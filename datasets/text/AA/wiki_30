Starship Girl Yamamoto Yohko

 
 is a Japanese light novel series written by Takashi Shōji and illustrated by Takashi Akaishizawa from 1993 to 2013. The series received three adaptations by J.C.Staff and Akiyuki Shinbo consisting of two 3-episode OVAs and a 26-episode television series. The anime series was released in the United States by The Right Stuf International on DVD in 2003.
Synopsis.
The series is set in 2999 AD, where two factions—TERRA and NESS—are engaged in a space war game to control planets. They fight with spaceships, which have been made to teleport their pilots back to the mother ship upon destruction. This results in the battles having no true casualties. Since the reflexes of people in the 30th century have greatly deteriorated, a TERRA engineer, Curtis Lawson, uses a time machine to go back 1000 years in time. There, he recruits four girls to fight for TERRA.
Characters.
Yohko is an active, sporty but cocky girl. She is a hardcore gamer, preferring space fight simulations, and is occasionally bribed using games. She pilots the Super Strike TA-29, armed with the all-powerful Everblack Cannon. Due to her obsession with games, she is required to put in a 100-yen coin into an arcade-like coin slot to start her starship.
Momiji is the second of TERRA's pilots. A long-haired, somewhat masculine girl, she speaks in the Kansai dialect. She's strong willed and a team player. She works part-time at a mini-market. She has a crush on Lawson, and for a short period believed that Yohko was attracted to him. She is the pilot of the Super Storm TA-23, armed with MRLs and Laser Arrays.
Yohko's best friend, Yohko trusts her and believes that Ayano's abilities would outmatch her own in the right circumstances. She's generally quiet and she truly cares and admires Yohko since childhood. She lives with her grandfather, the Master of the Hakuhouin-Ryū Judo Family.
She is the main comic relief of the series. She considers herself Yohko's rival, and strives to beat Yohko in all aspects, such as in sports, studies, and even gaming. Her efforts can be observed when she aspires to become a starship pilot, and her diligence in overcoming vertigo. She is very poised but kind of spoiled and happy-go-lucky.
The highest-ranking officer on board the Estanatreich. She was once a TERRA pilot, but was promoted to command. She once fought in a battle with Fluger known as Little Big Horn. She pilots the Super Twister TA-21 in the Zenga tournament, partnered with Fluger.
A genius engineer. He worked on the time travel machine that is used as the gateway between 1999 AD and 2999 AD.
The commander of Meo's 2nd Fleet, in charge of the Red Snappers—the aces of NESS. He is often represented riding on a white horse, which gives him the image of a knight. He is a capable leader, admired by Rouge and Yohko. Like Admiral Leon, he was also a former starship pilot who had been elevated in rank.
A clone of Yohko, created by Zenga using the Old Timer's Inheritance. Although biologically a girl, Zenga seems to have brought Yohsuke up to be a man. She first appears in the series as a young child, to observe Yohko's life. Later Yohsuke appears in the series in the guise of a man, and joins Madoka's class on the last day of school.
Media.
Anime.
The first OVA series was directed by Akiyuki Shinbo with character designs by Kazuto Nakazawa and music by Tomoki Hasegawa, and produced at J.C.Staff. Each episode was written by a different writer.
The second OVA series featured most of the same returning staff, but with music by Takeo Suzuki and Kazuhiko Toyama; and with screenwriter Mayori Sekijima from the first series acting as series composition writer.
The TV series featured much of the same staff as the second series, but with Akio Watanabe replacing Nakazawa as character designer, and with Shuuichi Kaneko joining as assistant director and Toshiaki Tetsura joining as visual director, the latter of whom director Shinbo described as indispensable to the development of the series. The series was the first collaboration between Shinbo and Watanabe, a relationship that has carried on through the 2020s. For the series, Shinbo wanted to have a more "realistic" approach to the characters while still keeping their "cute" qualities and had found out about Watanabe's work while doing research. He asked J.C.Staff animation producer Yuuji Matsukura to offer the role of character designer to Watanabe; and Watanabe, who knew about Shinbo and was a fan of his directorial debut "Metal Fighter Miku" (also produced by J.C.Staff), accepted the job. Discussing the narrative aspects of the work, Shinbo discussed the initial story with Sekijima and decided to make a narrative similar to Osamu Dezaki's TV adaptation of "Space Cobra". As pre-production started, Shinbo gave up his New Years' vacation in order to storyboard the first episode. Watanabe noted difficulty as both a first-time character designer and chief animation director in-part due to the fact that he had trouble understanding different lenses and perspectives that Shinbo liked to use (such as wide angles, bird's eye views, and worm's eye views). In recommendation, assistant director Kaneko suggested that Watanabe watch the works of Akio Jissoji to better understand the concepts.

Coordinated vulnerability disclosure

In computer security, coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD, sometimes known as responsible disclosure) is a vulnerability disclosure model in which a vulnerability or an issue is disclosed to the public only after the responsible parties have been allowed sufficient time to patch or remedy the vulnerability or issue. This coordination distinguishes the CVD model from the "full disclosure" model.
Developers of hardware and software often require time and resources to repair their mistakes. Often, it is ethical hackers who find these vulnerabilities. Hackers and computer security scientists have the opinion that it is their social responsibility to make the public aware of vulnerabilities. Hiding problems could cause a feeling of false security. To avoid this, the involved parties coordinate and negotiate a reasonable period of time for repairing the vulnerability. Depending on the potential impact of the vulnerability, the expected time needed for an emergency fix or workaround to be developed and applied and other factors, this period may vary between a few days and several months.
Coordinated vulnerability disclosure may fail to satisfy security researchers who expect to be financially compensated. At the same time, reporting vulnerabilities with the expectation of compensation is viewed by some as extortion. Some organizations have set up a bug bounty program to reward reporting vulnerabilities through proper channels. These include Facebook, Google, and Barracuda Networks.
Disclosure policies.
Google Project Zero has a 90-day disclosure deadline which starts after notifying vendors of vulnerability, with details shared in public with the defensive community after 90 days, or sooner if the vendor releases a fix.
ZDI has a 120-day disclosure deadline which starts after receiving a response from the vendor.

Tibor Csík

 
Tibor Csík 2 September, 1927- was a bantamweight professional boxer from Hungary, who won the gold medal at the 1948 Summer Olympics.
He was born in Jászberény into a poor family. He began boxing in featherweight and later changed to bantamweight. A two-time Hungarian champion from 1946 and 1948, his biggest success was the Olympic Games gold medal he won in London.
Csik had an easy route to the semi-finals, as his first opponent was disqualified, and his quarter final opponent Jimmy Carruthers of Australia, was forced to withdraw due to an eye injury. In the final, Csik won a decision over Giovanni Zuddas of Italy, to win the gold medal. After his return to Hungary he was awarded the honorary citizenship of Jászberény.
He actively participated in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, which eventually was struck down by the invading Soviet Army and Csík had to flee Hungary. He settled in Australia, where he died in 1976. He was buried in Sydney.

Vision for perception and vision for action

Vision for perception and vision for action in neuroscience literature refers to two types of visual processing in the brain: visual processing to obtain information about the features of objects such as color, size, shape (vision for perception) versus processing needed to guide movements such as catching a baseball (vision for action). An idea is currently debated that these types of processing are done by anatomically different brain networks. Ventral visual stream subserves vision for perception, whereas dorsal visual stream subserves vision for action. This idea finds support in clinical research and animal experiments.
Visual Processing in the Brain.
Visual stimuli have been known to process through the brain via two streams: the dorsal stream and the ventral stream. The dorsal pathway is commonly referred to as the ‘where’ system; this allows the processing of location, distance, position, and motion. This pathway spreads from the primary visual cortex dorsally to the parietal lobe. Information then feeds into the motor cortex of the frontal lobe. The second pathway, the ventral stream, processes information relating to shape, size, objects, orientation, and text. This is commonly known as the ‘what’ system. Visual stimuli in this system process ventrally from the primary visual cortex to the medial temporal lobe. In childhood development, vision for action and vision for perception develop at different rates, supporting the hypothesis of two distinct, linear streams for visual processing.
The above hypothesis has recently been challenged by a new and more parsimonious hypothesis with regard to evolution. The two streams must work hand-in-hand while processing visual information. Neuroanatomical and function neuroimaging studies have proven multiple visual maps that exist in the posterior brain, regarding at least 40 distinct regions. A single part of the outside world controls visual processing, and then particular areas are recognized in which single cells react to specific stimuli, such as faces. This hypothesis, one that indicates a more network-like model, is becoming more and more accepted among researchers. The pathway model mentioned above now experiences many conflicts. It has been discovered experimentally that there is more than just one way to process actions. For example, three distinct processing routes could exist dorsally, one for grasping, another for reaching, and yet a third for awareness of personal actions. No longer can just one dorsal stream be accounted for with regard to processing vision for action. The previous hypothesis also states that there is a clear hierarchy in which processing of visual stimuli goes from least complex to most complex in a linear fashion. However, lesions at one end should therefore have the same effect on the opposite end, and this cannot be observed experimentally. This further proves the integration of the two streams and many visual processes operating in parallel, involving multiple ventral and dorsal streams in a patchwork-type model.
However, while there exists to be two different hypotheses regarding the processing of vision in the human brain, it is still possible to accept both. Recent experiments prove that difficulties arise when deciphering between vision for action and vision for perception. A clear distinction between the two is difficult to make. Studies prove visual illusions that involve perception more so have considerable results on action. This can clearly rule out the first hypothesis noted above, indicating the thought that visually directed actions always avoid the matter of perception. However, a weaker form of the first hypothesis can still be considered. This states that the content of conscious perception will sometimes influence action, but that its impact on action is less asserted. Both the assumed ventral and dorsal streams can provide guidance of action, however information processed ventrally appears less pronounced and appears more substantial in the processing of perceptual tasks. It has been noted that one can still accept the two-stream hypothesis, but in doing so one must also realize that such a hypothesis still acknowledges the sharing of visual information across pathways and functions, heavily shaped by behavioral tasks.

Police Negotiating Board

The Police Negotiating Board (PNB) was a United Kingdom non-departmental public body established by Act of Parliament in 1980 to negotiate the pay and terms and conditions of employment of the British police. It was funded by the Home Office, and the Office of Manpower Economics provided the Board with an independent Secretariat. It was replaced by the Police Remuneration Review Body (PRRB) on 1 October 2014 in England and Wales but remained active in Scotland.
The PNB has an independent chairman and deputy chairman appointed by the Prime Minister, whose roles were to supply an independent voice in all negotiations.
Chairmen of the PNB included:
When agreement between the Staff Side and the Official Side cannot be reached after negotiation, nor subsequently resolved through conciliation, the relevant issues are referred to the Police Arbitration Tribunal (PAT). Awards by the PAT have the status of a recommendation by the PNB as if it were an agreement by both sides, so they are effectively binding on both the Staff and the Official sides of PNB due to paragraph 39 of the PNB Constitution, as noted by Lord Justice Keene in the judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision. However, such decisions are not binding on the Home Secretary, demonstrated by her decision on the 2007 police pay award, which was set aside for officers in England and Wales, who received 1.9% instead, although the award was implemented in full in Scotland. She stated that this necessary to maintain has not responded to comparisons of her decision to that of the Minister for Education, Ed Balls, who implemented a 2.5% pay award in full for all teachers.
There is cross-party concern that the Government's handling of the 2007 police pay award is seriously undermining the Police Negotiating Board machinery, and a national ballot of police officers by the Police Federation resulted in 86% of officers calling for the Police Federation of England and Wales to start to lobby for a change in legislation to allow police officers full industrial rights. Over 200 Members of Parliament have signed an Early Day Motion calling on the Government to reconsider its decision. The Motion was tabled by Home Affairs Select Committee Chairman Keith Vaz - a Labour MP — who has stated that:

Peter Pellandine

Peter John Pellandine (11 February 1927 – December 2012) was a British car designer and manufacturer who was influential in the field of specials/kit cars and steam-powered vehicles in both the United Kingdom and Australia.
Biography.
Peter John Pellandine was born in West Ham, London on 11 February 1927. He worked for the prestigious British coachbuilders H. J. Mulliner &amp; Co.
Ashley and Falcon cars.
In 1955 he left Mulliner's to form Ashley Laminates in partnership with Keith Waddington. The name "Ashley" was derived from the name of Pellandine's then home "Ashleigh" in Woodford Green. Ashley Laminates premises were first in a small garage in Epping New Road, Loughton quite close to Epping Forest.
A year later the partnership broke up amicably split and Pellandine founded Falcon Shells. Pellandine wanted to form a company he could grow and sell to enable him to emigrate. Falcon Shells was based at Waltham Abbey, and later at Hatfield. It had the rights to the short wheel base Ashley 750, which became the Falcon Mk 1 and the Ashley Sports Racer the Falcon Mk II.
Pellandine moved to New Zealand with family in 1957 and setting up a New Zealand branch of Falcon Shells, whilst continuing to operate Falcon Shells Ltd in UK. He returned to England via Australia in 1959 after closing down Falcon Shells (N.Z.). It is probable that Pellandine licensed Bill Ashton, formerly of Microplas and Weltex, and Ted George to continue making the Falcon under the Tiki brand in the 1960s. The Tiki is known to be based on the Ashley 750 body style. Pellandine continued to operate Falcon Shells Ltd in England until he sold it in 1962 to Mike Moseley and emigrated to Australia.
Australia and steam power.
Pellandine continued his involvement in car design at Cherry Gardens, South Australia with Pellandini Cars, which he founded in 1970. Pellandini Cars sold BMC Mini and Volkswagen based kit cars. During this time in South Australia Pellandine conducted state-sponsored experiments with a steam car. The state was seeking a solution to deal with a smog problem in Adelaide. He even made an attempt at the world steam car speed record on an Adelaide track in 1976. His car was being evaluated at about the same time as Edward Pritchard's steam-powered 1963 model Ford Falcon was being evaluated by the Australian Federal Government. Pellandine moved back to England in 1978.
Back in England at Thetford in Norfolk, he founded Pelland Engineering in 1978, which made the Volkswagen-based Pelland Sports kit car from the moulds used from 1974 in Australia. Pelland Engineering introduced its Alfa Romeo Alfasud based Pelland Sports kit car in 1989. Pellandine's design was sold to Ryder Cars in 1980, then to Graham Autos, and then to Listair. Listair remodeled the car and sold it as the Dash. From 1990 Dash Sports Cars built the remodeled car, but in the mid 1990s Richard Bell acquired the rights and moved construction to Dana Point, Southern California.
Pelland Steamer.
Returning to his interest in steam-powered cars in the 1980s, Pellandine created, with Pelland Engineering, the Pelland Steamer. He hoped to break steam car landspeed record. but was unsuccessful. The Mk II is on display at the Lakeland Motor Museum in Backbarrow, Cumbria.
Pellandine moved back to Australia in the 1990s, where he continued to develop the Steamer, the final version being the Mark IV. Pellandine died in Tasmania in December 2012, at the age of 85.

Vittorio Miele

Vittorio Miele (November 24, 1926, Cassino – November 18, 1999, Cassino) was an Italian painter.
Biography.
Vittorio Miele was born in Cassino in 1926 and he lived the tragedy of the Second World War, during the Battle of Monte Cassino where his father and his little sister died. His mother later died of her injuries.
Vittorio Miele survived and he went to Northern Italy.
In 1958, he participated in the Mantova City National Art Exhibition and in 1966 he had his first one-man exhibition in Frosinone.
In 1969, with the painting "Il Dolore" he was awarded the second prize at the International Painting Exhibition in Piervert, in France and with the painting "Case di Ciociaria" he was awarded the first prize at the Exhibition "Figurative Arts Province" in Rome.
In 1971, the Administration of the Republic of San Marino invited him to hold a one-man exhibition at the Ridotto of the Titano Theatre. In July 1971, thousands of people visited this exhibition.
In 1972, some of his paintings were chosen, together with those of De Chirico, Campigli, Gentilini, Cantore and Greco for a collective exhibition in the "2000" Gallery in Tokyo, the only gallery specialized in the presentation and popularisation of contemporary art in Japan. His international experience enriches after only one year. In June 1973, with "L'ultimo Gradino" and "Passaggio Ciociaro" he is present in the Arts Pavillon in Sarajevo.
In October, the Provincaial Tourist Organization in Frosinone awarded him the gold medal for "having contributed to the revival of Art in Ciociaria". In Autumn 1974 was ready for his first trip to North America. The Canadian press and television present the exhibitions Miele holds in the major Canadian cities. In October he exhibited, with great success, over one hundred paintings in Place Bonaventure in Montreal.
In November he held a one-man exhibition in Toronto at the Hilton Hotel and also participated with other important contemporary artists at the Fine Arts Gallery exhibition.
Vittorio Miele worked hard during those two months, even outdoors, trying to physically capture the harsh climate in his paintings. Paintings of particular interest remain from that Canadian period, linked to that fatal symbiosis established between the master's "provincial luggage" and the temerarious clash with immeasurable perfectionism. The Nordic houses become Ciociaria countryside cottages.
In the 1970s, he was invited to Yugoslavia, guest of the State Artist Colony in Počitelj. There he discovered the freshness of the oriental archaic culture. He began to paint outdoors again, the style become less "harsh", the Bosnian mountains become "rounded" and the shadows are softly superimposed. He discovered a luminosity lost in his years of travelling.
After a lot of other expositions in Italy and in the US, in 1991, he exhibited at the European Parliament.
He died in his home in Cassino on 18 November 1999, after many months of lucid agony.

R5 expressway (Slovakia)

R5 is a very short expressway () in northwestern Slovakia.
It will connect Žilina Region with Ostrava agglomeration. It starts on highway interchange with D3 just north of Čadca and ends at the border with the Czech Republic. Česká cesta I/68 is built in the parameters of an expressway, in the border section then in the parameters of an expressway in a half profile. It is connected to the Czech highway D48. With a length of less than two kilometers, R5 will be the shortest expressway in Slovakia after its completion. The European Route E75 will follow its route.
In the technical studies, several variants were assessed, including zero (rejection of construction) and the extension of the existing road I/11 to the parameters of a half-profile expressway. The null variant and the road widening variant were rejected and two similar variants were shortlisted. In the red variant, a level connection of the built-up part of the village Svrčinovec to R5 is considered. The green variant with level crossings does not count.
In June and 2010, the Ministry of the Environment issued an opinion in which the Ministry, from the point of view of environmental studies, recommends the construction of the red variant in a width arrangement of 11.5 meters (half profile) in the first stage. After the intersections are full, he proposes to rebuild the red variant into a green one in the second stage, i.e. level crossings into mímóvrňové. After the year 2040, or after the capacity of the semi-profile road is filled, the Ministry recommends the completion of the second lane in a width arrangement of 22.5 meters.
According to reports from September 2020, there is a threat of cancellation of road construction. The National Highway Company does not consider the road in the construction of the ecoduct, the bridge for animals, which was originally part of the R5 construction plan. According to another statement, R5 remains in the construction plan, but further progress will follow only after the completion of the D3 highway. The planned cost is €58 million, with a length of 1.7 kilometers, it is €34 million per kilometer, which is comparable to the tunnel bypass of Žilina and Strečno on the D1. According to the current plans of the Ministry of Transport, the R5 road will not be constructed or open until 2028. She was not included in the plans, regardless of the high level of preparation. With regard to the highway nature of the Czech road I/11, after the completion of its connection to the D48 highway in December 2022, a significant increase in traffic intensity on the R5 route can be expected. Nevertheless, taking into account the current intentions of the Ministry of Transport, the opening of the expressway cannot be expected before 2050.

Pellandini Cars

Pellandini Cars was a manufacturer of kit cars during the early 1970s that was located in South Australia.
History.
Englishman Peter Pellandine founded Pellandini Cars Ltd in 1970 at Cherry Gardens, South Australia. He first produced a curvy, gull-wing coupe that used a mid-mounted BMC Mini drivetrain of 1100 or 1275cc capacity. Alloy wheels were 10-inch at the front and 12 inches at the rear. The body was made of GRP with an integral GRP chassis. The suspension points were individually mounted directly to the GRP chassis as were the engine mounts. The seats were part of the chassis and not adjustable: instead the pedals moved. Even the steering rack was bolted to the GRP bulkhead. The car weighed 480kg and did 0 to 100 km in 5 secs. It had a one-piece nose section that hinged at the front which concealed the radiator and spare wheel.
Pellandine also offered a roadster version in 1974 but these proved less popular. In all, seven coupés were sold. Most of these cars still remain, some having been rebuilt after motor racing accidents.
Pellandine also embarked on a project to build a practical steam car with a contract from the South Australian Government. It used a double-acting two-cylinder 40hp engine mounted in the rear of a two-seater, with the condenser mounted on the rear deck like a racing wing. This steam car is now at the National Motor Museum at Birdwood South Australia.
Pellandini Cars wound up in 1978 before Pellandine returned to England, where he produced two further models both using a fibreglass monocoque chassis and mid-mounted engines.

Vladimir Nazor Award

The Vladimir Nazor Award () is a Croatian prize for arts and culture established in 1959, and awarded every year by the country's Ministry of Culture.
Named after the writer Vladimir Nazor (1876–1949), the prize is awarded to Croatian artists for achievements in six different fields of art and culture. In each category two separate prizes are awarded: one for life achievement, in recognition of their career in their respective field; and another one, commonly referred to as the "annual award," for a single piece of outstanding work in the winner's field, created over the previous 12 months. 
The winners for the preceding year are usually announced around May, and the prizes are handed out in an official ceremony held around in June or July, loosely coinciding with 19 June, the anniversary of Nazor's death in 1949.

Blackmail (album)

Blackmail (stylised as blackmail) is the debut album by the artist of the same name, released through BluNoise Records. The album consisted of tracks that the band was able to record in a high-tech recording studio that was readily lent to them by a German producer legend named Stuart Bruce who was impressed with their demo-recordings. Bruce, as well as Guido Lucas, produced the album. Guido Lucas started his own record label in Koblenz known as Records. Blackmail was able to secure his support, after many other record labels turned down their request to be taken in. The album, however, still did not get a very positive consumer response.

Sweet itch

Also known as Queensland itch, seasonal recurrent dermatitis (SSRD), summer itch or more technically, "Culicoides" hypersensitivity.
Sweet itch is a medical condition in equines caused by an allergic response to the bites of "Culicoides" midges. It may be found in horses and ponies, especially in the warmer regions. It may also occur, too, in other equines. It is also found in Canada, Australia, the US and many other parts of the world.
Causes.
A hypersensitivity reaction to specific allergens (protein molecules causing an extreme immune response in sensitised individuals) in the saliva of "Culicoides" midges. There are multiple allergens involved, although some works claim that the larger proteins (of molecular weight 65kDa) are the most important. These allergens appear to be cross-reactive across many species of "Culicoides" - i.e. many different varieties of midges produce similar allergens, giving the same effects upon horses.
The hypersensitivity response is mediated by IgE, an antibody produced by the horse's immune system which binds the allergens, causing a cascade production of histamine and cytokines which make the horse's skin inflamed and itchy. Of these, histamine appears the most important in the initial phase of reaction.
Treatment and prevention.
Few treatments are fully efficacious once lesions have appeared. The only effective form of treatment is preventative - i.e. prevent further insect bites - so these techniques will also be discussed here. Treatments generally fall into one of the following categories:
Overall, the wide variety of treatments proposed leads to the conclusion that no one method is universally effective.

The Big Dish (band)

The Big Dish are a Scottish pop band formed in Airdrie, Scotland in 1983. The band initially comprised Steven Lindsay (vocals/guitar), David Brownlie (drums), Stuart Hall (saxophone), Mark Ryce (guitar), and John Harper (keyboards). The band was subsequently augmented on stage by Paul Albertis (bass) and John Hendry (drums). As well as releasing three studio albums, the band performed live as support to Lloyd Cole and Big Country and Del Amitri.
Career.
By the time their debut album "Swimmer" was released on Virgin Records in 1986 the line-up had undergone notable changes. Lindsay and Raymond Docherty were joined by new guitarist Brian McFie, keyboardist/saxophonist Ian Ritchie (album recordings only), Allan Dumbreck (live performances) on keyboards and Dave Cantwell (live performances) replacing John Hendry on drums. Tracks on "Swimmer" were significantly polished versions of the tracks that had been played live up until then.
Lindsay, McFie and Docherty then completed the follow-up album "Creeping Up on Jesus" in 1988 with session musicians — including drummer Blair Cunningham and horn men Gary Barnacle &amp; John Thirkell, Craig Armstrong and Paul Wickens (keyboards). Despite Bruce Lampcov's muscular production, this second effort proved commercially unsuccessful and the band was dropped from Virgin, when Lindsay refused to countenance recording a cover version.
Lindsay and McFie recorded the band's last album "Satellites" for the American East West label (a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records) in 1991. They had assistance from Armstrong, Docherty, record producer Warne Livesey and a number of session musicians, including bassist Pino Palladino and drummer Manu Katché. They also put together a new touring line-up featuring bassist Tracey Gilbert, drummer Skip Reid and Colin Berwick on keyboards. However, despite critical acclaim for the new record and a hit single ("Miss America" reached No. 37 in the UK Singles Chart), the group disbanded shortly afterwards.
A compilation of the group's work entitled "Rich Man's Wardrobe" was released by Virgin Records in 1994, featuring cuts from the band's two albums with the label, and the inclusion of rare track "Voodoo Baby".
Post-Big Dish.
Not long after the split, Lindsay resumed his partnership with Armstrong. Lindsay provided vocals on Armstrong's 2002 album "As If to Nothing". To promote this release, Lindsay returned to the live arena, performing throughout Europe with a thirty-piece orchestra.
Lindsay returned to the fold in late 2004 on his own Seminal label with the piano-driven "Exit Music" featuring string arrangements by the Scottish Ensemble. Lindsay plays and programmes all other instruments. The Australian edition of the album contains two additional tracks. Lindsay was then signed to Chrysalis Records, and in 2007 the second solo CD "Kite" was released, including a cover of "Monkey Gone to Heaven", originally by Pixies.
Reunion.
The band reunited to play a sold-out show at Glasgow ABC on 21 January 2012 as part of the Celtic Connections festival, and the Darvel Music Festival in May 2012. The lineup for the reunion was Lindsay, McFie, Docherty, Dumbreck and Ross McFarlane (drums). One new song 'Cherry Blossom Falls' was included in the set. In 2014 Big Dish supported Del Amitri at the Hydro.

The Armed Forces' Pay Review Body is a United Kingdom non-departmental public body (and a Review Body) established to review and recommend the pay and terms and conditions of employment of the British armed forces. It is funded by the Ministry of Defence, and the Office of Manpower Economics provides the Review Body with an independent Secretariat.
The Review Body is to have regard for the need for the pay of the Armed Forces to be broadly comparable with pay levels in civilian life. Its reports and recommendations are submitted jointly to the Secretary of State for Defence and the Prime Minister.
The AFPRB has an independent chairman and deputy chairman appointed by the Prime Minister, whose roles are to supply an independent voice in all negotiations. In 2013 the chairman's appointment was not renewed after the government rejected his call for a rise of half of one percent in the "X-factor" to compensate for Coalition defence cuts. The Chief Executive of the Army Families Federation described the failure to renew his appointment as a punitive "sacking" based on Smith's defiance of an order to limit pay rises for the military.

Dora Gordine

Dora Gordine (8 June 1895 – 29 December 1991) was an Estonian Jewish Modernist figurative and portraitist sculptor. Her early career was influenced by the Noor Eesti (‘Young Estonia’) group of artists who favoured Art Nouveau. She moved to Paris and on her third marriage, to Hon. Richard Hare (1907–66), her career expanded to the extent that some critics regarded her as amongst the finest sculptors of her generation. She specialized in portrait sculptures attracting international admirers from the political, social, artistic, literary and theatrical worlds. Her legacy also includes a number of public space pieces. Her latter career was not as prolific or as fêted and Gordine was relatively unknown at the time of her death. Major exhibitions in London in 2006 and 2009 have revived her standing and her former home is now a museum.
Early life.
Dora Gordine's childhood has not been well documented. There is confusion over her date of birth with various dates 1895 (likely), 1898 and 1906 mentioned. She was the youngest of four children born to Morduch ("Mark") Gordin and Emma Ester Schepshelewitch, both Russian Jews, in Liepāja, Latvia, at a time when it was still part of the Russian Empire. Two of her siblings, Nikolai and Anna, died at the hands of the Nazis in Tallinn, Estonia in 1941. Another brother, Leopold, moved to London, where he lived until his death. The Gordin family evidently belonged to a comfortable middle class. There was money available to pay Gordine's elder brother, Leopold, to study engineering at Edinburgh University. Later, it seems that Gordine's father was also prepared to pay for Gordine's elder sister, Anna, to study at one of Tallinn's leading art schools.
By 1912 the Gordin family had moved to Tallinn, Estonia. It is clear that Gordine's approach to sculpture was considerably shaped by the example of the pre-First World War Noor Eesti (‘Young Estonia’) a group of artists who championed Art Nouveau in the country. She exhibited bronze sculptures in Tallinn in 1917, 1920 and 1921. In the autumn of 1924 she went to Paris to study a course in French civilisation, improving her knowledge of contemporary French sculptural practice. Then, surrounded by galleries and salons, she "instinctively felt a correlation between the rhythms of music and sculpture" and developed her sculptural vision. Gordin gallicised her surname by adding an "e" perhaps in an effort to make it sound more Russian and always denied or deflected suggestions that she was Jewish.
In 1925 she worked as a painter on a mural for the British Pavilion at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts, in Paris. It provided the means to cast a bronze for exhibition at the Beaux Arts Society. The following year she was invited to exhibit at the Salon des Tuileries where her design of the head &amp; torso of a Chinese philosopher earned enthusiastic reviews; The Straits Times (1932) wrote: "Like Byron, one morning Dora Gordine woke up famous". Between 1929 and 1935 she sculpted bronzes for the City Hall, Singapore. Leicester Galleries in London presented Gordine's sculpture in a solo show in 1928. It was a huge success and all her work was sold, amongst which was "Javanese Head" bought by Samuel Courtauld for the Tate Gallery collection.
Marriage.
After a brief marriage to a Wladimir Rolow in Estonia, in 1930 she married Englishman Dr George Herbert Garlick in Singapore. In 1936 she married her third husband, the Hon. Richard Gilbert Hare (5 September 1907 – 1966), son of Richard Granville Hare, 4th Earl of Listowel and Freda Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone on 21 November 1936. Through her marriage she became part of a liberal aristocratic cultural elite. The independent income from Hare allowed Dora to build Dorich House in Kingston Vale, her studio and a showcase for her work. As well as, a showcase for their collections of Indian, Chinese and nineteenth-century Russian art and furniture.
Career.
Her husband introduced her to London society figures, many of whom sat for her, Dame Edith Evans, Dame Beryl Grey, Dorothy Tutin, Siân Phillips, Emlyn Williams, Sir Kenneth Clark, John Pope-Hennessy and Professor F. Brown, Head of the Slade School of Art. There were also overseas commissions including the "Kwa Nin", whose head sculpture Gordine called "The Chinese Lady of Peace" and a low-relief at Gray's Inn to Sun Yat-Sen, the former leader of China.
Each portrait head had its own patina according to Gordine's vision of her sitter. When interviewed by the BBC in 1972 Gordine commented that, "when you do portrait busts of somebody you do their noses and mouth – but it is nothing. You have to imagine what they are like inside and bring out their inner feeling and then put it in a form".
At the outbreak of World War II, Gordine's career was brought to a halt. She no longer had access to Valsuani's in Paris, her favourite foundry, and bronze quickly became rationed. All foundries in Britain were ordered stop all non-essential activity and concentrate on war production. It was not until late 1943 or early 1944 that she found a new foundry and was able to have some of her latest bronze work exhibited in the Royal Academy in 1944. During the 1940s/50s Gordine's work was exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, the Society of Portrait Sculptors and elsewhere. In October 1945 she had a solo exhibition at the Leicester Galleries, in which The Times described her as having ‘much ability, though she is eclectic in her inspiration, being influenced by works from many schools and periods – Indian and Egyptian among others. Her best works are her portrait heads in bronze which are convincing and straightforward.’ Bronzes from this time have ironic or humorous titles, relating to the pose, such as "Great Expectations" or "Mischief" and, of an RAF officer, "Above Cloud". She was elected a Fellow of the Royal British Society of Sculptors in 1949. She occasionally did exotic or erotic pieces (e.g. for Elizabeth Choy). She travelled and lectured in America, working in Hollywood, art lecturing and designing film sets in 1947 and revisited the US in 1959.
In 1948 she was commissioned to produce a sculpture to stand in the new mother and baby unit at Holloway Prison in north London, paid for by the City financier and former suffragette Gordon Holmes. "Happy Baby" was largely forgotten by 2009, languishing in an administration block at the prison for many years. Now regarded as an important piece in 'La Gordine's' professional history it formed the centre piece of an exhibition of her work at Kingston University in February–March 2009. Her work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.
In 1960 Esso commissioned a 2.1 m x 1.5 m (7' x 5') low-relief "Power" for their new Milford Haven Refinery, which was unveiled by the Duke of Edinburgh. Gordine's last public commission, the 2–5 m (8') long "Mother and Child" was made for the entrance hall of the Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, in 1963.
Widowhood and death.
Her husband's sudden death in 1966 from a heart attack left Gordine to live out her life alone in Dorich House. She had no children. As Gordine's client base became smaller and health problems undermined her ability to work to the standard she had during the 1920s, her eyesight deteriorated and she had arthritis in her shoulders and arms causing her career to end in the 1970s. She had a great interest in her garden and, in particular, herbs and plants used for medicinal purposes, such as Tansy. Adrian Howes and Robert Ruthven were her part-time gardeners for nearly two years in the mid-1970s. She often invited the members of the Royal Ballet School to Dorich house to pose for her. She died in Dorich House in December 1991, aged around 96.
In subsequent years her work was to be revived by major exhibitions in London in 2006 at the Ben Uri Gallery in the Jewish Museum London, and in 2009 at Dorich House and Kingston University.
Dorich House.
Dorich House was designed by Gordine and completed in 1936. The name chosen for the house was a portmanteau of Dora and Richard's names. The house is spread across three floors; the ground and first floors devoted to the production and display of Gordine's work, with the upper floor forming the couple's private apartment. In 1994, it was acquired by Kingston University and was refurbished and formally opened as a museum in 1996, housing Gordine's collection of bronze and plaster sculptures and many of her paintings and drawings. There are also items from Hare's Imperial Russian art collection, which includes icons, paintings, ceramics, glassware, metalwork, folk art and furniture dating from the early 18th century to the early 20th century.

Claude Marie Dubuis

Claude Marie Dubuis (March 10, 1817 – May 22, 1895) was a French-born prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as the second bishop of the Diocese of Galveston in Texas. from 1862 until his death in 1892. He founded the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word.
Biography.
Early life.
Claude Dubuis was born on March 10, 1817, to François and Antoinette (Dubost) Dubuis, in Coutouvre, Loire, where he was raised on his parents' farm. At age ten, he went live with his uncle, a member of a religious order, to prepare for seminary. In 1833, Dubius entered the seminary at Sainte-Foy-l'Argentière. However, his preparation was insufficient, particularly in Greek language, and Dubius dropped out after six months.
After leaving the seminary, Dubius returned to his home in Têche to work as a day laborer. However, he decided to prepare again for seminary and went to a different tutor in a nearby village. After studying Latin, Greek, and French grammar for eight months, he entered a minor seminary in Saint-Jodard, where he passed all of his courses. He then returned to the seminary at Sainte-Foy-l'Argentière. where he later graduated with honors. In 1840, Dubius entered the major seminary of St. Irenaeus at Lyons.
Priesthood.
On June 1, 1844, Dubuis was ordained into the priesthood for the Archdiocese of Lyon by Cardinal Louis-Jacques-Maurice de Bonald in Lyon. In 1846, Dubuis met Bishop Jean Marie Odin, the apostolic vicar for Texas. Odin was in Lyon recruiting priests to work for the Apostolic Vicarate of Texas, which then incorporated all of the new State of Texas. Dubius decided to immigrate to the United States.
In late 1846, Dubuis sailed with several other recruited priests from Le Harve in France to New Orleans. After arriving in Louisiana in early 1847, he was sent to learn English at the St. Mary's of the Barrens seminary in Perryville, Missouri.
Dubius returned later in 1847 to Texas, where he was assigned as pastor of a parish in Castroville. The parishioners were mainly German or Alsatian immigrants. They had a very small church and a crude hut for the priest to live in. Dubius started learning the Alsatian language, then began building a new residence for the clergy. He opened a new school and was teaching 80 students within the first year.
Dubuis travelled through his parish on foot or on horseback. On one occasion, he spent a night in a tree to escape surging floodwaters. Dubuis often had to ride through Comanche territory and was detained four times by Native Americans. Some Native Americans would occasionally stop by the Castroville church to listen to the music. By 1850, Dubuis had constructed a second, larger church.
In 1850, Bishop Odin sent Dubuis to France to recruit missionaries and visit his family. After returning to Texas in 1851, he was appointed pastor of San Fernando Parish in San Antonio, Texas, and vicar general of the diocese. At San Fernando, announcements from the pulpit were made in English, French, German, and Spanish. At first, Dubuis was not sufficiently conversant in Spanish to administer the last rites, Odin stayed in San Antonio until a Spanish-speaking priest arrived to assist him.
On February 15, 1861, Bishop Odin was appointed archbishop of the Diocese of New Orleans. Dubuis traveled to New Orleans in June 1861 as he was planning another recruiting trip to Europe. However, with the start of the American Civil War in April 1861, the Union Navy started blockading the port of New Orleans. Bishop Odin, who was recommending Dubius as his replacement, left for Europe that year to get Vatican approval of austerity measures he wanted to enact on the archdiocese. Dubuis probably did not make it out of New Orleans until April 1862.
Bishop of Galveston.
On October 21, 1862, Pope Pius IX appointed Dubuis as the second bishop of the Diocese of Galveston. He was consecrated by Bishop Odin on November 23, 1862, in Lyon.
In May 1863, Dubuis traveled from France to Galveston. After the end of the war, Dubuis established additional parishes, hospitals and schools. In September 1865, the Sisters of St. Joseph in New Orleans requested that Archbishop Odin to send Dubuis to take confessions, as their usual confessor was unavailable and "Dubuis is so humble that he would come."
In 1866, cholera broke out in the diocese. Unable to persuade an American religious congregations to come to Galveston, Dubuis persuaded the Sisters of Divine Providence from Saint-Jean-de-Bassel in France to come instead. During his tenure as bishop, he brought almost seventy religious congregations into Texas. On one trip to Europe, he secured the services of the Congregation of the Resurrection to minister to the Polish community in Texas. Dubuis founded the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, a community that came to play a significant role in the provision of healthcare services in Texas. In 1873, at Dubuis' request, the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur in Lockport, New York established the Academy of the Sacred Heart for girls in Waco, Texas.
Dubuis returned to Castroville as bishop to lay the cornerstone for the third Church of St. Louis. In 1866, Dubuis made his first episcopal visit to the Corpus Christi area, returning the following year. As early as 1870 Dubuis, began sending Father Vincent Perrier twice a year to visit Fort Worth, Texas. Dubuis attended the First Vatican Council in Rome from 1869 to 1870. In 1874, the Diocese of Galveston was split when the western half of Texas was established as the Diocese of San Antonio.
Retirement and legacy.
Suffering from poor health, Dubuis left Galveston in 1881 to permanently return to France, settling at Vernaison in the Metropolis of Lyon. He left the diocese under the supervision of coadjutor bishop for the next 12 years. Pope Leo XIII accepted his resignation as bishop of Galveston on December 16, 1892, and named Dubuis titular archbishop of "Arca in Armenia". In retirement, Dubuis assisted Cardinal Pierre-Hector Coullié, the bishop of Lyons, in episcopal work.
Claude Dubuis died in Vernaison on May 22, 1895.

Willi A. Kalender

Willi A. Kalender (1 August 1949 – 20 October 2024) was a German medical physicist and professor and former chairman of the Institute of Medical Physics of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. Kalender has produced several new technologies in the field of diagnostic radiology imaging.
Kalender was a Fellow of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) and Honorary Fellow of the British Institute of Radiology (BIR) and of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM). Kalender was also elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering (2016) for the development of spiral computed tomography methods that enable modern high-speed 3D medical imaging with X-rays.
Education.
Kalender started his studies in physics and mathematics at the University of Bonn, Germany. He completed his master's and Ph.D. degree in medical physics at the University of Wisconsin in 1974 and 1979, respectively. In 1988 he completed all postdoctoral lecturing qualifications (Habilitation) at the University of Tübingen, Germany. In order to get a better grasp of the subject, he took and successfully completed all courses in the pre-clinical medicine curriculum.
Career.
From 1979 to 1995 Kalender worked in the research laboratories of Siemens Medical Systems in Erlangen, Germany; he was appointed head of the Medical Physics group in 1988. In 1991 he became Adjunct Associate Professor of Medical Physics at the University of Wisconsin. In 1995 he was appointed full professor and chairman of the newly established Institute of Medical Physics at the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. In 1999 he became distinguished visiting professor to the Department of Radiology at Stanford University.
Death.
Kalender died on 20 October 2024, at the age of 75.
Research and development achievements.
Kalender conducted research mainly in the area of diagnostic radiology imaging with a clear focus on special CT applications. The goals of and motivation for his projects were mostly derived from observations during patient exams in clinical radiology.
Kalender was involved in the development of the world's first product options for dual-energy CT [1] in 1983 and for metal artifact reduction (MAR) in 1987.
Kalender developed volumetric spiral computed tomography; the world's first clinical spiral CT studies were presented at RSNA 1989. The combination of continuous data acquisition with slip-ring-based data transmission and continuous table translation led to considerable reduction of examination times, to an essential reduction of motion artifacts and image quality significantly improved by providing isotropic spatial resolution as a decisive feature.
Kalender developed angio-CT [4] and heart phase-specific cardiac imaging.
Other highly important fields of W. Kalender's research have been radiation protection and the development of intelligent and very efficient dose reduction approaches such as tube current modulation [7] and the optimization of the choice of x-ray spectra. They allow reducing the patient dose by an order of magnitude in many cases without impairing image quality. 
From 2008 to 2019 Kalender's research was focused on the development of an efficient breast-CT system to improve the early detection of breast cancer. The scanner and in particular the development of its high-resolution photon-counting detector design allow scanning the breast with a dose similar to that of digital mammography, but with much higher resolution and clarity than mammography due to superposition-free fully 3D-resolution of breast-CT. The introduction into clinical practice was performed in 2018 at the University Spital Zurich (Swiss).
Kalender founded several university spinoff companies to transfer scientific results into products and small business.
Publications.
Kalender authored 963 publications, including 286 original scientific papers;
his Hirsch-index is cited with a 69 (ISI-Web of Knowledge, 2018).

Van der Grinten projection

The van der Grinten projection is a compromise map projection, which means that it is neither equal-area nor conformal. Unlike perspective projections, the van der Grinten projection is an arbitrary geometric construction on the plane. Van der Grinten projects the entire Earth into a circle. It largely preserves the familiar shapes of the Mercator projection while modestly reducing Mercator's distortion. Polar regions are subject to extreme distortion. Lines of longitude converge to points at the poles.
History.
Alphons J. van der Grinten invented the projection in 1898 and received US patent #751,226 for it and three others in 1904. The National Geographic Society adopted the projection for their reference maps of the world in 1922, raising its visibility and stimulating its adoption elsewhere. In 1988, National Geographic replaced the van der Grinten projection with the Robinson projection.
Geometric construction.
The geometric construction given by van der Grinten can be written algebraically:
formula_1
where "x" takes the sign of , "y" takes the sign of "φ", and
formula_2
If "φ" = 0, then
formula_3
Similarly, if "λ" = "λ" or "φ" = ±/2, then
formula_4
In all cases, "φ" is the latitude, "λ" is the longitude, and "λ" is the central meridian of the projection.
Van der Grinten IV projection.
The van der Grinten IV projection is a later polyconic map projection developed by Alphons J. van der Grinten.
The central meridian and equator are straight lines. All other meridians and parallels are arcs of circles.

Saudi Arabia national cricket team

The Saudi Arabia national cricket team is the team that represents the country of Saudi Arabia in international cricket. The team is organized by the Saudi Arabian Cricket Federation, which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2003 and an associate member in 2016. Saudi Arabia made its international debut at the 2004 ACC Trophy in Malaysia, and has since played regularly in Asian Cricket Council (ACC) tournaments. After finishing second in the 2014 ACC Elite League, the team qualified for the World Cricket League for the first time. Saudi Arabia was due to compete in the 2015 Division Six event, but members of the team were denied visas by the host country, forcing the team to withdraw.
History.
The international debut of the Saudi senior team came in the ACC Trophy in 2004, where they failed to progress beyond the first round. They again failed to go past the first round in 2006, but had the remarkable achievement of scoring 499 runs in 50 overs against Brunei. Earlier in the year they came fourth in the Middle East Cup.
Arguably their greatest moment in international cricket to date came in the 2008 ACC Trophy Elite when they defeated the UAE by 29 runs, a team which has had previous One Day International experience.
With the separation of the ACC Trophy into Elite and Challenge divisions, following their performance at the 2006 ACC Trophy Saudi Arabia they competed in the Elite division in the 2008 competition, in which they came 10th. This result relegated them to the 2009 ACC Trophy Challenge, in which they did not appear. They did, however, appear in the 2010 competition, in which they came 2nd and gained promotion back to the Elite division.
Besides the 50 over format, Saudi Arabia have also played in the Twenty20 format of the game in the 2007 ACC Twenty20 Cup, in which they failed to progress beyond the group stage, and the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup, in which they came 8th.
2018-present.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Saudi Arabia and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I. 
Saudi Arabia made its Twenty20 International debut on 20 January 2019, losing to Bahrain by 41 runs in the 2019 ACC Western Region T20 at Al Emarat Cricket Stadium, Muscat, Oman.
Saudi Arabia won the 2023 ACC Men's Challenger Cup in Thailand, finishing undefeated to qualify for the 2023 ACC Men's Premier Cup in Nepal. The team defeated Bahrain in the tournament final by 10 wickets, after bowling Bahrain out for just 26 runs.

Pelland Engineering

Pelland Engineering was a British engineering company that produced kit cars and made an attempt on the world land-speed record for steam cars.
The Pelland Sports.
On his return from Australia, Peter Pellandine set up Pelland Engineering at Thetford, Norfolk. In 1979, he began to manufacture kit cars developed from his Pellandini steam car. The two-seater Pelland Sports used the Volkswagen Beetle drivetrain but mounted backwards to create a mid-engined configuration. This was intended to enhance the dynamic characteristics of the car. The body shell was a GRP monocoque with VW front torsion bar suspension but Pellandine's own design traverse-leaf arrangement at the rear. It was essentially a roadster but a gull-wing hardtop was available.
The design was sold to Ryder Cars of Coventry in 1980 who marketed it as the Rembrandt and explored the feasibility of replacing the flat4 VW engine with a midmounted water cooled Ford Kent Crossflow engine. The company was then sold on to Graham Autos based in Tyneside. Very few cars were built by either business and some time later it was sold again to Listair.
Listair subtly updated the styling in the late 1980s and sold it as the Dash. They also offered the option of an Alfa Romeo Alfasud engine.
Dash Sports Cars of Chesterwood, Hereford then took on the project in 1990.
Around 1996/7 the project was sold to Richard Bell who moved from England and took the project with him to Dana Point in Southern California. Bell still owns 3 examples of the cars and continues to research the history of the marque.
Chris Evans based near Inverness, Scotland is the Owner, Secretary &amp; Treasurer of the Pelland Rembrant Register. The club boasts a small membership but as at April 2009 has located 19 surviving examples. Chris, himself, owns five cars of which two are complete runners whilst two of the others are undergoing restoration and the last one is in the final stages of modification prior to it being used as a basis to produce fresh moulds. This latest derivation, (Name to be decided), is a little larger and more practical but retains the character of Peter Pellandine's original creation.
Paul Pellandine built the first two VW powered versions in South Australia and the first UK model in 1979. He still has his now sky blue car in Northern NSW Australia completely restored.
The Dash demo car and moulds were passed on to Mel Hubberd of Manx Buggies in Norfolk, England.
The Pelland Steamer.
The Pelland Sports formed the basis of the first Pelland steam car called "The Steam Cat" This was the same fibreglass monocoque chassis and used a twin-cylinder double-acting compound engine. The car was built to a contract with the South Australian Government in 1974. It currently is at the National Motor museum at Birdwood South Australia. In 1977 the Pelland Mk II Steam Car was built. It was a project Pellandine had originally started in Australia with funding from the Australian government. It had a three-cylinder double-acting engine in a 'broad-arrow' configuration. This was mounted in a tubular steel chassis, with a Kevlar body giving a gross weight of just . Uncomplicated and robust, the steam engine was claimed to give trouble-free, efficient performance. It had huge torque () at zero engine revs, and could accelerate from 0 to in under 8 seconds.
Pellandine's intention was to break the world land-speed record for steam cars which stood at . He made a number of attempts to set a record, but was repeatedly thwarted by technical problems. The last attempt was in 1991. Subsequently sold at Christie's, this historic car can be viewed at the Lakeland Motor Museum in Backbarrow, Cumbria.
Pellandine moved back to Australia in the 1990s where he continued to develop the Steamer. The latest version is the Mark IV.
The Pelland Sports Mk II.
Peter Pellandine marketed an all-new version of his Pelland Sports in 1989. It also used a GRP monocoque but with bespoke double-wishbone suspension and a mid-mounted Alfa Romeo Alfasud powertrain. It was available in both roadster and coupé versions with traditional-style doors, rather than the gullwings of earlier projects. The car's roadholding was described as "superb" by Kitcars International magazine.

Procurement outsourcing

Procurement outsourcing is the transfer of specified key procurement activities relating to sourcing and supplier management to a third party — perhaps to reduce overall costs or maybe to tighten the company's focus on its core competencies. Procurement categorisation and vendor management of indirect materials and services (commonly referred to as Indirect procurement) are typically the most popular outsourced activity.
Overview.
Outsourced procurement teams allow companies to benefit immediately from experienced procurement specialists support &amp; expertise. This avoids the creation of an internal team (new resources) and the required time for that team to structure itself, its processes and its expertise.
Outsourced procurement is therefore an available solution for companies who Have no internal competencies but want to quickly benefit from procurement action (Cost reduction, suppliers and contract management...
- Have internal procurement expertise (department) but want to outsource activity on specific area(s) like indirect materials and services.
- Consider Procurement as a non strategic / core function and want to have it managed by a procurement service provider
- Want to develop quickly a procurement function to deliver savings, with a willingness to internally develop this function in the mid term
Procurement Outsourcing is being thought of in a big way in automobile manufacturers in India and China because with increasing number of cars being produced every passing day more man hours are required in trivial issues like timely delivery of materials. Hence Procurement team cannot concentrate on its core competency of negotiations and vendor selections.
Procurement categories.
Procurement specialists usually split procurement activities into two parts:

Nick Skelton

Nicholas David Skelton (born 30 December 1957, Bedworth, Warwickshire) is a British former equestrian who competed in show jumping. He retired at the age of 59 years old, on 5 April 2017. He began riding at age 18 months and in 1975 took two team silvers and an individual gold at the Junior European Championships.
He has competed numerous times at the European Show Jumping Championships, winning three golds, three silvers and three bronzes both individually and with the British team over 26 years. In 1980, he competed in the Alternative Olympics, where he helped the British team to a silver medal. He currently holds the British show jumping high jump record, which he set in 1978.
His most notable successes occurred in back-to-back Olympic Games in the swansong of his career. In 2012, at the age of 54, Skelton won an Olympic gold medal as part of the Great Britain team. Four years later, he won the individual Olympic gold medal at his seventh Olympic Games. Having won both team and individual Olympic gold, Skelton and his horse, Big Star, retired together shortly after the 2016 Games.
Education.
Born in Bedworth, north Warwickshire, Skelton was educated at Bablake School in the city of Coventry in Central England.
Career.
Skelton rode in pony classes with little tuition before taking his pony to Ted and Liz Edgar for help when he was 14. He worked for and helped at the Edgars for two years before leaving school with no qualifications to work full-time for them. Skelton had plenty of early success with a horse called Maybe, but he went lame just before the Junior European Championships in 1975 and his place in the team looked lost. However, a reputedly ordinary horse, O.K., was brought in as a substitute and Skelton won individual gold. After this, he began riding more of the Edgar horses and in 1978, at Olympia, jumped just over 7 foot 7 inches on Lastic to set a new British record, which still stands. When Skelton partnered with St James the following year he broke into the senior GB team, of which he remained an integral part until his retirement.
In 1985, Skelton split from the Edgars and went on his own; his main horse at the time, Apollo, went with him and together they formed a partnership that won nearly all the top prizes in the sport, as well as many Championship medals. After Apollo, Skelton competed at the top level with many different horses before he teamed up with Dollar Girl in 1992 with the specific target of competing at the Barcelona Olympics. Despite the Olympics going badly for them, Skelton and Dollar Girl ultimately won the coveted World Cup Final in Gothenburg in 1995.
In September 2000, Skelton broke his neck in a fall while competing. The injury was serious and could have ended his show jumping career, but after retiring in 2001 he recovered and began competing again in 2002. Skelton returned to the saddle to partner Arko III, a horse he had ridden before breaking his neck. Skelton and Arko won the British Open title in 2004 at the British Open Show Jumping Championships and many other top prizes. Their most disappointing moment came at the Athens Olympics in 2004, where they were leading until the final round but finished out of the medals.
After Arko retired, Skelton revisited an old friend and owner, Gary Widdowson, for support and new horses. Gary and his wife Beverley bought, or co-bought with Skelton, a number of competition horses including Carlo 273, Skelton's European Individual Bronze medal partner, Big Star and Unique.
Following his Olympic 2012 gold medal, the post boxes in both Alcester, where he resides, and in Bedworth, where he was born, were painted gold in his honour.
Skelton won gold in the 2016 Rio Olympics in the individual category. In doing so he became the oldest British Olympic gold medallist since 1908. Following Skelton's success at the 2016 Rio Olympics, rail operator London Midland honoured him with a gold-painted sign at Bedworth railway station. Skelton received a nomination for the 2016 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award. He received 109,197 votes, placing him third. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to equestrianism.
Major achievements.
Skelton has had many successes at home and abroad and has ridden on over 164 Nations Cups teams (1978–2011). He has won various medals both as an Individual and as part of the teams in the Olympics, World Championships and European Championships between 1980 and 2016.
Skelton currently holds the British Show Jumping High Jump record, at 7 ft 7in 5/16th (2.32m) set at Olympia in 1978 with Lastic.
Horses.
Top horses that Skelton has ridden include Maybe, If Ever, Apollo, St. James, Major Wager, Top Gun, Grand Slam, Phoenix Park, Dollar Girl, Limited Edition, Showtime, Tinka's Boy, Hopes are High, Russel and Arko III.
Skelton's current top flight horses are Big Star, Carlo 273 and Unique, all of which are owned by Beverley Widdowson.
Skelton won team gold at his home Olympics in London 2012 with his horse Big Star, alongside Ben Maher, Peter Charles and Scott Brash.
Personal life.
Skelton has two sons with his first wife Sarah Skelton (née Edwards) and both are active in horse racing. Daniel is a National Hunt trainer, and Harry is a National Hunt jockey who in 2009 became the youngest winner of the Irish Grand National on Niche Market and in 2020 won the Queen Mother Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival.
He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to equestrian sport.
In 2001, Skelton published an autobiography, "Only Falls And Horses" and wrote a second, "Gold", in 2018.

Barry and Stuart

Barry Jones and Stuart MacLeod are a duo of Scottish BAFTA-nominated magicians and comedians whose work has been seen on television and on stage around the world. The double act are known for their comically dark performing style, for taking as inspiration the accounts of Biblical miracles and faking paranormal phenomena to form the basis for some of their illusions.
Biography.
Jones was born on 16 April 1982 in Aberdeen and grew up in Portlethen, Scotland. MacLeod was born in 1980 in the town of Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. MacLeod attended Peterhead Academy before studying philosophy and psychology at Aberdeen University, while Jones grew up in Old Portlethen, before moving to London to study multimedia computing.
They met in Aberdeen in 1994 and started making videos of themselves performing magic. This is where their double act style of acting out scenes in character while performing illusions developed. The filmed results of these magic sketches eventually reached a television production company and led to the making of their first TV series "Magick". The show was nominated as Best Comedy Series at the Rose d'Or international television awards in Montreux in 2004.
In 2005 they hosted the television series "Dirty Tricks" and television special "When Magic Tricks go Wrong" and in 2006 the pair created two one-hour specials for Channel 4, "Tricks from the Bible" and "The Magic of Jesus" where they took inspiration from and duplicated the miracles described in the Old and New Testament.
In 2009, Jones and MacLeod were awarded the 'Best Comedy Illusionist' Award at the World Magic Awards.
They have toured the UK extensively throughout from 2010 with their live shows as well as performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with new shows between 2008 and 2011.
In 2011 and 2012 they were part of both seasons of BBC1's "The Magicians", a live magic show drawing in over 6 million viewers weekly. They most recently made "The Happenings" – four one-hour specials for Watch in which the duo use their magic to fake paranormal events.
Television.
"Magick".
Jones and MacLeod's first television series "Magick" (aka "Sick Ticks" also, "Crack Magick") debuted on 5 October 2003 and was described as "comedy magic featuring surreal characters in bizarre and uncomfortable situations." It began airing in Australia on SBS on 1 February 2007 under the title "Sick Tricks".
This series featured reverse film magic, where the magic was performed backwards and the film later reversed to reveal the backmasking.
In one of a series of 'crimes' caught on CCTV, footage captures two men being caught en flagrante in a public toilet by a police officer. To get out of trouble, one of the men hides the other behind his coat and makes him disappear. In another incident, a man breaks into a car by sticking his hand through a glass window without breaking it.
Secret filming in a supermarket captures MacLeod and Jones magically sabotaging the products by putting dead insects into sealed bottles of mineral water and penetrating razor blades through the foil lids of ready-meals.
In 2004 this four-part series was nominated for a Rose D'Or comedy award in Montreux.
"Dirty Tricks".
"Dirty Tricks" is a six-part series that was hosted by Jones and MacLeod. It was described as "magic meets Natural Born Killers." The show also had regular spots from Pete Firman, Ali Cook and Jonathan Goodwin as well as guest appearances from international variety acts and celebrities including Penn &amp; Teller and Kevin James.
At the end of every show, the presenters "kill" the radio and TV presenter Neil Fox in a horrific and painful manner. This includes him being cremated, stabbed and crushed.
"The Magic of Jesus".
This one-hour special aired over the Christmas holiday period in December 2005. In this show Jones and MacLeod drew inspiration from the accounts of Jesus' miracles in the New Testament to present illusions which included apparently walking on the surface of water in a glass tank, turning water into wine, causing a blind person to temporarily 'see', appearing to raise a deceased person, causing a virgin to apparently become 'pregnant' and feeding 5000 people.
"Tricks from the Bible".
Following on from "The Magic of Jesus" this one-hour special aired in June 2006. The duo drew inspiration from the miracle accounts in the Old Testament. Jones and MacLeod performed illusions such as turning staffs into snakes in Egypt, exactly where it was said to be performed in the Old Testament, casting some of the plagues of Egypt on two fans in an enclosed part of a restaurant, a transformation into a pillar of salt, exorcism of a demon, robbing a man of his strength as Samson had, apparently raising someone from the dead and pulling a coin from the mouth of a fish, performed on a boat in the Red Sea.
"The Magicians".
"The Magicians" is a BBC primetime show, that aired its first series during January 2011. It featured Barry and Stuart alongside host Lenny Henry and fellow magicians Luis de Matos and Chris Korn. The show returned for its second series on 7 January 2012, with Barry and Stuart being the only personalities retained from series one. The second series featured two new magicians alongside Barry and Stuart; American magician Jason Latimer and English magician Pete Firman. This second series was broadcast live and was the first magic series to do so in the UK in 30 years
"The Happenings".
In December 2013 Barry and Stuart's latest show, "The Happenings", a four x 60 min series debuted in the UK on the digital channel Watch HD. The duo went undercover as they set about making the unbelievable paranormal-like events believable to the unsuspecting residents of towns across the UK and America.
Each episode was a self-contained narrative and featured their magic and illusion under the guise of mysterious incidents that were played out over the course of a few weeks in four towns. Episodes featured, ghosts, vampires, aliens and government cover-ups. A number of events filmed for the program made national headlines including their faked ghost sighting and alien landing.
The program was first broadcast internationally in April 2014 on the National Geographic Channel.
Theatre.
In 2008 the duo took their debut live show "Part Time Warlocks" to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Following 5 star reviews and a total sell out run, extra dates of the show were staged in a larger venue. In 2009 they returned to the Edinburgh Fringe with a new show "Powered by Demons" which they later performed at the Soho Theatre, London. Returning to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2010 they performed "98% Séance", a show where they used their magic to fake ghostly apparitions under the guise of a séance. In a five-star review, "Time Out London" described the show as "a triumph of astonishing illusions, inventive technology, and unexpected frights." This show was the most positively tweeted about show at the Edinburgh Fringe 2010 according to the Realtime, crowd-sourced review website, EdTwinge.
They toured the UK in spring 2010 with "Barry and Stuart: Live". In 2011 they performed two shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, "The Show" and "The Tell". In "The Show" they performed an hour of magic, then a limited number of that audience had the chance to buy tickets for "The Tell" where they would witness the explanations to the all tricks they had just witnessed. In 2012 they toured the UK with "Show and Tell", a joint version of the two separate Edinburgh shows, and due to popular demand extended this tour into 2013.
They brought their live show for the first time to audiences in the United States with "Barry and Stuart Live" at Coronet Theatre Los Angeles in April 2013.

Bronson–Mulholland House

The Bronson–Mulholland House, (also known as the Judge Isaac H. Bronson House, Bronson's Point, Sunny Side, and Sunny Point), is an historic site located at 100 Madison Street, in Palatka, Florida. Sunny Point was built in 1854. On December 27, 1972, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
History.
Bronson era: 1852–1860.
Judge Isaac H. Bronson probably first considered moving to Palatka, Florida in 1852 when the "Palatka Tract" of about 1,220 acres was conveyed in trust to him by three prominent Palatka families – the Reids, the Carrs, and the Burts. In May 1855, Isaac and his wife Sophronia re-conveyed the tract to James Burt, excluding their estate known as Sunny Point, lands that had been sold by Bronson, and a number of lots held for Sophronia Bronson.
Through the early deed and mortgage books, it is possible to pinpoint the time the Bronsons built their home in Palatka and took up residence there. The 1850 United States census and Slave Schedule reports Bronson as a resident of St. Johns County. In September 1852 Bronson is referred to as a resident of St. Augustine, Florida, whereas in the following March he is listed as a resident of Palatka. Thus we can assume that in 1853 the Bronsons decided to make Palatka their home, as in that year they also marked off 10 acres of land along the St. Johns River which they named Sunny Point. A mortgage record dated March 3, 1854 notes Sunny point as "Being the point of ground upon which said Bronson is now building and cultivating grounds." Sunny Point was removed from the mortgage on the "Palatka Tract" on October 16, 1854, being lands "set apart by the said Bronson for his own residence, and on which he has lately erected a dwelling house and other buildings." Most likely, the Bronsons spent the winter of 1854 in their new home.
It is assumed that Bronson had cypress cut from lands near the mouth of the Ocklawaha River and brought to Sunny Point by raft. It is known that Bronson was part owner of the Palatka Saw Mill Company, which had a steam saw mill erected by August 1853. The lumber for the 7,199 square foot Bronson home was probably cut by that saw.
The Bronsons and Palatka.
The Bronsons took active roles in the development of their new home town. Judge Bronson prepared and sponsored the city charter for Palatka in the state legislature. He also petitioned that the town be made the county seat of Putnam County, Florida. Additionally, he donated the land for the 
county courthouse, where it still stands today. The Bronsons and their two daughters, Gertrude and Emma, were members of St. Mark's Episcopal Church (Palatka, Florida), of which Isaac Bronson was chairman and one of the first vestrymen.
Isaac and Sophronia entertained in their new home. Among their visitors were William Dunn Moseley, Florida's first state governor, Robert Raymond Reid, another Florida governor, and Benjamin A. Putnam, for whom the county was named. The American Guide Series describes Sunny Point as a public social center in the 1850s.
Isaac Bronson died on August 13, 1855, and was buried in a fifteen square foot plot at the southwest corner of Sunny Point. On his mausoleum were the words "In his death men have lost a friend, Society an upright citizen, and the Church a humble and loving son." When Sophronia Bronson sold the property to Charlotte J. Henry in 1867, the new owner agreed to preserve the burial plot. In 1892 the Bronson daughters, Emma and Gertrude, agreed to return the fifteen square feet of land to the current owners upon the removal of Isaac Bronson's grave. Today, Judge Isaac Bronson's mausoleum rests in Palatka's Oak Hill Cemetery.
In 1854, prior to his passing, Isaac Bronson made George A. Fairbanks a trustee of Sunny Point for Sophronia Bronson. Fairbanks paid $3,000, and the step was taken either to protect Sophronia after the death of her husband, or for financial reasons. After her husband's death, Sophronia Bronson remained at Sunny Point. Deed records dated November 1856 indicate that Mrs. Bronson was in Palatka at that time. Donations made to St. Mark's Church up to April 1860 suggest that she was at Sunny Point until the outbreak of the Civil War. At that time, she probably returned to her home state of New York, although the earliest record of her being there is in June 1866. Sophronia Bronson died in Morristown, New Jersey, in June 1874.
Civil War: 1861–1865.
Sunny Point was vacant during the Civil War. It is believed that, early in the war, Confederate soldiers used the attic of the house as a lookout when Union forces were approaching down the St. John's River. In 1864, Union troops occupied the city of Palatka and utilized Sunny Point as an encampment. The house was also utilized by Union troops as a lookout for Confederate blockade runners.
White Era: 1866–1904.
Charlotte Henry and the Freedman's Union Commission School.
Charlotte Henry (eventually becoming Charlotte White) was originally from New York, and became a close associate with Sophronia Bronson when she returned to New York from Palatka. How connections formed between the two is unknown, but there are several possibilities; one of these being the fact that they were both abolitionists. In any case, an association was formed, and it was instrumental in Charlotte Henry's decision to come to Palatka. According to the records, Miss Henry purchased 300 acres of land located seven miles from Palatka in October 1865. In January 1866 she opened a school in Palatka which was supported by the New York branch of the Freedmen's Bureau. Although there is no record of where the first classes were held, later evidence indicates that Miss Henry's school always met at Sunny Point.
Sunny Point was leased by Sophronia Bronson to the Freedman's Union Commission in November 1866. At that time Charlotte Henry was teaching over 60 African American children. We can assume that she enjoyed her work and was happy at Sunny Point because she made arrangements to buy the property from Mrs. Bronson. Miss Henry paid $6,000 and agreed to honor the lease made to the Freedman's Union Commission.
Charlotte Henry continued her school in Palatka through June 1868. It is believed that she also handed out the provisions sent by the government for the students every Saturday. Unfortunately, the school was closed in 1868. However, the fact that Miss Henry remained in Palatka after the school's closing indicates that she and the townspeople got along well. The most likely reason for the closing of the school was financial. Around the time of the school's closing, the Superintendent of Education Charles H. Foster received a letter from the Freedman's Union Commission informing him that "greatly to their regret they will not be able to continue the work they have hitherto prosecuted in Florida." The entire Freedman's Union Commission was beginning to dissolve, and would do so completely by the next year.
Charlotte and Nathaniel P. White.
In March 1873, Nathaniel P. White took over Miss Henry's mortgage on the other property she owned outside Palatka. The two were probably married by that time, with the wedding taking place in New York. The earliest documented date of Charlotte Henry as Mrs. Nathaniel P. White was in 1874, when the couple was listed as members of St. Mark's Episcopal Church. Nathaniel White was originally from Port Huron, Michigan, so speculation is that he was on vacation in Palatka when he met Miss Henry.
According to the records of St. Mark's church, all White family contributions were made in the winter months. An article in "The Eastern Herald" dated September 25, 1875, stated that "Bronson's point is looking grand and beautiful, but it needs its occupants N.P. White, Esq., and his excellent wife to charm it into life." Likewise, on June 3, 1892, The Palatka Weekly Times noted that N.P. White was leaving for Pennsylvania, having spent the previous two summers in New Hampshire and Michigan. This leads one to believe that Sunny Point had become a summer home for the Whites.
Nathaniel White died in Port Huron in December 1895, leaving Charlotte as the sole heir of his real and personal property both in Michigan and Florida. Where and how Mrs. White spent her time after the death of her husband is unknown, but she probably spent much of it at Sunny Point. In 1899 her name appears as a member of the St. Mark's Church, and she died in Palatka in January 1904 at the age of 82. She is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Palatka – the same cemetery that contains Judge Isaac Bronson's mausoleum.
Mulholland era: 1904–1945.
Mary Mulholland was born in 1842. According to Edelmira Rivero, who later lived with her for several years, Miss Mulholland took nursing training at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. She then went on with her studies, stopping three months short of becoming a medical doctor. It was in Boston that she met Charlotte White, but in what year is unknown.
The most likely reason for Mary Mulholland's arrival at Sunny Point was that she spent her vacations with the Whites and stayed on to help care for Nathaniel White when he became ill. After his death in 1895, she remained with Charlotte at Sunny Point.
In January 1904, a few days before her death, Charlotte White conveyed Sunny Point to Mary Mulholland. The property at the time included almost the same land that Sophronia Bronson had sold her in 1867. However, Miss Mulholland was unable to keep the estate intact. In 1914 she began selling lots for residential purposes and by 1936 at least seven other homes stood on what was once part of Sunny Point. Miss Mulholland also borrowed over $7,500 between 1917 and 1935 which, according to Edelmira Rivero, was used to pay property taxes. Miss Rivero notes that Miss Mulholland "sacrificed so much to hold what she could," and did her best to keep the place beautiful. She had stone posts erected at each entrance way, in which the words "Mulholland Park" were cut. The land was beautifully landscaped and along the river were weeping willows and oleanders.
Mary Mulholland did not nurse professionally after the death of Mrs. White, probably because she was in her sixties by that time. Miss Rivero recalled that Miss Mulholland would go "quietly among the poor and used her knowledge and skill to help them; she never refused a call from them." After the outbreak of World War I, Miss Mulholland became active in the Putnam Country Red Cross Chapter, serving as Vice Chairman in 1917 when the chapter was first organized. She allowed the Red Cross to use the east wing of her home as a work room, and she herself made service calls to the homes of soldiers.
On October 4, 1935, Mary Mulholland died in Palatka and is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery, along with Judge Isaac Bronson and Charlotte White. Upon her death, Mary Mulholland's possession of Sunny Point passed on to Edelmira Rivero, stating she ""...lived with me in my home in Palatka, from the time that she was a little girl until she was a young lady, and has been a great help and assistance to me and has done me many acts of kindness"."
Edelmira Rivero and Sunny Point.
Edelmira Rivero was born in Cuba during the Spanish–American War. Her parents died by the time she was three or four, leaving her and her sister Taurina (about five years older) orphaned. Eventually, they found their way into a Florida orphanage after a pair of visiting Episcopalian nuns found them living without parents. They remained at the orphanage until Edelmira was ten or eleven, and Taurina was fifteen. Taurina described her sister as a beautiful young girl with auburn hair, and says she was often taken around to various locations and used as an example of the types of wards the orphanage cared for. However, Taurina described the living conditions at the orphanage as unpleasant, and they eventually ran away. It is not told how they came to Palatka, but shortly thereafter, Mary Mulholland employed Taurina as a housekeeper. Apparently Miss Mulholland had a reasonably good but fiery relationship with Taurina. She also became very fond of Edelmira and wished to adopt her, but Taurina would not allow it.
When Taurina married at 18 in 1907, she told her younger sister that she could either come live with her or stay with Miss Mulholland. Miss Mulholland promised Taurina that Edelmira would be well cared for and given a college education if she was allowed to stay. We know now that Edelmira elected to stay and Miss Mulholland was true to her word. Throughout her life, Taurina often visited the two at Sunny Point.
When Miss Mulholland died in 1935, Miss Rivero had become a teacher in Jacksonville, Florida. Unable to live in Palatka, she had the shutters of Sunny Point bolted, and eventually moved the furniture – much of which was in the house when the Whites had lived there – to Jacksonville. At the same time, she gave permission to the Red Cross Chapter to continue meeting in the house. The chapter met in the west wing and continued their service activities through World War II.
Edelmira Rivero owned the house for ten years. Like Miss Mulholland, she found it necessary to sell land once part of Sunny Point as residential lots. In 1945 Edelmira felt that she could no longer keep Sunny Point. Later in her life, she wrote the following:
I loved the beautiful house in which I had grown up, and wanted to keep it. I held on for ten years. During World War II I let the Red Cross make their headquarters there. The roof leaked, I had a new roof put on and it still leaked. I was teaching in high school in Jacksonville and couldn't be in Palatka. I had seen how Miss Mulholland had struggled through the years to hold the property. Doing without things herself and borrowing to pay the high taxes. I realized I couldn't afford to hold on to it, so I sold it.
The lot which Edelmira Rivero sold in 1945 has the same boundaries as the lot we see today. She continued to live and teach in Jacksonville until her death in 1974. She was buried next to Mary Mulholland in Oak Hill Cemetery – along with other former residents of Sunny Point.
Postwar era: 1945–1977.
In 1945, Sunny Point (now called Mulholland Park) was briefly owned by the Reverend and Mrs. J.C. Yelton. They sold the house in 1946 to Laura and E.C. Hindman, who took out three different mortgages on the property – in 1946, 1948, and 1951. It is probable that the Hindmans divided the house into apartments and walled in the east porches immediately after they purchased it. An article in the "Palatka Daily News" in November 1946 noted that "Mr. and Mrs. B.M. Jones have moved to the Hindman Apartments in Mulholland Park." In 1955, the Hindmans sold the house to Grace and James Jones, their daughter and son-in-law. The city directory of 1956 listed nine apartments at the same address as the house. Interviews with a couple that resided in the house in the 1950s reported it to have between 8 and 14 apartments. In May 1956 it was sold yet again to a Key David McMurrain, who promised to keep the property in repair and insured against fire. In 1962, the house was transferred to McMurrain's ward William. The 1960 and 1964 directories refer to the house as the Mulholland Apartments. Finally, in January 1965, William McMurrain sold the property to the City of Palatka, which brought the apartment period to an end. It was then that interest began in restoring the house to its original splendor, as by that time the house had fallen into severe disrepair. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, the Bronson–Mulholland house was open to visitors in 1977.
Restoration era: 1977–present.
Many efforts have been made over the years to appropriately restore the Bronson–Mulholland house to its original splendor. While the City of Palatka owns the structure and the surrounding land, the Putnam County Historical Society in partnership maintains all of the interior furnishings. Due to the nature of the history of the house, very little of its original furnishings remain. Most of the pieces are antiques from the mid to late 1800s – and many are generous donations or loans from local families. There are, however, some pieces on loan from the family of Edelmira Rivero that are original to the home, and are from when the Whites occupied it.
Today, the house serves as both a historical resource and an event venue. Every year at the end of September, Civil War re-enactors gather on the green in front of the house to recreate the Union Occupation of Palatka in 1864. Recent efforts have been made to restore the home to its status as a major wedding venue in Northeast Florida.
Future plans.
The City of Palatka hopes to revitalize interest in the house by marketing it once again as a wedding and event venue, as well as a vital cultural and historical resource for Floridians. A monthly newsletter as well as a Facebook page have been launched, along with an active website. The home is frequently open for tours, and regular historical lectures open to the public are held in the front parlor.
Currently the home is undergoing renovations with most of the work being focused on the first floor porch which has been removed due to damaged and worn wood. The home is at current surrounded by a construction fence, but the home and museum next door are both regularly open to the public. At the current time there is no official continuation or completion date for the restoration work under way.

Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services

Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services was a bus company based in Maidstone, Kent. The company operated bus and coach services in Mid and West Kent and East Sussex from 1911 until 1998. The company's surviving operations were absorbed into Arriva Southern Counties.
History.
Early years.
In 1908 a hired Darracq-Serpollet steam bus made a trial run from London to Maidstone. A public service commenced a week later between Maidstone and Chatham. In July, a further service was introduced between north Maidstone and the Athletic Ground via Maidstone West railway station. The venture was not entirely successful, and an increase in fares was not enough to prevent the vehicles being re-possessed. In 1910, the undertaking was purchased by Walter Flexman French, who named the company the "Maidstone, Chatham, Gravesend &amp; District Motor Omnibus Service". It was registered as Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services Limited in March 1911.
British Electric Traction acquired part of M&amp;D in 1913. A year later, new routes were introduced from Maidstone to Ashford, Faversham, Hastings, Sevenoaks and Tenterden, and between Chatham and Faversham. By 1917. fourteen services were in operation using letters for identification. A later expansion of services resulted in letters being replaced by numbers.
Tilling Group acquired an interest in the company in 1921, while Maidstone &amp; District became a public company in 1922. M&amp;D opened the first bus station in England, sited in Palace Avenue, Maidstone in 1922. In 1929, M&amp;D acquired the Chatham &amp; District Traction Company, but retained the Chatham &amp; District fleetname as a separate operation until 1955.
The advent of the Road Traffic Act 1930 saw the demise of a number of independents, many of which were acquired by M&amp;D. The formation of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933 required M&amp;D to surrender most its operations in Dartford and Gravesend, together with garages in Dartford and Northfleet. M&amp;D acquired Autocar Services in 1928, keeping it as a separate company until the purchase of its rival, Redcar Services in 1935.
In 1935, M&amp;D took over the Hastings Tramways Company, which brought trolleybuses into the fleet. The Hastings Tramway fleetname was retained for the Hastings trolleybus system until 1957. During the Second World War Gillingham depot was destroyed in a bombing raid in August 1940.
Post war.
As the 1950s drew to a close, the Hastings Tramways fleetname disappeared, the M&amp;D fleetname appearing on vehicles from 1957. M&amp;D made a decision to abandon the trolleybus system and ordered some of the country's first Leyland Atlanteans to facilitate this and continued to buy the type as replacement for earlier smaller capacity double deck vehicles.
M&amp;D also purchased a number of single-deckers for one-person operation of rural services, initial examples being based on the Albion Nimbus chassis. AEC Reliances were purchased until the mid-1960s, when several batches of Leyland Panthers were ordered. At the same time, the Daimler Fleetline with lowheight Northern Counties bodywork succeeded the Leyland Atlantean as the standard double deck intake.
National Bus Company.
Maidstone &amp; District became part of the National Bus Company (NBC) on 1 January 1969. The company purchased several batches of Leyland Leopards for both bus and coach work. An unusual order was for a fleet of 30 two-door Marshall single deck vehicles based on Daimler Fleetline 33 ft. chassis for one person operation in the Medway Towns. In 1972 these were exchanged with similar age double deckers Fleetlines from Northern General Transport. NBC introduced standard liveries in 1972 and the traditional dark green and cream livery gave way to NBC leaf green.
The company made its first loss in 1971, necessitating some rationalisation. To reduce overhead costs, NBC decided to have a single senior management team and amalgamated finance and purchasing functions for M&amp;D and the adjacent company East Kent Road Car Company with the control of the company transferred to the Canterbury office.
In 1973, some services were transferred between East Kent and M&amp;D, with M&amp;D gaining operations in Faversham and Rye and reducing services in Ashford and closing its depot. In 1974. services were renumbered in a common sequence with those of East Kent Road Car Company. Services were re-numbered according to area with most services receiving three digit numbers, the first of which indicated the area of operation.
Vehicle purchases now followed NBC practice with Eastern Coach Works bodied Bristol VRTs and several batches of Leyland Nationals including some dual purpose buses for a proposed network of limited stop services. In 1975, as part of a trial for NBC, trial batches of the MCW Metropolitan, Volvo Ailsa B55 and Bristol VRT series 3 entered service at Silverhill, eventually transferring to the Medway Towns. M&amp;D went on to buy large numbers of Bristol VRTs, although it also took two batches of MCW Metrobuses.
Services in Chatham began to serve the new Pentagon Bus Station in 1976, while Lower Stone Street Bus Station in Maidstone was redeveloped using NBC's standard layout. This enabled the closure of the original bus station in Palace Avenue, although the booking office building was purchased by the Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway and re-assembled at Tenterden Town railway station.
Gravesend area services were recast as part of a co-ordination scheme with London Country Bus Services. London Country took over a number of town services from M&amp;D, and M&amp;D's Gravesend Depot closed 18 months later, the remaining local services passing to London Country's Northfleet depot.
1979 saw the replacement of the former Green Line 719 service between London and Wrotham and the Maidstone - Tenterden extension of National Express 008 with a limited stop service 919. It was initially operated with dual purpose Leyland Nationals. Between Wrotham and Farningham, the service called at most bus stops, taking over three hours end to end. Despite the subsequent introduction of coach specification vehicles, the service was not a success.
In the early 1980s, expectations of a complete merger with East Kent began to grow. Vehicles and operations were interchanged, including some M&amp;D Atlanteans, which were swapped for AEC Regents. In 1980, the first Market Analysis Project was completed in the Hastings area, leading to the adoption of the "Hastings &amp; District" name for buses operating from Silverhill, Hastings and Hawkhurst depots. Services were cut and Bexhill depot was closed in April 1980. A group of former M&amp;D drivers formed Bexhill Town Bus Services, initially operating a number elderly Leyland Nationals acquired from Plymouth Citybus.
The Hastings &amp; District operation became a separate company in 1983, although Hawkhurst depot remained with M&amp;D while Rye passed to the new company. Hastings &amp; District was eventually purchased by Stagecoach, who combined it with parts of Southdown Motor Services company to form South Coast Buses.
The 1980s saw a number of depot closures, notably the Maidstone depot in Knightrider Street (following co-ordination of local services with Maidstone Borough Council Transport under the Maidstone Area Bus Services banner) and the relatively new facility at Tonbridge. The company's Central Works in Maidstone also closed, maintenance being devolved to a new company Kent Engineering (based in Canterbury and Hawkhurst), who also undertook maintenance for East Kent.
The express coach services between London, the Medway Towns and Maidstone were re-branded Invictaway in the early 1980s, this name also being applied to route 900 between Gillingham and Gatwick Airport. An all-over black livery was used. To enhance these services, several batches of Leyland Olympians with ECW double deck coach bodies were acquired and painted in a green and white livery. This was later applied to the whole Invictaway fleet.
Privatisation.
On 7 November 1986, M&amp;D was sold in a management buyout. NBC's standard green livery was retained, although the white relief was later changed to cream. M&amp;D took a cautious approach to deregulation, mainly registering inter-urban routes which followed major roads. Casualties included the routes serving North Downs villages south of Sittingbourne and Faversham together with the majority of Sunday services. There were also some improvements, including increased frequency on the trunk 70-74 group of services westwards along the London Road from Maidstone together with improvements local services in the Medway Towns.
In 1986, the first of 90 Mercedes-Benz vehicles were acquired for service in Tunbridge Wells and Chatham. M&amp;D purchased Northern Counties Palatine bodied Leyland Olympians in significant numbers post-privatisation. Joint operation of services with East Kent Road Car Company ended with deregulation in August 1986. The long-established route 10 between Maidstone with Ashford and Folkestone was split in two at Ashford, with M&amp;D no longer operating on the route.
M&amp;D initially avoided confrontation with council-owned Boro'line Maidstone. Buses continued to be garaged in Boro'line's depot in Armstrong Road. In 1991 Boro'line was put up for sale, so M&amp;D decided to register a number of town services in direct competition. In 1992 it was sold to Maidstone &amp; District. M&amp;D moved into Boro'line's depot, which at one point became the head office of M&amp;D, Kentish Bus and Londonlinks. Most of Boro'line's fleet was disposed of, with the exception of one former Maidstone Corporation Massey Brothers bodied Leyland PD2 which passed into M&amp;D's heritage fleet and is now privately owned.
In 1993, M&amp;D was the subject of a Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission inquiry, that found that it had engaged in a bus war.
The end of M&amp;D.
M&amp;D was acquired by British Bus, who also owned the neighbouring Kentish Bus operation, on 13 April 1995. The Invictaway services were re-branded as Green Line. Vehicle replacements saw Bristol VRTs replaced by Olympians. In 1996, the Cowie Group acquired British Bus. A new livery, designed by Ray Stenning and based on M&amp;D's traditional green and cream including a stylised scroll fleetname, was introduced. It first appeared on a batch of Plaxton Pointer-bodied Dennis Dart SLFs, many of which were acquired under a Quality Partnership scheme with Kent County Council for three routes in Maidstone.
The application of the new livery across the fleet was curtailed by the decision of the recently renamed Arriva group to introduced a corporate livery and rename its subsidiaries. In April 1998, the company became Arriva Kent &amp; Sussex, which is now part of Arriva Southern Counties.
In April 2013 Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services Ltd., by then listed as a dormant company, was acquired by a small Norfolk operator, Dogwood Coaches, the owner of which originates from the Medway Towns. There are plans to reintroduce bus services in Kent under the M&amp;D banner, in association with a local operator.

Sierra Leone national cricket team

The Sierra Leone national cricket team is the men's team that represents Sierra Leone in international cricket. They became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2002 and an associate member in 2017.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Sierra Leone and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have the T20I status.
History.
The history of cricket in Sierra Leone dates back to the Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate when it was introduced by the British. In 1887, a Sierra Leone team played a two-day match against a team from the West India Regiments. International cricket dates from the 1930s when Sierra Leone began to play Gambia. In 1967 the West African Championships were created with former British colonies Nigeria and Ghana also sending teams. Starting in 1991, the Sierra Leone Civil War caused a decline in cricketing activity, with the country's main ground Kingtom Oval used as a refugee camp.
Sierra Leone was a member of the West Africa Cricket Council which became a member of the ICC in 1976 and fielded the West Africa cricket team, before being dissolved in 2003. The Sierra Leone Cricket Association became an affiliate member of the ICC in its own right in 2002 and made its debut at an ICC tournament at the 2004 African Affiliates Championship, where they finished last out of the eight teams. They returned at the equivalent tournament in 2006, Division Three of the African region of the World Cricket League, where they showed major improvement, this time finishing as runners-up to Mozambique, and only just missing out on promotion to Division Two.
T20I status (2019-present).
Sierra Leone gained T20I status in 2019 and played their first match against Nigeria in 2021, securing a narrow win.
In 2021 Sierra Leone was among five teams excluded from the ICC T20I Championship for failing to play enough fixtures in the relevant period, an effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.

HMQS Mosquito

HMQS "Mosquito" was a torpedo boat operated by the Queensland Maritime Defence Force and Commonwealth Naval Forces. She entered service in 1885 and after Federation was transferred to the Commonwealth Naval Forces, serving as a training vessel until she was paid off in 1910.
Construction and design.
Following the Jervois-Scratchley reports the colonial governments of Australia restructured their defence forces. One of the outcomes of the report was the formation of the Queensland Maritime Defence Force. To equip the new force two gunboats and a torpedo boat were initially purchased.
Constructed by Thornycroft of Chiswick, HMQS "Mosquito" was launched on 16 July 1884, having been before being completed in 1885. With a galvanised steel hull, she was designed with a top speed of 21 knots; however, was only able to achieve 17.21 knots during trials. The ship was built to a standard design; "TB 191" of Tasmania and the New Zealand "Defender"-class torpedo boats were identical. "Lonsdale" and "Nepean" of Victoria, built in 1883–1884, were also identical, except in mounting fixed torpedo tubes. Displacing 12 tons, she was long, and had a beam. She had a complement of seven and was equipped with two sets of dropping gear for 14-inch torpedoes. Construction cost 3,500 pounds sterling.
Service history.
"Mosquito" was subsequently transported to Australia as deck cargo by an East India Company steamer. She was subsequently based at facilities constructed at the bottom of the cliffs of the western side of Kangaroo Point, on the Brisbane River. She was never commissioned but simply placed into service when required, as she had no crew accommodation facilities, and therefore spent much of her time out of the water. Following Federation in 1901, "Mosquito" was transferred to the new Commonwealth Naval Forces and was employed as a training vessel until she was paid off in 1910. Her fittings and engines were removed before being abandoned in Boggy Creek near Pinkenba. Parts of her hull were discovered in January 1966 and an archaeological survey of the remains was conducted in 2009; the stern casemate was recovered and is in the collection of the Queensland Museum.

JEA

JEA, located in Jacksonville, Florida, is the eighth-largest community-owned electric utility company in the United States and the largest in Florida. As of 2022, JEA served more than 1 million Northeast Florida residents with electric, water, sewer and reclaimed water services. JEA also provides some customers with methane gas sales, and access to dark fiber. In addition, JEA works with the City of Jacksonville to maintain its streetlight system. Besides Jacksonville (Duval County), JEA also serves customers in Clay, Nassau and St. Johns counties.
History.
Jacksonville's water and sewer systems have been operated by the city since 1880.
City of Jacksonville Electric Department.
In 1895, the first electric power station, Main Street Power Plant came online, providing night-time lighting for the first time to downtown.
In 1943, the Baldwin Interconnector came online, providing backup power to nearby Naval Air Station Jacksonville and Camp Blanding.
In 1950, the Southside Generating Station came online, and is hooked up to the city's electric grid.
On September 9, 1964, Hurricane Dora devastated 95 percent of the city's electric grid.
JEA History.
On August 8, 1967, as part of the consolidation of the City of Jacksonville and Duval County governments, the City of Jacksonville Electric Department became an independent body, renamed Jacksonville Electric Authority, operating in accordance with Article 21 of the Jacksonville Code of Ordinance.
According to Article 21 of the Jacksonville City Charter,
"JEA is authorized to own, manage and operate a utilities system within and outside the City of Jacksonville. JEA is created for the express purpose of acquiring, constructing, operating, financing and otherwise have plenary authority with respect to electric, water, sewer, natural gas and such other utility systems as may be under its control now or in the future."
During the 1970s, JEAs electric rates were among the highest in the nation. Royce Lyles became JEA Managing Director on September 1, 1979 and the utility began diversifying its fuel mix. Rates began to drop, eventually becoming the lowest in the state and near the bottom in the Southeast.
Walt Bussells was appointed Managing Director on September 8, 1995, following Royce Lyles' retirement.
On June 1, 1997, Jacksonville's Department of Public Utilities, water and sewer operations merged into the Jacksonville Electric Authority. The utility subsequently became known as JEA as it provided a broader range of services beyond electric service.
Bussells embraced new technology and in 2002, JEA introduced online bill payment and implemented network meter reading. In 2003, JEA’s first chilled water facility became fully operational and began providing chilled water for air conditioning in downtown buildings. Since then, JEA has completed three additional facilities and has contracts to provide sixteen (16) locations with chilled water. Chilled water clients include Vystar Veterans Arena, 121 Financial Ballpark, Downtown Public Library, State Attorney Office, Duval County Courthouse and UF Health Hospital Campus, among others. 
During Bussells's tenure, Jacksonville's electric rates had remained artificially low throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, despite large expenditures following the water/sewer acquisition in 1997, technology improvements, and construction of chilled water equipment. These projects were financed with borrowed money.
Jim Dickenson replaced Walt Bussells when Bussells retired on June 15, 2004 after nine years as CEO. Soon after taking over, Dickenson implemented the first of three temporary fuel rate increases to offset rising fuel costs. In 2007, JEA had the second-lowest electric rates in Florida before they announced a four-year base rate increase package that would raise the average bill from $112 to more than $140 in 2010. The additional revenue was designed to reduce debt.
The utility's debt in 2010 was $6.0 billion, against assets of $7.5 billion. Compared to other similar sized municipal utilities, JEA had 60% more debt per customer, which could lower the utility's bond rating and make it more expensive and difficult to borrow money.
In early 2012, Dickenson announced that he would retire February 1, 2013. On September 7, 2012 JEA Board of Directors named Paul McElroy to fill the role of JEA CEO and Managing Director effective October 1, 2012.
In October 2012, Paul McElroy signed a 3-year contract to serve as JEA's CEO and this contract has been extended once; it ends in September 2018.
Aaron Zahn served as CEO from April 2018 until his termination on Jan. 28, 2020.
COO Melissa Dykes was elevated to Managing Director &amp; CEO on an interim basis until May 5, 2020, when Paul McElroy returned to lead JEA until a permanent replacement was selected. In June 2020, McElroy placed the majority of the leadership team that served under Zahn on paid administrative leave and appointed interim leaders.
Jay Stowe was named Managing Director &amp; CEO in November 2020. Stowe’s new seven-member leadership team was in place by September 2021.
The decision was made to leave the 19-story JEA tower and customer center, built in 1963, due to rising cost of repairs and maintenance. Renovation was rejected as too expensive and there was inadequate parking available. 
JEA needed less than half the space of the Downtown Center, so it consolidated operations in a leased, seven-story glass front building at 225 N. Pearl Street in April 2023.
JEA provides vouchers for customer parking at the Duval County Courthouse Garage across the street.
Following Stowe's resignation in April 2024, JEA veteran Vickie Cavey was named Interim Managing Director &amp; CEO, and she was elevated to the permanent role in September 2024. After a successful year in the position, her salary was elevated from $560,000 to $700,000 annually.
In February 2025, the company announced that they were accepting bids for redevelopment of the vacant buildings at their former headquarters.
Attempted sale and aftermath.
In early 2018, JEA's board of directors became interested in potentially selling the publicly owned JEA.
In late December 2019, a state investigation of JEA's CEO and board of directors launched in response to complaints to the previously mentioned selling of JEA. The State Attorney's Office turned over its investigation to the U.S. Attorney and the FBI, resulting in a federal grand jury indicting former CEO Zahn and former CFO Ryan Wannemacher on charges of conspiracy and wire fraud in 2022. Following a trial, Zahn was found guilty of both charges in March 2024 and sentenced to four years in prison, while Wannemacher was found not guilty on both counts.

Sandek

A sandek or sandak ( "companion of child", from ) is a person honored at a brit milah in Judaism, traditionally either by holding the baby boy on the knees or thighs when the mohel performs the circumcision or by handing the baby to the mohel. 
In Modern Hebrew, "sandak" is also the word for godfather; the film The Godfather is known in Hebrew as "HaSandak". The role is distinct from that of the "kvater", a Yiddish term for the person who carries the baby in Ashkenazi ceremonies.
Etymology.
The origin of the term has been attributed to a derivation from the Greek "sunteknos" ("syn-", meaning "plus", and "tekno", meaning "child"), which means "companion of child". Alternatively, it may be derived from Greek σύνδικος (Latin, "syndicus"), in the sense of "representative," "patron," "advocate."
History.
A number of references in midrashim and other early rabbinical works testify to the existence of the sandek in the Talmudic age. In medieval rabbinical literature the references to the office are numerous, and it appears to have been well established and highly esteemed. Thus the "Haggahot Maimuniyyot" mentions that many "covet and eagerly desire to hold the child upon their knees as it is circumcised."
In medieval times the "sandek" was known by many other names as well, including "ba'al berit" (master of the covenant), "ba'al berit ha-milah" (master of the covenant of circumcision), "tofes ha-yeled" (holder of the child), "av sheni" (second father), and "shaliach" (messenger). The office was surrounded with marks of honor. A special seat, usually richly decorated, was prepared in the synagogue for the sandik, and if the circumcision happened on a day of Torah reading, he was entitled to receive an aliyah. The privilege was reserved for persons of standing and of good moral and religious character. It was restricted also in other ways. Rabbinical authorities (for instance, Rabbenu Peretz and Judah the Hasid) decreed that the privilege should not be given more than once to the same man in the same family, neither should it, unless unavoidable, be given to women. This latter prohibition was based on motives of delicacy. Women were, however, permitted to participate indirectly in the privilege as associates to the sandek. They carried the child to the entrance of the synagogue or to the room in which the circumcision was about to take place, where it was taken by the sandek.
Customs.
Moses Isserles (d. 1572) recorded the practice of the sandek holding the baby on his thighs. The Vilna Gaon cites Midrash Tehillim, explaining that this is based on , which states, "All my bones shall say: 'YHWH, who is like you?'"; the midrash outlines how every body part is used in the service of God, and says that the sandek's thighs participate in the service of God by placing the baby on them during the brit.
The Rema records a custom that a father should not honor the same individual twice by being the sandek for his children. The reason is that the sandek is compared to a kohen (priest) offering the incense offering in the Temple in Jerusalem. The procedure regarding the incense is that a kohen does not perform this mitzva more than once in his lifetime: as God is presumed to reward with wealth the kohen who offers the incense, as many kohanim as possible are allowed to become wealthy. Similarly, the opportunity is afforded to as many people as possible to serve as a sandek and receive God's blessing to become wealthy.
The Vilna Gaon expresses some skepticism regarding this custom. First, based on its reasoning, the custom should have been that one should not serve more than once as a sandek for any child, not just two children of one family. Second, the Vilna Gaon writes that no one has become wealthy because he served as a sandek. Nevertheless, the "Aruch HaShulchan" concludes that the custom recorded by Isserlies should be observed. The Aruch Hashulchan notes, though, that the custom in many locales is that the "rav" (rabbi) of the city serves as the sandek for all the baby boys. The Aruch Hashulchan justifies this practice by comparing the local rav to the High Priest of Israel, who had the right to offer a korban (sacrifice) or incense any time he desired. Indeed, it is related that Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz served as the sandek for innumerable baby boys. Yissocher Frand relates that Yaakov Yitzchak Ruderman, rosh yeshiva (dean) of Yeshivas Ner Yisroel, also served as the sandek for countless baby boys.
The honor was given traditionally to one Jewish male: some older family member (grandfather, great-grandfather), a rabbi, or another important male who was observant and righteous. The sandek also wore the tallit (prayer shawl) and held the baby on a pillow while the mohel completed the circumcision. In modern times, a sandek may be female or even non-Jewish. At most ceremonies, there is only a single sandek, but two are permissible, although more than two is uncommon. 
During the brit, a chair is sometimes placed next to the sandek's seat. The chair is reserved for the prophet Elijah, and remains unoccupied during the ceremony; this practice is derived from the tradition that Elijah protects children from danger. According to some sources, the sandek is the "representative" of Elijah.

Kwok Ka Ming

Kwok Ka Ming (, born 30 October 1949) is a former Hong Kong professional footballer and football coach.
Early life.
Kwok graduated from St. Francis Xavier's College, Tai Kok Tsui where he played in the school basketball and table tennis team. He joined the Hong Kong Football Association junior training course in 1965. Kwok joined Hong Kong First Division League club Rangers at the age of 18. He played on the right side of midfield for both Rangers and Hong Kong in the 1970s. He retired from playing in 1980 when he was just 30 years old. He took part in three Asian Cup qualifiers (1972, 1976 &amp; 1980) and two World Cup qualifiers (1974 &amp; 1978).
Kwok was awarded the "10 Outstanding Youths of Hong Kong" award in 1977 for his contribution to Hong Kong football after helping Hong Kong reach the final round of World Cup qualifiers, along with Hong Kong movie director Michael Hui.
1985 match against China PR.
Kwok later became the coach of the Hong Kong football team, guiding the team to a decisive victory against China PR by 2–1 at the Workers Stadium in Beijing, China on 19 May 1985, during a 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifying game.
Although the two teams drew 0–0 in their first match in Hong Kong, China PR was considered to be stronger and was favoured to win the group. Due to superior goal difference, China only needed a draw to proceed to the next round. However, a 20-yard freekick by Hong Kong's Cheung Chi Tak (張志德) opened the scoring. China PR replied with Li Hui (李輝)'s goal but another well-taken goal by Ku Kam Fai (顧錦輝) sealed the win for Hong Kong and sent China PR out of the 1986 World Cup.
The loss to Hong Kong delayed China PR's World Cup entry for another 16 years before they finally appeared in 2002 Fifa World Cup. After the game, Chinese fans rioted outside the stadium, while the Hong Kong team received a heroic welcome at the Kai Tak Airport.
The victory was passionately remembered by Hong Kong football fans as "The 5.19 Victory".
1986 FIFA World Cup Asia Qualifying Playoffs.
Hong Kong thus earned the right to play Japan for two home-and-away ties in the second qualifying round. Kwok led the team to Kobe where they lost the first leg 3–0.
The return leg at the Hong Kong Stadium was a complete sell-out but the home side lost 2–1 after missing a penalty and several other chances. 
Japan went through 5–1 on aggregate but then went down 3–1 on aggregate to South Korea in the final round and missed the chance to qualify for the finals in Mexico in the following June.
Other tournaments.
Kwok has been, for many different tournaments, including the 2006 FIFA World Cup and 2014 FIFA World Cup, a member of The FIFA Technical Study Group.
Honours.
Kwok was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1978 Birthday Honours "for services to Sport in Hong Kong."

Gutman's Cave

Gutman's Cave () is the widest and highest cave in the Baltic countries, located by the Gauja River in the area known as the in the Gauja National Park near Sigulda, Latvia. It started forming more than 10,000 years ago when meltwater eroded the sandstone rock after the Ice Age. It is the oldest tourist attraction in Latvia. On the walls of the cave are inscriptions from the 17th century. The legend of the Rose of Turaida began in this cave.
Description.
Gutman's Cave is the widest and highest cave in the Baltics. It is 18.8 meters deep, 12 meters wide and 10 meters high. The cave was formed from the yellow-brown sandstone rock of the Gauja river bank; its formation is due to a millennium long interaction between the river and an underground spring.
The cave is considered the oldest tourist attraction in Latvia because visitors, from even the earliest days, have left “decorations” such as names, initials and the dates of their visits engraved on the walls of the cave. Inside the cave are coats-of-arms and the names of various barons and estate owners. These were made to order for a fee by local craftsmen who would wait for wealthy visitors near the cave armed with tools, stepladders and templates. Writing on the cave walls is no longer permitted as the site is a protected archeological and geological monument.
Gutman's Cave is a place of ancient worship. Until the 19th century, people would come to make their offerings to the deities.
Story of Rose of Turaida.
The legend states that in the spring of 1601 during the Polish–Swedish wars, the Swedish army occupied Turaida Castle. After the battle the record keeper of the castle, named Greif, found a little girl just a few weeks old among the dead bodies. He took her in and raised her as his daughter. It happened to be the month of May so he named her Maija/May. As the years went by the little girl grew to be a beautiful young maiden and because of her beauty she was called the Rose of Turaida. Her fiancé, Victor Hail, was a gardener at Sigulda Castle on the opposite side of the Gauja river and in the evenings they would meet at Gutman's Cave.
A Polish deserter, Jakubovsky, lusted after Maija and wanted her to marry him, but the girl turned down his proposal. This angered Jakubovksy and he decided to take her by force. He sent his fellow deserter Skudritis to her with a fake message from Victor telling her to come to the usual meeting place but at a different time. When the girl arrived and realized that she was trapped, she chose to die instead of be shamed. At that time people believed in the power of magic. Maija had a red silk scarf around her neck, a gift from Victor. She offered this scarf, which, she said, bore magic powers and was impossible to cut through, in exchange for letting her go. She encouraged Jacubovky to test the powers of the scarf and use his sword to see if she was telling the truth. Initially Jakubovsky hesitated, but then cut with full force only to see the girl collapse. Jakubovky, fearing punishment for his deed, ran off to the woods and hanged himself. Later that night Victor found his love murdered in the cave and ran to Turaida for help. In the rush he lost his axe at the scene and was eventually accused of murder and sentenced to death. However, the course of events was changed by Skudritis who had followed Jakubovsky and had seen what happened. He told the court what he witnessed and Victor was acquitted. The girl was buried in the cemetery by Turaida church where you may visit her final resting place. For a very long time this story was thought to be a sad legend, but in the middle of the 19th century the court archives in Vidzeme revealed the transcript of the murder case of Maija in the Gutman's Cave dated August 1620. This ancient legend has led many artists to create works in praise of the devotion of The Rose of Turaida and the power of love.
Right next to Gutman's Cave is the smaller Victor's Cave. The story goes that Victor Hail hacked out this cave for his fiancée, the Rose of Turaida, so she could watch him at work in the gardens of Sigulda Castle.
The story of Maija and Victor is similar to that of "Romeo and Juliet", and for this reason Sigulda is sometimes known as the "City of Love".

Arthur P. Jacobs

Arthur P. Jacobs (March 7, 1922 – June 27, 1973) was an American film producer. Prior to being a producer, he worked in various studios and was a press agent. Beginning in 1963 until his death, he was responsible for film productions such as the "Planet of the Apes" series, "Doctor Dolittle", "Goodbye, Mr. Chips", "Play It Again, Sam" and "Tom Sawyer" through his company APJAC Productions.
Early life.
Arthur P. Jacobs was born to a Jewish family in Los Angeles. He lost his father in a car accident in 1940 and his mother to cancer in 1959. Jacobs majored in cinema at the University of Southern California in 1942. Starting as a courier at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1943, he was promoted to their publicity department before being lured to Warner Bros. as a publicist in 1946. In 1947, he left Warners to open his own public relations office, and in 1956 he formed "The Arthur P. Jacobs Co., Inc." Among his clients were Gregory Peck, James Stewart, Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe.
Career.
In 1963, Jacobs formed the feature film production company APJAC Productions, which released its first film, "What a Way to Go!" through 20th Century-Fox the following year. Jacobs had been able to secure financing for the project on the strength of Fox contract star Monroe's agreement to star in it, but her death in 1962 forced Jacobs to replace her with Shirley MacLaine. "What a Way to Go!" became one of Fox's highest-grossing releases of 1964, earning Jacobs enough credibility for the studio to finance "Doctor Dolittle", ultimately a much-maligned movie that failed both critically and commercially upon its release in 1967. "Planet of the Apes", however, became a box office hit in 1968 and spawned four sequels. That same year he married actress Natalie Trundy, who would play various characters in all four sequels.
At the same time, Jacobs's APJAC merged with Jerome Hellman Productions and produced the musical "Goodbye, Mr Chips" for Jacobs's former employer, MGM. Despite being cheaper and less troublesome to produce than "Dr. Dolittle," it, too, went mostly unnoticed at the box office.
According to Trundy, Jacobs stated, "I will never in my lifetime make a film that cannot be seen by the whole family" and gave the rights to "Midnight Cowboy" to his associate, Jerome Hellman, for no fee, saying, "I will not have my name on it". "Midnight Cowboy" went on to win the 1969 Academy Award for Best Picture for Hellman.
In 1973, APJAC Productions was renamed APJAC International. Jacobs produced the "Reader's Digest"-financed "Tom Sawyer", a musical which featured both a script and musical score by the Sherman Brothers. It was to be the first in a five-picture deal with the prolific composers. But on June 27, 1973, during production of the second film, "Huckleberry Finn", Jacobs died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 51.
In addition to producing "Huckleberry Finn", Jacobs was working on a number of projects at the same time. He had just made a pilot for a TV series, "Topper Returns", starring Roddy McDowall, Stefanie Powers and John Randolph; was the Executive Producer of a "Planet of the Apes" TV series; and was developing a full-length science fiction feature called "Voyage of the Oceanauts". He also wanted to produce a film version of the Frank Herbert novel "Dune".
Trundy, who was filming "Huckleberry Finn" on location at the time of her husband's death, assumed control of APJAC Productions, and sold all rights and financial participation in the "Planet of the Apes" franchise to Fox, choosing to concentrate on other projects.

Magistrates Court of Queensland

The Magistrates Court of Queensland is the lowest court in the court hierarchy of Queensland, Australia. All criminal proceedings in Queensland begin in the Magistrates Court, with minor offences being dealt with summarily, and more serious ones being referred to a higher court on the strength of evidence. Most criminal cases are first heard in the Magistrates Court, as are most civil cases. The Magistrates Court hears approximately 95% of all court cases in Queensland.
Decisions made by the Magistrates Court may be heard on appeal to the District Court of Queensland. The Magistrates Court does not have an appellate jurisdiction.
The Chief Magistrate of Queensland, since 2022, is Judge Janelle Brassington.
Jurisdiction.
Civil.
The Magistrates Court has the jurisdiction to decide on civil matters for which the amount in dispute is less than or equal to 150,000. Civil matters in which the amount in dispute is more than $150,000 are decided by either the District Court or the Supreme Court.
Criminal.
The Magistrates Court has the jurisdiction to decide on charges of summary offences, and indictable offence which may be heard summarily. 
The Magistrates Court also conducts committal hearings in which the presiding magistrate decides, based on the strength of the evidence, whether to refer the matter to a higher court.
Procedure.
Those present at court typically include the magistrate, police prosecutor, defendant, plaintiff and witnesses for either party. It is a condition that those who enter the court bow to the Queensland Coat of Arms, situated behind the Bench, upon entry. Plaintiffs, defendants, their counsel and witnesses must rise when they wish to address the bench or when addressed by the magistrate. 
Members of the media and general public are allowed into the courtroom, except where a party to the proceedings is under 18 in which case the court becomes a child court and the media and public will only have restricted access to the court.

MPLS local protection

MPLS Fast Reroute (also called MPLS local restoration or MPLS local protection) is a local restoration network resiliency mechanism. It is actually a feature of resource reservation protocol (RSVP) traffic engineering (RSVP-TE). In MPLS local protection each label-switched path (LSP) passing through a facility is protected by a backup path which originates at the node immediately upstream to that facility.
This node which redirects the traffic onto the preset backup path is called the Point of Local Repair (PLR), and the node where a backup LSP merges with the primary LSP is called Merge Point (MP). This mechanism (local protection) provides faster recovery because the decision of recovery is strictly local. For comparison, when recovery mechanisms are employed at the IP layer, restoration may take several seconds which is unacceptable for real-time applications (such as VoIP). In contrast, MPLS local protection meets the requirements of real-time applications with recovery times comparable to those of shortest path bridging networks or SONET rings (&lt; 50 ms).
Local protection approaches.
There are two distinct approaches to local protection: (1) one-to-one local protection (detour) (2) many-to-one local protection (facility backup).
One-to-one local protection.
In one-to-one backup approach, the PLRs maintain separate backup paths for each LSP passing through a facility. The backup path terminates by merging back with the primary path at a node called the "Merge Point" (MP). In one-to-one backup approach, the MP can be any node downstream from the protected facility. Maintaining state information for backup paths protecting individual LSPs, as in the one-to-one approach, is a significant resource burden for the PLR. Moreover, periodic refresh messages sent by the PLR, in order to maintain each backup path, may become a network bottleneck.
Many-to-one local protection.
In many-to-one approach, a PLR maintains a single backup path to protect a set of primary LSPs traversing the triplet (PLR, facility, MP). Thus, fewer states need to be maintained and refreshed which results in a scalable solution. The many-to-one backup approach is also called facility backup. Note that in this approach, the MP should be the node immediately downstream to the facility.
Example.
In Fig.1 (right), there is a primary path (label-switched path, or LSP) from A to E via B and D. The traffic of customers connected to A and E will take this path in normal operation. There is also a secondary path (LSP) from A to E via C. This path can be either pre-signaled or not. For the primary LSP, FRR (Fast ReRoute) is enabled. Once enabled, the other network elements on the LSP will know that FRR is enabled. Let's assume there is a break between D and E. D will immediately know this and will inform B and A. For A to know that there is a failure between D and E takes a while, but since D knows about the failure immediately and FRR is enabled on the LSP, it uses the detour path D-C-E to get rid of the failure immediately and traffic will continue to flow along that new path. This takes less than 50ms. Once the secondary LSP is up, traffic is switched to the secondary LSP and the temporary detour path is disabled.
Local protection fault-models.
Link protection.
In a link protection model each link (or subset links) used by an LSP is provided protection by pre-established backup paths.
Node protection.
In a node protection model each node (or subset of nodes) used by an LSP is provided protection by pre-established backup paths.
Element protection.
In an element protection model, protection is provided against the failure of links as well as nodes along the LSP.

Durham University Business School (DUBS) is the business school of Durham University, a collegiate public research university in Durham, England. The school holds triple accreditation from AACSB, AMBA and EQUIS. Following a 1963 report on management education by Lord Franks, the school began teaching in 1965, making it one of the oldest business schools in the UK alongside Alliance Manchester Business School. The school contains the departments of accounting, economics, finance, and management and marketing, as well as twelve research centres.
History.
Business teaching at Durham University dates back to 1913, when a faculty of commerce was established at Armstrong College in the Newcastle division of the then-federal university. In 1963 this, along with the rest of the Newcastle division, became part of the newly constituted Newcastle University, leaving Durham without a business school. However, Durham University had established the Business Research Unit (BRU) in Durham in 1960 under the auspices of the Department of Economics and in collaboration with the Department of Psychology to carry out business and management-related research, under the direction of Alan Odber.
In 1963, the Franks Report recommended the establishment of two major business schools in London and Manchester (which became the London Business School and the Alliance Manchester Business School) and, crucially for Durham, minor business schools elsewhere in the country as warranted by demand. Charles Baker, a lecturer in the Department of Psychology at Durham since 1961 and a member of the BRU, used this to argue for the establishment of a business school. He was able to obtain funding from the Foundation for Management Education (FME) for two lectureships within the BRU in order to offer post-experience courses to managers. A precursor to these courses was the Advanced Management Program run in 1964 at Bede College, Durham by lecturers from Harvard Business School, before the first courses offered by the BRU, under the name of Durham University Business School, were launched at Easter 1965, also at Bede College. The founding staff in the business school were Odber and Baker along with the two lecturers funded by the FME, John Constable and John Machin, both of whom were recruited from industry. The first head of the business school, as head of the BRU in 1965, was Odber. He left for industry at the end of 1965 and was succeeded by Baker, who remained in post until 1984.
In December 1966, the BRU formally changed its name to "the Business School". The connection to Harvard continued, with both Constable and Machin spending a year on the international teachers programme there studying their MBA course prior to the launch of Durham's MSc in Management Services (now the MBA) in 1967. Shortly after this the business school, which had operated as part of the department of economics, became a department in its own right in October 1968, with members of the school continuing to participate in undergraduate teaching on business topics in the departments of economics and engineering science. In 1970 the business school appointed the first specialised lecturer in small businesses in the UK. Durham was now well established as a business school, and when the Conference of University Management Schools (now the Chartered Association of Business Schools) was formed in 1971, Durham was one of the twelve founder members.
Baker became the first Professor in Management at Durham in 1975. In 1977, the business school moved from Old Elvet to Mill Hill, with money raised from industry being used to construct a purpose-built residential business school. The 1980s saw the MSc become the MBA (1986), and the launch of the distance-learning MBA (by 1989).
In the early 1980s, the school was one of four in the country (along with London, Manchester and the Scottish Business School in Glasgow) chosen to deliver the Manpower Services Commission's New Enterprise Programme, training people in how to start their own business.
In 1994, the school's MBA programmes were accredited by the Association of MBAs (AMBA). This was followed by EFMD Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) accreditation in 2005 and Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accreditation in 2009.
In January 2002, the department of economics was merged into the business school and Professor Tony Antoniou, previously chair of the department of economics, was appointed as the sixth dean of the school. He resigned as dean in September 2007 and was suspended as a professor of finance in October 2007 after allegations of plagiarism were upheld by a university panel. In March 2008, Antoniou was dismissed by the university for misconduct; the University of York also withdrew his DPhil after carrying out its own plagiarism enquiry.
The school launched a part-time Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) degree in 2002 as a post-experience professional doctorate. In 2006 it formed a partnership to deliver the DBA at Fudan University in China, with the first students starting in 2007. Fudan remains the main location, but some elements of the course are also delivered at Durham and in San Francisco, USA.
Also in 2007, the school formed a partnership with the EBS University of Business and Law in Germany to deliver its Executive MBA course, after a previous partnership with Provadis in Germany ended. The Executive MBA is a dual award made by both universities. A further DBA partnership was established in 2018 with Emlyon Business School in France, launching the Global DBA: Durham–emlyon as a part-time executive doctoral programme.
In 2019, Durham University Business School became the fourth faculty of the university. In 2022, the Waterside Building, on the River Wear north of the city centre, which had been developed as a new headquarters for Durham County Council, was sold to Durham University as a new site for the business school. 
Facilities.
Durham University Business School is located on two sites in Durham city. The Waterside Building, north of the city centre, is home to the department of management and marketing, including the MBA, DBA and executive education courses. The Mill Hill Lane site, in the Elvet Hill area south of the city centre, contains the departments of accounting, economics and finance.
The Waterside Building falls within the Durham Innovation District, announced in 2023 as a partnership between Durham County Council and Durham University, also taking in the Durham City Incubator, Atom Bank and the Aykley Heads Business Park, as well as Durham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The building contains an executive education hub, a café and other facilities including a 300-seat lecture theatre and a 74-seat "Harvard style" lecture theatre.
The Mill Hill Lane building was built in the 1970s and extensively renovated in 2013. Facilities include a 260-seat lecture theatre and a 180-seat "Harvard style" lecture theatre, along with a restaurant and library spaces. 
Both sites have study spaces, and the Durham University Library study hub at Mill Hill Lane also holds a reference collection of core texts.
Academic profile.
Teaching.
Durham University Business School provides courses at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Undergraduate courses include Bachelor's degrees in the fields of economics, finance, business, marketing and accounting. Postgraduate degrees are offered in management, marketing, finance and economics, including MBA, MA, MSc, DBA and PhD. Courses are offered in full-time, part-time and distance learning formats.
The school has pioneered the use of a virtual campus on the technology platform "Gather Town" to improve networking for students on the online MBA course.
Research.
In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, Durham was ranked 21st of 108 institutions on grade point average (GPA) for business and management studies, with a GPA of 3.32 (compared to an average across the unit of assessment of 3.12). In terms of research power, it was ranked 14th. It was also 14th in terms of number of research-active staff, with 123 full-time equivalent academics entered.
The school has twelve research centres:
The Durham Research in Economic Analysis and Mechanisms research centre has a microeconomics research and skills development partnership with the research and evaluation division of the Competition and Markets Authority, the Microeconomics Unit, based at the UK Government's Darlington Economic Campus.
Accreditation.
The university holds full UK degree-awarding powers which are regulated by the UK's Office for Students. Additional recognition for courses in the business school is provided by accreditation with several organisations at the national and international level, including the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business of the United States – AACSB, the European Quality Improvement System in Europe – EQUIS, and the Association of Masters of Business Administration of the United Kingdom – AMBA.

Los Angeles bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics

The Los Angeles 2016 Olympic bid is a reference to the unsuccessful attempt by the city of Los Angeles, with help from the Greater Los Angeles area, to be chosen by the United States Olympic Committee as the official United States bid for the International Olympic Committee 2016 Summer Olympics host city competition. On July 26, 2006, the USOC had narrowed its list of candidates to Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. San Francisco later withdrew its bid on November 13, 2006. On April 14, 2007, Chicago was selected as the United States bid. Two years later, Chicago lost their bid to Rio de Janeiro when the IOC voted to select the host city.
United States Olympic Committee.
The USOC's chairman, Peter Ueberroth, visited potential host cities in May 2006. Ueberroth and his party visited Los Angeles on May 18.
Los Angeles has many existing sports venues, including many that were built in the years since the 1984 Summer Olympics, when Los Angeles last hosted. Existing venues currently include the following:
Infrastructure.
Several hundred miles of commuter rail and rapid transit are present in Southern California, none of which existed in 1984. Many lines are still under construction, will reach several of the major sporting venues, and are planned to be completed in 2009, the same year the winning city was to be announced.
Sport culture.
Los Angeles is the home of the following professional sports teams:
Prior to 1995, the Rams (1946–1994) and the Raiders (1982–1994) of the NFL were in the Los Angeles market. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and Anaheim Ducks are both based in nearby Anaheim.
No reference to the sport culture of Los Angeles would be complete without mentioning the immensely successful intercollegiate athletics programs at UCLA and the University of Southern California, both of which have been the breeding grounds for countless Olympic gold-medalists in nearly every Olympic sport.
Beach volleyball and windsurfing were both invented in the area (though predecessors of both were invented in some form by Duke Kahanamoku in Hawaii). Venice, also known as Dogtown, is credited with being the birthplace of skateboarding and the place where rollerblading first became popular. Area beaches are popular with surfers, who have created their own subculture.
Los Angeles has twice played host to the summer Olympic Games: in 1932 and in 1984, both of which were profitable, the latter being the most profitable Olympics in history, with profits of over $200 million. When the tenth Olympic Games were hosted in 1932, the former 10th Street was renamed Olympic Blvd. The 1984 Summer Olympics inspired the creation of the Los Angeles Marathon, which has been celebrated every year in March since 1986. 
Super Bowls I and VII were also contested in the city as was the World Cup Final in 1994.
City recognition.
The Los Angeles area contains all kinds of topography, notably the hills and mountains rising around the metropolis (it's the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range); four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries. Thousands of miles of trails crisscross the city and neighboring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access on foot, bike, or horse. Across the county a great variety of outdoor activities are available, such as skiing, rock climbing, gold panning, hang gliding, and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club, which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.
Los Angeles is also known as The Entertainment Capital of the World with Hollywood and its beautiful beaches makes it a wonderful summer city for the games which is seen as a plus for the city. The Los Angeles area, recognized by its sprawling urban terrain, is one of the world's most important centers of culture, science, technology, international trade, and higher education, and is home to numerous world-renowned institutions in a broad range of professional and cultural fields. The city and its immediate surrounding vicinity leads the world in producing popular entertainment—such as motion pictures, television, and recorded music—which forms the base of its international fame and global status.
Developments.
On June 23, 2006, five United States candidates met in California to offer official presentations to the USOC Board of Directors. "Chicago Tribune" reported of the event on June 24, "USOC officials indicated they could whittle down the field of five contenders in as soon as three weeks." The article also stated, "Observers say it's likely to be a three-way horse race between... San Francisco, Chicago and Olympic veteran Los Angeles." As predicted, the USOC on July 26, 2006, officially named San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago as the three US finalists for the 2016 Olympics, dropping Philadelphia and Houston. However, on November 13, 2006, San Francisco withdrew its bid from the national selection process, leaving Chicago and Los Angeles as the only contenders in the U.S. bid.
On January 9, the USOC announced that they will go forward in presenting an American bid to the international competition for the 2016 games. The next step was for the city of Los Angeles and Chicago to have a bid book ready for the committee by January 22 for review and a video stating why the USOC should pick their city to represent America for International competition, to have ready for their cities evaluation See Below. On April 14, the evaluation team presented its findings to the USOC board of directors, and Chicago was chosen as the submission to the International Olympic Committee.
USOC visit.
The USOC toured Los Angeles for a two-day visit on March 1 and 2nd of 2007. They were greeted at the planned athletes village, UCLA, by the Southern California Committee for the Olympic Games, Antonio Villaraigosa, and six Olympic athletes supporting L.A.'s Bid. 
The USOC required the two bidding cities to produce a short video answering the question, "Why their city?" USOC officials were shown a video made by The Walt Disney Studios, that showcased various athletes, movie stars and famous Los Angeles landmarks.
They later attended a dinner party hosted by the Mayor at the Getty Center overlooking the city. Various celebrities, business leaders, politicians and Olympic Athletes were in attendance.
The following day, the committee took the USOC on the Metro Blue Line to Long Beach, showcasing the new 95 miles of existing, under-construction and planned light rail and subway lines of the Los Angeles Transit system.
After the tour of Long Beach, they followed the Blue Line to the Staples Center for a tour of the arena and the Downtown area, where Olympic activities and festivities would take place.
Benefits.
If the 2016 Summer Olympics were to have been held in Los Angeles, the Games would have generated more than $7 billion in potential revenue and create nearly 70,000 jobs. It would have created 67,825 full-time jobs, many of them in the hospitality and transportation industry. Many of these jobs might well have remained after the games, officials said, although they didn't give a figure. Los Angeles is one of the four cities from the United States bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics. 1 September 2015 Los Angeles has been chosen as the U.S. candidate to bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics.
Los Angeles was later selected to host the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.

First Hungarian Republic

The First Hungarian Republic (), until 21 March 1919 the Hungarian People's Republic (), was a short-lived unrecognized country, which quickly transformed into a small rump state due to the foreign and military policy of the doctrinaire pacifist Károlyi government. It existed from 16 November 1918 until 8 August 1919, apart from a 133-day interruption in the form of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. The republic was established in the wake of the dissolution of Austria-Hungary following World War I as a replacement for the Kingdom of Hungary. During the rule of Count Mihály Károlyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost control over approximately 75% of its former pre-World War I territories, which was about , without armed resistance and was subjected to unhindered foreign occupation. It was in turn succeeded by the Hungarian Soviet Republic but re-established following its demise, and ultimately replaced by the Hungarian Republic.
Name.
"Hungarian People's Republic" was adopted as the official name of the country on 16 November 1918, and remained in use until the overthrow of the Dénes Berinkey government on 21 March 1919. Following the collapse of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, the Gyula Peidl government restored the pre-communist name of the state on 2 August 1919.
The government of István Friedrich changed the name to "Hungarian Republic" on 8 August; however, the denomination "Hungarian People's Republic" appeared on some government-issued decrees during this period.
History.
Károlyi era.
The Hungarian People's Republic was created by the Aster Revolution, which started in Budapest on 31 October 1918. That day, King Charles IV appointed the revolt's leader, Mihály Károlyi, as Hungarian prime minister. Almost his first act was to formally terminate the personal union between Austria and Hungary. On 13 November, Charles issued a proclamation withdrawing from Hungarian politics. A few days later the provisional government proclaimed Hungary a people's republic, with Károlyi as both prime minister and interim president. This event ended 400 years of rule by the House of Habsburg.
The Hungarian Royal Honvéd army still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers when Mihály Károlyi was announced as prime minister of Hungary. Károlyi yielded to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's demand for pacifism by ordering the unilateral self- disarmament of the Hungarian army. This happened under the direction of Béla Linder, (minister of war) on 2 November 1918. Due to the full disarmament of its army, Hungary was to remain without a national defence at a time of particular vulnerability. The Hungarian self-disarmament made the occupation of Hungary directly possible for the relatively small armies of Romania, the Franco-Serbian army and the armed forces of the newly established Czechoslovakia.
The Károlyi government's measures failed to stem popular discontent, especially when the Entente powers began distributing slices of what many considered Hungary's traditional territory to the majority ethnic groups in Kingdom of Romania, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and the First Czechoslovak Republic. The new government and its supporters had pinned their hopes for maintaining Hungary's territorial integrity on the abandonment of Cisleithania and Germany, the securing of a separate peace, and exploiting Károlyi's close connections in the French Third Republic. When Károlyi appointed Oszkár Jászi as the new Minister for National Minorities of Hungary, Jászi immediately offered democratic referendums about the disputed borders for minorities, however, the political leaders of those minorities refused the very idea of democratic referendums regarding disputed territories at the Paris peace conference. After the Hungarian self-disarmament, Czech, Serbian, and Romanian political leaders chose to attack Hungary instead of holding democratic plebiscites concerning the disputed areas.
Military and political events changed rapidly and drastically after Hungarian disarmament:
The Entente considered Hungary a partner in the defeated Dual Monarchy, and dashed the Hungarians' hopes with the delivery of successive diplomatic notes. Each demanded the surrender of more land to other ethnic groups. On 20 March 1919, the French head of the Entente mission in Budapest gave Károlyi a note delineating the final postwar boundaries, which the Hungarians found unacceptable. Károlyi and Prime Minister Dénes Berinkey were now in an impossible position. They knew accepting the French note would endanger the country's territorial integrity, but were in no position to reject it. In protest, Berinkey resigned.
Károlyi informed the cabinet that only the Hungarian Social Democratic Party could possibly form a new government. Unknown to Károlyi, however, the Social Democrats had merged with the Hungarian Communist Party; the latter promised that the Russian SFSR would help Hungary to restore its original borders. Although the Social Democrats held a majority in the newly merged Hungarian Socialist Party, the communists led by Béla Kun immediately seized control and announced the establishment of the Hungarian Soviet Republic on 21 March 1919.
Re-establishment and dissolution.
After the fall of the Soviet Republic on 1 August 1919, a social democratic government—the so-called "trade union government"—came to power under the leadership of Gyula Peidl. A decree was issued on 2 August restoring the form of government and the official state name back to "People's Republic". During its brief existence, the Peidl government began to abrogate the edicts passed by the Communist regime.
On 6 August, István Friedrich, leader of the White House Comrades Association—a right-wing, counter-revolutionary group—seized power in a bloodless coup with the backing of the Royal Romanian Army. The next day, Joseph August declared himself regent of Hungary—he held the position until 23 August, when he was forced to resign—and appointed Friedrich as Prime Minister. The state was formally dissolved by the new government on 8 August 1919.

Go West Midlands

Go West Midlands was a bus company in the West Midlands. It was a subsidiary of the Go-Ahead Group in March 2006.
History.
On 2 December 2005, the Go-Ahead Group purchased Diamond Bus and in February 2006 Probus Management (trading as People's Express) with over 100 vehicles and merged the two companies to form Go West Midlands.
In 2006, Diamond relaunched its image, by increasing its frequency on route 16, which basically matched that of Travel West Midlands and increased its frequencies on routes 17, 63, 64, 74 and 87.
However, in November 2007, Diamond withdrew its services on routes 17 and 63 and majorly altered its operations on routes 74 and 87 (cutting parts of the route off completely).
Diamond also lost many Centro and Staffordshire County Council contracts to other operators.
In March 2008, Go West Midlands was sold to Rotala and rebranded as Diamond Bus.
Fleet.
As at March 2007, Go West Midlands operated a fleet of over 130 buses.

The Australian national under-21 rugby union team formerly represented Australia on a national level in age graded rugby union. The team competed at the Under 21 Rugby World Championship, and featured in three championship finals, though they never won the event, losing to South Africa in 2002, New Zealand in 2003 and South Africa again in 2005. Australia finished in fourth place at the final under-21 world championship, held in France in 2006.
In 2008, the International Rugby Board scrapped its under-21 and under-19 world championships in favour of a single under-20 competition, the IRB Junior World Championship. Australia accordingly replaced its under-21 and under-19 sides with a new under-20 side.

Equations defining abelian varieties

In mathematics, the concept of abelian variety is the higher-dimensional generalization of the elliptic curve. The equations defining abelian varieties are a topic of study because every abelian variety is a projective variety. In dimension "d" ≥ 2, however, it is no longer as straightforward to discuss such equations.
There is a large classical literature on this question, which in a reformulation is, for complex algebraic geometry, a question of describing relations between theta functions. The modern geometric treatment now refers to some basic papers of David Mumford, from 1966 to 1967, which reformulated that theory in terms from abstract algebraic geometry valid over general fields.
Complete intersections.
The only 'easy' cases are those for "d" = 1, for an elliptic curve with linear span the projective plane or projective 3-space. In the plane, every elliptic curve is given by a cubic curve. In "P"3, an elliptic curve can be obtained as the intersection of two quadrics.
In general abelian varieties are not complete intersections. Computer algebra techniques are now able to have some impact on the direct handling of equations for small values of "d" &gt; 1.
Kummer surfaces.
The interest in nineteenth century geometry in the Kummer surface came in part from the way a quartic surface represented a quotient of an abelian variety with "d" = 2, by the group of order 2 of automorphisms generated by "x" → −"x" on the abelian variety.
General case.
Mumford defined a theta group associated to an invertible sheaf "L" on an abelian variety "A". This is a group of self-automorphisms of "L", and is a finite analogue of the Heisenberg group. The primary results are on the action of the theta group on the global sections of "L". When "L" is very ample, the linear representation can be described, by means of the structure of the theta group. In fact the theta group is abstractly a simple type of nilpotent group, a central extension of a group of torsion points on "A", and the extension is known (it is in effect given by the Weil pairing). There is a uniqueness result for irreducible linear representations of the theta group with given central character, or in other words an analogue of the Stone–von Neumann theorem. (It is assumed for this that the characteristic of the field of coefficients doesn't divide the order of the theta group.)
Mumford showed how this abstract algebraic formulation could account for the classical theory of theta functions with theta characteristics, as being the case where the theta group was an extension of the two-torsion of "A".
An innovation in this area is to use the Mukai–Fourier transform.
The coordinate ring.
The goal of the theory is to prove results on the homogeneous coordinate ring of the embedded abelian variety "A", that is, set in a projective space according to a very ample "L" and its global sections. The graded commutative ring that is formed by the direct sum of the global sections of the
meaning the "n"-fold tensor product of itself, is represented as the quotient ring of a polynomial algebra by a homogeneous ideal "I". The graded parts of "I" have been the subject of intense study.
Quadratic relations were provided by Bernhard Riemann. Koizumi's theorem states the third power of an ample line bundle is normally generated. The Mumford–Kempf theorem states that the fourth power of an ample line bundle is quadratically presented. For a base field of characteristic zero, Giuseppe Pareschi proved a result including these (as the cases "p" = 0, 1) which had been conjectured by Lazarsfeld: let "L" be an ample line bundle on an abelian variety "A". If "n" ≥ "p" + 3, then the "n"-th tensor power of "L" satisfies condition "N"p. Further results have been proved by Pareschi and Popa, including previous work in the field.

Sheffield district rail rationalisation plan of the 1960s

The Sheffield District Rail Rationalisation Plan was a series of linked railway civil engineering projects, station and line closures and train route changes that took place in and around Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The majority of these changes took place in the 1960s and early 1970s, however the plan, by now much modified in the face of rapidly dwindling freight traffic, was not fully realised until the 1980s.
History.
In the 1960s, the Sheffield area was one of the busiest areas in the country for rail traffic, in particular for freight traffic: a British Rail Board report showed that 10% of the country's rail freight emanated from the Sheffield area. The facilities that existed, however, were built by competing railway companies in the 19th century and were cramped and outmoded. In an era of central government economic planning this was seen as a constraint on Britain's economic growth; government money was made available to relieve these bottlenecks. At the same time, passenger facilities in Sheffield were to be made more convenient, representing the need for faster and more frequent trains on fewer routes stopping at fewer intermediate stations, but allowing more convenient changing between trains for the remaining local and long-distance express trains.
The Plan.
The major part of the rationalisation plan involved:
Details.
Passenger services.
In 1965, Sheffield Midland station's exterior was cleaned for the first time 95 years. At the same time, Sheaf House, new home of British Rail Sheffield Division headquarters were opened. Sheaf House stood on the site of the former Pond Street Goods station closed in 1963. Midland Main Line services South were improved with hourly workings (alternatively via Nottingham or Derby) from 1966 with departure times scheduled just past the hour. Cross-country passenger services from the North-East to the South-West were transformed with services running via Sheffield Victoria station rerouted to Sheffield Midland. Services via Retford and the ECML to London King's Cross were stopped and all London trains routed via the Midland Main Line to London St Pancras. The "Master Cutler" was transferred to the Midland line and lost its Pullman cars.
Stopping trains to Derby and Nottingham were taken off and Heeley, Millhouses and Beauchief stations were closed in June 1968. Stopping trains on the former Midland main line north of Rotherham were also axed in January 1968 and many South Yorkshire stations closed: all Leeds-bound stopping services were diverted to run via Chapeltown and Barnsley replacing the short distance Sheffield-Barnsley and Barnsley-Wakefield stopping trains on this line; York-bound services became semi-fast with Bolton-on-Dearne being the only South Yorkshire station north of Rotherham remaining open on that line.
The Nunnery Curve built in 1870 was upgraded and brought into passenger use, allowing trains arriving in Sheffield from the East over former Great Central lines to access Sheffield Midland. Passenger services to Lincoln, Doncaster, Hull, Grimsby and Cleethorpes were moved from Sheffield Victoria to Midland. It had been suggested that after the closure of Victoria the electrification be extended to Sheffield Midland from the Woodhead Line, but this was dismissed as being too expensive and the Woodhead became a freight only line under the 1984 Trunk Route Plan. All Manchester services were consequently diverted to the Hope Valley Line; electrified passenger services ended on 5 January 1970 and Sheffield Victoria station closed.
After closure the Sheffield to Huddersfield service continued to pass through Victoria by reversing at Woodburn Junction. This service was diverted via Barnsley in 1983 by an initiative of the SYPTE who agreed to subsidise the diversion (see Penistone line). The operation was a success and the diverted service was kept, resulting in subsequent station re-openings at Silkstone and Dodworth, which had both closed in 1959. Victoria station was demolished in 1989.
Freight traffic.
Pond Street Goods station closed on 7 October 1961, Queens Road Goods station on 11 May 1963 and Park Goods station in October 1963. Work on Sheffield freight terminal at Grimesthorpe began at the end of 1963. A third Western entrance to Tinsley Yard over Shepcote Lane was opened in summer 1964 and was electrified. Followed the opening of Grimesthorpe in summer 1965. In order to allow goods trains reach the new Tinsley Marshalling Yard from the north a scissors junction, Aldwarke Junction, was constructed near Parkgate, North of Rotherham. This also enabled passenger trains to reach Sheffield Midland station from the Great Central route following the closure of the Swinton Curve. New lines were constructed from the Great Central in the Attercliffe/Broughton Lane area to reach the Sheffield District Railway and access to Tinsley Marshalling yard. Dr Beeching opened both complexes on 29 October.
Locomotive and train servicing.
Between 1961 and 1965 the fleet of steam locomotives in the Sheffield area was gradually withdrawn and replaced with new diesel locomotives and multiple units. Millhouse's engine shed was the first to close. Grimesthorpe lost its steam locomotives but became the temporary home to the new diesel locomotive fleet pending the opening of the new shed at Tinsley. This new depot, which could service both diesel and electric locomotives opened in February 1964. This resulted in the closure of Grimesthorpe and the steam/electric depot at Darnall, which became a wagon-repair depot and stabling point for Diesel Multiple Units. Barrow Hill and Canklow lost their allocation of steam locomotives in 1965; the former remained open up to February 1991 as a stabling point for diesel locomotives and the latter remained open for servicing visiting steam locomotives until the numbers of these dwindled in 1966 with withdrawals elsewhere.
All remaining servicing of passenger trains was done at Nunnery carriage sidings, or at Midland station itself in the through roads or on the former Pond Street goods depot.
Multiple-aspect signalling.
The multiple-aspect signalling scheme, or MAS, was the two-stage introduction of multiple-aspect light signalling in the Sheffield area, which began in 1971. The scheme began with the reduction of the quadruple track between Sheffield Midland and Dore &amp; Totley and the simplification of the "up" entrance to Sheffield Midland. The reduction in track was completed by January 1972 with the closure of Dore West and Dore South signal boxes. The dive under built in 1900 was taken out of use from 25 June 1972. There, the track was reduced from four to three and to two between Heeley and Dore &amp; Totley. A passing loop was kept between Heeley and Millhouses.
Sheffield Power Box was commissioned between 20 and 22 January 1973. The new box replaced Sheffield station signal boxes A, B, North, South 1 and South 2, as well as Queens Road, Heeley station, Heeley carriage sidings and Millhouses. The end of stage I of the MAS scheme was announced in June.
Between 20 January and 22 January 1973 Sheffield Victoria station was temporarily reopened while Midland station was completely closed for commissioning of the new power box. Only the main up and down platforms were used as the loop platforms had already been lifted. The station was still complete but the electrics were deemed beyond help so the station was strung with light bulbs strung through the station roofing. Trains to Manchester went via Woodhead although diesel traction was used rather than electric working.
Stage II of the MAS was completed on 14 January 1979 when Wincobank signal box was closed. The boxes at Holmes, Masborough and Canklow closed in July 1979 followed on 16 May 1982 by Beighton Junction. Track work at Treeton was realigned and simplified and both boxes, Treeton Junction and Treeton South were closed in October 1982. At that point all Midland lines had been converted to MAS. The Sheffield to Lincoln line is however still operational using semaphore signals controlled by Woodhouse Junction signal box. The resignalling project was completed to encompass Chesterfield, Rotherham and lines north of Sheffield as far as Thurnscoe, Conisbrough, Darfield and Wath.
The outcome today.
As with much of the BR Modernisation Plan, a lot of expenditure was made in upgrading facilities to deal with wagonload freight and heavy industry traffic that would rapidly become obsolete. Tinsley Yard was never used to its full capacity, and although it remained impressively busy until the early 1980s it was almost defunct by the mid-1990s along with its locomotive depot. A major fire in 1985 proved convenient for the closure of the Grimesthorpe parcels/freight depot, which by that time was only being used for limited steel industry-related activity; the Freightliner depot between Masborough and Canklow was found to be more useful for steel loading than containers. The Darnall wagon-repair depot closed in the mid-1980s with the run-down of freight in the area. Nunnery carriage sidings also closed in the mid-1980s with the introduction of High Speed Trains on the Midland Main Line, which required less servicing, all of which was done from Leeds Neville Hill. After that time all remaining passenger train stabling and servicing was done at Midland station or outside the area; this was becoming increasingly problematic in the early 21st century leading to plans to re-open a "Traincare Depot" in the Sheffield area.
The decision to concentrate Rotherham's traffic on Masborough station was a mistake, which lead to declining passenger numbers. This was rectified in 1987 with the switching of Rotherham's passenger traffic to a brand new Central station on the site of its predecessor and, later, the closure of Masborough, albeit via a low-cost single line connection that is now seen to be a bottleneck.
A general increase in passenger numbers in the area since the 1980s has shown that, with hindsight, many of the suburban and urban station closures were premature. The stations at Meadowhall (on the site of the former Wincobank station) and Swinton, closed in the 1960s, were re-opened in 1990. Millhouses has been repeatedly put forward as a candidate for re-opening, with line capacity constraints usually cited as a confounding factor; indeed it is notable that the rationalised track layout to the south of Sheffield Midland that was enabled by the closure of the southern suburban stations is now cited as a major bottleneck. The re-opening of stations at Ecclesfield, Parkgate and Wath-upon-Dearne has also been mooted.

Extra special group

In group theory, a branch of abstract algebra, extraspecial groups are analogues of the Heisenberg group over finite fields whose size is a prime. For each prime "p" and positive integer "n" there are exactly two (up to isomorphism) extraspecial groups of order "p"1+2"n". Extraspecial groups often occur in centralizers of involutions. The ordinary character theory of extraspecial groups is well understood.
Definition.
Recall that a finite group is called a "p"-group if its order is a power of a prime "p".
A "p"-group "G" is called extraspecial if its center "Z" is cyclic of order "p", and the quotient "G"/"Z" is a non-trivial elementary abelian "p"-group.
Extraspecial groups of order "p"1+2"n" are often denoted by the symbol "p"1+2"n". For example, 21+24 stands for an extraspecial group of order 225.
Classification.
Every extraspecial "p"-group has order "p"1+2"n" for some positive integer "n", and conversely for each such number there are exactly two extraspecial groups up to isomorphism. A central product of two extraspecial "p"-groups is extraspecial, and every extraspecial group can be written as a central product of extraspecial groups of order "p"3. This reduces the classification of extraspecial groups to that of extraspecial groups of order "p"3. The classification is often presented differently in the two cases "p" odd and "p" = 2, but a uniform presentation is also possible.
"p" odd.
There are two extraspecial groups of order "p"3, which for "p" odd are given by
If "n" is a positive integer there are two extraspecial groups of order "p"1+2"n", which for "p" odd are given by
The two extraspecial groups of order "p"1+2"n" are most easily distinguished by the fact that one has all elements of order at most "p" and the other has elements of order "p"2.
"p" = 2.
There are two extraspecial groups of order 8 = "2"3, which are given by
If "n" is a positive integer there are two extraspecial groups of order "2"1+2"n", which are given by
The two extraspecial groups "G" of order "2"1+2"n" are most easily distinguished as follows. If "Z" is the center, then "G"/"Z" is a vector space over the field with 2 elements. It has a quadratic form "q", where "q" is 1 if the lift of an element has order 4 in "G", and 0 otherwise. Then the Arf invariant of this quadratic form can be used to distinguish the two extraspecial groups. Equivalently, one can distinguish the groups by counting the number of elements of order 4.
All "p".
A uniform presentation of the extraspecial groups of order "p"1+2"n" can be given as follows. Define the two groups:
"M"("p") and "N"("p") are non-isomorphic extraspecial groups of order "p"3 with center of order "p" generated by "c". The two non-isomorphic extraspecial groups of order "p"1+2"n" are the central products of either "n" copies of "M"("p") or "n"−1 copies of "M"("p") and 1 copy of "N"("p"). This is a special case of a classification of "p"-groups with cyclic centers and simple derived subgroups given in .
Character theory.
If "G" is an extraspecial group of order "p"1+2"n", then its irreducible complex representations are given as follows:
Examples.
It is quite common for the centralizer of an involution in a finite simple group to contain a normal extraspecial subgroup. For example, the centralizer of an involution of type 2B in the monster group has structure 21+24.Co1, which means that it has a normal extraspecial subgroup of order 21+24, and the quotient is one of the Conway groups.
Generalizations.
Groups whose center, derived subgroup, and Frattini subgroup are all equal are called special groups. Infinite special groups whose derived subgroup has order "p" are also called extraspecial groups. The classification of countably infinite extraspecial groups is very similar to the finite case, , but for larger cardinalities even basic properties of the groups depend on delicate issues of set theory, some of which are exposed in . The nilpotent groups whose center is cyclic and derived subgroup has order "p" and whose conjugacy classes are at most countably infinite are classified in . Finite groups whose derived subgroup has order "p" are classified in .

Marist Brothers Secondary School, Dete

Marist Brothers Secondary School, Dete (MBSS), referred to as 'Marist Dete' is a co-educational (mixed) boarding secondary school Dete, in the Hwange district of Zimbabwe’s Matabeleland North Province. The school was established in 1972 and is part of the international family of Marist schools run by the Marist Brothers, a Catholic society founded in 1817 by Saint Marcellin Champagnat in France.
The Marist Brothers Secondary School in Dete provides classes from Form 1 to Form 4. The school introduced Advanced Level classes in 2015. Most of the students come from the Hwange district (Dete, Hwange, Victoria Falls, etc.) and Bulawayo. Due to its high profile and excellent reputation, MBSS also attracts students from further afield, including the Midlands, Matabeleland and Masvingo provinces of Zimbabwe.
School history.
Marist Brothers Secondary School Dete was opened in 1972, as a transfer from St. Mary’s Secondary School in Lukosi, Hwange. St Mary’s Secondary School had been an old Catholic School run by the priests of the Hwange Diocese.
Marist in Dete has classes from Form 1 to Form 4. Academic subjects studied include English Language, English Literature, Ndebele, Mathematics, Geography, Science, Biology, and Bible Knowledge. The school also offers practical subjects including Metalwork, Bicycle Mechanics, Motor Mechanics, Woodwork (Carpentry), Needlework, and Cookery (Food and Nutrition). Typically, every student will produce and take home several pieces of furniture or clothing that they will have produced during the year, for their personal or family use.
Marist motor mechanics students and their teachers have, over the years, created usable motor vehicles using scrap. The most notable of these were "Moonshine", a large truck that was used to ferry goods from Dete to and around the school, and "Sunshine", a small 'body' on 'wheels' runaround vehicle used around the school and farm area. Typically, these vehicles were deliberately never developed to the point of being roadworthy, and were made to lack things such as wind screens, batteries.
In 2014 MBSS came in 17th in the country with 87.3% of its students passing. Students from the school have been among those having the highest scores in the ZIMEC A-level exam. In 2016, the school's quiz team won first place in a contest held in Johannesburg, with 23 schools from South Africa, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe participating.
School life.
The school is divided into four colour-coded 'Houses', Champagnat (Yellow), Lwanga (Red), Mafuyana (Green), and Mzilikazi (Blue). Champagnat House is in honour of Marcellin Champagnat, the founder of the Marist movement. Mafuyana House is in honour of the late mama Mafuyana, wife of the late Vice President of Zimbabwe and Nationalist Freedon Fighter Joshua Nkomo. The house was formally called Chaminuka.
There are eight blocks of residences, four each for girls and boys. Except for a few exceptions over the years, a student typically stays within his or her house throughout the four years at Marist. There are four dining halls, also divided according to the four houses. Here, boys and girls from the same house have meals together. Participation in sports, including inter-house competitions, are also conducted according to one's house. Classes are mixed and include awards with points that a house collects throughout the year. The house with the highest points (from sports, dormitory inspections, and class awards), becomes champions that year. Prizes have included a house picnic at one of the lakes near the school.
Sports.
Various sports are available. The main ones are football (soccer), netball, tennis, volleyball, basketball, and track events. Due to its better sporting facilities, particularly its large and many grounds, Marist Brothers Dete has traditionally been the host school for regional sporting competitions
Marist Old Students Association.
Marist Old Students Association (MOSA) is a non-political and non-governmental Organization of the former students of Marist Brother Secondary Dete, Zimbabwe (MBSS). The organisation was formed to unite and forge ahead in promoting and fostering the growth and development of their former school and integrating those who share in the MOSA vision. This association or organization is a network of former and current MBSS students and teachers and those who share the same vision in the growth and development of the school world over. Membership is open to any person who may be connected to the school in one way or another. A mere interest and love of the school is adequate qualification for one to take part in the discussions. The aims of the organisation are to seek ways of improving the standards of education and general conduct of the school and to provide career guidance to those still studying at the school.
Vision: The vision of MOSA is to help their alma mater in its growth and development so that it may continue to produce a proud, useful and distinguished service persons—persons who will not only be of good and useful service to the school but humanity as a whole, that is, Zimbabwe, Africa and the world.

Harald Grenske

Harald Grenske (10th century) was a petty king in Vestfold in Norway.
Harald Grenske was the son of Gudrød Bjørnsson. Gudrød is claimed to have been grandson of Harald Fairhair and the king of Vestfold. Harald's cognomen "Grenske" is due to his being raised in the district of Grenland, Norway. When Harald was only 11 years old, his father was slain by the sons of Gunnhild Gormsdóttir (i.e. Harald Greyhide and his brothers). Harald fled to Oppland and from there to Sweden, where he stayed with the powerful strongman Skagul Toste. They went on Viking expeditions together, principally within areas of the Baltic Sea.
When the sons of Gunnhild had been banished, Harald Grenske followed Haakon Sigurdsson who ruled Norway as a vassal of the Danish king Harald Bluetooth. Harald became the king of Vestfold and Agder. He married Åsta, the daughter of Gudbrand Kula.
Harald subsequently abandoned Åsta to woo Sigrid the Haughty, the daughter of Skagul Toste. She was the wealthy widow of Eric the Victorious and owned several farms in Svithjod. Sigrid found him too eager with his entreaties. She had him burnt to death inside a great hall following a feast to discourage other suitors. Harald died together with another suitor, Vissevald (Wsevolod) from Gardarike (Novgorod).
Harald's widow, Åsta, promptly gave birth to a son, Olaf Haraldsson, later king of Norway and patron saint of the nation. Åsta subsequently remarried to Sigurd Syr, the king of Ringerike.
No contemporary sources said anything about Harald, and the sagas only mention him in connection with St. Olaf's history. According to Snorri Sturluson in "Olav Trygvasons saga", he was a king of Vingulmark, Vestfold and Agder. Recent scholarship has questioned the historicity of Harald.

Šatrijos Ragana

Šatrijos Ragana ("Witch of Šatrija") was the pen name of Marija Pečkauskaitė (; March 8, 1877 – July 24, 1930), a Lithuanian humanist and romantic writer and educator. Her most successful works are ("In the Old Estate", 1922) and "Irkos tragedija" ("Tragedy of Irka").
Biography.
Born in Medingėnai, Kovno Governorate to a family of petty Lithuanian nobles, Pečkauskaitė was raised in Polish culture. However, she made friends with local Lithuanian peasants and, influenced by her tutor Povilas Višinskis, joined the Lithuanian National Revival. Because of poor health and expensive tuition, Pečkauskaitė did not graduate from a gymnasium in Saint Petersburg and had to complete her education privately in the Labūnava estate near Užventis. Višinskis translated her first works, written in Polish, into Lithuanian and published in liberal Lithuanian periodicals, such as "Varpas" and "Ūkininkas". However, Pečkauskaitė disagreed with their secular agenda and turned to pro-Catholic "Tėvynės sargas" and similar newspapers. After her father's death in 1898, the family moved to Šiauliai as the old estate had to be sold for debts. In 1905 she received a scholarship from the Žiburėlis Society, established by Gabrielė Petkevičaitė-Bitė, to study pedagogy at the University of Zurich and the University of Fribourg. While studying, she met with Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster and was greatly affected by his views on education; she later translated several of his works into Lithuanian. After returning to Lithuania in 1907, Pečkauskaitė briefly stayed in Šaukotas and Vilnius. She participated in the First Congress of Lithuanian Women and was elected its vice-chair. In 1909, she was hired by the Žiburys Society as a teacher at a girls' pre-gymnasium in Marijampolė. In 1915 she moved to Židikai, where she spent her remaining life working as a teacher. She was actively involved in the town's cultural life, promoting teetotalism, organizing a youth chorus, and other charity work. For her achievements in pedagogy, Pečkauskaitė was awarded an honorary degree of the University of Lithuania in 1928. She died in Židikai.
Works.
Pečkauskaitė debuted in 1896 with short story "Margi paveikslėliai" ("Motley Pictures"). Her works reflect social changes in her times: from estates to villages, from former nobles to peasants, from Polish to Lithuanian culture. All of her characters are strong romantic individuals, living according to the Christian ideals. They usually altruistically sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the society. For example, one character, Viktutė, sacrifices her career in the arts to work as a teacher in a small town; or a village lad from "Vincas Stonis" (1906) who successfully takes over his father's farm and even persuades him to return from America. Pečkauskaitė was one of the first Lithuanian writers to create deep and complex characters, analyzing not only their psychology but also spirituality.
Her most critically acclaimed novel, , is somewhat autobiographical and depicts a family of a Samogitian landlord. The estate and manor owners, unlike in writings of Žemaitė or Lazdynų Pelėda, are not the sources of social injustice, but one of the last remaining outposts of old culture, ideas, and values. Through the depiction of Mamatė (a diminutive derivation from "mother") the author expresses the realization that physical life is temporary and longs for permanent metaphysical existence (death). As with other works, parts inspired by her early childhood are especially bright and warm, colored by loving memories of dreams and aspirations, and lean towards impressionism. In contrast, the short story "Irkos tragedija", depicts the painful crash of a young girl's innocent world with harsh reality and family failure.

Gilbert Barling

Sir Harry Gilbert Barling, 1st Baronet (30 April 1855 – 27 April 1940) was an English surgeon.
Life.
Barling was born at Newnham on Severn, Gloucestershire and educated at a boarding school at Weston, near Bath. He went to Birmingham in 1875 at the age of 20, to take his matriculation exam at Queen's College, Birmingham (a predecessor college of Birmingham University), before going on to study at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London and culminating in his admittance to the Royal College of Surgeons in 1879, becoming a Fellow in 1881. It was at this time he was appointed resident pathologist at the General Hospital which would start an association lasting for 60 years. He became President of the hospital in 1925. He was awarded his M.B. degree in 1879 at St Bartholomew's, and his B.S. degree in 1883 at St Bartholomew's and Birmingham.
In 1904, Barling was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Birmingham, succeeding Sir Bertram Windle, who was appointed president of Queen's College, Cork. From 1913 to 1933 he held the office of Vice Chancellor (renamed Pro-Chancellor in 1927) of the University of Birmingham, during which time and under his guidance the research departments in mental diseases and cancer were founded. He was Vice President and Chairman of the Council of The Birmingham Civic Society for 22 years from its creation in 1918 until his death in 1940. He was also for many years the Chairman of the Birmingham Hospital Saturday Fund. His association with the university had begun in 1885 when he was appointed Demonstrator of Anatomy at Queen's College and he was for many years on the teaching staff of the Medical School, becoming Professor of Pathology in 1885. In 1893 he was appointed co-professor of Surgery at Mason College (into which the medical faculty of Queen's College had merged and which later became Birmingham University) and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine.
At the outbreak of the First World War he was 59 and placed his services at the disposal of the Royal Army Medical Corps, acting as consulting surgeon in the Southern Command, subsequently being posted at the rank of colonel to the Western Front from October 1916 to August 1917. His service to King and Countrymen earned him the Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) (military) in 1917 and in 1919 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). On 10 September 1919 King George V conferred upon him a Baronetcy and the College of Arms granted his Coat of Arms some three months later.
In 1923 he had been involved in the setting up of the Birmingham Branch of the British Empire Cancer Campaign (now Cancer Research UK) and became its first Chairman. He was a hard worker and talented administrator and in 1936, in recognition of his hospital, university and other public service, he was presented with The Birmingham Civic Society's Gold Medal (a rare accolade given to those who have made a high contribution to life in Birmingham).
Death.
Sir Gilbert Barling chaired his last meeting of the Civic Society's Executive Council on 19 March 1940. He died from heart failure at his home (whilst in his garden) at 6 Manor Road, Edgbaston on Saturday 27 April 1940, just three days before his 85th birthday. At the next meeting of the Society's Executive Council, Mr Oliver Moreland temporarily assumed the Chair and it was agreed to send a letter of sympathy to Miss Edith Barling, one of his two daughters, who also sat on the Executive Council.
The funeral took place at St Augustine's Church, Edgbaston on Wednesday 1 May 1940. The Birmingham Mail reported that the eloquent testimony to the esteem in which Sir Gilbert was held was manifested at the funeral, which the Lord Mayor also attended. He had sat on the Church Council of this church for some years and often took sermons at the invitation of the vicar, indeed between 1868 and 1978 the vicarage of St Augustine's Church, Edgbaston was next door, at 4 Manor Road and is where his neighbour Dr Rosslyn Bruce lived between 1912 and 1923.
Legacy.
On 16 February 2018, The Birmingham Civic Society erected a Blue Plaque in Barling's honour, on his former home at 6, Manor Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham.
The papers of Gilbert Barling and also a collection of material relating to Barling, compiled by his daughter, Edith are housed at the University of Birmingham Special Collections.

Ariel (film)

Ariel is a 1988 Finnish drama film directed and written by Aki Kaurismäki. The film tells the story of Taisto Kasurinen (Turo Pajala), a Finnish miner who must find a way to live in the big city after the mine closes.
Taisto's friend is played by Matti Pellonpää, an actor who appeared in many of Kaurismäki's early films, before his death in 1995.
This is the second film in Kaurismäki's Proletariat Trilogy ("Shadows in Paradise", "Ariel", and "The Match Factory Girl"). The trilogy has been released on Region One DVD by Criterion in its Eclipse box-sets. The film is included in the "1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die" list. The film was entered into the 16th Moscow International Film Festival, where Turo Pajala won the Bronze St. George for Best Actor.
Kaurismäki has called "Ariel" his best film in his career.
Plot.
A mine gets closed in Finnish Lapland, putting a number of miners including Taisto Kasurinen (Turo Pajala), out of work. In a café, an older miner advises Kasurinen that there is no future in mining. He gives Kasurinen the keys to an old (1962) white Cadillac convertible, then walks into the men's room and shoots himself. Kasurinen drives the convertible to southern Finland, where he is mugged and has his life savings stolen. He gets a labouring job and finds a cheap bed at a nearby hostel.
Impressed with the Cadillac, metermaid Irmeli flirts with Kasurinen. Rather than waiting for her shift to end, she quits her job to accept his dinner invitation. In bed together at her home, they discuss their pasts. Irmeli recounts stories of her ex-husband and Kasurinen tells her that he is from the country, to which she replies "that's different". He is woken up by Irmeli's young son holding a gun in his face and offering him breakfast.
Kasurinen is kicked out of the hostel when he fails to pay for his bed and begins sleeping in his car. In need of money, he reluctantly sells it. He drifts around the city, occasionally smoking cigarette butts left in ashtrays. While sitting in a diner, he spots one of the men who robbed him, chases him, grabs the knife the man pulls out and holds him at knifepoint. The police arrest Kasurinen for attempted armed robbery. He is sentenced to nearly two years in jail. As he is leaving the courtroom, he makes eye contact with a distressed Irmeli from across the room.
Kasurinen proposes marriage to Irmeli during one of her visits to prison and Irmeli accepts. Later, Irmeli brings him a birthday cake and a book with a saw inside it. He and his cellmate Mikkonen (Matti Pellonpää) escape together. Outside, Kasurinen and Irmeli get married. Kasurinen and Mikkonen rob a bank to fund their journey out of the country. The men who had promised them passports stab Mikkonen in order to get the loot for themselves. Kasurinen shoots them dead but is unable to save Mikkonen. The film ends with Kasurinen, Irmeli and her son boarding a ship named "Ariel", heading to Mexico.
Home media.
A digitally restored version of the film was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection as part of its Eclipse Series.

Esther Muir

Esther Muir (March 11, 1903 – August 1, 1995) was an American actress on Broadway and in Hollywood films.
Early years.
Born in Andes, New York, Muir had six sisters and three brothers. She began modeling in New York City while still a high school student.
Career.
Stage.
While she was in high school, Muir became a showgirl in the "Greenwich Village Follies" (1922). She participated in the "International Review", Majestic Theatre&lt;ref name="ibdb/4746"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and in "The Earl Carroll Vanities".
Film.
Muir appeared with the Marx Brothers in "A Day At The Races" (1937). She toured with the Marxes in a stage version where material from the movie was rehearsed and crafted prior to filming. Muir described the Marx Brothers as diligent comic actors who sometimes worked days and weeks on a scene to perfect it. "We played pranks and had many laughs in spite of the hard and messy work. The Marx Brothers ad-libbed funnier material than the four top writers could concoct for them. It was an unforgettable experience, as well as a lucrative ordeal." Her other screen credits include roles in "I'll Take Romance" (1937), "City Girl" (1938), and "The Girl and the Gambler" (1939).
"The disappointment of my life was failure to play Belle Watling in "Gone With the Wind". Some people had written in and suggest me for the part, and David Selznick sent the script to me. I was on cloud nine. I shall never forget the producer saying, 'I have run several of your pictures and admire your work. Every time you play a tough character, however, some sweetness comes through. Someday I will use you.' He sensed my great disappointment."
Personal life and death.
An introduction by columnist Walter Winchell eventually led to Muir's marriage to Hollywood director and choreographer Busby Berkeley. They were married in Baltimore, Maryland, in November 1929 and were divorced in 1931. "His mother was widowed when Bus was a little boy, so she kept him on a leash until he married," she said in 1990. "I was my husband's keeper, but she continued to collect his salary. Her delusions of glamour, with a Park Avenue apartment in New York, a mansion in Dover and Loretta Young's mansion in Beverly Hills, required a Getty income to cover her expenses. I was left with the bills for our little Hollywood apartment and the necessities of life." She originally quit working to focus on her husband but the need for money prompted her to accept a role in a "My Girl Friday!" revival, which eventually led to the divorce.
On January 3, 1932, Muir and actor Rex Lease announced their engagement. No date had been set for the wedding, and the two were awaiting final decrees in divorce actions.
Muir married composer/producer Sam Coslow in Mexicali, Mexico, on November 1, 1934. The couple repeated their wedding vows a year later in Ventura, California. The marriage ended in divorce in 1948. Her daughter, Jacqueline Coslow, became an actress and married actor Ted Sorel (né Theodore Eliopoulos).
Muir was also married to Richard Brown, president of General Time Corporation.
Muir developed real estate in southern California in the 1950s. Four hundred tract homes were among the projects that she supervised. She briefly had polio but completely recovered in two years.
On August 1, 1995, Muir died at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York, aged 92. She had lived in Somers, New York.

Audio-visual speech recognition

Audio visual speech recognition (AVSR) is a technique that uses image processing capabilities in lip reading to aid speech recognition systems in recognizing undeterministic phones or giving preponderance among near probability decisions.
Each system of lip reading and speech recognition works separately, then their results are mixed at the stage of feature fusion. As the name suggests, it has two parts. First one is the audio part and second one is the visual part. In audio part we use features like log mel spectrogram, mfcc etc. from the raw audio samples and we build a model to get feature vector out of it . For visual part generally we use some variant of convolutional neural network to compress the image to a feature vector after that we concatenate these two vectors (audio and visual ) and try to predict the target object.

Peace &amp; Love (festival)

Peace &amp; Love was the largest music festival in Sweden, known for its humanitarian message, pervasive throughout the event. It started in Borlänge and ran from 1999 until the company filed for bankruptcy in 2013. 
The Peace &amp; Love Crew announced that they would continue to do the much loved festival and in 2014 the festivals were back on under the name "Peace &amp; Love World Forum". Since then it has expanded and has gone back to its old name "Peace &amp; Love". The festival was cancelled in 2020 due to the ongoing pandemic, and shortly the festival declared bankruptcy. 
History.
The Peace &amp; Love Festival was first held in 1999, as a reaction to the ongoing violence. The first festival was held at a club in central Borlänge, with about 900 attendees. Since then the festival was held at different locations in central Borlänge. The Peace &amp; Love Festival was one of Scandinavia's fastest-growing festivals. In 2006 there were 15,000 visitors per day, with over 37,000 people attending in total. The 10th Peace &amp; Love Festival was in 2008 and had a record of 25000 visitors, which made it the second biggest festival in Sweden.
2008.
The tickets sold out as early as 23 May, and the festival got a lot of attention in nationwide media. 2008 was celebrated as the tenth festival. Artist that played, amongst others, were Sex Pistols [UK], Manu Chao [FR/ES], Kent, Teddybears, The Wombats [UK], Crystal Castles [CAN]. As a late surprise Roky Ericson and The Nomads was announced.
2009.
The festival was held between 22 June and 27 June. This year Peace &amp; Love became Sweden's biggest festival with 41 685 tickets sold. Some of the bands and artists were: Mötley Crüe (US), The Kooks (UK), Volbeat (DK), Milow (BE), Keane (UK), Thåström and Håkan Hellström.
2010.
In 2010, the event took place between 28 June and 3 July - the same weekend as other major Scandinavian festivals Roskilde Festival and Hove Festival. The festival sold 42 000 tickets. This year, amongst others, Jay-Z, Lily Allen, Patti Smith, The Kooks and Kent played.
Theme.
Each year, Peace &amp; Love focuses on a subject that they theme the festival on. 
Artists.
Over the years, artists such as Patti Smith, New York Dolls, Vitalic, Jay-Z, Tech N9ne, Lily Allen, Them Crooked Vultures, Alice Cooper, Slayer, W.A.S.P., Surkin, NOFX, Ed Harcourt, Vive la Fête, Hanoi Rocks, Motörhead, Cut Copy, and Khonnor, Familjen, Rootvälta, Den Svenska Björnstammen, Miike Snow, Name The Pet, The Cardigans, Thåström, Håkan Hellström, The Sounds, Mando Diao, Lars Winnerbäck, Ulf Lundell, The Hives, Looptroop, The Hellacopters and Silverbullit, among many others. The band which has played the most often at the Peace &amp; Love festival is Sugarplum Fairy, a rock band from Borlänge whose two singers, Carl and Victor, are younger brothers of Gustaf Norén from the better-known band Mando Diao, also a rock band from Borlänge. Sugarplum Fairy has played every year since 2001.
Some of the bands that have played:
Peace &amp; Love City bandy club.
In 2016, the festival started a cooperation with the leading local bandy club, which led the bandy club to change its names from Borlänge Bandy to Peace &amp; Love City.

Noak Bridge

Noak Bridge is a housing estate and civil parish on the northern edge of Basildon in the Borough of Basildon, Essex.
The estate takes its name from the bridge over the River Crouch at the foot of nearby Noak Hill. Prior to its development most of the area was secondary woodland that had developed on the site of previous plotlands known as 'Central Park'. The continued use of South African street names in part of the area reflects the street names in the previous development.
When people first moved into Noak Bridge the area was often popularly referred to as 'Wash Road', or the 'Wash Road Estate' after the road on its northern boundary, which in turn took its name from the 'wash' or ford that has now been replaced by a bridge just before the road's junction with Harding Elms Road.
Part of that secondary woodland survives as Noak Bridge Nature Reserve.
Noak Bridge is a rare example of a post-war, social housing estate that has been designated a Conservation Area . First planned in the 1970s as part of Basildon new town, Noak Bridge was separated from the rest of the town and it was decided that it should have the traditional character of an English village. The project architects were Maurice Naunton and George Garrard. Construction began in 1979 and within 3 years almost 400 rented dwellings had been built, including bungalows and sheltered housing, as well as a school, surgery, and shops. In terms of urban design, it as an early example of successful "place-making".
School.
The area's only primary school is Noak Bridge School (full name "Noak Bridge County Primary School"). The school has approximately 250 pupils, from the pre-school on to year 6. The school opened in September 1982, but for the first half-term operated from the former Nevendon School site (now the ITEC centre) on the Burnt Mills Industrial Estate.
Parish council.
Noak Bridge has a parish council and collects a tax to meet local needs. The parish was created in 2002, having previously been an unparished area directly administered by Basildon Council.
Village Hall.
The Noak Bridge Village Hall serves as a Councillor's surgery.
Medical Centre.
Noak Bridge Medical Centre serves those within the Noak Bridge, Noak Mead &amp; Noak Park, Steeple View and Crays Hill areas.
Shops.
The area's two shops are a Pharmacy and a Post Office/Londis.
Nature Reserve.
The Noak Bridge Nature Reserve lies to the south east of the settlement and consists of twenty acres of meadow, scrub and woodland. It contains several ponds which attract a variety of amphibians and dragonflies.
The Reserve is the remains of the secondary woodland that covered much of the site before the estate was developed. This secondary woodland was notable for containing numerous garden species as well as pioneer woodland species such as hawthorn and oak.

Topwater fishing lure

A topwater fishing lure or walker is a type of surface fishing lure, usually floating just at the water surface, that may be moved about the surface of water in order to attract and cause fish to attempt to strike the lure. Non-floating versions may be retrieved at sufficient speed to cause them to travel at the water's surface.
Such lures are often designed to resemble smaller creatures that would normally be considered as food for the target game fish species. They are painted to look like the prey of the target species; usually smaller baitfish, frogs or insects. One of the key features of the topwater lure is the serpentine "walking" action that it imparts as it travels along the water's surface. The more effective lures have an action that closely resembles that of the actual living creature. The lure is typically fitted with one of more fish hooks (usually treble hooks) to hook the target fish as it strikes the lure. Variations exist that include internal rattles to generate sound that might be similar to the sounds created by the actual, live creature being emulated. some also include small light sources such as LEDs that might be battery powered. There are also jointed bodies, moving eyes, holographic finishes, etc. all of which are incorporated to encourage the target species to strike the lure. The lure is normally attached to the end of a fishing line that is attached to a fishing rod and reel and is cast into areas where the target species might be found and "worked" skillfully within that area to encourage strikes. This type of fishing is considered by many to be one of the more exciting methods used to catch fish. A frequent mistake when fishing topwater lures is to initiate the hookset immediately upon seeing the fish strike the lure. In many species, especially bass, it is important to wait a few seconds before initiating the hookset to ensure that the lure is in the best position in the fish's mouth to optimize the chances of a successful hooking. Black bass, spotted seatrout, ladyfish, redfish, bluefish, tarpon, bonefish, barracuda, &amp; pickerel are examples of fish that might be taken by the topwater approach.

<doc id="6990836" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6990836" title="Crystal Beach, Ottawa">
Crystal Beach, Ottawa

Crystal Beach is a neighbourhood in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the west end of Ottawa, in Bay Ward. The neighbourhood is triangular in shape, and its boundaries can broadly be described as Carling Avenue to the northeast, Moodie Drive to the west, and Corkstown Road to the south. According to the Canada 2011 Census, the total population of the neighbourhood was 2,416.
History.
Crystal Beach was established in the 1960s, when the area was within Nepean Township. Primarily developed by Minto Developments Inc., many of the residences in Crystal Beach are modified versions of the five original models of homes originally built in the neighbourhood. The neighbourhood was later extended in 1974 around Carling via Corkstown Road with townhomes and in 1988 with Maki Park. Some newer portions of the neighbourhood were built by Garand Homes.
Today, Crystal Beach is a primarily residential neighbourhood with a strong sense of community, and over the years, has become one of the most desired real-estate locations in Ottawa. Much of Crystal Beach's appeal is due to its close proximity to the Nepean Sailing Club, Andrew Haydon Park, the Carling Campus and Ottawa River, its award-winning neighbourhood design (to reduce traffic flowing through), easy access to the Queensway (Highway 417), quality schooling, community centre, and the recreational facilities within.
Together with the Lakeview neighbourhood south of Corkstown, and the Stonehedge and Creeks End neighbourhoods east of Holly Acres Road, the area is covered by the Crystal Beach Lakeview Community Association (CBLCA). The area north of Carling is the neighbourhood of Rocky Point, which is a partner of the CBLCA.
Transportation.
Crystal Beach is a 15-minute drive from downtown, and about five minutes from Kanata. From this neighbourhood there are easy ways to access both the west end and centre of Ottawa, as Crystal Beach is served by two major arteries (Highway 417, Carling avenue).
Public transportation is provided by OC Transpo, with Route 58 as the primary route for the community as of 2021. Bayshore and Moodie station are within walking distance from certain parts of the community.

Hypercomplex manifold

In differential geometry, a hypercomplex manifold is a manifold with the tangent bundle
equipped with an action by the algebra of quaternions
in such a way that the quaternions formula_1
define integrable almost complex structures.
If the almost complex structures are instead not assumed to be integrable, the manifold is called quaternionic, or almost hypercomplex.
Examples.
Every hyperkähler manifold is also hypercomplex.
The converse is not true. The Hopf surface
(with formula_3 acting
as a multiplication by a quaternion formula_4, formula_5) is
hypercomplex, but not Kähler,
hence not hyperkähler either.
To see that the Hopf surface is not Kähler,
notice that it is diffeomorphic to a product
formula_6 hence its odd cohomology
group is odd-dimensional. By Hodge decomposition,
odd cohomology of a compact Kähler manifold
are always even-dimensional. In fact Hidekiyo Wakakuwa proved
 that on a compact hyperkähler manifold formula_7. 
Misha Verbitsky has shown that any compact
hypercomplex manifold admitting a Kähler structure is also hyperkähler.
In 1988, left-invariant hypercomplex structures on some compact Lie groups
were constructed by the physicists Philippe Spindel, Alexander Sevrin, Walter Troost, and Antoine Van Proeyen. In 1992, Dominic Joyce 
rediscovered this construction, and gave a complete classification of 
left-invariant hypercomplex structures on compact Lie groups. 
Here is the complete list.
where formula_11 denotes an formula_12-dimensional compact torus.
It is remarkable that any compact Lie group becomes
hypercomplex after it is multiplied by a sufficiently
big torus.
Basic properties.
Hypercomplex manifolds as such were studied by Charles Boyer in 1988. He also proved that in real dimension 4, the only compact hypercomplex
manifolds are the complex torus formula_13, the Hopf surface and 
the K3 surface.
Much earlier (in 1955) Morio Obata studied affine connection associated with "almost hypercomplex structures" (under the former terminology of Charles Ehresmann of "almost quaternionic structures"). His construction leads to what Edmond Bonan called the "Obata connection" which is "torsion free", if and only if, "two" of the almost complex structures formula_1 are integrable and in this case the manifold is hypercomplex.
Twistor spaces.
There is a 2-dimensional sphere of quaternions
formula_15 satisfying formula_16.
Each of these quaternions gives a complex
structure on a hypercomplex manifold "M". This
defines an almost complex structure on the manifold
formula_17, which is fibered over
formula_18 with fibers identified with formula_19. 
This complex structure is integrable, as follows
from Obata's theorem (this was first explicitly proved by 
Dmitry Kaledin). This complex manifold
is called the twistor space of formula_20.
If "M" is formula_21, then its twistor space

No-observed-adverse-effect level

The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) denotes the level of exposure of an organism, found by experiment or observation, at which there is no biologically or statistically significant increase in the frequency or severity of any adverse effects of the tested protocol. In drug development, the NOAEL of a new drug is assessed in laboratory animals, such as mice, prior to initiation of human trials in order to establish a safe clinical starting dose in humans. The OECD publishes guidelines for Preclinical Safety Assessments, in order to help scientists discover the NOAEL.
Synopsis.
Some adverse effects in the exposed population when compared to its appropriate control might include alteration of morphology, functional capacity, growth, development or life span. The NOAEL is determined or proposed by qualified personnel, often a pharmacologist or a toxicologist.
The NOAEL could be defined as "the highest experimental point that is without adverse effect," meaning that under laboratory conditions, it is the level where there are no side effects. It either does not provide the effects of drug with respect to duration and dose, or it does not address the interpretation of risk based on toxicologically relevant effects.
In toxicology it is specifically the highest tested dose or concentration of a substance (i.e. a drug or chemical) or agent (e.g. radiation), at which no such adverse effect is found in exposed test organisms where higher doses or concentrations resulted in an adverse effect.
The NOAEL level may be used in the process of establishing a dose–response relationship, a fundamental step in most risk assessment methodologies.
Synonyms.
The NOAEL is also known as NOEL (no-observed-effect level) as well as NEC (no-effect concentration) and NOEC (no-observed-effect concentration).
US EPA definition.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines NOAEL as 'an exposure level at which there are no statistically or biologically significant increases in the frequency or severity of adverse effects between the exposed population and its appropriate control; some effects may be produced at this level, but they are not considered as adverse, or as precursors to adverse effects. In an experiment with several NOAELs, the regulatory focus is primarily on the highest one, leading to the common usage of the term NOAEL as the highest exposure without adverse effects.'

Massacre of Novgorod

The massacre of Novgorod () was an attack launched by Ivan the Terrible's "oprichniki" on the city of Novgorod, Russia, in 1570. Although initially an act of vengeance against the perceived treason of the local Orthodox church, the massacre quickly became possibly the most vicious in the brutal legacy of the "oprichnina", with casualties estimated between two thousand to fifteen thousand and innumerable acts of extreme, violent cruelty. In the aftermath of the attack, Novgorod lost its status as one of Russia's leading cities, crippled by decimation of its citizenry combined with Ivan's assault on the surrounding farmlands.
Origins and rationale.
Paranoia, power, and the oprichnina.
The late 1560s under Ivan the Terrible were rife with conspiracies and violence. Ivan's mental state was continually deteriorating and was exacerbated by his wars with Sweden, Lithuania, and Poland. Ivan's deep distrust of the boyars, a sentiment held from childhood, coupled with his paranoia and need for control, led him to create the oprichnina in 1565.
The oprichniki were essentially a private army under Ivan's personal control with the power to "pronounce official disgrace upon, execute and confiscate the property of disobedient boyars without the advice of the [boyar] council." Ivan proceeded to exercise this right liberally, as he attempted to purge all those whom he deemed a threat.
Treason at Izborsk.
One year before the carnage, in 1569, the tsar evicted several thousand from Novgorod and the neighboring town of Pskov in an attempt to avoid a betrayal like the one in Izborsk. He also began to execute anyone he deemed a threat; for example, in 1568, over 150 boyar council members and noblemen (along with their households in some cases) in Moscow were killed in response to real or imagined conspiracies, as well as anyone who protested against the oprichnina.
The suspicious circumstances surrounding the loss of Izborsk (despite the fact that Ivan managed to recover the town), along with growing unrest among the aristocrats in Moscow, convinced Ivan that treason was widespread and expanding, prompting him to take murderous action against those he viewed as the largest threats, his cousin, Prince Vladimir Andreyevich, and the city of Novgorod.
Rumors and doubts.
Shortly after the executions of Prince Vladimir and most of his family, Ivan launched an attack on Novgorod, claiming treason and treachery. It is probably not a coincidence that Novgorod still housed a number of the late Vladimir's supporters and retainers.
Defection to Poland–Lithuania.
Though the reasoning behind the attack was generally kept secret, there were rumors of a conspiracy among the boyars of the city, aided by the Archbishop of Novgorod, Bishop Pimen, to surrender the city to the king of the Polish–Lithuanian commonwealth.
There is much speculation about the authenticity of the evidence behind the rumors (a document of questionable origin) considering that relations between Pimen and Ivan were relatively amicable.
One theory was that Peter, the man who informed Ivan of the document's existence and location, had been punished by the people of Novgorod and composed the document in revenge, forging the signatures of the archbishop and other important citizens. It is also possible that Polish agents planted the documents in an attempt to unseat or at least destabilize Ivan.
There is little to no concrete evidence to suggest that Novgorod actually planned to defect to Poland–Lithuania. Novgorod's planned defection (as well as its alleged plan to convert en masse to the Roman Catholic Church) had been used as part of the justification of Ivan III of Russia for taking direct control of the city in 1478, and it seems that Ivan IV copied his paternal grandfather on this and several other occasions – fighting the same battle twice.
Ivan in Novgorod.
Initial attack.
In the summer of 1569, Ivan and the oprichnina council decided to march on Novgorod that December to exact revenge for the alleged treasonous behavior. Ivan's force started from Alexandrov Village, where he resided and ruled from December 1564 to February 1565, when he had fled Moscow before the creation of the oprichnina. They moved from Klin at the beginning of the Tver district, sweeping westward through Tver and other centers, then all the way to Novgorod, plundering and terrorizing each population, laying waste to everything in their path.
On 2 January 1570, the advance regiment of the tsar's armies arrived on the outskirts of the city, four days before the tsar. They were to construct a barrier around the city, trapping the inhabitants. The regiment also attacked the monasteries surrounding the city, looting the treasuries and beating and/or imprisoning the clergy.
Confrontation with Archbishop Pimen.
On 6 January, the tsar arrived with his son Ivan, his court, and roughly 1,500 musketeers in tow. Ivan stopped just before entering the city, in the trading quarter of Gorodische, to set up his camp and royal court, issuing his initial orders from there. On the second day (7 January), the clergy members, the father superiors and monks, who had been arrested by the advance regiment, were to be beaten to death and their bodies returned to the monasteries to be buried.
On 8 January, Ivan proceeded into Novgorod and was met on the bridge over the Volkhov River, as was customary, by the Archbishop Pimen. In line with tradition and ceremony, the archbishop attempted to bless the tsar, but Ivan refused, accusing Pimen (and with him, all of Novgorod) of treason and of conspiring to turn the city over to Poland–Lithuania. Ivan refused to approach the cross that came with the welcoming procession, stating to the archbishop: 
Despite his reproof of the archbishop, Ivan still demanded that he be taken to the Saint Sophia Cathedral for divine liturgy. Ivan's piety and the fact that he was not entirely mentally sound led him to demand that the clergy say liturgy amid the general confusion and disorder caused by the entrance of the tsar and his armed retinue. Afterward, Ivan's company dined with Pimen, though that too was interrupted by chaos. Shortly after the meal began, Ivan shouted orders to his assembled guard to arrest Pimen and to plunder his residence, treasury, and court. The prelate was publicly insulted and mocked by the tsar, who paraded him around the city on a mare while facing backwards and accompanied by "skomorokhi" (Russian folk minstrels, outlawed by the Russian Orthodox Church as a hold-over from paganism). He was then arrested and imprisoned while Ivan sacked the city.
Attack on the Church.
Under the advance regiment.
Ivan's first commands from Gorodishche concerned the immediate subjugation and humiliation of the church. He ordered that his regiment confiscate the treasuries of the outlying monasteries, as well as begin the brutality of the trials at Gorodishche. Initially, around 500 father superiors and monks from the outlying churches (the same clergymen that he would order beaten to death two days later), were rounded up, taken into Novgorod and flogged. The priests and deacons of the churches inside the city were to be arrested and turned over to the bailiffs to be held in shackles and flogged from dawn until dusk unless or until they could pay a ransom of 20 rubles each.
Looting.
St. Sophia Cathedral.
Following the arrest of the archbishop and his subsequent imprisonment, Ivan's soldiers set about stripping the cathedrals and churches of all of their valuables. They stripped the St. Sophia cathedral, making off with valuable ornaments and icons as well as the ancient Korsun gate from the altar.
Suburban monasteries.
Though the trials held by the tsar's court at Gorodishche were drawing to a close, the assault on the city persisted. Ivan began to tour prominent monasteries in the suburbs of the city, supervising the oprichniki as they continued to loot the monastic treasuries. When Ivan began his sweeps of the surrounding churches, about two to four weeks later, his men set out to finish the job they started before the tsar's arrival. 
Subjugation of Novgorod.
Though Ivan believed that Pimen and the church were the primary architects of the plot for Polish defection, he took out the brunt of his sadistic anger on the population of Novgorod, namely the upper and middle classes. The peasantry suffered a more generic, though equally brutal, punishment that contrasted with the targeted brutality directed at the more prominent members of society.
Trials at Gorodishche.
Before his arrival in the city, Ivan's army had rounded up and detained the leading merchants, traders and officials along with their families. They were tortured for information regarding the supposed defection and liaison with the Polish king. The judges employed exceedingly cruel tortures to facilitate their inquiries, including burning with a "clever fire-making device" called a grill by the chronicler, roasting over fires, or being strung up by one's hands and having one's eyebrows singed off. An equally brutal punishment also awaited many upper and upper-middle-class families, including those implicated or questioned.
Women and children of all ages were bound and thrown from a high bank into the Volkhov river where they were trapped under the ice. Soldiers patrolled the water in boats, armed with boat hooks, spears, lances and axes, pushing down anyone who managed to surface alive. Those condemned by the court, after enduring questions under torture, were often tied to sleds and dragged through town until they too were forced off the bridge into the river.
The “Novgorod Chronicle’’ has been able to identify many of the people summoned to the courts for examination. They included boyars from the archbishop's court (and many serving-men), lesser boyars, merchants, and traders. The court condemned approximately 200 gentry, more than 100 servants, 45 secretaries and chancery people, and a proportionate number of families to die during their occupation of the city.
Treatment of the lower classes.
Middle class, merchants.
In addition to the tortures visited on the upper and middle classes, the peasants and paupers also were treated with disregard and disdain, albeit of a broader nature. The oprichniki centered its attack on the townspeople around two main objectives: to increase the royal treasury and to terrorize the lower classes into submission. Ivan's fear of conspiracies and revolution in any combination, led him to try to quell disaffection and discourage revolutionary tendencies, generally through the manipulation of fear and violence.
Near the end of the greater part of the Gorodische trials, Ivan ordered an attack on the trade streets of Novgorod, hoping to cripple the middle-class merchants (generally considered to be the seat of discontented revolutionary ideas) in order to suppress popular insurrection and guarantee dependency and submission. The oprichniki were to seize all profitable goods and destroy shops and storehouses, then move into the suburbs, where their instructions were to loot and destroy homes and kill all inhabitants who resisted (and, periodically, even those who complied), regardless of age or sex. Cold, hunger, and disease also killed the hundreds of families that were evicted and exiled from the city and surrounding villages.
Lower class.
The famines that had plagued the area for the previous years (exacerbated by the oprichniki's razing of the farm land on their trek to Novgorod) had drawn many of the poor from the surrounding land into the city for shelter. With little regard for the lives at stake, the tsar ordered the collected paupers and beggars expelled from the city in the middle of winter, abandoning them to die of exposure or starvation.
Ramifications.
Pskov and Moscow.
Ivan and the oprichniki continued to brutalize Novgorod until 12 February, when the troops withdrew leaving the destroyed city in the hands of the remaining population. They continued with this murderous quest to rid the kingdom of traitors, moving first to Pskov for a brief (and bizarre) interlude, then back to Moscow, where Ivan continued to arrest and interrogate anyone he considered guilty, dangerous or even a possible threat. He looked into the supposed treachery at Novgorod within his own court, examining who had contact with the archbishop and therefore may have been involved in the plot.
His suspicions were especially focused on several prominent members of the boyar court, Alexis Basmanov and his son, Nikita Funikov (the treasurer), Viskovaty (the keeper of the seal), Semeon Yakovlev, Vasily Stepanov (the crown secretary), Andrei Vasiliev, and Prince Afanasy Viazemsky.
While the details of the investigation have been lost, the trial results are known. Most of these men, court favourites Basmanov and Viazemsky included, were condemned to death along with Prince Peter Obolensky-Serebriany and a handful of others. Most others, around 180 people, were given pardon. Pimen of Novgorod was removed first to Alexandrov and finally to Tula, where he died under uncertain circumstances.
Casualties.
Ivan's terrible ‘vengeance’ left Novgorod severely wounded. The death toll of the massacre is uncertain. According to the "Third Novgorod Chronicle", the massacre lasted for five weeks. The "First Pskov Chronicle" gives the number of victims as 60,000. These numbers are debated, however, and are not from an impartial source. Western sources from the time give figures ranging from 2,700 to 27,000 killed. Modern researchers estimate the number of victims in a range from 2,500 up to 12,000. Ruslan Skrynnikov, reconstructing the sinodiki (prayer lists) of the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery, found only 1,505 named victims of the massacre, although these were most likely elite citizens and lesser citizens were not listed. Based on these lists, Skrynnikov considers that the number of victims was 2,000 to 3,000. As the author of "Ivan the Terrible (Ivan Grozny)", R.G. Skrynnikov stated, "the sack of Novgorod is the most repulsive episode in the brutal history of the oprichnina. The cruel, senseless slaughter of innocent people made oprichnina synonymous with lawlessness and excess."
Decline of Novgorod.
Ivan's attack, while not solely at fault, contributed heavily to the decline of the once great city of Novgorod. An attack from one's own ruler, especially one as devastating to life and property as Ivan's campaign against Novgorod, would have been psychologically crippling, even more so when considered with the previous blows dealt to the city by Ivan IV and his grandfather. After the attack, many of the inhabitants either fled the city to escape persecution from Moscow, or died from increasingly damning conditions, exacerbated by high taxes and food shortages (and the epidemics that tend to accompany poor living conditions) that followed the departure of the oprichniki.
As part of his attack Ivan burned the fields, laying waste roughly 90 percent of the arable land surrounding Novgorod. Coupled with the crop failures of the years before, this would create a massive food shortage (and cause supply in the Livonian war). With the loss of the majority of its production capacity and the economy essentially in ruins, Novgorod, a city that, until Ivan III, rivaled Moscow for the seat of power in Russia, lost its political standing and the Novgorod Republic officially became a thing of the past.

Cobaea scandens

Cobaea scandens, the cup-and-saucer vine, cathedral bells, Mexican ivy, or monastery bells, is a species of flowering plant in the phlox family Polemoniaceae. It is native to Mexico, with isolated sightings elsewhere in tropical central and South America.
Description.
It is a self-clinging perennial climber. The Latin specific epithet "scandens" means 'climbing'. The leaves comprise four leaflets and a tendril furnished with small hooks for clinging on to a support. The large forward-facing flowers open white, but become violet as they mature. They are pollinated by bats in their native habitat, are bell-shaped with a pronounced ruff – hence the name cup-and-saucer. Mature flowers are scented. Present a capsular fruits with seeds.
Cultivation.
It is widely cultivated for its twining habit and its highly ornamental flowers, long, which change from white to purple. In temperate regions it is best grown as a half-hardy annual, sown in heat under glass in early spring, and planted out after all danger of frost is past. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017). A white form exists, "C. scandens" f. "alba".
Darwin's observations.
Charles Darwin in 1875 made a detailed study of various climbing and twining plants, subjecting them to stimuli such as light and touch, and presenting them with a range of surfaces while minutely examining their movement over time. He was impressed by the exceptional strength and speed of "Cobaea scandens":

Chūō-ku, Sapporo

 is one of the ten wards in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. Chūō-ku means "central ward" in Japanese. City administration and entertainment facilities are centred in this ward.
History.
During Meiji Period, Sousei river, precursor of Susukino district, Sapporo Beer company and the drill hall of the former Sapporo Agricultural College were built in the area where Chūō-ku is currently located. After Sapporo was divided into wards (ku, 区), Sapporo Agricultural College, currently Hokkaido University, was moved to what would become Kita-ku, and was replaced by the Sapporo wards administration building.
In 1922, Sapporo was chartered as a city. The 1st Sapporo Snow Festival was held during the Showa period, and Sapporo City Hall was erected in 1971.
Chūō-ku was officially established in 1972, when the Sapporo Olympics was held and Sapporo was accredited as one of the city designated by government ordinance. During the Olympics, Chūō-ku hosted the normal hill ski jumping event and the ski jumping portion of the Nordic combined event. The other 6 wards (Higashi-ku, Kita-ku, Minami-ku, Nishi-ku, Shiroishi-ku and Toyohira-ku) were also established in the same year. The ski jump would be a venue when the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships would be held at Sapporo in 2007.
Overview.
The ward is located in the center of Sapporo. As a downtown district of the city, there are a lot of governmental offices and buildings of companies. The City Hall of Sapporo, the office building of the government of Hokkaido and the headquarters of Hokkaidō Police office are located.
Chūō-ku is also the centre for sightseeing, and many of historical and entertainment facilities of Sapporo are located. Odori Park lies on the centre of the ward, and Sapporo TV Tower is placed on the eastern end of the park. The Sapporo Snow Festival is also held annually in Odori Park. The largest shinto shrine in Hokkaidō prefecture, Hokkaido Shrine (Hokkaidō jingu) is located in Miyanomori area, and draws a number of people on the island during Oshougatsu (the New Year's Day). Maruyama Zoo, Mt. Okura Ski Jump Stadium, and Miyanomori middle hill jump stadium are near the shrine.
Susukino area has many bars and pubs. The street car runs from there to Odori Park going around the ward. A panorama view is enjoyable on the top of Mt. Moiwa, which has a ropeway. Memorial guest hall, Hōhei Kan, is in Nakajima Park, which houses a music hall Sapporo Concert Hall "Kitara". The Hokkaido University Botanical Gardens is also in this ward.
Economy.
Hokkaido Railway Company has its headquarters in the ward. Hokkaido International Airlines (Air Do) is headquartered in Chūō-ku. Yomiuri Shimbun has a branch office in the ward.
Japan Airlines, at one time, operated a ticketing facility on the second floor of the Imon Sapporo Building in Chūō-ku. On March 31, 2009, the facility closed.

Rosemont Theatre

The Rosemont Theatre is a concert hall in Rosemont, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. The venue, which has seats for 4,400 people, opened in 1995 and hosts many different musical artists and shows. It is located near O'Hare International Airport, Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Allstate Arena and Donald E. Stephens Convention Center.
About.
The Mayor of Rosemont, Bradley Stephens, is currently planning to sell the site to the state of Illinois to use as a casino in an effort to gain revenue. The idea was initially pitched in September 2007 and again in May 2008, to lawmakers in Springfield who have expressed interest in the state-owned casino as they are still seeking ways to support a $31 million public works program advanced by former Governor Rod Blagojevich. In 2012, Akoo International, Inc. purchased five-year naming rights for $1.5 million. The company specializes in making interactive media for college dorms, malls and shopping centers. Along with naming rights, the company also create visual content for artists performing at the theatre and the Allstate Arena. Akoo International went out of business in January 2013 and the venue returned to its former name beginning March 2013.
The theatre was planned to be demolished and moved for an upcoming expansion for the adjacent Fashion Outlets of Chicago following an approval from the village of Rosemont to do so in May 2018. This never came to fruition after the expansion was called off in 2020, and Rosemont Theatre was not demolished.

Genius + Love = Yo La Tengo

Genius + Love = Yo La Tengo is a 2-disc album by Yo La Tengo, consisting of rarities, alternate versions, and out-takes, spanning 1988 to 1995. The album was released on Matador in 1996; a Japanese version with two extra tracks appeared in 1998.
The title is a pun on the 1961 Ray Charles album, "Genius + Soul = Jazz". ("The Genius" was Charles' nickname.)
The first disc contains songs with vocals. There are several cover songs, such as John Cale's "Hanky Panky Nohow", The Velvet Underground's "I'm Set Free", Beat Happening's "Cast a Shadow", and Wire's "Too Late". The cover of Daniel Johnston's "Speeding Motorcycle" features Johnston calling in his vocals to the song via telephone. "Demons" originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 1995 film "I Shot Andy Warhol" (in which YLT appeared as a Velvet Underground-esque band).
The second disc consists entirely of instrumental pieces. Included are songs previously recorded by the group (such as an 8-second drum solo), and covers, such as the Urinals' "Surfin' with the Shah," and a wedding-band-like rendition of the Ramones' "Blitzkrieg Bop." "Sunsquashed" is a 26-minute psychedelic jam, from which one of the band's main fansites took its name.

Huntington Bank Pavilion

Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island is an outdoor amphitheater located on the human-made peninsula Northerly Island, in Chicago, Illinois. The venue is a temporary structure, with the summer concert season running from May or June until September or October. The amphitheater opened in June 2005. It was previously named the FirstMerit Bank Pavilion, and before that the Charter One Pavilion.
Known as the "Venue with a View", the amphitheater has views of Lake Michigan, Burnham Harbor, Soldier Field, and the Chicago skyline.
History.
The venue lies on the former site of Meigs Field. On March 30, 2003, Mayor Richard M. Daley ordered a midnight demolition of the airfield. The construction crew excavated six large X's on the runway. Daley stated the continued operation of the airfield was a threat to Chicago's cityscape, using the events of 9/11 as a reference. The airfield was set to continue operation until 2011, when it would be turned over to the City of Chicago. No one within state or city government were consulted on the demolition besides Daley. The Federal Aviation Administration fined the city $33,000, with an additional one million paid in grants.
In August 2003, construction crews were sent in to continue demolition of the airfield. Originally, the space was planned to become an aviation museum. Daley refuted the plan and proposed the space become a lakefront park and nature reserve. Within the allocated 91 acres, Northerly Island was born. Over four acres were set aside for the forthcoming music venue.
About the venue.
With the new advent of the nature reserve to replace Meigs Field, the Chicago Park District proposed an outdoor music venue, similar to the Ravinia Pavilion. Construction began in December 2004. Since the venue would be located on the nature reserve, the structure would be erected in June and disassembled in September of each year. The venue was designed by Mark Dewalt of Valerio Dewalt Train Associates; costing $1.7 million to construct. The amphitheater features a 56' × 40' stage with 15' × 20' video screens on either side of the stage. It features three grandstands (totaling 3,666 seats) and a general admission area (totaling 4,500 seats). The Chicago Park District receives roughly $250,000 from the venue (through sponsorship deals) and $1 from every ticket sold during concert season. The venue opened June 24, 2005, with a concert by American band Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.
After the COVID-19 pandemic, the venue implemented a new bag policy at their events. To reduce staff contact with guest belongings, they allow clear plastic, vinyl or PVC tote bags no larger than 12” x 6” x 12” and/or small clutch bags (4.5”x 6.5”). No other bags of any type will be allowed.
2013 expansion.
The Chicago Park District originally sought expansion in 2010, wanting to increase capacity to 14,000 and attract mainstream acts to the venue. The city voted against the expansion in 2011. In March 2013, the Chicago Plan Commission approved a $3 million plan to grow the venue's capacity from 8,000 to 30,000 seats. This would mean rotating the stage to feature a lawn seating area, increasing the overall space of the venue from 4.78 to 6.9 acres. Additionally, two 300-seat grandstands were added, while the lawn arena can accommodate 22,000. There's a 12-foot slope from the front of stage to the rear of lawn, providing the proper elevation change so that the lawn can be used as a park area when not in use by the pavilion. The expansion also includes shuttle buses from the neighboring Soldier Field to help concert attendees with parking. The main entrance was widened to accommodate the capacity expansion. Delay systems for sound were added to the stage and lawn area. The original video screens were replaced by two 14' × 27' LED screens and two 11' × 17' LED screens in the lawn area.
The newly renovated venue was expected to open June 27, 2013. However, due to heavy rainfall the opening was postponed. Concerts by Dispatch and O.A.R. were relocated to the UIC Pavilion. It was opened on June 29, 2013 by Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band.
Naming.
Upon original conception, the venue was known as the Lakefront Pavilion. On June 22, 2005, it was announced Charter One Financial purchased naming rights for five years, for $2.5 million. From 2005 until 2013, the venue was known as the Charter One Pavilion at Northerly Island. With new construction underway, it was revealed the venue was seeking a new sponsorship deal. In June 2013, Ohio-based FirstMerit Corporation purchased a multi-year naming rights agreement. The length of the contract and amount were not disclosed. From June 27, 2013 until January 8, 2017 the venue was known as the FirstMerit Bank Pavilion. Huntington Bank acquired FirstMerit Bank near the end of 2016. On January 9, 2017 the venue name was changed to reflect this. The venue is now known as Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island.

Gaioz Devdariani

Gaioz Devdariani () (February 2, 1901 – 1937) was a prominent Georgian revolutionary, Soviet politician, member of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences and a victim of the Great Purge of 1937.
Biography.
Devdariani was born in the village of Kharagauli, Western Georgia into a large family. In 1919, Devdariani was arrested by the Menshevik Government of Georgia for plotting and masterminding an insurrection against the democratically elected government. He was imprisoned in Metekhi but managed to escape from the prison in 1920. Between 1921 and 1923, Devdariani worked in various communist ministries of Georgian SSR. From 1929 to 1931 Devdariani became the first Minister of Education of the Georgian SSR. During the same year Devdariani became the honorable member of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences in the department of Economics. After only a year as a Minister, he was promoted to the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Georgian SSR. However, soon after his appointment, Lavrentiy Beria (Communist Party Secretary of Transcaucasia) started agitations and provocations against Gaioz.
Brothers of Devdariani, George Devdariani (commanding officer of the Soviet Division in Transcaucasus) and Shalva Devdariani held important positions in the Georgian SSR and the Communist Party. They became the first targets of Beria and Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze. In 1933, George Devdariani was shot by one of the deserters from his division. It has been alleged that Beria plotted the desertion and instructed the soldier to kill his commanding officer. In 1934 Shalva Devdariani was arrested in Tbilisi and was said to have been personally executed by Beria. After learning of his brother’s arrest and execution, Devdariani resigned from his position and moved to Zaporizhia, Ukraine. There he became the head of a military aviation factory. Under pressure from Beria, Joseph Stalin gave an order to arrest Devdariani and indict him with charges of plotting to assassinate Lavrentiy Beria and of having links with exiled Leon Trotsky. Devdariani was declared an "enemy of the people" and was denounced for Trotskyism. While the charges against Devdariani were entirely false, Beria, a master provocateur, persuaded Stalin to grant him an approval for Devdariani's liquidation.
Before the arrest and murder of his brothers, based on his personal letters, Devdariani had lost any belief in communism and confessed to his family members of being intolerant of Stalin, Beria and the Bolsheviks. Before his final days in a Tbilisi prison cell, he hoped for the chance to emigrate to Leuville-sur-Orge, France, where he would join the Menshevik government of Noe Zhordania in exile. However, he was condemned to death by the NKVD troika and executed in 1938. His son, Spartak Devdariani was sent to the Eastern Front in Penal military unit (being charged under Article 58 of counter-revolutionary activities) where he was killed during the Prague Offensive. His second son David Devdariani was imprisoned for being the “son of the enemy of the people” (Russian language: "сын врага народа"). He later became a political dissident and activist for independent Georgia. He was finally released by the order of Nikita Khrushchev.
Devdariani published numerous books and articles about Communism and Georgia, of which the most popular one was "The History of Communism in Georgia", "Narkvevebi sakartvelos komkavshiris istoriidan" (1927, 1931), "Sakartvelos komkavshiris ati tslis tavi" (1927), "Sakartvelos komkavshiris sataveebtan" (1927) and "Imperializmi da proletaruli revolutsia" (1930).

Charles Potts

Charles Potts (born August 28, 1943) is an American counter-culture poet. He is sometimes referred to as a projectivist poet and was mentored by Edward Dorn. Raised in rural Mackay, Idaho, Potts left Pocatello, Idaho and Idaho State University in the mid '60s and set out for Seattle, Mexico, and ultimately the location where he rose to literary prominence: the countercultural hotbed of Berkeley, California.
There, he founded the Litmus literary magazine and the Litmus publishing company, which published his friend Charles Bukowski's book "Poems written before jumping out of an 8 story window". Potts' gives an account of his time as a revolutionary hippie in the Berkeley poetry scene, and a psychotic breakdown he suffered there, in his two-part memoir Valga Krusa.
In the '80s Potts moved to Walla Walla, Washington where he later founded The Temple bookstore, Tsunami Publishing, and The Temple Literary Magazine.
Tsunami Inc. issued books by Stephen Thomas ("Journeyman", 1997), klipschutz ("Twilight of the Male Ego", 2002), and others. Potts in effect “rediscovered” klipschutz (pen name of Kurt Lipschutz), whom he had featured in seven out of 20 issues of his quarterly, The Temple Literary Magazine.
Potts' biography is also of record in the Marquis publications, Who's Who in America, 1977, Who's Who in the West, 1996, Who's Who in the World, 1996, and Who's Who in Finance and Industry, 1998.
Potts, better known as a poet, also won Manuscript's International's First Place Novel Award for Creative Excellence in 1991, for the Novel Loading Las Vegas. He was given a Distinguished Professional Achievement Award by the Alumni Association and the College of Arts and Sciences at Idaho State University in 1994. He has a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Washington Poets Association in 2008.
Also a singer/songwriter, Potts tapes and CDs recorded at Studio 13 in Salt Lake City and Bayside Audio in Austin, Texas, which is home to the Charles Potts Magic Windmill Band (named for him but in which he does not play) circulate underground. Various YouTube videos of his recordings were made by Bill Anderson.
A political and economic geographer, How the South Finally Won the Civil War: And Controls the Political Future of the United States, published in 1995, got a boost in recognition when the Harvard educated and Boston College professor of history, Heather Cox Richardson, published a similarly titled book, How the South Won the Civil War, with Oxford University Press in 2020.
Potts’ most recent book in The Fifth Convulsion: The Structure of American History.
Potts' collected works, letters, and publishing materials were housed in the archives of Utah State University's Merrill-Cazier Library in Logan, Utah in 2011.

Bent (magazine)

Bent is a free magazine that targets gay men and is distributed to 400 gay bars, clubs and saunas around the United Kingdom. Published monthly by All Points North UK in Leeds, it largely focuses on entertainment, celebrities, film, DVD and music as well as television, comedy and scene news.
Description.
"Bent"s editor is Gordon Hopps; his involvement with the magazine began in the late 1980s when its earliest incarnation, "All Points North", was launched. Since then, the magazine has undergone many changes. It was relaunched in the mid-1990s as "North of Watford" (NOW) but the logo was challenged by IPC Media who also have a title called "NOW". After a number of years, and to prevent a costly court case, "North Of Watford" underwent another format change and became "Bent". Hopps has been involved in all areas of the magazine at different times being Editor in Chief at all the major changes.
Regular columnists Adam Lowe and Simon Savidge provide the main body of features. Features editor Adam 'Beyonce' Lowe conducts celebrity interviews, writes the music reviews and the "Beauty &amp; the Freaks" column. Simon Savidge is the London Editor whose interviewing technique has garnered a host of new fans to his work. He is also the author of Simon Says the problem page, with a witty edge. Terry George, the magazine's publisher, also writes a column in "Bent".
At its peak the circulation reaches 60,000 copies (equal to that of "Gay Times") and perhaps as high as 100,000 copies across the UK. This reflects a circulation of 1–1.7% of the entire UK population and up to 10–17% of the LGBT community. Estimated readership is said to be 150,000 in the magazine's online media pack.
Big-name cover stars and non-traditional subject matter have seen Bent's popularity rise, particularly with its often striking covers that tend to feature minimal text and attention-grabbing images. The magazine acquired a slightly different and 'greener' look when it began to get its paper from a sustainable source.
As a gay lifestyle magazine "Bent" also carries items on fitness, beauty, travel, health advice, gadgets and fashion but also includes features, interviews with up-and-coming porn stars and illustrated erotic short stories. As a free sheet, advertising provides the revenue for the production and distribution of the magazine. It is also available on subscription for a charge and can be downloaded online for free.

Ammonium sulfamate

Ammonium sulfamate (or ammonium sulphamate) is a white crystalline solid, readily soluble in water. It is commonly used as a broad spectrum herbicide, with additional uses as a compost accelerator, flame retardant and in industrial processes.
Manufacture and distribution.
It is a salt formed from ammonia and sulfamic acid.
Ammonium sulfamate is distributed under the following tradenames, which are principally herbicidal product names: Amicide, Amidosulfate, Ammate, Amcide, Ammate X-NI, AMS, Fyran 206k, Ikurin, Sulfamate, AMS and Root-Out.
Uses.
Herbicide.
Ammonium sulfamate is considered to be particularly useful in controlling tough woody weeds, tree stumps and brambles.
Ammonium sulfamate has been successfully used in several major UK projects by organisations like the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers, English Heritage, the National Trust, and various railway, canal and waterways authorities.
Several years ago the Henry Doubleday Research Association (HDRA) (known as Garden Organic), published an article on ammonium sulfamate after a successful set of herbicide trials. Though not approved for use by organic growers it does provide an option when alternatives have failed.
The following problem weeds / plants can be controlled:
Japanese Knotweed ("Reynoutria japonica", syn. "Fallopia japonica"),
Marestail / Horsetail ("Equisetum"),
Ground-elder ("Aegopodium podagraria"),
"Rhododendron ponticum",
Brambles,
Brushwood,
Ivy ("Hedera" species),
Senecio/Ragwort,
Honey fungus ("Armillaria"), and 
felled tree stumps and most other tough woody specimens.
Compost accelerator.
Ammonium sulfamate is used as a composting accelerator in horticultural settings. It is especially effective in breaking down the tougher and woodier weeds put onto the compost heap.
Flame retardant.
Ammonium sulfamate (like other ammonium salts, e.g. Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, Ammonium sulfate) is a useful flame retardant. These salt based flame retardants offer advantages over other metal/mineral-based flame retardants in that they are water processable. Their relatively low decomposition temperature makes them suitable for flame retarding cellulose based materials (paper/wood). Ammonium sulfamate (like Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate) is sometimes used in conjunction with Magnesium sulfate or Ammonium sulfate (in ratios of approximately 2:1) for enhanced flame retardant properties.
Other uses.
Within industry ammonium sulfamate is used as a flame retardant, a plasticiser and in electro-plating. Within the laboratory it is used as a reagent.
Safety.
Ammonium sulfamate is considered to be only slightly toxic to humans and other animals, making it appropriate for amateur home garden, professional and forestry uses. It is generally accepted to be safe for use on plots of land that will be used for growing fruit and vegetables intended for consumption.
It corrodes brass, copper, and iron. Its contact with eyes or skin can be harmful unless it is quickly washed off.
In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set a permissible exposure limit at 15 mg/m3 over an eight-hour time-weighted average, while the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends exposures no greater than 10 mg/m3 over an eight-hour time-weighted average. These occupational exposure limits are protective values, given the IDLH concentration is set at 1500 mg/m3.
It is also considered to be environmentally friendly due to its degradation to non-harmful residues.
European Union licensing.
The pesticides review by the European Union led to herbicides containing ammonium sulfamate becoming unlicensed, and therefore effectively banned, from 2008.
Its availability and use as a compost accelerator is unaffected by the EU's pesticide legislation.

Dream Children (Elgar)

Dream Children, Op 43 is a musical work for small orchestra by Edward Elgar. There are two movements:
History.
These two pieces were written in 1902, when Elgar was approaching the peak of his fame and popularity. Unusually for Elgar they were not written to any commission. Michael Kennedy suggests that they may have been retrieved from the unused material for a symphony celebrating General Gordon which Elgar had been working on since 1898. They are not complete symphonic movements (the first movement takes a little over three minutes to perform and the second a little over four minutes) but it was Elgar's practice to work in small sections and then put them together into a whole.
Ernest Newman described "Dream Children" as "a couple of delicate little pastels for a small orchestra, inspired by an essay of Charles Lamb. Elia ("sc." Lamb), entertaining some children with stories of their grandmother, finds them gradually disappear from his sight he is, indeed, only dreaming":
Newman continues, "The two pieces are very short – 24 and 141 bars respectively. The first, a tender little reverie with much lovely feeling underlying its simplicity, is the better of the two. The second, though charming, is more obvious in its sentiment. At the end of it there is a return to the theme of the first".
The orchestral score and parts were originally published by Joseph Williams Ltd (London) in 1902, and then in 1911 by Schott &amp; Co with the title Enfants d'un Rêve and the translation below this "(Dream-Children)". As with his earlier piece Salut d'Amour, Elgar agreed with the same publisher that the French title would sell better.
The first performance was at the Queen's Hall on 4 September 1902, conducted by Arthur W Payne.
Instrumentation.
2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in B and A, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 3 timpani, harp and strings.

I Love the Nightlife

"I Love the Nightlife (Disco 'Round)" is a popular disco song recorded by American singer-songwriter Alicia Bridges in 1978. It was released as the first single from her debut album, "Alicia Bridges" (1978), and went to number two on the US "Billboard" National Disco Action Top 30 (now the Dance Club Songs chart) for two weeks. It became a crossover hit, peaking at number five on the "Billboard" Hot 100, and found worldwide success, reaching the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands and South Africa, as well as reaching the top 30 in the UK. A re-release in 1994 allowed the song to reach number four in New Zealand and number five in Iceland.
Background.
The song was co-written by Alicia Bridges and Susan Hutcheson in 1977 for Bill Lowery, founder of Southern Music. "I Love the Nightlife" was the first single produced by Steve Buckingham who was invited to produce the single's parent album entitled "Alicia Bridges" after he had played guitar on a session by the singer. Bridges suggested to Hutcheson that they write a song with either "disco" or "boogie" in the title after Bridges saw a current top-ten hit list featuring several songs with dance-oriented titles. The original title of the resultant song: "Disco 'Round", became the subtitle under the main title "I Love the Nightlife" as Buckingham considered it an R&amp;B number and did not want it labeled disco. Bridges herself would later admit that she had hopes that the song would be received as a Memphis soul number, calling it "something Al Green might sing". However it is as a disco classic that the song is most remembered: in an August 26, 1998 MTV countdown of the Top 54 Dance Songs of the Disco Era, "I Love the Nightlife" was ranked at number 37.
1994 re-release.
In 1994, the song gained renewed interest after being featured in the film "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert". It was subsequently re-released and found the best success in New Zealand, where it reached number four in February 1995, 12 places higher than its original peak of number 16. The re-release also reached number five in Iceland and number 11 in Australia. Because of its association with the film (and also because Bridges herself is an open lesbian), the song is closely linked with gay culture. It was remixed for this release.

Canna 'Trinacria Variegata'

"Canna" Italian Group 'Trinacria Variegata'. The earliest mention of this cultivar is in 1927, "An Amateur in an Indian Garden" by S. Percy-Lancaster, F.L.S., F.R.H.S., M.R.A.S., in which it was described and referred to by this name.
A small Italian Group cultivar; variegated foliage, oval shaped, white margin, spreading habit; round stems, coloured green + purple; clusters of flowers are reflexed, yellow and white, staminodes are large, edges ruffled, petals red, fully self-cleaning; seed is sterile, pollen is low fertile; rhizomes are long and thin, coloured white; tillering is average.
It has eye-catching variegated leaves, with large butter-yellow blooms, marked by this plants signature - a white stripe down the centre of each petal forming a white cross. It has variegated leaves of green with pale yellow variegation parallel to the veins.
Nurserymen folk legend has it that in 1923, or thereabouts, a consignment of Canna 'Trinacria' rhizomes was despatched to Siam, now Thailand, from a nursery in California. When it arrived at its destination and was grown out it was found to have variegated foliage. A sample was returned to the nursery with a demand for a refund or replacement as it was not what had been ordered.
This mutation was probably caused by the extreme conditions endured in transport from California to Thailand in the days before air travel. The cultivar was examined in the 1960s by Dr. Khoshoo, who stated that this was not a chimeral mutation.

Politics of Dundee

Politics in the Dundee City ("Mòr-bhaile Dhùn Dèagh" in Gaelic) council area are evident in the deliberations and decisions of Dundee City Council, in elections to the council, and in elections to the Scottish Parliament (Holyrood) and the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (Westminster).
In the European Parliament, the city area was within the Scotland constituency, which covered all of the 32 council areas of Scotland.
Dundee City became a single-tier council in 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, with the boundaries of the City of Dundee district of the Tayside region, minus a Monifieth area and part of a Sidlaw area, which were transferred from the city area to the new council area of Angus. The city district was also the administrative centre for the region.
The new city council area was named "The City of Dundee" in the legislation of 1994, but this was changed to "Dundee City" by a council resolution on 29 June 1995, under section 23 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 (c. 65). In terms of area, it is the smallest of Scotland's council areas.
The district had been created in 1975, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, to include: the former county of city of Dundee; a Monifieth area, including the burgh of Monifieth (but not Newtyle and Kettins areas), previously within the county of Angus; and a Longforgan area previously within the county of Perth.
The county of city was created in 1894, and the city area has included the burgh of Broughty Ferry since 1913. Dundee has been a royal burgh since 1191.
City council.
Council meetings take place in the City Chambers, located in City Square. They were opened in 1933. The council executive is based in Dundee House on North Lindsay Street. The civic head and chair of the council is known as the Lord Provost. In 2017, Scotland's longest serving councillor, Ian Borthwick MBE became the Lord Provost of Dundee. A number of councillors are appointed as ceremonial bailies.
The Leader of the Council, as head of the largest political grouping, is Councillor John Alexander (SNP).
Composition and control.
The council consists of 29 councillors:
The SNP gained a majority on the council after the 2012 elections. In the previous council, the SNP had the largest number of seats but the council was initially controlled by a Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition, with the support of the Conservatives. This changed after a March 2009 by-election result which tipped the balance further in the SNPs direction. 
However the 2017 contest saw the SNP lose their majority, although they remained the largest party with 14 councillors. Labour also lost one seat, while the Conservatives gained two seats and Liberal Democrats gained an additional councillor.
Until 2019, the council was governed by an SNP-led minority administration, with the support of Ian Borthwick, the sole independent member. John Alexander SNP group leader was also the Leader of Dundee City Council.
In a 2019 by-election, the SNP won a seat from Labour, giving it an overall majority. The SNP lost its majority again a few weeks later when Councillor Gregor Murray quit the party after accusing it of being transphobic. Shortly after this announcement, Councillor Murray was suspended from the council for two months by the Standards Commission for Scotland for using a "derogatory word" in an online forum which was judged to be "highly offensive and inappropriate". Murray, whose preferred gender pronouns are they/them, complained to the Scout Association of being misgendered by campaigner Maya Forstater during an online discussion about the Scouts' transgender policy. Although an initial investigation found against Forstater, the association subsequently apologised to Forstater, saying "it is clear you did not deliberately misgender the complainant".
At the 2022 election, the SNP regained their majority, gaining a seat in the West End ward which helped them reach the 15 seats needed to form a majority administration. The Liberal Democrats gained two seats whilst the Conservatives dropped to fourth, losing all but one of their seats on the council. The sole Alba representative, Alan Ross, who defected from the SNP was not returned.
The council has a history of Labour Party domination. George Galloway was leader for a time, and was responsible for organising Dundee's twinning with the Palestinian city of Nablus.
Elections.
Elections to the council are held every five years where voters elect three or four councillors to the eight multi-member wards across the city. The last election was held on 5 May 2022.
Independence referendum.
Dundee returned the highest proportion of Yes votes of any area in Scotland in the 2014 independence referendum, with 53,620 Yes votes to 39,880 No votes. It was among only four local authority areas that backed independence. In Summer 2014, First Minister Alex Salmond said Dundee was moving "towards being Scotland's Yes city", and it retained that designation in the run-up to the referendum. Housing schemes in Dundee canvassed by Yes activists indicated levels of support of up to 80 per cent in favour of independence.
Headlines were made in the final week of the campaign when a Better Together event in Dundee was crashed by a piper lead demonstration involving Yes activists and members of the Scottish Socialist Party, who marched from the event they were having in Albert Square to sing protest songs at Labour party representatives at the foot of Reform Street.
Scottish Parliament.
For elections to the Scottish Parliament (Holyrood) the city area is divided between two constituencies. The Dundee City East (Holyrood) constituency and the Dundee City West (Holyrood) constituency are entirely within the city area.
Both constituencies are within the North East Scotland electoral region. The region elects a total of ten first past the post constituency Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and seven additional members, to produce a form of proportional representation for the region as a whole.
Boundaries date from 1999, when the parliament itself was created.
Currently, Shona Robison (SNP) is MSP for the Dundee City East constituency and, Joe FitzPatrick (SNP) is MSP for the Dundee City West constituency.
Parliament of the United Kingdom.
For elections to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (Westminster), the city area is divided between the Dundee East (Westminster) constituency and the Dundee West (Westminster) constituency. These constituencies also include portions of the Angus council area.
Current boundaries date from 2005. Prior to the 2005 general election, the constituencies had the boundaries of now existing Scottish Parliament constituencies, with north-eastern and north-western portions of the city area being covered by the Angus (Westminster) constituency.
Currently, Stewart Hosie (Scottish National Party) is Member of Parliament (MP) for the Dundee East constituency, and Chris Law (Scottish National Party) is MP for the Dundee Central constituency.
Historic constituencies.
As a royal burgh, Dundee was represented as a component of the Perth Burghs constituency from 1708 to 1832, when the Dundee burgh constituency was created. In 1868 the burgh constituency became a two-member constituency.
East and West single-member constituencies have existed, with varying boundaries, since 1950.

Consumer Guidance Society of India

The Consumer Guidance Society of India (CGSI) is a nonprofit consumer organization established in India in 1966 to protect and educate the Indian consumer about sub-standard products and services, adulterated foods, short weights and measures, spurious and hazardous drugs, exorbitant prices, endemic shortages leading to black marketing and profiteering, unfulfilled manufacture guarantees, and a host of other problems.
History.
Since independence, India has been striving to develop and strengthen its industrial base. However, in this pursuit of "self-sufficiency", exploitation of consumers by manufacturers and service providers became rampant in India. In the 1960s, only a few monopolistic business houses controlled industry. In one infamous case, forty persons suffered dropsy and glaucoma after consuming groundnut oil adulterated with toxic argemone oil. The victims did not get any justice and the culprits escaped without punishment. This outrage energized nine women to organize a movement to fight for consumer rights and to form the CGSI in 1966.

CGSI has on date has about 3000 lifetime members spread all over India with all Managing Committee Members and office bearers at helm being volunteers.
Legal framework.
CGSI was the first consumer organization to demand a special consumer court for the redressal of consumers' complaints. In 1975, CGSI led a delegation of five consumer organizations from different parts of India to the then Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, Mr. T. A. Pai, and demanded for a comprehensive consumer protection act, special consumer courts, and a directorate for implementation of the act. 
CGSI's constant follow-up was instrumental in enacting the "Consumer Protection Act 1986" by the Government of India.
Consumer activities.
CGSI's important activities include: (1) consumer education (2) holding talks and exhibitions to spread consumer rights awareness among urban poor and rural areas (3) consumer complaints redressal (4) testing of consumer products (5) publication of "KEEMAT" a bi-monthly news magazine now published for over 20 years having articles of general consumer awareness, for CGSI members and general public.
Consumer education for schools and colleges.
CGSI's Education Committee members had been working with other likeminded educationists to introduce formal Consumer Education in the school curriculum. After two years of meetings and discussions, CGSI efforts bore fruit. In 1994, the Maharashtra Education Board introduced Consumer Education at the (9th) Ninth Standard Level, progressively covering students from the (4th) Forth Standard upwards. The subject taught are the Consumer Moment, Rights &amp; Responsibilities of Consumers, the Consumer in the Market Place, Food Adulteration, Weights and Measures, Environment protection, etc. These topics included under the existing subjects like Civics, Economics and Home science, are project-based, and more practical in nature than theoretical or examination oriented.
Consumer education.
CGSI conducts programs and educates consumers in various topics, such as:
Consumer education project for rural consumers.
CGSI started a rural project in the villages of Thane and Raigad districts (Maharashtra) in 1997, with a staff of six and funding from Action Aid. By 1999, CGSI had given consumer training to consumers in 112 villages. Over 32,300 people have received consumer education through 750 talks and demonstrations in the 2 years of the project, 107 training programs were organized and special training in consumer activism given to 5,767 potential activists. Many local consumer groups have been set up in different areas by the consumers themselves that are now actively organizing exhibitions, holding talks and redressing complaints. In the years 2005–06 and 2006–07, CGSI conducted consumer clubs in 25 schools each in Thane &amp; Raigad District with the help of Maharashtra State Government. CGSI trained a total of 2500 students and teachers in the subject of consumer awareness.
Complaint redressal.
CGSI handles consumer complaints and offers legal guidance to those wishing to file suits in the Consumer Courts. In cases where there are a larger number of complaints against a particular party, both sides are brought together to resolve the issue. The CGSI'S Complaints Committee meets twice a week. CGSI has redressed many thousands of consumer grievances over the years, with 70-80% success in favour of the consumers. complaints cover medical/surgical malpractice and negligence; insurance non-payment; sub-standard drugs and medicines; home remedies; defective household appliances; poor quality foods and drinks; misleading advertising claims; and grievances concerning investments, real estate, insurance, telephones, electricity supply, etc. CGSI handled over 400 complaints during the year through personal counseling sessions, correctly guiding complainants, sometimes even clearly saying that they do not have a case to fight for without wrongfully leading them on.
Product testing.
As early as 1977, CGSI established formal product testing to evaluate quality by drawing samples directly from the market without involving the manufacturers in the testing process. Test results were a revelation for quality control regulatory authorities. It first assessed the safety and performance of domestic pressure stoves and found that two-thirds of the samples tested failed in safety parameters. CGSI sent the results to the government and Indian Standards Institution (ISI) now Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), with a demand for mandatory certification. In 1986, with the passing of the Pressure Stoves Quality Control Order, ISI Certification for pressure stoves became mandatory. Subsequently, CGSI did tests on electrical appliances and fittings - irons, immersion heaters, culminating in the enactment of the Household Electrical Appliances (Quality Control) Order. CGSI has developed a food adulteration testing kit and a milk adulteration testing kit for use by the lay consumers. Many other products were tested and reports published in the society's monthly Journal, "KEEMAT": edible oils, powdered spices, 'surma' (kohl), geysers, clinical thermometers, plastic water bottles, rubber teats, milk, mineral water, breads, soft drinks, bath soaps, fabric detergents, and toothpastes.
Publications.
"KEEMAT", India's first monthly consumer magazine is now in its 43rd year of publications. CGSI distributes "KEEMAT" to all its members. "KEEMAT" is also available as a free download to the public from dedicated CGSI website www.cgsiindia.org. CGSI has also produced a number of consumer guides on subjects like electrical appliances, edible oils, pesticides, food, adulteration, safety at home, safe blood, etc.
National award.
In 1991, CGSI received the National Award for Consumer Protection for its 25th year for service to consumers. CGSI hopes to reach out to more and more consumers in the new millennium and to developed newer and more effective methods of serving consumers interest.
CGSI Representation in various bodies.
Various government statutory bodies like the Bureau of Indian Standards, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Authority of India, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, Consumer Advisory Committee of Various Industries, etc., give representation to CGSI due to its dedicated work force and expertise at its disposal. Lately, the Maharashtra State Government has given representation to CGSI in its prestigious Maharashtra State Consumer Protection Council.
Effective September 2011, the Maharashtra state government has entrusted CGSI to establish and manage the Maharashtra state consumer helpline.
Considering CGSI's experience in consumer rights protection, the Maharashtra State Government has awarded consumer helpline project to CGSI since September 2011 on five years contract. The main objectives are as follows:
Consumers can call a dedicated toll-free number or send e-mail to seek information, advice, or guidance for their day-to-day consumer problems.
Under this project, counselors have guided nearly 20,000 aggrieved consumers in 2013–14. Maharashtra is among the top two states in terms of number of complains handled amongst nine states conducting consumer helpline project.
CGSI's documentary film "Grahakpal" on consumer rights.
CGSI has produced a documentary film "Grahakpal" on consumer rights by roping a few celebrities to spread the message of consumer rights awareness. The film is screened at various seminars conducted by CGSI resulting in the helpline message reaching to nearly 16,000 viewers in a year, majority of the viewers are college and school students who need to be responsible and aware consumers when they enter mainstream after completing their studies.
Mediation &amp; Counselling Clinic
Mr. Girish Bapat, Cabinet Minister for Consumer Protection, Government of Maharashtra and Mr. Arun Deshpande, Chairman, Consumer Welfare Advisory Committee, Maharashtra on October 20, 2015 inaugurated the 'Mediation and Conciliation Clinic' that primarily aims to resolve cases pertaining to consumer disputes.
Landmark achievements.
With the number of queries and requests increasing steadily, and the eagerness to cover more and more consumers, CGSI is also conducting educational seminars in other states like Bihar, Jharkhand and Delhi apart from Maharashtra. During the last few years, CGSI is conducting nearly 250 seminars each on Telecom, Banking, Financial Awareness, Food Safety etc. CGSI has ambitious targets to reach more and more consumers through its consumer education programs and make India, a country of aware consumers resulting in flourishing markets with quality products and services.

Superman logo

The Superman shield, also known as the Superman logo, Superman symbol, or Superman S, is the iconic emblem for the fictional DC Comics superhero Superman. As a representation of one of the first superheroes, it served as a template for character design decades after Superman's first appearance. The tradition of wearing a representative symbol on the chest was followed by many subsequent superheroes, including Batman, Spider-Man, Green Lantern, the Flash, Wonder Woman, Hawkman, and many others.
In its current form, the logo is a red capital "S" inside a pentagonal yellow stylized shield with a red border. In earlier Superman stories, "S" was simply an initial for "Superman", but in the 1978 film, it was portrayed as the family crest of the House of El, the family of Superman.
Evolution of the symbol.
In its original inception in "Action Comics" #1, Superman's symbol was a letter "S" with red and blue on a yellow police badge symbol that resembled a shield. The symbol was first changed a few issues later in "Action Comics" #7. The shield varied over the first few years of the comics, and many times was nothing more than an inverted triangle with an "S" inside of it.
The shield first became a diamond in the Fleischer Studios animated serial "Superman". It was black with a red "S" outlined with white (or occasionally with yellow). The "S" has varied in size and shape and the diamond shape containing it has also changed size and shape. Extreme examples of this would be the very large logo on the Dean Cain costume from the television series "" and the comparatively small version of the shield as depicted in the 2006 film "Superman Returns". It has, in most incarnations, retained its original color, while changing shape here and there. The classic logo is the basis for virtually all other interpretations of the logo.
In the mid-1990s, when Superman's costume and powers changed briefly, during the "Superman Red/Superman Blue" comic book storylines, the shield changed colors and slightly changed shape, in accordance with the changes in the costume. In 1992's 75th edition of Vol 2, the logo is shown soaked in blood, depicting Superman's death. In "Superman" #123, Superman's new powers force him to find a suit capable of containing his new abilities. The effective material found to create Superman's suit, along with being blue and silver, was also courtesy of Lex Luthor. Not only did the colors and powers change, the logo also evolved into a re-imagined "electric" emblem. In the miniseries "Kingdom Come", an aged Superman sported an "S"–like symbol against a black background in a red pentagon.
In the 2000s television series "Smallville", the "S" symbol originally appeared as a diamond with a vertical infinity symbol (to be similar to the "S"), in an attempt to make it seem more alien. However, beginning with the sixth-season episode "Zod", Clark Kent is given a crystal bearing the "S" logo in the style of the "Superman Returns" logo. The logo also appeared in the first episode of the series, when the students captured Clark by giving him a kryptonite necklace and tied him to a cross-like beam in a cornfield and painted a red 'S' (short for Scarecrow) on Clark's chest.
Symbol evolution.
Some of the symbols used by Superman through the years are:
Representations.
Initially, the S-shield had one meaning: "S" for Superman. One of the first alternative meanings was presented in "Superman: The Movie", in which it was not an "S", but rather the "S"-shaped Coat of arms of the House of El. Marlon Brando, who portrayed Jor-El, conceived the idea of the "S" being a family crest, from which folklore spun off. In the Superman reboot story "The Man of Steel", the logo was designed by Jonathan Kent and derived from an ancient Native American symbol. It was featured on a medicine blanket given to an ancestor of the Kent family by a Native American tribe after he helped to cure them of a plague. The symbol was supposed to represent a snake, an animal held to possess healing powers by the tribe, and thus would imply that, by wearing this symbol, Superman was a metaphorical healer. This origin was also included in the 1997 Superman encyclopedia.
In 2004, Mark Waid's "" series stated that the S-Shield is the Kryptonian symbol for "hope" and Superman believes it may have begun as a coat of arms for the House of El. Later, writer Geoff Johns confirmed it was indeed a coat of arms, as well as a symbol for hope. In the 2013 film "Man of Steel", Jor-El mentions that the symbol represents the House of El and means "hope", and Superman later also specifies that it is not an "S" when Lois Lane asks what the "S" was short for. Superman further explains that the design is based on a river in the 2017 film "Justice League".
In "Supergirl", Kara Danvers states that the Kryptonian symbol stands for her family's motto, "Stronger together."
House of El.
Marv Wolfman's novelization of the film "Superman Returns" depicts the symbol as belonging to one of the three primary houses of Krypton that brought peace to the planet after a civil uprising, a serpent coiled inside a shield, a warning not to return to the ways of violence and deception. The shield has since been taken as a coat of arms, resulting in Jor-El's continued presence in the council despite his "mad" findings. The other two are merely described, including Pol-Us' eye of vigilance and Kol-Ar's open hand of truth and justice.
Cape.
In almost all versions, Superman's red cape has an all-yellow version of the logo, with a thin black line separating the areas. A notable exception is in "", where the logo was absent from Superman's cape. This was due to the difficulty in animating the S on the flowing cape. In the 2006 film "Superman Returns", the logo appeared on the belt buckle in reverse colors (yellow diamond and S with red background pieces) instead of on Superman's cape. The logo is also absent from Superman's cape in the 2013 film "Man of Steel" due to the difficulty of animating a cape with the logo in CGI shots. In the 2011 reboot of the comic book series, on his cape is a black pentagon and S with a red background piece.
Variants.
In the 1960s the tiny bottle city of Kandor, the miniaturized capital city of the planet Krypton, resided in Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Originally, certain inhabitants resembling Kal-El formed the Superman Emergency Squad and would, on occasion, leave the bottle, enter the Earth's atmosphere and gain super powers to aid Superman. As designed by artist Curt Swan, their uniforms were similar to that of Superman save for the 'S' on their chests which resembled the early version, the 'S' and border in red on a yellow field, but in an elongated triangle.
During the "Reign of the Supermen" story arc, Each of the four different Supermen was represented by a variant of the symbol, which each wore on their person. 
Other variations include:
Wearers of the shield.
Kryptonian family members of Superman wear the symbol, but sometimes it is worn to honor Superman. After "The Death of Superman", many DC Comics superheroes wore a black armband with the Superman logo.
Diamond and eight shield.
In the television series "Smallville", an octagonal silver metallic key is used in the Kawatche caves, as well as in a transport device used to travel to the Fortress of Solitude. Along the edges are imprinted Kryptonian characters, one of which is the diamond border of the Superman shield with a figure 8 inside of the diamond instead of the S. The 8-shield is later described as being from an ancient form of the Kryptonian language (in the Kryptonian alphabet employed in the 2004 storyline "The Supergirl from Krypton", it corresponds to the letter S), while the modern symbol is the familiar S-shield. The familiar S-shield is seen in season 9. It is used as Clark Kent's calling card in his vigilante actions in Metropolis. Clark, known as the Blur, burns the sign using his heat vision in various places throughout the city. In the season 9 episode "Rabid", Clark mentions while talking to Oliver Queen that the mark "gives people hope."

Eupatorium cannabinum

Eupatorium cannabinum, commonly known as hemp-agrimony, is a herbaceous plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a robust perennial native to Europe, Northwestern Africa, Turkey, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, the Caucasus and Central Asia, and grows in damp to wet habitats (also rarely on dry soils), usually in lowlands but known up to 410 m altitude in Britain. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant and occasionally found as a garden escape in scattered locations in China, the United States and Canada. It is extremely attractive to butterflies, much like buddleia.
If the genus "Eupatorium" is defined in a restricted sense (about 42 species), "E. cannabinum" is the only species of that genus native to Europe, with the remainder in Asia or North America.
Description.
"Eupatorium cannabinum" is a perennial herb up to tall forming extensive clumps, with the reddish stems covered in small hairs. The leaves are opposite, deeply 3-lobed, occasionally 5-lobed, and have serrated margins. It is dioecious, with racemes of mauve flower heads which are pollinated by insects from July to early September. The flowers are visited by many types of insects, and have a generalised pollination syndrome. The flower heads are composed of dense clusters of 2–5 mm long florets of fluffy appearance, and can be pink or purple, or rarely whitish. The fruit is an achene about 2 or 3 mm long, borne by a pappus with hairs 3 to 5 mm long, which is distributed by the wind. The plant over-winters as a hemicryptophyte.
Taxonomy.
Two subspecies are accepted by some authorities, but are not considered distinct by the Plants of the World Online database:
Toxicity.
"Eupatorium cannabinum" contains tumorigenic pyrrolizidine alkaloids. The alkaloids may be present in the plant material as their N-oxides.
Folk medicine.
"E. cannabinum", known locally by the Nepali names of "Banmara" and "Kalijhar", is used as a styptic in the folk medicine of the Indian state of Sikkim in the Eastern Himalayas (to which the plant is not native, but an introduction).
The leaves and tender stems are crushed fresh and the juice is applied to cuts and bruises. Sometimes, when the wound is large, the squeezed remains of the plant are placed over the wound in the form of a poultice. The bleeding stops immediately and the wound is protected from infection.

Takemoto-za

The Takemoto-za () was a "bunraku" theatre in Osaka, founded in 1684 by Takemoto Gidayū. Plays by many famous playwrights were performed there, including works by Chikamatsu Monzaemon, Namiki Sōsuke, and Takeda Izumo I. Many of the playwrights working at the Takemoto-za worked together, as a committee, as was the custom at the time.
The Takemoto-za had a fierce rival in the Toyotake-za, built by one of Takemoto Gidayū's former disciples.
Though "bunraku" remained exceptionally popular through 1764, at that time it began to be eclipsed by kabuki and to fall into decline. The Takemoto-za was forced to close in 1767, and though it opened once more after that, it soon afterwards closed again.

Gaito Gazdanov

Gaito Gazdanov ; ; 5 December 1971) was a Russian émigré writer of Ossetian descent, who lived in Paris. Gazdanov's first stories were published in France in 1926 in Russian. His novels "An Evening with Claire" (1929) and "The Spectre of Alexander Wolf" (1948) became his most well-known works, mentioned by writers Maxim Gorky, Ivan Bunin and Vladislav Khodasevich. Gazdanov was a member of the French Resistance in occupied France. In 1953, he joined Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as an editor. Although he learned perfect French whilst living in France, Gazdanov continued writing stories in Russian.
Biography.
Georgii Ivanovich Gazdanov (; ) was born in 1903 in Saint Petersburg but was brought up in Siberia and Ukraine, where his father worked as a forester. His father was from Ossetia, a North Caucasian region within the Russian Empire. He took part in the Russian Civil War on the side of Wrangel's White Army. In 1920, he left Russia and settled in Paris, where he was employed in the Renault factories. His early short stories and novels dealt with this Russian experience. But by the mid-1930s, the years in Paris turned Gazdanov's themes toward life, Russian or French, in France. Later, he earned his living as a taxicab driver. Gazdanov can be regarded as a White émigré. He died in Munich in 1971.
Gazdanov's first novel — "An Evening with Claire" (1929) — won accolades from Maxim Gorky and Vladislav Khodasevich, who noted his indebtedness to Marcel Proust. In "Black Swans", a 1930 short story, the protagonist commits suicide because he has no chance of moving to Australia, which he imagines to be an idealised paradise of graceful black swans. On the strength of his first short stories, Gazdanov was described by critics as one of the most gifted writers to begin his career in emigration.
Gazdanov's mature work was produced after World War II. He tried to write in a new genre, "metaphysical thrillers". His mastery of criminal plots and understanding of psychological detail is evident in his two most popular novels, "The Spectre of Alexander Wolf" and "The Return of the Buddha", whose English translations appeared in 1950 and 1951. The writer "excels in creating characters and plots in which cynicism and despair remain in precarious yet convincing balance with a courageous acceptance of life and even a certain "joie de vivre"." 
In 1953, Gazdanov joined Radio Liberty, where he hosted a program about Russian literature (under the name of Georgi Cherkasov) until his death of lung cancer in 1971.
Gazdanov's works were never published in the Soviet Union. After several decades of oblivion, starting in the 1990s more than fifty editions of his works, including a three-volume collection (1998) followed by a five-volume collection (2009, ed. by T.N. Krasavchenko) were finally published in post-Soviet Russia. The Ossetian artistic community, led by Valery Gergiev, had a new tombstone placed at his grave in Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois. The annual Gazdanov Readings are held to discuss his literary heritage.

<doc id="6991222" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6991222" title="Sewadjare Mentuhotep">
Sewadjare Mentuhotep

Sewadjare Mentuhotep (also known as Mentuhotep V or Mentuhotep VI depending on the scholar) is a poorly attested Egyptian pharaoh of the late 13th Dynasty, who reigned for a short time c. 1655 BC during the Second Intermediate Period. The Egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker respectively believe that he was the fiftieth and forty-ninth king of the dynasty, thereby making him Mentuhotep V. Thus, Sewadjare Mentuhotep most likely reigned shortly before the arrival of Hyksos over the Memphite region and concurrently with the last rulers of the 14th Dynasty.
Name.
Ryholt, Baker and Jacques Kinnaer refer to Sewadjare Mentuhotep as Mentuhotep V because they believe that he lived at the very end of the 13th Dynasty. On the other hand, in his studies of the Second Intermediate Period, Jürgen von Beckerath leaves Sewadjare Mentuhotep's position within the 13th Dynasty completely undetermined, but names him Mentuhotep VI nonetheless.
Attestations.
Sewadjare Mentuhotep is a poorly attested pharaoh. Unfortunately, the Turin canon is severely damaged after the record of Sobekhotep VII and the identity and chronological order of the last nineteen kings of the 13th Dynasty are impossible to ascertain from the document. According to Nobert Dautzenberg and Ryholt, Mentuhotep's prenomen "Sewadjare" is nonetheless partially preserved on column 8, line 20 of the papyrus, which reads "[...]dj[are]".
The only contemporary attestation safely attributable to Sewadjare Mentuhotep V is a single fragment of a relief showing his cartouches. The relief was found in the ruins of the mortuary temple of Mentuhotep II during the excavation of Édouard Naville at the beginning of the 20th century.
Coffin of Herunefer.
Another possible attestation of Sewedjare Mentuhotep V is given by a fragment of a wooden coffin, now in the British Museum under the catalog number BM EA 29997. The coffin bears the following text: 
The prenomen of the king Mentuhotep is missing and the identification of this Mentuhotep remains problematic. Kim Ryholt notes however that the coffin is also inscribed with an early version of passages of the Book of the Dead, which is one of only two pre-New Kingdom inscriptions of this text. Thus, Ryholt argues that this Mentuhotep must have reigned during the late Second Intermediate Period. Thus, three kings could possibly be the one mentioned on the coffin: Seankhenre Mentuhotepi, Merankhre Mentuhotep VI and Sewadjare Mentuhotep. Although it sounds similar to Mentuhotep, Ryholt has shown that Mentuhotepi is a different name than Mentuhotep and would therefore not have been reported as Mentuhotep. To decide between the two remaining kings, Ryholt notes that the other instance of the Book of the Dead is found on the coffin of queen Mentuhotep, wife of Djehuti, the second pharaoh of the 16th Dynasty who reigned c. 1645 BC. In this case, the text is almost identical to that found on Herunefer's coffin, which argues for a close proximity in time between the two. While Sewadjare Mentuhotep reigned c. 10 years before Djehuti, Merankhre Mentuhotep is believed to have reigned 60 years after him. Hence, Ryholt concludes that Sewadjare Mentuhotep is the Mentuhotep of the coffin, Sitmut his queen and Herunefer his son.
This identification is far from certain however, and Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton have instead dated the coffin to the end of the 16th dynasty, thereby giving Herunefer as the son of Merankhre Mentuhotep VI.

Vanity 6 (album)

Vanity 6 is the 1982 debut and only studio album by American vocal girl group Vanity 6 released on Warner Bros. Records. The group had been created by Prince as an outlet for his prolific song writing. All three women in the group (Vanity, Brenda Bennett, Susan Moonsie) shared lead and background vocals. As was typical for Prince's side projects, he obscured his virtually complete responsibility for the production, songwriting, and instrumental performances by arbitrarily attributing the credits to other members of his musical stable or the fictional "The Starr Company". "If a Girl Answers (Don't Hang Up)" was co-written with The Time member Terry Lewis and "Bite the Beat" was co-written with Jesse Johnson.
"Nasty Girl" was featured in the 1984 blockbuster film "Beverly Hills Cop".
"He's So Dull" was written by Dez Dickerson and can be heard briefly in the 1983 film "National Lampoon's Vacation". The "other woman" rap on the song "If a Girl Answers (Don't Hang Up)" is performed by Prince in an effected voice whose resemblance to that of The Time's lead singer Morris Day has sometimes led to Day being misidentified as the performer.
The album was originally released on August 11, 1982 by Warner Bros. Records on LP and cassette. A compact disc was issued in September 1988. All three formats are now out of print. Vinyl copies of the album were pressed with "Side 1" and "Side 6" on the label. Reviewing the album in "The Village Voice", Robert Christgau wrote, "All eight of these dumb, dancy little synth tunes get me off when I let my guard down, and most of them are funny, hooky, and raunchy at the same time." The album was later certified gold by the RIAA in 1983 a year after its release due in large part to the smash success of Prince's "1999". This would be the only album released by Vanity 6.

The total length of the expressway will be , of which is in operation, with planned. The R7 will be concurrent with the European road E575 on the section from Bratislava to Dunajská Streda.
Route description.
The R7 starts in Bratislava and will end near Lučenec. The route starts in Bratislava in an intersection with the D1 motorway, and it continues through its other intersection with the D4 motorway and around the towns of Dunajská Streda, Nové Zámky, Veľký Krtíš and Lučenec, where it ends in an intersection with the R2 expressway. Along with the R8 expressway it is the only expressway whose route is not even partially based on plans from before 1989. With the current intentions of the Ministry of Transport, the completion of the entire expressway cannot be expected before 2050.
Chronology.
Plans for the R7 date back to the 1990s, after independence from Czechoslovakia a two-lane express road was envisaged. The preparation of the project was approved by the Slovak Government on the 26 June 2003. In October 2005, a comprehensive technical study was prepared, followed by the preparation of documents and variant solutions for routing individual sections for environmental impact assessment. The opinions for the first sections were issued by the Slovak Ministry of Environment in May 2009.
The western part of the R7 was part of a PPP project awarded to Spanish construction company Cintra on 1 February 2016. On 20 May 2016, the concession contract was signed, and a financial close was reached on 22 June 2016, covering the construction of of the R7 between Bratislava and Holice. The contract also included construction of the D4 around Bratislava.
Construction began on 24 October 2016 with the ceremonial stone tapping in the presence of the Minister of Transport Árpád Érsek. The first two sections from the Bratislava-South intersection (D4xR7) to Holice were opened on the 19 July 2020.

Cadillac Palace Theatre

The Cadillac Palace Theatre (originally the New Palace Theatre) is operated by Broadway In Chicago, a Nederlander company and seats 2,344. It is located at 151 West Randolph Street in the Chicago Loop area. Opened in 1926 and designed largely in the French Baroque style, it is connected to the historic Eitel Brothers' Bismarck Hotel (Allegro Royal), and was for a time known as the Bismarck Theatre. Cadillac has held the naming rights since 1999.
History.
The theater opened in 1926 as the New Palace Theatre with Roger Wolfe Kahn and his Orchestra topping the bill. It was built at a cost of $12 million as part of the Eitel Block Project. In the 1960s, the theater was renamed the Bismarck Theatre and later turned into a rock venue. In 1999, it was renovated and renamed the Cadillac Palace Theatre after Cadillac purchased naming rights. It currently has a maximum capacity of 2,344 people. Since this reopening, it has been home to many pre-broadway hits. Broadway In Chicago has allowed for more Broadway hits to tour through Chicago, causing a great economic impact on the city of Chicago.
Architecture.
The Rapp Brothers, George and Cornelius, were responsible for the design of the Cadillac Palace Theatre. The two men were also the architects behind the Nederlander Theatre and the Chicago Theatre, as well as dozens of other theaters around the country. Their inspiration for the look and feel of the Palace Theatre came from the Fontainebleau and the Palace of Versailles, both found in France. The interior includes huge decorative mirrors, breche violet and white marble. The walls inside are adorned with gold leafing and wood decorations, as well as a series of complex arches and detailed brass ornamentation.
Restoration.
During World War II the United States government went around to most theaters and confiscated all the brass which it recycled for war materials. At the time, the owners of the Palace Theatre painted all the brass in the theater white, so that when the government came in, they were tricked into thinking the theater contained no brass. The brass was left this way and generally forgotten until the recent renovation, when the paint was removed and the rare brass ornamentation was rediscovered and restored to its original condition.
General interest.
The theater opened as part of vaudeville's Orpheum Circuit. As part of the Orpheum Circuit, the theater presented such stars as Jimmy Durante, Mae West, Jack Benny, Sophie Tucker, and Bob Hope. After the loss of interest in vaudeville, the theater was converted into a movie palace in 1931.
Notable productions.
The Cadillac Palace became home to pre-Broadway tours and world premieres with the opening of Elton John and Tim Rice's "Aida" in the autumn of 1999. This was the beginning of many Broadway-caliber shows to pass through the Cadillac Palace. Mel Brooks's "The Producers" premiered in Chicago starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick in February 2001. In October 2006 "The Pirate Queen" made its premiere. Oprah Winfrey presents "The Color Purple" sat down for its long-run from April to September 2007. In March 2009, the national tour of Mary Poppins began its premier engagement at the Cadillac Palace. Shrek The Musical launched its national tour there from July 13-September 5, 2010. Beginning December 1, 2010, "Wicked" played a limited return engagement on its first national tour, playing through January 23, 2011.

Phagolysosome

In biology, a phagolysosome, or endolysosome, is a cytoplasmic body formed by the fusion of a phagosome with a lysosome in a process that occurs during phagocytosis. Formation of phagolysosomes is essential for the intracellular destruction of microorganisms and pathogens. It takes place when the phagosome's and lysosome's membranes 'collide', at which point the lysosomal contents—including hydrolytic enzymes—are discharged into the phagosome in an explosive manner and digest the particles that the phagosome had ingested. Some products of the digestion are useful materials and are moved into the cytoplasm; others are exported by exocytosis.
Membrane fusion of the phagosome and lysosome is regulated by the Rab5 protein, a G protein that allows the exchange of material between these two organelles but prevents complete fusion of their membranes.
When the phagosome and lysosome interact with one another, they form a fully developed phagolysosome. A fully developed phagolysosome consists of digestive and aseptic properties. The purpose of phagolysosomes is to act as a protective barrier. It is a defense line that kills pathogenic bacteria that may have slipped through detection of the other immune system cells. The extracellular space that surrounds the lysosome is very acidic which is important for degradation because most cells cannot handle an acidic environment and will die, with an exception of a few.
Function.
Phagolysosomes function by reducing the pH of their internal environment. The phagolysosome becomes increasingly acidic through the action of V-ATPase proton pumps, reaching a pH as low as 4.5-5.0. This acidic environment is essential for the activation of hydrolytic enzymes and the denaturation of microbial proteins. This serves as a defense mechanism against microbes and other harmful parasites and also provides a suitable medium for degradative enzyme activity.
Microbes are destroyed within phagolysosomes by a combination of oxidative and non-oxidative processes. The oxidative process, also known as respiratory burst includes the "non-mitochondrial" production of reactive oxygen species.
By lowering pH and concentrations of sources of carbon and nitrogen, phagolysomes inhibit growth of fungi. An example is the inhibition of hyphae in "Candida albicans".
In human neutrophils, the phagolysosomes destroy pathogens also by producing hypochlorous acid. 
Stages of Phagocytosis and Phagolysosome Formation.
Phagocytosis and phagolysosome formation can be broken down into several discrete stages, each involving specific cellular processes and molecular players:
The fate of the digested material can vary. It may be killed through apoptosis, further engulfed by macrophages, or presented to T-cells to induce an immune reaction. 
Interestingly, some proteins are involved in multiple stages of this process, indicating mechanistic overlap between these seemingly discrete steps. The entire process is regulated by conserved proteins involved in recognizing, engulfing, and processing extracellular debris.
Research using model organisms, particularly Caenorhabditis elegans, has been instrumental in identifying the molecular players involved in these stages and ordering them into distinct pathways. C. elegans offers several advantages for studying phagocytosis, including the ability to observe the process in live animals with endogenous cargos in situ. The predictable timing of cell deaths and engulfment in C. elegans allows for time-lapse imaging of each step at the single-cell level. 
Phagolysosome Resolution.
Phagolysosome resolution is the final stage in the phagocytic process, involving the breakdown of engulfed material and the recycling of phagolysosomal components. Most studies do not image the process of phagocytosis to completion, instead using lysosome fusion or acidification of the phagolysosome lumen as endpoints. Additionally, this resolution stage is less well understood compared to earlier phases of phagocytosis, as it can take a significant amount of time. While engulfment and phagosome maturation can occur in minutes, degradation of phagolysosomal cargo can take hours to complete. 
Process of Resolution
After phagosome-lysosome fusion, the process of resolution can occur. Degradation begins with the breakdown of the cargo membrane to expose the cargo contents to lysosomal hydrolases. Lysosomal lipases are thought to target the cargo membrane while leaving the phagolysosomal membrane intact, possibly due to protection by glycosylated lysosomal membrane proteins. However, the exact mechanism by which lipases distinguish between these membranes remains unclear. 
Once the cargo membrane is compromised, lysosomal proteases and nucleases, such as the cathepsin protease CPL-1 and the DNase II homolog NUC-1, degrade the phagolysosomal cargo proteins and nucleic acids. The resulting breakdown products, including amino acids, are then transported out of the phagolysosome by various transporters, including members of the solute carrier family like SLC-36.1 and the SLC66A1 ortholog LAAT-1. 
The transport of breakdown products out of the phagolysosome serves multiple cellular functions. In immune cells, this process is crucial for antigen presentation, enabling the cell to communicate information about the degraded material to other components of the immune system. Additionally, the breakdown of phagolysosomal contents may contribute to cellular metabolism. The resulting molecules can serve as raw materials and energy sources for various cellular processes, potentially including the facilitation of subsequent rounds of phagocytosis. This efficient recycling of engulfed material highlights the phagolysosome's role not only in cellular defense but also in nutrient acquisition and energy management. 
Membrane Dynamics 
Recent time-lapse studies have revealed dynamic changes in phagolysosomal membranes during resolution. Within an hour of cargo membrane breakdown, the phagolysosome begins to tubulate and release vesicles. This process depends on the small GTPase ARL-8, which is associated with kinesin microtubule motor proteins. The released phagolysosomal vesicles play dual roles: they promote further degradation of cargo molecules and contribute to the reformation of lysosomes by retrieving lysosomal hydrolases and membrane proteins. 
Signaling and Regulation
The export of degraded phagolysosomal contents, particularly amino acids, plays a crucial role in regulating phagolysosome resolution. Amino acid transport by proteins such as SLC-36.1 and subsequent amino acid sensing lead to mTOR signaling, which is necessary for phagolysosome tubulation and vesicle release. However, the exact mechanism linking mTOR signaling to ARL-8-mediated tubulation is not yet fully understood. 
Importance for Cell Function
Phagolysosome resolution serves several important cellular functions:
Despite recent advances, many aspects of phagolysosome resolution remain to be elucidated, including the specificity of lipases in membrane breakdown, potential cytosolic repair mechanisms for the phagolysosomal membrane, and the precise regulation of ARL-8 in promoting tubulation versus whole organelle movement. 
Pathogens.
"Coxiella burnetii", the causative agent of Q fever, thrives and replicates in the acidic phagolysosomes of its host cell. The acidity of the phagolysosome is essential for "C.burnetii" to transport glucose, glutamate, and proline, as well as for its synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins.
Similarly, when in its amastigote stage, "Leishmania" obtains all its purine sources, various vitamins, and a number of its essential amino acids from the phagolysosome of its host. Leishmania also obtain heme from the proteolysis of proteins in the host phagolysosome.

Desmond Guinness

Desmond Walter Guinness (8 September 1931 – 20 August 2020) was an Anglo-Irish author of Georgian art and architecture, a conservationist and the co-founder of the Irish Georgian Society. He was the second son of the author and brewer Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne, and his then wife Diana Mitford (later Lady Mosley).
In 1958, he bought Leixlip Castle, Leixlip, County Kildare, Ireland, where he lived with both his first wife, Princess Henriette Marie-Gabrielle von Urach, generally known as Mariga, and later his second wife, the former Penelope Cuthbertson, whom he married in 1984.
Life.
Early life and marriage.
Born on 8 September 1931, Guinness was the second son of the author Bryan Guinness and Diana Mitford; his elder brother was Jonathan. Bryan succeeded as the 2nd Baron Moyne in November 1944. Desmond's mother divorced the then Bryan Guinness after five years and married the head of the British fascist Blackshirt movement, Oswald Mosley, in Berlin in 1936. Due to Mitford's interest in fascism, her father-in-law the 1st Baron had arranged for surveillance from 1935 onward, including by one of Guinness's governesses, and MI5 even noted a plan for her to visit Hitler with her sons. Mitford was interned in 1940, and Guinness later recalled visiting her in Holloway Prison when he was 10.
He was educated at Eton and Gordonstoun, and studied French and Italian at Christ Church, Oxford. After completing National Service, he moved to the estate of Lord Moyne, his father, near the Phoenix Park in Dublin, as Lord Moyne lived for six months a year in Ireland, and his mother had also moved to Ireland with Mosley, first living in Clonfert, then in Fermoy.
Guinness was married at Oxford in 1954 to Princess Henriette Marie-Gabrielle von Urach, daughter of "Fürst" Albrecht von Urach and a granddaughter of King Mindaugas II of Lithuania, who was generally known as "Mariga". Guinness bought Leixlip Castle and its residual 180-acre farm for £15,500, one third of his assets, in 1958, and he and his wife settled there.
Mariga Guinness moved to London alone in 1969, later lived in County Antrim, and later still returned to Leixlip Castle. The Guinnesses divorced in 1980, and Mariga died some years later.
Irish Georgian Society.
Desmond and Mariga founded the Irish Georgian Society in April 1958 to help to preserve Irish architecture of all periods. This was timely as the Irish planning laws were enacted only from 1963.
The IGS became involved in numerous projects and started publishing quarterly bulletins. Some early preservations or campaigns were at: Damer House (County Tipperary), The Conolly Folly (County Kildare), Mountjoy Square, Tailors' Hall and Hume Street (Dublin) and the Dromana Gateway in County Waterford.
The IGS also held Georgian cricket matches played to the rules of 1744.
Between 1967 and 1979 the Guinnesses bought and started to preserve Castletown House, in Celbridge, Kildare, said to be the finest Palladian house in Ireland.
Other philanthropic and social activities.
He was a member of Irish groups such as the Iveagh Trust, the CKAS, the RIAC and the Kildare Street &amp; University Club.
Later life.
In 1984, Guinness married Penelope Cuthbertson, daughter of the socialite Teresa Jungman, and a granddaughter of the artist Nico Wilhelm Jungmann.
In more recent years, Guinness founded a scholarship for students of architecture.
He was Master of the North Kildare Harriers. He stood down as President of the IGS in 1990.
Guinness died on 20 August 2020, at the age of 88.
Family.
The Guinnesses had a son, Patrick Desmond Carl-Alexander, and a daughter, Marina. Through Patrick he was a grandfather of the fashion model Jasmine Guinness. His daughter Marina is a patron of the arts and of Irish musicians including Glen Hansard, Damien Rice, and the band Kíla. Marina has three children of her own: Patrick (by Stewart Copeland of The Police), Violet (by photographer Perry Ogden), and Finbar (by record producer Denny Cordell).
There are no children from his second marriage.
His brother is Jonathan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne. He was the older half-brother (on his mother's side) of Max Mosley, former President of the FIA.
Recognition.
His conservation work has been recognised by many American and English cultural groups, and Europa Nostra. In 1980 he was made an honorary Doctor of Laws at Trinity College Dublin. In 2001 he was made an honorary member of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland and was awarded the gold medal of the Eire Society of Boston. He was a member of the Society of Dilettanti in London. In 2006 he was presented with a Europa Nostra award by the Queen of Spain. In 2010 he headed the Saint Patrick's Day parade in Seattle. In June 2014 he was awarded honorary lifetime membership of the Royal Dublin Society.

Barry Flanagan

Barry Flanagan OBE RA (11 January 1941 – 31 August 2009) was an Irish-Welsh sculptor. He is best known for his bronze statues of hares and other animals.
Biography.
Barry Flanagan was born on 11 January 1941 in Prestatyn, North Wales. From 1957-58, he studied architecture at Birmingham College of Art and Crafts. He studied sculpture at Saint Martin's School of Art in London from 1964 to 1966, and from 1967 to 1971 taught both at Saint Martin's and at the Central School of Art and Design.
He became an Irish citizen and lived in Dublin from 2000 to the year of his passing. Flanagan died on 31 August 2009, aged 68, from motor neurone disease in Santa Eulalia del Río, Ibiza, Spain.
He was the subject of a South Bank Show in 1983 directed by Don Featherstone and a biographical film by Peter Bach, "The Man Who Sculpted Hares: Barry Flanagan, A Life".
Works.
Castings of Flanagan's "Thinker on a Rock" are installed at Washington University in St. Louis, the John and Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park in Des Moines, Iowa, Utrecht, O’Connell Street in Dublin, the Philbrook Museum of Art, in Tulsa, OK, and the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden (Washington, D.C.)
Flanagan's hare statue, "Large Left-Handed Drummer", was on display in Union Square, Manhattan from 18 February to 24 June 2007.
Flanagan's 1993 "Large Mirror Nijinski", again with two hares, is displayed at the Skulpturen Park Köln, in Cologne.
Tate Britain held a retrospective show "Early Works 1965–1982" from September 2011 to January 2012. This exhibition contained many examples of his less well known pieces using materials such as cloth and rope, as well as some early bronze hare sculptures for which he gained renown.
At an exhibition held by Sotheby's at Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, in September–October 2012, fifteen of Flanagan's works were shown in a parkland setting. They included "Large Nijinski on Anvil Point" and "Nijinski Hare", placed at opposite ends of the Canal Pond. 
Flanagan donated a bronze horse statue, "San Marco Horse", to Jesus College, Cambridge in 2009. Prior to this, it had been on exhibition in the college since 1988.

FC Porto (basketball)

Futebol Clube do Porto (), commonly referred to as FC Porto, or simply Porto, is a Portuguese professional basketball team based in Porto. Created in 1926, it is the senior representative side of the basketball section of multi-sports club FC Porto. The team competes domestically in the Liga Portuguesa de Basquetebol (LPB) and internationally in FIBA Europe competitions, such as the Champions League and the FIBA Europe Cup.
The team plays its home matches at the Dragão Arena, alongside the club's handball and roller hockey teams, and is managed by Portuguese head coach and former club player Fernando Sá since 2022.
History.
Foundation.
The introduction of the sport in Portugal took place in 1913, and thirteen years later in 1926 a group of partners of the club decided to create a basketball team. António Sanches, António Marta and Daniel Barbosa drove the idea, having them joined by Gabriel Batista and A. Cabral to complete the team. The second place in the "Cup António Cardoso" guaranteed in the first season excites the community that forms immediately four other basketball teams. FC Porto basketball players trained in an outdoor field complex included in Campo da Constituição.
Early years.
The decades of the thirties and forties were not very fertile in securities for the basketball section of FC Porto, but still the sport was up solidifying a club that showed increasingly eclectic. In the year 1933, the first Campeonato de Portugal was played, and Porto participated alongside Conimbricense, Académico, Fluvial, Guifões, Sp. Braga, Atlético de Braga and Sporting de Gouveia. In 1940, FC Porto have played in a covered, lighted, on Avenida dos Aliados enclosure. The fruit came in late because in 1947–48 and 1949–50 FC Porto was national champion of the second division and two seasons later was national champion in the First Division in 1951–52 and 1952–53.
The 1990s achievements.
The year 1995 marks a crucial turning point in Portuguese basketball. It is in this year that the League Basketball Club, founded six years earlier, organized the first professional league. The FC Porto basketball section is associated with a sponsor at the time the UBP (going to be appointed FC Porto UBP), and enters with his right foot in the era of professional basketball, winning the first two editions of the league. Around the same time, the team moved to the Pavilhão Rosa Mota, which would provide better working conditions. In 1997 it is created the "FC Porto, Basquetbol, SAD", alongside "FC Porto Futebol, SAD". The president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa accumulated the presidency of both SADs and the club, while Fernando Gomes became the primary administrator.
Although nationally FC Porto is among the best title contenders in all competitions, their performance at the international level is modest, reflecting the position of the Portuguese Basketball against the other European and world federations. Their best European performance succeeded in 1997 and 2000, years that reached the quarter-finals of the FIBA Saporta Cup (in 1997 still called FIBA EuroCup). In between, in 1999, Paulo Pinto, then Porto player, was elected by FIBA as one of the 50 best players in Europe and, as such, included in the list of candidates to join the western selection EURO ALL STAR.
Recent years.
At the end of the 2011–12 season the responsible section informed the coaching staff, which was represented by head coach Moncho López, assistant coach Diogo Gomes, and players (captain Nuno Marçal, André Bessa and David Gomes attended) that the senior team would not compete in the major league championship after losing to Benfica at the Dragão Arena. A new project for the section which fielded players from the section's youth ranks was initiated, they started training under the designation Dragon Force who competed in the national championship CNB third division in season 2012/2013, participating in the final competition. The team secured promotion to the second-tier Proliga in 2013–14, winning that season's title in a playoff final against Illiabum.
Having earned the right to compete in the LPB, the club decided to remain in the Proliga for the 2014–15 season. The team defended their Proliga title without losing any match, and were promoted to the 2015–16 LPB. Competing again under the name of FC Porto, the team qualified for the championship playoffs and reached the final, where they beat the four-time defending champions Benfica to secure the club's 12th title.

Lyndale Park

Lyndale Park is a Minneapolis city park on the northeast side of Lake Harriet. It is next to Lakewood Cemetery, southeast of Bde Maka Ska. It is part of an enormous greenspace circling through Minneapolis called the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway, and is one of the seven districts within, called the Chain of Lakes. The other six districts within Grand Rounds are the Downtown Riverfront, Mississippi River, Minnehaha, Theodore Wirth, Victory Memorial Parkway, and Northeast. Managed by the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, the parkway system has numerous parks and parkways, lakes (22 within the city limits), streams and creeks, the Mississippi River, and the high Minnehaha Falls. The park system is designed so that every home in Minneapolis is within six blocks of green space.
Lyndale Park is and contains four gardens; the Peace Garden, the Rose Garden, the Perennial Garden, and the Perennial Trial Garden. Immediately adjacent to the Peace Garden is the Thomas Sadler Roberts Bird Sanctuary.
Arboretum.
The park's arboretum was conceived by Theodore Wirth in 1907 and by 1915 the bulk of the collection had been planted. Many of the original plantings still survive. Major collections include roses and crabapple trees. Heritage trees, defined as the oldest or largest specimen found within the city limits, include the Cucumber Magnolia, River Birch, Golden Larch, Mugo Pine, White Fir, Austrian Pine, Japanese Yew, and Wafer Ash.
Rose Gardens.
This is the second oldest public rose garden in the United States and was designed by the Park Superintendent Theodore Wirth. It is in size and at peak season the garden can contain as many as 60,000 blooms. Construction of the garden occurred during 1907-08. An official AARS (All America Rose Selections) test rose garden was added in 1946. The garden features more than 4000 plants and 250 species. Two fountains border the garden; the bronze-and-marble Heffelfinger Fountain is from the Villa Montalto near Florence, Italy and donated to the Park Board by Frank Heffelfinger in 1944. There is a cherub surfing on a dolphin at the top, surrounded by satyrs. Human faces on the pedestal base show the progress of age.
Annual-Perennial Garden and Perennial Trial Garden.
This garden was built in 1962-63 when the Phelps (turtle) fountain was moved from the downtown Gateway to the east end of this garden. Two long perennial borders edge this garden and six annual beds are featured between these borders. Many wedding ceremonies are performed in this garden area located between the Phelps and Heffelfinger fountains.
The Perennial Trial Garden is a recent addition to the Lyndale Park, and features perennials that are tested over several seasons for hardiness, disease resistance and other features. Maintained by the volunteers from the Men's Garden Club of Minneapolis, this garden is a meandering border that begins near King's Highway and follows the wood line down towards the Peace Garden. This perennial trial garden is planted in the area once occupied by an elaborate perennial border that was first installed in 1925 and later abandoned in the 1960s.
Thomas Sadler Roberts Bird Sanctuary.
Primarily a sanctuary for migratory songbirds in the spring, the warblers are the primary attraction. The Minnesota Audubon Society offers free tours every Tuesday at 9a during April and May. It is also a quiet and peaceful nature walk in the midst of the city. The main entrance to the sanctuary is in the Lyndale Park Gardens parking lot, and trails through that back of the Peace Garden. Named for Thomas Sadler Roberts, M.D., D.Sc. (1858–1946), Founding Member of the Minneapolis Young Naturalists Society, and the American Ornithologists' Union, and member of the Minnesota Ornithologists' Union.
Lyndale Farmstead Park.
Another park with a similar name, Lyndale Farmstead Park, is a separate park located between West 38th Street and West 40th Street on Bryant Avenue South. Lyndale Farmstead Park contains a recreation center and the Theodore Wirth house, Theodore Wirth House-Administration Building. The house is on the National Register of Historic Places.
Image gallery Arboretum.
North of the arboretum is the Peace Garden. In 1998 the rock garden was formally renamed the Lyndale Park Peace Garden.

Arthur D. Simons

Arthur D. "Bull" Simons (June 28, 1918 – May 21, 1979) was a United States Army Special Forces colonel best known for leading the Sơn Tây raid, an attempted rescue of U.S. prisoners of war during the Vietnam War from a North Vietnamese prison at Sơn Tây. He also led the successful 1979 rescue of two employees of Electronic Data Systems from prison in Iran.
Although serving 30 years as an officer spanning three wars, Simons was deemed not to fit the "career mold" for a general officer and did not rise above the rank of colonel. An Air Force officer who helped plan and execute the Sơn Tây raid wrote of Simons: "He was not out to make a name for himself; he was there to do his duty. He did not attend all the professional advancement schools and did not cultivate any sponsors for his career. He just answered every call because it was the right thing for an American soldier to do."
Early life.
Arthur David Simons was born in New York City, moving to Missouri in his youth. His family was Jewish. He attended the University of Missouri-Columbia and majored in journalism, entering the ROTC program there in 1937. After graduation, he married his girlfriend, Lucille, eventually having two boys, Bruce and Harry. He remained married to Lucille for 37 years until her death on March 16, 1978.
Army service.
Simons was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery Branch in 1941, and was initially assigned to the 98th Field Artillery Battalion, a part of one of the Army's pack mule units. In his first assignment as a platoon leader, he as the new lieutenant was so quiet and reserved (he later said he wanted to learn from the sergeants that seemed to know their business well) that one of his sergeants came to believe that Simons was a mute. The unit was dispatched to Australia, but immediately diverted to New Guinea in the early stages of World War II, and Simons thrived in the harsh jungle environment. He was soon promoted to the rank of Captain and served as a Battery Commander in the battalion from 1942 to 1943. The mules did not prove suitable in the jungle, and the unit was dissolved in 1943. Simons took his battery to the newly forming Ranger Battalion that would come out of the dissolution of his old unit. He soon became the commander of "B" (Baker) Company and later the battalion Executive Officer (XO) of the 6th Ranger Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mucci. Simons participated in several hazardous landings with the Rangers in the Pacific. He led a team of engineers and Navy personnel tasked to de-mine the Leyte channel before the invasion of the island began in earnest. On Luzon in the Philippines, he participated in the Raid at Cabanatuan that rescued approximately 500 POWs who were mostly survivors of the Bataan Death March. For his actions in the raid he was awarded the Silver Star. He quickly rose to the rank of Major and continued to prove his worth as a combat leader. At the conclusion of World War II, Major Simons left the active Army for five years.
Simons was recalled to active duty in 1951 to serve as an infantry instructor and Ranger trainer in the Amphibious and Jungle Training camp at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Other assignments included a year as a Public Information Officer (PIO, now "Public Affairs Officer" or PAO) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, a job that he despised: He held a low opinion of the media, one that would prove itself in later years and assignments. "The press hasn't done very well for the American soldier," he would later remark. Simons also completed tours with the Military Assistance Advisory Group, Turkey and XVIII Airborne Corps before joining the 7th Special Forces Group in 1958. In 1960 he served as Deputy Commander/Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army Special Warfare Center. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1961, he commanded the 107-man Operation White Star Mobile Training Team in Laos from 1961 to 1962 and was the first commander of the 8th Special Forces Group, Panama from 1962 to 1964. From Panama, he was assigned to the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG), which conducted numerous behind-the-line missions in Southeast Asia.
In 1970, Simons was hand-picked to command the army component of Operation Ivory Coast, a joint special operations effort to rescue American prisoners of war from the Sơn Tây prison in North Vietnam. While it did not rescue any prisoners (the camp was still used as a military installation but the prisoners had been removed a few months earlier), the otherwise highly-successful operation did force North Vietnam to consolidate all of the prisoners into a few central compounds in Hanoi, resulting in a boost in the prisoners' morale and improved treatment. They were also heartened to know that a rescue effort had been attempted. The North Vietnamese were shaken at the ease in which Americans could invade so close to their capital, and no American lives were lost in the operation (and only one minor injury, a sprained ankle). For his outstanding leadership, Simons was decorated by President Richard Nixon with the Distinguished Service Cross at the White House on November 25, 1970.
Simons' nickname "Bull" was taken from a physical training game called the "bull pit", where one soldier climbs down into a pit in the ground, and other soldiers engage in trying to pull the first soldier from the pit. Simon's large physical stature and great strength — even in his fifties, he did 250 push-ups every day — made him a formidable challenge to remove from the pit, and the name "Bull" stuck.
In retirement.
Colonel Simons retired from the Army on July 31, 1971, and moved with his wife to a small farm in Red Bay, Walton County, Florida, engaging in livestock farming and doing amateur gunsmithing on the side.
In late 1978, Simons was contacted by Texas businessman Ross Perot, who requested his direction and leadership to help free two employees of Electronic Data Systems who had been arrested shortly before the Iranian Revolution. Simons organized a rescue mission and ultimately freed the two men from the Iranian prison. All involved returned safely to the United States. The rescue operation was described in "On Wings of Eagles" (1983) written by British author Ken Follett.
Three months after the rescue mission, while on vacation in Vail, Colorado, Simons suffered a heart attack. He was transported to Dallas, Texas by a private jet chartered by Perot. He died one month later of persistent heart failure at the age of 60. He is interred in the Barrancas National Cemetery in Pensacola, Florida.
Legacy.
Ross Perot and others founded a scholarship initiative for the children of the casualties from the Iranian hostage rescue attempt, and named the fund in honor of Colonel Simons' memory.
In April 2010, the Arthur D. "Bull" Simons Center for Interagency Cooperation was opened as a result of a donation by Ross Perot to the Command and General Staff College Foundation, Inc. 
Colonel Simons' great contributions to the army and the Special Forces community are honored with a statue that stands in front of the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. 
The John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School presents an annual award called the "'Bull' Simons Award" to an outstanding special forces operator. 
Colonel Simons was also inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame.

Citation:
The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918 (amended by act of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Colonel (Infantry) Arthur D. Simons, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism while commanding the ground element of a joint United States task force on an operation deep in North Vietnam on 21 November 1970. With complete disregard for his own personal safety, Colonel Simons voluntarily participated as a member of a Joint Task Force with the humanitarian mission of rescuing United States military personnel held as prisoners of war at the Son Tay Prison Compound approximately twenty nautical miles from Hanoi, the capital of North Vietnam. In an outstanding display of leadership and personal courage, Colonel Simons led the ground force in the rescue effort. On the ground, the search and rescue element was immediately taken under automatic weapons fire by the enemy. While directing and supervising the operation, Colonel Simons continually exposed himself to enemy fire and, on one occasion, personally took under fire enemy personnel in close proximity to his position. The success of the operation was the direct result of Colonel Simons' calm and competent leadership in an extremely hazardous situation. His professional conduct instilled confidence in his men and resulted in an outstanding operation. Colonel Simons' extraordinary heroism was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Army and reflects great credit on him and the United States Army.

Love, Janis (musical)

Love, Janis is a musical stage show about the life and music of rock and roll singer Janis Joplin. It was conceived, adapted and directed by Randal Myler (, "It Ain't Nothin' But The Blues"). It debuted Off-Broadway in 2001 at the Village Theater (formerly the famed Village Gate) with musical direction by former Big Brother And The Holding Company band member Sam Andrew. The show had a long and healthy run, garnering over 700 performances.
Productions.
"Love, Janis" was initially produced by the Denver Center Theater Company in May 1994, written and directed by Randal Myler. Onstage Janis was played by Laura Theodore and private Janis was played by Catherine Curtin ("Stranger Things", "Orange Is The New Black").
"Love, Janis" was produced at the Zachary Scott Theatre Center, Austin, Texas, running August 1997–October 1997. Directed by Randal Myler, Andra Mitrovich played Janis as the soulful singer and Catherine Curtin portrayed the private woman. The musical also played at the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, New York in 2000, as well as the Cleveland Play House (in 1999) and the Royal George Theatre in Chicago (in 1999, Catherine Curtin receiving a Jeff Award nomination for Best Actress).
"Love, Janis" opened Off-Broadway at the Village Theatre, New York City, opening on April 10, 2001 and closed on January 5, 2003 after over 700 performances. Directed by Randal Myler, Catherine Curtin starred as Janis, with alternating performances by Cathy Richardson and Andra Mitrovich (later singers included Beth Hart, Laura Branigan, Orfeh, and Sass Jordan). Production design was by Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer; costumes were by Robert Blackman ("Star Trek").
Regional productions.
There were many regional productions that ran after the Off-Broadway production. The musical premiered on the West Coast at the San Diego Repertory Theatre in September 2001 (directed by Randal Myler). A production played at the Marines Memorial Theater in San Francisco, California in July 2006, directed by Myler and with musical direction by former Big Brother And The Holding Company band member Sam Andrew. The San Francisco production included lighting by Bill Ham, the man behind the psychedelic light shows at the Avalon Ballroom and other venues in San Francisco in the 1960s. A production ran at the Kansas City Repertory Theatre (Kansas City) in 2007, directed by Myler which featured Kacee Clanton and Mary Bridget Davies alternating as the singing Janis. The musical ran at the Alley Theatre in Houston, Texas starting in January 2008, directed by Myler and starring Katrina Chester.
Concept.
The musical was inspired by the best-selling book of the same name by sister Laura Joplin. Myler constructed the musical around the letters that Laura Joplin had given him. The musical begins in 1966, after Joplin has hitchhiked to San Francisco to join Big Brother and the Holding Company, and ends with her death in 1970. Her journey is told in her own words; the entire spoken text is quoted from Joplin's letters and interviews.
Performances include many of Joplin's most famous songs, "Piece of My Heart", "Get It While You Can", "Me and Bobby McGee", "Ball and Chain" and "Mercedes Benz". Music direction for the Off-Broadway production was provided by Sam Andrew, founding member of Big Brother and the Holding Company. A soundtrack album, using the original music and with letters read by Catherine Curtin, has also been released.

Ed McGivern

Edward McGivern (October 20, 1874 – December 12, 1957) was a famous exhibition shooter, shooting instructor and author of the book "Fast and Fancy Revolver Shooting". McGivern performed extensive research into the art of handgun shooting, particularly with the double-action revolver.
Book.
The book "Fast and Fancy Revolver Shooting", first published in 1938, is still printed by Skyhorse Publishing as a reference to handgun shooters. In it McGivern covers his career from early experimenting with single-action revolvers, his career in exhibition shooting, his police training, and his experiments in long-range revolver shooting.
Exhibition shooting.
Ed McGivern is renowned as one of the best handgunners that ever lived. His Guinness world record for "The greatest rapid-fire feat" (set on August 20, 1932 at the Lead Club Range, South Dakota) still stands. He emptied two revolvers in less than 2 seconds. He set another record on September 13, 1932, shooting five rounds from a double-action revolver at 15 feet in 2/5 of a second, and covering the group with his hand. His accomplishments include "firing two times from 15 feet five shots which could be covered by a silver half-dollar piece in 45/100 of a second". His shooting was so rapid, timing machines would malfunction in attempting to record his shooting speed.
McGivern was capable of many amazing shooting feats, most of them well documented in his book. To name just a few:
All of these executed with either hand using a factory Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 double-action revolver (purportedly his favorite handgun).
Competition shooter Jerry Miculek has attempted, and broken, some of McGivern's long-standing records, such as the record for 60 shots fired from 10 revolvers. Although Miculek holds a number of records, his attempt to beat McGivern's 5-shot record resulted in a time of .57 seconds.
A testament to McGivern's ability was that the 5-shot record was set in 1932, when McGivern was 57 years of age. Soon after that point, arthritis ended McGivern's competitive shooting career.
Long range shooting.
McGivern, along with his friend Elmer Keith, were instrumental in pushing the envelope in the early days of magnum revolvers. While Keith was primarily interested in hunting, McGivern was more interested in police use of the revolver. McGivern demonstrated that with proper sights and use, the .357 Magnum could be used on man-sized targets at ranges of up to .
McGivern experimented with different types of iron sights, including peep sights, and telescopic sights. His preferred type of iron sight for this use was a small-diameter rear aperture and a post with a gold bead for the front.
McGivern went on to instruct police agencies, including the FBI, in his shooting techniques.
Legacy.
In 2010, McGivern was inducted into the Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame.

Cradle (wrestling)

The cradle is a basic technique in amateur wrestling which is used to control and pin an opponent. The major purpose is to get into the controlling position while the name refers to the move's similarity to the way a person holds an infant in their arms. 
The wrestler performs the cradle by grabbing the neck of their opponent with one arm and wrapping the elbow of the other arm behind the knee of the opponent. The wrestler then locks both hands together to prevent their opponent from escaping. In addition to that, there are many ways to counter the cradle and many variations to the cradle maneuver. 
Types of cradle.
The "near-side cradle" is done by a wrestler grabbing the leg of the opponent that is closest to them and then wrapping and locking that with the opponent's neck. In addition to that, the "far side cradle" (or "outside cradle"). is executed by laying perpendicular to one's opponent while they are lying belly-down, then take the hand closest the opponent's legs and plant it in between the opponent's legs and cross-face them with the other arm. It further gets intense for opponent when wrestler scrunch arms together in the two directions which allows one's hands to grip together (this would be on the far side of the opponent, hence the name far side cradle). Then one digs their knee into their opponent's buttocks and lean back to get them on their back. Furthermore, when performing a far side cradle is to dig one's head into their opponent's head and squeeze the neck with one's arms, dig one's closest knee to the opponent, into their side, and then take one's free leg and hook their free leg and pull it down to the mat (but not so it is potentially dangerous). It adds more strength while doing it in the far side cradle adds pressure and pain to the opponent so they do not put up as much of a fight. 
The "standing cradle" is usually performed after taking an outside leg shot (outside sweep) and pulling the opponent's leg up, with one's arms in between the knee, and one standing to the outside of the opponent. Once one stands up with the leg, get one's arm that is nearest the foot of the leg one has and get it to the outside of the leg, so now both of one's arms are parallel and touch each other. It has a technique in which wrestler takes one's other arm and release the leg with that arm and put it around the opponent's neck. It further starts pulling one's arms together so that they can form a grip, and once they do that, trip them backward "slowly". It help the wrestler to put down on the mat which brings him into the position to apply more techniques of cradle and taking it further to win points. 
The "clap cradle is performed by pulling the opponent's leg up, placing one's free arm around the opponent's neck before clasping one's hands together to form a grip and trip the opponent quickly to the mat, where one can perform the same moves to the head, side, and leg. Similarly, the "leg cradle" requires a near side cradle position as preparation, and to pull one's arms in together for the grip to be set. Before one sets their grip, one must throw their legs in on the sides that the leg corresponds with the hand. 
Outcomes.
A wrestler executing the cradle can secure a pin. If the wrestler who cradles their opponent cannot get the pin, they also have the opportunity to gain two or three near fall (or back) points in collegiate wrestling. Conversely, with enough foresight and experience, a cradled wrestler can still exert their raw physical strength to escape from the hold. Application of the cradle leaves later opportunities open for the cradled wrestler to gain an escape or even a reversal over his worn-out opponent.

Les Girls

Les Girls (also known as Cole Porter's Les Girls) is a 1957 American CinemaScope musical comedy film directed by George Cukor and produced by Sol C. Siegel, with Saul Chaplin as associate producer. The screenplay is by John Patrick and the story is by Vera Caspary. The music and lyrics are by Cole Porter.
It stars Gene Kelly, Mitzi Gaynor, Kay Kendall, and Taina Elg, and the cast also includes Jacques Bergerac, Leslie Phillips, Henry Daniell, and Patrick Macnee.
Plot summary.
Barry, Joy, Sybil and Angele were formerly members of the cabaret dance troupe "Barry Nichols and Les Girls". Years after the group has dissolved, Sybil, now Lady Wren, publishes a tell-all memoir containing details of her days in the theatre, and makes a point of detailing Angele's alleged suicide attempt after Barry ended their affair. Angele is outraged by Sybil's claims and sues her for libel. The case goes to trial where the two women relate the history of the troupe as they recall it, however, they each remember matters very differently.
Sybil remembers Angele as an easy, deceitful woman who tried to keep her engagement to a man named Pierre from Barry to keep her affair going, but ultimately jeopardized both relationships when her lies were revealed. Angele remembers Sybil as a drunkard who was madly in love with Barry - and that Angele herself had no relationship with Barry at all. According to Angele, Sybil was promised to another man from England - Gerald - who upon finding out the nature of her relationship to Barry, started a physical altercation with him. This led Sybil to once more abuse alcohol and then attempt suicide, feeling as though she had ruined both relationships.
Finally Barry takes the stand to reveal that neither of the girls' stories were quite right. All along, Barry had actually been pursuing Joy romantically. Pierre and Gerald had asked Barry to fire Angele and Sybil so that they may end their careers and get married, but Barry insists firing them will only make things worse. He concocts a plan that involves faking a heart condition and suggests that it will result in him having to close the theatre. The three women, distraught at the sudden news, all agree to quit for his sake. However, he reveals the truth to Joy at his apartment who at first finds him despicable, but quickly learns to forgive him when she realizes his good intentions.
As they both return to the girls' apartment, they realize a gas leak has occurred and Angele, along with Sybil, had both collapsed in their drunken stupor following their farewell party to Barry, and were exposed to the toxic gas. They were both rescued but never reunited after that... until the trial. With the case now settled that there was no suicide attempt, but rather both women had misunderstood the gas leak as a suicide attempt on behalf of the other, they reunite outside the courtroom to make amends. As Barry leaves, it is revealed that he had indeed ended up marrying Joy, though she doubts his claim that he had not fooled around with Angele and Sybil at all.
Sequel.
Immediately after the film was released, tentative plans were announced for a sequel called "Les Boys". While the sequel did not come to pass, Les Girls did inspire "Harry's Girls", a sitcom starring Larry Blyden which ran on NBC for 15 episodes in the fall of 1963.
Box office.
According to MGM records the film made $2,415,000 in the US and Canada and $1,450,000 elsewhere, but because of its high production cost lost $1,635,000.
Choreography.
"Les Girls" was a major vehicle for choreographer Jack Cole, and one of the first films to feature the role of choreographer in the opening credits.

Duxford Aerodrome

Duxford Aerodrome is located south of Cambridge, within the civil parish of Duxford, Cambridgeshire, England and nearly west of the village. The airfield is owned by the Imperial War Museum (IWM) and is the site of the Imperial War Museum Duxford and the American Air Museum.
Duxford Aerodrome has a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Ordinary Licence (Number P678) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Cambridgeshire County Council). The aerodrome is not licensed for night use.
History.
Early Use.
The area around Duxford was first used for military purposes as part of the Army Manoeuvres of 1912. It was not until October 1917 that construction was started on a more formal airfield. The new aerodrome was built as part of a pair with a sister station at Fowlmere.
The hangars built in the period correspond to a Directorate of Fortifications and Works drawing number 332/17. The drawing was signed by Lieutenant-Colonel BHO Armstrong of the Royal Engineers.
The first units arriving at the new Training Depot Station in March 1918. These new arrivals included members of the American Expeditionary Forces.
Duxford airfield dates to 1918 when many of the buildings were constructed by German prisoner-of-war labour. The airfield housed 8 Squadron in 1919–1920 which was equipped with Bristol Fighters. The airfield was then used by No. 2 Flying Training School RAF until April 1923, when 19 Squadron was formed at Duxford with Sopwith Snipes.
Inter War Years.
Following the First World War the airfield was retained by the Royal Air Force as a training school. It was then reclassified as a fighter station from 1 April 1923.
By 1925 Duxford's three fighter squadrons had expanded to include the Gloster Grebes and Armstrong Whitworth Siskins. No.19 Squadron was re-equipped with Bristol Bulldogs in 1931, and in 1935, was the first squadron to fly the RAF's fastest new fighter, the Gloster Gauntlet, capable of 230 mph (375 km/h). 
The wooden-framed barrack buildings (with one exception) were replaced, beginning in 1928.
A further round of works took place in 1931, with the base headquarters, guardroom and domestic buildings being constructed. The first of the domestic buildings ready for use was the Sergeant's Mess.
Further rounds of building took place in 1935 (Scheme 'A') and in 1939 (Scheme 'M').
On 6 July 1935, Duxford hosted a Silver Jubilee Review before King George V who observed 20 squadrons from a dais on the aerodrome.
In 1936 Flight Lieutenant Frank Whittle, who was studying at Cambridge University, flew regularly from Duxford as a member of the Cambridge University Air Squadron. Whittle went on to develop the jet turbine as a means of powering an aircraft.
In 1938 No. 19 Squadron was the first RAF squadron to receive the new Supermarine Spitfire. The third production Spitfire (K9789) was presented to the squadron at Duxford on 4 August 1938 by Jeffrey Quill, Supermarine's chief test pilot.
Second World War.
The air defence of the United Kingdom by RAF Fighter Command was divided into areas, known as groups. RAF Duxford was the southern most station in the area covered by 12 Group under the command of Air Vice-Marshall Trafford Leigh-Mallory. The group was responsible for the defence of the Midlands, East Anglia and some of northern England.
By June 1940 Belgium, the Netherlands and France were under German control and the invasion of Britain was their next objective (Operation Sea Lion). Duxford was placed in a high state of readiness, and to create space for additional units at Duxford, 19 Squadron moved to nearby RAF Fowlmere. 
The dominance of the skies over Britain would be crucial to keeping German forces out of the country, this became known as The Battle of Britain. Hurricanes first arrived at Duxford in July with the formation of 310 Squadron, which consisted of Czechoslovakian pilots who had escaped from France. 
On 9 September the Duxford squadrons successfully intercepted and turned back a large force of German bombers before they reached their target. This proved Duxford's importance, (but see the article on the Big Wing), so two more squadrons were added, No. 302 (Polish) Squadron RAF with Hurricanes, and the Spitfires of No. 611 Auxiliary Squadron which had mobilised at Duxford a year before.
On average sixty Spitfires and Hurricanes were dispersed around Duxford and RAF Fowlmere every day. On 15 September 1940 they twice took to the air to repulse "Luftwaffe" aircraft intent on bombing London. RAF Fighter Command was victorious, the threat of invasion passed and Duxford's squadrons had played a critical role. This became known as 'Battle of Britain Day'.
In recognition of the efforts, achievements and sacrifices made by the squadrons and airmen during the Battle of Britain, the "gate guard" aircraft on display at the entrance gate to IWM Duxford is a Hawker Hurricane II, squadron code WX-E of No.302 (Polish) Squadron, Serial No. P2954, flown by Flight Lieutenant Tadeusz Paweł Chłopik, RAF (Polish Air Force).
The 'Big Wing'.
Douglas Bader, who commanded 242 Squadron (originally at RAF Coltishall), came up with a strategy known as the 'Big Wing'. This involved the deployment of 3 (later 5) squadrons of Spitfires and Hurricanes to engage the enemy.
There was disagreement between commanders as to the merits of the strategy. This culminated in the removal of Sir Hugh Dowding as Commander in Chief at Fighter Command, as well as the replacement of Air Vice-Marshall Keith Park at 11 Group by Leigh-Mallory.
Air Fighting Development Unit.
Duxford became the home of several specialist units, including the Air Fighting Development Unit (AFDU), which moved to the station in December 1940.
The work of the AFDU including the testing and evaluation of the Hawker Typhoon, the Mosquito and the Mustang.
In 1942 the first Typhoon Wing was formed. Its first operation took place on 20 June 1942.
The AFDU's equipment included captured German aircraft, which were restored to flying condition for evaluation.
Other RAF Fighter Command units which operated from Duxford were : 19, 56, 66, 133, 181, 195, 222, 242, 264, 266, 310, 312, 601, 609, 611 Squadrons and the AFDU.

Duxford airfield was assigned to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) on 1 April 1943 and then became known by the USAAF as "Station 357 (DX)". It was allocated to the Eighth Air Force's VIII Fighter Command.
USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Duxford were: 
Duxford was the initial home of the 5th Air Defense Wing which arrived from Norfolk Municipal Airport, Virginia on 3 July 1943. The unit was re designated the 66th Fighter Wing and was transferred to Sawston Hall near Cambridge on 20 August 1943.
Combat flying units assigned were:
The 350th Fighter Group was activated at Duxford on 1 October 1942 by special authority granted to the Eighth Air Force with a nucleus of Bell P-39 Airacobra pilots with the intention of providing a ground attack fighter organisation for the Twelfth Air Force in the forthcoming Operation Torch, (the invasion of North Africa). Initially, the group received export versions of the Airacobra, known as the P-400, and a few Spitfires.
The air echelon moved to Oujda, French Morocco during January–February 1943. After this the last RAF units moved out and on 15 June 1943 Duxford was officially handed over to the Eighth Air Force.
The 78th Fighter Group arrived at Duxford from RAF Goxhill in April 1943. Upon transfer from Goxhill, the group lost its Lockheed P-38 Lightnings when these aircraft were withdrawn for use as replacements for units fighting in North Africa. In addition most of the 78th FG's pilots were also transferred to the Twelfth Air Force as replacements. Thus the group was re-equipped with Republic P-47C Thunderbolts and remained at Duxford. Aircraft of the group were identified by a black/white chequerboard pattern.
The group consisted of the following squadrons:
The 78th FG was first equipped with P-47s and converted to P-51 Mustangs in December 1944. The group flew many missions to escort Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers that attacked industrial complexes, submarine yards and docks, V-weapon sites and other targets in Continental Europe. The unit also engaged in counter-air activities and on numerous occasions strafed and dive-bombed airfields, trains, vehicles, barges, tugs, canal locks, barracks and troops.
In addition to other operations, the 78th participated in the intensive campaign against "Luftwaffe" aircraft industry during Big Week, 20–25 February 1944 and helped to prepare the way for the invasion of France. The group supported the Normandy landings in June 1944 and contributed to the breakthrough at Saint-Lô in July. The unit participated in the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945 and supported Operation Varsity, the airborne assault across the Rhine, in March.
The 78th Fighter Group received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for activities connected with Operation Market Garden, the airborne attack on the Netherlands, in September 1944 when the group covered troop carrier and bombardment operations and carried out strafing and dive-bombing missions. The group received a second DUC for destroying numerous aircraft on five airfields near Prague and Pilsen in Czechoslovakia on 16 April 1945.
The 78th Fighter Group returned to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey in October 1945 and was inactivated on 18 October.
Postwar use.
On 1 December 1945, a few weeks after the departure of the 78th Fighter Group, Duxford was returned to the RAF. For the next sixteen years, it remained an RAF Fighter Command station, although it was closed for two years from October 1949 to have a single concrete runway laid. This, together with a new perimeter track and apron, enabled better handling of jet aircraft with which Fighter Command was re-equipping.
Duxford reopened in August 1951. In 1957, 64 Squadron operated Gloster Javelins and 65 Squadron flew Hawker Hunters. These were the last two operational squadrons to fly from the airfield. Two years later, Duxford was chosen to provide the aircraft for the 1953 Coronation Flypast.
Duxford was too far south and too far inland to be strategically important and the costly improvements required for modern supersonic fighters could not be justified. In July 1961 the last operational RAF flight was made from Duxford by a Gloster Javelin FAW.7.
On 1 August 1961, a Gloster Meteor NF.14 made the last take off from the runway before Duxford closed as an RAF airfield and was abandoned.
Filming and other civilian uses.
In 1968 Duxford was used as one of the locations for the shooting of the film Battle of Britain. On 21 June and 22 June, one of the original World War I hangars was blown up in stages for the filming (without the concurrence of the Ministry of Defence) and the airfield was spectacularly filmed from the air in a realistic bombing sequence. Ironically this was the nearest Duxford came to being destroyed as no significant wartime German raids were carried out on the aerodrome. The French château, seen at the beginning of the film, was constructed on the south-west corner of the airfield.
Around 1968 the Cambridge University Gliding Club moved some of its flying to Duxford. Subsequently, all club flying was moved to the site.
In 1969 The Ministry of Defence declared its intention to dispose of Duxford. Plans were even made for a sports centre or a prison but were never finalised.
In 1976 Sir Douglas Bader spoke before a public inquiry against proposals to build the M11 motorway across the eastern boundary.
Duxford was used as one of the locations for filming in 1989 for the Hollywood movie Memphis Belle, with flying sequences flown from the airfield site.
Formula One teams used Duxford to conduct straight-line speed tests with an aim to develop aerodynamics. During a test in 2012, Marussia F1 driver María de Villota crashed heavily into the lift gate of the team transporter, and sustained serious injuries to her right eye and brain. De Villota would later succumb to her injuries in 2013.
IWM, American Air Museum and other employments.
Today, RAF Duxford is owned by the Imperial War Museum (IWM) and is the site of the 
Imperial War Museum Duxford, and the American Air Museum. It also houses The Fighter Collection and the Historic Aircraft Collection, two private operators of airworthy vintage military aircraft.
The Imperial War Museum had been looking for a suitable site for the storage, restoration and eventual display of exhibits too large for its headquarters in London and obtained permission to use the airfield for this purpose. Cambridgeshire County Council joined with the IWM and the Duxford Aviation Society and in 1977 bought the runway to give the abandoned airfield a new lease of life. Also in 1977 the main runway was shortened from by about due to the construction of the M11 motorway, which passes along the eastern side of the airfield. The final aircraft to land at Duxford before the runway was shortened was Concorde test aircraft G-AXDN, now on display in the Airspace hangar.
In October 2008, an agreement was reached between Cambridgeshire County Council and the IWM, under which the runways and of surrounding grassland would be sold to the museum for approximately £1.6 million.
The site is home to Historic Flying Limited (Also known as The Aircraft Restoration Company). 
The IWM and Cambridge University Gliding Club coexisted on the site for many years, but in 1991 increasing restrictions led the club to move to Gransden Lodge.
The site is sometimes used by Formula One teams such as Renault and Lotus for testing. On Tuesday, 3 July 2012 María de Villota suffered an ultimately fatal accident while testing at the airfield for Marussia F1. The following day, team principal John Booth issued a statement which confirmed that the accident resulted in the loss of de Villota's right eye. De Villota died in October 2013, as a result of long-term neurological damage sustained in the accident.

Dysnomia (deity)

In Greek mythology, Dysnomia () is the personification of lawlessness. According to Hesiod's "Theogony", Dysnomia was the offspring of Eris (Strife), with no father mentioned. Like all of the children of Eris given by Hesiod, Dysnomia is a personified abstraction, allegorizing the meaning of their name, and representing one of the many harmful things which might be thought to result from discord and strife, with no other identity.
Hesiod associates Dysnomia with Ate [Recklessness]. He names both as offspring of Eris, on the same line (230) of his "Theogony", and says that the two are "much like one another".
Solon.
The Athenian statesman Solon contrasted Dysnomia with Eunomia, the personification of the ideal government:
Solon makes Dysnomia the cause of the "countless" evils besetting Athens: greed, the injustice of the city's leaders, the slavery of the poor, and civil war.
Legacy.
In 2005, Dysnomia was chosen as the name for the moon of the dwarf planet Eris.

<doc id="6991593" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6991593" title="Hidimba Devi Temple">
Hidimba Devi Temple

Hidimba Devi Temple, locally known as Dhungari Temple, also known variously as the Hadimba Temple, is a Hindu Temple, located in Manāli, a hill station in the State of Himāchal Pradesh in north India. It is an ancient cave temple dedicated to Hidimbi Devi, wife of Bhima, a figure in the Indian epic Mahābhārata. The temple is surrounded by a cedar forest called Dhungiri Van Vihar at the foot of the Himālayas. The sanctuary is built over a huge rock jutting out of the ground which was worshiped as an image of the deity. The structure was built in 1553 by Maharaja Bahadur Singh.
The Hidimba Devi temple is 24 meters tall.
History.
The Hidimba Devi temple was built in 1553 CE by Maharaja Bahadur Singh. The temple is built around a cave where Devi Hidimba performed meditation. Hidimbi was supposed to have lived there with her brother Hidimb, and not much is known about their parents. Born into a Rakshasa family, Hidimba vowed to marry one who would defeat her brother Hidimb, who was supposed to be very brave and fearless. During the Pandava's exile, when they visited Manali, Bhima, one of the five Pandavas defeated Hidimb. Thereafter, Hidimba married Bhima and gave birth to their son Ghatotkacha.
Worship of Goddess Hidimba.
The veneration of Hidimba Devi holds significant cultural prominence in Manali, where she is revered as a deity. While Navaratri conventionally sees the worship of Goddess Durga, the spiritual spotlight in Manali shifts to Goddess Hidimba. The temple draws considerable crowds, particularly during Navaratri, attesting to the fervent devotion of the worshippers. Annually, the locals enthusiastically observe the Hidimba Devi Fair, a cherished tradition coinciding with the arrival of spring.
Design.
The Hidimba Devi Temple has intricately carved wooden doors and a 24-meter-tall wooden "shikhar" or tower above the sanctuary. The tower consists of three square roofs covered with timber tiles and a fourth brass cone-shaped roof at the top. The earth goddess Durga forms the theme of the main door carvings. Also depicted are animals, foliate designs, dancers, scenes from Lord Krishna’s life and Navagrahas. The temple base is made out of whitewashed, mud-covered stonework. An enormous rock occupies the inside of the temple, only a 7.5 cm (3 inch) tall brass image representing goddess Hidimba Devi. A rope hangs down in front of the rock, and according to a legend, in bygone days religious zealots would tie the hands of "sinners" by the rope and then swing them against the rock.
About seventy metres away from the temple, there is a shrine dedicated to Goddess Hidimba's son, Ghatotkacha, who was born after she married Bhima. The most surprising feature of the temple or what believers could call the most reassuring feature of the temple is the fact that inside the temple the imprint of the feet of the Goddess carved on a block of stone is worshipped.
A Mahabharat narration.
The Indian epic Mahabharata narrates that the Pāndavas stayed in Himachal during their exile. In Manali, the strongest person there, named Hidimb and brother of Hidimba, attacked them, and in fight Bhima, strongest amongst the Pandavas, killed him. Bhima and Hidimb's sister, Hidimbi, then got married and had a son, Ghatotkacha, (who later proved to be a great warrior in the war against Kauravas). When Bhima and his brothers returned from exile, Hidimbi did not accompany him, but stayed back and did tapasyā (a combination of meditation, prayer, and penance) so as to eventually attain the status of a goddess.

Manatawny Creek

Manatawny Creek is an tributary of the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania in the United States.
Etymology.
The name of the creek comes from the Lenape (or Delaware Indian) term "Man'en'tau'wata'wik". Some early sources state that the term translates to "where we drank liquor", but later sources disagree with that interpretation, putting the meaning closer to "here we drink" or "drink-at-uninhabited-place," without reference to liquor.
Course.
The tributary Ironstone Creek joins the Manatawny at Pine Forge. Manatawny Creek is formed by the confluence of Bieber Creek and Pine Creek just below Lobachsville.
Manatawny Creek joins the Schuylkill River at Pottstown in Montgomery County.
History.
Manatawny Creek Dam was located about 500 meters upstream of where Manatawny Creek joins with the Schuylkill river. A low-head dam, it was built around 1850, but by 1999 had been legally declared as orphaned with no legal owner. It was removed in 2002, which allowed Manatawny Creek and its tributaries to be removed from the state’s 303(d) list.

Ovarense Basquetebol

Ovarense Basquetebol is a professional basketball team that plays in Ovar, Portugal. The team plays in the LPB. The Ovarense created its section of basketball in 1970, with the initiative of a member entrepreneur, João Gonçalves, but in this period of time managed to assert itself as one of the standards and the inevitable reference method in Portugal.
History.
Between 1976–77 and 1978–79, Ovarense ascended from third to first, on the national level, indicating that the team's basketball vocation was strong. The club never fell from its division, and the arrival of two Americans at the end of the 80s gave the team the quality required to raise its level.

John William Gillis (October 31, 1936 – August 15, 2009), generally known as Bill Gillis, was a Canadian politician who served in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1970 to 1998. He represented the electoral district of Antigonish for the Liberals.
Born in Boston, Massachusetts, his family moved to Antigonish when he was six weeks old. Gillis was a graduate of St. Francis Xavier University, and held a doctorate in geology from Pennsylvania State University. Gillis was employed as a geologist with the Canadian Department of Energy, Mines and Resources from 1962 to 1967. He taught geology at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia from 1967 to 1970. Gillis died on August 15, 2009, as a result of brain cancer.
Political career.
Gillis first attempted to enter provincial politics in the 1967 election, but lost to Progressive Conservative William F. MacKinnon by 26 votes. He ran again in the 1970 election and defeated Progressive Conservative William Shaw by 408 votes to win the Antigonish riding. On October 28, 1970, he was appointed by Premier Gerald Regan to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Agriculture and Marketing, and Minister of Municipal Affairs. He was named Minister of Welfare in September 1972, and was shuffled to Minister of Education in August 1973. Gillis was re-elected in the 1974 election, and remained as Minister of Education until February 1976 when he became Minister of Mines.

In the 1993 election, the Liberals led by John Savage won a majority government, and Gillis was re-elected in his riding by over 4,000 votes. On June 11, 1993, Savage appointed Gillis to cabinet as Deputy Premier and Minister of Justice, becoming the first non-lawyer in the province's history to hold the justice job. Gillis remained as Minister of Justice until June 26, 1996, when he became Minister of Finance, while being retained as Deputy Premier, the two jobs he continued to hold after Russell MacLellan took over as premier in July 1997. Gillis did not reoffer in the 1998 election.

<doc id="6991701" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6991701" title="Haiku Society of America">
Haiku Society of America

The Haiku Society of America is a non-profit organization composed of haiku poets, editors, critics, publishers and enthusiasts that promotes the composition and appreciation of haiku in English. Founded in 1968, it is the largest society dedicated to haiku and related forms of poetry outside Japan, and holds meetings, lectures, workshops, readings, and contests, throughout the United States. The society's journal, "Frogpond", first published in 1978, appears three times a year. As of 2022, the HSA has over 1,000 members.
Activities.
The HSA web site includes information on how to get involved with its regional chapters, as well as information on contests, society meetings, and publications including "Frogpond". The society also publishes a monthly email newsletter with news on regional, national, and international haiku events. The Haiku Society of America is well known for its annual contests for haiku, senryū, haibun, renku, and renga, as well as the Merit Book Awards for the best haiku books published each year.
History.
The Haiku Society of America was founded in 1968 by Harold G. Henderson and Leroy Kanterman in New York City, and was the first formal organization dedicated to haiku outside of Japan. Twenty-one charter members attended its first meeting. Bringing together poets study, discuss, and write haiku, the organization's stated goals were to:
Early members included Nicholas A. Virgilio, Elizabeth Searle Lamb, L.A. Davidson (Laura Agnes), Virginia Brady Young, Alan Pizzarelli, and Anita Virgil. American poet Cor van den Heuvel first attended a meeting in 1971. Annual readings and lectures featured translators such as Cid Corman, Donald Keene, and Hiroaki Sato, as well as speakers from Japan including scholar Kenkichi Yamamoto, and haiku poet Sumio Mori. For a period, the official magazine of the society was called "Haiku West", and was edited by Leroy Kanterman.
In the early 1970s, the Haiku Society of America formed a committee to agree on a definition of haiku, which they submitted to the publishers of several English dictionaries, and became the first widely accepted definition, which has continued to be revised over the years. In 1975, HSA held sessions focusing on renga, and published the 36-verse kasen format in its newsletter. By 1989, the society had a few hundred members located throughout North America, Europe, and Japan, and was publishing a quarterly magazine, with no paid staff.
In 1994, the society produced "A Haiku Path", an important work documenting the history of Western haiku. "Frogpond" was one of the two most prominent haiku journals, along with "Modern Haiku", and many poets were published in both.
In 1996 and 1997, the Haiku Society of America and the Haiku International Association held reciprocal conferences in Chicago and Tokyo. By 1997, HSA membership had grown to 700, having more than doubled in the space of 12 years.
Since 1993, the society has published an annual membership anthology.
Past presidents.
From 1979 to 1981, Hiroaki Sato, a translator of Japanese poetry into English, served as president of the Haiku Society of America. Other past presidents have included poet, historian, and editor Elizabeth Searle Lamb; poet Cor van den Heuvel; poet Lee Gurga, a translator of contemporary Japanese poets and editor of "Modern Haiku"; and John Stevenson, who was also an editor of "Frogpond".

U.D. Oliveirense (basketball)

União Desportiva Oliveirense, commonly known as Oliveirense Basquetebol or simply Oliveirense, is a basketball team based in Oliveira de Azemeis, Portugal. It plays in Portuguese LPB. The team has won two Portuguese Championships, one Portuguese Cup, two Portuguese Supercups and five League Cups. The team is a part of the parent football club U.D. Oliveirense.
The last time the club competed in Europe was in the 2003–04 season, when it played in the FIBA Europe League.
History.
Since its beginning, Oliveirense Basquetebol was a powerhouse in the Portuguese basketball field. In its year of creation, due to the disbanding of the ARCA (Associação Recreativa e Cultural de Azeméis), Oliveirense won the 3rd Division Title, rising to a more competitive 2nd Division.
However, the 2nd Division crumbled to the power of the Oliveirense players, who claimed their second National Title in two years. The rugged battle between the Oliveirense Basquetebol and the main powerhouses of Portuguese basketball was now underway, as the team faced big names, such as S.L. Benfica and FC Porto.
Once again, surprises were installed. With a brand new team and a new coach, Oliveirense did not do so well in its first season in the Portuguese LCB, however they were able to maintain their position and would later become, probably, the most powerful squad in Portuguese basketball history.
Years later, with the signing of Henrique Vieira as a coach, the 3-point expert Brian Crabtree as player, Oliveirense was the most dominant team in Portuguese basketball. During their Golden Years, Oliveirense won many of their palmares. They are, probably, the only team to have won all the National Titles except the Portuguese Championship. Their heated rivalry with Portugal Telecom, who made a three-peat always beating Oliveirense, had names such as Luís Magalhães and the center Jean-Jacques, which there were claims that referees where too scared to call a foul on Jean-Jacques, due to him being a physical specimen.
Finally, Oliveirense was able to defeat Portugal Telecom for the Portuguese Basketball Super Cup. Oliveirense represented the Portugueses Basketball National Cup, which they won the season before and Portugal Telecom, of course, represented the LCB Champion.
With three years in the Championship Finals, they were defeated all three times by the squad of Portugal Telecom. At the end of the last season championship win, Portugal Telecom disbanded through the will of the main shareholder, Portugal Telecom Comunicações.
With a, now, clear path to the championship, Oliveirense would once again fail to grab the Portuguese Championship, being eliminated in the second round of the playoffs. This was taken by fans as an enormous disappointment as the Oliveirense squad had the biggest names in the Portuguese LCB, such as veteran Carlos Seixas, former NBA player Trevor Huffman, former Portugal Telecom player Doug Muse and rising stars Carlos Abreu and Gregory Stempin.
Oliveirense would win a heated game against Ovarense Aerosoles for their last title as a professional team. They won the League Cup 83-77 against Ovarense Aerosoles and at the end of the amazing season, disaster struck the Basketball section.
Due to the financial distress of União Desportiva Oliveirense, Eduardo Costa, president of the club, disbanded the basketball section, the main profit winner of the franchise. Due to public disagreement and pressure by the most important basketball fans in Oliveirense, the youth teams were maintained.
Not being heard of one season, Oliveirense Basquetebol returned to the CNB2, the lowest division of Portuguese basketball. With former players form the youth teams, Oliveirense reached the 9th position in their first season and the 7th in their second season. They finally won the CNB2 title and promotion to the CNB1 in 2010. The feat was repeated the following year and in 2013 they finally won the Proliga and returned to the first division.
On 15 June 2018, Oliveirense conquered their first league title ever after defeating Porto by 3–0 in the finals, thus completing a perfect performance in the playoffs with nine wins in nine matches.
On 17 June 2019, Oliveirense won their second league title after defeating Benfica by 3-1 in the finals.

Moderate Party (Scotland)

The Moderate Party as a church term normally refers to an important group of clerics in the Church of Scotland in the 18th century. It is often contrasted with the Evangelicals, but that is very much a simplification. Most members of both parties considered themselves orthodox Christians and the leaders Principal Robertson for the Moderates and his Edinburgh University colleague, John Erskine for the Evangelicals, had a very warm and mutually respectful relationship.
The right of the landowning gentry to nominate ministers to parishes and its consequent influence on church matters underlay the various Secessions (of 1733 and 1752, in particular) from the Church of Scotland, which took place in the 18th century. However, the theological differences between Moderates and Evangelicals were significant indeed. For example, James Meek was a typical Moderate who had been nominated by the Duke of Hamilton and opposed by his Cambuslang parishioners on aspects of his preaching.
On the other hand, the significant achievements and stature of many Moderate clerics – such as Principal William Robertson of Edinburgh University and onetime Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland; his successor as principal and moderator, George Baird, who set up the Church's education system; Thomas Reid, philosopher; George Campbell, theologian; Adam Ferguson, philosopher and historian; John Home, dramatic poet; and Hugh Blair, literary scholar, makes it difficult to dismiss them as insincere .
As one later evangelical minister (WH Porter in "References" below) said, the Moderates "gave us our Paraphrases; Campbell, who replied to Hume, M'Knight the communicator, Hill the theologian, and Blair the preacher, were Moderates. Though in 1796, the Moderates were mainly, not entirely, responsible for the defeat of Foreign Missions proposals, yet in 1829, the Mission to India was founded by Dr Inglis, a Moderate. Principles Blair and M'Farlane were both moderates, yet to the one the Church of Scotland owes her Education Scheme, to the other her Colonial scheme".

Administrative divisions of Arkhangelsk Oblast

Within the framework of administrative divisions, Arkhangelsk Oblast is divided into six cities and towns of oblast significance, twenty-one districts, and two island territories (Franz Joseph Land and Victoria Island). Besides, Mirny is a town under the federal government management.
In terms of the area, the biggest administrative districts are Novaya Zemlya () and Mezensky District (). The smallest one is Solovetsky District.
In terms of the population, the biggest administrative district is Velsky District (61,819 in 2002), the smallest ones are Solovetsky District (968), Novaya Zemlya (2716), and Leshukonsky District (10,708).
Differences with municipal divisions.
Most of the administrative districts of Arkhangelsk Oblast are municipally incorporated as municipal districts, and most of the cities and towns of oblast significance are municipally incorporated as urban okrugs. There are, however, several exceptions,
History.
, 1708 Tsar Peter the Great issued an edict which established seven governorates. The description of the borders of the governorates was not given; instead, their area was defined as a set of towns and the lands adjacent to those towns. In the present area of Arkhangelsk oblast, two of the governorates—Archangelgorod Governorate and Ingermanland Governorate—were located. The governorates were subdivided into uyezds, and uyezds into volosts.
The centers of the following uyezds of Archangelgorod Governorate were located in the present-day area of Arkhangelsk Oblast,
Pustozyorsky Uyezd (with the center in Pustozerskoy) was located in what is now Nenets Autonomous Okrug.
On , 1719, the governorate was divided into provinces: Archangelgorod, Vologda, Galich, and Ustyug. Simultaneously, Yarensky Uyezd with the administrative center of Yarensk was moved from Siberia Governorate to Archangelgorod Governorate. The uyezds were transformed into districts, however, in 1727 the districts were transformed back into uyezds. On , 1780, Archangelgorod Governorate was transformed into Vologda Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was split into Arkhangelsk and Vologda Governorates, the latter one including the areas currently in the south-east of the Oblast. In 1918, these areas were split off from the Vologda Governorate and moved to the newly established Northern Dvina Governorate. The administrative center of the governorate was Veliky Ustyug.
The southwestern part of Arkhangelsk Oblast in 1708 became Kargopolsky Uyezd of Ingermanland Governorate (from 1710, Saint Petersburg Governorate), with the seat in the town of Kargopol. In 1727, it moved to the newly established Novgorod Governorate. After a number of administrative reforms, in 1801 it ended up as one of the four uyezds of the newly established Olonets Governorate.
In 1924, the uyezds of Northern Dvina Governorate were abolished in favor of the new divisions, the districts (raions). Arkhangelsk and Olonets Governorates retained the uyezd division till 1929. On July 15, 1929 the uyezds in these two governorates were abolished, and all areas which currently belong to Arkhangelsk Oblast, together with other areas, merged into the Northern Krai. The krai consisted of the Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast, a number of islands in the Arctic Ocean, as well as five administrative districts ("okrugs"),
All these okrugs (except for the Nenets Okrug) were divided into districts. In 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts became directly subordinate to the Northern Krai. In 1936, according to the new Soviet Constitution, the Northern Krai was transformed into Northern Oblast. In 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast. In 1941, three districts of Arkhangelsk Oblast—Oparinsky, Lalsky, and Podosinovsky—were transferred to Kirov Oblast. During the attempted administrative reform in 1963, districts were subdivided into urban and rural districts. The reform was abandoned in 1965, and the division into districts was restored. On March 23, 1987, Solovetsky District was established, and in 2001, Novaya Zemlya obtained the district status.
Abolished districts.
After 1929 (with the exception of the aborted reform of 1963–1965) borders between the districts sometimes were modified, and as a result some of the districts in the area currently belonging to Arkhangelsk Oblast were abolished,

E!E

E!E is a Czech punk rock band from Příbram, founded in 1987. The band consists of Bořivoj Řehoř (vocals), Petr Bakalerov (lead guitar and vocals), Petr Stawarz (guitar), Petr Mottl (bass), and Roman Vojtíšek (drums).
History.
E!E was formed at the end of 1987 in Příbram, Czechoslovakia. It was originally made up of Robert Kyselo on drums, Vilda Řapek on bass guitar and vocals, Petr "Bakča" Bakalerov on guitar and vocals, and Miroslav Bergerstein on accordion and vocals.
The band held their first performance in 1988. The same year, Řapek and Bergerstein left and Bořivoj "Bořek" Řehoř joined on bass. He passed bass duties to Petr "Motlík" Mottl shortly after and took over on vocals full-time.
E!E recorded their first cassette, titled "Obyčejní poserové", in 1988. After this release, Bakalerov, the only remaining founding member, moved to Písek, and Ladislav Havlík was hired to take over guitar duties. The group continued to perform as E!E with him, while playing as Hilfe Schule with Bakalerov, though the two entities eventually merged, retaining both guitarists and their original name. Havlík was replaced by Petr Stawarz in 1991. The group's lineup stabilized in 1992 after the arrival of drummer Roman Vojtíšek.
E!E went on to release a number of albums, starting with "0001" in 1992 and followed by "Poslouchej" (1993), "Mrtvák" (1995), and "Deska" (1996). On 7 July 1996, they opened for the Sex Pistols at Prague's Sportovní hala.
Bořivoj Řehoř subsequently left the band, leaving Bakalerov as the sole vocalist. In 1998, E!E released the album "Děláme co můžem". A year later, the band, together with Řehoř, re-recorded 26 older tracks and released them as a compilation, under the name "Dvacet pe!ecek + bonus", after which Řehoř rejoined on vocals. Two albums followed: "Lepší už to nebude" in 2006 and "2012" in its eponymous year.
On 15 December 2013, E!E founding member Petr Bakalerov died. Several well-known Czech punk bands took part in a commemorative concert, including Visací zámek and Tři sestry. Guitarist Robin Davídek plays with the band as a guest to this day.
In 2017, the group celebrated thirty years of existence with the release of their second compilation, titled "E!E 30 let panknrolu a chlastu".

Stratonice (opera)

Stratonice is a one-act "opéra comique" by Étienne Méhul to a libretto by François-Benoît Hoffman, first performed at the Théâtre Favart in Paris, on 3 May 1792. The plot is taken from "De Dea Syria" ("On the Syrian Goddess", attributed to Lucian) concerning an incident from the history of the Seleucid dynasty which ruled much of the Middle East during the Hellenistic era of the ancient world.
Performance history.
"Stratonice" was a popular opera, receiving over 200 performances during Méhul's lifetime. On 6 June 1792, a parody titled "Nice", by Jean-Baptiste Desprez and Alexandre de Ségur, appeared at the Théâtre du Vaudeville. In 1821, Méhul's nephew, Joseph Daussoigne-Méhul, wrote new recitatives for the opera's revival in Paris at the Académie Royale de Musique.
Synopsis.
Antiochus, the son of King Seleucus, is pining away yet he would rather die than name the cause of his disease to his father. The doctor, Erasistratus, suspects love is behind Antiochus's suffering. He notices that the prince's pulse rate increases when he sees Stratonice, a young woman intended as his father's bride, and further tests confirm his diagnosis. The doctor subtly reveals the truth to the king who is content to relinquish Stratonice to Antiochus to save his son's life and happiness.
The work.
Libretto.
Hoffman designated "Stratonice" as a "comédie héroïque", meaning a drama with a happy ending (contemporary French critics generally avoided the term "tragicomedy" as this suggested a work mixing tragic and comic elements). The choice of a Classical subject was unusual for an "opéra comique" of the time and set the fashion for similar works, including Méhul's own "Épicure" and "Bion". The story of Stratonice had appeared several times on the French stage in the 17th and 18th centuries. Hoffman was particularly influenced by Thomas Corneille's play "Antiochus" (1666). French opera composers had also treated the subject: it forms the plot of the second "entrée" in Rameau's "Les fêtes de Polymnie" (1745).
Music.
Méhul's friend and rival composer Cherubini deeply admired "Stratonice": "Of all the works by Méhul, this is the best from beginning to end..."Stratonice" lacks nothing; it is a work of genius, Méhul's masterpiece." Hoffman's choice of Classical subject was unusual for the Opéra-Comique and Méhul's music was similarly innovative, more influenced by the serious tradition of "tragédie lyrique" than the lighter "opéra comiques" of Grétry which had been fashionable up to that point. Méhul studied Gluck and Salieri for their approach to musical drama, as well as Haydn's orchestration and the melodies of Sacchini and Piccinni, Italian composers who had written tragic operas for the French stage in the 1770s and 1780s. But he blended these influences with his own individual style to produce an original work. Contemporary critics praised the more melodic style of "Stratonice" compared to Méhul's earlier operas, "Euphrosine" and "Cora". The most striking part of the work is the ensemble "Parlez, parlez, achevez de m'apprendre" (Numbers 5, 6 and 7), which builds from a duet to a trio and finally to a quartet of the four main characters. According to the critic Elizabeth Bartlet, this quartet made a great impression on the artist Ingres, a music lover who owned a copy of the score, and later painted a work entitled "Antiochus and Stratonice", depicting this very moment.

Network (video game)

Network is a real-time, two player business simulation game developed by David Mullich for the Apple II and published by Edu-Ware in 1980.
Gameplay.
Two players play competitively against the computer, each taking the role of the programming chief for a major television network. Each side bids on new television shows to add to the season's line-up, schedules them, monitors the weekly ratings, and then drops shows with poor ratings or reschedules them to recover from mistakes at the end of the thirteen-week season. The side with the highest ratings is the winner.
Reception.
Bruce Webster reviewed "Network" in "The Space Gamer" No. 31. Webster commented that "Unfortunately, I just could not get interested in the game. It moves slowly and requires (for intelligent play) that the players keep track of a lot of information that is not always easily accessible. One friend I played against quit out of boredom at one point, and I found myself yawning. There is a lack of tension, which means that personal interest must be the overriding factor in playing the game - and I'm just not that interested in network planning. If you are, then this is the game for you; otherwise, I'm afraid you'll just be disappointed."

Saran (director)

K. V. Saravanan, better known as Saran, is an Indian film director and screenwriter who active mainly in Tamil cinema. He was once an assistant to K. Balachander. He owns production house called "Gemini Productions."
Early life and career.
Saran's father T. Kulandaivelayudam worked with the directorate of examinations and many of his relatives are teachers. He finished diploma in visual communications from the College of Arts And Crafts and became an instructor in textile designing. Saran worked as instructor for a year and, during this time, he did some work with a lady called Mohana who was art director for K. Balachander. KB was the director whom Saran admired above all others. Saran hoped this relationship would be the key to get to him. He joined as an assistant director to KB when he was making "Pudhu Pudhu Arthangal" (1989).
By then, Saran was also a cartoonist for Ananda Vikatan. He would do this work at two in the morning, sleep for a bit and get back to work with KB by 7 am. Finally, Sarann gave up working as a cartoonist because assisting KB was too demanding. And then, Sarann's first film happened. He describes that he "was wondering what would happen if a girl, who is engaged to a particular person, falls in love with someone else" and this formed the basis of his plot for his first film "Kadhal Mannan" (1998). The film saw veteran music composer M. S. Viswanathan make his acting debut in a supporting role, whilst the lead actress Maanu from Assam and music composer Bharadwaj also debuted. The film's soundtrack gained rave review prior to release. Viswanathan had initially waded away the approach but actor Vivek later convinced him to partake in the film. The film won positive reviews from critics, with a reviewer praising the film for tackling a taboo subject. The critic claimed that Ajith Kumar "was back at his best", whilst also crediting success to Maanu's performance and Bharadwaj's soundtrack. The film received a good response at the box office. The first copy was worth Rs 22 million, but was only sold for Rs 16 million. Despite all this, it ran 100 days and re-established Ajith Kumar's market after a string of failures. The producers of the previous collaboration of Ajith Kumar and Sarann during "Kadhal Mannan", Venkateswaralayam had lost a lot of money on that film so Ajith insisted on doing another film for the studio, "Amarkalam" (1999). Sarann initially approached Shalini, who was studying at the time and she refused but after a three-month pursuit, he finally got her to sign on as well. The role of Tulasi Das was initially offered to Amitabh Bachchan who accepted before later pulling out of the film. The film began production in January 1999 and during the production of the film, the lead pair Ajith Kumar and Shalini fell in love and eventually got married in April 2000. The film won predominantly positive reviews upon release with a reviewer describing the film as having an "okay storyline made very good because of its brilliant execution" whilst stating that the "climax is also very well-developed" and praising the performance of Ajith Kumar. The film went on to become a large commercial success at the box office, extending the lead actor Ajith Kumar's success after his previous film "Vaalee". Ajith went on to purchase Sarann a car as a token of gratitude for the success.
His next film was "Parthen Rasithen" (2000) with Prashanth and Simran (their third time pair after successful hits such as "Kannedhirey Thondrinal" and "Jodi"). which did well at the box office and Simran's performance was well praised by critics (her first Villainous role).
But his next film "Alli Arjuna" (2002) was a flop in spite of A. R. Rahman's compositions. Then he directed a film for Vikram in a production under AVM Productions in "Gemini" (2002), it became a mass success at the time, it made Vikram very popular and one of the hit film, Ajith neglect to act because of his Racing Career Then he directed "Jay Jay" (2003) with Madhavan which was a hit. After "Jay Jay", Saran works for the first time with Kamal Haasan in "Vasool Raja MBBS" (2004) which was a remake of the Hindi film "Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.". The film received positive reviews and was a commercial success. His next film is again with Ajith in "Attahasam" (2004) also this film became a commercial success. After this films Saran directed "Idhaya Thirudan" (2006) with Jayam Ravi and was produced by veteran Director K. Balachander, The film received mixed reviews and was later considered a flop at the Box-office. His next venture is "Vattaram" with Arya the film received positive reviews and was a hit at the box office.
In early 2007, Saran agreed terms to direct his second film with Kamal Haasan in the lead role, while also taking up the role of producer. Saran later sold the production rights of the move to Ayngaran International, a move which irked Kamal Haasan and his team. As a result, the actor opted out and the film was shelved. Later he directed "Modhi Vilayadu" (2009) starring Vinay Rai and Kajal Aggarwal, the film was released to mixed reviews and fared poorly at the box office. His next film is "Aasal" in which film Saran works once again with Ajith met with mixed reviews upon release but was an average at the box-office.
His next movie "Aayirathil Iruvar" starring Vinay Rai released in September 2017. His movie "Market Raja MBBS" with Arav was released in 2019.
Personal life.
Saran and his wife Subha have two kids Sanjanaa and Sanjith. His younger brother K. V. Guhan works as cinematographer in Tamil film industry.

As of January 1, 2024, it has a population of 24,842, spanning 9,000 households. It comprises 2.90km2 or 2.05% of Bundang-gu.
Name.
There are two theories on the etymology of Imae-dong, the first of which combines a local name for the fields along the river Tancheon, Imusudeul (이무술들), and the shape of the village which corresponds to a geomatic terminology, 'plum blossom falling to the ground' (매화낙지형; 梅花落地形), with "mae" (梅) being the "hanja" for plum blossom; the second is that there are two mountains peaks named Maejibong (매지봉; 梅址峰), thus Imae literally means 'two "Mae"s'.
A third etymology of Imae-dong comes from a local legend, which holds that the area was previously known as Imusul (이무술), and its residents, on one summer day, caught and killed a large fish that was revealed to be a snake, which was destined to ascend towards heaven. They were warned through a dream that they will be cursed, and was haunted by the nightly cries of the snake's mate, thus they all held a ritual for it, of which it was satisfied, and told villagers through their dreams that their daily lives would be unimpacted. The next day, they found out that two plum trees had grown on the site of the ritual, thus the name Imae.

Treaty of Berwick (1639)

The Treaty of Berwick (also known as the Peace of Berwick or the Pacification of Berwick) was an agreement between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland, signed on 18 June 1639, which ended the First Bishops' War.
Peace lasted less than a year before the outbreak of the Second Bishops' War in 1640.
War.
During the 1630s, King Charles I, who was king of both Scotland and England, had attempted religious reforms to the Church of Scotland. In 1638, to express their strong political opposition to these reforms, many people throughout Scotland signed the National Covenant. Supporters of this movement, known as Covenanters, gained political supremacy in Scotland and mobilised forces to oppose any attempt by the King, or any of his Royalist supporters in Scotland, to restore his authority.
By June 1638, inconclusive skirmishing had taken place in the north-east of Scotland between Covenanters and Royalists. At the same time, Scottish and English armies had mustered on either side of their mutual border, near the town of Berwick.
Negotiations and Terms.
Both sides had reasons to fear a battle and on 6 June, the King sent a page to the Scots army camp near Duns to propose talks. Negotiations formally began when a delegation of Scottish noblemen arrived at the King's camp near Berwick on 11 June. After a week of discussions, where Charles was an active participant, a treaty was concluded on 18 June. The Scots agreed to demobilise, free Royalist prisoners and restore royal property. Charles agreed, in turn, to withdraw English forces and, in order to resolve all disputed matters, he would call a General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in August, followed by a Scottish Parliament to ratify its decisions.
Aftermath.
Though both armies withdrew without a battle, the treaty had avoided any mention of the disputed issue of episcopacy, that is, whether the King could accept the Covenanters prior expulsion of bishops from the Church of Scotland and who had ultimate authority. The General Assembly which followed in August reaffirmed Covenanter policies and the Covenanter-dominated parliament which assembled afterwards passed acts ratifying these. Furthermore, the Parliament also refused to be dissolved by the King's representative. On hearing reports from Scotland, Charles was determined to continue the political struggle by force if necessary:
The treaty was rendered moot when conflict again broke out in the Second Bishops' War the following summer.

NCERT textbook controversies

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) is an apex resource organisation set up by the Government of India to assist and advise the central and state governments on academic matters related to school education.
The model textbooks published by the council for adoption by school systems across India have generated controversies over the years. They have been accused of reflecting the political views of the party in power in the Government of India. In particular, during the years of Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled governments, they were accused of "saffronising" Indian history (i.e., reflecting Hindu nationalist views) and engaging in historical revisionism. 
Background.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) was established in 1961 by the Government of India by combining a number of existing organisations. It is an autonomous body in principle. However, it is Government-funded and its Director is appointed by the Ministry of Education (formerly Ministry of Human Resource Development). In practice, the NCERT has operated as a semi-official organisation promoting a "State-sponsored" educational philosophy.
In the early 1960s, national integration and unifying the various communities of India became a major concern to the Government. Education was seen as an important vehicle for the emotional integration of the nation. The Minister of Education M. C. Chagla was concerned that the textbooks in history should not recite myths but be secular and rational explanations of the past. A committee on history education was established with the membership of Tara Chand, Nilakanta Sastri, Mohammad Habib, Bisheshwar Prasad, B. P. Saxena and P. C. Gupta, which commissioned a number of history textbooks to be authored by the leading historians. Romila Thapar's "Ancient India" for class VI was published in 1966, "Medieval India" for class VII in 1967. A number of other books, Ram Sharan Sharma's "Ancient India", Satish Chandra's "Medieval India", Bipan Chandra's "Modern India" and Arjun Dev's "India and the World" were published in 1970's.
The textbooks faced political pressures from the inception. In 1969, a Parliamentary Consultative Committee wanted the textbook on "Ancient India" to state categorically that the "Aryans" were indigenous to India. But the demand was rejected by the editorial board as well as Thapar as the author. Further critical reactions came from Hindu and Sikh religious organisations that their respective religions and religious leaders had not been glorified. The Hindu Mahasabha and Arya Samaj claimed that the mention of beef-eating in ancient times went counter to the religious sentiments of the "Hindu nationality."
Such controversies continue till today. The controversy centers around the charges of an attempted "saffronised" rewriting of Indian history (i.e., making lessons consonant with the Hindutva). Allegations of historical revisionism with a Hindu nationalist agenda arose several times: under the Janata Party government 1977 to 1980 and again under the Bharatiya Janata Party government from 1998 to 2004 and from 2014 to the present.
Controversy during the Janata Party government (1977-1979).
Three months into the Janata Party government headed by Morarji Desai, the Prime Minister was handed an anonymous memorandum by Nanaji Deshmukh, former Jana Sangh leader and general secretary of the Janata Party, which targeted the NCERT textbooks. The books criticised were Thapar's "Medieval India" and Bipan Chandra's "Modern India", along with two other books, "Freedom Struggle" by Tripathi, De and Chandra, and "Communalism and the Writing of Indian History" by Thapar, Mukhia and Chandra. (Only the first two were NCERT textbooks.) The Prime Minister forwarded the memorandum to the Education Minister suggesting that the books be withdrawn from circulation. In August 1977, R. S. Sharma's "Ancient India" was published, which was also targeted. The books were labelled to be "anti-Indian and anti-national" in content and "prejudicial to the study of history." The main issues seemed to be that they were not sufficiently critical of certain Muslim invaders during the medieval period and that they emphasized the role of leaders like Tilak and Aurobindo in the development of Hindu-Muslim antagonisms. The Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh launched a separate campaign against the books in its magazine "Organiser".
The memorandum got leaked and a public debate ensued, which ran till 1979. The authors of the books argued for the legitimacy of independent interpretations as long as they were based on reliable evidence. The most hotly contested issue in the 1977 to 1979 controversy was the depiction of Mughal era (Muslim rule) India and the role of Islam in India. In November 1977, a committee of reputable historians was asked to examine the textbooks, which supported their continuance. Nonetheless, the government passed an act in July 1978, withdrawing R. S. Sharma's "Ancient India" from the syllabus of the Central Board of Secondary Education.
Changes in content (2002-2004).
In 2002, under the NDA government spearheaded by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) the government made an attempt at changing the NCERT school textbooks through a new National Curriculum Framework. Liberal historians raised objections to the new curriculum, claiming "saffronisation" of education by allegedly raising the profile of Hindutva cultural norms, views and historical personalities in school textbooks. The BJP opined that their only goal was to overhaul the stagnant and saturated institutions like NCERT and free them from the alleged dynastic control and hegemony of the Indian National Congress and the Communists. Party members also opined that their goal was not to promote sectarianism, but present a more accurate picture of Indian history and Indian culture (such as Vedic science), which they said was being downplayed by the left wing ideologues. NCERT also attracted plagiarism accusations in 2003 mainly from the Frontline Magazine published by The Hindu. "Contemporary World History", a textbook for Class XII, has been found to contain several sections lifted from "World Civilizations - Their History and Their Culture" authored by Edward MacNall Burns, Philip Lee Ralph, Robert E. Lerner and Standish Meacham. The latter book, published by American publishers W.W. Norton &amp; Company Inc, has a special Indian edition, which is the only authorised, complete and unabridged reprint of the latest American edition.
The NDA was defeated in the elections of 2004 and the new UPA government pledged to "de-saffronise" textbooks and curricula nationwide and restore the secular character of education. In March, the UPA Government released new NCERT textbooks, based on the texts used before the controversial 2002 updates. The Ministry of Human Resource Development, which oversaw this project, stated that it had made only minor modifications to the books that predated the "saffronised" era. In Delhi, the Directorate of Education, in collaboration with the State Council of Educational Research and Training, prepared 47 new textbooks, and other state governments were expected to do likewise. In June 2004, a panel, composed of J. S. Grewal, Barun De and S. Settar, was constituted by the NCERT to review the new textbooks. This panel suggested that the textbooks that were being used in school syllabuses had poor content, were presented shoddily, and contained significant amounts of irrelevant information. The panel recommended, to the Human Resource Development (HRD) minister, that the new books not be used until the defects could be resolved. This led the Delhi students to use textbooks that were used in school syllabuses from the pre-"saffronised" period.
Press reports indicated that the rush to "de-saffronise" school texts resulted in Urdu versions not being ready for the academic year, which began in April. The reports asserted that this failure hurt Urdu-speaking students by depriving them of needed textbooks. The NCERT however denied these claims.
Controversies during UPA government (2004-2014).
In 2006, the NCERT decided to amend a paragraph in its Class XII history textbook, "Modern India," after Sikh organizations protested "objectionable" references to Guru Gobind Singh. The original paragraph said that Emperor Bahadur Shah tried to "conciliate the rebellious Sikhs" by making peace with Guru Gobind Singh and offering him a high mansab.The revised version changed this to state that Sikhs raised a revolt under Guru Gobind Singh in the early 18th century, and after his death, under Banda Bahadur. The CBSE subsequently instructed schools to use the new paragraph and not to teach the original. 
In 2012, there were protests for removal of controversial cartoon on anti-Hindi agitation in Tamil Nadu. Protests were held by Republican Party of India and other political parties against a cartoon on Ambedkar published in an eleventh grade text book.
In April 2012, The Republican Party of India (RPI) Athavale group demanded a ban on an eleventh grade text book by the NCERT saying a drawn cartoon in the book insulted B. R. Ambedkar. The originally published book in 2006 wasn't recognized as part of the syllabus until 2012. On 2 April, Ramdas Athavale held a press conference and burnt copies of the page from the textbook prescribed in the political-civic science syllabus. Athavale demanded the resignation of Union Minister for Human Resource Development Kapil Sibal who also was the president of the NCERT board. RPI workers burnt his effigy. The cartoon figures on page 18 of chapter one titled "Constitution, why and how" in the book called "Indian Constitution at Work". It shows Ambedkar sitting on a snail which is labelled ‘Constitution' cracking a whip. Behind him is Pandit Nehru, also shown with a whip. The caption says: "Cartoonist's impression of the ‘snail's pace' with which the Constitution was made." Athavale said the cartoon insulted the architect of India's Constitution and the people responsible must be dealt with. The NCERT too had insulted him, he pointed out. The issue created uproar in both Houses of Parliament. NCERT chief advisors Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar resigned on Friday after the government issued an apology and promised to remove the cartoon. Speaking to reporters, Palshikar said it seemed like the government didn't have an option and therefore decided to agree with the protesting MPs. "The caricature was a symbol of the progressive outlook in education. This has now been undone. We are of the opinion that as advisors we can have a different opinion. Hence, we don't think it's appropriate for us to be in this position anymore."
Soon after that controversy had been solved, the Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri Mosque, Mohd. Mukarram Ahmed wrote to Kapil Sibal asking to remove a medieval painting of Gabriel the Archangel and another of pilgrims at the Kaaba from the chapter 'The Central Islamic Lands' on the ground that they were against Sharia. The letter, dated 10 September 2012 has also been sent to Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, education minister Kiran Walia and NCERT chief Parvin Sinclair. "Jibreell (Gabriel) is the chief angel who brought messages to the Islamic prophet. The painting in the book is comical in its presentation of the Archangel. Secondly, the caption for the illustration on pilgrims at the Kaba states that they are 'touching' the stone even though it's customary to kiss it. But the Jibril painting is the most objectionable and will not be tolerated," said Ahmed in his letter. However, rejecting this, Najaf Haider, an associate professor at the Centre for Historical Studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University said "The Gabriel painting was sourced from a 13th century text called "Aja'ib al-Makhluqat", written by a renowned scholar, Qazwini. The second illustration was taken from a 15th century collection of fragmented pieces. The letter only states the paintings are against Sharia and doesn't exactly point out what's objectionable about them. Moreover, these texts (from where the paintings are sourced) were written in Muslim courts by people who were far more scholarly and pious than anyone can claim to be today."
Changes in content during the BJP government (2014–present).
The poem "Sabse Khatarnak" by the Hindi poet Pash was included in the NCERT textbook for 11th grade Hindi students in 2006. In 2017, the BJP government affiliated RSS tried to remove it but failed.
The NCERT made two controversial changes to the class XII political science textbook "‘Politics in India Since Independence’" in 2017. It changed a heading of a passage describing the 2002 Gujarat riots from ‘Anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat’ to just ‘Gujarat riots’. In another class XII textbook titled ‘"Contemporary World Politics"’ the Aksai Chin region was shown to be a disputed area and coloured in the same colour as China. According to the NCERT, the controversial map was not a map of India, but a map of East and South East Asia published by University of Texas at Austin. The map was replaced after a few months following media scrutiny.
Before the commencement of the 2019–20 academic year, NCERT's decided to cut significant chapters from its Class IX history textbook: on clothing and caste conflicts; the history of cricket; and the impact of colonial capitalism on peasants and farmers. Similarly from the Class X History textbook, chapters on 'The Nationalist Movement in Indo-China', 'Work, Life and Leisure - Cities in the Contemporary World', and ‘Novels, Society and History’ had been deleted. NCERT's director Hrushikesh Senapaty highlighted that students must have time to engage outdoor. The syllabus of Social Sciences, which covers History, Geography, Political Science, and Economics, had 24 chapters in Class IX as compared to 15 each in Science and Mathematics. Similarly, Class X Social Sciences had 28 chapters as compared to 16 each in Science and Mathematics. This exercise brought down the total number of chapters in Social Sciences in Class IX and X to 20 and 25 respectively.
On May 2021, a controversy arose on social media over a poem in a Class 1 NCERT Hindi textbook. The poem, titled "Aam ki tokri" (Basket of Mangoes), was criticized for its use of the slang term "chhokri" for a girl and for allegedly promoting child labor. An IAS officer, Awanish Sharan, started the ruckus by calling for the poem's removal. However, NCERT defended the poem, stating it was meant to expose children to local languages. Experts were divided on the issue; some believed the term "chhokri" was not derogatory and the poem's purpose was to teach phonetics, while others felt the depiction of a child selling goods was insensitive in today's context.
After the COVID-19 pandemic, the NCERT performed the rationalisation exercise saying that it will reduce the curriculum load on students. The council stated that a key objective was to facilitate a speedy recovery from learning losses and compensate for lost time during the pandemic. In addition to this, the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasized reducing content load to encourage a more holistic and creative learning approach over rote memorisation. NCERT also stated that the changes addressed overlapping content, material with a high difficulty level, and topics that were irrelevant or easily accessible to students through self-learning.
The rationalisation heavily focused on removing Islamic history from the textbooks which was controversial. The BJP party and many of its politicians like Kapil Mishra welcomed the move to eliminate part of the Mughal history from course books. This action attracted severe criticism from various factions of the Indian political arena. The removed chapter was related to ‘Kings and Chronicles; the Mughal Courts (C. 16th and 17th centuries)’ from the book ‘Themes of Indian History-Part II’ of Class 12.
From the Class 11th History syllabus, chapters like Central Islamic Lands, Confrontation of cultures, and The Industrial Revolution were removed. Apart from this, from Class 12 civics book Politics in India since Independence, chapter like The Rise of popular movements was removed while references to controversies regarding Emergency along with "Khalistan" were also removed. Also chapters like "The Cold War Era" and "US Hegemony in World Politics" were removed from another class 12th civics book "Contemporary World Politics". From the class 10 Democratic Politics-II textbooks, chapters like ‘Democracy and diversity’, ‘Popular struggles and movement’, ‘Challenges to democracy’ have been removed.
From the Class 12 political science and history textbooks references such as the “dislike of Hindu extremists for Mahatma Gandhi’s pursuit of Hindu-Muslim unity” and banning of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) after his assassination were removed. A comparison of the new Class 12 political science textbook titled “Politics in India since Independence” with its older version showed that a reference to how Gandhi's “steadfast pursuit of Hindu-Muslim unity provoked Hindu extremists so much that they made several attempts to assassinate Gandhiji” has also been deleted from the sub-topic titled “Mahatma Gandhi’s sacrifice” in the first chapter. Gandhi was “particularly disliked by those who wanted Hindus to take revenge or who wanted India to become a country for the Hindus, just as Pakistan was for Muslims” has also been deleted. The references to the crackdown on organisations spreading communal hatred, the ban on RSS for some time, and the loss of appeal of communal politics, too, have been removed.
References to Dalit writer Omprakash Valmiki were removed from the social science textbooks of Classes 7 and 8 as part of the latest revision. In the Class 7 textbook topic titled “Our Pasts-2”, pages 48 and 49 were excluded. These pages mentioned “Mughal Emperors: Major campaigns and events.”
In the Class 6 history textbook, "Our Pasts – I", sentences on the hereditary nature of varnas, classification of people as untouchables and rejection of the varna system were removed from the chapter "Kingdom, Kings and Early Republic".
The deletions also affected Biology and Chemistry textbooks as the theory of evolution and the periodic table were also purged from class 10 NCERT textbooks.
After the Chandrayaan-3 moon landing, the NCERT released a reading module titled 'Chandrayaan Utsav' for middle-school students which drew scientific criticism for linking the Chandrayaan-3 mission with mythology. The module suggested that ancient Indian texts, like the 'Vaimānika Shāstra,' contained knowledge of flying vehicles. This drew criticism from the scientific community, which demanded the module's withdrawal. Scientists pointed out that a study by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) showed the concepts in the 'Vaimānika Shāstra' were not aerodynamically sound, and a plane built on them would not fly. Former ISRO Chairman G. Madhavan Nair also stated that there was no physical evidence to support these mythological claims, calling them "scientific fiction." The Breakthrough Science Society (BSS) also joined in the criticism, demanding that the government stop presenting mythology as historical fact. The NCERT initially withdrew the reading module after the controversy erupted but re-introduced it after the governent defended the content, stating that mythology and philosophy put forward ideas that lead to innovation. Reports also claimed that the 17-page module excessively focused on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's role rather than on the contributions of ISRO and consistently referred to the country as 'Bharat' instead of India.
In April 2024, the NCERT revised its Political Science curriculum for grades 11 and 12. The revisions resulted in the omission of references to several contentious events in Indian history, including the Babri Masjid demolition, the Gujarat riots, and the role of Hindutva in Indian politics. The NCERT justified these changes as routine updates to reflect the government's current stance. Critics, however, argued that the revisions were politically motivated and aimed at downplaying the role of these events in shaping modern India. Also in its Class 12 history and sociology textbooks, the NCERT introduced significant changes, particularly regarding the Harappan civilization and the Aryan migration theory. These changes drew both support and criticism for their departure from long-held academic views. The updated history textbook now casts doubt on the Aryan migration theory by suggesting that the Harappans were an indigenous people whose DNA has an "unbroken continuity for 5,000 years" with a majority of the present-day South Asian population. A sentence suggesting a break between the Early Harappan and later Harappan civilizations was removed. A new paragraph was added to assert the "unbroken continuity" of the Harappan people, stating that their genetic roots go back to 10,000 BCE. In the sociology textbook, a section on Adivasi struggles was altered to remove the claim that SCs and STs are marked by poverty, powerlessness, and social stigma. An image of communal riots was removed from a book. The phrase "caste backgrounds" was changed to "social backgrounds."
Between 2023 and 2025, the NCERT gave Hindi titles to several of its new English-medium textbooks. Critics, including Kerala's Education Minister V. Sivankutty, viewed the move as an "illogicality" and "cultural imposition," arguing that it undermined linguistic diversity and federal principles. However, NCERT explained that the new names were chosen "thoughtfully to convey rootedness in India's culture." This decision broke from the long-standing tradition of matching the book title to the language of instruction and was seen by some as an attempt to promote Hindi in non-Hindi-speaking states. The name changes include:
In its April 2025 textbook release, NCERT removed all references to the Mughal dynasty and the Delhi Sultanate from the Class 7 social science textbooks. The content on dynasties such as the Tughlaq, Khalji, Mamluk, and Lodi was dropped. In their place, new chapters were added that focus on ancient Indian rulers, including the Magadha, Maurya, Shunga, and Satavahanas. The revised curriculum also introduced a new chapter titled "How the Land Becomes Sacred," which covers sacred and pilgrimage sites across India. Additionally, references to the Maha Kumbh and various central government initiatives were included.
On July 16, 2025, NCERT released a revised Class 8 Social Science textbook that sparked significant controversy. The book described Babur as a “brutal and ruthless conqueror, slaughtering entire populations of cities,” Akbar as a ruler whose reign combined both brutality and tolerance—including ordering the massacre of some 30,000 civilians at Chittorgarh—while Aurangzeb was portrayed as a military ruler who destroyed temples and gurdwaras, reinstated jizya, and exhibited religious intolerance. To contextualize these portrayals, NCERT included a “Note on Some Darker Periods in History” which clarified that students today should not be held accountable for historical atrocities, and urged them to engage with history dispassionately. These descriptions were criticized by academics and educators for promoting a communal and ideologically skewed view of medieval history. The textbook also referred to “many instances of religious intolerance” during the medieval period, especially under Mughal rule. NCERT said that it aimed to highlight both the bright and dark sides of historical periods, but critics said the emphasis was clearly placed on Mughal atrocities.
Also, references to Tipu Sultan, Hyder Ali and the four Anglo–Mysore Wars were removed. These figures, once central in older editions, were replaced by a broader focus on topics such as Vasco da Gama’s arrival, the Battle of Plassey, colonial economic exploitation, and tribal uprisings.
In August 2025, Chaitanya Raj Singh Bhati, King (Maharawal) of the erstwhile kingdom of Jaisalmer criticized a map in NCERT’s Class 8 Social Science textbook that showed Jaisalmer as part of the Maratha Empire. He called it “historically misleading and baseless,” saying there was no record of Maratha rule or taxation in Jaisalmer. Other Rajasthan royals supported his objection. Due to this, the NCERT set up an expert committee to review the content.
Before the Independence Day in 2025, a new NCERT module named 'Partition Horrors' was released which started a significant controversy, as it blamed three key parties for the division. The module, intended for secondary stage students, specifically stated that the culprits were Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who demanded the Partition; the Indian National Congress, which accepted it; and then-Viceroy Lord Mountbatten, who implemented it. The module even asserted that the Partition was not inevitable and that Congress leaders like Nehru and Patel accepted it out of fear of civil war. The Congress party sharply criticized the module's narrative. A party spokesperson, Pawan Khera, called for the document to be "torn up" because it did not mention the role of the Hindu Mahasabha, which he claimed first suggested the idea of separate nations for Hindus and Muslims in 1938. He also stated that the Partition was the result of a "nexus between Hindu Mahasabha and Muslim League." On August 19, the Congress-affiliated National Students' Union of India (NSUI) protested at Delhi University's Faculty of Arts against the what it termed as the RSS-BJP's hateful and distorted NCERT module.
Criticism.
According to S. Irfan Habib, a historian, the rewriting of history is in line with the BJP's attempts to impose its Hindu nationalist propaganda. Habib said, “politicisation of students’ textbooks leads to the polarisation of the country by presenting a skewed past". He further called it "a conscious act by the present government to pursue agendas to further the religious divide in India by brainwashing young kids. The current government is assaulting the ethos of India by poisoning the school curriculum”.
According to Apoorvanand, a University of Delhi professor, Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government "seeks to portray India as a historically Hindu-only land". He adds, "marginalisation of Mughals and Muslims in textbooks mirrors what Muslims in Modi’s India are facing in real life. The recent textbook edits are part of a cultural genocide".
According to Audrey Truschke, a historian at Rutgers University, "erasing Mughals from textbooks does not erase them from India’s history". According to Harbans Mukhia, a historian of medieval India, the Modi-led BJP is using a strategy to win the next general elections in 2024 by unifying the Hindu vote by way of attaching the narrative that Hindus are under threat from Muslims.
According to Aditya Mukherjee, a professor of contemporary Indian history, the removal of Mughal history from the textbook was an attempt to erase history of a particular community, which is usually followed by a genocide of the community.
According to Suhas Palshikar, a political scientist, the deletion exercise is an "act of rewriting" adding that the BJP government intends "not to mention inconvenient facts".
According to Romila Thapar, NCERT's revised history textbooks presents a politicized and distorted version of India's past. She criticized the deletion of entire chapters and specific information, such as those related to the Mughal court and certain aspects of ancient Indian society, which she argued was an attempt to create a communal and one-sided historical narrative. Thapar believes this move undermined the principles of objective and evidence-based historical study, which she saw as crucial for a proper education. She maintains that the changes were part of a broader political agenda to promote a specific ideology rather than a genuine effort to improve the curriculum.
Around 1800 scientists, educators, science teachers, science popularizers, and citizens from various reputable institutions criticized the removal of Darwin's theory of evolution from NCERT textbooks, saying that the purging of foundational science chapters will seriously handicap students' thought process. They wrote an open letter to the government urging it to continue teaching theory of evolution.
Suhas Palshikar and Yogendra Yadav, who were chief advisors for the political science books said they were "embarrassed to be associated with these textbooks" after rationalization of NCERT books and wrote a letter to the NCERT seeking removal of their names from political science books.
Dr Ruchika Sharma, a JNU historian specialising in medieval Indian history, said NCERT’s revised textbooks misrepresented Akbar and the jizya, claimed they advanced historically incorrect assertions, and announced she would file an RTI to demand the sources and process behind the changes.

1945 (Gingrich and Forstchen novel)

1945 is an alternate history novel written by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen in 1995 that described the period immediately after World War II in which the United States had fought only against Japan, which allowed Nazi Germany to force a truce with the Soviet Union, and the two victors confront each other in a Cold War, which swiftly turns hot.
Plot.
At the start of the novel, the United States, having defeated the Empire of Japan, is in no mood to enter a new war, and Americans accept the "fait accompli" of German domination over most of Europe. A Cold War seems in the offing, and even the British, with a German-dominated Europe at their doorstep, squander much of their resources on a colonial war in the former French Indochina.
US President Andrew Harrison (a fictional character) has a summit with Adolf Hitler in Reykjavík, Iceland. The meeting goes badly, both leaders sharply confront each other, and Hitler secretly decides to accelerate preparations for a surprise attack on both the United States and the United Kingdom. As part of the preparations, a beautiful German spy seduces and suborns the White House Chief of Staff and makes him a key German spy.
The book's protagonist, Lieutenant Commander James Martel, at the incipient Head of Naval Intelligence at the American embassy in Berlin, is one of the few who suspects the gathering storm by watching the new weapons displayed at the parade commemorating Germany's victory over the Soviet Union and encountering the well-known commando Otto Skorzeny, who is his main opponent throughout the book.
Skorzeny makes meticulous secret preparations for raids to destroy the American atomic bomb programs at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory. (During the book's war with Japan, the Manhattan Project was put on the back burner, making the 1945 United States far from already possessing a nuclear bomb.) The bulk of the book is devoted to Martel, who was back in the United States, getting a glimmer of the threatened attack and unsuccessfully trying to sound a warning.
The German raid takes place, and though the Germans are eventually beaten back – Tennessee's Alvin York shows up, and, despite being no longer young, gives a good account of himself – the raid causes great damage by killing key scientists and setting the American nuclear program behind Germany's. The Germans also seize the uranium mines in the Congo region while they launch an all-out war against the United Kingdom.
The book ends with a cliffhanger. Erwin Rommel invades Scotland, the British face a desperate fight, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill implores the Americans to "come quickly, this is much worse than 1940."
A promised sequel has failed to appear as of 2025.
Reception.
A review in the "Chicago Tribune" said, "The story isn't the biggest problem; it's the pages of putrid prose that make the book so tough to stomach." A 1996 review in "The Washington Post" commented that "for every 100 copies that his hopeful publisher sent forth into the world, 81 came back, unsold." It also noted good reviews in the "National Review", the "Atlanta Journal-Constitution" and "Asimov's Science Fiction".

IOK-1 is a distant galaxy in the constellation Coma Berenices. When discovered in 2006, it was the oldest and most distant galaxy ever found, at redshift 6.96.
It was discovered in April 2006 by Masanori Iye at National Astronomical Observatory of Japan using the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii and is seen as it was 12.88 billion years ago. Its emission of Lyman alpha radiation has a redshift of 6.96, corresponding to just 750 million years after the Big Bang. While some scientists have claimed other objects (such as Abell 1835 IR1916) to be even older, the IOK-1's age and composition have been more reliably established.

Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone

The Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (CANWFZ) treaty is a legally binding commitment by Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan not to manufacture, acquire, test, or possess nuclear weapons. The treaty was signed on 8 September 2006 at Semipalatinsk Test Site, Kazakhstan, and is also known as Treaty of Semipalatinsk, Treaty of Semei, or Treaty of Semey.
The treaty was ratified by Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan Tajikistan and Kazakhstan,
and entered into force 21 March 2009.
History.
Steps towards the establishment of such a zone began with the Almaty Declaration in 1992. A resolution calling for the establishment of such a zone was adopted by consensus by the United Nations General Assembly in 1997 and reaffirmed in 2000.
Mindful of the lack of support by the nuclear powers for a similar Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, the five permanent members of the Security Council were involved in the negotiations. 
While Russia and China approved of the treaty, United States, France and United Kingdom objected to a clause which stated that the Treaty would not affect the rights and obligations of the signatories under previous international agreements because of the already existent Tashkent Treaty which involved Russia.
The United States also objected on principle to establishment of any zone disturbing "existing security arrangements to the detriment of regional and international security or otherwise abridg[ing] the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense guaranteed in the UN charter".
The United States also objected to possibility that Iran could apply to join the Treaty, so this provision was removed.
The United States, United Kingdom, and France were finally concerned about the possibility that the Treaty could forbid the transit of nuclear weapons through the territory.
In spite of attempts by United States, United Kingdom, and France to block the Treaty, it was finally signed in September 2006, although they voted against the General Assembly Resolution which welcomed the signing of the treaty in December 2006.
All five Permanent Members of the Security Council (also the five NPT nuclear weapons states) signed the Protocol to the treaty on May 6, 2014, which provides legally binding assurances not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against CANWFZ Treaty parties.
As of May 2016 all Permanent Members of the Security Council except the United States have ratified the protocols.

The Brides of Fu Manchu

The Brides of Fu Manchu is a 1966 British/West German Constantin Film co-production adventure crime film based on the fictional Chinese villain Dr. Fu Manchu, created by Sax Rohmer. It was the second film in a series, and was preceded by "The Face of Fu Manchu". "The Vengeance of Fu Manchu" followed in 1967, "The Blood of Fu Manchu" in 1968, and "The Castle of Fu Manchu" in 1969. It was produced by Harry Alan Towers for Hallam Productions. Like the first film, it was directed by Don Sharp, and starred Christopher Lee as Fu Manchu. Nigel Green was replaced by Douglas Wilmer as Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith.
The action takes place mainly in London, where much of the location filming took place.
Plot.
In 1924, Dr. Fu Manchu, his army of dacoits and his vicious daughter Lin Tang are kidnapping the daughters of prominent scientists and taking them to his hidden base in the Atlas Mountains, where he demands that their fathers help him to build a device that transmits blast waves through a radio transmitter, which he intends to use to take over the world. He plans to keep (even wed) the girls in question. But Dr. Fu Manchu's archenemy, Nayland Smith of Scotland Yard, is determined not to let that happen.
Cast.
Credits adapted from the booklet of the Powerhouse Films Blu-ray boxset "The Fu Manchu Cycle: 1965-1969".
The Brides of Fu Manchu 
Production.
Sharp recalled producer Harry Alan Towers used the film to showcase "young and beautiful actresses". It was shot at Bray Film Studios (UK). Nigel Green was not available to repeat his performance as Nayland Smith so he was replaced by Douglas Wilmer. Sharp recalled filming went "smoothly but already the signs were there that" Towers could make Fu Manchu movies without having to "worry too much because the stories were okay. Well, there was more to making the movies than that."

Hunting the clean boot

Hunting the clean boot, also called clean boot hunting, is a term that has been used in the United Kingdom to refer to the use of packs of bloodhounds to follow a natural human scent trail.
The term 'clean boot' refers to the absence of either an artificial scent such as aniseed, as used in drag hunting, or animal urine, as used in trail hunting. Whilst today the term has become synonymous with the use of bloodhound packs, most breeds of dog can be taught the skill individually with varying degrees of success.
Typically, clean boot hunts are run along similar lines to fox hunting (now prohibited in Great Britain), with a field of mounted riders following a pack of bloodhounds which trails the scent of a runner. Like other forms of mounted hunting with hounds, hunting the clean boot usually occurs in the autumn, winter and early spring.
In order to improve the speed, agility and pack hunting instincts of the bloodhound, the Dumfriesshire Hound was used by several packs as an outcross.

Christian Rivers

Christian Rivers is a New Zealand storyboard artist, visual effects supervisor, special effects technician, and director. He first met Peter Jackson as a 17-year-old, and storyboarded all of Jackson's films since "Braindead". He made his directing debut in the film adaptation of "Mortal Engines", and planning a remake of "The Dam Busters", both produced by Peter Jackson.
Career.
Rivers started his career by storyboarding Peter Jackson's "Braindead" right after finishing high school. He has since then continued to work for Jackson on storyboards, special effects, visual effects and splinter unit directing on "The Hobbit" trilogy. On "King Kong," he directed the previz of the fight between King Kong and the three V-rexes. The sequence was used as the blueprint for the final version, giving Rivers a direction credit for the scene. For his work on "King Kong", he won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.
Rivers went on directing his first short film, "Feeder", and second unit directing on the 2016 remake of "Pete's Dragon".
In December 2009, it was stated that the New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson intended to make a movie based on "Mortal Engines". On 25 October 2016, Peter Jackson announced that WingNut Films has started work on producing a feature film to be directed by Christian Rivers. The script has been written by Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. The movie was financed by MRC and Universal, and shooting on "Mortal Engines" got underway in March 2017 in New Zealand. Producers Zane Weiner and Amanda Walker, who both worked on "The Hobbit", will be spearheading the NZ based team, along with Deborah Forte in the US.
The film premiered on 27 November 2018. It premiered worldwide on 14 December 2018, received generally mixed reviews and was a box office bomb.
Future projects.
Work on a remake of "The Dam Busters", produced by Peter Jackson and directed by first time director Christian Rivers, began in 2008. Jackson said in the mid-1990s that he became interested in remaking the 1955 film, but found that the rights had been bought by Mel Gibson. In 2004, Jackson was contacted by his agent, who said Gibson had dropped the rights. In December 2005, the rights were purchased by David Frost, from the Brickhill family. Stephen Fry wrote the script.
In March 2007, it was announced it will be distributed by Universal Pictures, and StudioCanal. Filming was planned to commence in early 2009, on a budget of US$40 million, although no project specific filming had begun by May 2009. The project was delayed because Jackson decided to make "The Hobbit".
Weta Workshop was making the models and special effects for the film and had made 10 life size Lancaster bombers. Fry said Wing Commander Guy Gibson's dog "Nigger" will be called "Digger" in the remake so as to avoid controversy, despite the historical inaccuracy. Les Munro, a pilot in the strike team, joined the production crew in Masterton as technical advisor. Jackson was also to use newly declassified War Office documents to ensure the authenticity of the film.
After Munro died in August 2015, Phil Bonner of the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre said he still thinks Jackson will eventually make the film, citing Jackson's passion for aviation. Jackson said, "There is only a limited span I can abide, of people driving me nuts asking me when I'm going to do that project. So I'll have to do it. I want to, actually, it's one of the truly great true stories of the Second World War, a wonderful, wonderful story."

Ordered Bell number

In number theory and enumerative combinatorics, the ordered Bell numbers or Fubini numbers count the weak orderings on a set of formula_1 elements. Weak orderings arrange their elements into a sequence allowing ties, such as might arise as the outcome of a horse race.
The ordered Bell numbers were studied in the 19th century by Arthur Cayley and William Allen Whitworth. They are named after Eric Temple Bell, who wrote about the Bell numbers, which count the partitions of a set; the ordered Bell numbers count partitions that have been equipped with a total order. Their alternative name, the Fubini numbers, comes from a connection to Guido Fubini and Fubini's theorem on equivalent forms of multiple integrals. Because weak orderings have many names, ordered Bell numbers may also be called by those names, for instance as the numbers of preferential arrangements or the numbers of asymmetric generalized weak orders.
These numbers may be computed via a summation formula involving binomial coefficients, or by using a recurrence relation. They also count combinatorial objects that have a bijective correspondence to the weak orderings, such as the ordered multiplicative partitions of a squarefree number or the faces of all dimensions of a permutohedron.
Definitions and examples.
Weak orderings arrange their elements into a sequence allowing ties. This possibility describes various real-world scenarios, including certain sporting contests such as horse races. A weak ordering can be formalized axiomatically by a partially ordered set for which incomparability is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes of this relation partition the elements of the ordering into subsets of mutually tied elements, and these equivalence classes can then be linearly ordered by the weak ordering. Thus, a weak ordering can be described as an ordered partition, a partition of its elements and a total order on the sets of the partition. For instance, the ordered partition {"a","b"},{"c"},{"d","e","f"} describes an ordered partition on six elements in which "a" and "b" are tied and both less than the other four elements, and "c" is less than "d", "e", and "f", which are all tied with each other.
The formula_1th ordered Bell number, denoted here formula_3, gives the number of distinct weak orderings on formula_1 elements. For instance, there are three weak orderings on the two elements "a" and "b": they can be ordered with "a" before "b", with "b" before "a", or with both tied. The figure shows the 13 weak orderings on three elements.
Starting from formula_5, the ordered Bell numbers formula_3 are
When the elements to be ordered are unlabeled (only the number of elements in each tied set matters, not their identities) what remains is a composition or ordered integer partition, a representation of formula_1 as an ordered sum of positive integers. For instance, the ordered partition {"a","b"},{"c"},{"d","e","f"} discussed above corresponds in this way to the composition 2 + 1 + 3. The number of compositions of formula_1 is exactly formula_9. This is because a composition is determined by its set of partial sums, which may be any subset of the integers from 1 to formula_10.
History.
The ordered Bell numbers appear in the work of , who used them to count certain plane trees with formula_11 totally ordered leaves. In the trees considered by Cayley, each root-to-leaf path has the same length, and the number of nodes at distance formula_12 from the root must be strictly smaller than the number of nodes at distance formula_13, until reaching the leaves. In such a tree, there are formula_1 pairs of adjacent leaves, that may be weakly ordered by the height of their lowest common ancestor; this weak ordering determines the tree. call the trees of this type "Cayley trees", and they call the sequences that may be used to label their gaps (sequences of formula_1 positive integers that include at least one copy of each positive integer between one and the maximum value in the sequence) "Cayley permutations".
 traces the problem of counting weak orderings, which has the same sequence as its solution, to the work of . These numbers were called Fubini numbers by Louis Comtet, because they count the different ways to rearrange the ordering of sums or integrals in Fubini's theorem, which in turn is named after Guido Fubini. The Bell numbers, named after Eric Temple Bell, count the partitions of a set, and the weak orderings that are counted by the ordered Bell numbers may be interpreted as a partition together with a total order on the sets in the partition.
The equivalence between counting Cayley trees and counting weak orderings was observed in 1970 by Donald Knuth, using an early form of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). This became one of the first successful uses of the OEIS to discover equivalences between different counting problems.
Formulas.
Summation.
Because weak orderings can be described as total orderings on the subsets of a partition, one can count weak orderings by counting total orderings and partitions, and combining the results appropriately. The Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted formula_16, count the partitions of an formula_1-element set into formula_18 nonempty subsets. A weak ordering may be obtained from such a partition by choosing one of formula_19 total orderings of its subsets. Therefore, the ordered Bell numbers can be counted by summing over the possible numbers of subsets in a partition (the parameter formula_18) and, for each value of formula_18, multiplying the number of partitions formula_16 by the number of total orderings formula_19. That is, as a summation formula:
formula_24
By general results on summations involving Stirling numbers, it follows that the ordered Bell numbers are log-convex, meaning that they obey the inequality formula_25 for all formula_26.
An alternative interpretation of the terms of this sum is that they count the features of each dimension in a permutohedron of dimension formula_1, with the formula_18th term counting the features of dimension formula_29. A permutohedron is a convex polytope, the convex hull of points whose coordinate vectors are the permutations of the numbers from 1 to formula_1. These vectors are defined in a space of dimension formula_11, but they and their convex hull all lie in an formula_1-dimensional affine subspace. For instance, the three-dimensional permutohedron is the truncated octahedron, the convex hull of points whose coordinates are permutations of (1,2,3,4), in the three-dimensional subspace of points whose coordinate sum is 10. This polyhedron has one volume (formula_33), 14 two-dimensional faces (formula_34), 36 edges (formula_35), and 24 vertices (formula_36). The total number of these faces is 1 + 14 + 36 + 24 = 75, an ordered Bell number, corresponding to the summation formula above for formula_37.
By expanding each Stirling number in this formula into a sum of binomial coefficients, the formula for the ordered Bell numbers may be expanded out into a double summation. The ordered Bell numbers may also be given by an infinite series:
formula_38
Another summation formula expresses the ordered Bell numbers in terms of the Eulerian numbers formula_39, which count the permutations of formula_1 items in which formula_18 pairs of consecutive items are in increasing order:
formula_42
where formula_43 is the formula_1th Eulerian polynomial. One way to explain this summation formula involves a mapping from weak orderings on the numbers from 1 to formula_1 to permutations, obtained by sorting each tied set into numerical order. Under this mapping, each permutation with formula_18 consecutive increasing pairs comes from formula_47 weak orderings, distinguished from each other by the subset of the consecutive increasing pairs that are tied in the weak ordering.
Generating function and approximation.
As with many other integer sequences, reinterpreting the sequence as the coefficients of a power series and working with the function that results from summing this series can provide useful information about the sequence. 
The fast growth of the ordered Bell numbers causes their ordinary generating function to diverge; instead the exponential generating function is used. For the ordered Bell numbers, it is:
formula_48
Here, the left hand side is just the definition of the exponential generating function and the right hand side is the function obtained from this summation.
The form of this function corresponds to the fact that the ordered Bell numbers are the numbers in the first column of the infinite matrix formula_49. Here formula_50 is the identity matrix and formula_51 is an infinite matrix form of Pascal's triangle. Each row of formula_51 starts with the numbers in the same row of Pascal's triangle, and then continues with an infinite repeating sequence of zeros.
Based on a contour integration of this generating function, the ordered Bell numbers can be expressed by the infinite sum
formula_53
Here, formula_54 stands for the natural logarithm. This leads to an approximation for the ordered Bell numbers, obtained by using only the term for formula_33 in this sum and discarding the remaining terms:
formula_56
where formula_57. Thus, the ordered Bell numbers are larger than the factorials by an exponential factor. Here, as in Stirling's approximation to the factorial, the formula_58 indicates asymptotic equivalence. That is, the ratio between the ordered Bell numbers and their approximation tends to one in the limit as formula_1 grows arbitrarily large. As expressed in little o notation, the relative error is formula_60, and the formula_61 error term decays exponentially as formula_1 grows.
Comparing the approximations for formula_63 and formula_3 shows that
formula_65
For example, taking formula_66 gives the approximation formula_67 to formula_68.
This sequence of approximations, and this example from it, were calculated by Ramanujan, using a general method for solving equations numerically (here, the equation formula_69).
Recurrence and modular periodicity.
As well as the formulae above, the ordered Bell numbers may be calculated by the recurrence relation
The intuitive meaning of this formula is that a weak ordering on formula_1 items may be broken down into a choice of some nonempty set of formula_12 items that go into the first equivalence class of the ordering, together with a smaller weak ordering on the remaining formula_73 items. There are formula_74 choices of the first set, and formula_75 choices of the weak ordering on the rest of the elements. Multiplying these two factors, and then summing over the choices of how many elements to include in the first set, gives the number of weak orderings, formula_3. As a base case for the recurrence, formula_77 (there is one weak ordering on zero items). Based on this recurrence, these numbers can be shown to obey certain periodic patterns in modular arithmetic: for sufficiently large formula_1,
Many more modular identities are known, including identities modulo any prime power. Peter Bala has conjectured that this sequence is eventually periodic (after a finite number of terms) modulo each positive integer formula_18, with a period that divides Euler's totient function of formula_18, the number of residues mod formula_18 that are relatively prime to formula_18.
Applications.
Combinatorial enumeration.
As has already been mentioned, the ordered Bell numbers count weak orderings, permutohedron faces, Cayley trees, Cayley permutations, and equivalent formulae in Fubini's theorem. Weak orderings in turn have many other applications. For instance, in horse racing, photo finishes have eliminated most but not all ties, called in this context dead heats, and the outcome of a race that may contain ties (including all the horses, not just the first three finishers) may be described using a weak ordering. For this reason, the ordered Bell numbers count the possible number of outcomes of a horse race. In contrast, when items are ordered or ranked in a way that does not allow ties (such as occurs with the ordering of cards in a deck of cards, or batting orders among baseball players), the number of orderings for formula_1 items is a factorial number formula_84, which is significantly smaller than the corresponding ordered Bell number.
Problems in many areas can be formulated using weak orderings, with solutions counted using ordered Bell numbers. consider combination locks with a numeric keypad, in which several keys may be pressed simultaneously and a combination consists of a sequence of keypresses that includes each key exactly once. As they show, the number of different combinations in such a system is given by the ordered Bell numbers. In "seru", a Japanese technique for balancing assembly lines, cross-trained workers are allocated to groups of workers at different stages of a production line. The number of alternative assignments for a given number of workers, taking into account the choices of how many stages to use and how to assign workers to each stage, is an ordered Bell number. As another example, in the computer simulation of origami, the ordered Bell numbers give the number of orderings in which the creases of a crease pattern can be folded, allowing sets of creases to be folded simultaneously.
In number theory, an ordered multiplicative partition of a positive integer is a representation of the number as a product of one or more of its divisors. For instance, 30 has 13 multiplicative partitions, as a product of one divisor (30 itself), two divisors (for instance ), or three divisors (, etc.). An integer is squarefree when it is a product of distinct prime numbers; 30 is squarefree, but 20 is not, because its prime factorization repeats the prime 2. For squarefree numbers with formula_1 prime factors, an ordered multiplicative partition can be described by a weak ordering on its prime factors, describing which prime appears in which term of the partition. Thus, the number of ordered multiplicative partitions is given by formula_3. On the other hand, for a prime power with exponent formula_1, an ordered multiplicative partition is a product of powers of the same prime number, with exponents summing to formula_1, and this ordered sum of exponents is a composition of formula_1. Thus, in this case, there are formula_9 ordered multiplicative partitions. Numbers that are neither squarefree nor prime powers have a number of ordered multiplicative partitions that (as a function of the number of prime factors) is between these two extreme cases.
A parking function, in mathematics, is a finite sequence of positive integers with the property that, for every formula_12 up to the sequence length, the sequence contains at least formula_12 values that are at most formula_12. A sequence of this type, of length formula_1, describes the following process: a sequence of formula_1 cars arrives on a street with formula_1 parking spots. Each car has a preferred parking spot, given by its value in the sequence. When a car arrives on the street, it parks in its preferred spot, or, if that is full, in the next available spot. A sequence of preferences forms a parking function if and only if each car can find a parking spot on or after its preferred spot. The number of parking functions of length formula_1 is exactly formula_98. For a restricted class of parking functions, in which each car parks either on its preferred spot or on the next spot, the number of parking functions is given by the ordered Bell numbers. Each restricted parking function corresponds to a weak ordering in which the cars that get their preferred spot are ordered by these spots, and each remaining car is tied with the car in its preferred spot. The permutations, counted by the factorials, are parking functions for which each car parks on its preferred spot. This application also provides a combinatorial proof for upper and lower bounds on the ordered Bell numbers of a simple form,
formula_99
The ordered Bell number formula_3 counts the number of faces in the Coxeter complex associated with a Coxeter group of type formula_101. Here, a Coxeter group can be thought of as a finite system of reflection symmetries, closed under repeated reflections, whose mirrors partition a Euclidean space into the cells of the Coxeter complex. For instance, formula_102 corresponds to formula_103, the system of reflections of the Euclidean plane across three lines that meet at the origin at formula_104 angles. The complex formed by these three lines has 13 faces: the origin, six rays from the origin, and six regions between pairs of rays.
 uses the ordered Bell numbers to analyze -ary relations, mathematical statements that might be true of some choices of the formula_1 arguments to the relation and false for others. He defines the "complexity" of a relation to mean the number of other relations one can derive from the given one by permuting and repeating its arguments. For instance, for formula_106, a relation on two arguments formula_107 and formula_108 might take the form formula_109. By Kemeny's analysis, it has formula_110 derived relations. These are the given relation formula_109, the converse relation formula_112 obtained by swapping the arguments, and the unary relation formula_113 obtained by repeating an argument. (Repeating the other argument produces the same relation.)
 apply these numbers to optimality theory in linguistics. In this theory, grammars for natural languages are constructed by ranking certain constraints, and (in a phenomenon called factorial typology) the number of different grammars that can be formed in this way is limited to the number of permutations of the constraints. A paper reviewed by Ellison and Klein suggested an extension of this linguistic model in which ties between constraints are allowed, so that the ranking of constraints becomes a weak order rather than a total order. As they point out, the much larger magnitude of the ordered Bell numbers, relative to the corresponding factorials, allows this theory to generate a much richer set of grammars.
Other.
If a fair coin (with equal probability of heads or tails) is flipped repeatedly until the first time the result is heads, the number of tails follows a geometric distribution. The moments of this distribution are the ordered Bell numbers.
Although the ordinary generating function of the ordered Bell numbers fails to converge, it describes a power series that (evaluated at formula_114 and then multiplied by formula_115) provides an asymptotic expansion for the resistance distance of opposite vertices of an formula_1-dimensional hypercube graph. Truncating this series to a bounded number of terms and then applying the result for unbounded values of formula_1 approximates the resistance to arbitrarily high order.
In the algebra of noncommutative rings, an analogous construction to the (commutative) quasisymmetric functions produces a graded algebra WQSym whose dimensions in each grade are given by the ordered Bell numbers.
In spam filtering, the problem of assigning weights to sequences of words with the property that the weight of any sequence exceeds the sum of weights of all its subsequences can be solved by using weight formula_118 for a sequence of formula_1 words, where formula_118 is obtained from the recurrence equation
formula_121
with base case formula_122. This recurrence differs from the one given earlier for the ordered Bell numbers, in two respects: omitting the formula_123 term from the sum (because only nonempty sequences are considered), and adding one separately from the sum (to make the result exceed, rather than equalling, the sum). These differences have offsetting effects, and the resulting weights are the ordered Bell numbers.

Modern furniture

Modern furniture refers to furniture produced from the late 19th century through the present that is influenced by modernism. Post-World War II ideals of cutting excess, commodification, and practicality of materials in design heavily influenced the aesthetic of the furniture. It was a tremendous departure from all furniture design that had gone before it. There was an opposition to the decorative arts, which included Art Nouveau, Neoclassical, and Victorian styles. Dark or gilded carved wood and richly patterned fabrics gave way to the glittering simplicity and geometry of polished metal. The forms of furniture evolved from visually heavy to visually light. This shift from decorative to minimalist principles of design can be attributed to the introduction of new technology, changes in philosophy, and the influences of the principles of architecture. As Philip Johnson, the founder of the Department of Architecture and Design at the Museum of Modern Art articulates:
"Today industrial design is functionally motivated and follows the same principles as modern architecture: machine-like simplicity, smoothness of surface, avoidance of ornament ... It is perhaps the most fundamental contrast between the two periods of design that in 1900 the Decorative Arts possessed ..."
With the machine aesthetic, modern furniture easily came to promote factory modules, which emphasized the time-managing, efficient ideals of the period. Modernist design was able to strip down decorative elements and focus on the design of the object in order to save time, money, material, and labour. The goal of modern design was to capture timeless beauty in spare precision.
Philosophy.
Prior to the modernist design movement, there was an emphasis on furniture as an ornament. The length of time a piece took to create was often a measure of its value and desirability. The origins of modernist design can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution and the birth of mechanized production. With new resources and advancements, a new philosophy emerged, one that shifted the emphasis of objects being created for decorative purposes to being designs that promote functionality, accessibility, and production.
The idea of accessible, mass-produced design that is affordable to anyone was not only applied to industrial mechanics, but also to the aesthetics of architecture and furniture. This philosophy of practicality came to be called Functionalism. It became a popular "catchword" and played a large role in theories of modern design. Functionalism rejected the imitation of stylistic and historical forms and sought an establishment of functionality in a piece. Functionalist designers would consider the interaction of the design with its user and how many of the features, such as shape, colour, and size, would conform to the human posture. Western design generally, whether architectural or design of furniture, had for millennia sought to convey an idea of lineage, a connection with tradition and history.
However, the modern movement sought newness, originality, technical innovation, and ultimately the message that it conveyed spoke of the present and the future, rather than of what had gone before it.
Influential groups.
The modernist design seems to have evolved out of a combination of influences: technically innovative materials and new manufacturing methods. Following the Second Industrial Revolution, new philosophies and artists emerged from the De Stijl movement in the Netherlands, the Deutscher Werkbund and the Bauhaus school, both located in Germany.
De Stijl.
The De Stijl (The Style) movement, was founded in 1917 by Theo Van Doesburg in Amsterdam. The movement was based on the principles of promoting abstraction and universality by reducing excessive elements down to the essentials of form and colour. Dutch design generally has shown a preference for simple materials and construction, but De Stijl artists, architects, and designers strove to combine these elements to create a new visual culture. Characteristics of furniture from this movement include simplified geometry of vertical and horizontal compositions and pure primary colours and black and white. It was the rejection of the decorative excesses from Art Nouveau and promoted logicality through construction and function. Influential artists from this movement include Gerrit Rietveld, Piet Mondrian, and Mies van der Rohe, who continued to evolve the ideas of modernist design.
Deutscher Werkbund.
Founded in 1907 in Munich, Germany, the Deutscher Werkbund was an organization of artists, designers, and manufacturers that pushed to create a cultural utopia achieved through a design and new ideas in the early twentieth century. They shared the Modern thought of "form follows function" as well as the "ethnically pure" design principles such as quality, material honestly, functionality, and sustainability. The DWB played a key role in advocating these to other German artists and designers, which inspired the development of many Modern design institutions. Among the most notable architects and designers from the DWB are: Hermann Muthesius, Peter Behrens, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.
The Bauhaus School.
The Bauhaus school, founded in 1919 in Weimar, Germany, by architect Walter Gropius, was an art school that combined all aspects of art. It eventually was forced to move to Dessau, Germany, in 1925 due to political tensions, then Berlin, in 1932 until the doors of the school were closed from the pressure of the Nazi regime. With the change of location came a change of direction in the institution. The Bauhaus adopted an emphasis on production in Dessau, but maintained its intellectual concerns in design. Throughout the years, the goal of the institution was to combine intellectual, practical, commercial, and aesthetic concerns through art and technology. The Bauhaus promoted the unity of all areas of art and design: from typography to tableware, clothing, performance, furniture, art, and architecture. Prominent artists and designers from the Bauhaus include: Marcel Breuer, Marianne Brandt, Hannes Meyer (who was Gropius's successor, only to be replaced by Mies van der Rohe).
African and Asian culture.
An aesthetic preference for the baroque and the complex was challenged not only by new materials and the courage and creativity of a few Europeans, but also by the growing access to African and Asian design. In particular the influence of Japanese design is legend: in the last years of the 19th century the Edo period in Japan, Japanese isolationist policy began to soften, and trade with the west began in earnest. The artifacts that emerged were striking in their simplicity, their use of solid planes of color without ornament, and contrasting use of pattern. A tremendous fashion for all things Japanese – Japonism – swept Europe. Some say that the western Art Nouveau movement emerged from this influence directly. Designers such as Charles Rennie MacIntosh and Eileen Gray are known for both their modern and Art Deco work, and they and others like Frank Lloyd Wright are notable for a certain elegant blending of the two styles.
Materials.
The use of new materials, such as steel in its many forms; glass, used by Walter Gropius; molded plywood, such as that used by Charles and Ray Eames; and of course plastics, were formative in the creation of these new designs. They would have been considered pioneering, even shocking in contrast to what came before. This interest in new and innovative materials and methods – produced a certain blending of the disciplines of technology and art. And this became a working philosophy among the members of the Deutscher Werkbund. The Werkbund was a government-sponsored organization to promote German art and design around the world. Many of those involved with it including Mies van der Rohe, Lilly Reich and others, were later involved in the Bauhaus School, and so it is not surprising perhaps that the Bauhaus School took on the mantle of this philosophy. They evolved a particular interest in using these new materials in such a way that they might be mass-produced and therefore make good design more accessible to the masses.
Iconic examples of modern furniture.
Gerrit Rietveld's Red-Blue Armchair.
The first versions of Gerrit Rietveld's Red-Blue Armchair were created around 1917. However, they were originally stained black – the colour was eventually added to give characteristics of De Stijl in 1923. Rietveld's intent was to design a piece of furniture that could be cheaply mass-produced. He uses standard beechwood laths and pine planks that intersect and are fixed by wooden pegs. The functions of construction, the seat, the back and armrests are explicitly separated from one another visually. In fact, Rietveld saw the chair as the skeleton of an overstuffed armchair with all the excessive components removed.
Marcel Breuer's Wassily Chair.
This modernist creation enjoyed enduring fame in the post-war period, seeing reproduction numbers upwards of four digits across two continents. The Wassily Chair, also known as the Model B3 chair, was designed by Marcel Breuer in 1925–26 while he was the head of the cabinet-making workshop at the Bauhaus, in Dessau, Germany.
This piece is particularly influential because it introduces a simple, yet elegant and light-weight industrial material to be used in structures within the domestic space: chrome plated tubular steel. The design of the chair is revolutionary with its use of symmetrical, geometric planes framed by the tubular steel. Breuer uses simple straps on canvas for the seat, back and armrests to support the seated figure. The concept of the use of tubular steel, a never before seen the material in the domestic space was inspired by the handles of Breuer's bicycle. He reasoned that if such a material was light-weight yet strong enough to support the body in motion, it is likely to be able to support the body at rest. He applies uncomplicated essentials (the canvas strips) to create a functional aesthetic as well. Nonetheless, the Model B3 Chair (dubbed the Wassily Chair by the manufacturing company, Gavina after learning of the anecdote involving the painter Wassily Kandinsky) inspired many artists and designers to include the use of chrome plated steel, including Le Corbusier, who includes it as a structure for his Chaise Longue. 
Le Corbusier LC4 Chaise Longue.
Inspired by Marcel Breuer's use of chrome plated tubular steel in his Wassily Chair, in 1928, Le Corbusier creates a sleek steel support for the back and seat of his Chaise Longue. The Chaise Longue features a movable seat section and an adjustable headrest, which is an early example of ergonomic design. With the tubular steel frames and leather or skin upholstery, the sleek Chaise Longue was initially manufactured for private French house commissions including the Villa Savoye, Poissy (1929–31) and the Ville-d'Avray. This piece epitomizes the mass production of the industrial age through the use of materials and structure. However, unlike the Wassily Chair, the complex design made reproduction expensive.
Le Corbusier LC2 Sofa.
The Le Corbusier LC2 are armchairs and sofas with the chrome plated tubular steel frame supporting loose cushions placed on elasticated straps. The LC2 represented the new and modern conception of designer furniture in the Le Corbusier minimalism – style with the steel cage giving an element of industrial. The first results of the collaboration between Le Corbusier and Perriand were three pieces of furniture made with chrome-plated tubular steel frames.

Designed in 1927 as a bedside table for the guest room in E-1027, the home Eileen Gray designed for herself (and Jean Badovici) in Cap Martin, France, the asymmetry of this piece is characteristic of her "non-conformist" design style in her architectural projects and furniture. Eileen Gray had always been influenced by Japanese lacquer and furniture, and the minimalist lines and elegant structure found normally in traditional Japanese works are found in most of Gray's objects. The name, E-1027, can be seen in a somewhat romantic reading: The "E" stands for "Eileen" and the numbers, corresponding to their sequence in the alphabet, stand for "J", "B", and "G". The second and tenth letter allude to her friend and mentor, Jean Badovici.Gray's emphasis on functionalist design is apparent in her use of tubular steel and the concentric symmetry of the surface. Notably, this piece also has specific utility, as it can be adjusted such that one can eat breakfast in bed on it. Gray's sister had requested such accommodation during her visits to E-1027.
Mies van der Rohe Barcelona chair.
The Barcelona chair has come to represent the Bauhaus design movement. Many consider it to be functional art, rather than just furniture. Designed by Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich in 1929 for the German Pavilion at the international design fair, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, it is said to have been inspired by both the folding chairs of the Pharaohs, and the X-shaped footstools of the Romans, and dedicated to the Spanish royal families. Like other designers following Breuer's example, he incorporates the use of chrome-plated flat steel bars to create a single S-shaped curve. The front legs cross the 'S' curve of the bars forming the seat and the back legs. It creates a sleek and intentionally simple aesthetic to the piece.
Robin Day Polyprop chair.
In 1963 Robin Day designed the "Polyprop" chair for the British furniture design house Hille. Made of moulded polypropylene, the "Polyprop" sold in millions and became the world's best-selling chair. Today it is regarded as a modern design classic, and has been celebrated by Royal Mail with a commemorative postage stamp.
Noguchi coffee table.
Noguchi table was designed by Isamu Noguchi (1904–1988), a sculptor, draftsman, potter, architect, landscape architect, product, furniture and stage designer. Half American, half Japanese, he is famous for his organic modern forms. He often stated, "Everything is sculpture, any materials, any idea without hindrance born into space, I consider sculpture." The Noguchi table – has become famous for its unique and unmistakable simplicity. It is refined and at the same time natural, it is one of the most sought-after pieces associated with the modern classic furniture movement.
Chronology.
Chronologically the design movement that produced modern furniture design, began earlier than one might imagine. Many of its most recognizable personalities were born of the 19th or the very beginning of the 20th centuries.
They were teaching and studying in Germany and elsewhere in the 1920s and 30s. At among other places the Bauhaus school of art and architecture. The furniture that was produced during this era is today known as "Modern Classic Furniture" or "Mid Century Modern".
Both the Bauhaus School and the Deutscher Werkbund had as their specific creative emphasis the blending of technology, new materials and art.
Transitional furniture.
Obviously not all furniture produced since this time is modern, for there is still a tremendous amount of traditional design being reproduced for today's market and then, of course, there is also an entire breed of design which sits between the two, and is referred to as transitional design. Neither entirely modern or traditional, it seeks to blend elements of multiple styles. It often includes both modern and traditional as well as making visual reference to classical Greek form and/or other non-western styles (for example Tribal African pattern, Asian scroll work etc.).
Modern to contemporary.
Today contemporary furniture designers and manufacturers continue to evolve the design. Still seeking new materials, with which to produce unique forms, still employing simplicity and lightness of form, in preference to a heavy ornament. And most of all they are still endeavouring to step beyond what has gone before to create entirely new visual experiences for us.
The designs that prompted this paradigm shift were produced in the middle of the 20th century, most of them well before 1960. And yet they are still regarded internationally as symbols of the modern age, the present and perhaps even the future. Modern Classic Furniture became an icon of elegance and sophistication.

Spiritual formation

Spiritual formation may refer either to the process and practices by which a person may progress in one's spiritual or religious life or to a movement in Protestant Christianity that emphasizes these processes and practices. The processes may include, but are not limited to,
There are numerous definitions of spiritual formation and no definitive depiction due to the breadth of the concept and the numerous perspectives from which religious persons may approach it. From a Christian standpoint, some state that it is identical with sanctification as understood as a progressive and gradual process of maturation. It is often referred to as "being conformed to the image of Christ," being made holy, or the formation of virtue and character. In "Care of Mind, Care of Spirit," psychiatrist Gerald G. May offers, “Spiritual formation is a rather general term referring to all attempts, means, instruction, and disciplines intended towards deepening of faith and furtherance of spiritual growth. It includes educational endeavors as well as the more intimate and in-depth process of joy and enthusiasm spiritual direction.”
Christianity.
Christian spiritual formation is distinct from other religious perspectives due to the centrality of Jesus as the model of the process and ultimate goal of formation as well as the activity of the Holy Spirit in the believer to develop them toward maturity. Additionally, in the contemporary Christian tradition, many have emphasized the growth of multiple aspects of the human person, distinguishing between faculties such as the intellectual, emotional, and spiritual, all of which must be developed in tandem for the maturity of the whole person.
Disciplines.
Because the popular understanding of Protestant spiritual formation in the current era arose around a discussion of spiritual disciplines, as noted below, those disciplines have played a significant role in its conceptualization and practice. Such disciplines may be understood as means of exercising and strengthening one's religious and spiritual capacities, a means of accessing a spiritual reality directly, or a manner of making oneself available to the activity of God.
Spiritual disciplines, as a strategy towards spiritual formation, have risen and fallen in popularity over the centuries. Christianity asserts two things: first, transformation of the heart is a work only God can accomplish, and second, we are saved not by our works or efforts, but by God's grace, that is, His unmerited favor; the church has often been tempted to marginalize the usefulness of these disciplines so as not be confused with preaching "justification by works".
However other scholars respond by saying that it is not salvation that is at stake, but rather the need to develop people of genuine Christ-like character to live in the world and confront its values.
Quaker theologian Richard Foster in his book, "Celebration of Discipline", includes several internal, external, and corporate disciplines one should engage in through his or her Christian life. These include the following:
Related specifically to the practices of solitude, stillness and silence, Dallas Willard stated that practices 'that look more "Catholic," like solitude, silence, and so on, we're not so good with those. And usually I find they deal with the areas where our deepest problem lies.
So we have to find the ways of taking our body into solitude and silence, into service, as well as into worship, into prayer, as well as into study' 
History of the Protestant Movement.
Spiritual formation in general has been integral to most religions, including Christianity. The religious ideal typically presupposes that one be changed in some manner through interaction with spiritual realities. Therefore, to trace a historical origin of spiritual formation is to examine the history of religion in general.
However, the history of spiritual formation as a specific movement within 20th century Protestantism is possible. James Houston traces the history of the movement to post-Vatican II reformers within the Roman Catholic church, who sought to find ways to educate and train new priests in a manner that was appropriate to Vatican II ideals. This formative perspective began to spread into and was adopted by the Association of Theological Schools, and as an increasing number of evangelical schools began joining them in the 1970s and 1980s, the ideals spread throughout the academic and theological strata of Christianity, particularly in the United States. While initially aimed at academic and pastoral leadership, Houston notes that the Protestant ideal of the priesthood of all believers pushed churches to expand this formative ideal to all individuals.
On a popular level, the formation movement emerged, in part, with the publication of Richard Foster's "Celebration of Discipline" in 1978, which introduced and popularized a set of spiritual disciplines as historical practices beyond Bible study, prayer, and church attendance that may lead to religious maturity and spiritual growth.
Controversy.
Validity of Ideals.
While some Christians understand spiritual formation to be an integral part of their religion, others perceive it as a diluting of the faith or an attempt by competing religious ideals to infiltrate Christian doctrine and lead adherents astray. Some individuals and organizations, such as Lighthouse Trails Research, interpret spiritual formation as a front for non-Christian mysticism or Roman Catholic influence to enter the Protestant church, which they see as damaging religious doctrine and leading Christians to engage in dangerous practices or leave the faith entirely.
Short-Term Movement.
Because spiritual formation has been used, in recent decades, to describe a loose but semi-coherent set of practices and ideals within American Protestantism, many have accused it of merely being a "fad". Such persons dismiss it because of this trendiness, but others have argued that to relegate it only to a small sub-group within the church is to neglect its necessity to Christian practice.

War Trash

War Trash is a novel by the Chinese author Ha Jin, who has long lived in the United States and who writes in English. It takes the form of a memoir written by the fictional character Yu Yuan, a man who eventually becomes a soldier in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and who is sent to Korea to fight on the Communist side in the Korean War. The majority of the "memoir" is devoted to describing this experience, especially after Yu Yuan is captured by United Nations forces and imprisoned as a POW. The novel captured the PEN/Faulkner Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.
Plot summary.
Yu Yuan was originally a cadet at Huangpu Military Academy, an important part of the Kuomintang military system. However, when the Communists gained the upper hand in China, the academy went over to their side, and Yu was made a part of the PLA. He is eventually sent to Korea as a lower-ranking officer in the 180th Division. Since he knew some English, he is made part of his unit's staff as a possible translator. He left behind his mother and his fiancee, a girl named Tao Julan.
Yu Yuan's unit eventually crosses into Korea and engages the South Korean and UN forces there. After the unit is encircled and destroyed, Yu Yuan is injured and is captured. He spends some time in a hospital, where the ministrations of the medical staff impress him with the humane nature of the medical profession.
Subsequently, Yu Yuan is put in a prisoner of war camp. A major political fault line ran through the Communist prisoners, both historically and in the novel. On one side are those who are "loyal" and wish to be repatriated to the Communist side, either North Korean or Chinese; these are called "pro-Communists". On the other side are those who wish to be released to the "Free World", whether that be South Korea or the remaining Chinese Kuomintang bastion of Taiwan. This group is called "pro-Nationalists". Violence often flares between these two groups, and the chief tension in the book is the narrator's attempts to navigate this political minefield.
Prisoner with the Nationalists.
After his capture, Yu is registered as a POW in the city of Pusan. He assumes a false identity to hide his rank as a low-level officer. All captured officers give their names and try to mix in with enlisted men so that they will not be subject to questioning and torture by the captors. He is then taken to the island of Geoje, which was cleared of most civilians to house POWs captured by the South Korean military.
Yu initially finds himself in the pro-Nationalist camp, somewhat against his will. This is not because he is politically passionate, but because his main goal is to return home to his mother and fiancee. Going to Taiwan would politically taint him in communist China and make such a return impossible. His association with Huangpu lends him some breathing room, but when he states his intention to return to mainland China, he is kidnapped by the Nationalists and tattooed with the words "FUCK COMMUNISM" in English.
A decision is made by the administrators of the camp to conduct a "screening" to divide the Nationalists and Communists in the camp and hopefully reduce violence. This period before the screening is an intense time for the camp, as the leadership of both sides wants to convince the prisoners to choose the correct side, thus scoring a propaganda victory. Yu witnesses horrendous torture and coercion committed by pro-Nationalist officers, but motivated by a longing for home, he chooses the Communist side.
Working for the Communists.
Now in a Communist camp, Yu is suspected for his Huangpu ties and his stint with the Nationalists. However, his skills in English are useful and he eventually gains the trust of his superiors. The coordination of the camp is much better than before, and the prisoners organize themselves for resistance. However, they cannot compete with the camp of the North Koreans, who due to their greater knowledge of the area and better underground networks, can carry out stunning logistical feats and are in communication with their capital Pyongyang.
Eventually, the North Koreans organize an attempt to kidnap Gen. Bell, the commandant of all the POW camps. (This is a reference to the historical attempt to capture the American General Francis T. Dodd). They enlist the participation of the Chinese camp through a meeting of emissaries. As a mark of Yu's trustworthiness, Commissar Pei, the leader of the Chinese pro-Communist camp, sends Yu as his representative. The Chinese camp gathers information and passes it to the North Korean camp, which subsequently lures Bell in for negotiations then kidnaps him, a propaganda coup for the Communists.
Soon, the prisoners are sent to better organized camps on Cheju Island. The facilities are better, but the methods of prisoner control are also enhanced, making it harder to resist. Commissar Pei, for instance, is separated from the men. Also, the prisoners begin to feel very isolated from their country, and worry that they will be treated with suspicion after returning to China, as it can be considered treason to be captured rather than fight to the death. However, with ingenious methods of communication developed, Pei sends orders to raise homemade Chinese communist flags on national day, a provocation which creates a confrontation and raises morale, though lives are lost in the ensuing battle.
To the Nationalists, and back again.
At some point a small group of pro-Communist officers—including Commissar Pei's right-hand man, Party member Chang Ming—is ordered to Korea to "re-register". Fearing that this will permanently strip him of his English-speaking lieutenant, Pei orders Yu Yuan to assume Ming's identity and go in his place. Fuming at being sacrificed like a pawn for a man no different from him except for Party membership, Yuan obeys and is sent to Korea. It turns out that "re-registering" is not something sinister, but rather bureaucratic processing. However, the subterfuge of "Ming" is discovered and in the confusion he declares his dislike of the Communists. As a result, he is now sent to the Nationalist camp back of Koje Island.
Back with the Nationalists again, Yuan is subject to another round of suspicion for siding with the Communists earlier. He weathers this (due in part to his tattoo, which he has kept after having it cleared with the Communists). The officers on the Nationalist side hope that his credentials will elevate him once they get to Taiwan, and in this position he might be able to help them. During this time, the armistice is signed by the UN and North Koreans, and the prisoners begin to look forward, with hope and anxiety, towards their repatriation.
Required yet again to declare his allegiance, Yu Yuan, as always, is in a delicate situation. His time on the Communist side means he will always be politically damaged goods in Taiwan, forever handicapped. On the other hand, unless Pei and Ming are still alive and in the good graces of the Party—and therefore able to explain that the Party ordered him to be re-registered—his "defection" to the Nationalists (as well as the lingering taint of being a prisoner in the first place) could be politically devastating if he returns home. He hears that there may be a third option, to emigrate to a neutral country. Quietly, he makes this his plan.
However, when Yu Yuan first enters the tent where declarations must be made, he finds that one of the Communist Chinese observers is a friend of his who instantly recognizes him! No longer anonymous, he realizes that if he chooses a third country, his disloyal choice will be traced to his family and they will suffer. Encouraged by his friend about the treatment prisoners receive in China, he makes the decision to return home on the spot.
Bittersweet return to China.
Yu's homecoming is not what he had hoped for in the more than two years he has been away. His superiors stand up for him, witnessing to the pro-Communist acts he had carried out. But as party members, they are severely tainted (party members swore an oath to fight to the death, and thus their capture is even more dishonorable) and their evidence is worthless. Yu finds out that his mother has died, and Julan has deserted him as a disgrace. Forever marked by his disloyalty, he is unable to use his college education well, and quietly becomes a teacher.
In the epilogue-like final chapter, Yu describes his marriage and children. He is not so tainted that he cannot get his offspring into college, and eventually his son goes to the United States for education. Yu gets his tattoo changed to FUCK...U...S by erasing some of the letters of COMMUNISM. An old man, he learns of the ruin of his communist superiors and the success of some of his Nationalist acquaintances in Taiwan. Eventually, he visits his son in America, giving opportunity for one last comical difficulty with his tattoo, again highly inappropriate. It is here that he finds the time to write the memoir, dedicated to his American grandchildren, which the reader has been enjoying.

Sano (company)

Sano () is a detergent products manufacturer in Israel founded in 1961 by Bruno Landesberg. The company produces toiletries and hygiene products, disposable diapers, incontinence products for adults, household cleaning products, laundry detergents, pesticides and insect repellents, cosmetics and various paper products. Sano is headquartered in Hod Hasharon with subsidiary plants in Netanya, Kibbutz Snir, Emek Hefer and Eastern Europe.
The Latin word "sano" means "to heal".
History.
In 1952, Bruno Landesberg immigrated from Romania and began working in the accounting department at Rafael. After a few years, he began working in sales at the Kadima Chemicals Corporation, a cleaning products manufacturer. In 1959, Landesberg took advantage of a takeover of 'Kadima' to purchase the distribution line and founded the Southern Marketing Company. The first year, the company distributed products of Vitco Fertilizers. A year later, Landesberg decided to begin independent production and started pioneering a brand that would include all of his products under one name. The first Sano product was toilet bowl scouring powder.
After completing Economics and Commerce studies at Harvard University, Landesberg returned to Israel and opened a factory in Bat Yam. At the time, Sano had only four employees, one machine and three products. In 1963, Sano began selling 3M Scotch-Brite, a move that was profitable. In 1969, the company began producing mosquito repellant, cockroach control, and an air freshener named 'Sano Fresh'. In 1972, the company moved the factory to Hod Hasharon where it has since expanded and operates its main distribution center and factories.
In 1982, Sano made its first initial public offering on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Two years later, Sano opened a new factory in Bnei Brak and started manufacturing disposable diapers named 'Litufim'. In the 1990s, the company began its overseas expansion by exporting to Europe and entering into a partnership to manufacture detergents in China. In 1996, Sano stopped marketing Vitco products and came out with a new line of its own.
In 2017, Sano had close to 2,000 employees and marketed over 2,000 products. Sano exports to Romania, Ukraine, Hungary, Moldova, the UK, and many other countries.

Sri Bhashya

The Sri Bhashya () is the most famous work of the Hindu philosopher Ramanuja (1017–1137). It is his commentary on Badarayana's Vedanta/Brahma Sutra. 
Description.
In his commentary, Ramanuja presents the fundamental philosophical principles of Vishishtadvaita based on his interpretation of the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita and other Smriti texts, the previous acharyas, and the Vedanta-sutra itself. This is done by way of refuting Shankara's Advaita Vedanta and in particular his theory of maya. In this work, he describes the three categories of reality (tattvas): God, soul, and matter, which have been used by the later Vaishnava theologians such as Madhva. He explains the relationship between the body and the soul. The principles of bhakti as a means to liberation (moksha) were also developed. Ramanuja wrote the Vedanta-Dipa and Vedanta-Sara to aid in the overall understanding of the Sri Bhashya.
Purvapaksha.
In Sri Bhashya 1.1.1, Ramanuja states and then refutes the Advaitic position that pure, undifferentiated consciousness, or Brahman, is the sole reality, equated with Being itself. In this view, the apparent plurality of the world is attributed to avidya (ignorance), a beginningless and inexplicable force that conceals Brahman's true nature and creates the illusion of distinction. Everything apart from Brahman, including acts of knowledge and objects, is deemed false and conceptual constructs. Ramanuja criticizes this view for invalidating ordinary experience.

Gudrød Bjørnsson was, in late tradition, the son of Bjørn Farmann, the king of Vestfold, and a grandson of Harald Fairhair. These traditions make Gudrød the father of Harald Grenske, and the paternal grandfather of Saint Olaf, but modern scholars have suggested this pedigree was fabricated to link Saint Olaf to Harald Fairhair.
After Gudrød's father had been killed by Eric Bloodaxe, he lived with his uncle Olaf Haraldsson Geirstadalf, the king of Vingulmark. Olaf rebelled against Bloodaxe, but was killed in battle, and so Gudrød had to escape to Oppland.
When Haakon the Good became king, Gudrød was given Vestfold, his father's kingdom, as a fief.
Gudrød was slain in the vicinity of Tønsberg, by Harald Greyhide, who feared a rebellion from his subordinate kings.

Laser Mégajoule

Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) is a large laser-based inertial confinement fusion (ICF) research device near Bordeaux, France, built by the French nuclear science directorate, Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique (CEA).
Laser Mégajoule plans to deliver over 1 MJ of laser energy to its targets, compressing them to about 100 times the density of lead. It is about half as energetic as its US counterpart, the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Laser Mégajoule is the largest ICF experiment outside the US.
Laser Mégajoule's primary task will be refining fusion calculations for France's own nuclear weapons. A portion of the system's time is set aside for materials science experiments.
Construction of the LMJ took 15 years and cost 3 billion euros. It was declared operational on 23 October 2014, when it ran its first set of nuclear-weapon-related experiments.
Description.
Laser Mégajoule uses a series of 22 laser "beamlines". They are arranged into four separate "halls", two each side-by-side on either side of the experimental area in the center. Two of the halls have five lines, the other two have six.
Lasing starts in four optoelectronic lasers, one for each hall. The laser light from these sources is amplified in a series of 120 preamplifier modules (PAM), exiting the PAMs as a square beam about . The system is arranged so that beams from the PAMs are sent into the amplifiers in groups of eight, arranged as two groups of four beams, a "quad", one quad above the other. This allows each amplifier line to produce eight separate beams. In contrast, NIF uses individual amplifiers for each of its 192 beams.
Each beamline contains two main glass amplifiers, which are optically pumped using xenon flashlamps. In order to extract more power from the amplifiers, which are not particularly efficient in transmitting power to the beam, the laser pulse is sent through the amplifiers twice by an optical switch in front of a mirror.
When the amplification is complete, the beams travel towards the "line end", closest to the target chamber in the center of the building. Each beam is reflected off a series of six mirrors to rearrange them from their parallel orientation in the beamlines to be arranged around the target chamber. The beams then travel through an optical frequency multiplier to boost the frequency into the ultraviolet. Finally, they are focused down to about before entering the target chamber.
The experimental chamber consists of a diameter sphere of thick aluminum, weighing around 140 metric tons. It is covered by a layer of borated concrete that forms a biological shield.
Experiments.
Like NIF, LMJ intends to use the ""indirect drive" approach, where the laser light is used to heat a high-Z cylinder made of some heavy metal (often gold) known as a "hohlraum"". The hohlraum then gives off x-rays, which are used to heat a small fuel pellet containing a deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion fuel.
Although considerable laser energy is lost to heating the hohlraum, x-rays are much more efficient at heating the fuel pellet, making the indirect drive method applicable to nuclear weapons research. The x-rays heat the outer layer of the pellet so quickly that it explodes outward, causing the remainder of the pellet to be forced inward and causes a shock wave to travel in through the pellet to the middle. When the shock wave converges from all directions and meets in the middle, the density and temperature briefly reach the Lawson criterion and start fusion reactions. If the rate of reactions is high enough the heat generated by these reactions will cause surrounding fuel to fuse as well. This continues until the majority of the fuel in the pellet is consumed. This process is known as "ignition", and has long been a goal of fusion researchers.
History.
Construction on the Laser Mégajoule started with a single prototype beamline known as the Ligne d'Intégration Laser (Laser Integration Line), or LIL, powered by a 450 MJ energy bank. It was essentially a smaller version of the lines in the main design, with four beams instead of eight. It came online in 2002 and made 1,595 pulses and carried out 636 experiments before it shut down in February 2014. Its last experiment was carried out by LULI, Ecole Polytechnique and CELIA at the University of Bordeaux.
LMJ was delayed several times, but only for short periods. Designed to come into operation in early 2014, the schedule was pushed back to December, but ultimately pushed forward again to October.

Jeongja station

Jeongja Station (formerly Baekgung station) is a station on the Suin–Bundang Line and the Shinbundang Line, an express subway in South Korea.
It was the southern terminus of the Shinbundang Line, between October 2011 and January 2016, when the Shinbundang Line extended to Gwanggyo station. However, it still exists as a divide in terms of fare since riders need to pay an extra charge of 300 won (on top of the 900 won charge of using the Shinbundang Line) when crossing this station, due to the owners of Phase 1 and 2 being different. This rule only applies to the Shinbundang Line - Riders of the Bundang Line pay the normal minimum fare of 1,250 won.

Neil Roberts (Welsh footballer)

Neil Roberts (born 7 April 1978) is a Welsh former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is working as a project manager for Manchester City.
Roberts started his professional playing career with local Welsh side Wrexham in 1994. He moved to English side Wigan Athletic in 2000, and later from there to Doncaster Rovers in 2004. Roberts was first capped for the Wales national team in 1999, earning four caps for the senior team until 2004. He retired from football in 2009, following the end of his contract with Rhyl F.C.
Career.
Roberts started his career in 1994 when he played for Wrexham. After signing for the club as a trainee, he made his debut on 27 September 1997 during a 0–0 draw with Chesterfield before going on to score five goals in his next four games. He became an established first-team player at the Racecourse Ground, making 75 appearances and scoring 17 goals. He left Wrexham in 2000 to join Wigan Athletic, where he made 125 appearances and scoring 19 goals. He also spent time on loan at Hull City and Bradford City, scoring on his debut for the latter against Bristol City. He then made a permanent move to Doncaster Rovers in 2004.
In 2006 Roberts came back to his hometown club Wrexham, where he became the team captain. He is a Welsh international with four caps. Roberts had a good start to the 2006–07 season by scoring two goals in the first two games. These goals were very important during this period as they were a penalty in a 2–1 away victory against local rivals Chester City on 20 August 2006 and the opening goal in Wrexham's 4–1 League Cup victory at Championship side Sheffield Wednesday on 23 August 2006.
However, in their 2–1 victory against Swindon Town on 9 September 2006, Roberts picked up an injury. He made his comeback in a 2–1 defeat against Milton Keynes Dons scoring the opening goal. However, Roberts suffered more injuries throughout the course of the season. On 21 April 2007 he came on as a second-half substitute in a game against Torquay United and scored his first goal since October 2006 and Wrexham's winning goal to ensure a vital 1–0 win in Wrexham's bid for survival in the Football League Two. He was released by Wrexham in May 2008 following the club's relegation to the Football Conference.
On 24 June 2008, Roberts signed for Welsh Premier League side Rhyl, where he combined playing with coaching opportunities and his business interests. After one season at Rhyl, Roberts left to take over as a project manager at Premier League side Manchester City.
Personal life.
Neil's brother Stephen also played for Wrexham between 1998 and 2005, while his daughter Mia Roberts played for Wrexham A.F.C. Women until she left the team on 11 August 2023.
He is currently the proprietor of a Wrexham pub known as Vault 33 where his other children Sam Roberts and Macy Roberts work with him

Alonso Fajardo de Tenza

Don Alonso Fajardo de Tenza y de Guevara, Córdoba y Velasco, Knight of Alcantara, Lord of Espinardo (died July 1624, in the Philippines) was Spanish Governor-General and Captain-General of the Islands of the Philippines from 3 July 1618 until his death.
Biography.
Fajardo de Tenza was a native of Murcia, son of Admiral Don Luis Fajardo and wife Doña Luisa de Tenza, Lady of Espinardo, and a Knight of the Order of Alcántara. He arrived at Cavite in the Philippines on 2 July 1618, and took up the governorship the following day. (Although some sources say he took office on 8 June.) He took over from the "Audiencia" of Manila, which had been governing the colony since 1616 in the absence (and later death) of the previous Viceroy, Juan de Silva.
The sixth Dutch blockade of Manila took place between 12 October 1618 and the end of May 1619. Anticipating the blockade, Governor Fajardo sent a ship to Macau in September 1618 to buy ammunition, to engage in trade and, through the embassy of Dominican Father Bartolomé Martínez, to warn the Chinese against sending sampans to Manila, as they would surely be intercepted by the Dutch fleet.
In early May 1619, some Japanese ships arrived at Manila and were allowed to enter the harbor by the Dutch. At the same time, Governor Fajardo was preparing a defensive fleet. He was able to assemble two large ships, two medium-sized ships, two pataches and four galleys. When the Dutch realized the Spaniards were ready to fight, they left the vicinity of Manila. They went on to pillage a native town in Ilocos and then left the archipelago. Some Dutch galleons were reportedly sunk at Ilocos.
In February 1620 Governor Fajardo dispatched an expedition under Captain García de Aldana y Cabrera, Governor of Pangasinan, to find and take control of gold mines said to be in the possession of Indigenous in Itogon. The expedition reached Bua, which they found burned to the ground. However they constructed a fort there, which they named "Santísima Trinidad". An inspection of the mines showed them to be comparatively deep and provided with an extensive drainage system, although some were filled with water. Only one appeared to have a considerable vein of ore. This one extended to a depth and width of twenty meters and had been worked on by some eight hundred "Ygolotes".
Fajardo founded the Convent of Santa Clara in 1621.
Reportedly, his wife had an extramarital affair with a former Jesuit. In 1621 Governor Fajardo had her killed, and he demolished the house of her paramour, where the couple had apparently met. According to legend, tamarind trees spontaneously grew on the spot, which is said to be the symbol of the couple's bitter-sweet love affair. This location is still pointed out to visitors in Manila. It is Plaza Samplucan, on General Luna Street in Intramuros, Manila.
In 1623 Governor Fajardo suppressed an insurrection in the Visayas. The following July (1624), he died, reportedly from melancholy. Again, the "Audiencia" took over in the absence of a viceroy, until Fernándo de Silva arrived from New Spain in June 1625.
His nephew, Diego Fajardo Chacón, was also Governor of the Philippines, from 1644 to 1653.

Jacob Avigdor

Rabbi Dr. Yaakov (also Jacob) Avigdor (March 20, 1896–March 30, 1967) was a Polish-Mexican rabbi, author and Holocaust survivor. Prior to the Holocaust he served as Chief Rabbi of Drohobych - Boryslav in Poland, and after the war, as rabbi of the Ashkenazi community in Mexico.
Life.
Jacob Avigdor was born into a rabbinic family in Tyrawa Wołoska, a shtetl in the Austrian province of Galicia between the cities of Sanok and Przemyśl (now southeast Poland) in 1896. He excelled in religious studies, and being considered a prodigy, was ordained at the young age of 16 years. Later he studied at the universities in Kraków and Lviv, obtaining a PhD in Philosophy. Acquiring a high reputation as an orator and Talmudist, he was named Chief Rabbi of Drohobych and Boryslav, then in southeast Poland (now western Ukraine) in 1920 (age 24), where he officiated until the Nazi occupation. Being District Rabbi of about 80 surrounding villages, he also served as head ("Av") of the Beth din.
He officiated at the wedding of future Prime Minister of Israel Menachem Begin and Aliza Arnold in May of 1939 which took place at the Eden Hotel in Truskavets, Poland, which was a summer resort near Drohobych.
During the Holocaust, he lost his wife, his two daughters and his brother David the Rabbi of Andrychów, among many family members. After his liberation from the Buchenwald concentration camp, Avigdor became extremely active in the efforts of rescue and rehabilitation of Jewish refugees in postwar Europe. After immigrating to the U.S. in 1946, he accepted a pulpit in Brooklyn, New York, and six years later he was offered the rabbinate of Mexico, holding that position until his death in Mexico City in 1967.
Rabbi Dr. Avigdor was much consulted on religious and ethical questions by worldwide peers. A prolific writer, his topics included religious philosophy, Jewish history and traditions, and commentary on Biblical text. Most of his prewar works were lost. In Mexico, he became a regular contributor to Yiddish periodicals, and published books in that language, Hebrew and Spanish. The Holocaust Museum at Yad Vashem holds a Hebrew calendar written by him from memory during his stay at Buchenwald (to view it, see below External Links).
Reuniting with son Isaac.
Rabbi Avigdor's son, Rabbi , also survived the war (at Mauthausen concentration camp). He had seen the death of a man, and not long after the war, at a DP camp in Italy, he wrote a document for his widow as witness. As she relocated to Germany and wanted to remarry, the senior Rabbi Jacob Avigdor, at the time head of the Jewish court in postwar Bergen-Belsen, needed proof that the woman's husband had died. She gave Rabbi Jacob the formal document written by Rabbi Isaac. This is how the father found out the son was still alive, allowing them to reunite, many months after the war.
Rabbi Isaac included this story in a book about his father's life, "Faith After the Flames: The Life of Rabbi Dr. Yaakov Avigdor" and details are included in a published book review. The story of the father, the son, and the widow is also told by Holocaust writer Esther Farbstein in her "Hidden in Thunder: Perspective on Faith, Halachah and Leadership, volume 1"
Rabbi Isaac C. Avigdor (1920-2010), son of Rabbi Jacob Avigdor, became a community rabbi in Connecticut "for a half century", and for decades a columnist in The Jewish Press.

He is also an experienced jazz, rock, and folk musician. He wrote his first game in 1965.
In 1982, he was hired as the first employee by the Computer Division of Lucasfilm to start Lucasfilm Games. He hired the programming and design teams and wrote the music for and contributed to the game design of Lucasfilm Games' first two releases, "Ballblazer" and "Rescue on Fractalus!". In fact, for "Ballblazer", Langston created an algorithmic composition system, which allowed the game to improvise music (from an initial set of musical snippets contributed by famous musicians) based on what is happening in the game. Langston later left Lucasfilm Games for Bellcore (now Telcordia Technologies). Langston retired in 1991, and is now consulting and running adult music camps.

S225XR

S225XR was a wingless, integrated rocket/ramjet powered, active radar-guided medium-range air-to-air missile concept initially proposed by a BAe Dynamics led team to meet the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence's, requirement for a missile to arm Eurofighter. S225XR was the ultimate in a series of proposed developments of the BAe Dynamics Skyflash pursued jointly by the UK and Sweden since the late 1970s.
In 1978 Sweden bought the rights to Skyflash, known as Rb 71 in Flygvapnet service, from BAe. Sweden's Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) subsequently began an independent development of Skyflash with a new active seeker, with BAe acting as a sub-contractor to Sweden's Saab Dynamics.
In 1984 the FMV began renewed studies of their active seeker design, the Rb 71A, or Sky Flash 90, and the all-new wingless ramjet-powered Rb 73. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed with BAe Dynamics that same year to co-operate on Rb 73 development. Studies were conducted on longer range designs with wings and datalinks, the Rb 73D/Rb 73DL. A lack of FMV funding brought the Rb 73 programme to a halt in 1987.
In 1988 BAe Dynamics and Thomson-CSF (now Thales) agreed to jointly fund development of a version of Skyflash with an active radar seeker. The Active Sky Flash (ASF) was to include a Thomson-CSF seeker and a new warhead developed by LFK, the guided missile division of Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA) now known as MBDA Deutschland GmbH. Concepts progressed from the basic ASF to the agile tail-controlled ASF TC Mk. II. Prototype seekers were delivered in 1990 with air-carriage trials in 1991.
Saab Dynamics continued to refine the Rb 73 design using company funds and renewed links were established with BAe Dynamics, to meet the emerging requirement to arm the RAF's Eurofighters. As Eurofighter became the driver behind the missile's development, BAe took charge of the programme. ASF was terminated in 1992 to be replaced by a new wingless concept known as S225X, the name deriving from the internal postal code of the BAe project manager's office at Stevenage.
S225X was first unveiled at the 1992 Farnborough Air Show. GEC-Marconi Dynamics and Alenia Difesa joined the programme in 1993. In 1994 a ramjet powered version, known as S225XR, was proposed in response to the UK requirement for a future medium-range air-to-air missile for Eurofighter. This team became part of the European group which eventually won the competition with Meteor.

The Prix de Sandringham is a Group 2 flat horse race in France open to three-year-old thoroughbred fillies. It is run at Chantilly over a distance of 1,600 metres (about 1 mile), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late May or early June.
History.
The event was originally called the Prix des Lilas, and it used to be held at Longchamp. During the early part of its history it was contested over 2,000 metres, and it served as a trial for the Prix de Diane. It was cut to its present distance in 1966.
The race was titled the Coupe de Sa Majesté la Reine Elizabeth in 1972, in honour of Queen Elizabeth II, who was attending Longchamp during a state visit to France. It was renamed after Sandringham, the location of the Royal Stud, in 1973.
The Prix de Sandringham was first run at Chantilly in 1977. It returned to Longchamp the following year, and it was transferred more permanently to Chantilly in 1979. For a period it held Group 3 status, and it was promoted to Group 2 level in 2001. It is now staged on the same day as the Prix du Jockey Club.

Arf invariant of a knot

In the mathematical field of knot theory, the Arf invariant of a knot, named after Cahit Arf, is a knot invariant obtained from a quadratic form associated to a Seifert surface. If "F" is a Seifert surface of a knot, then the homology group has a quadratic form whose value is the number of full twists mod 2 in a neighborhood of an embedded circle representing an element of the homology group. The Arf invariant of this quadratic form is the Arf invariant of the knot.
Definition by Seifert matrix.
Let formula_1 be a Seifert matrix of the knot, constructed from a set of curves on a Seifert surface of genus "g" which represent a basis for the first homology of the surface. This means that "V" is a matrix with the property that is a symplectic matrix. The "Arf invariant" of the knot is the residue of 
Specifically, if formula_3, is a symplectic basis for the intersection form on the Seifert surface, then 
where lk is the link number and formula_5 denotes the positive pushoff of "a".
Definition by pass equivalence.
This approach to the Arf invariant is due to Louis Kauffman. 
We define two knots to be pass equivalent if they are related by a finite sequence of pass-moves.
Every knot is pass-equivalent to either the unknot or the trefoil; these two knots are not pass-equivalent and additionally, the right- and left-handed trefoils are pass-equivalent.
Now we can define the Arf invariant of a knot to be 0 if it is pass-equivalent to the unknot, or 1 if it is pass-equivalent to the trefoil. This definition is equivalent to the one above.
Definition by partition function.
Vaughan Jones showed that the Arf invariant can be obtained by taking the partition function of an Ising model on a knot diagram.
Definition by Alexander polynomial.
This approach to the Arf invariant is by Raymond Robertello. Let
be the Alexander polynomial of the knot. Then the Arf invariant is the residue of
modulo 2, where for "n" odd, and for "n" even.
Kunio Murasugi proved that the Arf invariant is zero if and only if .
Arf as knot concordance invariant.
From the Fox-Milnor criterion, which tells us that the Alexander polynomial of a slice knot formula_8 factors as formula_9 for some polynomial formula_10 with integer coefficients, we know that the determinant formula_11 of a slice knot is a square integer. As formula_11 is an odd integer, it has to be congruent to 1 modulo 8. Combined with Murasugi's result, this shows that the Arf invariant of a slice knot vanishes.

Coronation Oath Act 1688

The Coronation Oath Act 1688 (1 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 6) is an act of the Parliament of England. It was passed in 1689.
The preamble noted that "by the Law and Ancient Usage of this Realm" the monarchs of England had taken a solemn oath at their coronation to maintain the statute laws and customs of the country and of its inhabitants, but the text of this oath had become partly meaningless over time, "framed in doubtful Words and Expressions with relation to ancient Laws and Constitutions at this time unknown". It established a single uniform oath to be taken by future monarchs at their coronation, and also established that this oath was to be taken by William III and Mary II when they were crowned.
The oath was fundamentally different from the traditional coronation oath which recognised laws as being the grant of the king whereas the act's oath sought to bind the king to rule according to the law agreed in Parliament. At the forefront of the oath, then, is the distillation of the core principle of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, namely an assertion of the constitutional supremacy of Parliament, a principle that remains the basis of public law in the United Kingdom.
The oath was shorter than the one used in 1660, removing a number of awkward phrases and references to past monarchs; a significant alteration was the explicit inclusion of an oath to maintain "the true Profession of the Gospel and the Protestant Reformed Religion Established by Law", rather than the somewhat more vague promise to "Protect and Defend the Bishops and Churches under [my] Government."
Section 2 of the Act of Settlement 1701 (12 &amp; 13 Will. 3. c. 2) reiterated the requirement to take the oath.
Subsequent developnents.
, the act mostly remains in force.
Section 4, from "bee it" to "enacted that" was repealed by section 1(1) of, and part I of the schedule to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1888 (51 &amp; 52 Vict. c. 3). The Scottish Claim of Right Act 1689 says that the monarch cannot "exercise the regal power until he or she swear the Coronation Oath."

Lunda Empire

The Lunda Empire or Kingdom of Lunda was a confederation of states in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, north-eastern Angola, and north-western Zambia. Its central state was in Katanga.
Origin.
Initially, the core of what would become the Lunda confederation was a commune called a "N'Gaange" in the kiLunda (kiyaka-kipunu) language. It was ruled over by a monarch called the Mwane-a- n'Gaange. One of these rulers, Ilunga Tshibinda, came from the nation of Luba where his brother ruled and married a royal woman from a nation to their south. Their son became the first paramount ruler of the Lunda, creating the title of Mwane-a-Yamvu (c. 1665).
Other sources state the first well-attested historical ruler of Lunda was Nawej, who begin his rule about 1695. His father was said to have come from Kalundwe, a Luba language-speaking state. It is unclear, though, how much of the traditions of the kingdom before Nawej are historically accurate.
Nawej is said by tradition to have created the office of queen mother, called Rukonkesh. A key part of this role was to help determine succession. He also created the office of Swan Mulond, which he gave to his mother Ruwej, and Swan Mulop, a title for the heir apparent. However these offices are only directly attested to by sources from the early 19th century.
Perpetual kingship was practised, whereby the king 'became' his predecessor, adopting his name, kinship relations, and duties. The royal centre of the empire was called "musumba", where each ruler assembled their court, surrounded by a moat and earthen walls. Within the "musumba" were paved roads, courtyards, and areas demarcated for rituals.
Expansion.
Lunda started in an area where traditional farming and thus settled existence was only generally done in river valleys. Just to the north is an area where the areas between rivers can also be inhabited. In its early history Lundu struggled primarily with the Luba-speaking people who lived downriver, and thus north of it. These people are sometimes referred to with names such as Sala Mpusa or Kete, which make it appear they were organized single states. However in reality they were loose confederations of shifting alliances.
It also early on faced off with Kanyok Kingdom, located to its north-west, also a Luba-speaking kingdom, but much larger than the various populations that existed in Kete and Sala Mpusa.
The first major military campaign by Nawej was against Sala Mpasu. He is said to have built a major fortress in Sala Mpasu territory, but was not at this stage able to exert control over them. Nawej removed his troops from Sala Mpasu in response to an invasion of his territory by forces from the Kingdom of Kanyok.
The Kanyok forces killed Nawej and established a fortress in Lunda territory. 
The next ruler, Muland, elected by the leaders of the state, was eventually able to drive out the Kanyok forces.
Muland is said to have resigned infavor of Nawej's son Muted. It seems to have been at this point that rule became hereditary within the descendants of Nawej.&lt;Thornton. "West Central Africa". p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;
Muted was succeeded by his nephew Yava a Nawej. One of the leading "karula" in the empire, the class who helped chose the new Emperor, Mai, was the main leader of expansion under Yava during the 1720s or so, pushing the boundary of Lunda past the Kasai River to the west. The Lulua resisted Mai's expansion. So Muteb, the son of the last unrelated ruler Muland, lead a northwest movement along the Kwilu.
Apex.
The Lunda Kingdom controlled some 150,000 km2 by 1680. The state doubled in size to around 300,000 km2 at its height in the 19th century. The "Mwane-a Yamvo" of Lunda became powerful militarily from their base of 175,000 inhabitants. Along with this military strength through sheer numbers, the Lunda Kingdom also received Muslim military advisors and some dated weapons from the cities of Nyangwe and Kabambare. Through marriage with descendants of the Luba kings, they gained political ties. 
The Lunda people were able to settle and colonize other areas and tribes, thus extending their kingdom through southwest Katanga into Angola and north-western Zambia, and eastwards across Katanga into what is now the Luapula Province of Zambia. The kingdom became a confederation of a number of chieftainships that enjoyed a degree of local autonomy (as long as tributes were paid), with Mwata Yamvo as paramount ruler and a ruling council (following the Luba model) to assist with administration.
The strength of the kingdom enabled it to conquer the territory of other tribes, especially to the east. In the 18th century, a number of migrations took place as far as the region to the south of Lake Tanganyika. The Bemba people of Northern Zambia descended from Luba migrants who arrived in Zambia throughout the 17th century. At the same time, a Lunda chief and warrior called Mwata Kazembe set up an Eastern Lunda kingdom in the valley of the Luapula River.
Collapse.
The kingdom of Lunda came to an end in the 19th century, when it was invaded by the Chokwe, who were armed with guns. The Chokwe then established their own kingdom with their language and customs. Lunda chiefs and people continued to live in the Lunda heartland but were diminished in power. 
At the start of the colonial era (1884), the Lunda heartland was divided between Portuguese Angola, King Leopold II of Belgium's Congo Free State and the British in North-Western Rhodesia, which became Angola, DR Congo and Zambia, respectively. The Lunda groups in Northern Rhodesia were led by two prominent chiefs, Ishindi and Kazembe Kazembi, with Ishindi establishing his kingdom in the north-west of the country and Kazembe in the north-east. Of the two prominent chiefs, Ishindi was the first born of Mwanta Yamvo which Kazembe was made King as a result of reward for his loyalty to Mwanta Yamvo.

Johnny Varro

Johnny Varro (born 1930) is a pianist with roots in the swing style of jazz. He is also a leader and arranger.
Commodore Music Shop.
Varro was born in Brooklyn, New York. He began studying piano at the age of ten. During his teenage years, he was introduced to jazz by way of the Commodore Music Shop in New York City. There he met the manager Jack Crystal (father of Billy Crystal), who was running jam sessions on the Lower East Side. At these sessions, Johnny met some of the greatest players of the era, such as Willie "The Lion" Smith, Big Sid Catlett, Joe Thomas, Hot Lips Page, Joe Sullivan, Pete Brown and others. The experience of sitting in for Joe Sullivan and Willie "The Lion" Smith was invaluable and soon allowed Johnny to become a hired player.
New York: Bobby Hackett and Eddie Condon.
Johnny's first professional job was with Bobby Hackett touring the East Coast with his quartet. In 1954 he worked at Nick's with Phil Napoleon and later with Pee Wee Erwin. In 1957 Eddie Condon asked Johnny to play at his club as intermission pianist. During that gig, he met more musicians who began calling him for jobs. The Condon gig extended into Johnny becoming Condon's band pianist. The players in Condon's band at this time included Buck Clayton, Wild Bill Davison, Pee Wee Russell, Cutty Cutshall, Lou McGarity, George Wettling, Yank Lawson, Peanuts Hucko and others.
For the next several years between the Condon tours, Johnny worked most of the jazz rooms around New York including The Embers, The Roundtable, Condon's Uptown (with Edmond Hall), The Metropole and many others. Musicians such as Henry "Red" Allen, Roy Eldridge, Coleman Hawkins, Bobby Hackett, Charlie Shavers, Jo Jones and Jonah Jones helped further his musical education.
Dukes of Dixieland and the Gleason Show.
In 1965 he moved to Miami Beach and worked on the Jackie Gleason Show. He also worked with Flip Phillips, Billy Butterfield, Phil Napoleon and toured with the Dukes of Dixieland.
Gatsby's and Swing 7.
Then came another move in 1979 to Los Angeles, California, where he lived, played and toured for the next 14 years. He played with Eddie Miller, Dick Cathcart, Tommy Newsom, Red Norvo, Abe Lincoln, Bob Havens, and Jack Sheldon. He also did a five-year solo stint at Gatsby's Restaurant in Brentwood. It was in Los Angeles where the idea was born to organize a swing group covering the styles of the '30s, '40s, and '50s. This group, known as the Swing 7, has played many of the Jazz festivals and parties.
Arbors Records, concerts, and jazz festivals.
The last move took him in 1993 to Florida where he now resides, in the Tampa Bay area. He has many recordings on a variety of labels. The most recent recordings have been for Arbors Records where he has recorded extensively in solo, trio and band format under his own name. He also has recorded many times as a sideman for Arbors. And he can be heard on several recordings on the Nagel-Heyer label (Hamburg, Germany).
He continues to play jazz festivals, jazz parties and concerts in the United States, Switzerland, and Germany. Jazz festivals include San Diego, Sacramento (Emperor in 2003), Odessa, Elkhart, and Roswell.

Howard Forinton

Howard Lee Forinton (born 18 September 1975) is a former professional footballer who played as a striker.
Forinton made 65 appearances and scored 14 goals in the Football League playing for Birmingham City, Plymouth Argyle, Peterborough United and Torquay United. Forinton also managed at Southern Football League side Woodford United having been appointed in September 2012 though he departed in November 2012 with the club rooted to the bottom of the table.
Career.
Forinton was born in Boston, Lincolnshire. He began his football career as an apprentice at Oxford United, but was released at the end of his apprenticeship. He joined Abingdon Town and, after a short spell at Oxford City, he joined Yeovil Town where he scored 23 goals in just 25 matches. His prolific scoring soon caught the eye of Birmingham City boss Trevor Francis, who paid £75,000 for him. He made very few first-team appearances but finished as top scorer for Birmingham's reserve team in both of his seasons at the club. While at Birmingham City he went on loan to both Plymouth Argyle and Blackpool.
In November 1999, he signed for Peterborough United for £250,000. However, after a number of injuries he failed to impress. He looked set to join Plymouth Argyle in July 2000, but remained with Peterborough and joined Yeovil Town on loan in 2001.
Forinton moved to Torquay United on a free transfer in August 2002, signing on a non-contract basis, and made just one appearance, in which he set up a goal, before the club decided not to offer him a further deal. He returned to Yeovil on a monthly contract later the same month, but was released in November 2002 while awaiting operations on both ankles. He joined Oxford City the following month, and then moved to Stevenage Borough in June 2003, but was released in September 2003 and returned to Oxford City the following month.
In November 2003 Forinton moved to Farnborough Town. He then moved to Banbury United in June 2004, leaving to join Halesowen Town in May 2005. After one season at Halesowen he re-signed for Banbury in May 2006. In October 2006 he rejected a move to Bath City, opting to stay at Banbury to take on a player/coach role in the club.
Forinton left Banbury United after the departure of manager Kevin Brock to join Redditch United in June 2007, but rejoined Banbury United in October 2008.
At the end of 2009, Forinton left Banbury United for Woodford United in the Southern League Midlands Division, to pursue a player/coach role. After a spell with Daventry Town, Forinton returned to Banbury United for the 2012–13 season in a player/coach capacity before departing just two months later after the playing budget was cut. Forinton returned to Woodford United having taken up his first managerial post, in 2012. However, he resigned in November 2012 after only two months in the job, and was one of many Woodford managers during the 2012–13 season which culminated in their relegation from the Southern Football League in 2013 with the unwanted record of having lost all 42 matches.

Corrupt Practices Act 1695

The Corrupt Practices Act 1695 (7 &amp; 8 Will. 3. c. 4) or the Treating Act 1695 was an act of the Parliament of England passed in 1696, the long title of which is "An Act for preventing Charge and Expence in Elections of Members to serve in Parliament." It was intended to counter bribery of the electorate at parliamentary elections, and it established that no candidate was to make any "Gift Reward or Entertainment" to a particular person, or a place in general, in order to be elected to serve in Parliament. This included acts by the candidate themselves, on their behalf, or at their expense, and both direct or indirect activity. Any person found guilty of engaging in, promising, or allowing such behaviour was to be considered incapacitated from serving in Parliament, and would not be allowed to take their seat or vote. To all intents and purposes, this would annul their election as a member.
Subsequent developments.
The whole act was repealed by section 1 of the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act 1854 (17 &amp; 18 Vict. c. 102).

The Dark Wind

The Dark Wind is a crime novel by American writer Tony Hillerman, the fifth in the Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee Navajo Tribal Police series, published in 1982. It is the second of the novels to feature Officer Jim Chee.
Now working from Tuba City, Sgt. Chee is assigned four cases by Capt. Largo. A drug-smuggling plane crashes, and Largo insists Chee stay away from that case, a tough challenge as he gathers information from Hopis, European Americans, and Navajos to solve the original cases.
Reviewers found this to have a "classic Hillerman plot", involving a plane crash, possibly illegal drugs, and a vandalized windmill on the Joint-Use lands. It is "relentlessly introspective" and "with Hillerman's moodily fine prose in full Southwest regalia", as the Hopi and the Navajo ways are contrasted, and Chee explores a white man's motivation, of revenge.
Plot summary.
Jim Chee is assigned four cases to solve by Captain Largo, his new boss at the Tuba City, Arizona office of the Navajo Tribal Police. One is to ascertain who stole jewelry from the Burnt Water trading post, and to find the paroled man suspected of the thievery, Joseph Musket. The third is to find who is vandalizing a windmill in the Joint-Use lands recently allotted to the Hopi. Fourth is to learn the identity of the Navajo man found dead on the path to Kisigi Spring.
While he is on stakeout near the windmill one night, a small plane crash lands in the Wepo Wash. Chee runs to the crash, finding the pilot and his passenger dead, and a man sitting up in a business suit, holding a card, murdered. As he approaches, he hears someone leaving on foot in the early morning darkness. He also hears a gunshot, most likely the one that killed the man in the business suit, and sees headlights of a vehicle leaving the scene. The airplane was carrying illegal cargo, likely drugs, and the DEA agents, in particular T. L. Johnson, are possessive of their law enforcement turf.
As Chee collects information on Joseph Musket and on the unidentified corpse, he gradually learns information related to the crash and the drug deal. Johnson finds this as reason to invade Chee's home in the morning, including beating Chee up, in Johnson's usual style. Johnson puts forward that Chee was present so soon after the plane crashed because Chee is part of the drug smuggling.
The deteriorated condition of the corpse, found over a week after death, makes identification impossible. Later, Albert Lomatewa provides the exact date of death and how the corpse looked, hands and feet flayed as if by a Navajo "skinwalker", or witch. Chee meets Jake West, owner of the Burnt Water trading post, where the jewelry theft was reported, and briefly the employer of Musket. West's son, Thomas Rodney West, was killed recently in prison; he had been friends with Joseph Musket since childhood. Chee presses Cowboy Dashee to arrange an interview with the Hopi elder responsible for a shrine near the windmill. Dashee translates. Chee makes a deal with Taylor Sawkatewa: Chee will bring supplies to stop that windmill, which interferes with water flow around the shrine, in return for Sawkatewa telling all he saw and heard in the time it took Chee to reach the plane crash site. A man forced another to place the landing lights in the wrong place, and then shot him dead. Items were removed from the plane but they were not placed in the car that left the scene. From the pilot's sister, Chee learns a meeting is set up for transfer of the drugs during a private Hopi kachina ceremony. She wants revenge, or justice, for her brother's death. Revenge is not a Navajo concept, so Chee struggles to understand it as motivation.
Chee arrives at Sityatki, the old Hopi village, having retrieved the two aluminum suitcases filled with cocaine from their hiding place in the sand at the crash site. Both Jake West and Johnson appear, the former expected, the latter a surprise. West has killed the drug kingpin, figuring he is responsible for his son's murder while he was held in prison. Johnson is there not truly as a DEA agent, but as the man who wants these drugs, which he claims are worth $15 million. After Chee arrests and handcuffs West, Johnson does the same to Chee. As this encounter unfolds, a rare intense rainstorm breaks the long drought, rapidly making dangerous rivers in the usually dry arroyos. At Chee's vehicle, Johnson gets the suitcases of cocaine. Johnson's plan is to kill the other two. Chee explains how Johnson visited Thomas West in prison, such that the other prisoners assumed he was a snitch and killed him in regular confinement. Johnson could have handled that so Thomas lived. Jake West understands this means he killed the wrong man in revenge for his son's death. Chee grabs one suitcase and throws it at Johnson. It then slides to the river which horrifies Johnson, who runs to save the cocaine. West follows and pushes Johnson into the river. Chee tells West that the unidentified corpse will be checked against Joseph Musket's prison dental records, and it is clear that West killed Musket. West says that the jewelry reported stolen is hidden in his kitchen, just before he dies from the gunshot wound received from Johnson. West killed six men before reaching Johnson to avenge his son's murder. Chee reflects that all this time, Capt. Largo insisted that Chee stay out of the drug smuggling case. Not wanting to be criticized, Chee hurls the other suitcase full of cocaine into the raging river, all other active cases having been solved.
Reviews.
"Kirkus Reviews" finds this novel slower than earlier novels in this series, and introspective.
Strongly atmospheric but far less suspenseful than "People of Darkness", this second case for Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police (who's also an apprentice Navajo chanter/shaman) moves into the neighboring Hopi culture on the joint Southwest reservation--as Chee ponders possible connections among a quartet of simultaneous cases. There's a body found on Hopi territory--its feet and hands skinned: a sign of witchcraft afoot. There's a robbery by ex-con Joseph Musket, who has now weirdly disappeared. There's vandalism of a Hopi windmill (by angry, dispossessed Navajos. . . or by Hopis disturbed by a violation of ritual?). And, beyond Chee's official jurisdiction, there's a Mesa plane-crash-cum-murder, apparently involving drug-smuggling: where are the drugs? Chee broods about all these crimes; he himself is suspected by the FBI of complicity in the drug-caper. And, before he traps the murderer and exposes a revenge-motive, there are visits to a prison, a medicine-man, and (repeatedly) the bleak mesa. A few nice twists, with Hillerman's moodily fine prose in full Southwest regalia; but this time the darkness is murky almost as often as it's chilling--in the slowest, most relentlessly introspective case yet for the Navajo Tribal Police.
Another reviewer says "Dark Wind" is "The classic Hillerman plot: A plane crash, possibly tied to a drug deal, a corpse whose palms and feet have been scalped (destruction of evidence or Navajo corpse medicine?), and a traditional Hopi wanted for sabotaging a windmill, all wound together in a surprising and consistent conclusion. Hillerman concentrates this book on the distinctions between Hopi and Navajo, and he uses Chee's status as a traditional Navajo to advantage in a number of scenes."
Themes.
The novel has a major theme of the culture, religion and myths of the Hopi people, and some of the contrasts between Hopi ways and Navajo ways. The Hopi and the Navajos shared a view of the land that did not require rigid boundaries and exclusive ownership. Arrival of Europeans and contact with the US forced the notion of exclusive ownership, raising up problems of a new nature between the tribes. Views of nature and death are contrasted between the two cultures, especially in conversations between the Navajo policeman and the Hopi deputy sheriff. Revenge is another theme driving the plot, a concept Chee finds unfamiliar, so he studies it.
Allusions to real events and places.
The plot makes reference to Joint Use lands with both Navajo and Hopi making use of the land. This is a long-standing dispute, and even the resolution mentioned in the story, a 1974 public law and following court cases assigning one large area for the Hopi, requiring thousands of Navajos to move, did not resolve the issue. Although the situation was in some sense settled by a 1996 law, the issues continue to this day. The Hopi have lived in this large area for thousands of years, arriving before the Navajo. Further, the people of each tribe have different patterns of settlement (Navajo are dispersed over larger amount of land, originally from their occupation as sheepherders, while the Hopi are generally settled in villages, raise corn, make art and jewelry).
The corpse is found on the path to Kisigi Spring, which is an important Hopi spruce shrine. It is a real place, but its exact location is not mapped, to keep it more private.
The Hopi village of Sikyatki is more of a ruin than the novel suggests, Tony Hillerman says in the author's note. "Time has been even crueler to the village of Sikyatki than is suggested herein. It was abandoned long ago and sand has drifted over what remains of its ruins."
The ceremonies and sacred places of the Hopi on the mesas in their reservation are mentioned often and incorporated in the plot. Hillerman says "Like Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police, I am an outsider on the Hopi Mesas. I know only what one learns from long and respectful interest, and suggest that any of you who wish to learn more of the complex Hopi metaphysics turn to more knowledgeable writers. I particularly recommend "The Book of the Hopi" by my good friend Frank Waters."
Geography.
In his 2011 book "Tony Hillerman's Navajoland: Hideouts, Haunts, and Havens in the Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee Mysteries", author has listed the following 63 geographical locations mentioned in "The Dark Wind". 
Adaptations.
The novel was adapted as the feature film "The Dark Wind" in 1991. It starred Lou Diamond Phillips as Jim Chee, Fred Ward as Joe Leaphorn and Gary Farmer as Cowboy Dashee. It was directed by Errol Morris, a documentary film-maker making his dramatic feature debut. Robert Redford was executive producer, hoping for a series of films, but he was unhappy with the production and director. In an article on the successful adaptation of "Skinwalkers" in 2002, Redford said of "The Dark Wind" that "The film, says Redford, wasn't any good and wasn't released. "That was a false start," Redford says. "It was miscast. It was ill-conceived and I didn't think it was the right beginning for the series. It wasn't distributed.""
There are substantial differences between the movie and the novel, as the movie focussed heavily on the conflict that arose between Navajo and Hopi in the Joint Use areas, and the subsequent court case that decided the issues, where the novel has four cases for Jim Chee to solve, and in the process to aid the federal agencies in the case of the crashed plane carrying drugs into the US.
Redford would later bring the series to PBS's "Mystery", making three films from later novels in the series.

Popery Act 1698

The Popery Act 1698 (11 Will. 3. c. 4) was an act of the Parliament of England enacted in 1700. The long title of the Act was "An Act for the further preventing the Growth of Popery".
Section I of the act was intended to address an alleged recent growth of Roman Catholicism by ensuring the existing anti-Catholic laws were more strongly applied. To that end, the section provided that any person who apprehended a "Popish Bishop, Priest or Jesuite" who was then prosecuted for "saying Mass or exerciseing any other Part of the Office or Function of a Popish Bishop or Priest within these Realmes" would receive £100 from the Sheriff of that county within four months of the priest's conviction. In effect, it placed a bounty on Roman Catholic priests.
Section II of the act provided for the Treasury to reimburse Sheriffs for money expended on such payments.
Section III of the act, expanding on the existing legislation, enacted that if a Catholic priest celebrated Mass, etc., as above, or if any Catholic clergyman or layperson ran a school or "take upon themselves the Education or Government or Boarding of Youth"; he was on conviction liable to "perpetuall Imprisonment" at the discretion of the King. Despite its severity, that was to some extent a mitigation of the provisions of the Jesuits, etc. Act 1584 ([27 Eliz. 1. c. 2), which prescribed the death penalty for any priest who failed to leave England within 40 days of being so ordered.
Another provision disallowed Catholic schooling, inheritance and purchase of land.
Subsequent developments.
The Papists Act 1778 (18 Geo. 3. c. 60) exempted those taking the oath under that act from some of the provisions of the Popery Act 1698. The section as to taking and prosecuting priests was repealed, as was the penalty of perpetual imprisonment for keeping a school. The whole act was repealed by section 1 of the Religious Disabilities Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. 59).

All Souls' Day (film)

All Souls' Day or Hallowe'en is the English title for "Zaduszki", a film released in 1962, directed by the Polish film director Tadeusz Konwicki.
Much like Konwicki's 1958 film "The Last Day of Summer", "All Souls' Day" is a story of survivors and the lasting psychic damage of World War II. In both films, the director embraces his position as a film amateur, self-consciously avoiding genre conventions. Unlike his earlier effort, however, "All Souls' Day" is driven by more conventional plot and dialogue elements that move beyond experimental filmmaking.
The film won the Special Jury Award at the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg in 1962.
Plot.
Two young lovers, Wala (Ewa Krzyzewska) and Michael (Edmund Fetting), travel to a provincial town to spend the weekend at a small hotel. Memories of the war and Wala's guilt in the wake of a previous lover's death hang in the air. While both Michael and Wala are starving for love, they cannot transcend their wartime experiences.

Nomansland is a hamlet in Devon, England, with a population of about 150. It is eight miles west of Tiverton. It is so named because it was at one time a remote extra-parochial area where the Parishes of Witheridge, Thelbridge and Cruwys Morchard met (as they still do, but Nomansland is no longer extra-parochial). The hamlet is administered by Mid Devon District Council but is very close to the boundary between the Mid Devon District Council and North Devon District Council. It is in the parliamentary constituency of Central Devon.
There is a pub, the Mount Pleasant Inn, in the hamlet. The pub was listed for sale in 2024.

Peter McDougall

Peter McDougall (born 1947, Greenock, Scotland) is a Scottish television playwright whose major success was in the 1970s.
McDougall claims to have had very little schooling and to rarely read books. He began his working life at the age of fourteen in the shipyards of Greater Glasgow and Greenock with future comedian and actor Billy Connolly. Depressed by the harsh conditions and unfulfilled by the menial work, he left Scotland and moved to London, where he worked as a house-painter.
It was while painting Colin Welland's house that McDougall impressed the actor and writer when relating tales of being the drum major in the Orange walk as a teenager. He was advised to try writing a television play about this and the result was "Just Another Saturday", which McDougall wrote in secret and hid even from his first wife, a teacher nearly a decade his senior. Once completed, the script was sent to the BBC "Play for Today" team, who were enormously impressed but rejected the play because of the sensitive subject matter. McDougall was however asked to try again, and wrote a more intimate piece "Just Your Luck" (1972) based on his sister's wedding, again exploring the sectarian divide in its story of a Protestant girl who finds herself pregnant by a Catholic boy.
The play caused a furore in Scotland, many people appalled by its portrayal of the people's earthiness and prejudice. However, there was much positive praise too, one viewer even going so far as to say it was "the most exciting debut since "Look Back in Anger"."
At that point, the director John Mackenzie began enquiring after the script of "Just Another Saturday" and managed to get the play into production, only to then find the piece banned after the head of the Glasgow police said that the script would cause "bloodshed on the streets in the making and in the showing". After a year Mackenzie managed to persuade the Head of BBC Television Alasdair Milne to press ahead with the play, although some scenes were eventually filmed in Edinburgh to minimise controversy.
The finished film, the script of which was barely changed from the first draft, won massive acclaim on its first transmission in 1975, gained several repeats, and won its author the Prix Italia. McDougall followed this success up with a short kitchen comedy for BBC2, "A Wily Couple" (1976), part of the "Centre Play" series and another "Play for Today", "The Elephants' Graveyard" (1976). During this time McDougall got the opportunity to work with talented and influential producers such as Graeme Macdonald, who later became overall Head Of Drama at the BBC in the 1980s.
Several other television projects ensued, including an aborted sitcom, until McDougall and Mackenzie collaborated again on their final "Play for Today", "Just a Boys' Game" (1979). Starring blues singer Frankie Miller this was the story of Greenock razor gangs and specifically of one man's life of alcohol and violence over a twenty-four-hour period. His most violent piece, "Just A Boy's Game" the film was also notable for supporting performances from a then unknown Gregor Fisher, Ken Hutchison, comedian Hector Nicol and Jean Taylor Smith. Martin Scorsese has since stated that the bar room brawl scene and its bleak moody atmosphere made the film the Scottish equivalent of "Mean Streets".
McDougall also wrote the BBC supernatural drama "Tarry-Dan Tarry-Dan Scarey Old Spooky Man" set in Cornwall about a troubled teenager experiencing dreams of an ancient family curse. Only broadcast once in May 1978 and directed by John Reardon. Mackenzie and McDougall's last collaboration was on the STV film "A Sense of Freedom" (also 1979), based on the autobiography of Glaswegian gangster Jimmy Boyle, detailing his crimes and subsequent reform.
McDougall's subsequent plays "Shoot For The Sun" (1986), a bleak BBC drama starring Jimmy Nail and Brian Cox about Edinburgh's heroin problem, and "Down Where the Buffalo Go" (1988) starring Harvey Keitel, and "Down Among The Big Boys" (1993) did not meet with as significant critical acclaim. However he has remained good friends since with Keitel, who played the lead in "Down Where the Buffalo Go". Keitel was caught wearing a “Get Me Peter” T-shirt during the filming of "Down Where the Buffalo Go" in a declaration of disillusionment with the director Ian Knox, and his bond with McDougall.
In 1994, McDougall was caught remarking upon the appointment of BBC's new Head of Drama, future "Last King Of Scotland" producer Andrea Calderwood, that the BBC should never had given the job to a "wee lassie". The two later made up and Calderwood was later invited round McDougall's for dinner, with Billy Connolly and Brian Cox present.
McDougall was assaulted in Glasgow's West End in 1995, with an assailant brandishing a knife whilst walking home with his son. He was stabbed above the eye and taken to the Western Infirmary, where his wounds required more than 20 stitches.
In 2004, McDougall wrote three short dramas for the stage, starring - amongst others - Robbie Coltrane and Sean Scanlan, which were presented at the Òran Mór in Glasgow as part of the lunchtime theatre event A Play, A Pie and A Pint. He was at this point working on remakes of the Ealing films "The Maggie" and "Whisky Galore" but spoke out furiously when his proposed casting of Robbie Coltrane and Robert Carlyle was passed on in favour of English actors. A company, Whiskey Galore Films, was established which included producer Stephen Evans to develop "Whisky Galore".
In October 2007, a DVD boxed set featuring most of McDougall's work, "The Peter McDougall Collection" was released by John Williams Productions. This collection featured three "Play for Today" titles:" Just Another Saturday", "The Elephant's Graveyard", "Just A Boy's Game", and a "Screen One" drama: "Down Among the Big Boys".
McDougall was finally awarded with a BAFTA in 2008 when he received a lifetime achievement award - for "Outstanding contribution to Scottish broadcasting". A retrospective multiple screening of John Mackenzie and McDougall's collaborations was also shown at the Edinburgh International Festival in 2009.
McDougall was also one of a number of prominent Scots who attended the 2010 funeral of Trade Union Leader Jimmy Reid.
As of 2011, McDougall has written a screenplay adaptation of the James Hogg novel "The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner", which has garnered interest from long-time friends Billy Connolly and Robbie Coltrane as well as Kelly Macdonald. The script is currently being viewed by Robert Pattinson and would lead to a remarkable comeback if taken into development.
Scottish filmmaker Eleanor Yule has also made a documentary for the BBC "Late Show" on the work of McDougall.
McDougall currently lives in the West End of Glasgow with his partner, acclaimed director and writer Morag Fullarton, and often can be seen frequenting the Òran Mór theatre pub in the West of Glasgow.

Leslie Ballamy

Leslie Mark Ballamy (28 December 1903 – 16 July 1991) was a British inventor and automotive engineer who had a major impact on the British motorsport scene both before the Second World War and in the post-war period. His business L.M.B. Components Ltd was located in Guildford, Surrey.
Early life.
Bellamy was born in Walworth, England, to George William Ballamy and Elizabeth Caroline Ballamy.
History.
Looking to improve the handling of the Austin 7, in 1933, Ballamy split the front beam axle into twin swing arms that pivoted from a central joint. It is for this simple innovation that Ballamy became renowned. Soon afterwards, he put into production his swing axles for the Austin and the Ford 8, 10 and V8 models. Ballamy also converted more up-market cars such as Allard, Bugatti, Delage, and Bentley.
The backbone of LMB Components’ business was this suspension system which they later complemented by offering a softer spring and panhard rod combination for the live rear axle. LMB's suspension, engine and transmission conversions became a passport to success on race tracks, hill-climbs and trials venues and proved popular with some of Britain's top sportsmen. They could also be used on road cars to enhance their performance.
For 1959, Ballamy developed two ladder chassis which used a semi-swing axle front suspension featuring Citroën 2CV-style leading arms. At the rear was a transverse double cantilever layout. The ‘A’ model chassis suited Ford side valve engines while the ‘B’ model was for Ford overhead valve and BMC B-series motors. Various proprietary specials shells could be fitted. Only two of these chassis are known to have survived.
In 1961, Ballamy came to an agreement with Edwards Brothers (EB) of Stoke to retail their Debonair body shell. Mated to his chassis, he sold the stylish coupe as the LMB Debonair. Fifty examples of the Debonair were completed and the chassis went on to form the basis for the Reliant Sabre, although mated to a modified Ashley 1172 shell.
Later years.
In April 1962, Ballamy retired from the automotive industry. He died in Guildford in 1991.

Magno Vieira

Magno Silva Vieira (born 13 February 1985) is a former Brazilian footballer who was most recently manager of Central Premier League club North Wellington. Having started his career with Wigan Athletic, he has represented the likes of Barnet, Wycombe Wanderers, Fleetwood Town and Forest Green Rovers.
Career.
Born in Brasília, Distrito Federal, Vieira started his career in England with Wigan Athletic in 2003 but failed to get into the first team and went out on loan to Northampton Town and Carlisle United. While on loan to Carlisle, Vieira became a cult figure when he scored some important goals, most notably when he scored a hat-trick away at Aldershot Town in a 5–0 win.
He left Wigan in 2005 and was to join Carlisle permanently, after playing an important part in their return to The Football League, but passport problems prevented him playing.
Following a year out of football, Vieira in 2006 signed for Barnet. He spent one year at Underhill, being released in May 2007.
After his release by Barnet, Vieira signed for Crawley Town in June, becoming one of Steve Evans' first signings for the club.
On 6 March 2008, Vieira was allowed to join Cambridge United on loan for the remainder of the 2007–08 season.

In his first season there he helped the club reach the play-offs and was their highest goalscorer with 22 league goals while in his second season at the club Vieira helped Fleetwood to promotion to the Football League as Conference champions.
In late April 2012, it was confirmed that Vieira had entered into talks with Forest Green Rovers ahead of a potential move to the Conference club. It was confirmed he had joined the club in early May on a free transfer, signing a three-year contract.
On 11 August 2012, Vieira made his debut for Forest Green in a 1–1 draw against his former club Cambridge United. He scored his first goal for Forest Green on 25 August 2012 in a 3–1 home win against Woking. On 1 August 2014, he joined Forest Green's division rivals Nuneaton Town on a one-month loan deal after falling down the pecking order at The New Lawn.

Ernulf Academy

Ernulf Academy is a secondary school with academy status, located in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, England. It is one of two St Neots secondary schools that are part of the Astrea Academy Trust, with Longsands Academy being the other.
About.
When Ernulf Academy was first opened, it was originally named 'Ernulf Community School', but was later changed to 'Ernulf Community College'. In 2004, the school gained Specialist School status, and changed its name again to 'St. Neots Community College'. Then, on 1 September, the college relaunched with its new name. Its specialist subjects were Drama, Media, and Music, which together with Art, form the performing arts group. The school became Cambridgeshire's first 11–18 Specialist Performing Arts College. In May 2009, the school was put under special measures, but as of March 2011 they were classed by Ofsted as a "satisfactory school with good and outstanding features". The school was partnered with Longsands Academy as part of the 'St Neots Learning Partnership', and following a consultation, the school became an academy from 1 September 2011 and was renamed Ernulf Academy.
Sixth Form.
In June 2015, Ernulf Academy announced that it would be temporarily closing its Sixth Form at the end of the school year. In September, a combined St Neots Sixth Form Centre, for both Ernulf and Longsands students, was opened in place of the Longsands Sixth Form building. In September 2018, the St Neots Sixth Form Centre was renamed Astrea Sixth Form St Neots after the St Neots Learning Partnership was merged with Astrea Academy Trust.

List of record home attendances of English football clubs

This is a list of record home attendances of English football clubs. It lists the highest attendance of all English non-League, English Football League and Premier League clubs, for a home match above a highest attendance of 5,000. It is noticeable that a large proportion of records were set at matches in the FA Cup.
Ground capacities have declined for many clubs since all-seater stadia were introduced in the late 1980s, especially at older grounds, with many records set at the terraced stadia, with their high standing capacities, that were replaced. In several cases records were achieved at a former ground rather than the club's current location. For example, Wigan Athletic's record was set at Springfield Park, not their current home, the DW Stadium.
The record home attendance for five clubs occurred away from their usual home grounds. Manchester United's record home attendance was set at Maine Road, the home of neighbours Manchester City, during a period when United's Old Trafford was being rebuilt following bomb damage sustained during the Second World War. During the 1998–99 season Arsenal played their UEFA Champions League home matches at Wembley, with the 73,707 attendance against Lens exceeding the record for Highbury and Tottenham Hotspur also played their UEFA Champions League games at Wembley Stadium in the 2016–17 season. Similarly, Accrington Stanley's record home attendance was set when the club played an FA Cup home tie at Blackburn's Ewood Park instead of their usual home (the Crown Ground) and Stevenage's record was set when the club played a "home" FA Cup tie against Birmingham City at Birmingham's St Andrew's ground.

Private Opera

The Private Opera (), also known as: 
was a private operatic enterprise, a company established in 1885 by Russian industrialist and philanthropist Savva Mamontov, who staged the operas, conducted the orchestra, trained the actors, taught them singing and paid all the expenses.
The company.
At first the company was organised in Abramtsevo Estate located north of Moscow. 
Later years.
In Moscow the opera was located in the house at the Bolshaya Dmitrovskaya street, known as "Solodovnikov Theatre", built in 1894–1895 by Russiant merchant and music lover Gavrila Solodovnikov (1826–1901). Later the house was burned down and the Private Opera moved into the theatre "Paradis" («Парадиз»), at 19/13, Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street (present-day Mayakovsky Theater).
The repertoire included many operas by foreign composers as well as the following works by Russian composers:
Final years.
In late 1890s, Mamontov consolidated a large lot of land in central Moscow, across from Theatre Square, for building a large civic center with his opera hall and a luxury hotel. He appointed William Walcot as lead architect, however, in 1899 Mamontov was unjustly arrested and put on trial for embezzlement connected with building of the Yaroslavl railway. The project, known as Hotel Metropol, was completed without theater by Petersburg Insurance Company.
Meanwhile, from 1899 until 1904 the company existed without Mamontov, and changed its name to "Private Opera Society" (Tovarishchestvo chastnoi opery).

NTEN

NTEN is an international nonprofit organization based in the United States. Founded in 2000, NTEN offers training and certificate programs for nonprofit staff learning about the equitable use of technology. Their CEO Amy Sample Ward was on the NonProfit Times Top 50 Influencers list every year from 2015 through 2020. The organization was named "the best small non-profit to work for" in Oregon by the magazine "Oregon Business" in 2019.
Overview.
NTEN was originally incorporated as The Nonprofit Technology Enterprise Network and is now known solely as NTEN. Described in the "Nonprofit Quarterly" as "One of the more recent and potentially powerful networks evolving in the nonprofit technology-assistance scene", the association provides forums for people involved in nonprofit technology, acts as a conduit for connecting journalists and researchers with nonprofit technology practitioners, makes technology information and resources available to organizations, and undertakes research for the sector. It runs the annual Nonprofit Technology Conference (NTC) in the USA as well as co-hosting other events. In 2012, the company created Tech Accelerate, a tool for making assessment about technology use and policies designed for nonprofit staff to assist them with decisions, planning, and investments.
Research and publications.
NTEN publishes research reports about issues affecting nonprofits. In 2017 they published their tenth annual "Nonprofit Technology Staffing and Investments Report" looking at where nonprofits spend their IT money, determining that they were spending more money on software than hardware and that over half provided funding for technology-specific training. In 2018 NTEN surveyed 250 nonprofits and published a report, "State of Nonprofit Cybersecurity", concluding that while many organizations maintain adequate data backups, many have no policies on cyberattacks, and "only 40 percent said they provide regular cybersecurity training for staff." Other publications include:
Digital Inclusion.
In 2015 NTEN partnered with Google Fiber to create a Digital Inclusion Fellowship program sponsoring 68 fellows across the US working with local organizations to assist in launching or expanding digital literacy programs. In 2019 the company began requiring salary information in postings on its job board citing equity reasons.
In 2020 the organization pulled their advertising from Facebook in response to their content moderation and data privacy policies. In January 2021, NTEN supported the impeachment and removal of President Trump. In October 2022, citing an increase in hate speech, the company stopped buying ads and sharply reduced its use of the Twitter platform.

Hessenford

Hessenford () is a small village in south-east Cornwall, United Kingdom, four miles west of St Germans on the A387 Polbathic to Polperro road. The village had a population of 170 at the 2001 census. It is in the civil parish of Deviock. The river Seaton runs through the village and a mill was recorded here in 1286; the last mill closing in the mid-20th century.
Hessenford is part of the united parishes of St Germans, Hessenford, Downderry and Tideford. St Anne's Church was built in 1832 as a chapel of ease in the parish of St Germans to serve the growing population of the village. It was built by local subscription, local labour and materials, and was dedicated on 26 September 1833, the perpetual curate being appointed by the vicar of Saint Germans. Hessenford became a parish in its own right by "Order in Council" in 1852 and in 1855 and 1871 the church was rebuilt in early English style. The lychgates, a gift, were built in 1905, the original gates being used for the entrance to the church yard.
A station was to be built at Hessenford as part of the proposed St Germans &amp; Looe Railway in the late 1930s, but the railway was abandoned without the station having been built.
The Seaton Valley Countryside Park is to the south of the village following the river valley to the coast at Seaton.

Breno, Ticino

Breno is a village and former municipality in the canton of Ticino, Switzerland.
In 2005 the municipality was merged with the other, neighboring municipalities Arosio, Fescoggia, Mugena and Vezio to form a new and larger municipality Alto Malcantone.
History.
Breno is first mentioned in 1140 as "Breno".
Archaeological digs have uncovered items from the Roman era in Breno. The village name is Celtic in origin, though the exact meaning is unknown. At some time after the year 1000, the Abbey of S. Abbondio in Como acquired some rights and land in Breno. The municipality bought itself out from under those rights in 1579. Modernly, the village includes the south land that once belonged to the municipality of Tortoglio. This land was abandoned in the wake of a plague in the 15th Century. The village was involved in a land dispute with Miglieglia until 1890.
The parish was established as Fescoggia parish in 1592. The Parish Church of S. Lorenzo was built in 1233, rebuilt in 1596 and expanded in 1852.
The local economy included both agriculture and herding in alpine pastures. "Alp Rettaiola" (alpine pasture) was lost after a century-long dispute with the Italian Valle Veddasca, following a by a decision of the Varese Congress in 1752. In the upper Malcantone Valley many of the farmers own land both in the Valley and in the lower, hilly area between Neggio and Bosco Luganese. Before winter sets in, they move their animals down into the hills to their winter pastures. The seasonal migration began in the 16th century and was very common until the beginning of the 19th century. Between 16th and 19th centuries, limited land and resources led to a large exodus of construction workers from Breno. A strong philanthropic attitude and community life, often supported by grants from wealthy villagers who had emigrated, allowed the village to build a number of institutions in the 19th century. The most important is the school of drawing from 1883. By the end of the 20th century, many of the workers in Breno commuted to Lugano for work.

Mugena is a village and former municipality in the canton of Ticino, Switzerland.
In 2005 the municipality was merged with the other, neighboring municipalities Arosio, Breno, Fescoggia and Vezio to form a new and larger municipality Alto Malcantone.
History.
Mugena is first mentioned in 1214 as "Megiadina". In 1270 it was mentioned as "Migena".
A random discovery led to the excavation of a Roman cremation cemetery. In the Middle Ages, Como Cathedral possessed property, tithes and rights to use alpine meadows over half of Nisciora Alp. Some documents mention a castrum, probably a supply camp, but his determination remains controversial. In the 13th century, Mugena belonged to the "Valle d'Arosio" (upper Magliasina Valley), an economic and administrative unit, which included Arosio, Breno, Cademario, Mugena, Tortoglio and Vezio.
The parish church of S. Agata is first mentioned in 1361. In 1636 it was, after Mugena separated from Breno, promoted to a vice parish. The church was renovated and toward the end of the 17th century, completely rebuilt. The current church features valuable stucco work from the 18th century.
The village has retained its rural appearance. Historically, farming and grazing in the alpine meadows of S. Maria and Cervello were the main source of income. At the beginning of the 21st century, most residents in the valley work in Lugano.

<doc id="6992817" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6992817" title="VCON">
VCON

VCON is a fan run fantasy, gaming, and science fiction convention held annually in the metro Vancouver area of British Columbia, Canada. It has been hosted by the West Coast Speculative Fiction Association (WCSFA) since 1993, and by the Western Canadian Science Fiction Convention Committee Association (WCSFCCA) before that.
History.
VCON is the oldest fan run science fiction convention across Canada and in the Pacific Northwest, spawning other fan run conventions in these regions (especially the Pacific Northwest) including Norwescon, OryCon, Con-Version and KeyCon. The first "VCON" (which was actually called the Vancouver SF Convention) was held April 9 and 10, 1971 at the Hotel Georgia in Vancouver with Ursula K. Le Guin as Guest of Honour. Its sponsoring organisations included the University of British Columbia Science Fiction Society (UBC SFFEN), the B.C. Science Fiction Association (an offshoot of the UBC club) and the Simon Fraser University Science Fiction Society (SF3).
Although 2011 was the 40th anniversary of the first VCON event, the event held in that year was VCON 37. This oddity in numbering occurred as a result of two things:
VCON has hosted Canvention, Canada's national science fiction convention several times: VCON 14/Canvention 6 in 1986, VCON 26/Canvention 21 in 2001, VCON 32/Canvention 27 in 2007, and VCON 39/Canvention 34 in 2014. VCON has also hosted two Westercon, the travelling science fiction convention for Western North America, with Westercon 30/VCON 7 in 1977 and Westercon 44/VCON 19 in 1991.
Schedule.
VCON is held on the Canadian Thanksgiving long weekend (the observed Canadian Thanksgiving holiday is always the second Monday in October). The registration desk and the member hospitality room opens at noon on Friday, with programming starting in the mid-afternoon, and the event continues until early Sunday evening.
Features.
Highlights include discussion panels, an art show, dealers’ tables, authors’ readings, game room, book launches, workshops, crafts, and a costume contest. 
VCON features a large art show, with original 2-D and 3-D work and prints by both professional and fan artists, as well as workshops and demonstrations by featured artists. Since the 1990s, there have also been two or more rooms devoted to tabletop and console (video) gaming.
The VCON spoof award, the Elron, is presented and selected passages of science fiction are publicly read. R. Graeme Cameron, president of the British Columbia Science Fiction Association (BCSFA), has stated that the name "Elron" is not an allusion to science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. The awards are reported each year in the BCSFA's science fiction fanzine "BCSFAzine".
During the Turkey Readings, panelists read selections from the worst published science fiction and fantasy fiction. Volunteers act out the story being read, and artists make a poster. Audience members can bid to make the reading stop or bid higher for the reading to continue. Funds raised go to CUFF, the Canadian Unity Fan Fund.
VCON has hosted the Aurora Awards ceremony six times, most recently in 2018.
VCON has a hospitality bar, room parties, and a Dead Dog party to celebrate the end of the convention.

As a diplomat, he filled various posts in US diplomatic service in China, helping in the negotiations of two treaties between the United States and China. He was the author of "The Real Chinaman" (1895) and "The Real Chinese Question" (1900), which attempted to expose myths concerning China, Chinese culture, and the issue of Chinese immigration to the United States. In September, 1906, he published "The Missionary Enterprise," in The Atlantic Monthly, a defense from the accusations following the Boxer Uprising.

Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters

Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters (CHKD), located in Norfolk, Virginia, United States, is the only freestanding children's hospital in Virginia. The hospital treats infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21 and even some adults who require pediatric care.
CHKD is a 206-bed hospital and serves the medical and surgical needs of children throughout the greater Hampton Roads metro area, the Eastern Shore of Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. It is also part of CHKD Health System, offering a network of comprehensive pediatric services in more than 40 locations that stretch from Williamsburg, VA, to Elizabeth City, NC.
On the outpatient side, CHKD offers primary care, diagnostic services, urgent care, emergency care, rehabilitative therapies, day surgery and care in more than 20 pediatric subspecialties.
History.
In 1896, a group of Christian women formed the Norfolk City Union of The King's Daughters to provide medical care for indigent mothers and their children. They established a free clinic and visiting nurse service and in 1961 built The King's Daughters' Children's Hospital, with 88 beds and a variety of services. In 1979, the name was changed to Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters.
In the 1980s, CHKD surgeon Donald Nuss developed a procedure to correct pectus excavatum, and CHKD remains a leading center for the Nuss procedure.
The CHKD hospital campus sits in southwest Norfolk, adjacent to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital and Eastern Virginia Medical School. CHKD serves as the main pediatric training location for EVMS students, and along with EVMS, sponsors an ACGME-accredited pediatric residency training program.
Today, the CHKD Health System operates primary care pediatric practices, surgical practices, urgent care centers, multi-service Health Centers and satellite offices throughout its service region. It also hosts the only donor human milk bank in Virginia.
In 2017 UVA Children's Hospital partnered with Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters to improve care for children throughout the region.
In 2018, CHKD earned a full Level I Pediatric Trauma Center status. "CHKD earned provisional status as a Level I Pediatric Trauma Center in September of 2017. In July 2018, a multidisciplinary Health Department team conducted a follow-up site visit to verify the hospital's adherence to Virginia trauma center standards. During the provisional period, CHKD's trauma team cared for almost 600 trauma patients. The follow-up site visit resulted in unanimous recommendation for approval from all reviewers."
In response to community assessment surveys that showed mental health services for children to be a top priority, the hospital began a multimillion-dollar initiative to expand mental health services for children. In 2019, the hospital system broke ground for a $224 million mental health facility that will have 60 inpatient beds, indoor and outdoor exercise areas, and rooms for outpatient services and a "partial hospitalization" program. The 14-story center will be on the same campus as the main hospital at 601 Children's Lane in Norfolk.

Video journalism

Video journalism or videojournalism is a form of journalism, where the journalist shoots, edits and often presents their own video material.
Background.
A predecessor to video journalism first appeared in the 1960s in the USA, when reporters had to write and shoot their own stories. Michael Rosenblum compared the introduction of video cameras to the invention of the portable camera in the 1930s: film spools of plastic made photography independent from heavy plates and tripods, and digital video technology liberates TV from heavy electronic news gathering (ENG) equipment, artificial light and television studios in much the same manner. Video journalism makes it possible for videographers to document any event while it is still occurring.
The concept of the Videojournalist using a small camera was invented by Michael Rosenblum in 1988. The first TV station in the world to use only VJs was TV Bergen, in Bergen, Norway. Rosenblum later built VJ-only TV stations for TV 3 Norway, TV3 Sweden and TV3 Denmark. Around the same time, CITY-TV in Toronto also began to adapt the ideas for their "CityPulse" newscast and other shows produced at the station, becoming a staple; similar principles were adopted by Citytv head Moses Znaimer at other CHUM television stations and networks.
In the early 1990s, the news channel New York 1 was the first TV station in the US to hire only video journalists and have them trained by Rosenblum. In the mid-1990s, the first German private stations followed the example of NY1, and in 1994, the regional channel Bayerischer Rundfunk became the first public broadcasting station to follow suit and hire a number of video journalists.
In 2001 the BBC started to switch to video journalism in all its regional offices. As of June 2005 the BBC has more than 600 of its staff trained as video journalists. Other broadcasting entities who now use video journalism include Voice of America and Video News International. It also seems to be becoming more widespread among newspapers, with the New York Times alone employing twelve video journalists.
The Press Association (UK) is behind a training programme which "converts" regional journalists into video journalists, and more than 100 have been converted as of March 2007.
In Australia, several commercial networks employ Video Journalists. They include WIN News, Golden West Network (GWN) and Network Ten. Increasing popularity in online news has seen Video Journalists employed by Fairfax, News Limited and The West Australian Newspaper Holdings to produce video content for their news websites.
In Canada, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation made a widespread move into hiring video journalists (or retraining existing reporters or camera people to do multiple jobs) in the late 1990s. In most cases, they were assigned to local newsrooms to do daily news, just as full crews had before. Primarily, it was a cost-saving measure. Within a few years, however, it was clear that this rarely produced good results because of short deadlines and the assumption that VJ’s could work the same way and on the same stories. The effort was scaled back.
The exception turned out to be video journalists who work more as independent documentary film-makers, using their electronic field production (EFP) mobility and easier access to do stories that don’t have short deadlines. One example of this is award-winning video journalist Sasa Petricic, who works for CBC’s flagship daily newscast, The National, and reports solo from around the world. Tara Sutton another Canadian video journalist reported for multiple news outlets from Iraq and other conflicts and won many international awards. She has cited the unobtrusively small equipment of a video journalist as allowing her to move undercover more easily in the extreme danger of Iraq and access places where traditional news crews could not have gone without become targets.
The video journalist Kevin Sites is perhaps the best known having his own website Kevin Sites in the Hot Zone in which he spent a year going from one war to the next. He began as a traditional camera man but switched to video journalism.
The New York Times employs 12 video journalists who come mostly from television and documentary background. The Times' video unit regularly produces documentaries to go along with print pieces that run in the newspaper.
In 2012, former New York Times and Current TV video journalist, Jaron Gilinsky, founded Storyhunter, a network of 25,000 video journalists in 190 countries.
Pros and cons.
Growth in video journalism coincides with changes in video technology and falling costs. As quality cameras and non-linear editing system (NLE) have become smaller and available at a fraction of their previous prices, the single camera operator method has spread.
Some argue that video journalists can get closer to the story, avoiding the impersonality that may come with larger television crewing. In addition, the dramatically lower costs have made possible the birth of many cinéma vérité-style documentary films and television series. Others see this method of production as a dilution of skills and quality driven by television network management cost cutting incentives.
There is a move toward finding independent distribution for freelance video journalists. One of the issues is copyright, which can be difficult to obtain when broadcasters and agencies insist on full ownership of the footage. The other difficulty can be trying to find distribution beyond established contacts. Increasingly, online companies are giving VJs the opportunity to keep ownership of their stories and find global distribution.

William Wasbrough Foster

Major-General William Wasbrough Foster, CMG, DSO, VD (1 October 1875 – 2 December 1954) was a noted mountaineer, Conservative Party politician, businessman, and chief constable in British Columbia, Canada, in addition to his distinguished military career. Foster was elected to the BC Legislature in a 1913 byelection. He was defeated for re-election in the 1916, 1924, and 1933 provincial elections.
Early life.
Known as Billy to friends and family, Foster was born in Bristol, England. He studied engineering at Wycliffe College before he emigrated to British Columbia in 1894, where he became involved in the lucrative lumber business. He served with the Canadian Pacific Railway as a superintendent and police magistrate in Revelstoke, manager for the Globe Lumber Company on Vancouver Island, President of the Conservative Party of British Columbia, provincial Member of the Legislative Assembly, and Minister of Public Works prior to the Great War. Foster was an avid mountaineer and was on the first expeditions to climb Mount Robson and Canada's highest peak, Mount Logan.
Foster served as the president of the Alpine Club of Canada and has a mountain on Vancouver Island named in his honour, Mount Colonel Foster, as well as Foster Peak in the Canadian Rockies. He was also an honorary initiate of the BC Alpha chapter of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity at the University of British Columbia.
In World War I, he fought in the Somme and Vimy Ridge battles and reached the rank of lieutenant colonel and was awarded the DSO. He was twice wounded and mentioned in dispatches five times.
Industrial relations.
Foster worked as the managing director of Evans, Coleman and Evans, a timber exporting company on Vancouver's waterfront after the war that was a constituent member of the Shipping Federation of British Columbia, established by railway, stevedoring, and storage companies to manage commercial operations on the Port of Vancouver.
In 1923, Foster headed the Shipping Federation's protection committee, and organised a group of 144 special constables, who were sworn in and given badges and guns by the Vancouver Police Department. Their job was to protect over 1000 strikebreakers, composed mainly of high school and University of British Columbia students, to break a longshoremen's strike and crush the Vancouver local of the International Longshoremen's Association.
The strike and the union were broken, and the longshoremen were organised into a new company union, the Vancouver and District Waterfront Workers' Association. Within a decade, however, communist organisers would transform the union into a militant union, which again would come into conflict with Colonel Foster.
Chief constable.
Foster probably gained his greatest local notoriety in Vancouver when he was appointed chief constable of the Vancouver Police Department on 3 January 1935. He came in during a shake-up and purge of the police to prepare the civic government forces for a showdown with the local communist movement. The Communist Party of Canada's trade union umbrella, the Workers' Unity League, was planning a general strike for May 1935, and the local big business interests claimed that it was to be the beginning of a Bolshevik revolution in Canada.
The general strike and revolution never happened, but the city was flooded in the spring of 1935 with striking relief camp workers, which metamorphosed into the On-to-Ottawa Trek that left Vancouver atop boxcars in early June. Foster restructured the police department significantly, and led an effort to eradicate crime and vice from the city. He initiated the first training of Vancouver police officers, updated police uniforms, added tear gas to the police arsenal, and established a "Communist Activities Branch" to gather intelligence.
On one occasion, he used his influence to have a bylaw passed banning white women from working in Chinatown restaurants on the assumption that they were being lured into prostitution, or "white slavery" as it was known at the time, with Chinese clients. The move sparked a backlash from Chinese businessmen and from women who had lost their jobs from restaurants, which had their business licences revoked. Business licences were restored only when the owners agreed not longer employ white women any longer, and at least thirty women were forced to seek other employment.
Battle of Ballantyne Pier.
Foster had somewhat of a showdown with communism during the Battle of Ballantyne Pier on 18 June 1935 when a group of about 1000 longshoremen and supporters marched behind a contingent of war veterans carrying the Union Jack headed towards the waterfront, where strikebreakers were unloading ships. Foster and contingents from the city, provincial, and federal police forces drove the protesters back with truncheons and tear gas. Protestors fought back, and for three hours, police and demonstrators clashed in the streets of Vancouver's East End. One youth was shot in the back of his legs by a police shot gun, and many protesters and police required hospital treatment after the riot.
Later life.
Foster remained active in veteran affairs during peacetime and was the president of the Royal Canadian Legion from 1938 to 1940. His career as chief constable was cut short when he was called off to war in 1939. During the Second World War, he was promoted to major general.
In April 1943, Foster was enlisted by Prime Minister Mackenzie King to serve as Commissioner of Defense Projects in Canada's northwest. King described him in his diary as "A very fine fellow with lots of tact. I think he will be an ideal man for the position; also an ex-President of the war veterans. He has knowledge and carries with him authority and has fine organizing ability."
Canada was then co-operating with the United States on infrastructure projects in the Northwest that would have implications on postwar bilateral relations. Foster's role was to make sure "that no commitments are made and no situation allowed to develop as a result of which the full Canadian control of the area would be in any way prejudiced or endangered."
After the war, Foster was appointed the head of BC Hydro, where he again attempted to fight off the forces of unionisation.

Plot.
The film follows two con artist brothers, Yipao / Little John (Yuen Biao) and Taipao / Big John (Bryan Leung). One day they are cheated out of their ill-gotten gains in an encounter with Jia Wu Dao / Silver Fox (Lau Kar Wing). They try to fight him, to retrieve their money, but are defeated, so they ask him to train them, hoping to become the best fighters in the city. After surpassing the fighting skills of "ordinary people", Yipao soon discovers that Jia Wu Dao is a murderer. When he realises his secret has been revealed, Jia Wu Dao attempts to kill Yipao, but Taipao blocks the fatal blow and is killed in his place.
Yipao escapes and plots how he will avenge his brother's death. He encounters a fat beggar (Sammo Hung) and, impressed by his kung fu, he asks the beggar to become his new kung fu master. After extensive training, the beggar asks Yipao to go and get him some wine. As he is about to return with the wine, Yipao encounters Jia Wu Dao again, and they fight, but Yipao's skill is insufficient. The fat beggar and Yipao then team up, using the monkey style kung fu, against Jia Wu Dao's snake style. As their fight moves outside of the wine shop, the fat beggar and Yipao defeat Jia Wu Dao, killing him with spiked vines, finally avenging Taipao's death. The fat beggar reveals that he is an undercover detective trying to arrest criminals, particularly Jia Wu Dao.

Jaime Zobel de Ayala

Jaime Zóbel de Ayala y Pfitz (born July 18, 1934), also known as Jaime Zóbel, is a Filipino businessman who served as the chairman of the Ayala Corporation from 1984 to 2006 and as its president from 1984 to 1994. Presently, he holds the honorary title as "Chairman Emeritus". 
Zóbel served as the Ambassador of the Republic of the Philippines to the United Kingdom from 1970 to 1975. He is also known as a noted art photographer being the first Filipino photographer to be given a Licentiate by the Royal Photographic Society of the United Kingdom.
Zóbel and his wife Beatriz were noted to be among the most fervent anti-Marcos personalities leading up to the 1986 presidential election, with the two actively participating in the People Power Revolution that overthrew the Marcos family in late February 1986.
Early life and family.
Zóbel was born on July 18, 1934 to Alfonso Zóbel de Ayala (1904–1967) and Carmen Pfitz y Herrero (1909–1999). His siblings are Maria Victoria ("Vicky") and Alfonso Jr. ("Alfonsito"). He is a grandson of Enrique Zóbel de Ayala and Consuelo de Ayala.
He is the widower of Beatriz Miranda. Together they have two sons (Jaime Augusto and Fernando) and five daughters (Beatriz Susana ["Bea Jr."], Patricia, Cristina, Monica, and Sofía).
Education.
After early education in the Philippines, Zóbel attended Harvard University, where he graduated in 1957 with a bachelor's degree in architectural sciences. He attended the six-week Advanced Management Program in the Far East, conducted by faculty from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in Baguio, the Philippines in 1963.
Career.
Ayala Corporation.
Zóbel joined Ayala y Compañía in 1958 as executive assistant upon the invitation of his father. His father placed him under the wing of his cousin Enrique and uncle Col. Joseph McMicking. As an executive assistant in the company, he took down notes during management meetings and gradually learned the ropes of the family business. He was later transferred to the training section of the insurance companies of the Ayala group. In 1975, he became president of "Filipinas Life Assurance Company" (now, "BPI AIA Life Assurance Corporation").
In 1984, he succeeded Enrique, as chairman and president of Ayala Corporation (AC). Zóbel successfully steered Ayala through the tense, final years of the Marcos dictatorship. The assassination of Ninoy Aquino in 1983 was later cited by Zóbel to have pushed him and his wife Bea into active participation in the opposition movement against President Ferdinand Marcos, with Zóbel stating that "Ayala has always been apolitical but this was a time that you knew that you had to be political, there was no other way."
In the lead-up to the February 1986 presidential election, the Ayala couple were among the most fervent supporters of presidential candidate Corazon Aquino, widow of Ninoy Aquino. Two weeks after the election, the People Power Revolution against President Marcos occurred, wherein the Ayalas were active participants, and upon the overthrow of the Marcos family and the installation of Corazon Aquino's new administration, Bea "helped put things in order" at the Malacañang Palace. Jaime Zóbel's photographs of people at the revolution were later compiled into a book entitled "Filipino", published in March 1987 by Kyodo Press.
In 1988, the real estate division was spun off as Ayala Land, Inc. AC also ventured into new businesses, like automotive (Ayala Automotive Holdings Corporation).
Zóbel stepped down as president of AC in 1994 and was succeeded by his son, Jaime Augusto. He continued as chairman until his retirement in 2006 and then became its chairman emeritus.
Photography.
Zóbel joined the Camera Club of the Philippines in the mid-1970s and began taking photography more seriously. He is the first Filipino amateur photographer to be confirmed “Licentiate” by the Royal Photographic Society of the United Kingdom, and has received similar commendations from the French and Spanish governments for his contributions to art and culture. He exhibits regularly in the Philippines and abroad, and has produced several critically acclaimed books. He continues to break new ground in art photography with explorations in various art media.
Diplomat.
Between 1970 and 1975, Zóbel was appointed as the Philippine Ambassador to the Court of St. James's in London, representing the United Kingdom and ambassador of Scandinavian countries.

The Prix Jean Romanet was established in 2004, and it initially held Group 2 status. It was one of several new races designed to keep more fillies from being exported or prematurely retired to stud.
The race was promoted to Group 1 level in 2009.

Silvermine, Connecticut

Silvermine is an unincorporated community in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States that extends along the Silvermine River, across three southwestern Connecticut towns: Norwalk, New Canaan and Wilton.
The name "Silvermine" comes from old legends of a silver mine in the area, although no silver has ever been found. Silvermine, the nearest (50 miles) to New York City of the larger art colonies,&lt;ref name="SilvermineCT/Map"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; remains the home of the Silvermine Guild Arts Center. The Silvermine Tavern, an inn occupying several historic buildings, also remains in the neighborhood. Silver Hill Hospital is just beyond the northern end of the neighborhood, in New Canaan near the Wilton border. There are two Silvermine community groups: The "Silvermine Community Association" and the "Norwalk Association of Silvermine Homeowners".
Settlement.
Silvermine, once called Silver Mine, may have been well-settled by the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="norwalkCT/Silvermine"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century, the Silvermine River was used for 12 or 13 mills in the neighborhood because it fell steeply enough for the water power to be profitably harnessed. The mills included a leather tanning works, sawmill, and spool works. First built in 1688 on the Silvermine River in Silvermine, Connecticut, the Buttery Sawmill burned down and was rebuilt in 1741.&lt;ref name="CTc+g/BS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Perry Avenue Bridge.
In 1899, the present Perry Avenue Bridge was constructed. The one-lane stone bridge carries the road over Silvermine River near the Silvermine Tavern grist mill. In the flood of 1955, water flowed over the bridge. The span was put on the National Register of Historic Places in October 2006. That year one of the bridge's curbstones fell into the water, and for the six months before Memorial Day weekend in 2008 the span was closed as repairs were made. The bridge is so narrow that when at times when cars try to pass another, curbstones can be hit. The Norwalk city government spent $350,000 in repairs, which included masonry restoration, new railings, repaving and further narrowing so that drivers would not be tempted to try to pass. A parade with antique cars was held to celebrate the reopening of the bridge.
Silvermine Art Guild.
In 1906, Solon Hannibal Borglum, a sculptor, moved to the New Canaan part of Silvermine and built a hillside studio. He was one of the leading figures in an emerging community of artists in the neighborhood and helped found the "Knockers Club", so named because when they would meet in Borglum's studio and discuss their art, a lot of frank criticism came out, knocking one another's work, they soon were known as "The Silvermine Group of Artists".
In 1911, Frank Townsend Hutchens purchased "The Old Mill House", "The Guthrie-Hutchens Barn", "The Blacksmith/Basket Shop", the "White Mill" (later called the original "Village Room"), and "The Red Mill" (Guthrie Knob Mill).
John Kenneth Byard, the husband of the artist Dorothy Randolph Byard, and a major antique dealer and expert on Colonial-era furniture, purchased 83 (to over 100) acres in Norwalk, New Caanan and Wilton. He also was instrumental in selling and financing other properties in Silvermine.
The retail stores along Silvermine Avenue were: Frank Buttery's Country Department Store, the Hyatt-Gregory Store, a barber shop, Guthrie’s meat business (now the Silvermine Market), and Mrs. Loudon’s combined Post Office and grocery.
"However vague and undefined as a geographical locality the place called Silvermine, Connecticut may be, there is nothing undefined or vague about the Silvermine Group of Artists. This group is a very definite thing, simply organized, with its purpose clearly stated, holding weekly meetings, admitting to membership only professional artists, and requiring for admission of new members a unanimous vote, maintaining independence, needing no patronage nor asking any. Its weekly meetings held in the hilltop studio of Solon Borglum, the sculptor, are not for relaxation. On the contrary, the member who brings his work to these meetings, as all members are not privileged to do, knows that he is sure of frank and competent criticism, which while it may not augment self-esteem it is very likely to result in self-improvement…There is therefore no lack of good pictures for the jury to select from when the time comes for the annual exhibition."&lt;ref name="BASH/sga-1906"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Science Monitor, 4 September 1915
In 1918, after WW1, in New York City, Solon Borglum opened a studio and founded the School of American Sculpture, closing upon his death.&lt;ref name="SI/shB"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1922, after Borglum's appendicitis death,&lt;ref name="NASH/sga-1922"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the survivors founded the "Silvermine Guild", the country’s longest-operating guild, and one of the largest and oldest art centers in New England. John Kenneth Byard purchased the original barn for the Silvermine Guild of Artists, and had it moved to Silvermine Avenue, becoming the studio, exhibition and performance space for the next two decades.
In 1924, the incorporated "Silvermine Art Guild"/"Silvermine Guild of Artists" (by 2024, the "Silvermine Arts Center") founded the Silvermine College of Art.&lt;ref name="SAC/story"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Other artists in the group/neighborhood included: George Avison (writer, illustrator, landscape painter), Edmund Marion Ashe (1867-1941, a painter and an illustrator for New York-based newspapers), D. Putnam Brinley, William Boring (1859-1937, an architect and the Dean of Columbia School of Architecture), John Cassell, Richard Daggy, Johnny Gruelle (artist and creator of Raggedy Ann), Frank Townsend Hutchens (1869-1937, a portrait and landscape painter&lt;ref name="NASH/Byard&amp;Hutchens"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;), Henry Grinnell Thomson (1850-1937, a painter of detailed still lifes), Howard L. Hildebrandt (1872-1958, a nationally recognized portrait, flora and landscape painter), Cornelia Ellis Hildebrandt (1876-1962, an award-winning miniaturist), Adele Klaer, E. Murray MacKay, Augustus Daggy, Clifton Meek, Addison Thomas Millar (1860-1913, Orientalist painter from Warren, Ohio), Sam Otis and Carl Schmitt.&lt;ref name="A&amp;A/founders"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Later members included D. Putnam Brinley (1879-1963, an impressionist and post-impressionist painter, muralist and early modernist), Hamilton Hamilton (1847-1928 a portrait and landscape artist), Leo Francis Dorn (1879-1964, commercial illustrator), and Frederick Coffay Yohn (1875-1933, commercial illustrator), Richard Buckner Gruelle (1851-1914), a tonalist landscape artist, father of Johnny Gruelle), Bernard Gutmann (1869-1936, impressionist and post-impressionist painter, printmaker and illustrator), Karl James Anderson (artist) (1874-1956), Helen Hamilton (1889-1970), and Charles Reiffel (1862-1942).
During the Second World War, most of the Guild properties were taken over by Civil Defense and the local chapter of the American Red Cross, the Barn was used for classroom space for returning war veterans. From 1943 to the end of the war, artists were paid for their work in war bonds at the Guild's Annual War Bond Exhibition.&lt;ref name="NASH/sag-1943"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1955, heavy rains caused the flooding of the Silvermine River, mostly destroying the Buttery Mill, with a section of the building used in a new secondary building, but it was never again used as a mill, ending its longest continuous usage as a mill in the history of the United States. Margaret Bourke White took photographs of the 1955 flood for Life Magazine.&lt;ref name="NASH/sag-1955"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1959, Spain Rodriguez left the "Silvermine College of Art".&lt;ref name="hA/msr-Sexist"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting in 1962, for ten years, the Silvermine Art Guild operated the Silvermine College of Art as an accredited two-year educational institution.
Silvermine Tavern.
In 1929, John Kenneth Byard started running the Silvermine Tavern, a tavern, restaurant and inn with 11 overnight rooms. The group of four historic buildings overlooking the mill falls on the Silvermine River consists of the grist mill building, the oldest, constructed in the seventeenth century, the tavern building, the coach house and the country store.
In the 1930s, actor Spencer Tracy frequently stayed in Silvermine and purportedly "holds the record for eating the most waffles at one sitting" at the old Grist Mill, when that building was a waffle shop.
In 1948 the tavern changed hands and was run by I.M. Weiss until, in 1973, Frank and Marsha Whitman took over the tavern. In 2007 the Whitmans announced they were selling it, with an asking price of $4.5 million, notifying their patrons about the sale with letters to longtime, loyal customers in an attempt to find a buyer who valued the traditions of the local institution, although the marketing was also going beyond that group to restaurateurs in Fairfield County and New York City. The business had 35 employees.
The president of the Connecticut Restaurant Association said in early 2007 that the tavern is a venerable institution, with loyal patrons who would not want dramatic changes to it. Brian Griffin, vice president of the Greater Norwalk Chamber of Commerce, called the business "one of the true New England taverns that we have left in the area, and it's absolutely a part of the neighborhood."
Aside from being a restaurant, Silvermine Tavern was a popular place for weddings and wedding receptions, as well as other private functions. It was also well known in the community for their Sunday Brunch. In recent years the restaurant's honey buns were popular.
The Silvermine Tavern closed on February 22, 2009, and subsequently the property was placed on the market for sale. The business re-opened for inn customers in 2010, but the restaurant remained closed to the general public. In 2012, the entire property was again placed on the market for sale.
National Register of Historic Places listings.
In 2003, the "Norwalk Association of Silvermine Homeowners" began a campaign to get the neighborhood recognized on the National Register of Historic Places. For years, the association wanted the entire neighborhood designated, but because of newer construction, the original proposal was broken up into several smaller sections. The group raised $13,000 on its own and, on June 26, 2006, the State Historic Preservation Office granted $7,000 to study the "core" area of the neighborhood in order to draw up a proposal. State Sen. Bob Duff, a Norwalk Democrat, helped get increased state funding for the State Historic Preservation Office which gave out the grant to the community. Duff told a local newspaper that four generations of his family have lived in the neighborhood.
The core area consists of Silvermine Tavern and 85 other historic buildings, about half of which are in Norwalk, with the rest in New Canaan, except for one in Wilton. The core area was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district, known as Silvermine Center Historic District, on June 23, 2009. NASH has initiated the development of applications for two additional possible historic districts, the Silvermine Avenue Historic District and the Perry Avenue Historic District.
The Perry Avenue Bridge in the neighborhood, built in 1899, was separately nominated for the National Register in mid-2006 and was listed on October 25, 2006.
Neighborhoods.
According to the "Silvermine Community Association", the northern boundary of the neighborhood is Huckleberry Hill Road in both Wilton and New Canaan. The neighborhood includes both sides of Thayer Drive and Wardwell Drive in New Canaan, Silvermine Road and the streets off it, east of the intersection with Carter Street and Canoe Hill Road. Carter Street is not in the neighborhood, but all of the streets east of it are.
In Norwalk, the neighborhood includes a bit of New Canaan Avenue near the New Canaan line and Purdy Road, Comstock Hill Avenue and streets off it, Silvermine Avenue just north of its intersection with Bartlett Avenue, Cliffview Drive, James Street and Riverview Drive, Perry Avenue north and west of Route 7 and North Seir Hill Road, south of its intersection with Vespucci Road, which is also in the neighborhood.
In Wilton, the neighborhood includes both sides of Seir Hill Road north to its intersection with Old Boston Road, the west side of Old Boston Road to its intersection with Highfield Road, both sides of Old Boston Road north of that to its intersection with New Canaan Road, the west side of Old Boston Road north of that to Huckleberry Hill Road, and the south side of Huckleberry Hill Road in Wilton and New Canaan.

Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo

"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo" is a grammatically correct sentence in English that is often presented as an example of how homonyms and homophones can be used to create complicated linguistic constructs through lexical ambiguity. It has been discussed in literature in various forms since 1967, when it appeared in Dmitri Borgmann's "".
The sentence employs three distinct meanings of the word "buffalo":
A semantically equivalent form preserving the original word order is: "Buffalonian bison whom other Buffalonian bison bully also bully Buffalonian bison."
Sentence construction.
The sentence is unpunctuated and uses three different readings of the word "buffalo". In order of their first use, these are:
The sentence is syntactically ambiguous; one possible parse (marking each "buffalo" with its part of speech as shown above) is as follows:
Buffaloa buffalon Buffaloa buffalon buffalov buffalov Buffaloa buffalon.
When grouped syntactically, this is equivalent to: [(Buffalonian bison) (Buffalonian bison intimidate)] intimidate (Buffalonian bison).
Because the sentence has a restrictive clause, there can be no commas. The relative pronouns "which" or "that" could appear between the second and third words of the sentence, as in "Buffalo buffalo that Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo"; when this pronoun is omitted, the relative clause becomes a reduced relative clause.
An expanded form of the sentence that preserves the original word order is:
"Buffalo bison that other Buffalo bison bully also bully Buffalo bison."
Thus, the parsed sentence claims that bison who "are intimidated or bullied by bison" do themselves "intimidate or bully bison" (at least in the city of Buffalo – implicitly, Buffalo, New York):
Usage.
Thomas Tymoczko has pointed out that there is nothing special about eight "buffalos"; any sentence consisting solely of the word "buffalo" repeated any number of times is grammatically correct. The shortest is "Buffalo!", which can be taken as a verbal imperative instruction to bully someone ("[You,] buffalo!") with the implied subject "you" removed, or, as a noun exclamation, expressing e.g. that a buffalo has been sighted, or as an adjectival exclamation, e.g. as a response to the question, "where are you from?" Tymoczko uses the sentence as an example illustrating rewrite rules in linguistics.
Origin.
The idea that one can construct a grammatically correct sentence consisting of nothing but repetitions of "buffalo" was independently discovered several times in the 20th century. The earliest known written example, "Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo", appears in the original manuscript for Dmitri Borgmann's 1965 book "Language on Vacation", though the chapter containing it was omitted from the published version. Borgmann recycled some of the material from this chapter, including the "buffalo" sentence, in his 1967 book, "". In 1972, William J. Rapaport, then a graduate student at Indiana University, came up with versions containing five and ten instances of "buffalo". He later used both versions in his teaching, and in 1992 posted them to the LINGUIST List. A sentence with eight consecutive buffalos is featured in Steven Pinker's 1994 book "The Language Instinct" as an example of a sentence that is "seemingly nonsensical" but grammatical. Pinker names his student, Ann Senghas, as the inventor of the sentence.
Neither Rapaport, Pinker, nor Senghas were initially aware of the earlier coinages. Pinker learned of Rapaport's earlier example only in 1994, and Rapaport was not informed of Borgmann's sentence until 2006.
Versions of this linguistic oddity can be constructed with other words which similarly simultaneously serve as collective noun, adjective, and verb, some of which need no capitalization (such as "police").

Quentin Meillassoux

Quentin Meillassoux (; ; born 26 October 1967) is a French philosopher. He teaches at the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne.
Biography.
Quentin Meillassoux is the son of the anthropologist Claude Meillassoux. He is a former student of the philosophers Bernard Bourgeois and Alain Badiou. He is married to the novelist and philosopher Gwenaëlle Aubry.
Philosophical work.
Meillassoux's first book is "After Finitude" ("Après la finitude", 2006). Alain Badiou, Meillassoux's former teacher, wrote the foreword"." Badiou describes the work as introducing a new possibility for philosophy which is different from Immanuel Kant's three alternatives of criticism, skepticism, and dogmatism. The book was translated into English by Ray Brassier. Meillassoux is associated with the speculative realism movement.
In this book, Meillassoux argues that post-Kantian philosophy is dominated by what he calls "correlationism", the theory that humans cannot exist without the world nor the world without humans. In Meillassoux's view, this theory allows philosophy to avoid the problem of how to describe the world as it really is independent of human knowledge. He terms this reality independent of human knowledge as the "ancestral" realm. Following the commitment to mathematics of his mentor Alain Badiou, Meillassoux claims that mathematics describes the primary qualities of things as opposed to their secondary qualities shown by perception.
Meillassoux argues that in place of the agnostic scepticism about the reality of cause and effect, there should be a radical certainty that there is no causality at all. Following the rejection of causality, Meillassoux says that it is absolutely necessary that the laws of nature be contingent. The world is a kind of hyper-chaos in which the principle of sufficient reason is not necessary although Meillassoux says that the principle of non-contradiction is necessary.
For these reasons, Meillassoux rejects Kant's Copernican Revolution in philosophy. Since Kant makes the world dependent on the conditions by which humans observe it, Meillassoux accuses Kant of a "Ptolemaic Counter-Revolution." Meillassoux clarified and revised some of the views published in "After Finitude" during his lectures at the Free University of Berlin in 2012.
Several of Meillassoux's articles have appeared in English via the British philosophical journal "Collapse", helping to spark interest in his work in the Anglophone world.
His unpublished dissertation "L'inexistence divine" (1997) is noted in "After Finitude" to be "forthcoming" in book form; as of 2021, it had not yet been published. In "Parrhesia", in 2016, an excerpt from Meillassoux's dissertation was translated by Nathan Brown, who noted in his introduction that "what is striking about the document... is the marked difference of its rhetorical strategies, its order of reasons, and its philosophical style" from "After Finitude", counter to the general view that the latter merely constituted "a partial précis" of "L'inexistence divine"; he notes further that the dissertation presents a "very different articulation of the Principle of Factiality" from that in "After Finitude".
While Nathan Brown's translation uses the French text of the 1997 dissertation, in 2011 Graham Harman used a 2003 revision to offer a partial translation of Meillassoux's ongoing work of expanding the dissertation into a book.
In September 2011, Meillassoux's book on Stéphane Mallarmé was published in France under the title "Le nombre et la sirène. Un déchiffrage du coup de dés de Mallarmé". In this second book, he offers a detailed reading of Mallarmé's famous poem "Un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard" ("A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance"), in which he finds a numerical code at work in the text.

Mabyn

Mabyn, also known as Mabena, Mabon, etc., was a medieval Cornish saint. According to local Cornish tradition she was one of the many children of Brychan, king of Brycheiniog in Wales in the 5th century. The village and civil parish of St Mabyn is named for her, and the local St Mabyn Parish Church is dedicated to her.
History.
The earliest known source to mention Mabyn is the 12th-century Cornish Latin "Life of Saint Nectan". She appears in the appended list of the various children of King Brychan of Brycheiniog, which includes Nectan himself and many other saints. Brychan and his saintly children appear earlier in Welsh sources and were known also in Ireland and Brittany, though none of these sources mention Mabyn. The fact that the "Life" includes Mabyn alongside several other saints with churches dedicated to them in the West Country suggests that St Mabyn Parish Church was already established when the list was written.
There are several later medieval references to Mabyn and her church, but they offer little information about her, and two sources even describe her as a man. Sabine Baring-Gould suggested that the true founder of St Mabyn's Church was actually the male Welsh saint Mabon, supposedly a brother of Saint Teilo and the founder of Llanvabon, and that the attribution to a female Mabyn came about after the true history had been lost. At any rate the associations of Mabyn with the family of Brychan as it appears in the "Life of Saint Nectan" proved quite strong in Cornish tradition, and apparently survived until at least the 16th century. Nicholas Roscarrock records hearing, from people alive at the time St Mabyn Church was rebuilt around 1500, that at that time a "song or hymn" to Mabyn was sung that corresponded strongly with the list in the "Life". He further records her feast day as 18 November.
Mabyn is depicted in a 1523 (or 1528) stained glass window in the local church in the nearby village of St Neot, which lies to the east of the village. The window portrays her wearing robes and a crown, carrying a book and a palm branch, a symbol of martyrdom. She is one of six local Cornish saints to appear in the north-aisle windows, while those of the south aisle were reserved for internationally renowned saints and subjects of a more didactic nature. Five of these six saints used to appear on windows donated by three single-sex associations: the wives of the western part of the parish, the "sisters" (probably unmarried women) and the young men. The wives were the donors of St Mabyn's window, which also features St Meubred of Cardinham.
A credence table which survives at St Mabyn may originally have been the panel of a tomb raised in Mabyn's honour. It is possible that all her sisters had tombs erected for them.

Leonora Duarte

Leonora Duarte (1610 – 1678?) was a Baroque Flemish composer and musician, born in Antwerp. She belonged to a wealthy Portuguese-Jewish family who were major patrons of the arts and music. She was baptized on 28 July 1610. Duarte composed seven sinfonias which are the only known pieces of music written for viol by a woman in the 17th century.
Life.
Family.
Leonora Duarte's paternal grandparents, Diego Duarte I (c. 1544-1626) and Leonora Rodrigues (c.1565-1632) originally lived in Lisbon, Portugal until they were forced to flee during the Portuguese Inquisition. They most likely arrived in Antwerp around the year 1571. Practicing judaism in Antwerp was illegal, so the family became "Conversos," meaning they outwardly acted as Catholics while secretly maintaining their Jewish faith and practices.
Leonora the first-born child of Gaspar Duarte (c.1584-1653) and Catharina Rodrigues (1584-1644), and she had three sisters and two brothers; Diego II (1612-1691), Catharina (1614-1678), Gaspar II (1616-c.1685), Francisca (1619-1678), and Isabella (1620-1685).
Gaspar I played the harpsichord and was musically trained (as was Catharina), although professionally he was a successful jewelry merchant who specialized in diamonds. Gaspar was also very close friends with renowned harpsichord makers, Ruckers and Couchet. The Duarte family residence at the Meir in Antwerp was a well-known center for music and the visual arts. The correspondence of Leonora’s father and her brother Diego with Constantijn Huygens shows that there were frequent contacts with the cultural élite of the Low Countries and England, including Huygens himself and his sons Constantijn and Christiaan, Dutch poet and artist Anna Roemers Visscher, and William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle. In 1644 Nicholas Lanier visited the family when he was in voluntary exile, and in 1653 Anne and Joseph de la Barre paid a visit when traveling from Paris to Stockholm.
In addition to his business in jewels, Gaspar and Diego were also heavily involved in the collection, trading, and commissioning of art. 
Growing up as "converso" in her family’s home, there seemed to be an interesting balance of Leonora's understanding her identity, both as a Jewish woman at core, but also as a Jewish woman composer during the Baroque period. On one hand, conversos were closely observed, while on the other hand, it seems her family, especially her father, made it be known that regardless of their practices, their family was successful and otherwise great patrons of the arts and culture.
Early life.
Duarte received a superb musical education that included instruction on viol, virginals, and lute, as well as lessons in composition. She was familiar with the music and styles of both English composers such as John Bull (1562/63-1628) and those from Continental Europe, as well as local Flemish music. Their family home was known for a remarkable appreciation for guests and personal musical performances by all members of their family.
The entirety of the Duarte family was trained in music, as evidenced by visitor Captain William Swann (1619-1678), who described his evening in the Duarte home, For Monsieur de Warty [sic] and his daughters I have heard to the fulle. Indeed they make a fyne consort and harmony for luts, viols, virginals and voyces. I doubt not but you will fynde great contentment by hearing them.The house was filled with a variety of high-quality musical instruments, including at least five harpsichords and virginals, as well as a claviorgan, a combination of a harpsichord and an organ. Leonora's brother brother Diego set to music various poems by William Cavendish (1650s) and later the psalm paraphrases of Godeau (1673–85), which he dedicated to Constantijn Huygens. None of these works, possibly all for one voice with basso continuo, has survived today.
Death.
It is unknown what month, or even year, of Leonora’s death but can be assumed around 1678. Leonora was one of three daughters of the Duarte family to die from Antwerp’s plagues. The year of her death is supported by city records of the event.
Her brother Diego died in 1691 without successors, which ended the Antwerp branch of the Duarte family.
Seven Sinfonias.
As a young composer, Leonora Duarte wrote a set of seven abstract fantasies, written for five viols. These seven short pieces are in the late Jacobean style and called ‘Symphonies’. Her father, Gaspar, likely wrote out the titles of each Sinfonia, yet we do not know who copied the music. Given the frequency with which women were tasked with music copying, it is possible that Leonora copied the works, herself.
Leonora was capable of combining her compositional skills with the latest ideas and theory in Italian and French music due to the rich traffic of visitors from all parts of Europe that regularly made it to the Duarte’s house on the Meir. Influences can be noted and applied, regarding the Duarte family and their guests, who at one time included Dirk Sweelinck, son of Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, the Dutch composer whose work helped mark the transition between the Renaissance and Baroque periods of music.
The music of the seven Sinfonias shows the clear intersection of different styles of European music. Sinfonias Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 7 are written in free counterpoint, while Nos. 4, 5, and 6 use source material. All seven are written for five parts, with two high treble voices, two middle voices, and a bass.
Sinfonia No. 4 resembles English fantasia writing, including the practice of composing over top of a cantus firmus.
Sinfonia No. 6 is a reworking of Girolamo Frescobaldi's (1583-1643) four-part Recercar Settimo from his "Recercari et canzoni Franzese" (1615). Duarte's reimagining preserves Frescobaldi's music with minimal changes, although she omits measures 35-mid 64, and adds the second treble part to make a fifth voice. 
Legacy.
Leonora Duarte was never commissioned by the church or the court over her lifetime, but stood out in her musical family due to her compositional talent. Her seven short sinfonias reflect the creation and compositional workings of Baroque music within the domestic sphere, where it would have originally been heard and performed.
While the Duarte house on the Meir was demolished in the 19th century, one can visit the house of a neighbor of theirs, the Snijders &amp; Rockox House. It was turned into a museum, with a music room featuring period instruments and sheet music from Leonora, as the Duartes and their neighbors were known to share music.
The manuscripts for the Sinfonias are held at the Christ Church College Library at Oxford University, although for many years they were mistakenly catalogued as being composed by "Leon Duarte."

Analog delay line

An analog delay line is a network of electrical components connected in cascade, where each individual element creates a time difference between its input and output. It operates on analog signals whose amplitude varies continuously. In the case of a periodic signal, the time difference can be described in terms of a change in the phase of the signal. One example of an analog delay line is a bucket-brigade device.
Other types of delay line include acoustic (usually ultrasonic), magnetostrictive, and surface acoustic wave devices. A series of resistor–capacitor circuits (RC circuits) can be cascaded to form a delay. A long transmission line can also provide a delay element. The delay time of an analog delay line may be only a few nanoseconds or several milliseconds, limited by the practical size of the physical medium used to delay the signal and the propagation speed of impulses in the medium.
Analog delay lines are applied in many types of signal processing circuits; for example the PAL television standard uses an analog delay line to store an entire video scanline. Acoustic and electromechanical delay lines are used to provide a "reverberation" effect in musical instrument amplifiers, or to simulate an echo. High-speed oscilloscopes used an analog delay line to allow observation of waveforms just before some triggering event. Radar systems used liquid delay lines to compare one pulse of radio to another, and after World War II these were used as computer memory systems.
With the growing use of digital signal processing techniques, digital forms of delay are practical and eliminate some of the problems with dissipation and noise in analog systems.
History.
Inductor–capacitor ladder networks were used as analog delay lines in the 1920s. For example, Francis Hubbard's sonar direction finder patent filed in 1921. Hubbard referred to this as an Artificial transmission line. In 1941, Gerald Tawney of Sperry Gyroscope Company filed for a patent on a compact packaging of an inductor–capacitor ladder network that he explicitly referred to as a "time delay line".
In 1924, Robert Mathes of Bell Telephone Laboratories filed a broad patent covering essentially all electromechanical delay lines, but focusing on acoustic delay lines where an air column confined to a pipe served as the mechanical medium, and a telephone receiver at one end and a telephone transmitter at the other end served as the electromechanical transducers. Mathes was motivated by the problem of echo suppression on long-distance telephone lines, and his patent clearly explained the fundamental relationship between inductor–capacitor ladder networks and mechanical elastic delay lines such as his acoustic line.
In 1938, William Spencer Percival of Electrical &amp; Musical Industries (later EMI) applied for a patent on an acoustical delay line using piezoelectric transducers and a liquid medium. He used water or kerosene, with a 10 MHz carrier frequency, with multiple baffles and reflectors in the delay tank to create a long acoustic path in a relatively small tank.
In 1939, Laurens Hammond applied electromechanical delay lines to the problem of creating artificial reverberation for his Hammond organ. Hammond used coil springs to transmit mechanical waves between voice-coil transducers.
The problem of suppressing multipath interference in television reception motivated Clarence Hansell of RCA to use delay lines in his 1939 patent application. He used "delay cables" for this, relatively short pieces of coaxial cable used as delay lines, but he recognized the possibility of using magnetostrictive or piezoelectric delay lines.
By 1943, compact delay lines with distributed capacitance and inductance were devised. Typical early designs involved winding an enamel insulated wire on an insulating core and then surrounding that with a grounded conductive jacket. Richard Nelson of General Electric filed a patent for such a line that year. Other GE employees, John Rubel and Roy Troell, concluded that the insulated wire could be wound around a conducting core to achieve the same effect. Much of the development of delay lines during World War II was motivated by the problems encountered in radar systems.
In 1944, Madison G. Nicholson applied for a general patent on magnetostrictive delay lines. He recommended their use for applications requiring delays or measurement of intervals in the 10 to 1000 microseconds time range.
In 1945, Gordon D. Forbes and Herbert Shapiro filed a patent for the mercury delay line with piezoelectric transducers. This delay line technology would play an important role, serving as the basis of the delay-line memory used in several first-generation computers.
In 1946, David Arenberg filed patents covering the use of piezoelectric transducers attached to single crystal solid delay lines. He tried using quartz as a delay medium and reported that anisotropy in the quartz crystals caused problems. He reported success with single crystals of lithium bromide, sodium chloride and aluminum. Arlenberg developed the idea of complex 2- and 3-dimensional folding of the acoustic path in the solid medium in order to package long delays into a compact crystal. The delay lines used to decode PAL television signals follow the outline of this patent, using quartz glass as a medium instead of a single crystal.

The Sound of His Horn

The Sound of His Horn is a 1952 dystopian time travel/alternative history novel by the senior British diplomat John William Wall, written under the pseudonym Sarban. The novel has been included in several lists of the greatest fantasy novels of all time.
Plot.
Royal Navy Lieutenant Alan Querdillon becomes a German prisoner during the Battle of Crete during World War II. After escaping and travelling through a forest, he runs into a barrier of 'Bohlen Rays', is knocked unconscious, and awakens in a Nazi-controlled world at least a hundred years after World War II on the estate of the Reich Master Forester, Count Hans von Hackelnberg.
Querdillon is treated by a doctor and, at night, hears the sounds of a hunting horn, which a nurse tells him is the Count hunting. After witnessing a hunt and discovering that the prey are women dressed as birds, Querdillon asks to meet the Count. The doctor says that is too dangerous, but takes Querdillon to observe the Count feasting.
Querdillon manages to escape the doctor and join the Count's entourage to witness genetically modified leopard-women attacking deer. On the way back from the sport, the Count spots Querdillon and orders him released into the forest to be hunted. Querdillon plans to escape by tunnelling under the barrier that surrounds the estate. He also meets one of the bird-women, Kit, who helps him.
Eventually, Querdillon and Kit are hunted down by the Count, but Kit sacrifices herself to draw the leopard-woman pack onto the barrier, killing them. When the barrier is turned off to retrieve the bodies, Querdillon slips across and returns to 1943.
Title.
The book's title is from an 18th-century song about the "gentleman farmer" John Peel, a famous fox hunter in his time. In the novel, the title is given a sinister meaning that does not appear in the original, with the victorious Nazis hunting humans as if they were foxes. In his introduction to the 1960 edition of the novel by Ballantine Books, Kingsley Amis wrote, "I shall always feel a slight twinge whenever I am reminded of the innocent English hunting song from which the title is taken".
Reception.
The novel received mixed reviews upon its release. Writing for "The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction", author Damon Knight commented that the book was "a minor thing, crude in places, but persuasive." However, the novel has since gained a reputation as a classic of the genre. Literary critic Peter Nicholls has described it as "a fine story, well-told in a clear, evocative, almost formal prose." Thomas M. Disch ranked "The Sound of His Horn" at number twelve in his list of the all-time greatest fantasy stories. The book was also included by David Pringle in his book "" and by Stephen Jones and Kim Newman in their "Horror: 100 Best Books".

Riding figures

Riding figures are prescribed paths a horse is ridden on in a riding arena, usually for training purposes. Figures may also be performed out in a field or other open area, but a riding arena provides markers that can help indicate the correctness in the size or shape of a figure. 
Purposes of ring figures.
Ring figures are a valuable training aid, giving the rider feedback as to his horse's training and weaknesses. A poorly executed ring figure may point out where the rider is lacking in control, and areas in which the horse needs additional training. For example, when riding down the diagonal, a rider may struggle to keep his horse on the correct path, suggesting issues with straightness. A poorly performed 20-meter circle may indicate that the horse is not truly between the aids, perhaps falling out through a shoulder, or that the rider is sitting crookedly.
Figures are required components of dressage tests, are used in reining competition, and may also be asked for in equitation classes. Additionally, jumping courses may often be broken up into riding figures.
It is important to work the horse on figures in both directions, to ensure an equal build of muscle on either side.
Full-school and half-school.
Full-school.
The horse and rider travel along the rail all the way around the side of the arena, without changing direction. Full-school riding is often used for warming-up, to get the horse thinking forward, and is a good technique to use during the training process for horses that are naturally dull.
Additionally, it is preferred for riding lessons, giving the instructor a chance to critique each member of the class as he or she rides in front of her. For beginner lessons, full-school riding eliminates the need for them to turn, allowing them to focus on something simple, such as basic position. However, in a lesson group it requires the riders to correctly rate their horse's pace, to prevent the animal from running up behind the horse in front.
Full-school riding is also seen when showing on the flat, with all riders judged as they ride in one direction, and then asked to change direction before being judged in the other direction. Again, this provides an easy way for the judge to assess all riders in the ring.
Half-school.
As its name suggests, the horse and rider travel along one half of the arena, either along the width or the length. Half-school along the width is occasionally seen in lessons, especially if the group is small, giving the instructor a chance to critique all riders. It is also helpful when two classes are conducted in the same arena at once.
Riding along the width is mainly used for training purposes. For example, it allows the rider to focus on straightness as he rides down the centerline, and to use the 10-meter half-circles to ask for rebalancing and engagement.
Circles.
All circles are measured by their diameter. So a 20-meter circle refers to a circle with a 20-meter diameter.
20-meter circle.
The 20-meter circle is one of the most important training figures in dressage, first seen in the most simple tests possible, and continued on through Grand Prix. It is one of the first ring figures taught to beginner riders and young or green horses. Due to its size, it does not require that the horse or rider have incredible skills to ride moderately well, but circle-work should increase in quality as the horse and rider become more adept. This circle is a great test of the horse's suppleness and the rider's ability to keep the horse on the aids. Incorrect position or application of the aids, such as overuse of the inside rein, will often become apparent on the 20-meter circle.
The 20-meter circle fits very well into both the small (20 x 40 meter) and standard (20 x 60 meter) arenas, allowing the rider to use points on the wall to determine if the circle is the correct size and shape.
The 20-meter circle should be round, not egg or pear-shaped. This means that each side of the arena that touches the circle should only be met at a single point, and should "not" be ridden along for any period of time. Many novice riders go too deep into the corners of the arena, causing their circle to bulge out. Bulging or falling in both indicate that the horse is not correctly bent on the circle, or that he is leaning against the rider's leg and falling in or out.
The 20-meter circle can be used in all steps of training. Variations may include shoulder-in or haunches-in on the circle, transitions between and within gaits, extension and collection, and eventually something as advanced as flying changes, including tempi changes, on the circle.
10- and 15-meter circles.
These two circles require the horse to be more balanced than the 20-meter circle, especially the 10-meter circle, and is therefore asked for later in training. The small diameter of the 10-meter circle requires extra bend, and if the horse is not correct in his bend, the problem will be very obvious as he struggles to balance, usually falling in on the circle with his shoulders. It will also accentuate any problems the rider may have, such as an uneven seat.
The 15-meter circle is usually asked for in dressage tests at the canter, and the 10-meter at the trot. 10-meter circles at the canter require a very balanced and attentive horse.
The 10-meter circle is a favorite training tool, as it can be used to increase impulsion and bend. It is often used when beginning to train three-track movements such as shoulder-in and haunches-in, as the circle gives the horse the correct bend needed for these movements. After performing a 10-meter circle, the rider keeps the bend and simply asks the horse to continue along the long side of the arena instead of continuing around on a circle.
In conjunction with the use of the 20-meter circle, riders may spiral-in to a 10-meter circle from a 20-meter, being sure to keep the horse correctly bent. This exercise helps with engagement, as the horse must reach under himself as he changes the size of the circle and the path he is on.
Volte and Pessade.
The volte is a very small circle, having a diameter of 6 meters by definition, although trainers may vary the size of the volte depending upon the size of the horse. Of all the circles, it requires the most balance from the horse. Voltes are excellent training tools, encouraging engagement and power. However, the horse should not be pressed to perform a smaller circle than is comfortable for him, as it will sacrifice balance and bend, and possibly distress the horse.
The pessade is a half-volte, in which the hindquarters are kept to the inside, therefore making a smaller circle than the forehand. It is often used as a precursor to the pirouette, when executed at the walk and canter. It may also prepare the horse to move into the renvers.
Changing of direction.
Across the long diagonal.
The rider goes from one of the letters near the corner (K, H, M, or F), to the letter on the long side near the opposite corner (for example, K to M, or H to F). The rider does "not" go from corner to corner. There should be a stride or two of straightness between riding in the corner and beginning to go across the diagonal, and reaching the other side and going into its corner. When the rider is going across the diagonal, his horse should stay perfectly straight through his body and on his line, meeting "x" as he crosses the centerline. The rider should also be sure not to overshoot the letter he is riding to, a common fault, and instead aim to hit the wall of the arena a couple of feet before the letter.
Riding across the long diagonal may be used to change direction, and is especially helpful in a large lesson, to get the group to change direction with little risk that they will run into each other. More importantly, it is a good training tool to test the horse's straightness. Certain movements, such as flying changes, are sometimes taught across the diagonal, as are lengthening of stride. This figure appears in most dressage tests.
Across the short diagonal.
The rider goes from one K, H, M, or F to the opposite long side, but aims for either E or B. This can also be performed the opposite direction, for example riding from E to M. The rider should always go to the letter in the direction of travel (so a rider going clockwise around the ring would ride from B to K, not B to H).
This has similar uses as the long diagonal, although it is less-commonly seen in use. It can be considered slightly more advanced, as the turns come up faster than when the rider goes across the long diagonal. However, this may be beneficial for horses that tend to get quicker and quicker across the long diagonal.
Half-volte to wall.
Changing direction through a half-volte is usually taught quite early on in a rider's career. In this figure, the rider riding on long side of the arena performs a half-volte toward the inside of the ring, before gradually coming back to the wall. It is not asked for in dressage tests, but is one of the most common ways judges ask for a change of direction in the show ring, as it provides a fairly quick change of direction.
This figure (also to be known as the 'tear drop') can also be used for more advanced training. For leg-yielding, the half-volte is used to get increased engagement from the horse, and the animal is then leg-yield back to the track instead of being allowed to drift back there. The horse has a relatively short distance to cover, and is generally naturally drawn to the wall. In half-pass, the volte can be used to establish bend, before asking for a half-pass back to the wall. It is helpful to remember this shape when ridding through it.
Through a circle.
This change of direction is one of the more advanced, and is often asked when a rider wishes to change the direction of his circle, without losing the benefits of the bend. The rider starts on a 20-meter circle. When he wishes to change direction, which he may do so at any point on the circle, he performs a 10-meter half-circle, continuing in the same direction of travel, to the center point of his original circle. He then immediately performs a 10-meter circle in the opposite direction, from the center point back to the 20-meter circle.
Properly ridden, the horse will have correct bend in both half circles, changing flawlessly at the center point. The horse should not lose rhythm or forwardness. Both 10-meter half circles should be of equal size and shape, not grossly large or too flat.
This change of direction generally increases the engagement of the horse. It requires the horse to be on the aids, and is useful in pointing out any rider problems, as the quick change of direction for 10-meter to 10-meter circle will easily allow the horse to fall in or out if the rider is not keeping him straight. If the two 10-meter half-circles were not the same size, there is likely a training or riding error.
Lines.
Down the centerline.
The horse is ridden down the imaginary centerline of the arena, from the letters C to A or vice versa. This is one of the best ways to test the straightness of the horse, as the sides of the arena usually guide horses into straightness, while the centerline is very open. The centerline may also be used as a way to change direction, although it is generally not as preferred as the other options.
The horse should first and foremost stay straight through his whole body, without dropping a shoulder or haunch inward. The horse should also not "wobble" side to side, but continue in a straight direction. When viewed from the top, the horse would be perfectly bisected by the centerline.
One of the most common faults of the novice rider is to over-shoot the centerline, turning too late from the long side of the arena. This may be helped if the rider starts looking toward the centerline well in advance.
This movement is asked at least twice in every dressage test, as the horse first enters the arena, and at the very end of the test. As there is always a judge sitting at C, it is easy for him to judge the horse's straightness in the test as he views the approaching him animal head-on (unlike some movements, such as those across the diagonal, which may be a bit harder to judge on straightness). Since the movement is both the first and last movement in the test, it provides the first and final impressions. Therefore, the rider should be extra careful to practice coming down the centerline.
Down the quarterline.
The rider rides down the quarterline (which falls half-way between the centerline and the long side of the arena). This has similar benefits as riding down the centerline, as it tests for straightness.
Riding down the quarterline is especially useful in training for leg-yield, as the rider can leg-yield from the quarterline to the wall, requiring only a few steps of leg-yield in a direction. Eventually, the rider may ask the horse to leg-yield back and forth several times, from the wall to quarterline to wall.
Looping figures.
Figure-eight.
As the name suggests, the rider performs a figure-8 in the arena. It is useful in that it may be used to change direction, and is also used as a training tool.
This figure is usually ridden as the shape of two 20-meter circles, rather than having any straight sections to it, as the horse then has the benefit of the bending on the circles. The rider should therefore pay attention to similar faults and errors of the 20-meter circle. Additionally, the change of direction at X should be smooth.
The figure-8 can be used for warm-up, encouraging the horse to go forward while working him both directions. It is a fairly simple figure, and may be applied to both beginner riders and young horses. For jumping riders, a simple exercise with fences laid out along a figure-eight can help with bending and quick reflexes.
Serpentine.
S-shaped figure, usually with three or four loops, although for training purposes there may be many more. The size and shape of the loops may vary, including loops that have several strides of straightness between each bending phase and loops with only one stride of straightness between change of bend. Loops may also be more "bow-tie" in fashion, looping back over themselves. In all cases, however, the loops should be of equal size and shape to the others in the serpentine.
The serpentine is used mainly as a training tool for bending, as it requires at least two changes of bend across the riding school. Change of bend should always be smooth, and the horse should not fall in or out while looping. The serpentine may be used to change direction, if it has an even number of loops.
Serpentines are also asked for in some dressage tests. They are fairly basic, and can be taught to young horses. They are good for improving steering in inexperienced riders who have basic steering skills. However, no horse or rider should be pushed to do more loops than they are ready for.
Shallow loop/Single serpentine on long side.
This is not so much a serpentine as a slight curve in the track as the rider goes along the long side. He should gently move off the track a few meters, before returning to it.
This figure especially useful in teaching counter-canter. The horse is asked for the correct lead, before moving him off the track a few strides. He is then asked to return to the track without changing to the "correct" lead, and to instead perform the counter-canter.

Hanabusa Itchō

 was a Japanese painter born in Osaka, calligrapher, and haiku poet. He originally trained in the Kanō style, under Kanō Yasunobu, but ultimately rejected that style and became a literati ("bunjin"). He was also known as Hishikawa Waō and by a number of other art-names.
Biography.
The son of a physician, he was originally named Taga Shinkō. He studied Kanō painting, but soon abandoned the school and his master to form his own style, which would come to be known as the Hanabusa school.
He was exiled in 1698, for parodying one of the shōgun's concubines in painting, to the island of Miyake-jima; he would not return until 1710. That year, in Edo, the artist would formally take the name Hanabusa Itchō.
Most of his paintings depicted typical urban life in Edo, and were approached from the perspective of a literati painter. His style, in-between the Kanō and ukiyo-e, is said to have been "more poetic and less formalistic than the Kanō school, and typical of the "bourgeois" spirit of the Genroku period".
Hanabusa was the master of the later painter Sawaki Suushi.
Hanabusa studied poetry under the master Matsuo Bashō, and is said to have been an excellent calligrapher as well. His friends included the poets Matsuo Bashō and Enomoto Kikaku.
His work is held in several institutions worldwide, including the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Libraries, the Israel Museum , the Suntory Museum of Art, the Seattle Art Museum, the Museum of Cultural History Oslo, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the National Museum of Korea, and the British Museum.

Prairie Sentinels Park

Prairie Sentinels Park (formerly known as Nygard Park) is a public park located in the centre of the town of Deloraine, Manitoba.
The park host more than 200 flags from around the world. The park is landscaped with a brick wall facade, paved walking paths, and a commemorative plaque recognizing Peter Nygård's financial contribution to the town.
History.
As the year 2001 neared, the town of Deloraine developed the "Fly the Flags of the World" millennium project with the goal of displaying flags from all over the world. The project started with a letter writing campaign to each country’s embassy asking for the donation of their national flag. If this was not fruitful, the flag was purchased. The flags would be displayed throughout the town, but the majority would fly in Nygard Park. 
Prior to the renovation, the future site of Nygard Park was a rundown Canadian Pacific Railway yard. Peter Nygård donated $25,000 and 5000 Nygård T-shirts to the town to revitalize the area. The sale of the T-shirts raised approximately $50,000. A portion of the donated money was set aside to cover the cost for future replacement of worn out flags.
In July 2006, the whole town celebrated the opening of the park and the raising of the 206 flags. The flags represent 193 nations, plus the 13 provincial and territorial flags of Canada. Mr. Nygård acted as the town marshal, driving in a parade through the streets of the town. He was there with Hilkka Nygård, his mother. He staged a fashion show featuring super-model Beverly Johnson.
After Peter Nygård was the central figure in a lawsuit alleging child sex trafficking and rape against him in 2020 calls were made to drop Nygard's name from the park. In May 2020, the name of the park was changed to Prairie Sentinels Park. The park was also remodeled with a walking path dotted with 19 storyboards showing the history of the area's grain elevators and industry. In addition the flags were changed to now represent the flags of countries that buy wheat from Manitoba. Small grain elevator models, built for use in parade floats, are also planned to appear in the park.
Flag adoption.
Flags need to be replaced every two years, due to weathering. This significant cost is offset by flag adoptions. Adopters are noted in the "Flying the Flags of the World" booklets, which is updated annually.
Tourism.
The "Flying the Flags of the World" booklet is available free of charge at the Information Centre. Inside is information regarding each flag's location and its symbolism.

Bill Lee (right-handed pitcher)

William Crutcher "Big Bill" Lee (October 21, 1909 – June 15, 1977) was a Major League Baseball pitcher. He played professionally for the Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies, and Boston Braves during the 1930s and 1940s.
Early life and career.
Lee was born in Plaquemine, Louisiana, and played college baseball as a freshman for Louisiana State University. He was originally a top prospect in the St. Louis Cardinals organization. In August 1933, Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey called his counterpart with the Cubs, William Veeck, Sr. and offered him two pitchers—Lee and Clarence Heise. According to Bill Veeck, one of Rickey's favorite tricks was to offer another team two players and trust that the other team would take the wrong one. In the case of Lee and Heise, Rickey knew that all but one Cubs pitcher was right-handed, and expected the Cubs to take Heise, a left-hander. However, on the advice of chief scout Jack Doyle, the Cubs took Lee. As it turned out, Heise would make only one relief appearance in 1934, and was never heard from again. It was one of the few times where Rickey, who was legendary for fleecing National League teams, ended up getting fleeced himself.
Lee spent 10 full seasons with the Cubs, as well as a pair of cameo appearances in 1947. He made his major league debut on April 29, 1934, with the Cubs. He saved Game 5 of the 1935 World Series at Wrigley Field, with his team on the verge of elimination, and his best year was in 1938 when he helped lead the Cubs to another World Series with a league-leading 22 wins and a 2.66 ERA. He was on the National League All-Star Team twice when he played for the Cubs.
Lee played for the Phillies from 1943–1945 and for the Braves from 1945–1946. Lee developed eye problems which made it difficult for him to see the catcher's signs. Eyeglasses helped little, and he retired in 1947 while playing for the Cubs.
Lee's career marks were 169 wins, 157 losses and a 3.54 ERA. His 139 wins with the Cubs are still the ninth-most in franchise history.
Life after baseball.
After retiring, Lee returned to Plaquemine, Louisiana, and had eye surgery for his detached retinas. He eventually lost sight in one eye Lee suffered a heart attack in 1976 while visiting in Texas and died on June 15, 1977, and is interred in Saint John Cemetery in Plaquemine.
Awards and honors.
Lee was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1962.

Alyssoides

Alyssoides is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae containing a single species, Alyssoides utriculata. A herbaceous perennial plant native to Southern Europe and Turkey, it grows on dry rocky slopes and on calcareous rocks, reaching heights of 20 to 50cm and blooming with yellow flowers between April and May–July.
The genus formerly contained a second species, "Alyssoides cretica", but after molecular phylogenetic studies from 2008 and 2013 it was reassigned to the genus "Lutzia".
There are two subspecies: the "A. utricalata" subsp. "utriculata", and "A. utriculata" subsp. "bulgarica", which characteristically differ by the pattern and shape of their hairs.
"Alyssoides utriculata" is used as an ornamental plant and in gardening may be referred to as "inflated bladderseed" or as (Greek) bladderpod (not to be confused with other plants named "bladderpod").
Distribution.
The plant's distribution ranges from southern France to Turkey. It is found in the Massif Central of France, the Western Alps, the Apennines of Italy, the Dinaric Alps of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Albania; in western Kosovo, in Serbia (the Tara and Rtanj mountains among others), in the south of North Macedonia, in Greece (from low elevations up to 2200(-2500)m; relatively common in the north-east, in more isolated locations in the north (Vourinos, Vermion, Olympus, and a few localities in Pindus) and the central areas (Pentelikon, Parnis, Parnassus and Giona)), in Bulgaria (at elevations of 50–1900m in Stara Planina, the Rhodopes, Strandzha and the southwest), southwestern Romania, and northern Anatolia.

Efua Sutherland

Efua Theodora Sutherland (born 27 June 1924 – 2 January 1996) was a Ghanaian playwright, director, dramatist, children's author, poet, educationalist, researcher, child advocate, and cultural activist. Her works include the plays "Foriwa" (1962), "Edufa" (1967), and "The Marriage of Anansewa" (1975). She founded the Ghana Drama Studio, the Ghana Society of Writers, the Ghana Experimental Theatre, and a community project called the Kodzidan (Story House). As Ghana's earliest playwright-director, she was an influential figure in the development of modern Ghanaian theatre, and helped to introduce the study of African performance traditions at university level. She was also a pioneering African publisher, establishing the company Afram Publications in Accra in the 1970s.
She was a cultural advocate for children from the early 1950s until her death, and played a role in developing educational curricula, literature, theatre and film for and about Ghanaian children. Her 1960 photo essay "Playtime in Africa", co-authored with Willis E. Bell, highlighted the centrality of play in children's development and was followed in the 1980s by her leadership in the development of a model public children's parks system for the country.
Sutherland's pan-Africanism was reflected in her support for its principles and her collaborations with African and African diaspora personalities in a range of disciplines, including interactions with Chinua Achebe, Ama Ata Aidoo, Maya Angelou, W. E. B. Du Bois and Shirley Graham Du Bois, Margaret Busby, Tom Feelings, Langston Hughes, Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King, Femi Osofisan, Félix Morisseau-Leroy, Es'kia Mphahlele, Wole Soyinka and Ngugi wa Thiong'o. Having in 1980 written an original proposal for a pan-African historical theatre festival in Ghana as a cultural vehicle for bringing together Africans around the globe, Sutherland was the inspiration behind the biennial Pan-African festival of theatre arts known as PANAFEST, first held in 1992.
Efua Sutherland died in Accra aged 71 in 1996.
Education and early career.
She was born as Efua Theodora Morgue in Cape Coast, Gold Coast (now Ghana), where she studied teaching at St Monica's Training College in Mampong. She then went to England to continue her education, earning a BA degree at Homerton College, Cambridge University — one of the first African women to study there — and studying linguistics at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London.
Returning to Ghana in 1951, she taught first at Fijai Secondary School at Sekondi, then at St. Monica's School (1951–54), and also began writing for children. She would later say: "I started writing seriously in 1951. I can even remember the precise time. It was at Easter. I had been thinking about the problem of literature in my country for a very long time. I was on teaching practice with my students once in a village and I got positively angry about the kind of literature that the children were being forced into. It had nothing to do with their environment, their social circumstances or anything. And so I started writing."
In 1954, she married Bill Sutherland, an African American and Pan-Africanist, who in 1953 had moved to Ghana. They had three children – educationalist Esi Sutherland-Addy, architect Ralph Sutherland, and lawyer Amowi Sutherland Phillips) – and she helped her husband in the establishment of a school in the Transvolta area.
Literary production.
When the Gold Coast became the independent nation of Ghana in 1957, Efua Sutherland organised the Ghana Society of Writers (later the Ghana Association of Writers), which in 1960 brought out the first issue of the literary magazine "Okyeame", with Sutherland eventually becoming editor.
Sutherland experimented creatively with storytelling and other dramatic forms from indigenous Ghanaian traditions. Her plays were often based on traditional stories, but also borrowed from Western literature, transforming African folktale conventions into modern dramatic theatre techniques. Many of her poems and other writings were broadcast on "The Singing Net", a popular radio programme started by Henry Swanzy, and were subsequently published in his 1958 anthology "Voices of Ghana". The 1960 first issue of "Okyeame" magazine contains her short story "Samantaase", a retelling of a folktale. Her best known plays are "Edufa" (1967) (based on "Alcestis" by Euripides), "Foriwa" (1967), and "The Marriage of Anansewa" (1975).
In 1958, Sutherland founded the Ghana Experimental Theatre, which was based at the Ghana Drama Studio built by Sutherland and launched by President Kwame Nkrumah in 1963 with Joe de Graft as its first director. Sited in downtown Accra, the Drama Studio became a training ground for a range of theatre practitioners from all over Africa. In 1962, she joined the staff of the new School of Music and Drama, headed by J. H. Kwabena Nketia. In 1963, when Sutherland took on the role of Research Associate at the Institute of African Studies, University of Ghana, she brought along with her the Ghana Drama Studio, which became an off-campus training space, called the University of Ghana Drama Studio. Sutherland, in addition to her field research and teaching in African Dramatic Forms, was a core member of the team that conceptualised and established the School of Performing Arts. Also concerned with traditional storytelling and developing community theatre, she founded the Kodzidan (Story House) in Ekumfi-Atwia, Central Region, which was recognised worldwide as a pioneering model in theatre for development.
Sutherland mentored and was in turn inspired by many of Ghana's accomplished writers, including Ama Ata Aidoo, Kofi Anyidoho and Meshack Asare.
In the early 1970s, Sutherland co-founded the publishing company Afram Publications, which was incorporated in 1973, and in March 1974 began operating from her private studio in "Araba Mansa", her compound at Dzorwulu, Accra. Sutherland remained involved in Afram's editorial work until her death.
Cultural activism and pan-Africanism.
Sutherland's work attracted the attention of creatives from the global African world. Maya Angelou's fifth volume of memoirs "All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes" testifies to the emotional support and entrée into Ghanaian society afforded her in the 1960s by Efua Sutherland who became a close friend.
Sutherland had met Dr W. E. B. Du Bois when she led the Ghana delegation to the 1958 Afro-Asian Writers Conference in Tashkent (now the capital of Uzbekistan). She was to personally intervene, at his death in Accra, Ghana in 1963, to support Mrs Shirley Du Bois. In the 1980s Sutherland was instrumental in establishing the W.E.B. Du Bois Memorial Centre for Pan African Culture and mausoleum at the Du Bois' Accra home.
In 1980, Sutherland wrote a paper entitled "Proposal for a Historical Drama Festival in Cape Coast", underscoring the significance she attached to connections between Africa and its Diaspora. This inspired the venture that came to fruition as the state-sponsored PANAFEST, the first Pan-African Historical Theater Festival, which was held in Cape Coast, Elmina and Accra, Ghana, from 12 to 19 December 1992, under the theme "The Re-emergence of African Civilization".
Advocacy for children.
Sutherland presided over Ghana's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (the first country to do so) and chaired the National Commission on Children from 1983 to 1990, a period that marked the most vigorous and comprehensive child advocacy on a national scale in the history of Ghana. In this capacity, she steered a number of innovative programmes, including a Child Education Fund to support underserved communities, the Mobile Technical Workshop extending science learning to poor or rural children, and the securing of land to seed model child-centred park and library complexes around the country. She laid the groundwork for the Mmofra Foundation, active since 1997 as a civic organisation dedicated to enriching the cultural and intellectual lives of all children in Ghana. In 2012 the "Playtime in Africa Initiative", inspired by her eponymous 1961 book, was launched to revitalise child-friendly public space advocacy.
Her final most significant work at the Institute of African Studies, Legon, was her Children's Drama Development Project, which was aimed at developing materials, methods and staff for programmes of creative dramatics in and out of school. Sutherland was invited by UNICEF to join a worldwide network of scholars to consider a code of human rights for the protection of children.
Florence Laast, founder of Accra's St Martin de Porres School, speaking of how her own life had been impacted by Sutherland's mentorship, described her as "one of the greatest thinkers of our time" who believed that "the home is our first classroom, and our parents the first teachers".
Works briefly annotated.
Sutherland experimented creatively with storytelling and other dramatic forms from indigenous Ghanaian traditions. Her plays were often based on traditional stories, but also borrowed from Western literature, transforming African folktale conventions into modern dramatic theatre techniques. Many of her poems and other writings were broadcast on "The Singing Net", a popular radio programme started by Henry Swanzy, and were subsequently published in his 1958 anthology "Voices of Ghana". The 1960 first issue of "Okyeame" magazine contains her short story "Samantaase", a retelling of a folktale. Her best known plays are "Edufa" (1967) (based on "Alcestis" by Euripides), "Foriwa" (1967), and "The Marriage of Anansewa" (1975).
In "Edufa" the eponymous character seeks to escape death by manipulating his wife, Ampoma, to the death that has been predicted for him by oracles. In the play, Sutherland uses traditional Ghanaian beliefs in divination and the interaction of traditional and European ceremonies in order to portray Edufa as a rich and successful modern person who is held in high esteem by his people. The play uses traditional ritual and symbolism, but the story is told in the context of Edufa's capitalistic abandonment of his moral commitment to his wife, while his wife and the other women favour the morality of the past.
In "Foriwa" the eponymous character, who is the daughter of the queen mother of Kyerefaso, and Labaran, a graduate from northern Ghana who lives a simple life, bring enlightenment to Kyerefaso, a town that has become backward and ignorant because the town's elders refuse to learn new ways. "Foriwa's" main theme is the alliance of old traditions and new ways. The play has a national theme to promote a new national spirit in Ghana that would encourage openness to new ideas and inter-ethnic cooperation.
"The Marriage of Anansewa: A Storytelling Drama" (1975) is considered Sutherland's most valuable contribution to Ghanaian drama and theater. In the play, she transmutes traditional Akan tales of Ananse Spider ("Anansesem") into a new dramatic structure, which she calls "Anansegoro". "Nyamekye" (a version of "Alice in Wonderland"), one of her later plays, shows how she was influenced by the folk opera tradition.
Sutherland was also an author of works for children. These works included two animated rhythm plays, "Vulture! Vulture!" and "Tahinta" (1968), and two pictorial essays, with photographs by Willis Bell (1924–2000): "Playtime in Africa" (1960) and "The Roadmakers" (1961). Many of her short stories can be described as rhythmic prose poems. "Voice in the Forest", a book of the folklore and fairytales of Ghana, was published in 1983.
"Playtime in Africa" has been described "a groundbreaking book on Ghana's play culture", which Sutherland considered important for in developing young minds and bodies. Not only was it published three years after Ghana's independence it was the first documentation of children's play culture in Ghana. The book presented the nuances of children's lives to forefront of society and it also ushered in an indigenous movement in writing for children, along with publishing and development through drama for children.
A "Voice in the Forest" is a text that powerfully portrays the political, economic, and social complexity of colonialism and cultural relativism in Ghana in regards to children. The text is a retelling of an Akan folktale and deals with traditional cultural values through the role of the trickster figure. It tells the story of a man named Bempong who unknowingly discovers a Samanta, a wood nymph, and brings her back to his village. Initially Bempong believes the Samanta is a lost girl, wandering alone through the forest. For the first half of the story the Samanta refuses to speak. It is not until Bempong cuts off her hair, in an effort to tame her outgrown hair, that Bempong realizes this girl is a Samanta, a wood nymph—"a creature of strange magical powers". Finding her voice in a moment of anger, the Samanta curses the village, leaving them with no food until she has her hair back. The hero of the book is Afrum, Bempong's son, who is regarded as the village fool. Sutherland's choice to celebrate the fool is a part of a longer lineage of uses of the trickster figure in African literature.
Honours.
In 2020, at an event marking International Women's Day, Sutherland was honoured by 3Music Awards for her achievements in the entertainment industry.
In March 2024, the estate of Efua Sutherland launched a centenary celebration of her life and legacy in Accra, unveiling plans to commemorate the year in which she would have turned 100.

Compu-Spell

Compu-Spell is educational software developed by Sherwin Steffin and Steven Pederson of Edu-Ware Services for the Apple II in 1980.
Summary.
It is designed to teach spelling based on the assumption that spelling is a memorization (as opposed to rule-based) task. The program presents a series of spelling words within sentences, and then requires the learner to type in the spelling words. In "learning" mode, the program would ignore incorrect letters, with the idea being that seeing an incorrect spelling on the screen would interfere with memorizing a correct spelling. (The user could continually guess at the next correct letter or press ESC to show the correct spelling.) Misspelled words are presented again to learners, who must retype spelling words until they are spelled correctly. The program periodically presents spelling words from previous lessons to reinforce memoirization.
The program was sold with data disks of spelling words for grade levels 4 through 8, each containing 800 to 1200 spelling words, along with an "adult/secretarial' disk featuring the most frequently misspelled words in the English language. Designed for both home and classroom use, the program includes a classroom management system allowing teachers to track the progress of many students, a number of settings used by teachers to control the learning process, and a file-building system for adding new spelling words and sentences.

Autoimmune pancreatitis

Autoimmune Pancreatitis (AIP) is an increasingly recognized type of chronic pancreatitis that can be difficult to distinguish from pancreatic carcinoma but which responds to treatment with corticosteroids, particularly prednisone. Although autoimmune pancreatitis is quite rare, it constitutes an important clinical problem for both patients and their clinicians: the disease commonly presents itself as a tumorous mass which is diagnostically indistinguishable from pancreatic cancer, a disease that is much more common in addition to being very dangerous. Hence, some patients undergo pancreatic surgery, which is associated to substantial mortality and morbidity, out of the fear by patients and clinicians to undertreat a malignancy. However, surgery is not a good treatment for this condition as AIP responds well to immunosuppressive treatment. There are two categories of AIP: Type 1 and Type 2, each with distinct clinical profiles.
Type 1 AIP is now regarded as a manifestation of IgG4-related disease, and those affected have tended to be older and to have a high relapse rate. Type 1 pancreatitis, is as such as manifestation of IgG4 disease, which may also affect bile ducts in the liver, salivary glands, kidneys and lymph nodes. Type 2 AIP seems to affect only the pancreas, although about one-third of people with type 2 AIP have associated inflammatory bowel disease. AIP occurring in association with an autoimmune disorder has been referred to as "secondary" or "syndromic" AIP. AIP does not affect long-term survival.
Signs and symptoms.
Autoimmune pancreatitis may cause a variety of symptoms and signs, which include pancreatic and biliary (bile duct) manifestations, as well as systemic effects of the disease. Two-thirds of patients present with either painless jaundice due to bile duct obstruction or a "mass" in the head of the pancreas, mimicking carcinoma. As such, a thorough evaluation to rule out cancer is important in cases of suspected AIP.
Type 1 AIP typically presents in a 60–70-year-old male with painless jaundice. In some cases, imaging reveals a mass in the pancreas or diffuse pancreatic enlargement. Narrowing in the pancreatic duct called strictures may occur. Rarely, Type 1 AIP presents with acute pancreatitis. Type 1 AIP presents with manifestations of autoimmune disease (IgG4 related) in at least half of cases. The most common form of systemic involvement is cholangitis, which occurs in up to 80 percent of cases of Type 1 AIP. Additional manifestations include inflammation in the salivary glands (chronic sclerosing sialadenitis), in the lungs resulting in scarring (pulmonary fibrosis) and nodules, scarring within the chest cavity (mediastinal fibrosis) or in the anatomic space behind the abdomen (retroperitoneal fibrosis) and inflammation in the kidneys (tubulointerstitial nephritis).
AIP is characterized by the following features:
Histopathology.
Histopathologic examination of the pancreas reveals a characteristic lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate of CD4- or CD8-positive lymphocytes and IgG4-positive plasma cells, and exhibits interstitial fibrosis and acinar cell atrophy in later stages. At the initial stages, typically, there is a cuff of lymphoplasma cells surrounding the ducts but also more diffuse infiltration in the lobular parenchyma. However, localization and the degree of duct wall infiltration are variable. Whereas histopathologic examination remains the primary method for differentiation of AIP from acute and chronic pancreatitis, lymphoma, and cancer. By Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) the diagnosis can be made if adequate tissue is obtained. In such cases, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the lobules are the key finding. Rarely, granulomatous reaction could be observed. It has been proposed that a cytologic smear primarily composed of acini rich in chronic inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells), with rare ductal epithelial cells lacking atypia, favors the diagnosis of AIP. The sensitivity and the specificity of these criteria for differentiating AIP from neoplasia are unknown. In cases of systemic manifestation of AIP, the pathologic features are similar in other organs.
Although the exact mechanism explaining the clinical manifestations of autoimmune pancreatitis remain for an important part obscure, most professionals would agree that the development of IgG4 antibodies, recognizing an epitiope on the membrane of pancreatic ancinar cells is an important factor in the pathophysiology of the disease. These antibodies are postulated to provoke an immune response against these ancinar cells resulting in pancreatic inflammation and destruction. Knowing the auto-antigens involved would allow early diagnosis of the disease, its differentiation from a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, and potentially even prevention, but unfortunately these remain obscure. An earlier publication suggested that the human ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 2 (UBR2) was an important antigen but follow up studies suggested this finding is likely to be an artifact. Hence improved diagnosis, understanding and treatment of autoimmune pancreatitis awaits the identification of the auto-antigens involved.
Diagnosis.
Criteria.
Most recently the fourteenth Congress of the International Association of Pancreatology developed the International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria (ICDC) for AIP. The ICDC emphasizes five cardinal features of AIP which includes the imaging appearance of pancreatic parenchyma and the pancreatic duct, serum IgG4 level, other organ involvement with IgG4-related disease, pancreatic histology and response to steroid therapy.
In 2002, the Japanese Pancreas Society proposed the following diagnostic criteria for autoimmune pancreatitis:
For diagnosis, criterion I (pancreatic imaging) must be present with criterion II (laboratory data) and/or III (histopathologic findings).
Mayo Clinic has come up with five diagnostic criteria called HISORt criteria which stands for histology, imaging, serology, other organ involvement, and response to steroid therapy.
Radiologic features.
Computed tomography (CT) findings in AIP include a "diffusely enlarged hypodense" pancreas or a focal mass that may be mistaken for a pancreatic malignancy. A low-density, "capsule-like rim on CT" (possibly corresponding to an inflammatory process involving peripancreatic tissues) is thought to be an additional characteristic feature (thus the mnemonic: "sausage-shaped"). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals a diffusely decreased signal intensity and delayed enhancement on dynamic scanning. The characteristic ERCP finding is segmental or diffuse irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct, usually accompanied by an extrinsic-appearing stricture of the distal bile duct. Changes in the extrapancreatic bile duct similar to those of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have been reported.
The role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in the diagnosis of AIP is not well described, and EUS findings have been described in only a small number of patients. In one study, EUS revealed a diffusely swollen and hypoechoic pancreas in 8 of the 14 (57%) patients, and a solitary, focal, irregular mass was observed in 6 (46%) patients. Whereas EUS-FNA is sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy, its role in the diagnosis of AIP remains unclear.
Treatment.
AIP often completely resolves with steroid treatment. The failure to differentiate AIP from malignancy may lead to unnecessary pancreatic resection, and the characteristic lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate of AIP has been found in up to 23% of patients undergoing pancreatic resection for suspected malignancy who are ultimately found to have benign disease. In this subset of patients, a trial of steroid therapy may have prevented a Whipple procedure or complete pancreatectomy for a benign disease which responds well to medical therapy. "This benign disease resembles pancreatic carcinoma both clinically and radiographically. The diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis is challenging to make. However, accurate and timely diagnosis may preempt the misdiagnosis of cancer and decrease the number of unnecessary pancreatic resections." Autoimmune pancreatitis responds dramatically to corticosteroid treatment.
If relapse occurs after corticosteroid treatment or corticosteroid treatment is not tolerated, immunomodulators may be used. Immunomodulators such as azathioprine, and 6-mercaptopurine have been shown to extend remission of autoimmune pancreatitis after corticosteroid treatment. If corticosteroid and immunomodulator treatments are not sufficient, rituximab may also be used. Rituximab has been shown to induce and maintain remission.
Prognosis.
AIP does not affect long-term survival.
Epidemiology.
AIP is relatively uncommon, with an overall global prevalence less than 1 per 100,000. Type 1 AIP is more common in East Asia, whereas type 2 is relatively more common in the US and Europe. The prevalence of AIP may be increasing in Japan. Type 1 AIP occurs three times more often in men than women.
Controversies in nomenclature.
As the number of published cases of AIP has increased, efforts have been focused on defining AIP as a distinct clinical and pathologic entity and toward developing some generally agreed upon diagnostic criteria and nomenclature. Terms frequently encountered are autoimmune or autoimmune-related pancreatitis, lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis, idiopathic tumefactive chronic pancreatitis, idiopathic pancreatitis with focal irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct, and non-alcoholic duct destructive chronic pancreatitis.
There are also a large number of case reports employing descriptive terminology such as pancreatitis associated with Sjögren's syndrome, primary sclerosing cholangitis, or inflammatory bowel disease. Some of the earliest cases were reported as pancreatic pseudotumor or pseudolymphoma.

Surficial aquifer

Surficial aquifers are shallow aquifers typically less than thick, but larger surficial aquifers of about have been mapped. They mostly consist of unconsolidated sand enclosed by layers of limestone, sandstone or clay and the water is commonly extracted for urban use. The aquifers are replenished by streams and from precipitation and can vary in volume considerably as the water table fluctuates. Being shallow, they are susceptible to contamination by fuel spills, industrial discharge, landfills, and saltwater. Parts of southeastern United States are dependent on surficial aquifers for their water supplies.
Composition.
Surficial aquifers system consists mostly of beds of unconsolidated sand, cavity-riddled limestone and shells, sandstone, sand, and clay sand with minor clay or silt from the Pliocene to Holocene periods. 
In most cases the flow system is undivided, though in places, clay beds are sufficiently thick and continuous to divide the system into two or three aquifers. Complex interbedding of fine and coarse-textured rocks is typical of the system. These rocks range from late Miocene to Holocene periods. 
In Georgia and South Carolina, unnamed, sandy, marine terrace deposits of Pleistocene age and sand of Holocene age comprise the system. These sandy beds commonly contain clay and silt.
In Florida, these aquifers are shallow beds of sea shells and sand that lie less than underground. They are separated from the Floridan Aquifer by a confining bed of soil. Some have been contaminated by saltwater, yet they provide most of the public freshwater supply southwest of Lake Okeechobee and along the Atlantic coast north of Palm Beach.
In surficial aquifers, the groundwater continuously moves along the hydraulic gradient from areas of recharge to streams and other places of discharge. Surficial aquifers are recharged locally as the water table fluctuates in response to drought or rainfall. Therefore, the temperature and flow from water-table springs varies.
Important surficial aquifers.
The Biscayne Aquifer is a surficial aquifer located in southeast Florida. It covers over , and is the most intensely used water source in Florida, supplying water to Dade County, Broward County, Palm Beach County and Monroe County. The aquifer lies close to the surface and is extremely vulnerable to pollutants that leach through the shallow limestone bedrock. In some areas, it has been contaminated by fuel spills, industrial discharge, landfills, and saltwater.
The Sand and Gravel Aquifer stretches across the panhandle of Florida and is replenished with rainfall. Over the years water levels have dropped due to water-well use by pumping, and it has been contaminated by industrial waste and saltwater intrusion.
The Chokoloskee Aquifer is surficial aquifer that covers in southwest Florida. It is recharged by rainfall. It is believed that artificial drainage canals have lowered water levels and increased saltwater intrusion.

Darts world rankings

The Darts World Rankings are systems designed to determine a list of the best darts players in the world based on their performances in past tournaments.
In 1993, a group of former world champions and other high-profile players separated from the British Darts Organisation, meaning there were several major governing bodies in the sport. Each organization has its own players, and each has its own ranking system.
After the British Darts Organisation folded in 2020, the two main rankings are now maintained by the World Darts Federation and the Professional Darts Corporation.
The ranking systems are used to arrange tournament seedings, which are so arranged, that the number one player in the world will not face the number two player until the final of a tournament, providing they both reach that final.
PDC World Rankings.
The Professional Darts Corporation's Ranking is based on the amount of prize money won in ranking tournaments on a two year cycle.
WDF World rankings.
The rankings are based on a cumulative points system, calculated on a rolling one-year basis. When a tournament is played, the previous year's results are removed from the rankings and the new tournament scores are used. This list is used to determine seeds for some of the WDF Opens. The World Darts Federation ranking system is designed to provide a measure of the global activities of darts players in every WDF recognized darts event. It used to be very similar to the BDO system but was revised in January 2007 to include categories by country and by events, and the distribution of ranking points reflect the levels of prize money on offer and the numbers of entries in a tournament. Players gain points in six levels of categorized events and prize money and at the end of the season the leading players receive monetary bonus rewards from the WDF.
Current points distribution.
"Points are currently awarded as follows:"
Previous World Number Ones (Men's, WDF).
The following is a list of players who ended the year ranked number one in the WDF.
BDO rankings.
The BDO Invitational Table relates only to registered playing members of the BDO, who comply with BDO and World Darts Federation (WDF) eligibility rules, including terms and conditions of the 1997 Tomlin Order.
The BDO awards points depending on a player's performances within each of its events and other BDO-recognised qualifying events. Forty-nine points are awarded to the champion of each of its three Major Events – The Lakeside World Professional Championship, The Bavaria World Darts Trophy and the Winmau World Masters and A+ events. Lower points are awarded for each round of the tournament reached. Other events are placed into Category A, B, C, and D based on the prize pool and number of payouts, with points for placings slowly decreasing. Only the best 12 placings are added for a player's ranking.
Final rankings.
Following a cease in tournaments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the BDO stopped publishing rankings on 18 March 2020. The BDO having entered liquidation in September of that year, what follows are the final published rankings by the organisation.

Kharagauli ( ) is an administrative center of Kharagauli district in Georgia. It is situated on both banks of river in a narrow and deep gorge, 280-400m above the sea level.
Founding.
It was founded as a railway station in the 1870s, when the Poti-Tbilisi railway was built. Kharagauli assumed an administrative, later an economic, function.
Geography.
In the west entrance of the area, the Chkherimela river flows through a narrow gorge. On the left bank of the river, there are two statues of giants; on the right, two large holes. This area, referred to as "the giant's hole" serves as a minor tourist attraction. The riverbank also has a large park. 
Up the gorge, there are ruins of an old fortress from the Middle Ages, referred to as Khandi or Kharagauli Fortress. The fortress is notable for being the site at which Vakhtang VI of Kartli was married. Additionally, there are tombs on a mountain nearby from the 14th to 11th centuries BCE, as well as the ruins of a Christian church.
In the center of the borough, there is a three-story administration building. There are three secondary schools in the region, one seminary, two kindergartens, a hospital, a polyclinic, a library, a musical school, a theatre, a court, a post office, a museum of regional studies, two factories (furniture and industrial manufacturing), and communication departments. As in much of Imereti, production of wine (and derived drinks) is a notable sector of the economy; the cognacs Ubisa and Nunisi are produced there on spring water.

Roda Antar

Roda Abdelhassan Antar (; born 12 September 1980) is a Lebanese professional football manager and former player. Formerly captain of Lebanon, Antar scored 20 goals for his country as a midfielder.
Antar started his career with Tadamon Sour, progressing through their youth system to the first-team squad where he made his debut at the age of 17. In 2001, he was loaned to Germany's Hamburger SV for two seasons, winning the DFB-Ligapokal in 2003, before moving to SC Freiburg in 2003 on a permanent deal. In 2007, he moved to 1. FC Köln, helping them gain promotion back into the Bundesliga for the 2008–09 season. In 2009, Antar moved to Chinese Super League side Shandong Luneng Taishan, where he remained for five years and won a league title in 2010; he then played for Jiangsu Sainty in 2014, and Hangzhou Greentown in 2015. Antar returned to Tadamon Sour in 2016, where he retired after one season.
Born in Sierra Leone, Antar is of Lebanese descent through his father. He represented Lebanon at international level between 1998 and 2016, playing in the 2000 AFC Asian Cup, the 2000 and 2012 WAFF Championship, and the 1998 and 2002 Arab Nations Cup. Antar also participated in the qualifiers for the 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018 FIFA World Cup tournaments.
Club career.
Tadamon Sour.
Antar, along with his older brother Faisal Antar, started his career with Lebanese Premier League side Tadamon Sour, progressing through their youth system to the first-team squad. He debuted at the age of 17 during the 1998–99 season, scoring his first goal in April in the 27th minute of a 3–1 home win against Safa. Antar scored his first goal of the 1999–00 season in round 4 in a 2–2 draw against Sagesse in October. He scored four league goals for the season, as Tadaman Sour went onto claim a runners-up position in the Lebanese Federation Cup. Antar scored his first goals for the 2000–01 season, a brace, in a 4–1 away win against Al-Ansar on 10 January. Antar finished the 2000–01 season having scored six league goals.
Hamburger SV.
Due to Antar's performances during the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in 2001, Lebanon's national team coach, Theo Bücker, had assisted him in a transfer to Bundesliga outfit Hamburger SV, on loan from Lebanese Premier League club Tadamon Sour. Antar made his first appearance in the 2001–02 Bundesliga season in a 1–1 away draw against 1860 Munich on 11 August, where Antar was substituted onto the field for Erik Meijer in the 86th minute. Antar scored his first goal in the Bundesliga in a 3–1 home win against 1. FC Nürnberg on 2 March.
During his two-year stay with the club, Hamburg would claim the 2003 German League Cup, however, after failing to establish himself with the north German side (after he played in the Regionalliga Nord for Hamburg's reserve side for the 2002–03 season), he opted for a free-transfer to SC Freiburg.
SC Freiburg.
Antar was brought to Freiburg by its first-team coach Volker Finke for the 2003–04 season. After a serious injury Antar eventually debuted in December 2003 when he scored a hat-trick in a 4–2 win against VfL Bochum. He was consequently referred to as a "Football God" by Freiburg supporters. During his time at Freiburg Youssef Mohamad, who was Roda's international teammate, was transferred to the club.
1. FC Köln.
2007–08 season.
In 2007, both Antar and Mohamad were transferred to 2. Bundesliga side 1. FC Köln for the 2007–08 season. He debuted for Köln in a 2–0 away win against FC St. Pauli on 10 August. Antar scored his first goal for Köln, a bicycle kick, in a 2–1 home victory against SV Wehen Wiesbaden on 23 March, the goal was voted as goal of the month. On 4 May 2008, Antar scored Köln's second goal in their 3–1 home victory against 1899 Hoffenheim. In the 79th minute of the match, Antar was deliberately kicked in the face by Hoffenheim midfielder Carlos Eduardo Marques, as confirmed by TV pictures. The referee, Peter Gagelmann, did not see the incident occur, however, the German FA made subsequent investigations before bringing in a charge which resulted in issuing Marques with a multi-game suspension which restricted him from playing in any competitive fixtures for the duration of the 2007–08 season. In the second last game of the 2007–08 season, Antar helped Köln gain promotion back into the Bundesliga, scoring a double in the decisive 2–0 home victory against Mainz 05 on 11 May. Antar finished the season having scored seven goals in 31 league appearances, Köln finished in third spot of the table on 60 points and were promoted to the Bundesliga for the 2008–09 Bundesliga season.
2008–09 season.
In February 2009, he left Köln after disagreements with club sporting director Michael Meier and manager Christoph Daum. The issue was subject to Antar's commitment to the first-team where which they had spoken to Antar and his adviser. The club's board of directions offered him support and individual training sessions as they felt obliged to fulfill the contractual agreement which initially ran until 30 June 2009, but no contact to him could be made after he did not turn up to the club's training sessions. Antar's agent stated that he had offers from Japan, Russia and China.
Shandong Luneng Taishan.
On 16 March 2009 Antar signed to China's Shandong Luneng Taishan for a transfer fee of £630,000 (€700,000). Antar featured in the 2010 AFC Champions League, where which Shandong were eliminated in the group stage.
On the opening day of the 2012 Chinese Super League season, Antar scored in the 32nd minute of the first half to give Shandong the lead in a 2–1 away loss against Guizhou Renhe on 10 March.
On 30 November 2012, it was reported that Chinese Super League club Beijing Guoan were observing Antar as his contract with Shandong Luneng was soon to expire and his contract was not re-newed.

In 2001, Antar scored six times for Lebanon, reaching nine international goals, where he scored once in a 3–0 friendly victory against Philippines and five more goals during the qualifiers for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Antar scored his first hat-trick for the national team during the 2002 Arab Nations Cup in a 4–2 victory against Yemen on 24 December 2002. His hat-trick brought him to a total of 12 national team goals. On 25 March 2013, Antar announced his retirement from international football citing that the constance long-distance traveling had left him physically tired and exhausted. In late October 2013, Antar announced his return to the national team. During Lebanon's last 2015 AFC Asian Cup qualification match against Thailand national football team on 5 March 2014, Antar scored Lebanon's fifth goal in their 5–2 away victory, the goal brought his tally to 19 national team goals making him the joint leading goal scorer, with Wartan Ghazarian, of the Lebanon national team.
2000 AFC Asian Cup.
Antar was selected by coach Josip Skoblar for Lebanon's 23-man squad for the 2000 Asian Cup campaign, where Antar was handed the number 20 shirt. Both Antar and his brother, Faisal had been selected for Lebanon, and Antar was also one of five under-21 players selected in the squad. Antar played in Lebanon's first group-stage match, a 4–0 loss against Iran on 12 October. Antar was substituted off of the field for Moussa Hojeij in the 65th minute. Antar then featured for Lebanon's 2–2 draw against Iraq on 15 October, when he was substituted onto the field for Michael Reda in the 47th minute. Antar then played in Lebanon's 1–1 draw against Thailand on 18 October, when he was again substituted onto the field for Jamal Taha in the 63rd minute. Lebanon were eliminated from the tournament having obtained two points, finished in bottom place of Group A.
2002 FIFA World Cup qualification.
Under German coach Theo Bücker, Antar played a vital role for Lebanon during the first round qualifiers for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, scoring five goals in five appearances. In Lebanon's opening match, he played a full 90-minutes in their 6–0 victory against Pakistan on 13 May 2001. Antar then scored a double in Lebanon's 4–0 win against Sri Lanka on 15 May 2001. Two days later, Antar scored for Lebanon in the 9th minute giving them a 1–0 lead against Thailand on 17 May 2001. Thailand scored two goals before half-time to eventually win the match 2–1. On 26 May 2001, Antar scored another double in Lebanon's 8–1 victory against Pakistan. On 30 May 2001, Antar played a full 90-minutes of Lebanon's 2–2 draw against Thailand. The result meant that Lebanon finished in second position of their respective group, with 13 points, but failed to advance to the second round of qualifiers.
2006 FIFA World Cup qualification.
Antar was named captain in 2004 for the second round qualifiers for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring three goals in four appearances. He missed Lebanon's first match against South Korea, a 2–0 loss on 18 February 2004, due to a visa problem. On 31 March 2004, Antar played in his first match of the qualification campaign, a 2–0 away victory against Vietnam, where Antar scored Lebanon's first goal of the match in the 83rd minute. On 9 June 2004, Antar scored in Lebanon's 3–0 home win against Maldives. Antar again scored for Lebanon in their 5–2 away victory against Maldives in Malé on 8 September 2004. On 13 October 2004, Antar played a full 90-minutes of Lebanon's 1–1 home draw against South Korea. The result meant that Lebanon could not proceed to the next round of qualifiers, Lebanon eventually drew 0–0 with Vietnam in Beirut on 17 November 2004 in their last qualification match and finished in second place of their respective qualification group with 11 points.
2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.
Antar featured in two 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification matches for Lebanon. They were drawn in a first round play-off against India, where Antar scored in Lebanon's 4–0 first-leg victory on 8 October 2007. Following a 2–2 draw in the second leg on 30 October 2007, Lebanon advanced to the next round of qualifiers. Antar then played a full 90-minutes of Lebanon's third round qualifier against Uzbekistan, a 1–0 home defeat on 6 February 2008. Lebanon had obtained no points out of their six group stage matches and finished in bottom place of their respective group.
2014 FIFA World Cup qualification.
Third round.
After one year of absence due to international retirement, Antar came out of retirement to play under former coach, Theo Bücker, for the AFC third round of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. Having missed Lebanon's opening group-stage match against South Korea in Goyang due to a visa problem, Antar was named captain by Bücker for his first appearance, where he helped Lebanon to a 3–1 home victory against the United Arab Emirates on 6 September 2011. Antar had assisted Akram Moghrabi in scoring Lebanon's second goal and scored the third goal himself with a header in the 83rd minute. Antar was then awarded the man of the match. During Lebanon's third group-stage match on 11 October 2011, Lebanon had drawn 2–2 with Kuwait in front of approximately 32,000 fans in Beirut. On 15 November 2011, Lebanon defeated South Korea 2–1 in Beirut. Lebanon took the lead after 4 minutes when Antar's shot was blocked and then turned in by Ali Al Saadi. Their second goal came after 30 minutes of the first half when Abbas Ali Atwi converted a penalty shot. Antar inspired Lebanon to a spirited and historic victory, recording Lebanon's first ever win over South Korea, and had been instrumental in Lebanon's last four qualifiers as they obtained ten points to share their group's top spot with the South Korea. The 2–1 result sent both teams to the fourth round of the qualifiers. It was after this win that Lebanon striker Mahmoud El Ali hailed the performance of Antar and how much his presence had helped Lebanon. Antar had received his second yellow card of the third round against South Korea and therefore did not take part in Lebanon's 4–2 away loss against the UAE on 29 February 2012.
Fourth round.
During Lebanon's fourth group-stage match of the fourth round on 11 September 2012, Antar scored in the 27th minute of the match to give Lebanon a 1–0 victory against Iran. Antar scored in the 27th minute from a header off a Mohamad Haidar free-kick, upon his return to the team, having missed the opening three games due to injury. The spirited victory not only marked Lebanon's first-ever goal but also its first-ever win against Iran, brought the Iranians' 13-match unbeaten qualifying record to an end. In October 2011, it was reported that Antar praised the Lebanon national team for their results and stated that it was the best national team in their history. He also indicated that his captaincy role was more of a job as opposed to a responsibility and that it was his duty to do his job well and try to win matches alongside his teammates.
2018 FIFA World Cup qualification.
On 12 November 2015, Antar scored his 20th international goal for Lebanon in a 7–0 home victory against Laos during a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification match. Antar celebrated the goal by showing ten fingers twice and also pointed to the number 20 on his shirt to indicate that he had achieved 20 national team goals.
During a press conference on 31 March 2016, Antar announced that he would retire from international football after Lebanon's 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Myanmar. Antar ended his international career with 20 goals in 65 appearances.

Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40

Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40), sometimes referred to as "Slick Forty," is one of two launch pads located at the Integrate-Transfer-Launch Complex in Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. It initially opened as Launch Complex 40 (LC-40) and was used by the United States Air Force alongside the neighboring Space Launch Complex 41 for the Titan III program. It initially saw use by the Titan IIIC throughout the 1960s and 1970s, before getting retrofitted for the Titan 34D during the 1980s. In the 1990s, Martin Marietta and the Air Force upgraded it to launch the Commercial Titan III, but the rocket's lack of success caused the pad to be used by the Titan IV throughout the decade and into the 2000s.
Following the Titan family's retirement, the SLC-40 lease was given to SpaceX in 2007 for use by their new rocket, the Falcon 9. Since the early 2010s, the pad has transformed into a high-volume launch site for the Falcon 9, being mainly used to service the company's Starlink megaconstellation. As of August 2025, the pad has hosted over 270 Falcon 9 launches.
In near future, SpaceX will make a new Falcon 9 landing pad within SLC40 launch complexes to eliminate use of Landing Zones 1 and 2.
History.
Titan IIIC and 34D (1965–1989).
Launch Complex 40 was originally constructed by the United States Air Force as one of two launch pads of the Integrate-Transfer-Launch Complex (ITL), tasked with launching Titan III rockets with solid rocket boosters. The ITL was similar to Launch Complex 39 at the nearby Kennedy Space Center, where Titans would get assembled at the Vertical Integration Building (demolished in 2006), have their boosters built and attached at the Solid Motor Assembly Building (now used by SpaceX to process Falcon 9 payloads), and launched from either LC-40 or Launch Complex 41 (LC-41, now SLC-41).
LC-40 hosted its inaugural launch in June 1965, a Titan IIIC rocket with a 9,500 kg (21,000 lb) mass simulator to test the Transtage upper stage. Almost every Titan IIIC launch from the pad carried a military payload, the vast majority of them being classified reconnaissance satellites. Additionally, the ITL was planned to launch the Titan IIIM for the Air Force's Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program, using it as a testing ground before the operational launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base's SLC-6 would be activated. The only MOL launch made before the program's cancellation occurred at LC-40, with OPS 0855 lifting off in November 1966 with the first capsule to be reused, Gemini SC-2 previously flown on Gemini 2.
Going into the 1970s, LC-40 became the dedicated launch site for the Titan IIIC within the ITL, as LC-41 would undergo modifications to launch the Titan IIIE. Throughout the rest of the decade, the complex would see approximately one to three Titan IIIC launches a year until the rocket's replacement with the Titan 34D in the early 1980s. Similarly to its predecessor, every Titan 34D launch from the pad was for military purposes, being used to put payloads into geostationary transfer orbit.
Commercial Titan III and Titan IV (1990–2005).
In the late 1980s, Titan manufacturer Martin Marietta and the Air Force converted the ITL to their new Titan configurations: LC-40 would be used to launch the civilian-focused Commercial Titan III, while LC-41 would be for the military-oriented Titan IV. Additionally, Titan IV processing would go through the newly built Solid Motor Assembly and Readiness Facility (now used by United Launch Alliance for assembling Atlas V and Vulcan Centaur) before launch. This setup did not last, as the Commercial Titan III's price compared to cheaper systems like Delta II and Ariane 4 limited its customer base into early retirement. That being said, a handful of notable payloads were launched from LC-40 in this era, like Intelsat 603 in March 1990 (of which a stage malfunction caused it to be visited by Space Shuttle "Endeavour" during STS-49) and the failed Mars Observer in September 1992. Following the Commercial Titan III's retirement, LC-40 was converted to complement LC-41 in the launches of the Titan IV. As was typical for the Titan family, almost all launches in the decade carried military payloads; the only exception to this was NASA and ESA's Cassini–Huygens mission to Saturn in October 1997. Going into the new millennium, the cost of Titan launches led to Lockheed Martin (who assumed the control of Titan following Martin Marietta's merger with Lockheed) winding down and announcing the retirement of the Titan family in favor of their cheaper Atlas launch vehicles. As such, the last Titan IV launches at the ITL were made from LC-40, with LC-41 and the SMARF converted to process and launch the Atlas V. Over its lifetime, LC-40 supported a total of 55 Titan launches, including 26 Titan IIICs, eight Titan 34Ds, four Commercial Titan IIIs, and 17 Titan IVs. The final Titan launch from LC-40 was the Lacrosse-5 reconnaissance satellite carried on a Titan IV-B on April 30, 2005.
Following the conclusion of Titan operations, the launch complex underwent significant transformation. The tower was dismantled in early 2008, followed by the controlled demolition of the Mobile Service Structure later that year.
SpaceX and Falcon 9 (2007–present).
SpaceX leased LC-40 from the U.S. Air Force in April 2007 to launch its Falcon 9 rocket, getting renamed to SLC-40 much like what happened to SLC-41 and SLC-37. Ground facility construction began the following year, including a rocket and payload preparation hangar and new fuel tanks. A spherical liquid oxygen tank previously used at LC-34 was purchased from NASA.
The first Falcon 9 arrived in late 2008, with the inaugural launch in June 2010 carrying a dummy payload. A Dragon spacecraft demonstration flight followed in December. Starting in 2012, SLC-40 became the primary launch site for the Dragon cargo vehicle providing provide two-way logistics to and from the International Space Station, a role previously filled by the Space Shuttle until its retirement in 2011.
To accommodate the heavier Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket, the launch pad was modified in 2013. Launch frequency gradually increased from 2014, with a mix of Dragon and satellite missions.
A catastrophic explosion occurred at SLC-40 in September 2016 during a static fire test, destroying a Falcon 9 rocket and its payload, the AMOS-6 satellite. The incident caused significant damage to the launch pad. After a thorough investigation and cleanup, repairs and upgrades began in early 2017. SLC-40 returned to service in December 2017 with the successful launch of CRS-13.
SpaceX had leased Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at the nearby Kennedy Space Center from NASA in April 2014, which allowed launches to continue to from Florida during the reconstruction of SLC-40. In August 2018, LC-39A's crew access tower received an access arm, allowing crew to be loaded onto Crew Dragon 2 capsules along with late payload changes on Cargo Dragon 2 capsules. Because SLC-40 lacked an access tower, Dragon missions were paused after the original Dragon 1 capsule was retired in 2020.In the 2020s, SLC-40 would become SpaceX's "workhorse" launch pad, hosting less complex satellite launch missions as frequently as every week, completing 50 launches of this launch pad alone in 2023. Meanwhile, LC-39A was used less, being reserved for Dragon crew and cargo flights, Falcon Heavy missions, and other complex missions.
To add additional operational flexibility and reduce reliance on LC-39A, in early 2023, SpaceX began constructing an access tower at SLC-40. In February 2024, SpaceX tested its new emergency escape system for future crewed missions, which uses an evacuation slide instead of the slidewire baskets used at LC-39A.
The tower was first used ahead of in early 2024 to accommodate late loading of supplies into cargo spacecraft. SLC-40 was used to launch its first crewed mission in September 2024, SpaceX Crew-9. The mission had been slated to use LC-39A, but was shifted to SLC-40 when the launch was delayed due to issues with the Boeing Starliner "Calypso" spacecraft that was docked to the ISS. In addition, the delay would have bled into LC-39A's conversion process into Falcon Heavy launches, as one was being used to launch NASA's Europa Clipper in October.
In near future, SpaceX will make a new Falcon 9 landing pad within SLC40 launch complexes to eliminate use of Landing Zones 1 and 2.

Long Stanton railway station

Long Stanton railway station was a station on the Great Eastern Railway, between Cambridge and Huntingdon. It served the villages of Longstanton and Willingham (being roughly midway between them), until closure in October 1970. The station was immortalised in 1964 in the song "Slow Train" by Flanders and Swann.
The railway line through Long Stanton remained open for freight trains from Cambridge to St Ives, Cambridgeshire, until 1992. The track was removed and one platform demolished in 2007, due to construction of the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway; however, the station building remains in private ownership. Parts from the platforms were preserved for re-use on the Mid-Norfolk Railway.

Tofa forms a dialect continuum with the closely related Tuvan language, and shares many features with Tuvan. Tofa is a critically endangered language, as classified by the UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, and recent estimates for speakers run from 67 to fewer than 40 individuals. Only 3 people can speak it fluently.
Classification.
Tofa is most closely related to the Tuvan language and forms a dialect continuum with it. Tuha and Tsengel Tuvan may be dialects of either Tuvan or Tofa. Tofa shares a number of features with these languages, including the preservation of *d as /d/ (as in "hodan" "hare" - compare Uzbek "quyon") and the development of low tones on historically short vowels (as in *"et" &gt; "èt" "meat, flesh").
Alexander Vovin (2017) notes that Tofa and other Siberian Turkic languages, especially Sayan Turkic, have Yeniseian loanwords.
Geographic and demographic distribution.
The Tofa, who are also known as the Tofalar or Karagas, are an indigenous people living in southwestern Irkutsk Oblast, in Russia. The region they inhabit is informally known as Tofalariya. They are traditionally a nomadic reindeer-herding people, living on or near the Eastern Sayan mountain range. However, reindeer herding has greatly declined since the 20th century, with only one Tofa family continuing the practice . Recognized by the former USSR in 1926 as one of the "Small Numbered Minorities of the North," (Russian: "коренные малочисленные народы Севера, Сибири и Дальнего Востока)" the Tofa have special legal status and receive economic support from Russia. The Tofa population is around 750 people; around 5% of the population spoke Tofa as a first language in 2002, (although that number has likely declined since then, due to the age of the speakers). Although the population of Tofalaria appears to be growing, the number of ethnic Tofalar seems to be in decline.
Effects of language contact.
Language contact—mainly with Russian speakers—has been extensive since 1926, when the Tofa officially received their "Small Numbered Minorities of the North" status from the USSR (Russian: "коренные малочисленные народы Севера, Сибири и Дальнего Востока)" and underwent significant cultural, social, and economic changes. Most notably, this traditionally nomadic, reindeer-herding people have since become sedentary and reindeer herding has all but vanished among the Tofa. In addition to visiting tax collectors and tourists, many other Russians have come to the Sayan mountain range to live. Russian migration and intermarriage also has had an effect, according to a citation by Donahoe: "In 1931, of a total population in Tofalaria of 551, approximately 420 (76%) were Tofa, and the remaining 131 (24%) were non-Tofa, predominantly Russian (Mel'nikova 1994:36 and 231). By 1970, the population in Tofalaria had increased to 1368, of whom 498 (36%) were Tofa, and 809 (59%) were Russian (Sherkhunaev 1975:23)."(p. 159) There were approximately 40 speakers of various fluency levels by 2002, and this number has likely continued to decrease in the intervening time.
Phonology.
Vowels.
The following table lists the vowels of Tofa. The data was taken from Ilgın and Rassadin.
Rassadin also indicates that Tofa has a short []. All vowels except [] can be pharyngealized []. According to Rassadin pharyngealization is realized as creaky voice []; Harrison and Anderson represent this feature as low tone.
Consonants.
The following table lists the consonants of Tofa. The data was taken from Ilgın and Rassadin.
Vowel harmony.
Many dialects of Tofa exhibit vowel harmony, although this harmony seems to be linked to fluency: as one decreases, so does the other. Tofa vowel harmony is progressive and based on two features: backness and rounding, and this occurs both root-internal and in affixes. Enclitics do not appear to trigger backness harmony, and rounding harmony in Tofa has been undergoing changes, and may apply inconsistently. In some cases this may be due to opaque rules resulting in an apparent "disharmony", especially among speakers of the younger generation. The complications surrounding Tofa vowel harmony may also be due to fluctuations from language endangerment. In general, Russian loanwords do not appear to conform to vowel harmony. Given the increasing quantity of these loanwords, leveling may also be a factor in the inconsistent application of vowel harmony.
Writing system.
Tofa, although not often written, employs a Cyrillic alphabet:
Tofa has letters that are not present in the Russian alphabet: Ғғ , Әә , Ii , Ққ , Ңң , Өө , Үү , Һһ , and Ҷҷ . Additionally, the letter ъ is sometimes used after a vowel to mark pharyngealization [ˤ], as in эът [ʔɛˤt̪] "meat".
An earlier version of the alphabet from 1988 looks like this:
Morphology and syntax.
Tofa is an agglutinative language with a few auxiliary verbs. The bare stem of a verb is only used in the singular imperative; other categories are marked by suffixation, including the singular imperative negative. The Tofa suffix /"--sig"/ is an especially unusual derivational suffix in that it attaches to any noun to add the meaning 'smelling of + [NOUN]' or 'smelling like + [NOUN]'. Grammatical number in Tofa includes singular, plural, dual inclusive ('you and me'), and plural inclusive, tense includes the present and past, and aspect includes the perfective and imperfective. Historically suffixes conformed to Tofa vowel harmony rules, but that appears to be changing. Some example sentences are included below to illustrate suffixation:
Plural Perfective
Singular Imperative
Singular Imperative Negative
Pronouns.
Tofa has six personal pronouns:
Tofa also has the pronouns бо "this", тээ "that", кум "who", and чү "what".
Vocabulary.
Tofa words are very similar to many other Turkic Languages, but not more than Tuvan. English and Russian are provided for reference.

Ranken Technical College

Ranken Technical College is a private technical school in St. Louis, Missouri. It offers programs in five main divisions: Automotive, Electrical, Construction, Information Technology, and Manufacturing. The school has a student body consisting of approximately 2,300 students.
History.
Ranken Technical College was founded in 1907 by David Ranken Jr., as a private, non-profit educational institution to train students for employment in a variety of technical and mechanical occupations. Established with a foundation deed of more than $1 million, Ranken began its first academic year in September 1909. David Ranken later added his entire fortune to the school's endowment, which, since then, has contributed to the substantial growth of the college and helped to reduce annual operating costs and tuition.
Academics.
Ranken Technical College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It offers primarily associate degrees although it also offers two bachelor degree programs.
Ranken Community Development Corporation (RCDC).
Recognizing a need for housing in the community it serves, Ranken Technical College established the Ranken Community Development Corporation (RCDC) in April 1994. Prior to establishing the RCDC, Ranken students exercised their skills through projects with community organizations such as Habitat for Humanity. As student and project schedules became more difficult to coordinate, the college began working to establish a non-profit, Ranken-run organization capable of providing affordable housing to the Central West End community.
The program combines the technical skills of its students and faculty with the need for affordable housing, enhancing North St. Louis city's neighborhoods.
Through the RCDC and their required curriculum, students receive hands-on experience in the carpentry and plumbing involved in the construction and renovation of single-family homes. The non-profit organization has built more than 50 homes to date. For each house, students and faculty members from Architectural Technology, Carpentry and Building Construction Technology, Plumbing Technology, and Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology use their skills to build houses in the neighborhood surrounding the college.
Once the houses are completed, they are sold. Proceeds are then used to build more homes and involve future students in home building projects.

Southsea, Wrexham

Southsea () is a formerly industrial village on the River Gwenfro in Broughton community, Wrexham County Borough, Wales.
The village came into being at the site of the Broughton Hall Brickworks and Plas Power Colliery. Its Welsh language placename (meaning "the bank of the river", "glan yr afon") derives from that of a farm. Its exotic-sounding English name, however, comes from the "South Sea Inn" which used to stand over the road from the brickworks, and in a room of which the brickworks pay was distributed.
The Wrexham historian Alfred Neobard Palmer noted that the name Southsea first appeared on the rate books as early as 1786, though also commenting that this was "an absurd name which should never have been adopted, especially as there was an appropriate name ready to hand".
Southsea's church, All Saints, was formerly its church hall. The previous church, built in 1921 after the original building became unsafe due to mining subsidence, itself became unsafe and was demolished in 1984.

Clewiston Inn

The Clewiston Inn (also known as The Inn) is a historic site in Clewiston, Florida, United States. It is located at U.S. 27, west of the junction with CR 832, and is the oldest hotel in the area of Lake Okeechobee. On February 21, 1991, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
History.
The Clewiston Inn was originally built along the unprotected waterfront of Lake Okeechobee in 1926 by the Clewiston Company, the community and real estate development arm of Bror Dahlberg's Southern Sugar Company. Ownership passed to the United States Sugar Corporation in 1931 when Charles Stewart Mott formed the company and acquired the assets of the Southern Sugar Company, which went into bankruptcy in 1929. The building survived the great 1926 and 1928 hurricanes but was destroyed by a fire in 1937 and the classical revival style structure was rebuilt in 1938. The Everglades Lounge and Bar inside has a 360-degree wildlife mural featuring the flora and fauna of the Florida Everglades. It was created in the early 1940s by the J. Clinton Shepherd (1888-1975). This Palm Beach artist stayed at the Inn for many months, making frequent trips to the Everglades to sketch the animals.
In 2007 the U.S. Sugar Corporation sold the Inn to Big Lake Hotels.
In 2011 the Big Lake Hotels Corporation sold the Inn to Clewiston Hospitality LLC.

Treaty of Bongaya

The Treaty of Bongaya (also spelled Bongaja) was signed on November 18, 1667, between Hasanuddin of Gowa, ruler of the Sultanate of Gowa, and the Dutch East India Company (VOC). In the midst of the Second Anglo-Dutch War Hasanuddin launched a war against the Sultanate of Ternate, but the Dutch were able to defeat his forces.
The treaty resulted in all non-Dutch Europeans being banned from Makassar. Only one of Hasanuddin's forts was allowed to continue to exist and the Dutch seized what later became Fort Rotterdam. Gowa was reduced to a vassal and its dependencies were transferred to the VOC.
Background.
Hasanuddin of Gowa, ruler of the Sultanate of Gowa, was aligned with the Kingdom of England. Dutch failures in the Second Anglo-Dutch War embolden Hasanuddin to not compromise with the Dutch. Hasanuddin sent 6,000 men against the Sultanate of Ternate and he achieved several victories against Ternate's fleet before Dutch commissioner Jan van Wesenhagen arrived to negotiate. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) declared war on Gowa on 5 October 1666, and achieved multiple victories before entering into negotiations with Hasanuddin on 19 October.
Content.
On 18 November 1667, the Treaty of Bongaya was signed between Gowa and the VOC. The Englishmen in Makassar were taken as prisoners by the Dutch. The treaty prohibited all Europeans, except the Dutch, from Makassar. Makassar's port was placed under the same Dutch monopoly present in the rest of the Dutch East Indies.
Gowa's dependicies, such as Minahasa, were transferred to the Netherlands and Gowa was reduced to a vassal of the VOC. Hasanuddin was required to destroy all of his fortresses except for the one at his royal residence in Samboepo. Jum Pandan, a stronghold that would be converted into Fort Rotterdam, was ceded to the Dutch.
A day of celebration was held in Batavia when news of the treaty reached it in March 1668.

Port of Bar

The Port of Bar (Montenegrin: "Luka Bar", "Лука Бар", MNSE: LUBA ) is Montenegro's main sea port. It is located in Bar.
The EU believes that the Port of Bar is one of the essential elements of transport, and therefore the economy of Montenegro, with almost all overseas trade goods being carried through it.
History.
The Port of Bar was used as a sea port for Shkodër before it was conquered by the Turks in 1571. Right after the conquest of Bar, the Turks constructed a small port with one breakwater and wooden pier. This former Turkish port has been maintained and expanded since 1878, when Montenegro gained Bar after becoming officially independent from Ottoman Turkey. Montenegro became the first South Slavic state to have a port to the sea.
Construction of the port formally started on March 23, 1905, when King Nikola I, on board on the yacht "Rumija", plunged a foundation stone, on which his initials and the date were carved in, into the sea. The Port of Bar officially began construction on June 27, 1906, even though the port was founded the same day. Coen Caglia, an Italian expert in maritime construction designed the port for an annual turnover of 3 million tons of cargo. Despite all the planning, only the 250 meter breakwater was constructed and put into operation on October 23, 1909.
During World War II, Germans mined and destroyed the port almost completely in 1944 while retreating. Reconstruction started in 1950, and the construction for a large port started four years later. The first phase was completed in 1965. The second phase that had in its plan an annual turnover of cca 5 million tons of cargo was almost completed, when the catastrophic earthquake struck in 1979, destroying more than half of its modern port facilities.
The reconstruction and renewal of the port's facilities started in 1981 and today's port of Bar, capable of handling cca 5 million tons of cargo, officially began operations on July 13, 1983.
According to an EU subsidy project document, it was noted in 2019 that Volujica quay had deteriorated and degraded rapidly in the previous several years. EU plans to improve connectivity include building a motorway Bar – Belgrade and the reconstruction and modernisation of the railway Bar – Belgrade.
Development plans at the port include an LNG terminal.
Operations.
The port management is split into two operators, "Port of Bar" JSC and JSC Container Terminal.
In 2022 the port was making a small profit on transhipping 2m tons p.a.

Robbie Beckett

Robbie Beckett (born July 16, 1972) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher.
Career.
In 1990, he was drafted in the first round (25th) by the San Diego Padres in the amateur draft out of McCallum High School in Austin, Texas. Starting out for the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes in the Padre's farm system, he was soon well known for his impressive 100 mph fastballs at the young age of 21. During one stretch of his stint at the Quakes, he was able to throw 88 strikeouts in 84 innings. However, Beckett's extreme fastballs were counterbalanced by his poor control. During one spring training session, veteran MLB hitters refused to go to bat against such a powerful and erratic pitch and risk injury so early in the season. Unable to make progress in the Padres farm system, the team waived Beckett on March 29, 1996. The Florida Marlins picked Beckett up but soon waived him also. After Florida, the Colorado Rockies selected Beckett off waivers. Beckett made his Major League debut with the Rockies on September 12, 1996, when he was 24 years old. Beckett was a left-handed pitcher, but batted with his right. Beckett only played in seven games (none of which he started), and was released from the Colorado Rockies on September 26, 1997.

Oflag II-C

Oflag II-C Woldenburg was a German World War II prisoner-of-war camp located about from the town of Woldenberg, Brandenburg (now Dobiegniew, western Poland). The camp housed Polish officers and orderlies and had an area of with 25 brick huts for prisoners and another six for kitchens, class-rooms, theater, and administration. Now it houses a museum.
Camp history.
Work on the camp began in October 1939 when 500 Polish prisoners from the September campaign arrived to build the camp, and who lived initially in tents. In May 1940 as the building work progressed small groups of Polish officers were transferred in from other POW camps. In July 1941 a group of officer-cadets ("podchorąży") were brought from Stalag II-A. They were divided among the 25 huts to work as orderlies, in addition to the lower ranks that were already doing this work. In April 1942 the last group of Polish officers arrived from Oflag X-C near Lübeck. The number of inmates reached its peak of 5,944 officers and 796 orderlies. In October 1944 some 100 higher-ranking officers of the underground Polish Home Army arrived after the German suppression of the Warsaw Uprising.
On 28 January 1945 the POWs were assembled and marched westward, but after two days they were liberated by the Soviet Red Army. The exception was a group of sick officers evacuated to Oflag II-A, which they reached on 17 March 1945. They were liberated there along with fellow sick Belgian officers on 27 April 1945.
Escapes.
There were several escape attempts, but only two were successful. In early 1942 three officers managed to hide inside empty boxes in a truck that was unloading food supplies. They were successful. On Christmas Eve 1942 a number of officers arranged a fight outside one of the huts. While the guards were engaged in breaking up the fight, toward which the searchlights were all directed, three officers managed to cut through the barbed wire and escape from the camp. A larger scale attempt was unsuccessful. In 1943 a tunnel was being dug from a hut closest to the wires. About 150 officers were preparing to get out through it. Unfortunately, as the tunnel was within a few metres of its end it was discovered.
In 1945, Wojciech Trojanowski escaped during the evacuation of the camp.
Cultural life.
Cultural life in the camp was very extensive. A large number of classes were conducted by the 80 officers who were professors or teachers in civilian life. These classes included philosophy and law, as well as French and English. Mathematics was taught by the architect Professor Jerzy Hryniewiecki. A number of the prisoners were able to complete full university courses which were recognized after the war.
In the theater a number of plays were presented by two professional directors - Kazimierz Rudzki and Jan Kocher. Some new plays were written, including a three-act drama called "Mały" ("The Little One") written by Andrzej Nowicki. There was also a symphony orchestra under the direction of Józef Klonowski.
In 1942 a secret radio receiver was built and the news distributed throughout the camp in newsletters. Units of the Polish Home Army from Piła and Krzyż secretly maintained contact with the POWs and the former smuggled Polish underground press into the camp.
1944 POW Olympics.
Thirteen pre-war Polish Olympics competitors were held in the camp. In the summer of 1944 the prisoners were granted permission to stage an unofficial POW Olympics from July 23 to August 13. An Olympic Flag was made with a bed sheet, and pieces of colored scarves was raised.

Leica Digilux 3

The Digilux 3 is a digital single-lens reflex camera introduced by Leica on 14 September 2006. The Digilux 3 and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-L1 are similar specification cameras, using the Four Thirds standard lens mount and featuring a 7.5 Megapixels live view N-MOS sensor, but the Digilux 3 has modified firmware including DNG output. Both the Panasonic and Digilux 3 cameras come standard with the same interchangeable Leica Elmarit 14–50 mm f/2.8–3.5 optically image-stabilized zoom lens. The Leica D system includes also the Leica Summilux 25 mm f/1.4 lens.
The two cameras share several unique features among dSLRs. One is the presence of film-camera type controls for optional control of both aperture and shutter speed. Reviews have noted the intuitive "feel" of the cameras.
Another is the built-in dual-position flash. With an initial actuation of the flash button, the flash pops up to a bounce-flash position, giving a more diffuse flash that is preferred by some photographers, especially for portrait photos. A second actuation of the button raises the flash to a forward-facing position for direct flash. 
Some of the build features are inherited from the Olympus E-330, such as the eyepiece. Spare parts, such as the EP-7 eyecup from Olympus, can be used on the Digilux 3.
The camera also includes a comprehensive software package Adobe® Photoshop® Elements® 4.0 and Quicktime movie player. Only 13,300 of these cameras were made, making it somewhat rare.

Transporter associated with antigen processing

Transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) protein complex belongs to the ATP-binding-cassette transporter family. It delivers cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they bind to nascent MHC class I molecules.
The TAP structure is formed of two proteins: TAP-1 and TAP-2, which have one hydrophobic region and one ATP-binding region each. They assemble into a heterodimer, which results in a four-domain transporter.
Function.
The TAP transporter is found in the ER lumen associated with the peptide-loading complex (PLC). This complex of β2 microglobulin, calreticulin, ERp57, TAP, tapasin, and MHC class I acts to keep hold of MHC molecules until they have been fully loaded with peptides.
Peptide transport.
TAP-mediated peptide transport is a multistep process. The peptide-binding pocket is formed by TAP-1 and TAP-2. Association with TAP is an ATP-independent event, 'in a fast bimolecular association step, peptide binds to TAP, followed by a slow isomerisation of the TAP complex'. It is suggested that the conformational change in structure triggers ATP hydrolysis and so initiates peptide transport.
Both nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are required for peptide translocation, as each NBD cannot hydrolyse ATP alone. The exact mechanism of transport is not known; however, findings indicate that ATP binding to TAP-1 is the initial step in the transport process, and that ATP bound to TAP-1 induces ATP binding in TAP-2. It has also been shown that undocking of the loaded MHC class I is linked to the transport cycle of TAP caused by signals from the TAP-1 subunit.
Transport of mRNA out of the nucleus.
Yeast protein Mex67p and human NXF1, also-called TAP, are the two best-characterized NXFs (nuclear transport factors). TAPs mediate the interaction of the messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) and the nuclear pore complex (NPC). NXFs bear no resemblance to prototypical nuclear transport receptors of the importin–exportin (karyopherin) family and lack the characteristic Ran-binding domain found in all karyopherins. 
Specificity.
The ATPase activity of TAP is highly dependent on the presence of the correct substrate, and peptide binding is prerequisite for ATP hydrolysis. This prevents waste of ATP via peptide-independent hydrolysis.
The specificity of TAP proteins was first investigated by trapping peptides in the ER using glycosylation. TAP binds to 8- to 16-residue peptides with equal affinity, while translocation is most efficient for peptides that are 8 to 12 residues long. Efficiency reduces for peptides longer than 12 residues. However, peptides with more than 40 residues were translocated, albeit with low efficiency. Peptides with low affinity for the MHC class I molecule are transported out of the ER by an efficient ATP-dependent export protein. These outlined mechanisms may represent a mechanism for ensuring that only high-affinity peptides are bound to MHC class I.

William Henry Luden (March 5, 1859 in Reading, Pennsylvania – May 8, 1949 in Atlantic City, New Jersey) was the developer of the menthol cough drop, and founder of the Luden's company and brand.
Luden launched a backroom candy business in 1879 in the rear of his father's jewelry shop at 35 N. 5th St. in Reading, Pennsylvania, his "factory" was his family's kitchen. An early product was "moshie," a Pennsylvania Dutch (German-American) candy made with brown sugar and molasses.
Luden collaborated with a pharmacist to develop a cough drop formula. He colored his cough drops amber instead of the red associated with cough drops at the time. In 1881, Luden's honey-licorice menthol throat drops were introduced. "Luden's Menthol Cough Drops" were sold for many years in 5-cent packages.
Menthol cough drops replaced the cumbersome vials of menthol that people with colds had carried to relieve their symptoms. Luden introduced new packaging methods as well, lining boxes with wax paper to extend shelf life. Perhaps his most remarkable innovation was to give samples to railroad workers, giving the product effectively national exposure in an early example of guerilla marketing.
In 1882, he moved his operations to 37 N. 5th St., and offered an extensive line, including cough drops, hard and soft candies, chocolates and marshmallow products. Luden manufactured his own chocolate for his candies unlike many confectioners of the time. In 1892 Luden moved his operations to a larger building at Sixth and Washington streets in Reading.
In 1900, he moved to still larger quarters on Eighth street beyond Walnut, where he erected a four-story brick building, expanded in 1909.
William Luden retired in 1927.
In 1928, the company was acquired by Food Industries of Philadelphia, a holding company owned by the Dietrich family. Later Luden sold his company for 6.5 million dollars. The Luden's brand has subsequently transferred ownership several times.
William Luden, age 90, died May 8, 1949, of a heart attack in Atlantic City, New Jersey, U.S. He is buried at West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

Professor Murder

Professor Murder is a dance-punk quartet from New York City that mixes synthesizers and percussion-based compositions in a method that has drawn comparison to post-punk and new wave bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s. They released their critically hailed debut EP, "Professor Murder Rides the Subway", on Kanine Records in July 2006. Members of the band are Jesse Cohen (keyboards), Andy Craven (drums), Michael Bell-Smith (vocals, percussion, bass, keys), and Tony Blankets (bass, melodica). In 2009 Bell-Smith, Cohen and Blankets joined with Eric Emm of Tanlines to create a new band, Restless People.
Name origin.
Professor Murder was a character played by the British actor and model Sam Sarpong in two comedy sketches on HBO's "Mr. Show with Bob and David" in the 1990s. He was a rapper who was featured in a sketch about the East Coast ventriloquists' feud with the West Coast ventriloquists, which mirrored the same regional divide in the world of rap music. Professor Murder made a second appearance in another sketch as a ringer brought in by the rich kids from the fat camp when they wanted to win a rapping contest against a group of Buddhist monks. It has been said that this Mr. Show character's name inspired the band's name.

Kara Musa Pasha

Kara Musa Pasha ("Musa Pasha the Courageous" in Turkish; died 1649) was an Ottoman soldier and statesman of Bosnian origin who was named grand vizier by Sultan Ibrahim 16 September 1647 after Nevesinli Salih Pasha's execution, holding the office for only five days until 21 September. He also held the office of Kapudan Pasha ("Grand Admiral of the Ottoman Navy") in 1647. He was trained in Enderûn.
Origins.
Musa Pasha was born in the Bosnian village of Vikoč, Foča in what was then the Sanjak of Herzegovina. He hailed from the Bosnian family of Vehabegović.
Life in Ottoman politics.
His first meeting with sultan Murad IV was in 1630. Later on in his life, he became a member of Sublime Porte/Divan (the Ottoman government council) and was selected three times to serve as deputy of the Budin Eyalet. There in 1643, he reportedly received an endowment for the construction of the Musa-Pasha Mosque in Nova Kasaba, Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the Crete war campaign, after the death of the previous incumbent Koca Musa Pasha, Kara Musa Pasha received the title of Kapudan Pasha in 1647. When he invaded the city of Rethymno in Crete, he had a church there converted into a mosque, which still stands as "Kara Musa Pasha Mosque." However, because of lack of many successes, he was dismissed from the role of Kapudan Pasha soon afterwards.
Also while he was fighting in the war, the imperial seal signifying his promotion to grand vizier was sent to him by sea. After having received the news of his promotion, but not having yet received the seal, he was passed over for grand vizier because of the influence of Hezarpare Ahmet Pasha over the sultan, who instead chose Hezarpare Ahmet Pasha as grand vizier.
In the beginning of the same year of 1647, he had married Şekerpare Hatun, a lady in waiting and a favorite of the sultan, which was the very reason for his appointment as Grand Admiral.
In December 1647, Kara Musa Pasha was made the governor of Baghdad Eyalet. He held this post for just over a year until January 1649, when he was dismissed and returned to Constantinople. He was executed sometime that year on the orders of queen regent Kösem Sultan, in turn upon the advice of her advisers and grand vizier.

1013 Tombecka

1013 Tombecka ("prov. designation:" "or" ) is a metallic Mitidika asteroid from the central regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 34 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 17 January 1924, by Russian-French astronomer Benjamin Jekhowsky at the Algiers Observatory in North Africa. The asteroid was named after the secretary of the Faculty of Sciences of Paris, D. Tombecka.
Orbit and classification.
"Tombecka" is a member of the Mitidika family, a small asteroid family of carbonaceous asteroids in the central main belt named after 2262 Mitidika. It has also been described generically as a stony Eunomian asteroid ().
The asteroid orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.1–3.2 AU once every 4 years and 5 months (1,606 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as at Heidelberg Observatory in October 1905. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg in 1931, approximately 7 years after its official discovery observation at Algiers.
Naming.
This minor planet was named after D. Tombeck, secretary of the Faculty of Sciences of Paris. The official naming citation was mentioned in "The Names of the Minor Planets" by Paul Herget in 1955 ().
Physical characteristics.
Spectral type.
"Tombecka" has been characterized as a metallic M-type asteroid by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). It has also been described as an Xk subtype, that transitions from the X-type to the K-type asteroids. In the Tholen classification, a determination of "Tombecka"s spectral type was inconclusive: numerical analysis of the asteroid's colors was closest to an X-type (which includes the M-type in this taxonomy), as well as in the vicinity of the C- and S-type asteroids.
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, "Tombecka" measures between 31.93 and 36.62 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.120 and 0.1552.
The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.1552 and a diameter of 31.93 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.12.
Mass and density.
"Tombecka" has a determined mass of kilograms and a high (metallic) density of 7.50 g/cm3 with no porosity at all. The results correspond to an overall mean-diameter of 35.18 kilometers.
Rotation period and poles.
In 1986, several rotational lightcurves of "Tombecka" were obtained from photometric observations. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period between 6.0 and 6.0508 hours with a brightness variation of 0.35 to 0.50 magnitude ().
In 2006, an international study modeled a lightcurve with a concurring period of 6.05017 hours and determined a spin axis of (4.0°, 62.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ,β) ().

Emanuel Hahn

Emanuel Otto Hahn (30 May 1881 – 14 February 1957) was a German-born Canadian sculptor and coin designer. He taught and later married Elizabeth Wyn Wood. He co-founded and was the first president of the Sculptors' Society of Canada.
Biography.
Education and training.
Hahn was born in Reutlingen (today a part of Baden-Württemberg, Germany) and moved to Toronto in 1888 with his family. He studied modelling and commercial design at the Toronto Technical School and Ontario College of Art as well as Industrial Design from 1899 to 1903. In 1901, he was hired by the McIntosh Marble and Granite Company where he created the bronze reliefs on various monuments. Hahn then went on to study in Stuttgart, Germany in 1903, he pursued art and design at the local school of art and design and the Polytechnical School, and briefly apprenticed in the studio of a sculptor teaching at the academy.
From 1908 to 1912 Hahn was a studio assistant to sculptor Walter Seymour Allward, helping in the construction of Allward's South African War Memorial in Toronto, the Alexander Graham Bell Telephone Memorial in Brantford Ontario, and the Baldwin-Lafontaine Monument on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. In 1912 he was hired as a modeling instructor at the Ontario College of Art, ultimately heading the sculpture department until his retirement in 1951.
He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.
Personal life.
Hahn married his former student Elizabeth Wyn Wood in 1926. The couple had one daughter and lived in Toronto at 159 Glen Road. and died in Toronto in 1957.
Career and official commissions.
After the First World War Hahn gained fame for his war memorial designs as communities sought to honour their veterans with cenotaphs and memorial sculptures. He designed a monument on the theme of a realistic soldier figure "going over the top" in Saint-Lambert, Quebec and a meditating figure of Tommy in his Greatcoat in Lindsay, Ontario. Hahn's winning proposal for the city of Winnipeg's war memorial caused a national controversy when the sculptor's German ancestry was revealed in 1925. Hahn was forced to relinquish the commission, although he was able to keep the prize money. Controversy erupted again when the competition was reopened and his wife Elizabeth Wyn Wood won the contract for the memorial. Critics condemned Wood for using her maiden name in the competition and accused her of copying her husband's design. She was also forced to withdraw from the contract and the memorial was awarded to the third-place winner.
Hahn's career was not significantly harmed, however, since he received wide press coverage, some of which condemned the city of Winnipeg because Hahn was a naturalized Canadian citizen. The following year he was awarded the contract for the Edward Hanlan monument (1926), erected on the Canadian National Exhibition grounds, and moved to the Toronto Islands in 2004. In 1929 he won the competition for a memorial to Sir Adam Beck, his most important and largest monumental project, unveiled in 1934 on University Avenue, Toronto.
Hahn was a member of The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto and served as the first President of the Sculptors' Society of Canada, which he established with Frances Loring, Florence Wyle and Elizabeth Wyn Wood in 1928. Membership in the sculptors' society permitted Hahn to exhibit smaller sculptures independently of museums and galleries.
The Ontario Heritage Foundation plaque for the South African War Memorial (Toronto) erroneously states that Walter Seymour Allward studied under Emanuel Hahn, when in fact it was the contrary.
James Saull, who constructed the Oak Bay, British Columbia Cenotaph in 1948, studied under Emanuel Hahn.
Hahn's last work is likely the Robert H. Saunders Memorial, a bas relief marker located on University Avenue south of College Street in 1957.
Coin design.
Among the coins of Canada, Hahn designed the Voyageur Dollar, which depicts a fur-trapper ("coureur de bois") from the Hudson's Bay Company and a First Nations man in a canoe with the Northern Lights in the background; the Nova Scotia racing schooner "Bluenose" on the 10¢ coin; the caribou head on the 25¢ coin; and the Canadian Parliament Buildings reverse of the 1939 royal tour of Canada silver dollar.
Portraits by other artists.
Hahn was the subject of a larger than life-size (56 cm) bust by his former student Elizabeth Bradford Holbrook entitled "Head of Emanuel Hahn". The sculpture was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada in 1962 for its permanent collection.

<doc id="6993953" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6993953" title="Immersion (mathematics)">
Immersion (mathematics)

In mathematics, an immersion is a differentiable function between differentiable manifolds whose differential pushforward is everywhere injective. Explicitly, is an immersion if
is an injective function at every point of (where denotes the tangent space of a manifold at a point in and is the derivative (pushforward) of the map at point ). Equivalently, is an immersion if its derivative has constant rank equal to the dimension of :
The function itself need not be injective, only its derivative must be.
Vs. embedding.
A related concept is that of an "embedding". A smooth embedding is an injective immersion that is also a topological embedding, so that is diffeomorphic to its image in . An immersion is precisely a local embedding – that is, for any point there is a neighbourhood, , of such that is an embedding, and conversely a local embedding is an immersion. For infinite dimensional manifolds, this is sometimes taken to be the definition of an immersion.
If is compact, an injective immersion is an embedding, but if is not compact then injective immersions need not be embeddings; compare to continuous bijections versus homeomorphisms.
Regular homotopy.
A regular homotopy between two immersions and from a manifold to a manifold is defined to be a differentiable function such that for all in the function defined by for all is an immersion, with , . A regular homotopy is thus a homotopy through immersions.
Classification.
Hassler Whitney initiated the systematic study of immersions and regular homotopies in the 1940s, proving that for every map of an -dimensional manifold to an -dimensional manifold is homotopic to an immersion, and in fact to an embedding for ; these are the Whitney immersion theorem and Whitney embedding theorem.
Stephen Smale expressed the regular homotopy classes of immersions as the homotopy groups of a certain Stiefel manifold. The sphere eversion was a particularly striking consequence.
Morris Hirsch generalized Smale's expression to a homotopy theory description of the regular homotopy classes of immersions of any -dimensional manifold in any -dimensional manifold .
The Hirsch-Smale classification of immersions was generalized by Mikhail Gromov.
Existence.
The primary obstruction to the existence of an immersion is the stable normal bundle of , as detected by its characteristic classes, notably its Stiefel–Whitney classes. That is, since is parallelizable, the pullback of its tangent bundle to is trivial; since this pullback is the direct sum of the (intrinsically defined) tangent bundle on , , which has dimension , and of the normal bundle of the immersion , which has dimension , for there to be a codimension immersion of , there must be a vector bundle of dimension , , standing in for the normal bundle , such that is trivial. Conversely, given such a bundle, an immersion of with this normal bundle is equivalent to a codimension 0 immersion of the total space of this bundle, which is an open manifold.
The stable normal bundle is the class of normal bundles plus trivial bundles, and thus if the stable normal bundle has cohomological dimension , it cannot come from an (unstable) normal bundle of dimension less than . Thus, the cohomology dimension of the stable normal bundle, as detected by its highest non-vanishing characteristic class, is an obstruction to immersions.
Since characteristic classes multiply under direct sum of vector bundles, this obstruction can be stated intrinsically in terms of the space and its tangent bundle and cohomology algebra. This obstruction was stated (in terms of the tangent bundle, not stable normal bundle) by Whitney.
For example, the Möbius strip has non-trivial tangent bundle, so it cannot immerse in codimension 0 (in ), though it embeds in codimension 1 (in ).
 showed that these characteristic classes (the Stiefel–Whitney classes of the stable normal bundle) vanish above degree , where is the number of "1" digits when is written in binary; this bound is sharp, as realized by real projective space. This gave evidence to the "immersion conjecture", namely that every -manifold could be immersed in codimension , i.e., in This conjecture was proven by .
Codimension 0.
Codimension 0 immersions are equivalently "relative" dimension 0 "submersions", and are better thought of as submersions. A codimension 0 immersion of a closed manifold is precisely a covering map, i.e., a fiber bundle with 0-dimensional (discrete) fiber. By Ehresmann's theorem and Phillips' theorem on submersions, a proper submersion of manifolds is a fiber bundle, hence codimension/relative dimension 0 immersions/submersions behave like submersions.
Further, codimension 0 immersions do not behave like other immersions, which are largely determined by the stable normal bundle: in codimension 0 one has issues of fundamental class and cover spaces. For instance, there is no codimension 0 immersion despite the circle being parallelizable, which can be proven because the line has no fundamental class, so one does not get the required map on top cohomology. Alternatively, this is by invariance of domain. Similarly, although and the 3-torus are both parallelizable, there is no immersion – any such cover would have to be ramified at some points, since the sphere is simply connected.
Another way of understanding this is that a codimension immersion of a manifold corresponds to a codimension 0 immersion of a -dimensional vector bundle, which is an "open" manifold if the codimension is greater than 0, but to a closed manifold in codimension 0 (if the original manifold is closed).
Multiple points.
A -tuple point (double, triple, etc.) of an immersion is an unordered set of distinct points with the same image . If is an -dimensional manifold and is an "n"-dimensional manifold then for an immersion in general position the set of -tuple points is an -dimensional manifold. Every embedding is an immersion without multiple points (where ). Note, however, that the converse is false: there are injective immersions that are not embeddings.
The nature of the multiple points classifies immersions; for example, immersions of a circle in the plane are classified up to regular homotopy by the number of double points.
At a key point in surgery theory it is necessary to decide if an immersion of an -sphere in a -dimensional manifold is regular homotopic to an embedding, in which case it can be killed by surgery. Wall associated to an invariant in a quotient of the fundamental group ring which counts the double points of in the universal cover of . For , is regular homotopic to an embedding if and only if by the Whitney trick.
One can study embeddings as "immersions without multiple points", since immersions are easier to classify. Thus, one can start from immersions and try to eliminate multiple points, seeing if one can do this without introducing other singularities – studying "multiple disjunctions". This was first done by André Haefliger, and this approach is fruitful in codimension 3 or more – from the point of view of surgery theory, this is "high (co)dimension", unlike codimension 2 which is the knotting dimension, as in knot theory. It is studied categorically via the "calculus of functors" by Thomas Goodwillie , John Klein, and Michael S. Weiss.
Examples and properties.
Immersed plane curves.
Immersed plane curves have a well-defined turning number, which can be defined as the total curvature divided by 2. This is invariant under regular homotopy, by the Whitney–Graustein theorem – topologically, it is the degree of the Gauss map, or equivalently the winding number of the unit tangent (which does not vanish) about the origin. Further, this is a complete set of invariants – any two plane curves with the same turning number are regular homotopic.
Every immersed plane curve lifts to an embedded space curve via separating the intersection points, which is not true in higher dimensions. With added data (which strand is on top), immersed plane curves yield knot diagrams, which are of central interest in knot theory. While immersed plane curves, up to regular homotopy, are determined by their turning number, knots have a very rich and complex structure.
Immersed surfaces in 3-space.
The study of immersed surfaces in 3-space is closely connected with the study of knotted (embedded) surfaces in 4-space, by analogy with the theory of knot diagrams (immersed plane curves (2-space) as projections of knotted curves in 3-space): given a knotted surface in 4-space, one can project it to an immersed surface in 3-space, and conversely, given an immersed surface in 3-space, one may ask if it lifts to 4-space – is it the projection of a knotted surface in 4-space? This allows one to relate questions about these objects.
A basic result, in contrast to the case of plane curves, is that not every immersed surface lifts to a knotted surface. In some cases the obstruction is 2-torsion, such as in "Koschorke's example ", which is an immersed surface (formed from 3 Möbius bands, with a triple point) that does not lift to a knotted surface, but it has a double cover that does lift. A detailed analysis is given in , while a more recent survey is given in .
Generalizations.
A far-reaching generalization of immersion theory is the homotopy principle:
one may consider the immersion condition (the rank of the derivative is always ) as a partial differential relation (PDR), as it can be stated in terms of the partial derivatives of the function. Then Smale–Hirsch immersion theory is the result that this reduces to homotopy theory, and the homotopy principle gives general conditions and reasons for PDRs to reduce to homotopy theory.

Mike Gibbons (boxer)

Michael J. Gibbons (July 20, 1887 – August 31, 1956) was an American boxer from 1908 to 1922. The brother of heavyweight Tommy Gibbons, he claimed Middleweight Champion of the World status in 1909 following Stanley Ketchel's murder. Although he never won the title, Gibbons is regarded as one of the all-time best welter and middleweight boxers by historians. Statistical boxing website BoxRec lists Gibbons as the #18 ranked middleweight of all time, while "The Ring Magazine" founder Nat Fleischer placed him at #9. The International Boxing Research Organization rates Gibbons as the 17th best middleweight ever and boxing historian Bert Sugar placed him 92nd in his Top 100 Fighters catalogue. Gibbons retired due to deteriorating vision. Following his boxing career he entered business in his native St. Paul, and became a member of the Minnesota Athletic Commission. Gibbons was elected to the Ring Magazine Hall of Fame in 1958, the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992, the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1997, and the Minnesota Boxing Hall of Fame in 2010.

RAF Wormingford

Royal Air Force Wormingford, or more simply RAF Wormingford, is a former Royal Air Force station located northwest of Colchester, Essex, England.
During World War I Wormingford was a landing ground designated for use by aircraft operating against Zeppelins. Reopened as a military airfield in 1942, it was used by both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). During the war it was used primarily as a fighter airfield. After the war, it was returned to agriculture.
Today, the main runway is used by the Essex and Suffolk Gliding Club, although the concrete has been removed except where the old NW-SE runway crosses.
History.
First World War.
The landing ground was used by the 37th Home Defence Squadron and a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.12 based here shot down Zeppelin number L.48 on 16/17 June 1917. The landing ground was known as RFC Wormingford.
Second World War.
Wormingford was originally earmarked for an Eighth Heavy Bomb Group, being built by Richard Costain Ltd. and helped by a number of sub-contractors during the period 1942/1943. The airfield had a 2,000-yard main runway on an E-W axis and two intersecting runways of 1,400 yards each along with the USAAF standard fifty hardstands, two T2 hangars, one each side of the airfield, Mark II lighting and temporary building accommodation for 2,900 personnel. The technical area was on the southern side of the airfield and the camp sites dispersed to the south and east in and around the village of Fordham.
However, Wormingford was surplus to Eighth Air Force requirements as a heavy bomber airfield and it was used instead as a fighter airfield although initially the Ninth Air Force used the airfield.
USAAF use.
The airfield was assigned USAAF designation Station 159.
362nd Fighter Group.
The 362nd Fighter Group (362nd FG) arrived at Wormingford from Mitchel Field, New York as part of the Ninth Air Force on 30 November 1943 with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts.
The group consisted of the following squadrons:
The 362nd FG flew its first mission, escorting Consolidated B-24 Liberators that attacked V-weapon launching sites near the Pas de Calais on 8 February 1944. Until April 1944 the group engaged chiefly in escorting Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress/B-24 bombers that struck factories, railways, airfields, and other targets on the Continent. The group repeatedly attacked communications in northern France and in Belgium during Apr and May, in preparation for the invasion of Normandy.
The group moved to RAF Headcorn in Kent on 13 April 1944.
55th Fighter Group.
The 55th Fighter Group moved to Wormingford on 16 April 1944. The 55th was under the command of the 66th Fighter Wing of the VIII Fighter Command. Aircraft of the 55th were identified by a green/yellow chequerboard pattern around their cowling.
The group consisted of the following squadrons:
Originally flying Lockheed P-38 Lightnings, then converting to North American P-51 Mustangs in July the group attacked gun emplacements during the Saint-Lô breakthrough in July 1944, and transportation facilities during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945. The group also patrolled the air over the English Channel and bombed bridges in the Tours area during the invasion of the Continent in June 1944. The unit patrolled the Arnhem sector to support the airborne invasion of the Netherlands in September 1944 along with strafing trucks, locomotives, and oil depots near Wesel when the Allies crossed the Rhine in March 1945.
The unit received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for eight missions to Germany between 3 and 13 September 1944 when the group not only destroyed enemy fighters in the air to protect the bombers it was escorting, but also descended to low levels, in spite of intense anti-aircraft fire, to strafe airfields and to destroy enemy aircraft on the ground. They received a second DUC for operations on 19 February 1945 when the organisation flew a sweep over Germany to hit railway tracks, locomotives, oil cars, goods wagons, troop cars, buildings, and military vehicles. The 55th flew their last combat mission on 21 April 1945.
The 55th Fighter Group moved to Kaufbeuren, Germany on 22 July 1945 as part of the occupation forces. It was assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe. While on occupation duty, the group trained with P-51 and Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star aircraft. Inactivated in Germany on 20 August 1946.
Legacy
The United States Air Force 55th Wing in various designations, has been a front-line unit of Strategic Air Command and Air Combat Command more than 50 years.
The 55th Reconnaissance Group (Very Long Range, Mapping). was activated in 1948 and assigned to Strategic Air Command. Aircraft included RB-17's and Boeing B-29 Superfortresses and RB-29's. The USAF 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing was activated in 1950, and was bestowed the lineage, honors and history of the World War II USAAF 55th Fighter Group in 1952.
The 55th Wing is currently at Offut AFB, Nebraska.
3d Scouting Force.
In September 1944, the 3d Scouting Force (originally 3rd Air Division Scouting Force) was activated at Wormingford. The unit flew a combination of P-47s, P-51s and B-17s on classified missions such as scouting target visibility and reporting meteorological conditions. The unit was inactivated during June 1945.
Royal Air Force use.
After V-E Day Wormingford was turned over to RAF Technical Training Command and later to RAF Transport Command. Later it was transferred to other government departments until being sold off between 1960 and 1962.
Current use.
With the end of military control, Wormingford was largely returned to agriculture and much of the concrete broken up for aggregate. A small section of the main runway was retained and the whole of the main runway, largely grass, is now used by the Essex and Suffolk Gliding Club. In September 2026 the lease on the club’s historic airfield will expire and the club is currently seeking a new location.

1014 Semphyra

1014 Semphyra, provisional designation , is a background asteroid from the central regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 17 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 29 January 1924, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named after the character "Semphyra" in a poem by Aleksandr Pushkin. (Zemfira, "The Gypsies")
Orbit and classification.
"Semphyra" has not been associated with any known asteroid family. It orbits the Sun in the central main belt at a distance of 2.2–3.4 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,714 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic.
The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Heidelberg.
Physical characteristics.
In the SMASS classification, "Semphyra" is an Xe-subtype that transitions from the X-type to the bright E-type asteroids, while the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer characterizes it as a dark P-type.
Rotation period.
In February 2004, a rotational lightcurve of "Semphyra" was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Donald Pray at the Carbuncle Hill Observatory, Rhode Island (). The observations were made at a low phase angle of 1.6–2.9°. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 5.636 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.12 magnitude (), indicating that the body has a rather spheroidal shape.
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE, "Semphyra" measures between 14.89 and 17.487 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.083 and 0.12.
The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 23.21 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.9.
Naming.
This minor planet was named after the character "Semphyra" in a poem by Russian Aleksandr Pushkin (1799–1837), who was directly honored with the naming of . The asteroid's official name was proposed by N. Komendantov () and mentioned in "The Names of the Minor Planets" by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

Paquita la del Barrio

Francisca Viveros Barradas (April 2, 1947 – February 17, 2025), known professionally as Paquita la del Barrio, was a Mexican singer. She was a Grammy-nominated performer of rancheras, boleros and other traditional and contemporary Mexican musical genres. 
Her songs were often characterized as a female empowering against Mexico's sexist and "macho" male culture and as criticizing Latino men for causing problems in relationships. This theme was present in some of her most notable songs, such as "Rata de dos patas", "Me saludas a la tuya" and "Tres veces te engañé", which became feminist anthems in Mexico.
In 2021, Paquita was honored with the "Billboard" Latin Music Lifetime Achievement Award.
Career.
Paquita started her career in Mexico City in 1970, where she performed at a local restaurant in the Colonia Guerrero, and fans began returning every week to listen to her sing. It is here where she started using her stage name, "Paquita la del Barrio". In the early 1980s, she opened her own restaurant-bar, Casa Paquita, in the Colonia Guerrero, where she performed regularly until it was shut by Cuauhtémoc borough authorities in 2006.
Her big break came in 1986, after she performed on a Televisa show that exposed her to a wider audience; this led to a recording contract with Discos Musart.
Songs in Paquita's catalogue usually took a feminist stance against Mexico's sexist and "macho" male culture rooted in society, often pointing the finger at the men in her life in lyrics for causing problems in relationships, and generally making them out to be "tontos y bobos" (clowns and fools). This theme was present in some of her most notable songs, including "", "Me saludas a la tuya" and "Tres veces te engañé". This made her especially popular among female audiences. Paquita also was known for her somewhat condescending way of speaking, and for her confrontational presence; her signature phrase was "¿Me estás oyendo, inútil?", or "are you listening to me, you good-for-nothing?" ("inútil" literally translates to "useless"), used in her hit "Rata de dos patas" (translates to "Two-Legged Rat"). At the 2021 Billboard Music Awards, when reguetonero and singer Bad Bunny went to the stage—to kindly help her with her faulty microphone—she (lovingly) told him, "Eres un inútil".
In an interview in 2008, with the "Miami Herald", Paquita said, "I am defending women. It is very important. I am a woman. I speak of my experiences." Her best-known song is "Rata de dos patas" (English: "Two-legged rat"), in which she compares an ex-lover to a variety of vermin and other untrustworthy animals, including bugs and "goddamn cockroaches". The song is the title track on her album of the same name. Many of Paquita's albums and songs are popular jukebox staples in Mexican clubs and cantinas. Paquita's influences stemmed from ranchera music, and singers such as Antonio Aguilar and Pedro Infante. 
Paquita duetted with singer Ricardo Arjona on "Ni tú ni yo" on his album "5to Piso" (2008). She also performed at the Premios Lo Nuestro and the Latin Grammy Awards. Paquita participated in the multi-artist 2010 Haiti earthquake benefit, lending her vocals to "Somos El Mundo", the Spanish version of "We Are The World", produced and organized by Emilio Estefan.
In 2017, Imagen Televisión and Sony Pictures Television jointly produced a series based on her life. The production, "Paquita la del Barrio", presents a fictionalized version of the singer's life story. Paquita stated that it was difficult to watch a story of her life, but was pleased that her story was being told.
Political career.
In the 2021 state elections, she ran for a seat in the Congress of Veracruz, representing the Citizens' Movement party. She contended for the Misantla local electoral district, where she placed fifth with 13,284 votes. It was her only venture into politics.
Personal life and death.
Paquita la del Barrio was born Francisca Viveros Barradas in Alto Lucero, Veracruz. When she was fifteen years old she eloped with 44-year-old Miguel Gerardo. Her marriage with Gerardo lasted seven years, and she had two sons: Iván Miguel (1968) and Javier (1969). Her first marriage ended when she discovered her husband was married to another woman and had a family. Her second marriage started in 1970s and ended 31 years later with her husband's death in 2001, with whom she had three children: twins who were born on December 26, 1977, and died three days later, on December 29. Her mother died on 11 December from a cancer. In 1979, they adopted Martha Elena, who is Paquita's niece.
In 2022, she was hospitalized for pulmonary thrombosis, which affected her mobility and caused her to limit her appearances. She also experienced health complications due to her diabetes.
Paquita died at her home in Xalapa, Veracruz, on February 17, 2025, at the age of 77.
Controversy.
The singer was criticized by the LGBTQ community when she said, in a 2010 interview, "It is better for orphans to die than to be adopted by a homosexual family." Following the backlash, she apologized to the LGBTQ community and gave a special performance and a press conference at a gay club called Spartacus Disco.

National Firearms Association

The National Firearms Association (NFA; ) is a Canadian non-profit association based in Edmonton. Its main goals are the repeal and replacement of the Firearms Act (Bill C-68), which was introduced into Canadian Parliament in 1995 (Now called "Chapter 39 of the 1995 Statutes of Canada"), the promotion of marksmanship and firearm safety and the protection of the right to hunt, and self-defence and property rights.
The NFA is a registered United Nations non-governmental organization (NGO) with special consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). It publishes "Canadian Firearms Journal", .
The NFA was faced with a hostile takeover attempt in 2015. Several lawsuits ensued, with the NFA's incumbent leadership succeeding in retaining power at their Annual General Meeting.
Controversy.
The NFA was criticized for its media release after the occurrence of a shooting spree that left three RCMP officers dead and two others wounded in Moncton, New Brunswick of June 5, 2014. Their statement read, "Incidents like these demonstrate...that none of Canada's firearms control efforts over the past 50 years have had any effect on preventing violence, or otherwise stopping bad people from carrying out their evil deeds... The excessive rules in place do not in any way increase public safety, but merely contribute to an expensive and unnecessary regime which harms only those of lawful intent." The release was perceived by some to be insensitive and politically motivated. The NFA stood by their statement claiming that they were responding to the calls for tighter gun control that people on social media and in government were making.
In late March 2015 the NFA pulled out of a committee looking at the Canadian government's proposed anti-terrorism legislation Bill C-51.
