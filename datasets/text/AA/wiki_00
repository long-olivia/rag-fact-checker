The Rake's Progress (film)

The Rake's Progress (U.S. title Notorious Gentleman) is a 1945 British comedy-drama film directed by Sidney Gilliat and starring Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer. It was written by Frank Launder, Gilliat and Val Valentine.
Plot.
The plot follows the career of upper-class cad Vivian Kenway. He is sent down from Oxford University for placing a chamber pot on the Martyrs' Memorial. Sent to South America after his father pulls a favour from a friend, he is fired for heckling the managing director while drunk.
A friend offers him a job, but he responds by seducing his wife and is found out. His jobs decline, as he moves from employment as racing driver to shop assistant to dancing partner. He lives a life of womanising and heavy drinking and constantly runs up large debts, which his family has to pay. One girl tries to kill herself. Driving while drunk and taking risks, he crashes and causes the death of his father, Colonel Kenway. Kenway is eaten up by guilt in consequence. Another girl tries to rescue him.
The plot diverges from the theme of the "Rake's Progress" paintings by having him redeem himself by a hero's death in World War II.
Production.
Sidney Gilliat says the idea for the film came entirely from Val Valentine: "he thought of it on the bus." He also says Harrison never suggested Lili Palmer for the female lead, which came from Frank Launder.
Release.
The film caused controversy with U.S. censors of the time, who trimmed scenes for what was considered graphic amoral and sexual content.
Critical reception.
"The Monthly Film Bulletin" wrote: "This smooth essay in sophisticated satire blunts its point by concessions to the romantic hero principle, in condoning the rake's mean weaknesses and granting the expiation of self-sacrificial death. But its script shows a lively imaginativeness, while thoughtful preparatory work in camera angling and inventive handling of the camera on the floor combine with concise editing to maintain speed without haste. With his usual polish, Harrison conveys the half-unconscious cynicism of the rake's selfishness and in a good supporting cast Griffith Jones and newcomer Margaret Johnston give notable minor portraits."
"Kine Weekly" wrote: "The story, with its crowded surface action, skilfully worked into a "headline " history of the recent years, is packed with rich, colourful and thoughtful entertainment. The hero's despairing attempt to make something of himself in South America and his gallant end in action are but thin coats of whitewash, yet they are sufficient to give a human touch to the composite and showmanlike portrait. Women will enjoy the film hugely, and so, for that matter, will all men."
"The New York Times" described the film as "an oddly deceptive affair which taxes precise classification. It plays like a comedy-romance, but all the way through it keeps switching with brutal abruptness to the sharpest irony ... As a consequence, a curious unevenness of emphasis and mood prevails, and initial sympathy with the hero is frequently and painfully upset." 
"TV Guide" wrote, "the film is filled with wit and style. It does not treat its unattractive subject with sympathy, yet remains sensitive and touching."

Scolomys ucayalensis

Scolomys ucayalensis, also known as the long-nosed scolomys or Ucayali spiny mouse is a nocturnal rodent species from South America. It is part of the genus "Scolomys" within the tribe Oryzomyini. It is found in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru in various different habitats in the Amazon rainforest.
Description.
"Scolomys ucayalensis" has a head-and-body length of between and a tail around 83% of this. The head is small but broad with a pointed snout and small rounded ears. The fur is a mixture of fine hairs and thicker, flattened spines. The dorsal surface is some shade of reddish-brown to reddish-black, sometimes grizzled or streaked with black, and the underparts are grey. The tail is nearly naked, and the hind feet are small but broad. The hypothenar pad (next to the outer digit on the sole of the foot) is either absent or reduced in size on the hind feet, and this contrasts with the otherwise similar "Scolomys melanops " which has well-developed hypothenar pads. The karyotype of "S. ucayalensis" has 2n = 50 and FN = 68, while that of "S. melanops" has 2n = 60, FN = 78.
Distribution and habitat.
"S. ucayalensis" is found on the eastern side of the Andes in South America. Its range extends from southern Colombia and southern Ecuador, through western Brazil to northern Peru, and completely surrounds the range of "S. melanops". Its habitat varies, with specimens being found in primary terra firme (non-flooded) lowland humid forest in Brazil, in undergrowth growing where primary forest had been cut back, and in cloud forest where the trees are clad in mosses and bromeliads. Its altitudinal range is between .

Bindery

Bindery refers to a studio, workshop or factory where sheets of (usually) paper are fastened together to make books, but also where gold and other decorative elements are added to the exterior of books, where boxes or slipcases for books are made and where the restoration of books is carried out.
Overview.
A large traditional hand bookbinding studio or workshop may be divided into areas for different tasks such as sewing, rounding and backing the spine, attaching the boards to the book and covering the book with cloth or leather. These processes are collectively called forwarding and would be carried out in the forwarding department. This area of the bindery would typically have equipment such as sewing frames, guillotines, board choppers for cutting boards used as covers, laying presses for holding books when being worked on and nipping presses for flattening paper, board, etc. 
Recently, some compact material have been developed, allowing the processing of almost all the operations.
The process of decorating or titling a book with gold or other metals, and/or different colored pieces of leather, is called finishing and is carried out in the finishing room or department. In a hand bookbindery this area would house the dozens or hundreds of brass hand tools that are used to impress gold patterns and figures onto leather one at a time, as well as the finishing stoves needed to heat these tools. In a more modern or commercial bindery, many decorative elements or letters are stamped onto a book's cover or case at the same time by use of a hot press.
Modern, commercial, bookbinding outfits range in size from the local "copy shop" book binder, using techniques such as coil binding, comb binding and velo binding to factories producing tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of volumes a day using such processes as perfect binding, saddle wire binding, and case binding. The term, bindery, especially in copy and print shops, has expanded to include other forms of paper finishing, such as paper drilling, lamination, and foamcore mounting.

Master of Crossbowmen

The Master of Crossbowmen () or more precisely, Master of Arbalesters or Master of Archers was the title of a commander of the Infantry of the French army (the "host") in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The position was an honorific title, not a military rank, created by Louis IX. The position existed until the reign of François I, when its duties were transferred to the Grand Master of Artillery.
The Master of the Crossbowmen commanded all archers (longbow, arbalest, crossbow, etc.), engineers and workers on siege engines, sappers ("sapeurs") and miners for mining fortifications during siege warfare. He was under the command of the Constable of France and the Marshals. Under his command was the Master of Artillery, who would come to more prominence in the reign of Louis XI, with the increased use of artillery.
The office is often considered one of the Great Officers of the Crown of France.

Pseudoryzomys

Pseudoryzomys simplex, also known as the Brazilian false rice rat or false oryzomys, is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae from south-central South America. It is found in lowland palm savanna and thorn scrub habitats. It is a medium-sized species, weighing about , with gray–brown fur, long and narrow hindfeet, and a tail that is about as long as the head and body. The IUCN has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern, although almost nothing is known about its diet or reproduction.
The only species in the genus Pseudoryzomys, its closest living relatives are the large rats "Holochilus" and "Lundomys", which are semiaquatic, spending much of their time in the water. The three genera share several characters, including specializations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle, such as the presence of membranes between the digits (interdigital webbing), and a reduction in the complexity of the molar crowns, both of which are at incipient stages in "Pseudoryzomys". Together, they form a unique assemblage within the oryzomyine tribe, a very diverse group including over one hundred species, mainly in South America. This tribe is part of the subfamily Sigmodontinae and family Cricetidae, which include many more species, mainly from Eurasia and the Americas. "Pseudoryzomys simplex" was independently described in 1888 on the basis of subfossil cave specimens from Brazil (as "Hesperomys simplex"); and in 1921 on the basis of a live specimen from Paraguay (as "Oryzomys wavrini"). This was confirmed in 1991 that both names pertained to the same species.
Taxonomy.
Discovery and recognition.
"Pseudoryzomys simplex" has had a complex taxonomic history. It was first described in 1888 by Danish zoologist Herluf Winge, who reviewed the materials Peter Wilhem Lund had collected in the caves of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Winge described the species as "Hesperomys simplex", and placed it in the same genus ("Hesperomys") as the species now called "Lundomys molitor" and two species now placed in "Calomys". Like most other species Winge proposed, "H. simplex" was mostly ignored in the systematic literature, but from 1952 it was used briefly, in the combination "Oecomys simplex", for an "Oecomys" species from central Brazil. In his 1960 review of "Oecomys", Field Museum mammalogist Philip Hershkovitz denied any affinities between "simplex" and "Oecomys", noting that various features of the "H. simplex" skull illustrated by Winge instead suggested affinities to the phyllotine or sigmodont groups.
In 1921, renowned British mammalogist Oldfield Thomas described "Oryzomys wavrini" as a new species of "Oryzomys" from Paraguay. In the next decades, it was viewed as an aberrant species of "Oryzomys" (then used in a much broader sense than now), but it was moved to a separate genus, named "Pseudoryzomys", by Hershkovitz in 1959, who noted that although it is similar to "Oryzomys palustris" in appearance, other features suggest it is more closely related to "Phyllotis". Thus, he viewed the animal as a member of the phyllotine group of rodents, which includes "Calomys" and "Phyllotis", not of the oryzomyine group, which includes "Oryzomys", and his opinion was mostly accepted in the next few decades. Scientific knowledge of the rare "Pseudoryzomys wavrini"—only three specimens were known when Hershkovitz described the genus "Pseudoryzomys" in 1959—increased in the following years, and in 1975 the Bolivian population was named as a separate subspecies, "Pseudoryzomys wavrini reigi", because Bolivian animals are slightly larger and darker than those from Paraguay.
In 1980, Argentinean zoologist Elio Massoia suggested that Winge's "Hesperomys simplex" and the living "Pseudoryzomys wavrini" are in fact the same species. In a 1991 study, American zoologists Voss and Myers confirmed this suggestion after re-examining Winge's material, finding no appreciable differences among specimens of "H. simplex" and "P. wavrini". Since then, the species has been known as "Pseudoryzomys simplex" (Winge, 1888), because "simplex" is the oldest specific name for the animal; "Oryzomys wavrini" Thomas, 1921, and "Pseudoryzomys wavrini reigi" Pine and Wetzel, 1975, are junior synonyms. Voss and Myers also re-evaluated the relationships of "Pseudoryzomys"; they considered it closer to oryzomyines than to phyllotines, but declined to formally place it in Oryzomyini in the absence of explicit phylogenetic justification for such a placement.
Oryzomyine relationships.
When Voss and Carleton formally characterized Oryzomyini two years later, they did place "Pseudoryzomys" in the group, even though it lacks complete mesoloph(id)s. The mesoloph is an accessory crest on the upper molars and the mesolophid is the corresponding structure on the lower molars. Only a few other animals now considered oryzomyines lack complete mesoloph(id)s, but they are absent in various non-oryzomyines, some of which had previously been regarded as close relatives of the oryzomyines that lack them. Oryzomyines with and without complete mesoloph(id)s share various other characters, however, including presence of mammae on the chest, absence of a gall bladder, and some characters of the skull, suggesting that they form one natural, monophyletic group. Oryzomyini is now one of several tribes recognized within the subfamily Sigmodontinae, which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and into southern North America. Sigmodontinae itself is the largest subfamily of the family Cricetidae, other members of which include voles, lemmings, hamsters, and deermice, all mainly from Eurasia and North America.
Several phylogenetic studies published during the 1990s and 2000s supported a close relationship between "Pseudoryzomys" and two other oryzomyines with reduced or absent mesoloph(id)s, "Lundomys" and "Holochilus". The extinct genera "Noronhomys" and "Carletonomys", described in 1999 and 2008 respectively, were also recognized as members of the group. In 2006, a broad morphological and molecular phylogenetic study of Oryzomyini provided further support for the relationship between "Holochilus", "Lundomys", and "Pseudoryzomys". Within this group, morphological data supported a closer relationship between "Holochilus" and "Lundomys" to the exclusion of "Pseudoryzomys", but DNA sequence data favored a clustering between "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys" to the exclusion of "Lundomys"; among all oryzomyines, this was the only case where relationships which received strong support from morphological and DNA sequence data conflicted. Together, the three genera form part of a large group of oryzomyines ("clade D"), which contains tens of other species. Several of those display some adaptations to life in the water, being partially aquatic, as do "Pseudoryzomys" and its relatives. Morphological data indicate that the genus "Oryzomys" is the closest relative of the group that includes "Pseudoryzomys", but DNA sequence data from the nuclear IRBP gene did not support this relationship; convergent adaptations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle may explain the morphological support for a relation between "Oryzomys" and the other three genera.
Description.
"Pseudoryzomys simplex" is a nondescript, medium-sized rat with long, soft fur. The upperparts are gray–brown and the underparts are buff; the color changes gradually over the body. The small ears are covered with short hairs. The tail is as long as or slightly longer than the head and body, and is dark above and light below. Despite the presence of short hairs, the scales on the tail are clearly visible. The hairs on the feet are pale. The hindfeet are long and narrow and have five toes, the first and fifth of which are short. Webbing is present between the second, third, and fourth toes, but the membranes are not as large as in "Lundomys" or "Holochilus". The tufts of hair on the toes and several of the pads are reduced, other common characteristics of semiaquatic oryzomyines. The head-body length is , tail length , hindfeet length , ear length and body mass .
The female has four pairs of teats, including one on the chest and three on the belly, and the gall bladder is absent, both important characters of Oryzomyini. As is characteristic of Sigmodontinae, "Pseudoryzomys" has a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) displaying large protuberances at the sides. In the cartilaginous part of the baculum, the central digit is smaller than those at the sides.
Skull.
The skull, which is short at the front, shows some typical oryzomyine characters. The palate is long, extending past the molars and the maxillary bones. The alisphenoid strut, which in some sigmodontines separates two foramina (openings) in the skull, is absent. The squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process contacting the tegmen tympani, the roof the tympanic cavity. The front part is short.
The nasal bones end bluntly close to the hindmost extent of the premaxillary bones. The narrow interorbital region, located between the eyes, converges towards the front and is flanked by low beads. The interparietal bone, located in the roof of the skull on the braincase, is nearly as wide as the frontals, but does not reach the squamosals.
The incisive foramina, which perforate the palate between the incisors and the molars, are long and narrow, extending between the first molars. The back margins of the zygomatic plates, the flattened front portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives "Lundomys" and "Holochilus", "Pseudoryzomys" has spinous processes on its zygomatic plates. These genera also share relatively simple posterolateral palatal pits, perforations of the palate near the third molar. Unlike "Holochilus" and "Lundomys", however, "Pseudoryzomys" has a flat palate, lacking a ridge on the middle that extends along the length of the palate. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the third molars, are excavated beyond the level of the palate, but not as deeply as in "Holochilus" and "Lundomys". The mastoid skull bone contains a conspicuous opening, as in most oryzomyines.
The mandible (lower jaw) is short and deep. The mental foramen, an opening at the front of the mandible, just before the first molar, opens to the side. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, is well developed. The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their front edges, which are located below the first molar.
Molars.
As in all oryzomyines except "Holochilus" and its close relatives, the molars are brachyodont, low-crowned, and bunodont, with the cusps extending higher than the central parts of the molars. They are characterized by strong cusps and absence or reduction of accessory crests. The cusps of the upper molars are opposite, but in the lower molars the labial (outer) cusps are slightly further to the front than the lingual (inner) ones. On the upper first molar, one accessory ridge, the anteroloph, is lacking, but another, the mesoloph, is present. Unlike in most other oryzomyines, however, which have mesolophs reaching the labial margin of the molar, the mesolophs of "Pseudoryzomys" are short and protrude only slightly from the middle of the molar. The corresponding structure in the lower molars, the mesolophid, is completely absent. The hindmost valley between cusps on the lower first molar, the posteroflexid, is severely reduced, foreshadowing its loss in "Lundomys" and "Holochilus". A number of molar traits support "Pseudoryzomys"s relationship with "Holochilus" and "Lundomys", forming steps in the transition from the complex, low-crowned generalized oryzomyine molar pattern to the simpler, high-crowned pattern of "Holochilus".
As in all oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar in "Pseudoryzomys" and some other species has another labial root. The first lower molar has large roots at the front and back of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two roots at the front, one labial and one lingual, and another at the back.
Postcranial skeleton.
"Pseudoryzomys" has 19 or 20 thoracic (chest) and lumbar vertebrae, 13 of which bear ribs, as is characteristic of oryzomyines. The first ribs contact both the seventh cervical (neck) vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra, an important character of the Sigmodontinae. Unlike in most sigmodontines, including "Holochilus" and "Lundomys", the fourth lumbar vertebra lacks the processes known as anapophyses. There are three or four sacral and about 29 caudal (tail) vertebrae. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, separate bones called hemal arches are present. These display a spinous process at the back, as in both "Holochilus" and "Lundomys". On the humerus, the upper arm bone, the entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; in some other cricetids, it perforates the far (distal) end of the humerus.
Karyotype.
The karyotype generally includes 56 chromosomes with a total of 54 major arms (2n = 56, FN = 54) in specimens from both Bolivia and Brazil; a poorly prepared Paraguayan specimen seems to have a similar karyotype. In this karyotype, all autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are acrocentric (with one arm so short as to be almost invisible). However, in two specimens from the Brazilian states of Tocantins and São Paulo, one pair of autosomes contains both an acrocentric and a metacentric chromosome (with two equally long arms), yielding an FN of 55. One arm of the metacentric chromosome consists entirely of heterochromatin. Apparently, a whole heterochromatic arm was added to this chromosome; cases of similar variation are known from the rodents "Peromyscus", "Clyomys", and "Thaptomys". Both sex chromosomes are acrocentric, and X is larger than Y. In addition to heterochromatin near the centromere, the Y chromosome contains two large blocks of heterochromatin on its long arm. The karyotype is closely similar to that of "Holochilus brasiliensis".
Distribution, ecology, and variation.
"Pseudoryzomys simplex" is known from northeastern Argentina, probably south to about 30°S, northward through western Paraguay to eastern Bolivia and from there eastward through Brazil in the states of Mato Grosso, Goiás, Tocantins, Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Bahia, and far in the northeast, Alagoas and Pernambuco. Paraguayan animals are somewhat smaller than those from Bolivia and Brazil and those from Bolivia have darker fur than Paraguayan specimens, but these differences are not considered significant enough to recognize subspecies. Certain bats show a similar pattern of variation: they are smaller and paler in the Chaco region, which includes much of Paraguay. Two specimens from Paraguay, collected apart, differed by 1.4% in the sequence of the cytochrome "b" gene, but nothing is known about genetic variation in other parts of the range. The species has long been rare in collections; in 1991, Voss and Myers could use less than 50 specimens for their study of the species, including Lund's fragmentary material from Lagoa Santa.
A fragmentary lower jaw of ""Pseudoryzomys" aff. "P. simplex"" (i.e., an unnamed species close to "Pseudoryzomys simplex") is known from a cave deposit in Cueva Tixi, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, outside the current distribution of the species. It is dated from the first millennium CE. The jaw's morphology agrees with that of "P. simplex", but the toothrow is relatively long (5.78 mm; 4.61 to 5.60 mm in three specimens of "P. simplex") and the first molar is relatively narrow (1.28 mm; 1.30 to 1.40 mm in five "P. simplex").
"P. simplex" inhabits open, usually humid tropical and subtropical lowlands. In Argentina, it is mainly a species of the eastern Chaco and in Brazil it is found in the Cerrado and Caatinga. Most specimens for which habitat data are known were caught on the ground in humid grassland, some in seasonally flooded areas; an Argentinean specimen was captured in dense swamp vegetation. It is terrestrial and semiaquatic, living on the ground but also spending time in the water.
Nothing is known about behavior or diet. "P. simplex" has frequently been found in pellets of the barn owl ("Tyto alba") and also in those of the great horned owl ("Bubo virginianus"). It is a preferred prey of the maned wolf ("Chrysocyon brachyurus").
Conservation status.
The species is not known to be threatened and its conservation status is classified as least concern by the IUCN. It is a widely distributed species without substantial threats to its continued existence, but degradation of its habitat may endanger some populations. It was assessed as "potentially vulnerable" in Argentina.

Brazilian arboreal mouse

The Brazilian arboreal mouse (Rhagomys rufescens) is a South American rodent species of the family Cricetidae. It is found in the Atlantic Forest of southeast Brazil, often close to bamboo thickets. It can be distinguished from "Rhagomys longilingua", the only other species in its genus, by the absence of spines among the hair. Formerly believed to be extinct after no sightings were recorded for over 100 years, the species has since been found in four localities. However, it is nowhere common, and all of these are forest fragments, and ongoing deforestation threatens the species' survival. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being "vulnerable".
Description.
The Brazilian arboreal mouse is a small mouse with small rounded ears and vibrissae (whiskers) long enough to reach the ears. The dorsal fur is reddish-brown which gradually fades to reddish-grey on the ventral surface. The hair is soft, and this distinguishes "Rhagomys rufescens" from the only other species in the genus, "Rhagomys longilingua", which has spines mixed in with the hairs. They also differ in certain skull characteristics, and their ranges do not overlap. The head-and-body length slightly exceeds the tail length. The tail is brownish and has small scales. It is sparsely clad in blackish hairs that get longer near the tip and form a tuft. The hind feet are broad with bare soles and fleshy plantar pads. The hallux (big toe) bears a nail rather than a claw, a unique characteristic of this genus. The female has three pairs of mammary glands.
Distribution and habitat.
"R. rufescens" was first described in 1886 from Rio de Janeiro State in Brazil but it has not been found in that locality for over one hundred years and was believed to be extinct. However, it has now been found in four other localities in Brazil, near Ubatuba in São Paulo State, including in Pincinguaba State Park, and near Viçosa in Minas Gerais State. It typically lives in Atlantic forest, often among bamboos, and also in modified forest habitats.
Ecology.
Little is known about this species and its natural history. Several specimens were caught in pitfall traps sunk in the ground, but it is thought that it is an arboreal rodent, or one that scrambles among the undergrowth, because of the morphology of its feet. Examination of the stomach contents of one individual that was caught showed that it had eaten several species of ant.

The Mystery of the Brass Bound Trunk

The Mystery of the Brass Bound Trunk is the seventeenth volume in the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series, published under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. It was first published in 1940 by Grosset &amp; Dunlap and was extensively revised for publication in 1976.
1940 version.
Nancy plans a trip to South America by boat, along with chums George and Bess. They have joined a tour being conducted by an exclusive girls school. To Nancy's amazement, the mother of one of the students (Mrs. Joslin) protests Nancy's presence on the tour. Prior to departure, Nancy learns there are issues involving the Trenton trunk company, mostly concerning the quality of merchandise; the owner of the company, who is a friend of Carson Drew, asks Nancy to interfere in daughter Doris' life and relationships so she will marry the son of a former business partner. Nancy must solve several mysteries: who the mysterious red-haired young man could be; why Doris is so withdrawn; what is going on with the trunk company; why did Mrs. Joslin so vehemently protest Nancy's presence, as well as aiding her daughter Nestrelda; and solve the mix-up with Nestrelda's and Nancy's identical (or are they?) monogrammed Trenton trunks.
1976 revision.
On a trip to New York City from the Netherlands, Nancy, Bess, and George, along with new friend Nelda, must discover why someone is threatening both Nancy and Nelda, who share the same initials, and also discover the origin of a mysterious trunk bearing the initials N.D. Nancy must also unravel the mysteries of smuggled jewelry, and purloined documents from an African government.
Artwork.
The 1940 cover art depicts Nancy and George attempting to stop Nancy's trunk from being removed from the ship. The 1962 art was updated by Rudy Nappi, and depicts Nancy, Bess and George in the same scene, wearing Kennedy suits. For the revised story in 1976, Nappi presents Nancy against a background of brown, with a montage of images, including a jewel cache.

Boldog, Slovakia

Boldog or Pozsonyboldogfa (in , in ) is a village and municipality in western Slovakia in Senec District in the Bratislava Region.
Geography.
The municipality lies at an altitude of 124 metres and covers an area of 4.496 km2. It has a population of about 433.
History.
In the 9th century, the territory of Boldog was part of possibly of Greater Moravia and from 1000 part of the Kingdom of Hungary. In historical records the village was first mentioned in 1245.
After the Austro-Hungarian army disintegrated in November 1918, Czechoslovak troops occupied the area and by the Treaty of Trianon, the village became part of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945 Boldog became part Hungary again through the First Vienna Award. From 1945 until the Velvet Divorce, it was part of Czechoslovakia. Since then it has been part of Slovakia.
Roman Inscription.
In 1978, during restoration work in the church, a remarkable gravestone for a Roman Centurion of Legio XV Apollinaris, who is also described as a 'Negotiator' or trader, was found in the wall of the sacristy. The inscription is as follows: 
&lt;poem&gt;Q ATILIVS

Quintus Atilius Cogitatus, Atilia, Quint L EAV Privatus and Martialis heirs. P had erected. The XV legion was stationed at Carnuntum, a Roman Limes, or frontier fort on the Danube and the gravestone is likely to date from between 90-138AD. As Boldog lies between Bratislava and Trnava, to the east of the Danube, Quintus Atilius Primus must have died outside the area of the Roman Empire. This might indicate that there was a trading post in the vicinity, to which he moved after his career in the Roman Army.
The Parish Church.
The Church, dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is one of a group of Romanesque churches in Western Slovakia. The first phase dates from first half of the 12th century, or even the 11th century AD. Around 1220 the church was extended to the west, and a tower built with a triple tiered arrangement of Romanesque window openings. Brick was used for this extension, as was the case at Dražovce church near Nitra.
Other Romanesque features include a finely carved baptismal font, a decorative Tympanum over the west door and grotesque animal head brackets below the eaves of the roof. In 1280 the Church and the village came into the ownership of the Poor Clares and between 1364 and 1370 they made modifications to the church in the Gothic style.

Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur

The Sri Mahamariamman Temple (Tamil: ஸ்ரீ மகாமாரியம்மன் திருக்கோவில், "Śrī Māriyammaṉ Kōvil") is the oldest Hindu temple in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Founded in 1873, it is situated at the edge of Chinatown in Jalan Bandar (formerly High Street). In 1968, a new structure was built, featuring the ornate 'Raja Gopuram' tower in the style of South Indian temples.
From its inception, the temple provided an important place of worship for early Indian immigrants and is now an important cultural and national heritage.
History.
The Sri Mahamariamman Temple was founded by K. Thamboosamy Pillai in 1873 and was initially used as a private shrine by the Pillai family. The family threw the temple doors open to the public in the late 1920s and eventually handed the management of the temple over to a board of trustees.
This is the oldest functioning Hindu temple in Malaysia. It is also reputed to be the richest in the country. The temple was originally sited somewhere near the Kuala Lumpur railway station. It shifted to its present location along Jalan Tun H.S. Lee (next to KL's Chinatown) in 1885.
The initial attap structure was demolished in 1887 and a brick building was erected in its place. That structure was demolished to make way for the current temple building which were completed in 1968. The impressive gateway to the temple, known as the "gopuram", was completed in 1972. The new temple was consecrated in 1973.
Architecture.
Gopuram.
Built in the South Indian style, the temple's most outstanding feature is the impressive 5-tiered "gopuram" (tower). It is the tallest structure in the temple. The dramatic 22.9 m (75 ft) high pyramid-shaped gate tower is decorated with depictions of Hindu gods sculpted by artisans from southern India. The chief sculptor was the late S. T. Muniappa from Tamil Nadu and is credited for creating the 228 idols on the gopuram.
Main Prayer Hall.
This Temple resembles the form of a human body lying on its back with the head positioned towards the west and the feet towards the east. The temple's 5-tiered gopuram corresponds to the feet of the body. It is the threshold between the material and spiritual world.
At the rear is the garbagraham or sanctum sanctorum, which corresponds to the head. It is a freestanding structure with its own roof and walls and has one entrance that faces east. This is the inner sanctum where the chief deity Sri Maha Mariamman is located. The priest stands in front of the garbagraham when performing the puja (prayers).
Within the temple is a main prayer hall with richly decorated ceilings. The location of three shrines in the main temple is marked by an ornately embellished onion dome which can be seen from outside. There is also four smaller shrines located peripherally around the main temple building
Pillaiyar is in the shrine on the left and Lord Muruga, his brother, is on the right. Pillaiyar is also found at the entrance as he is the remover of obstacles. The eight idols adorning the pillars inside the temple are of ashta Lakshmi.
Once every 12 years, in keeping with Hindu tradition, the temple is reconsecrated.
Silver Chariot.
A silver chariot is housed within the premises. This chariot is a prominent feature during the annual Thaipusam festival. It used during this occasion for transporting the statuettes of Lord Muruga and his consorts (Valli and Teivayanni) through the city streets to Batu Caves. It made its debut in 1983 and was built at a cost of RM350,000 using 350 kilograms of silver.
The chariot was made in India and shipped here in 12 parts to be assembled. It is 6.5 metres tall and has 240 bells and a pair of horses on it. Before the silver chariot, a wooden one was used which was made 1930 by Indian craftsmen at a cost of RM50,000.
Bangunan Mariamman.
Recently, the Sri Maha Mariamman Temple has, after a 40-year wait, finally got its own building. The RM 13 million six-storey building, behind the temple in Jalan Tun H.S Lee was officially opened by Works Minister and MIC President Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu.
Temple chairman R. Nadarajah said the idea to construct the building was mooted by Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu 38 years ago when he was a committee member of the temple. Known as Bangunan Mariamman, the building is beside the Klang Bus Station and opposite the Pasar Seni LRT/MRT station. It is connected to the temple and has two floors of basement car parks, three floors for two auditoriums and a hall.
The Deity.
Mariamman is popularly worshipped by overseas Indians, especially Tamils because she is looked upon as their protector during their sojourn to foreign lands. Mariamman is a manifestation of the goddess - Parvati, an incarnation embodying Mother Earth with all her terrifying force. She protects her devotees from unholy or demonic events.
Administration.
The Sri Mahamariamman Temple is managed by the Board of Management of Sri Maha Mariamman Temple Devasthanam, which also manages the Batu Caves Sri Subramaniam Temple and the Kortumalai Pillaiyar Temple. It also performs the role of Hindu Religious Consultant to the Government of Malaysia in determining the Hindu yearly calendar.
Festivals.
The temple is particularly packed on Deepavali with devotees eager to offer their prayers on the holy day.
Also on the holy day of Thaipusam, thousands of devotees throng the temple at the wee hours of the morning to start a long procession leading up to Batu Caves as a religious undertaking to Lord Muruga. They carry containers containing milk as offering to Lord Muruga either by hand or in huge decorated carriers on their shoulders called 'kavadi'.

Dmitry Chernov

Dmitry Konstantinovich Chernov (or Tchernov, ; Saint-Petersburg - January 2, 1921 Yalta) was a Russian metallurgist. He is known by his discovery of polymorphous transformations in steel and the iron-carbon phase diagram. This discovery is the beginning of scientific metallography.
Biography.
Chernov was born to a family of a feldsher (registered nurse). In 1858 he graduated from the Petersburg Practical Technological Institute and worked for the Saint Petersburg Mint. In 1859-1865 he was a lecturer and the museum keeper of the Petersburg Practical Technological Institute. From 1866 he was an engineer of the Obukhovsky Steel Foundry in Saint Petersburg. In 1880–1884 he explored the salt deposit near Bakhmach (currently Ukraine). From 1884 he was with the Government "Naval Committee" (морской комитет). From 1886 he was the Chief Inspector of the Rail Road Department. From 1889 he was a Professor of the Mikhailovskaya Artillery Academy in Saint Petersburg.
Works.
Chernov obtained his major result in 1866-1868 after studying the rejects of heavy guns production as well as during analysis of practical works by Pavel Anosov, P. Obukhov, Alexander Lavrov, Nikolay Kalkutsky. At that time he was the curator of the small museum of the Petersburg Technological Institute. He found that steel is not the same material at all temperatures but instead has polymorphic transformations at different temperatures. He introduced different points known as Chernov's points:
Chernov was able to correctly identify the reason for these points as polymorphic transformations in the steel and even draw the first sketch of what the phase diagram for the carbon-iron system may look like. Chernov published his results in the "Notes of the Russian Technical Society" of 1868. His article was named "Критический обзор статей гг. Лаврова и Калакуцкого о стали и стальных орудиях и собственные Д. К. Чернова исследования по этому же предмету" ("Critical review of articles by Mr. Lavrov and Mr Kalkutzky about the steel and steel guns as well as own D.K. Chernov's research on this subject"). Many authors consider the publication of this article as the date of transformation of metallurgy from an art into a science.
Ten years later in 1879 Chernov published a monograph named "Research into the structure of the steel slabs" where he described the major crystalline structures in steel and their effect on the properties of the slab. One type of steel crystal (dendrite) was named after Chernov.
Chernov contributed to the theory of the Siemens-Martin process. He was one of the first to suggest usage of pure oxygen in steel-making. He also did research into the usage of direct reduced iron as well as contributed to the development of steel gun barrels, armor-piercing shells and emerging aviation.
He was one of the recognized leaders of steel manufacturing at the time. He was Chairman of the "Russian Metallurgical Society", vice-president of the "British Institute for Iron and Steel", an honorary member of the "American Society of Mining Engineers", etc.

The Mystery at the Moss-Covered Mansion

The Mystery at the Moss-Covered Mansion is the eighteenth volume in the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap, and was first published in 1941. The original text was written by ghostwriter Mildred Wirt Benson, based upon a plot outline from Stratemeyer Syndicate co-owner Harriet Stratemeyer Adams. The book's title was changed to "Mystery of the Moss-Covered Mansion" when it was revised in 1971, because the story is completely different and not much of the investigation takes place at the title location. In the original, many plots and much investigation all tie back to the same house deep in the forest, while Nancy helps her father locate an heiress, expose an impostor, investigate a murder, and look into strange screams at the mansion; none of the action in the original story took place in River Heights.
Synopsis - 1941 edition.
Nancy's father Carson Drew enlists her help in tracking down a missing heiress, and Nancy, Bess and George stumble upon a mysterious moss-covered mansion. They later hear that someone was murdered near the mansion, and upon investigating they hear strange noises emanating from within. The story includes a great deal of action; aside from the aforementioned missing heiress and murder, there is a needy elderly lady, a reclusive artist, an airplane accident, and a forest fire.
It starts with Nancy and her friends Bess Marvin and George Fayne, who are on a trip to a place called Ashley to meet Carson Drew, Nancy's father. Nancy and George are waiting for Bess, who has been looking for a place to get more water. It is already late, and the girls are nervous about what has happened to Bess. Nancy and George finally find her near an old mansion covered in moss. Bess claims to have heard a creepy scream from the house. George teases her, but then falls into a lily pond and loses her special watch. The girls then hear the scream that Bess mentioned. Nancy wants to investigate, but a man comes out of the house and orders them away. They hear a shot from the mansion, and Nancy grows more curious. The man comes out again and orders the girls away, and this time they return to Nancy's car and drive to Ashley, mulling over the strange experience along the way. George suddenly notices that she has lost her watch. It is too late to go back now, but they make plans to return the next day to look for the watch.
Nancy and her friends arrive at Mrs. Lee's boarding house, where they are to stay while in Ashley. Carson Drew has not yet arrived. Nancy has had a likeness of herself painted by the famous Jules Raynad as a gift for her father's birthday. Upon unpacking it, she discovers that the painting has been slightly scratched in transit. Mrs. Lee, who has studied art under another famous artist, Karl Karter, offers Nancy her old paints to try and fix the painting, which Nancy does. Nancy gives the painting to her father during a birthday celebration, and he loves it.
The next day, the girls return to the mansion. They hear a scream again, and are ordered away by a servant, who releases a wild dog on them. The dog runs after Nancy, who dodges it, and then goes to warn Bess and George. The three girls quickly climb a tree to escape the dog, who keeps barking at them, giving them no chance to escape. Finally, Carson Drew finds the girls and ties the dog to a tree.
Upon returning to the boarding house, Nancy is surprised to see Jules Raynad, the artist who painted her picture. The artist is mad to learn that his work has been damaged, but impressed by how Nancy fixed it. Mr. Raynad is able to give Nancy some information on the moss covered mansion. He says that the Hurd family used to live there, but all of them died from a strange, incurable illness. The house has been abandoned for years, as everyone is afraid of catching this disease. Nancy is excited over this valuable piece of information.
Later, Nancy and her friends meet Ned Nickerson, who is delivering special papers concerning Carson Drew's current case. Ned informed Nancy that someone has been shot on the grounds of the moss covered mansion. Nancy, Bess and George further investigate the mansion, but find nothing.
When they return to the boarding house, Bess and George catch poison ivy and are treated. During dinner that night, Mr. Drew talks about his case. It concerns a missing young woman named June Campbell who has inherited $52,000. June would be 22 years old. Nancy and her friends decide to search for the heiress. The next day, Nancy and her friends go to a carnival. They watch an act with a cute but mischievous monkey, who runs away. Nancy and other carnival goers search for the monkey, then Nancy and her friends return to the boarding house. There, they spot a man described as “gypsy-like...who wore large dangling earrings and a bandana on the back of his head” who accuses Nancy of shooting his brother. He tracked Nancy from her license number given to him by a fisherman who saw Nancy, Bess, and George at the crime scene. The man gives his name as Ramo, and demands revenge for his brother's death. Once Ramo leaves, Nancy is told of a Mrs. Labelle, who served as June Campbell's nanny while her parents traveled. The next day, Nancy, Bess, and George pay Mrs. Labelle a visit. The old woman is poor, and her house has fallen into disrepair. Nancy and her friends take pity on the woman, and vow to help her. Mrs. Labelle gives Nancy a picture of June, but suddenly the ceiling crashes down on them. Mrs. Labelle dislocates her arm, so Bess and George drive her to Ashley for care while Nancy tries to clean up the mess and salvage pictures of June. As she works, Ramo tries to make trouble for Nancy, but is scared away when Carson Drew comes.
Later, Mrs. Labelle tells Nancy that June had a friend named Penelope Parson. Nancy tracks down Penelope, who tells her that June wrote her several months ago saying that she was to be married to a man named Roland. A few days later, Carson Drew announces that he will return to River Heights, as his secretary has received word from June Campbell. Nancy has engaged for a repairman to fix Mrs. Labelle's house, and she oversees the work.
Mr. Drew decides to bring June Campbell to Ashley so Mrs. Labelle and Penelope Parson may be reunited with her. While awaiting the arrival of the young heiress, Nancy, Bess, and George return to the moss covered mansion. After Bess is spooked by a snake and a lion's roar coming from the house, George quickly finds her watch. She and Bess are ready to leave, but Nancy investigates further and finds a police officer's badge. The girls then leave. On the way to Ashley, they encounter the missing monkey. They bring him back to the boarding house, where he is entrusted to the care of the butler. The girls then go to Mrs. Labelle's house, where they prepare dinner for the arrival of June Campbell. The girls are excited to meet her, although Mrs. Labelle and Penelope say she has changed. The heiress is ungrateful and cold towards the girls, and Nancy is disappointed and suspicious. That night, Nancy stays up late discussing the matter with Mrs. Lee. She finds that she has accidentally taken Mrs. Labelle's key, and drives to Mrs. Labelle's house with Mrs. Lee to return it. Parked outside of the old woman's home, she sees Ramo climbing a ladder into June Campbell's bedroom. Running into the house, she finds June's door locked, so she climbs into it using the ladder. The ladder sways and Nancy falls, but is unhurt. Sending out a police report to be on the lookout for Ramo, Nancy returns home. After talking with her father, they decide that this June Campbell was an impostor. Unfortunately, Carson Drew has already given her the entire inheritance in cash.
The next day, while George and Bess are at the moss covered mansion, George finds a business card near the crime scene. It is for a Madame Cully, a psychic reader in nearby Carbon City. They show it to Nancy, who decides that it must belong to Ramo. Nancy and her friends then go to Carbon City. While in a soda shop, they overhear a woman telling her friend of how accurate Madame Cully's readings are. Nancy picks up the information that the psychic reader has an attractive daughter. When they reach Madame Cully's place, they see that she has bought an expensive, custom car. Once the salesman leaves, Ramo appears, and get in the car with Madame Cully and a girl wearing a blue veil, who is Madame Cully's daughter. The girls watch the suspicious group, then Bess and George run off for the police while Nancy makes sure the car does not leave. Nancy jumps into the car, but is thrown out by Ramo. As the car drives away, a neighbor comes to check on Nancy. He tells her that Madame Cully's daughter is named Venus. Bess and George come back with a policeman. They drive with him in search of the thieves, but are unsuccessful. Driving back, Nancy, Bess, and George see the carnival again. They tell the man there that they have found his monkey, and he tells them that Madame Cully has been working for their carnival and that her maiden name was Ramo. He also says that Venus's father, a beloved acrobat, had died doing a stunt. Venus loved her father and inherited his looks and disposition. The man describes her as pretty, with light red hair and dark eyes and the ability to imitate voices. He says that she is about 22 years old, and seems to be hypnotized by her mother.
On the way back, Nancy spots Madame Cully's new car at a gas station. The attendant says that she traded him the car for another. He gives Nancy the motor number and she returns to the boarding house, where she gives her father this information. Then she, George and Bess return to the moss covered mansion. They meet a couple who asks them for directions to the mansion. Nancy gives them directions and they drive off. The girls also go to the mansion, where they find a pearl-handled revolver. The bearded man grabs the revolver from her, and the girls chase him in vain before returning to the boarding house. There they learn that Mrs. Labelle has suffered a heart attack. They go at once to her house, where Penelope is taking care of her. Nancy, Bess, and George volunteer to take care of Mrs. Labelle and plan to stay at her house overnight. While in the room occupied by Venus Cully, Nancy finds a note written by June Campbell to Madame Cully. From the note, Nancy can tell that Venus was practicing copying June's handwriting. The note also states that June once lived in a town called Liberty Corners. After Mrs. Labelle has another heart attack, Nancy, Bess and George decide to engage a nurse with the reward they earned for finding the missing monkey. Once they return to the boarding house, Nancy makes plans with her father for them to go on a private plane to Liberty Corners. After boarding the plane, the pilot gets lost in the mist and the plane crashes. Once Nancy regains consciousness, she looks frantically for her dad. The plane catches on fire and starts a forest fire. While trying to help the pilot, who has escaped the wreckage, Nancy is knocked unconscious. She finds herself in a dark chamber, in which she hears strange moans and screams. Making her way out of the place, she looks back and realizes that she was in the moss covered mansion. Nancy rushes to a hospital, where she meets George and Bess, who tell her that her dad is recovering. The girls then return to the boarding house. Nancy wakes up that afternoon and goes to visit her father.
The next day, Nancy goes with George and Bess to Liberty Corners. On the train there, she meets Jules Raynad. Mr. Raynad tells them about Karl Karter, the artist. Karter loves to paint wild animals, and met Burton Campbell, June's father, who guided him through Africa while he painted. Mr. Raynad says that he knew June, and gives Nancy her address. They are all disappointed to find June's home deserted. When the girls visit Mrs. Labelle, the woman tells them that Ramo has no brother. After deciding that Ramo's story was a lie, the three girls then return to the moss covered mansion, where Nancy sees Ramo digging for something. It starts to rain, so the girls return to the boarding house. Then they go back to the moss covered mansion, where they see Ramo digging again. Nancy disconnects wires in Ramo's car, and then the girls go for the police and bring them back to the mansion, where they catch Ramo. They find money in the container he dug up. Ramo confesses to his part in the scheme, and is arrested while the police send out a warning for Madame Cully. Nancy and her friends return to the boarding house, where they meet Jules Raynad. He tells them that a Miss Campbell, probably June, is posing for Karl Karter, but does not know where the artist lives. Once Mr. Raynad leaves, Nancy is informed that Ramo broke out of jail. Nancy, Bess, and George drive around Ashley with Mr. Drew. They find a policeman with a cornered suspect, and identify him as Ramo.
The next day, the four go to the police investigation of the moss covered mansion, where Nancy finds a wallet with papers bearing the name Karl Karter. The bearded man comes out of the house and Nancy uses the wallet to make him admit his identity. The bearded man was Karl Karter, who had hidden in the mansion to avoid callers and curious townspeople so he could paint in peace. The artist takes them inside the mansion, where they find out that the screams and other noises were from the wild animals Karter uses as models for his paintings. They find the real June Campbell, Karter's model, fighting off a leopard. The leopard lunges at Nancy, but June saves her. Carson Drew and two policemen come into the house and are introduced to June. Ramo discloses where more money can be found, and Nancy finds more in a secret hiding place. They find more in the woods, however most of it is still with Madame Cully. Karl Karter admits that one of his servants reached Nancy from the plane wreckage. He also says that the pearl-handled revolver is June Campbell's, for protecting herself against the wild animals. Nancy finds out that the couple asking her for directions to the moss covered mansion was June Campbell and her husband. The next day, June is reunited with Penelope and Mrs. Labelle. June decides to give Mrs. Labelle part of her inheritance to use for care and to repair her house. They decide to take some pictures at the moss covered mansion. They see Madame Cully there, and report her to the police. The woman is arrested and the rest of June's inheritance is found. Thanks to Nancy, Venus Cully joins the carnival for a nice salary. June Campbell's inheritance is restored to her in full.
1971 revision.
Now retitled "Mystery of the Moss-Covered Mansion", a friend of Nancy's father has been arrested and charged with sending a truck loaded with explosive oranges into the Space Center complex at Cape Kennedy. Knowing that he could not possibly be guilty of sabotage, Nancy and her father rush to the defense of the accused man. During the Drews' investigation, Nancy becomes suspicious of an old, spooky mansion. Behind a high mesh enclosure, wild African animals roam about the extensive grounds. Nancy discovers that something besides the training of wild animals is going on at the mysterious moss-covered mansion estate.
Adult critics among collectors' groups frequently comment on strange elements of the revised story, such as the explosive oranges, and a spy-thriller climax with Ned and Nancy trapped in the house, nearly dying by falling in a pool of boiling water before rescue.
Artwork.
The original dust jacket was painted by Russell H. Tandy, and depicts Nancy, Bess, and George digging for buried money on the grounds of the title location. Tandy also illustrated a frontispiece; this volume is the first in the series to have only one illustration on plain paper; previously, glossy, highly detailed art was used. The cover, but not the interior illustration, was updated to the same scene, set in the 1960s, with Nancy, Bess and George, by Rudy Nappi. Nappi also illustrated the new volume's location with Nancy in the foreground stalked by a panther. An uncredited artist provided five internal line drawings and a frontispiece for the revised text.

Secondary calculus and cohomological physics

In mathematics, secondary calculus is a proposed expansion of classical differential calculus on manifolds, to the "space" of solutions of a (nonlinear) partial differential equation. It is a sophisticated theory at the level of jet spaces and employing algebraic methods.
Secondary calculus.
Secondary calculus acts on the space of solutions of a system of partial differential equations (usually nonlinear equations). When the number of independent variables is zero (i.e. the equations are all algebraic) secondary calculus reduces to classical differential calculus.
All objects in secondary calculus are cohomology classes of differential complexes growing on diffieties. The latter are, in the framework of secondary calculus, the analog of smooth manifolds.
Cohomological physics.
Cohomological physics was born with Gauss's theorem, describing the electric charge contained inside a given surface in terms of the flux of the electric field through the surface itself. Flux is the integral of a differential form and, consequently, a de Rham cohomology class. It is not by chance that formulas of this kind, such as the well known Stokes formula, though being a natural part of classical differential calculus, have entered in modern mathematics from physics.
Classical analogues.
All the constructions in classical differential calculus have an analog in secondary calculus. For instance, higher symmetries of a system of partial differential equations are the analog of vector fields on differentiable manifolds. The Euler operator, which associates to each variational problem the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equation, is the analog of the classical differential associating to a function on a variety its differential. The Euler operator is a secondary differential operator of first order, even if, according to its expression in local coordinates, it looks like one of infinite order. More generally, the analog of differential forms in secondary calculus are the elements of the first term of the so-called C-spectral sequence, and so on.
The simplest diffieties are infinite prolongations of partial differential equations, which are subvarieties of infinite jet spaces. The latter are infinite dimensional varieties that can not be studied by means of standard functional analysis. On the contrary, the most natural language in which to study these objects is differential calculus over commutative algebras. Therefore, the latter must be regarded as a fundamental tool of secondary calculus. On the other hand, differential calculus over commutative algebras gives the possibility to develop algebraic geometry as if it were differential geometry.
Theoretical physics.
Recent developments of particle physics, based on quantum field theories and its generalizations, have led to understand the deep cohomological nature of the quantities describing both classical and quantum fields. The turning point was the discovery of the famous BRST transformation. For instance, it was understood that observables in field theory are classes in horizontal de Rham cohomology which are invariant under the corresponding gauge group and so on. This current in modern theoretical physics is called Cohomological Physics.
It is relevant that secondary calculus and cohomological physics, which developed for twenty years independently from each other, arrived at the same results. Their confluence took place at the international conference "Secondary Calculus and Cohomological Physics" (Moscow, August 24–30, 1997).
Prospects.
A large number of modern mathematical theories harmoniously converges in the framework of secondary calculus, for instance: commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, homological algebra and differential topology, Lie group and Lie algebra theory, differential geometry, etc.

Žaliakalnis

Žaliakalnis (literally, "the green hill") is a neighbourhood and eldership () in Lithuania's second largest city, Kaunas. Žaliakalnis is located north of the old town and the city center area, between the Neris and Girstupis valleys. It is one of the largest residential areas in Kaunas, with a population of 38,480 in 2006.
History.
Žaliakalnis became part of Kaunas in 1919, when the city became the temporary capital of Lithuania. Kaunas expanded rapidly and the need for a comprehensive plan became evident by 1922. The Danish engineer M. Frandsen was invited to devise this plan.
In Frandsen's plan, Žaliakalnis was to be an important part of Kaunas, where all the city's administrative functions would be located. This part of the concept was not fulfilled, although the neighbourhood quickly became very popular and many modern residences were built. In 1924-1925 alone, more than 300 plots were created and sold. In accordance with the plan, its streets were planted with different species of trees, and space was left for gardens. By 1940, the area was largely built up, and only a few plots remained vacant.
Points of interest.
Žaliakalnis is home to Ąžuolynas Park, containing a stand of centuries-old oak trees. It is the largest stand of urban oaks in Europe, covering 63 hectares. A few sections of the park have been separated into Vytautas Park and Dainų slėnis. The only Zoo in Lithuania is located across the road from Ąžuolynas. A large number of buildings of functionalism architecture, predominant in the interbellum, are still preserved in the elderate.
Žaliakalnis was home to some well-known Lithuanian writers and artists such as Balys Sruoga, Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius, Ieva Simonaitytė, Kazys Binkis, Kipras Petrauskas, President Valdas Adamkus grew up here.
Now Žaliakalnis is a popular upmarket residential area.
Žaliakalnis contains a number of sports facilities and educational institutions:

New England Music Camp

The New England Music Camp (NEMC) is a summer camp for music students ages 11–18, located on in Sidney, Maine, on the eastern shore of Messalonskee Lake in the Belgrade Lakes region. It was founded in 1937 on the site of the defunct Eastern Music Camp.
The camp has facilities for some 200 campers as well as faculty and staff. It follows a balanced structure of musical training (in the morning) and standard athletic activities (in the afternoon) such as sailing, kayaking, archery, tennis, softball, soccer, volleyball, badminton etc. There are numerous concerts offered free to the public during its six-week season on site at the Bowl in the Pines or Alumni Hall (respectively, the camp's outdoor and indoor performance venues).
New England Music Camp has many alumni move on to successful careers in music. NEMC alumni have won positions in the New York Philharmonic, the St. Louis Symphony, the Chicago Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra and the Houston Symphony.
Music facilities.
Bowl in the Pines.
The Bowl in the Pines, North America's second largest outdoor amphitheater, is home to concerts by all of NEMC's performing groups every Saturday and on select Fridays at 3:00 p.m. for the entire camp season. The Symphony Band, Symphony Orchestra, Stage Band, and Jazz Ensemble rehearse on the bowl stage in the mornings. Backstage are several practice rooms, and the percussion, tuba, and bass studios. The bowl is also used for the annual talent shows, quad cabin activities, and more.
Alumni Hall.
Alumni Hall is the camp's recital hall located near the entrance to campus. Alumni hall seats over 300 people and hosts faculty recitals Tuesday nights at 7:30 and student honor recitals thursday nights at 7:30. The Concert Band, Concert Orchestra, Treble Choir, and Jazz Band rehearse in Alumni Hall in the mornings. On other nights, alumni hall is used for social functions such as the square dance, all camp movie night, and dual cabin activities.
Classrooms and practice areas.
Several other buildings on campus such as the Booth Ensemble Building, the Summer House, and Trustees Hall serve as classrooms for music classes (music theory, orchestral literature, conducting, etc.), sectional rehearsals, and chamber music rehearsals. Numerous practice cabins serve as space for solo practice and private lessons.
Recreational facilities.
Waterfront.
The NEMC waterfront consists of a sailing area, a canoe area, and a swimming area. The camp owns seven sailboats and several canoes and kayaks, many of which are used daily in afternoon recreational activities. In addition to being an option for assigned recreation, the swimming area is open to all campers during afternoon free time. The waterfront is run by several counselors and the assistant head counselors, all of whom are certified lifeguards.
Recreational fields.
The recreational fields consist of full soccer and ultimate frisbee fields, a softball field, an archery range, two sand volleyball courts, a weightlifting station, and a basketball court. Three tennis courts are located behind the Lodge across campus, but are still used for afternoon recreation. The rec fields are also used for camper games and all camp olympics, as well as the camper vs. faculty softball game.
Dining facilities.
Lodge.
The Lodge is the dining hall, where all students and faculty have breakfast, lunch, and dinner and are told important announcements for the day, such as rehearsal time and other activities. During lunch, mail call takes place in the Lodge. There is a kitchen, the student eating area, a faculty eating area, and a "staff only" upstairs.
Canteen.
The Canteen sells a wide variety of drinks and snacks and is open for specific hours during the day. In addition, the Canteen also sells souvenirs such as tote bags and New England Music Camp apparel.
Housing.
All cabins at NEMC are organized strictly by age, and most have their own ping pong tables. Two cabins each share a separate shower house located between them. Each cabin also has its own fire pit for cabin cookouts which occur every Sunday night. The "Lodge" end of camp is located on the far south side running along the southern border. The "Bowl" end runs from the Bowl to the northern border of campus along the lakefront.

Southern Democratic Alliance

The Southern Democratic Alliance () is a pro-democracy political organization in Hong Kong. The Alliance was founded on February 1, 2004.
Its stated mission is to unite South Asians with local Chinese to build up a colorful Hong Kong. According to the party's chair, James Lung, local media have termed the Alliance the "Rising Sun of South Asians in the city."
Specifically emphasizing the need for stronger anti-discrimination legislation, the Alliance has focused on the desires of South Asians, specifically the Nepalese population in Hong Kong. One ally of the party has been the Nepalese spiritual group Heavenly Path. The two groups cosponsored a peace rally on July 1, 2007, which organizers claim drew more than 100 attendees.
The party's support for peace and reconciliation, including between mainland China and Taiwan, is at odds with official policy. This and other disagreement may have led to the August 4, 2008 closure of "e-Wiki", a collaborative wiki website that hosted articles linking party chairman James Lung to the banned Falun Gong movement and which described his criticism of China's Communist Party. More recently, the Alliance has petitioned for the accommodation of English-dominant minority groups in Hong Kong, asking the Subcommittee on Race Discrimination to make English-language job postings available from the labor department.
The Southern Democratic Alliance first fielded candidates in the 2008 Legislative Council elections, in the Kowloon West district. Its nominees were party chairman James Lung and Heavenly Path spiritual leader Sukra Bantawa, an ethnic Nepali. In the September 7, 2008 election, the Alliance received only 591 votes, out of 206,583 cast, or 0.3%.

Lead-bismuth eutectic

Lead-bismuth eutectic or LBE is a eutectic alloy of lead (44.5 at%) and bismuth (55.5 at%) used as a coolant in some nuclear reactors, and is a proposed coolant for the lead-cooled fast reactor, part of the Generation IV reactor initiative.
It has a melting point of 123.5 °C/254.3 °F (pure lead melts at 327 °C/621 °F, pure bismuth at 271 °C/520 °F) and a boiling point of 1,670 °C/3,038 °F.
Lead-bismuth alloys with between 30% and 75% bismuth all have melting points below 200 °C/392 °F.
Alloys with between 48% and 63% bismuth have melting points below 150 °C/302 °F.
While lead expands slightly on melting and bismuth contracts slightly on melting, LBE has negligible change in volume on melting.
History.
The Soviet Alfa-class submarines used LBE as a coolant for their nuclear reactors throughout the Cold War.
OKB Gidropress (the Russian developers of the VVER-type Light-water reactors) has expertise in LBE reactors. The SVBR-75/100, a modern design of this type, is one example of the extensive Russian experience with this technology.
Gen4 Energy (formerly Hyperion Power Generation), a United States firm connected with Los Alamos National Laboratory, announced plans in 2008 to design and deploy a uranium nitride fueled small modular reactor cooled by lead-bismuth eutectic for commercial power generation, district heating, and desalinization. The proposed reactor, called the Gen4 Module, was planned as a 70 MWth reactor of the sealed modular type, factory assembled and transported to site for installation, and transported back to the factory for refuelling. Gen4 Energy ceased operations in 2018.
Advantages.
As compared to sodium-based liquid metal coolants such as liquid sodium or NaK, lead-based coolants have significantly higher boiling points, meaning a reactor can be operated without risk of coolant boiling at much higher temperatures. This improves thermal efficiency and could potentially allow hydrogen production through thermochemical processes.
Lead and LBE also do not react readily with water or air, in contrast to sodium and NaK which ignite spontaneously in air and react explosively with water. This means that lead- or LBE-cooled reactors, unlike sodium-cooled designs, would not need an intermediate coolant loop, which reduces the capital investment required for a plant.
Both lead and bismuth are also an excellent radiation shield, absorbing gamma radiation while simultaneously being virtually transparent to neutrons. In contrast, sodium forms the potent gamma emitter sodium-24 (half-life 15 hours) following intense neutron radiation, requiring a large radiation shield for the primary cooling loop.
As heavy nuclei, lead and bismuth can be used as spallation targets for non-fission neutron production, as in accelerator transmutation of waste (see energy amplifier).
Both lead-based and sodium-based coolants have the advantage of relatively high boiling points as compared to water, meaning it is not necessary to pressurise the reactor even at high temperatures. This improves safety as it reduces the probability of a loss of coolant accident (LOCA), and allows for passively safe designs. The thermodynamic cycle (Carnot cycle) is also more efficient with a larger difference of temperature. A disadvantage of higher temperatures is also the higher corrosion rate of metallic structural components in LBE due to their increased solubility in liquid LBE with temperature (formation of amalgam) and to liquid metal embrittlement.
Limitations.
Lead and LBE coolant are more corrosive to steel than sodium, and this puts an upper limit on the velocity of coolant flow through the reactor due to safety considerations. Furthermore, the higher melting points of lead and LBE (327 °C and 123.5 °C respectively) may mean that solidification of the coolant may be a greater problem when the reactor is operated at lower temperatures.
Finally, upon neutron radiation bismuth-209, the main isotope of bismuth present in LBE coolant, undergoes neutron capture and subsequent beta decay, forming polonium-210, a potent alpha emitter. The presence of radioactive polonium in the coolant would require special precautions to control alpha contamination during refueling of the reactor and handling components in contact with LBE.

François Legault

François Legault (; born May 26, 1957) is a Canadian politician serving as the 32nd premier of Quebec since 2018. A founding member of the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ), he has led the party since it began in 2011. Legault sits as a member of the National Assembly (MNA) for the Lanaudière region riding of L'Assomption. Legault's ongoing tenure of , as premier is the seventh-longest in Quebec history. Concurrently, he is also the Dean of the Quebec National Assembly.
Prior to entering politics, he was the co-founder of the Canadian airline Air Transat. He was a MNA from 1998 to 2009—serving in the governments of former premiers Lucien Bouchard and Bernard Landry—as the minister of education from 1998 to 2003 and as the minister of health from 2002 to 2003. He was a member of the Parti Québécois (PQ), first elected in the 1998 Quebec election in the riding of Rousseau. He was re-elected in 2003, 2007, and 2008 but resigned his seat on June 25, 2009. He returned to the legislature following his victory in the 2012 Quebec provincial election as the MNA for L'Assomption, a suburb of Montreal. He was reelected in 2014. He led the CAQ to majority governments in the 2018 and 2022 provincial elections; the first government not of the Quebec Liberal Party or the Parti Québécois (PQ) since Jean-Jacques Bertrand's 1970 Union Nationale government.
Early life and education.
François Legault was born on May 26, 1957, at the Lachine Hospital and grew up in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec. His father, Lucien Legault, was a postmaster. His mother, Pauline Schetagne, was a housewife who also worked as a cashier at the local A&amp;P grocery store.
Legault has a bachelor's and master's degree in business administration from HEC Montréal. He is also a member of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants.
Business career.
Legault worked as an administrator for Provigo and an auditor for Ernst &amp; Young until 1984. In 1985, Legault became the director of finance and administration at Nationair Canada and then marketing director at Quebecair. He then co-founded Air Transat in 1986, and was until 1997 its chief executive officer. The airline quickly became one of the largest airline companies in Canada offering charter flights. From 1995 to 1998, Legault sat on the boards of various companies, including Provigo Inc., Culinar, Sico, Technilab Inc. and Bestar Inc., and the Marc-Aurèle Fortin private museum.
Early political career.
Parti Québécois.
Legault was recruited to politics by Lucien Bouchard, and was elected to the National Assembly at the 1998 election for the off-island suburban riding of Rousseau. He was immediately promoted to cabinet as minister for industry and commerce. He was later named the minister of education.
When Bouchard resigned, Legault supported Bernard Landry.
Landry appointed Legault as minister of education and later as minister of health and social services. He was re-elected in 2003 while the PQ lost to the Quebec Liberal Party. He remained on the PQ front bench as the critic for economics, economic development, and finances.
Legault endorsed Richard Legendre in the 2005 PQ leadership election, which was won by André Boisclair. After his re-election in 2007, Legault was renamed the PQ critic for economic development and finances.
Legault was re-elected in the 2008 election but announced on June 25, 2009, that he would retire from politics. He was seen by some political analysts at the time as a potential contender in a future leadership election. However, some Liberals thought that he could replace Jean Charest, then premier.
Leader of the Coalition Avenir Québec.
In February 2011, Legault co-founded with Charles Sirois a new political movement called the "Coalition pour l'avenir du Québec" ("Coalition for the Future of Quebec"). In November 2011 it became an official party under the name Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ). The CAQ aims to bring together like-minded voters in a single party regardless of their views on Quebec nationalism, Quebec federalism and Quebec autonomism. In a break with his sovereigntist past, Legault promised that a CAQ government would never hold a referendum on sovereignty. Soon after retiring from politics, he became disenchanted with sovereigntism and resigned from the PQ. He eventually came to believe that the decades-long debate over sovereignty had hindered Quebec's economic progress, and founded the CAQ as a party focused on developing the economy first. While he now believed Quebec belongs within Canada, he vowed that a CAQ government would "explore all options" to defend Quebec's interests and demand greater power.
The party finished third in the 2012 general election, winning 19 seats and 27.05 percent of the vote. At that election, Legault returned to the National Assembly as the member for the off-island suburban riding of L'Assomption. 
In the 2014 general election, the CAQ finished third again, but increased their seat count to 22.
In the 2018 general election on October 1, Legault led the CAQ to a gain of 53 seats for a total of 74, vaulting the CAQ from third place to a majority of 11 and making Legault the premier of Quebec. He is the first premier in 48 years to not hail from the Liberals or Parti Québécois.
Premier of Quebec (2018–present).
On October 18, 2018, Legault was sworn in as Premier of Quebec, marking the end of nearly 50 years of Liberal and Parti Québécois rule in the province.
Social issues.
Legault apologized to First Nations and Inuit in October 2019 for discrimination they suffered in dealing with the state, noting the Government of Quebec had failed in its duty to them. He acknowledged that apologies are but a first step, and more work needs to be done to break down barriers and rectify long-standing problems.
In May 2024, Legault criticized pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses, saying police should dismantle an "illegal" pro-Palestinian encampment at Montreal’s McGill University.
Religious symbols.
Having run on the platform during the 2018 election, on March 28, 2019, the Quebec government tabled its long-awaited secularism bill. Bill 21, entitled "An Act respecting the laicity of the State", if made law, would ban public workers in positions of authority from wearing religious symbols. This would include any public employee who carries a weapon, including police officers, courthouse constables, bodyguards, prison guards and wildlife officers, as well as Crown prosecutors, government lawyers and judges, school principals, vice-principals and teachers. The bill invoked notwithstanding clause of the "Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms" to prevent it from being overturned by the courts.
The bill passed on June 17 by a 73–35 vote, with backing of the Parti Québécois while the Liberals and Quebec Solidaire were opposed. The Coalition Avenir Quebec government also introduced a last-minute amendment toughening the law, making provisions for a minister to verify that it is being obeyed and to demand corrective measures if necessary.
Legault said the bill was moderate and that by having a law like this, it would prevent a party like France's Marine Le Pen National Rally in Quebec.
On May 2, 2024, The bill was renewed by using the notwithstanding clause for five more years until 2029.
Language.
In May 2022, The CAQ government of Legault passed Bill 96, with 78 MNAs in favour (from the CAQ and Québec solidaire) and 29 against (from the Liberal Party and Parti Québécois). The bill strengthens the 1970s Charter of the French Language bill.
In that same year Legault caused some controversy when he stated that Quebec risked losing French as an official language if Quebec did not have more control over immigration policy. He compared it to the U.S. state of Louisiana which once spoke French as a majority.
Immigration.
In Quebec, the leader of the CAQ, François Legault, controversially linked immigration to "violence" and "extremism." He also expressed concern about the threat that immigration of non-French speakers poses to the province's "national cohesion." Despite Legault's apologies for his comments, the immigration debate has been described as superficial, focusing on numbers and ambiguous concepts such as the province's capacity for integration. Experts and academics offer varied opinions on the matter. Pierre Fortin, Professor Emeritus of Economics at the UQAM, describes the figure proposed by Blackburn as "unreasonable," warning that it could lead to administrative chaos and encourage xenophobic and racist attitudes toward immigrants. On the other hand, Mireille Paquet, Professor of Political Science at Concordia University, questions this theory, indicating that research does not provide definitive answers and that negative reactions against immigrants are more due to feelings of insecurity among the non-immigrant population, feelings that can be exacerbated by public policies such as cuts to social services.
Various human rights and immigrant support organizations have expressed alarm over statements made by members of the Coalition Avenir Québec government, accusing them of contributing to a climate of anxiety by attributing the public services crisis to immigrants. This situation has been compared by some critics to an "extremely concerning trend of xenophobic populism" observed in Europe and other parts of the world. France-Isabelle Langlois, director of Amnesty International Canada, expressed her outrage, particularly in response to comments made by the Minister of the French Language, Jean-François Roberge, who stated that the "Québécois identity" is threatened by immigrants, which was interpreted as hate speech and xenophobic rhetoric.
Under Legault’s CAQ government, he has decreased immigration numbers to 40,000 in 2019, and in 2019 also introduced a values test for immigrants. The most critical aspect of this situation is the limited number of annual admissions set by François Legault's government, approximately 10,400, despite an inventory of nearly 40,000 pending cases. This limitation creates a significant bottleneck, resulting in a backlog of cases and great distress among the affected couples. According to Me Lapointe, the provincial government, under the Canada-Quebec Agreement specifying the role of each level of government in immigration, does not have the authority to impose a quota in the family reunification category. However, by processing only the number of cases desired by the Legault government, Ottawa would also be violating the terms of this agreement.
In 2019, during a European trip to France, Legault said he wanted more French and other European immigrants to come to Quebec with the overall immigration numbers cut.
In August 2019, Legault told businesses who called for an increase in immigration that they needed to boost wages if they wanted to find workers.
In December 2019, during a meeting with Governor of California Gavin Newsom, Legault declared that all French-Canadians are Catholic.
In June 2022, Legault stated he was against multiculturalism, in favor of supporting interculturalism and integration, which would include immigrants assimilating into Quebec and learning French.
In 2022, Legault raised the idea of having referendum on getting more immigration powers from federal government. In 2024, Legault repeated his calls on Quebec might hold a referendum on immigration powers if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not give the province more immigration powers.
COVID-19 pandemic.
During the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, Legault organized daily press conferences with Director of Public Health Horacio Arruda and Minister of Health Danielle McCann, starting March 12, to encourage the population to stay home and keep hygiene measures that would help suppress spread of the virus. In May, Canada's chief science adviser, Mona Nemer, criticized Quebec for its lack of testing and tracing strategy.
Environment.
In November 2020, Legault announced the government's plan to tackle climate change, which would involve a ban on the sale of new gas-powered vehicles from 2035 (commercial vehicles and second-hand cars would be exempt). Some experts have said that rather than focusing on electric vehicles, more funds should be committed to public transit and climate change mitigation.
Education.
The Legault government passed Bill 40 on February 8, 2020. This expropriated the province's 60 French school boards, turning them into school service centres.
Bill 40 was passed to expropriate school boards that have been running in English style for 175 years. This did not include nine English school boards. But the move is seen as further undermining English-language education in the province.
In April 2022, following a controversy over academic freedom at the University of Ottawa, the Legault government tabled Bill 32, a bill on Academic freedom in universities. The bill passed in June 2022.
Economy.
Legault and his government has promoted a buy local campaign. His government in early 2020 formed an online directory of local Quebec retailers in a website called  — or Blue Basket. The aim of is to be a local version and a competitor to Amazon to sell Quebec products. As early as November 2019 Legault supported calls for the creation of a Quebec version of Amazon, which his economy minister described as a way to serve nationalist customers.
2022 election.
Legault led the CAQ again in the 2022 general election to a second straight majority. Legault gained 14 seats in the election, expanding his caucus.
Other events.
In December 2023, half a million public sector workers went on strike. The provincial government has said it hopes to reach a deal with the unions before 2024.
In the fall of 2023, Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt announced a new battery gigafactory to be built near Montreal. Initially the factory intended to start production in 2026, but the timeline was delayed by 12 to 18 months according to CAQ minister Pierre Fitzgibbon. In March 2025, Northvolt declared bankruptcy; the CAQ government had invested millions in the proposed $7 billion factory. In April 2025, an inquiry began into the Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ)'s digitalization attempts, which ran $500 million over budget.
Popularity.
Since late 2023, the Legault government has been one of the most unpopular provincial governments in Canada, suffering from poor opinion polling throughout the 43rd Quebec Legislature. The party also lost the Jean-Talon, Terrebonne, and Arthabaska by-elections. CAQ MNA Youri Chassin resigned from the party in September 2024, criticizing the government.
Personal life.
Legault married Isabelle Brais on March 7, 1992, in Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec, and has two children.
Legault is Catholic.
Awards and honours.
Legault has been a Fellow of the (Order of Chartered Accountants of Québec) since 2000.

Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Penang

The Arulmigu Sri Mahamariamman Temple is a Hindu temple within George Town in the Malaysian state of Penang. The oldest Hindu temple in the state, it was built in 1833, and features sculptures of gods and goddesses over its main entrance and facade.
It is also known as Mariamman Temple or Queen Street Indian Temple. Throughout the years, the Sri Mahamariamman temple has also been known by several names: Sri Muthu Mariamman Temple, Sri Arulmigu Mahamariamman Temple, Sri Mariamman Temple. All these names refer to the same temple. The temple is open daily from 6:30 am - 12:00 noon and 4:30 pm - 9:00 pm. It became a place of worship as early as 1801 and became a temple in 1833. It has stood at the same place for more than 200 years.
Temple site.
The temple is in central Georgetown on Lebuh Queen (Queen Street) and the back entrance is on Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling (Pitt Street), in between Lebuh Pasar and Lebuh Chulia. Located in Penang's "Little India", in the capital city of Georgetown, the Sri Maha Mariamman temple reflects the city's rich cultural heritage.
Visitation to this temple is limited to morning and evening. Temple opens starts from morning 6 am till 12 pm and evening from 5 pm till 9 pm. The temples closes after the prayers are performed at 12 pm and 9 pm respectively. Daily there will be Pujas (prayers), mornings 7.30 am and evening 6.30 pm. Prayers are usually conducted by the temple priests in these times and visitors may observe these prayer sessions taking place. If you wish to enter the Sri Mahamariamman temple, it would be polite to ask permission from any of the priests and please remember to remove your shoes before entering the temple grounds.
Daily Poojas.
Darshan (meaning open to the public) hours are from 6 am to 9 pm. Temple is closed from 12:15 pm and reopened at 4:30 pm and closed at 9:15 pm.
The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. "Abishegam" or "Thirumanjanam" is anointment of the idol with oils, sandalwood paste, milk, unguents and the like and then bathing it with water in an act of ritual purification. The most prominent abishegams are conducted at the ceremonies to mark the hours of the day. These are four in number - the "Kaala Santhi", early in the morning, the "Ucchikālam", in the afternoon, the "Sāyaratchai", in the evening and the "Ardha Jāmam", at night, immediately prior to the temple being closed for the day.
Each ritual comprises four steps: abishegam (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) all the deities. After the abishegam, it is the practice to dress the idols of the deities, in an act called "alangaram", in one of several guises. The worship is held with religious instructions in the Vedas (Sanskrit sacred texts) and Thirumurai (Tamil sacred texts) read by priests. These hours are marked by the tolling of the bell of the temple amidst music with nadaswaram (pipe instrument) and thavil (percussion instrument).
Devotees are able to perform archanai by the priest thereafter.
History.
The tropical island of Penang lies in the Indian Ocean, just off the north-west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Penang's rapid growth as a trading hub in the early 19th century, especially in commodities such as nutmegs, cloves, and pepper, attracted traders from Europe, America, Arabia, India as well as China. Each then established communities and adopted lifestyles similar to their homeland. It was during that time that the Tamil Indians arrived in the island's bustling harbour, and established their own Little India community in the city. The early Indian settlers, who came to this island to toil and trade, established an abode for mother, so that her presence could be felt as their guardian deity and guide in their times of trials and tribulations.
Dating back as early as 1801, the Sri Mahamariamman Temple is recognised as an elaborate and spiritual place of worship. Like most Indian temples in Penang, the Penang Sri Mahamariamman began as a small and simple shrine. Not much is known about the early days of the temple or of the persons who founded it. The land was granted in 1801 by the British to Betty Lingam Chetty, who was then the Kapitan (Headman, Kepala or Community Leader) of the Tamils and South Indians. This is confirmed by another grant written in 1831. But, as to how the temple came to be built on this land or who founded it, there is no information.
Caption James Low confirms the existence of a temple in Georgetown in 1835. That the Mariamman temple was founded in 1833 is first mentioned in a notice of 'Kumbabishegam' (consecration ceremony) held one hundred years later in 1933. But except for the date, not much else has been said about its founding in that document.
Built originally as a shrine, it was later that the Indian community found a need for a proper temple ground for worshipping, to accommodate the ever-increasing Indian community presence on the island. This was done to ensure that the Indian community, which includes the merchants, labourers and sepoys, are settled in one particular area, for ease of managing the group. The majority of the people who lived around the temple were waterfront workers who were the backbone of the Penang port. These Indian stevedores were organised in groups called kootam – a member of a kootam is a kootakadai, and heading each kootam is a thandal. Together, the Indian community numbered about 2000 workers and they inhabited the area bounded by Lebuh Queen, Lebuh King, Lebuh Penang, Lebuh Pasar and Lebuh Gereja, an area collectively known as Ellammuchanthi in Tamil, or Simpang Lelong in Malay.
The Sri Mahamariamman shrine was enlarged into a temple in 1833. Since this was when it became a proper temple, 1833 is taken as the year that it was founded. At the time of its founding, it was known as the Sri Muthu Mariamman Temple. It was only in 1980 that it became known by its present name, Sri Arulmigu Mahamariamman Temple, although the name is often written as Sri Mariamman Temple, Mahamariamman Temple and so on.
From its inception, the temple provided an important place of worship for early Indian immigrants and is now an important cultural and national heritage. In those days, it was done to ensure the Indian community, which includes the early working settlers like merchants and labourers are settled in one area to ease managing them. By 1833, the shrine through the efforts of the Indian settlers, turned to a temple and was renovated to its present form a hundred years later.
According to a document of civil suit brought before the courts in 1904, the names of five trustees who looked after the temple from 1892 till 1904 are Veerasamy, Murugan Chettiyar, Govindasamy Pillai, Veleritta Taver and Meyappah. The temple came under The Mohamedan and Hindu Endowments Board in 1906. From then onwards the temple has been administrated by the management committee appointed by the Endowment Board. It appears that from the beginning of the Endowments Board's administration, a few temples and other institutions have been clustered and left under the care of this management committee: Arulmigu Sri Balathandayuthapani Temple in Waterfall (Hilltop), the Arulmigu Sri Ganesha Temple in Waterfall, the Arulmigu Sri Mahamariamman Temple in Queen Street, Hindu Cemetery and Cremation Ground in Batu Lanchang and a Hindu Funeral Rites Ground in Jalan Air Itam. From 1967 onwards, the board is known as the Hindu Endowments Board, which is currently managing this temple.
Hindu Mahajana Sangam.
The Hindu Mahajana Sangam () which was formed in 1935, has had close association with this temple and other temples under the care of the same management. Before 1935, it was known as Kootakkadai (). Many members have served in both institutions. They have also been associated with the temple's formation, renovation and maintenance. The festivals conducted by the Hindu Mahajana Sangam such as Chitraparuvam, Vijayadhsami and Aatakavadi during Thaipoosam is associated with this temple.
First Kumbabishegam (1933).
It was in 1933 that the temple acquired the present form and structure. In that year the temple was extensively renovated. According to the notice of the consecration ceremony, the foundation stone for the new structure was laid by Mr. V. Natesam Pillay, JP. The Sri Muthu Mariamman temple having become too small and too decayed, the Hindu gentlemen of Penang, with their initiative and perseverance, have bought up two buildings to the north of the temple, expanded the presence space and formed a temple in accordance with the Siva agamas a sanctum, Arthamandapam (antechamber), Mahamandapam (hall), "prakaram" (circumambient), vimanam (dome), surrounding walls and Rajagopuram (entrance tower). These renovations were carried out by a management committee consisting of S. Ekamparam Pillai, C. Subbaraya Pillay, S. P. Natesam Pillay, P. Kalimuthu Vandayar, K. V. Karuppiah Thandal and M. R. Raju.
The consecration ceremony was held on Sunday, 12 June 1933.
Second Kumbabishegam (1958).
It is also known that further repairs were done in 1958 and a consecration ceremony, albeit on a small scale was carried out under the leadership of Mr. Doraisamy Thevar JP PJK who was the chairman of the temple management committee.
Third Kumbabishegam (1980).
Since 1958, no repairs or renovations were done to the temple. This caused some serious decay to the structures and sculptures. From 1978 till 1980, extensive renovation was done. A sculptor from the Academy of Sculptors in Mahapalipuram, Chennai and two assistant sculptors were brought from India to restore the structure. Although the basic form of the 1933 structure had been retained, many new areas have been added. A new hall 31 feet × 27 feet, suitable for small religious functions, has been added and over this, another story has been added for administrative offices.
While most of the sculptures have been preserved, some new ones have also been added, the statues of the nine forms of Sakthi now surround the outer walls of the sanctum. The inner walls of the sanctum, antechamber and the flooring of the whole temple have been changed. The entire temple has been repainted. The smaller shrines of Visvanathar, Visalatchi, Chandikeswarar and Bairavar have domes of their own which have been gold plated. Within the sanctum, a new statue of Mahamariamman, towering over the main deity, has been formed. At the feet of the main deity, a Sri Chakram has also been erected. A Vishnu Dhurga idol was newly installed.
The temple's name which was known as Sri Muthu Mariamman Temple till then was changed to Arulmigu Sri Mahamariamman Temple.
The consecration ceremony was held on Sunday, 14 December 1980.
Fourth Kumbabishegam (1998).
The present renovation was begun in mid-1997. While basically preserving the existing temple structure, some minor modifications were made such as replacing of tiles in the sanctum and the whole temple flooring, replacing the peedam in the sanctum, replacing the Komugi, a new Ganesha, Visveswarar, Rahu and Kethu icons, new Navagraha peedam, new flag post with concrete base, statues of Bala Ganesha and Bala Murugan, Ashta Lakshmi 8 statues and two lion statues on the left and right of the temple main entrance. The Bairavar shrine is moved to the north-east corner, facing south.
The consecration ceremony was held on Thursday, 3 September 1998.
Fifth Kumbabishegam (2016).
The present renovation was begun in end of 2013. The ceremony took place from 14th till 15 November 2013, involved the removing of the deities from the main shrines to a temporary site (balaalayam) within the temple and was the beginning of the many rituals to prepare for the consecration ceremony. The process was divided into five stages. After procuring connection of all necessary services to the site, the first stage of the project, breaking the wall and floor tiles commenced. This was followed by the reinforced concrete work to the foundations, slabs, columns and so forth. Construction activities continued with the erection of roof steel frames. Electrical and plumbing conduits. A team of artisans arrived from India and commenced work on the shrines. Another batch of additional artisans arrived from India to accelerate the pace of construction in order to meet the consecration ceremony deadline.
While basically preserving the existing temple structure, the inner walls of the sanctum, antechamber and the flooring of the whole temple have been changed. The entire temple has been repainted. New icons replacing the older ones are Thatchinamoorthy, Visalatchi, Chandikeswarar, Bairavar and Navagraham are installed. Nandhi and bali peedam icons installed facing east towards Visveswarar shrine are added. A gold plated new flag post with granite concrete base is added along with Kodimara Pillayar icon facing east are installed. Statues of Ganesha and Murugan statues on the left and right of the outer wall of temple main entrance. The wooden framework on the century-old ceiling known as "Raasi Kattam" (the 12 zodiac signs planets carved on the wood) is also restored. The Bairavar shrine is moved back to its original location on the left-hand side of the main entrance, facing west.
The consecration ceremony was held on Sunday, 10 July 2016.
Architecture.
Built in the south Indian Dravidian style, the temple most outstanding feature is the impressive "gopuram" (tower). Rising above the entrance, it features Hindu deities, soldiers and floral decorations.
On the entrance of Penang Sri Mariamman Temple, you get to see a 23.5 feet tall sculptured tower or "Gopuram". Also, the 38 statues of Gods and Goddesses and 4 swans featuring the Hindu Goddess Mahamariamman in Her many incarnations such as Meenatchi, Kamatchi, Visalatchi, Bhuvaneswari surrounds the colourful four-tiered crown. It is topped with five small kalasams.
With subsequent renovations carried out over the years by Hindus artisans and sculptors from India and locals, from makeshift huts to heavily ornate and brightly shining with diamonds and precious stones, Penang Sri Mahariamman Temple is a sight to behold.
The interiors of the temples are heavily sculptured with deities of Lord Ganesha is in the left pillar and Lord Muruga, his brother, is on the right pillar. The eight female figures adorning the pillars inside the temple are of Ashta Lakshmi (Goddess of Wealth). On the left wall there are sculptures of the Nadaraja and Sivakami in dancing posture of the cosmic dance. Nine statues of goddesses (9 types of Sakthi) can be seen on the walls surrounding the inner shrine of Penang Sri Mahamariamman Temple.

The Deity.
Mariamman is popularly worshipped by overseas Indians, especially Tamils because she is looked upon as their protector. She is the Goddess of disease, rain and protection and is associated with enormous powers in the physical realm, particularly destructive, and protects her devotees from unholy or demonic events.
Historians claimed that the worship of Mariamman or Korravai/Kotravai started as a tribal religion of the Dravidians. Mariamman is a manifestation of the goddess - Parvati, an incarnation embodying Mother Earth with all her terrifying force.
In the Hindu pantheon, however, the original mother form of the Maha Sakthi is the Primal Source of All Energy - from where everything - all matter and energy comes. The Sakthi is credited with the creation of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, the three main gods of creation, sustenance and destruction.
The word Mariamman comes from two words: "Mari" meaning "power" and "amman" meaning "mother". "Maha" stands for "great". So this Mahamariamman temple tells you, it houses the great powerful mother. And some Indians considers Sri Mariamman to be the mother of Lord Ganesha and Lord Muruga. So to many locals, when asks which temple they are going, some simply said "Amman Temple".
Mahamariamman, the primary deity is seated at the "moolastanam" (sanctum) of the "karuvarai" (sanctum sanctorum) facing east. Ganesha and Subramaniyaswami are installed at the "artha mandapam" (antechamber) facing east. There is a surrounding circumambulatory path. At the "mukha mandapam" we may find the "vahana" (mythical mount/vehicle) of the Goddess which is lion, the "bali peedam" (sacrificial altar) and the "kodi maram" (flag post) is also found facing west towards Mahamariamman. Stone carvings of the cosmic dance of Lord Nadaraja and His consort Goddess Sivakami are found at the wall facing south at the "vasantha mandapam" (festive hall).
Shrines for sub deities facing east are Lord Visveswarar and Goddess Visalatchi are installed at the left and right side of the sanctum sanctorum respectively. The shrine of Lord Chandikeswarar is facing south towards the sanctum sanctorum. The shrine of Lord Bairavar is found at the northeast corner facing west. Lord Thatchinamoorthy facing south and Vishnu Dhurga facing north are installed at the outer wall of the sanctum sanctorum. The Navagraham (nine planets) are found at the northeast corner of the temple.
Housed within its ornately decorated interior is the priceless "panchaloha" (an alloy of five metals: gold, silver, copper, zinc and tin) statue of Lord Ganesha, Lord Subramaniyaswami and Mahamariamman embellished with gold, silver, diamonds and emeralds.
The priceless Goddess Mahamariamman's statue is paraded on a wooden chariot during the Vijayadashami day on the end of the Navarathiri festival.
The priceless Lord Subramaniaswamy's statue figures prominently in the annual Chithra Pournami festival when it is borne on a wooden chariot through the city streets to the Arulmigu Sri Balathandayuthapani Hilltop temple in Waterfall, Penang.
Festivals.
The temple is particularly packed on Navarathiri, Chithra Pournami, Deepavali and Thaipusam with thousands of devotees eager to offer their prayers on the holy days.
In the year 2008, there was a big celebration commemorating the temple's 175th anniversary.
Navarathiri.
The most auspicious event for the temple is the Navarathiri festival. The festival begins with the lion flag-raising ceremony and ends with a procession where the Panchaloha () deity of Mahamariamman is paraded in a decorated wooden chariot through the streets of Little India. Navarathiri is nine nights vegetarian festival. According to the Hindu Puranas, the festival is held to commemorate the victory of Goddess Adi Parashakti over the demon king Mahishasuran. It was stated that the evil king ill-treated the people that they turned to the goddess, who is the consort of Lord Shiva, to save them. Goddess Adi Parasakthi fought a battle for nine days and ultimately destroyed him on the 10th day, which is known as Vijayadashami.
Various Indian organisations and communities would sponsor the prayers for each nights. On the Final tenth day of the celebration, Vijayadashami is celebrated by Hindu Mahajana Sangam. The sangam organised the chariot procession for many years from Queen Street, Sri Mahamariamman Temple to Dhoby Ghaut. The festival celebration is concluded after shooting of arrows from the chariot in the evening in the Dhoby Ghaut. The chariot returns to the temple at about midnight the same day. Since the late 1970s, the organisation of the chariot procession had been taken over from the sangam by the Temple committee and the Hindu Endowments Board. The chariot procession is now confined to Fort Cornwallis area, nearby the Kedah Pier Muneeswarar Temple in the Esplanade. However, the sangam still continues to celebrate the annual Navarathiri festival's final tenth day Vijayadashami Ubayam every year without fail.
Chithra Pournami (Chitraparuvam).
The Hindu Mahajana Sangam, with notable among the festivals, the annual Chitraparuvam Festival which is celebrated in the Tamil month of Chithirai (April/May) every year, is organised with a chariot procession of the "panchaloha" deity of Lord Subramaniyaswami from Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman Temple. It is the day of the first full moon of the first Tamil month. In early years, the festival starts with special pooja and ubayam for the Hindu Mahajana Sangam "Koota Kadai" in Queen Street Mahamariamman Temple, the chariot procession commences in the early morning 7.00 am and reached Waterfall Dewan Mahatma Gandhi (Gandhiji Ashram) in the afternoon, the deity then carried and placed in the ashram until the return journey of the chariot to Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple in the evening of the same day.
Since the early 1970s this festival is celebrated for three days. The deity of Lord Subramaiyaswami is brought in procession from the Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple passing through many street and roads before reaching the Waterfall Arulmigu Sri Ganesha temple. The deity is carried up to the Hilltop Arulmigu Sri Balathadayuthapani Temple. On the second day is the Chitraparuvam Festival where the deity is taken in procession around the hilltop temple compound in the evening. On the third day evening, the deity is carried down and placed on the chariot procession journey back to the Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple. In 1992, the Hindu Mahajana Sangam imported a new chariot from India, for the annual Chitraparuvam Festival celebration to replace the old chariot which was found to be not road worthy and in a decaying condition.
On the first day, the chariot passes through Queen Street, Chulia Street, Chulia Street Ghaut, Victoria Street, Prangin Road Ghaut, C. Y. Choy Road, Magazine Road, Dato Keramat Road, Western Road and Waterfall Road before reaching the Ganesar Temple. The chariot stops at Kamatchi Amman Temple, Sivan Temple and Muneeswarar Temple along the way. Then the Lord Subramaniyaswami is carried up to the Sri Balathandayuthapani Temple at the hilltop.
On the return journey, the Lord Subramaniyaswami is carried down and the chariot passes through Waterfall Road, Gottlieb Road, Tunku Abdul Rahman Road, Macalister Road, Anson Road, Burma Road, Transfer Road, Sri Bahari Road, Penang Road, Kimberley Street, Carnarvon Street, Chulia Street, Pitt Street, Church Street, Queen Street, China Street, King Street, Light Street, Penang Street, Chulia Street, King Street, China Street, Beach Street, Market Street and Queen Street before reaching the Sri Mahamariamman Temple.

Atta Kavadi.
The Hindu Mahajana Sangam members carry a traditional kavadi weighing approximately 80 kilos known as "Atta Kavadi" since 1927 from Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple in the evening to Dewan Mahatma Gandhi in the Arulmigu Balathandayuthapani Temple, Penang compound with traditional Nadhaswaram accompanying the Atta Kavadi. A late-night dinner is served in the Dewan Mahatma Gandhi after the arrival of the Atta Kavadi. In the early years, the arrival of the Atta Kavadi signified the conclusion of the annual Thaipusam festival celebration for the day and devotees are not expected to carry any kavadi after the Atta Kavadi reaches the Waterfall temple compound.
Kuthirai Vahanam.
The Penang Nattukottai Chettiar community hold prayers in this temple prior to the Thaipusam festival. This function is called the "Kuthirai Vahanam" (Horse Car) held on in the Tamil month of Markazhi (December/January). The prayers would start 10 days earlier where there would be ubayams on these days. On the tenth day, the decorated "panchaloha" deity of the Mahamariamman which carries a Vel would be placed on the Horse Car. The procession begins from Queen Street at the evening, displaying the Vel passing through various streets and roads and end up at Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple around midnight.
Golden Chariot.
A RM3mil golden chariot hit the streets on the eve of Thaipusam on 8 February 2017. The 1.6-tonne golden chariot measuring 4.3m-high and 4m-wide will feature two golden horses in the front with several statues adorning the kalasam (tower). The chariot bearing Lord Muruga's vel (spear) will move on rubberised wheels pulled by devotees. The inner frame of the chariot was made in Karaikudi and shipped to Penang, where it was assembled.
The golden chariot's journey will be from the Arulmigu Sri Maha Mariamman Temple in Queen Street to the Arulmigu Sri Ganesha Temple in Jalan Kebun Bunga. The chariot would be placed at the Sri Ganesha Temple for two days, on Thaipusam eve and on Thaipusam day.
An 18-day pooja (special prayers) session will be conducted for The 0.9m-tall golden vel at Queen Street Maha Mariamman Temple. This depicts the story goes that the vel was created by Lord Shiva's consort Parasakthi who is also Lord Murugan's mother. Parasakthi appeared in 18 forms before merging into a single indestructible vel which was handed to Lord Murugan during the Poosa natchathiram on Pournami Day (full moon) in the month of Thai (January to February). After receiving a blessing from the Lord's mother, the vel will be sent back to Lord Murugan on the golden chariot on Thaipusam eve.
The golden chariot successfully completed its first trial run for Thaipusam in on 2 February 2017 about two hours through George Town in the presence of a large throng of devotees seeing it for the first time.

Marlboro Cup Invitational Handicap

The Marlboro Cup Invitational Handicap was a Thoroughbred horse race first run in September 1973 at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. A Grade 1 race for horses 3 years old and up, it was raced over a distance of miles on a dirt track.
The race came into existence as a result of the huge popularity of Secretariat, who in 1973 became the first U.S. Triple Crown champion in twenty-five years. Such was the drawing power of Secretariat that CBS television readily agreed to broadcast the race nationally, a rare occurrence at the time for a non-Triple Crown or traditional "classic" event (such as the Travers Stakes). Originally conceived as a match race with Secretariat's stablemate and 1972 Kentucky Derby winner Riva Ridge, it was changed to an invitational race that brought together the top horses 3 years of age and older.
In the inaugural race, Secretariat set a world record time for miles on dirt while winning by lengths on a track officially rated as being only "good". The race became a very important annual event and 1978 marked the first of only two times in racing history that two American Triple Crown winners met in a single race, with Seattle Slew, the 1977 champion, defeating the 1978 champion Affirmed by three lengths. (The two met again in that year's edition of the Jockey Club Gold Cup; Seattle Slew lost by a nose to Exceller, while Affirmed finished up the track due to a slipped saddle.)
For many years the Marlboro Cup was part of Belmont Park's Fall Championship meet and the track's owner, the New York Racing Association, created a Fall Championship Series consisting of the Woodward Stakes, followed by the Marlboro Cup, and then the Jockey Club Gold Cup.

Evangeline Trail

The Evangeline Trail is a scenic roadway in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.
It is located in the western part of the province, bringing visitors to the Minas Basin, the Annapolis Valley and the Gulf of Maine. The route connects Mount Uniacke in Hants County with Yarmouth at the Bay Ferries terminal where ferries connect to Maine in the United States.
The route measures .
Name.
Traveling through many communities in which Acadians once made their homes and still do, the route is named after the principal character in the epic poem "Evangeline" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The region from Yarmouth to Halifax via the Annapolis Valley was first connected by the Dominion Atlantic Railway, which is credited with instigating the province's nascent tourism industry during the early 20th century; the DAR was titled "The Land of Evangeline Route" and the Evangeline Trail pays homage to this transport predecessor.

Cape Cod Commission

The Cape Cod Commission is a regional planning authority and department of Barnstable County. It was created in 1990 by an Act of the Massachusetts General Court and confirmed by a majority of county voters.
In the wake of an unprecedented growth boom in the 1980s, the Cape Cod Commission Act found that the region known as Cape Cod (a geographic region largely co-extensive with Barnstable County) possesses unique natural, coastal, historical, cultural and other values which are threatened by uncoordinated or inappropriate uses of the region's land and other resources.
The Commission was established as a regional planning and regulatory agency to prepare and implement a regional land use policy plan for all of Cape Cod, review and regulate Developments of Regional Impact, and recommend designation of certain areas as Districts of Critical Planning Concern. It is funded by the Cape Cod Environmental Protection Fund.
Commission composition.
The Commission is made up of 19 members representing each of Barnstable County's 15 towns as well as the County Commissioners, minorities, Native Americans, and a governor's appointee. The members are citizen volunteers who guide a professional staff to plan for Cape Cod's future growth, provide technical assistance to towns, review and vote on major developments, and act as the Commission's liaison to their communities.
Commission planners and technical staff have expertise in a wide variety of areas including: landscape architecture, land use planning, economic development, affordable housing, historic preservation, wetland and wildlife resources, water resources, coastal resources, waste management, transportation planning, and computer mapping.
The Commission's work is divided into three major areas: planning and community development, technical services, and regulation.

Brazeau River

The Brazeau River is a river in western Alberta, Canada. It is a major tributary of the North Saskatchewan River.
The river was named for Joseph Brazeau, a linguist associated with the Palliser Expedition.
Course.
The river originates in the heights of the Canadian Rockies from Cataract Pass on the south boundary of Jasper National Park. It flows northeast into Brazeau Canyon Wildland Provincial Park. The O'Chiese First Nation is established at the confluence with Nordegg River. It merges into the North Saskatchewan River between Drayton Valley and Rocky Mountain House at Brazeau Forks.
The total length of the river is . The river, and various other local geographic features, were named after Joseph Brazeau, a Missouri-born fur trader working for the Hudson's Bay Company in the area between 1852 and 1864.
Hydroelectric development.
The Brazeau River has long been seen as a potential site for hydroelectric power generation. The earliest scheme to harness the power of the river was hatched in 1913 and involved a dam and storage on Brazeau Lake. The potential power generation was estimated at 5,000 to 10,000 kilovolt-amperes, and power would have been transmitted to Edmonton and Calgary, both roughly from the generator (this was a relatively ambitious plan: long-distance transmission was not common at the time). The plan was scuttled after the discovery of a large underflow at Brazeau Lake, precluding its use as a storage facility.
The Brazeau Reservoir was created on the lower course through the construction of the Brazeau Dam. Its hydroelectric power plant is Alberta's largest, with a capacity of 355 megawatts and an annual production of about 394,000 megawatt hours of electrical energy.
An unusual feature of this hydroelectric development, commissioned in 1965, is a pump system capable of lifting water from the reservoir into the long canal leading to the power plant so that it can operate at low reservoir water levels.

Household Saints

Household Saints is a 1993 film starring Tracey Ullman, Vincent D'Onofrio and Lili Taylor. It is based on the novel by Francine Prose and directed by Nancy Savoca. The film explores the lives of three generations of Italian-American women over the course of the latter half of the 20th century. The film's executive producer is Jonathan Demme, a long-time friend of Savoca's, and her first real employer in the world of film. In 2023, the film received a 4K restoration from Milestone Films, who later gave the film a theatrical release.
Plot.
The film follows three generations of a New York Italian American family, beginning in the 1950s with the courtship and marriage of Catherine Falconetti to local butcher Joseph Santangelo, who wins her hand after beating her father in a game of pinocle. The first half focuses on Catherine adjusting to her new life as a mother and housewife, as well as her strained relationship with her overbearing Old World mother-in-law, Carmela.
The second half focuses on Catherine and Joseph's daughter Teresa, a devout Catholic more similar to her superstitious grandmother than her modernized and secularized parents. As a child and young adult, Teresa puts herself through a series of trials so that she might one day be canonized as a saint. Her desire to become a nun is challenged, however, when she becomes involved with Leonard, an ambitious young man who wishes to marry her.
The film explores both family dynamics over the course of time as well as, on a larger level, the relationship between religious faith in miracles and modernity.
Production.
Nancy Savoca cast many favorite New York City actors for the film which was shot in DeLaurentis/Carolco (now EUE Screen Gems) Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. The film reunited Lili Taylor with Savoca, with whom she'd previously worked on "Dogfight," and Vincent D'Onofrio, with whom she'd appeared in 1988's "Mystic Pizza."
Tracey Ullman and Vincent D'Onofrio, as Lili Taylor's screen parents, are only eight years older than she is.
Release.
Although the film was met with critical success on release, it had only been released on VHS and remained out of print for years.
In 2023, it was announced that Milestone Films had acquired distribution rights to the film, and that a new restoration would have its world premiere at that year's New York Film Festival, preceded by Savoca's 1982 student short "Renata". The 4K restoration began a limited theatrical run in January 2024.
Finally, in April 2024, Kino Lorber released this 4K restoration on both DVD and Blu-ray.
Reception.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, "Household Saints" has an approval rating of 72% based on 18 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and called it a "warm-hearted jewel of a movie" with many scenes that rang true to his Catholic upbringing. He added: 
Accolades.
The film made "The New York Times"' Best Films of 1993 list. It was nominated for a Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay by Nancy Savoca and Richard Guay. Lili Taylor won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female.

The Secret in the Old Attic

The Secret in the Old Attic is the twenty-first volume in the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series. It was first published in 1944 under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. The actual author was ghostwriter Mildred Wirt Benson.
Plot Summary- 1944 edition.
Nancy searches for clues to missing music manuscripts written by the late soldier Philip March. March's daughter and his father, living together on the family estate, are rapidly running out of money, and believe some of Philip's music is being sold and played on the radio. Nancy goes to his estate, Pleasant Hedges, to investigate, with the assistance of her good friends, Bess and George. They search the estate, for clues, and also find valuable antiques that they sell for Mr. March so he can get some money in the meantime. Also, her father's client, Mr. Booker, solicits her aid in his investigation of a rival company, the Dight plant, which seems to be manufacturing silk cloth using his patented methods. And what is Bushy Trott, a manic scientist, doing at the Dight plant?
There is also a subplot in the original text in which Nancy is confused as to why Ned hasn't asked her out to a dance. It turns out that Diane Dight, daughter of the owner of the Dight plant, intercepts his communication asking Nancy out so that she can date Ned and another boy, also involved in the mystery, can date Nancy. At the end, Nancy is caught by the villain. He ties her up and gags her, imprisoning her in a room with a spider the book identifies as a venomous tarantula, about to give her a deadly bite. But Ned and Effie Schnieder, the maid, rescue her just in time. Nancy and Ned figure out how they were tricked, and make up.
Nancy continues trying to solve both mysteries, discovering hidden songs in the process. The resolution of both cases are quite climactic.
1970 revision.
The revised version, still in print, is a condensed version of the original story, which has 20 chapters instead of 25. The story is largely similar to the original, with Mr. March looking for his son's songs that were composed but never published, so he can sell them for money to raise his granddaughter, Susan. Nancy helps find the missing music and another part introduces that Nancy goes to a factory that she thinks is copying a formula for silk. At the end Nancy, is about to be bitten by a black widow spider but she is saved by Ned Nickerson. The revised text does include Diane Dight, but does not have the romantic subplot of the original edition.
Artwork.
Collectors of the series seem to greatly enjoy the original art by Russell H. Tandy, which depicts Nancy among highly Gothic elements, by candlelight, in the old attic. In 1962, Rudy Nappi gave Nancy a modern flip hairstyle and changed the color to red, and altered her shirtwaist wrap dress to a generic red sailor-style dress for the cover art. In 1970, Nappi updated his art, employing a shadowy apple green color motif and Gothic elements, including the skeletal hand, to showcase Nancy, looking very much like Barbara Eden in a coatfront shift, with a candle. This cover plays heavily on the spooky elements popular during the "Dark Shadows" era.
Television.
A reference to the book is made in the pilot episode of the "Nancy Drew" television series. Nancy searched through her family's attic to discover a bloody dress inside a trunk. The visual of Nancy opening the trunk to find the dress looks strikingly similar to the cover of the novel.

Ruth Stonehouse

Ruth Stonehouse (September 28, 1892 – May 12, 1941) was an actress and film director during the silent film era. Her stage career started at the age of eight as a dancer in Arizona shows.
Early life.
Ruth Stonehouse was born to James Wesley Stonehouse and Georgia C. Worster on September 28, 1892, in Denver, Colorado. Her father was the founder of Stonehouse Signs Inc. According to the 1900 Census for Laurence Town, Teller County, Colorado, she lived with her father, James, a sign writer, and her grandmother, Eda Stonehouse, along with her sister, Hazel, who was a year younger. By 1910, she was living with her mother, Georgia Stonehouse, a stenographer, and her sister, Hazel, in Chicago, Illinois. Curiously, her mother lists herself as a widow on the 1910 Census, while James Stonehouse can be found residing in Arizona. 
Film career.
Stonehouse worked for Triangle Film Corporation and Universal Pictures during a career which extended from 1911 until 1928. A few years prior in 1907, she was a founding member of Essanay Film Manufacturing Company. She also signed on to work on Cyrus J. Williams' productions. Having experience here helped Stonehouse begin her directing career later on as she moved to different stations. Her androgynous appearance was most apparent in the role of "Nancy Glenn" and in the 1917 motion picture, "The Edge of the Law". She performed in comedies and dramas such as the patriotic film "Doing Her Bit" (1917), which was directed by Jack Conway. 
In 1917, Stonehouse directed the films "Daredevil Dan", "A Walloping Time", "The Winning Pair", "A Limb of Satan", "Puppy Love", and "Tacky Sue's Romance". These movies were one-reel "orphan asylum pictures", the first of which was entitled "Mary Ann".
Personal life.
Stonehouse owned a cabin in Santa Anita Canyon in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Here she entertained men and women of prominence in the film world, cooking culinary masterpieces which her friends deemed superior to most chefs. Stonehouse was a fan of the Owen Magnetic Auto and promoted it in newspapers. Stonehouse was an avid gardener who grew fibrous-rooted begonias, pleromas, fuchsias, cinerias, and hyacinths. Her home, located at 204 North Rossmore Avenue in Los Angeles, California, was an adaptation of a Spanish design that was situated well to the front of a large lot. She was an active worker in the Children's Home Society for twenty-five years and also a member of the Garden Club of California.
Death.
Stonehouse died in Hollywood, California of a cerebral hemorrhage on May 12, 1941, at the age of 48. She was listed as Mrs. Felix Hughes in her obituary. Her funeral services were conducted from Wee Kirk o' the Heather. She was interred in a mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

Asiatic cheetah

The Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) is a critically endangered cheetah subspecies currently only surviving in Iran. Its range once spread from the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East to the Caspian region, Transcaucasus, Kyzylkum Desert and northern South Asia, but was extirpated in these regions during the 20th century. The Asiatic cheetah diverged from the cheetah population in Africa between 32,000 and 67,000 years ago. 
The Asiatic cheetah survives in protected areas in the eastern-central arid region of Iran, where the human population density is very low. Between December 2011 and November 2013, 84 individuals were sighted in 14 different protected areas, and 82 individuals were identified from camera trap photographs. In December 2017, fewer than 50 individuals were thought to be remaining in three subpopulations that are scattered over in Iran's central plateau. As of April 2024, five Asiatic cheetahs reside in a breeding facility in the country.
Taxonomy.
"Felis venatica" was proposed by Edward Griffith in 1821 and based on a sketch of a maneless cheetah from India. Griffith's description was published in "Le Règne Animal" with the help of Griffith's assistant Charles Hamilton Smith in 1827.
"Acinonyx raddei" was proposed by in 1913 for the cheetah population in Central Asia, the Trans-Caspian cheetah. Hilzheimer's type specimen originated in Merv, Turkmenistan.
Evolution.
Results of a five-year phylogeographic study on cheetah subspecies indicate that Asiatic and African cheetah populations separated between 32,000 and 67,000 years ago and are genetically distinct. Samples of 94 cheetahs for extracting mitochondrial DNA were collected in nine countries from wild, seized and captive individuals and from museum specimen. The population in Iran is considered autochthonous monophyletic and the last remaining representative of the Asiatic subspecies.
Mitochondrial DNA fragments of an Indian and a Southeast African cheetah museum specimens showed that they genetically diverged about 72,000 years ago.
Characteristics.
The Asiatic cheetah has a buff-to-light fawn-coloured fur that is paler on the sides, on the front of the muzzle, below the eyes and inner legs. Small black spots are arranged in lines on the head and nape, but irregularly scattered on body, legs, paws and tail. The tail tip has black stripes. The coat and mane are shorter than of African cheetah subspecies. The head and body of an adult Asiatic cheetah measure about with a long tail. It weighs about . They exhibit sexual dimorphism; males are slightly larger than the females.
The cheetah is the fastest land animal in the world. It was previously thought that the body temperature of a cheetah increases during a hunt due to high metabolic activity. In a short period of time during a chase, a cheetah may produce 60 times more heat than at rest, with much of the heat, produced from glycolysis, stored to possibly raise the body temperature. The claim was supported by data from experiments in which two cheetahs ran on a treadmill for minutes on end but contradicted by studies in natural settings, which indicate that body temperature stays relatively the same during a hunt. A 2013 study suggested stress hyperthermia and a slight increase in body temperature after a hunt. The cheetah's nervousness after a hunt may induce stress hyperthermia, which involves high sympathetic nervous activity and raises the body temperature. After a hunt, the risk of another predator taking its kill is great, and the cheetah is on high alert and stressed. The increased sympathetic activity prepares the cheetah's body to run when another predator approaches. In the 2013 study, even the cheetah that did not chase the prey experienced an increase in body temperature once the prey was caught, showing increased sympathetic activity.
Distribution and habitat.
The cheetah thrives in open lands, small plains, semi-desert areas, and other open habitats where prey is available. The Asiatic cheetah mainly inhabits the desert areas around Dasht-e Kavir in the eastern half of Iran, including parts of the Kerman, Khorasan, Semnan, Yazd, Tehran, and Markazi provinces. Most live in five protected areas, viz Kavir National Park, Touran National Park, Bafq Protected Area, Dar-e Anjir Wildlife Refuge, and Naybandan Wildlife Reserve.
During the 1970s, the Asiatic cheetah population in Iran was estimated to number about 200 individuals in 11 protected areas. By the end of the 1990s, the population was estimated at 50 to 100 individuals.
During camera-trapping surveys conducted across 18 protected areas between 2001 and 2012, a total of 82 individuals in 15–17 families were recorded and identified. Of these, only six individuals were recorded for more than three years. In this period, 42 cheetahs died due to poaching, in road accidents and due to natural causes. Populations are fragmented and known to survive in the Semnan, North Khorasan, South Khorasan, Yazd, Esfahan, and Kerman Provinces.
In summer 2018, a female cheetah and four cubs were sighted in Touran Wildlife Refuge Iran's Semnan province.
Former range.
The Asiatic cheetah once ranged from the Arabian Peninsula and Near East to Iran, the Caucasus, Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan to India. Bronze Age remains are known from Troy in western Anatolia and Armenia.
It is considered locally extinct in all of its former range, with the only known surviving population being Iran.
In Iraq, the cheetah was still recorded in the desert west of Basrah in 1926, and a cheetah killed by a car in 1947 or 1948 was the last known incidence in the county. Two cheetahs were killed in the Ḥaʼil Province of northern Saudi Arabia in 1973. In the Arabian Peninsula, it used to occur in the northern and southeastern fringes and had been reported in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before 1974. In Yemen, the last known cheetah was sighted in Wadi Mitan in 1963, near the international border with Oman. In Oman's Dhofar Mountains, a cheetah was shot near Jibjat in 1977.
In Central Asia, uncontrolled hunting of cheetahs and their prey, severe winters and conversion of grassland to areas used for agriculture contributed to the population's decline. By the early 20th century, the range in Central Asia had decreased significantly. By the 1930s, cheetahs were confined to the Ustyurt plateau and Mangyshlak Peninsula in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and to the foothills of the Kopet Dag mountains and a region in the south of Turkmenistan bordering Iran and Afghanistan. The last known sightings in the area were in 1957 between the Tejen and Murghab Rivers, in July 1983 in the Ustyurt plateau, and in November 1984 in the Kopet Dag. Officers of the Badhyz State Nature Reserve did not sight a cheetah in this area until 2014; the border fence between Iran and Turkmenistan might impede dispersal.
The cheetah population in Afghanistan decreased to the extent that it has been considered extinct since the 1950s. Two skins were sighted in markets in the country, one in 1971, and another in 2006, the latter reportedly from Samangan Province.
In India, the cheetah occurred in Rajputana, Punjab, Sind, and south of the Ganges from Bengal to the northern part of the Deccan Plateau. It was also present in the Kaimur District, Darrah and other desert regions of Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat and Central India. Akbar was introduced to cheetahs around the mid-16th century and used them for coursing blackbucks, chinkaras and antelopes. He allegedly possessed 1,000 cheetahs during his reign but this figure might be exaggerated since there is no evidence of housing facilities for so many animals, nor of facilities to provide them with sufficient meat every day.
Trapping of adult cheetahs, who had already learned hunting skills from wild mothers, for assisting in royal hunts is said to be another major cause of the species' rapid decline in India, as there is only one record of a litter ever born to captive animals. By the beginning of the 20th century, wild Asiatic cheetahs sightings were rare in India, so much so that between 1918 and 1945, Indian princes imported cheetahs from Africa for coursing. Three of India's last cheetahs were shot by the Maharajah of Surguja in 1948. A female was sighted in 1951 in Koriya district, northwestern Chhattisgarh.
Ecology and behaviour.
Most sightings of cheetahs in the Miandasht Wildlife Refuge between January 2003 and March 2006 occurred during the day and near watercourses. These observations suggest that they are most active when their prey is.
Camera-trapping data obtained between 2009 and 2011 indicate that some cheetahs travel long distances. A female was recorded in two protected areas that are about apart and intersected by railway and two highways. Her three male siblings and a different adult male were recorded in three reserves, indicating that they have large home ranges.
Diet.
The Asiatic cheetah preys on medium-sized herbivores including chinkara, goitered gazelle, wild sheep, wild goat and cape hare. In Khar Turan National Park, cheetahs use a wide range of habitats, but prefer areas close to water sources. This habitat overlaps to 61% with wild sheep, 36% with onager, and 30% with gazelle.
In India, prey was formerly abundant. Before its extinction in the country, the cheetah fed on the blackbuck, the chinkara, and sometimes the chital and the nilgai.
Reproduction.
Evidence of females successfully raising cubs is scarce and breeding rarely occurs in captivity, which is also typical for other cheetah subspecies. A few observations in Iran indicate that they give birth throughout the year to one to four cubs. In April 2003, four cubs found in a den still had closed eyes. In November 2004, a cub was recorded by a camera-trap that was about 6–8 months old. Breeding success depends on availability of prey.
In October 2013, a female with four cubs were filmed in Khar Turan National Park. In December 2014, four cheetahs were sighted and photographed by camera traps in the same national park. In January 2015, three other adult Asiatic cheetahs and a female with her cub were sighted in Miandasht Wildlife Refuge. Eleven cheetahs were also sighted at the time, and another four a month later. In July 2015, five adult cheetahs and three cubs were spotted in Khar Turan National Park. A female Asiatic cheetah Khorshid has successfully raised three litters of cubs and is considered the most prolific living female as of 2024. Her daughter from the 2019 litter, Telma, gave birth in 2022.
Threats.
The Asiatic cheetah has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1996. Following the Iranian Revolution of 1979, wildlife conservation was interrupted for several years. Manoeuvres with armed vehicles were carried in steppes, and local people hunted cheetahs and prey species unchecked. The gazelle population declined in many areas, and cheetahs retreated to remote mountainous habitats.
Reduced gazelle numbers, persecution, land-use change, habitat degradation and fragmentation, and desertification contributed to the decline of the cheetah population. The cheetah is affected by loss of prey as a result of antelope hunting and overgrazing from introduced livestock. Its prey was pushed out as herders entered game reserves with their herds. A herder pursued a female cheetah with two cubs on his motorbike, until one of the cubs was so exhausted that it collapsed. He caught and kept it chained in his home for two weeks, until it was rescued by officers of the Iranian Department of Environment.
Mining development and road construction near reserves also threaten the population. Coal, copper, and iron have been mined in cheetah habitat in three different regions in central and eastern Iran. It is estimated that the two regions for coal (Nayband) and iron (Bafq) have the largest cheetah population outside protected areas. Mining itself is not a direct threat to the population; road construction and the resulting traffic have made the cheetah accessible to humans, including poachers. The Iranian border regions to Afghanistan and Pakistan, viz the Baluchistan Province, are major passages for armed outlaws and opium smugglers who are active in the central and western regions of Iran, and pass through cheetah habitat. Uncontrolled hunting throughout the desert cannot be effectively controlled by the governments of the three countries.
Conflict between livestock herders and cheetahs is also threatening the population outside protected areas. Several herders killed cheetahs to prevent livestock loss, or for trophies, trade and fun. Some herders are accompanied by large mastiff-type dogs into protected areas. These dogs killed five cheetahs between 2013 and 2016.
Between 2007 and 2011, six cheetahs, 13 predators and 12 Persian gazelles died in Yazd Province following collisions with vehicles on a transit road. At least 11 Asiatic cheetahs were killed in road accidents between 2001 and 2014. The road network in Iran constitutes a very high risk for the small population as it impedes connectivity between population units.
Efforts to stop the construction of a road through the core of the Bafq Protected Area were unsuccessful.
Between 1987 and 2018, 56 cheetahs died in Iran because of humans; 26 were killed by herders or their dogs.
Conservation.
In September 2001, the "Conservation of the Asiatic Cheetah and its Associated Biota" project was launched by the Iranian Department of Environment in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme's Global Environment Facility, the Wildlife Conservation Society, the IUCN Cat Specialist Group, the Cheetah Conservation Fund and the Iranian Cheetah Society.
Personnel of Wildlife Conservation Society and the Iranian Department of Environment started radio-collaring Asiatic cheetahs in February 2007. The cats' movements are monitored using GPS collars. Sanctions against Iran have made some projects, such as obtaining camera traps, difficult.
A few orphaned cubs have been raised in captivity, such as Marita who died at the age of nine years in 2003. Beginning in 2006, the day of his death, 31 August, became the Cheetah Conservation Day, used to inform the public about conservation programs.
In 2014, the Iran national football team announced that its 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 AFC Asian Cup kits are imprinted with pictures of the Asiatic cheetah in order to raise international awareness for its conservation. In February 2015, Iran launched a search engine, Yooz, that features a cheetah as the logo. The word "Yooz" translates to cheetah in some local languages and is deriative of "youzpalang", meaning cheetah in Persian. In May 2015, the Iranian Department of Environment announced plans to quintuple the penalty for poaching a cheetah to 100 million Iranian toman. In September 2015, Meraj Airlines introduced the new livery of Iranian Cheetah to support its conservation efforts. Iranian officials have discussed constructing wildlife crossings to reduce the number of deaths in traffic accidents.
In captivity.
In February 2010, photos of an Asiatic cheetah in a "Semi-Captive Breeding and Research Center of Iranian Cheetah" in Iran's Semnan province were published. Another news report stated that the centre is home to about ten Asiatic cheetahs in a semi-wild environment protected by wire fencing all around.
In January 2008, a male cub aged about 7–8 months was recovered from a sheep herder and brought into captivity. Wildlife officials in Miandasht Wildlife Refuge and the Turan National Park have raised a few orphaned cubs.
In 2014, an Asiatic cheetah was cloned for the first time by scientists from the University of Buenos Aires. The embryo was not born.
In December 2015, it was reported that 18 Asiatic cheetah cubs had recently been born at Pardisan Park.
In May 2022, an Asiatic cheetah gave birth to three male cubs in a facility in Iran; two died shortly after with Pirouz being the lone survivor. This is the first known reproduction of the subspecies in captivity. On 28 February 2023, Pirouz reportedly died in the veterinary hospital in Iran due to kidney failure. In August 2023, a young male Tara died from anemia caused by a leech infestation.

The Clue in the Crumbling Wall

The Clue in the Crumbling Wall is the twenty-second volume in the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series. It was first published in 1945 under Carolyn Keene, a pseudonym of the ghostwriter Mildred Wirt Benson.
Plot.
Nancy and her friends work to find an inheritance concealed in the walls of an old mansion before it can be discovered and stolen by an unscrupulous and crude man.
Covers.
The original art, by R. H. Tandy shows Nancy (in a shirtwaist dress), Bess and George removing a box that they have found while hiding from two men who were "hacking" away at the stone walls of a garden walkway. Bess is depicted with very dark blonde-light brown hair, and all three girls are in feminine clothing, contrary to what the text of the book describes (riding pants/slacks and casual blouses with sturdy boots/shoes). Nancy is depicted in the same dress in the frontispiece.
The cover was updated with revised art in 1962 to show the same scene, with all three girls again in dresses or skirts, and Nancy's hair changed to Titian red. In this cover, the men are on the other side of the wall. The frontispiece was not updated in this edition.
The story was revised for a 1973 edition with new art showing a montage of Heath Castle, the male vandals, and a perplexed and puzzled Nancy. The art work of the 1973 edition included a frontispiece and the internal illustrations that were described as crude and lacking in detail, according to adult critics and collectors.

Trevor Philips

Trevor Philips is a character and one of the three playable protagonists, alongside Michael de Santa and Franklin Clinton, of "Grand Theft Auto V", the seventh main title in the "Grand Theft Auto" series developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. He also appears in the game's multiplayer component, "Grand Theft Auto Online". A career criminal and former bank robber, Trevor leads his own organisation, Trevor Philips Enterprises, and comes into conflict with various rival gangs and criminal syndicates as he attempts to secure control of the drugs and weapons trade in the fictional Blaine County, San Andreas. He is portrayed by Canadian actor Steven Ogg, who provided the voice and motion capture for the character.
Rockstar based Trevor's appearance on Ogg's physical appearance, while his personality was inspired by the British criminal Charles Bronson. "Grand Theft Auto V" co-writer Dan Houser described Trevor as purely driven by desire and resentment. To make players care for the character, the designers gave the character more emotions. Trevor is shown to care about people very close to him, despite his antisocial behavior and psychotic derangement.
The general attention given to Trevor by critics was mostly very positive, although some reviewers felt that his violent personality and actions negatively affected the game's narrative. His design and personality have drawn comparisons to other influential video game and film characters. Many reviewers have called Trevor a likeable and believable character, and felt that he is one of the few protagonists in the "Grand Theft Auto" series that would willingly execute popular player actions, such as murder and violence.
Character design.
"Grand Theft Auto V" co-writer Dan Houser explained that Trevor "appeared to pretty much out of nowhere as the embodiment of another side of criminality [...] If Michael was meant to be the idea of some version of criminal control [...] what about the guy who didn't do that?" He later described Trevor as "the person who's driven purely by desire, resentment, no thought for tomorrow whatsoever, completely id rather than ego-driven." He stated that Trevor "kills without remorse, like a true psychopath, but very sentimental for the right reasons when it suits him."
Rockstar drew upon game protagonist archetypes while scripting the characters; Trevor was considered to embody insanity. Houser said the team characterised Michael and Trevor as juxtapositions of each other. He said, "Michael is like the criminal who wants to compartmentalise and be a good guy some of the time and Trevor is the maniac who isn't a hypocrite". He said that having three lead characters would help move the game's plot into more original territory than its predecessors, which traditionally followed a single protagonist rising through the ranks of a criminal underworld. Steven Ogg was cast as Trevor. During the initial audition process, Ogg noticed an on-set chemistry between him and Ned Luke (who portrayed Michael), which he felt helped secure them the roles. Ogg said, "When [Luke] and I went in the room together we immediately had something". While the actors knew their auditions were for Rockstar Games, it was when they signed contracts that they learned they would be involved in a "Grand Theft Auto" title.
Ogg felt Trevor's characterisation developed over time. He said, "Nuances and character traits that began to appearhis walk, his manner of speech, his reactions, definitely informed his development throughout the game". Ogg cites Tom Hardy's portrayal of English criminal Charles Bronson in the 2008 biopic "Bronson" as a strong stylistic influence. He opined that while Trevor embodies the violent, psychopathic "Grand Theft Auto" anti-hero archetype, he wanted to evoke player sympathy to Trevor's story. "To elicit other emotions was tough, and it was the biggest challenge and it's something that meant a lot to me", Ogg explained. The actors began working on the game in 2010. Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios. Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on-set, they considered their performances were no different from those of film or television roles. Their dialogue was scripted so that it did not allow the actors to ad-lib; however they sometimes made small changes to the performance with approval from the directors.
Appearances.
"Grand Theft Auto V".
Trevor was born in Canada, just north of the border of the United States. He grew up with a physically abusive father and an emotionally abusive mother. He loved planes, and at some point entered the military as a pilot, but was quickly forced to leave after being reproved in a psychological evaluation. Later on, Trevor committed crimes, the first one being a small robbery that landed him in jail for six months. Due to good behavior, he was out in four. He would continue his criminal ways, including using his piloting skills to become a smuggler. Trevor met Michael Townley in 1993 and they realised that they wanted to earn money by performing large heists, so they joined forces and became successful in doing so over the following years. Their partnership began to strain after Michael married a stripper named Amanda and started a family with her. Despite this, Trevor grew close to Michael's children, who came to see him as their uncle.
In 2004, during a heist in Ludendorff, North Yankton, Michael and mutual accomplice Brad Snider are shot by police while Trevor escapes. While on the run, Trevor is led to believe that Michael died and Brad was sent to jail. Trevor eventually settles in Sandy Shores, a small town in Blaine County, San Andreas, where he establishes a small criminal enterprise that smuggles weapons and manufactures methamphetamine, which he hopes will grow into a large empire. Due to raging abandonment issues, Trevor surrounds himself with two loyal friends that he kidnapped and brainwashed from their previous lives named "Nervous" Ron Jakowski and Wade Hebert. Trevor enters an uneasy truce with his competitors in Sandy Shores, including the Lost Motorcycle Club led by Johnny Klebitz, the Varrios Los Aztecas, and the O'Neil Brothers.
In 2013, Trevor finds out that Michael faked his death, and is so spooked and enraged that he breaks the truce and kills most of his competition in one outburst of violence, a deadly streak that continues when a potential game-changing deal with a group of triads falls through. He later drives to Los Santos, taking over the apartment and ruining the life of Wade's cousin Floyd, and reunites with Michael, who took on the surname "De Santa" and is supposedly living in witness protection. Though Michael is reluctant to have Trevor back in his life again, he eventually introduces him to Franklin Clinton, after which the two perform heists again, this time including Franklin. Trevor is determined to rob anything guarded by Merryweather Security Consulting, a private security firm that he dislikes, but he often fails.
When corrupt Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agents Dave Norton and Steve Haines contact Michael after he breaks his agreement with them by committing heists again, they force him to carry out a number of operations alongside Trevor and Franklin to undermine the rival International Affairs Agency (IAA). Steve later introduces the trio to Devin Weston, a billionaire investor who hires them to steal a number of rare cars, but ultimately cheats them out of their money. During this time, Trevor begins to bond with Franklin, as they carry out several jobs together without Michael, some of which involve Franklin's friend Lamar Davis, whom Trevor also befriends. Later, after not getting paid for a job, Trevor kidnaps Patricia, the wife of drug kingpin Martin Madrazo. Due to her kind maternal nature and his own abandonment issues, Trevor falls in love with her and only returns her to Madrazo after much demanding from Michael. However, the two stay in contact until the end of the game.
Eventually, Trevor begins to suspect that Brad is not in prison and that the Ludendorff heist from nine years prior was a setup, and flies to Ludendorff to confirm his suspicions. Upon finding Brad's body in the grave marked for Michael, he deduces that the latter had made a deal with Dave to help him fake his death and get rid of Trevor, but Brad was accidentally killed during the heist instead of Trevor. Feeling betrayed, Trevor vows to kill Michael, but later comes to his and Dave's aid when they are betrayed by Steve, because he needs Michael alive for one last heist. When that heist is successful, Trevor is so pleased that he lifts the death vow but still hates Michael.
Near the end of the game, Franklin is approached separately by Dave and Steve, who contend that Trevor is a liability and ask Franklin to kill him, and by Devin, who seeks revenge against Michael for an earlier incident. This leaves Franklin with three choices: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or try to save them both in a suicide mission.
"Grand Theft Auto Online".
Trevor is a main character in "Grand Theft Auto Online", the online multiplayer mode of "Grand Theft Auto V", set several months before the single-player story. He provides missions to the player after they reach Rank 13 and steal Trevor's rolling meth lab during a job. When the player arrives at his trailer, Trevor demands compensation for the stolen meth lab and has them complete several jobs, which generally consist of stealing drugs from rivals, mainly the Lost MC, and killing the dealers. Trevor later plays a major role in the 2015 "Heists" update, where he masterminds one of the heists featured in the update. This "heist" consists of the theft of drugs from various gangs, including the Lost, the O'Neil Brothers, the Los Santos Vagos, and the Ballas, which Trevor plans to sell for a large profit. After all drug shipments are collected, Trevor and the players deliver them to the deal's location, whereupon Trevor gives the players their cut in advance and they leave. When the buyer arrives, Trevor quickly realizes that the deal is a sting operation, at which point he is ambushed by the Drug Observation Agency (DOA), but manages to escape, albeit without the drugs.
Although Trevor makes no further appearances in the game, he is mentioned by Ron in the 2017 update "Smuggler's Run", which is set in that year, a few years after the single-player story. Ron, after being abandoned by Trevor, contacts the player to start their own smuggling operation, and when they meet, the former briefly talks about Trevor, saying he has "gone Vinewood" and has become a "guru" and "lifestyle coach"; this confirms Trevor is still alive after the events of "Grand Theft Auto V". Furthermore, the 2019 update, "The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort", includes a mention of the events of "The Third Way," implying that both Trevor and Michael canonically survive the events of the single-player story. Trevor is further referenced in the 2020 update, "The Cayo Perico Heist", which features a salacious picture of him and Patricia Madrazo, confirming the two did have an affair together; the 2021 update, "The Contract", in which he is mentioned as one of several people to visit Franklin at his new agency, "F. Clinton and Partner", which he runs with the help of the player character; and in the 2022 update, "Los Santos Drug Wars", when Ron informs the player that Trevor has left Sandy Shores and most of Trevor Philips Enterprises' assets have been abandoned.
Cultural impact.
Reception.
Trevor's character was met with generally positive feedback following the release of "Grand Theft Auto V". "Edge" singled out Trevor as the stand-out of the three protagonists, which they attributed to his volatile personality. Like "Edge", Caroline Petit of "GameSpot" considered Trevor "a truly horrible, terrifying, psychotic human being—and a terrific character." "Eurogamer"s Tom Bramwell, however, felt that Trevor undermined the other characters because he was a "shallow and unconvincing" sensationalised anti-hero, and that "his antics derail[ed] the narrative" and overshadowed the character development of Michael and Franklin. Xav de Matos of "Joystiq" found all three characters unlikable to the extent that they had an alienating effect on the story, noting that "though each character has a valid motivation for his journey, it's difficult to want them to succeed." He also felt that the ambivalence between Trevor and Michael was a tired device by the conclusion of the story as it became a "seemingly endless cycle" of conflict between them.
Lucas Sullivan of "GamesRadar" praised Trevor for being the first character in the series that "makes sense", stating that Trevor is one of the few protagonists in "Grand Theft Auto" that would willingly execute popular player actions, such as murder and violence. Andy Corrigan of "IGN" compared Trevor to Heath Ledger's Joker in the 2008 film "The Dark Knight". Corrigan felt that Trevor is the only character in "Grand Theft Auto V" not trying to fake his persona, stating "Trevor absolutely knows that he's a monster but just doesn't care. He enjoys causing misery and harm, lives for it and embraces it and – much like Heath Ledger's Joker – he exists purely for unadulterated anarchy". "Screen Rant"s Devin Ellis Friend criticised the character as "a step too far", deeming him unlikable and more suited to an antagonist role.
Trevor was named Best Character for the "Official Xbox Magazine" Game of the Year Awards 2013. The character was nominated for Character of the Year at VGX, Best New Character from "Hardcore Gamer", Best Character from "Destructoid", and Outstanding Achievement in Character at the 17th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards. Steven Ogg was also nominated for his work as Trevor from VGX, "The Telegraph", and the 10th British Academy Video Games Awards.
Controversies.
The mission "By the Book" from "Grand Theft Auto V" was criticised for its depiction of torture. In the mission, Trevor interrogates Ferdinand "Mr. K" Kerimov for information about Tahir Javan, a suspected Azerbaijani fugitive who poses a threat to the FIB (the game's version of the FBI). Trevor uses torture equipment on the restrained man, which players select from a table. Once Mr. K provides the FIB with the information, Trevor is asked to kill him, but instead drives him to the airport, providing him an opportunity to escape. While driving Kerimov, Trevor monologues about the ineffectiveness of torture, pointing out Kerimov's readiness to supply the FIB with the information without being tortured, and expressing that torture is used as a power play "to assert ourselves".
Reviewers echoed that while the mission served as political commentary on the use of torture by the United States government, its use of torture was in poor taste. "GameSpot"s Petit felt that placing the torture scene in context with the monologue created a hypocrisy in the mission's function as a commentary device, and "IGN"s Keza MacDonald felt it "pushed the boundaries of taste". In an editorial, Bramwell discussed whether the political commentary was overshadowed by the violent content, comparing the mission to ""s "No Russian" controversy. He considered the sequence lacking enough context to justify its violence and summarised its function as "flawed". Labour MP Keith Vaz expressed concern that underage players could be exposed to the mission. Keith Best of Freedom from Torture said the torturer role-play "crossed a line". Tom Chick defended the torture sequence, and wrote that unlike the "No Russian" mission or the 2012 film "Zero Dark Thirty", the underlying political commentary on torture in "By the Book" necessitated the violent content.

Nicolas Girard

Nicolas Girard (born June 5, 1972 in Montreal, Quebec) is a politician in Quebec, Canada, and former member of the National Assembly of Quebec. He was elected to the National Assembly in a by-election as a Parti Québécois member on September 20, 2004 in riding of Gouin in the Montreal region.
Student activism.
Girard was involved in politics in his teens, notably on the Parti Québécois (PQ) Youth Association in the riding of La Prairie.
As a student of Collège Édouard-Montpetit, Girard was involved in the Parti Québécois local cell. He was then elected president of the student college association. He fought against budget cuts made by the Canadian federal government.
During the 1995 Quebec referendum, he founded a student organization supporting the yes side. He gave several speeches along with PQ leader, Jacques Parizeau.
Girard has a bachelor's degree in political sciences at the Université de Montréal and did studies for the master's degree in industrial relations.
During his stay at the Université de Montréal, he was elected leader of student association - Fédération des associations étudiantes du campus de l'Université de Montréal (FAÉCUM).
He is a former student activist, notably organizing student rallies against former minister Lloyd Axworthy's cuts in education. He then became the president-elect of the Federation des associations étudiantes du campus de l'Université de Montréal (FAECUM). FAECUM supported the yes side during the 1995 Quebec referendum.
Early political career.
Upon graduation, Girard was hired by the Parti Québécois as a communication advisor. He later worked for several ministers, including François Legault, André Boisclair and Sylvain Simard as a press secretary.
At the 2003 provincial election, he was appointed as the deputy communication director for the campaign. Following the PQ's defeat, he was hired by the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), as a communication specialist. He also joined Pauline Marois's organization as an advisor, in her attempt to quickly replace Bernard Landry.
2004 by-election.
In 2004, following André Boisclair's resignation, he ran for the PQ in the Gouin riding. In the candidate selection process, he was backed by Pauline Marois and defeated high-profile Bloc Québécois vice-president, Dominique Ollivier, who was supported by Bernard Bigras, Gilles Duceppe and Louise Harel.
He won his selection at the third round by a one-vote margin.
Political career 2004 - 2007.
Early after his election, he left Marois' organization to back Bernard Landry who was gaining support in order to get a decent confidence score at a mandatory PQ internal vote.
In 2005, Bernard Landry resigned after gaining only 75% of his party support, Girard then convinced André Boisclair to make a bid for the PQ leadership, which he won.
Since, Girard's political career has been on the fast-track. Boisclair appointed him the PQ critics in social services and as the chief strategist for the upcoming provincial election. Girard then appointed long-time friend, Pierre-Luc Paquette, as PQ's general manager.
It is said that Girard would play a leading role in an eventual Boisclair government.
General election 2007.
Girard was re-appointed the PQ's candidate in the Gouin riding in 2007. He faced Françoise David, the leader of Quebec Solidaire, a left wing political party.
His electoral office was occupied by FRAPRU, a social lobby supporting more public funded housing, police were forced to evacuate the illegal protesters.
He was re-elected with almost 40% of the vote, however the PQ finished in third position.
Defeat and AMT appointment.
Girard was defeated in the September 4, 2012 Quebec general election. On September 25, 2012, he was appointed president and CEO of the Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT), which coordinates regional transportation in the Montreal area.
He was removed from the position by Premier Philippe Couillard in August 2015, resulting in PQ claims that it was because he was a sovereignist. His large severance pay also created controversy.

Douglas Allanbrook

Douglas Allanbrook (April 1, 1921 – January 29, 2003) was an American composer, concert pianist and harpsichordist. He was associated with a group of mid-twentieth century Boston composers who were students of Nadia Boulanger. His compositions are described by the Kennedy Center as "smooth, showing astute sense, assertiveness, and originality."
Early life.
Allanbrook was born on April 1, 1921, in Melrose, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. He had one sister, Jean. He began taking piano lessons at the age of eight. Within two years he was playing Bach, Haydn, and Czerny. By thirteen, he started composing; his first serious piece was entitled "On the Death of a Beautiful White Cat". While in high school, he was composing sonatas for violin and piano and writing sketches for a Symphony in G minor.
Education.
After high school, Allanbrook studied at Boston University for one year. In 1939 he was hired as a music teacher at the Mary Wheeler finishing school, a private girls' school, in Providence, where Gloria Vanderbilt was among his piano students. In 1941, the Rhode Island Symphony played his student orchestral work "Music for a Tragedy."
During the same year, Nadia Boulanger came to Providence to accept an honorary degree from Brown University. She heard some of Allanbrook's music and immediately took him under her wing. He began commuting regularly to Cambridge to study with her, and became part of her coterie of Boston composers, which included Harold Shapero, Irving Fine, Paul Des Marais, and Daniel Pinkham. She eventually persuaded him to quit his teaching job to study full-time, for free, with her.
In the fall of 1942, the Army drafted Allanbrook. Serving as an infantryman for three years, he fought his way up the Italian peninsula, in the process earning a Bronze Star and starting his lifelong love affair with Italy. His 1995 book, "See Naples: A Memoir of Love, Peace, and War in Italy", recounts his wartime experiences with the 88th Division in the Italian Campaign, in which his division suffered a 75% casualty rate.
When the war ended, he returned to Boston to enter Harvard University on the G.I. Bill. His major professor was composer Walter Piston, with whom he studied harmony, counterpoint, and orchestration. Among his fellow students were Peter Davison, who was to become a poet and publisher, and John Clinton Hunt, also to become a writer. Allanbrook composed prolifically, including his first three-movement piano sonata, and a cantata to T.S. Eliot's poem "Ash Wednesday". He spent his summers at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, composing among distinguished artists also there.
He completed his B.A. degree in May 1948 and was awarded a Paine Traveling Fellowship from Harvard, which he used to spend the next two years (1948–1950) in Paris honing his composing and performing skills, once again studying under Nadia Boulanger. There, he formed close musical friendships with composers Ned Rorem, Noël Lee, Leo Preger and Georges Auric.
In the summer of 1950 on a Fulbright scholarship, he returned to Italy to study harpsichord at Conservatorio San Pietro a Majella under Ruggero Gerlin, a longtime associate of Wanda Landowska, Under Gerlin's tutelage, he learned to perform the partitas and the two books of the "Well-Tempered Clavier" of J. S. Bach, the "Ordres" of François Couperin, and various sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti. Allanbrook spent two extraordinarily creative years in Italy as composer and performer. His main work from this period is his first opera, "Ethan Frome," a setting of Edith Wharton's novel of the same name with a libretto by John Clinton Hunt.
St. John's.
In 1952 he returned to the U.S. to become a tutor at St. John's College in Annapolis in its Great Brooks Program. Although he taught part-time at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore from 1953 through 1956, he chose to stay at St. John's for the duration of his teaching career. Allanbrook was on the faculty at St. John's for 45 years, teaching music, math, philosophy, Greek, and French.
In 1982, he was awarded an American Academy of Arts and Letters music prize. He retired from the college in May 1986, he continued to teach and perform there until his death. For many years, he was a member of the board at the Yaddo artists colony near Saratoga Springs, NY. He died in Annapolis, Maryland on January 29, 2003, from a heart attack at the age of 81.
Catalog.
His catalog contains 63 mature musical compositions, from his Te Deum (1942) to his String Quartet No. 6 (2002). He greatly admired Boulanger and Stravinsky, and his formative years of composing show influence from both artists. His main works include seven symphonies, two operas, "Ethan Frome" and "Nightmare Abbey" (based on the novel by Thomas Love Peacock), sacred and secular choral works, four string quartets, numerous chamber pieces, and innumerable piano and harpsichord works. His opera "Ethan Frome" was written in 1951 was based on the novel by Edith Wharton. 
He performed the piano part himself in 1955 for Aaron Copland at the Harvard Club. However, the opera was shelved for fifty years until his son John Allanbrook directed in at the Eliot House. During his lifetime, his orchestral works were performed by orchestras across America and Europe, including the National Symphony Orchestra, Baltimore Symphony, Stuttgart Philharmonic, Munich Radio Orchestra. He had a warm and creative collaboration with the Annapolis Brass Quintet from 1975 until its disbandment in 1991. Other performers who gave premieres of his music under his supervision include harpsichordist Ralph Kirkpatrick, violinist Robert Gerle, and the Kronos Quartet. 
Personal life.
Allanbrook was married twice, with both marriages ending in divorce. As recounted in "See Naples", his first marriage was in 1952 to Candida Curcio, a theater actress whom he met in Italy; they had a son, Timothy, an architect. Later in 1975, he married the Mozart scholar and future president of the American Musicological Society Wye Allanbrook née Jamison (March 15, 1943 – July 15, 2010); their son, John, is a musician who has conducted recordings of several major Allanbrook works for Mapleshade Records.

The Mystery of the Tolling Bell

The Mystery of the Tolling Bell is the twenty-third volume in the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series. It was first published in 1946 under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. The actual author was ghostwriter Mildred Wirt Benson.
Plot summary.
Nancy, Bess, and George travel to the picturesque seaside town of Candleton to meet Carson Drew's client, a woman named Mrs. Chantrey, who has been cheated out of money by buying phony stock. On the way, they stop in Fisher's Cove where Bess buys expensive "Mon Coeur" perfume from a suspicious woman. Upon arrival in Candleton, they meet busy Mrs. Chantrey at her restaurant, the Salsandee shop, and help out as waitresses for a day. While waiting on tables, Nancy meets a mysterious diner named Amos Hendrick. He tells her of his search for a missing Paul Revere bell. When he leaves, Nancy finds a piece of paper that he dropped with a mysterious message on it and gives it to Mrs. Chantrey for safekeeping.
When Mr. Drew fails to join the girls as planned, Nancy is worried. She soon finds that he has been kidnapped and left in a hotel. She rescues her father, who thinks that he has been drugged. Meanwhile, Nancy also becomes interested in the local story of Amy Maguire, who married a man named Ferdinand Slocum despite her parents' disapproval.
While talking with Mrs. Chantrey and the other residents of Candleton, they tell her of a cave which is said to be inhabited by a ghost who rings a bell every time water rushes through it. Nancy investigates and is swept into the sea by rushing water until she is rescued. This does not stop her and she continues to investigate the cave, which lies directly under the Maguire house. Then, Nancy discovers that many other residents of Candleton besides Mrs. Chantrey have been scammed into buying fake stock in the "Mon Coeur" brand. Nancy eventually tracks down the perfume scammers, finds out the true story of Amy Maguire, uncovers the ghost, and, with the help of the mysterious piece of paper, rescues the tolling bell, which turns out to be the valuable Paul Revere bell that Amos Hendrick was searching for.
Artwork, text, and publishing history.
The first edition featured a dust jacket and plain-paper frontispiece by Russell H. Tandy, and it was the first Nancy Drew book with a wraparound spine. The book is also notable as it was the last Nancy Drew book to be published with the orange silhouette and orange lettering on the book boards that had been in print since 1932.
The Tandy art was kept in print for multiple original text picture cover printings from 1962 until 1966, when Rudy Nappi revised the cover art depicting the same scene for later original text printings, with a revised frontispiece by an unknown artist. This artwork featured Nancy in pink and was in print until the book was revised in 1973.
The cover and spines of books with the second cover art (first Nappi) both have the title "Mystery of the Tolling Bell". This would create confusion as the original title was "The Mystery of the Tolling Bell", and the original text still said "The Mystery of the Tolling Bell" on the inside.
It was not until the text was revised in 1973 that the title was changed to "Mystery of the Tolling Bell". Rudy Nappi made a new cover for the revision using heavy symbolism from the original two covers. The revision had five internal illustrations and a frontispiece by an uncredited artist, although one of the illustrations bears the clear signature "A. Orbaan" (presumably Albert Orbaan). The revised text of this book is still in print as of 2021, now published in “glossy flashlight” format by Grosset &amp; Dunlap.
The original text was in print for 26 years, from 1946 to 1972. A revised text was published in 1973 as part of the Stratemeyer Syndicate’s project to revise the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys texts published from 1927 to 1956. The original spans 25 chapters and 213 pages, while the revised edition has 20 chapters and 181 pages.

Uzushio-class submarine

The "Uzushio"-class submarine was a series of seven submarines in service with Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force during the Cold War between 1972 and the mid-1990s. They were the first generation of the teardrop type submarine that valued the underwater performance against that of the preceding conventional-hull type . Many were converted to training submarines (ATSS) towards the end of their lives.
General characteristics.
The "Uzushio" class was the first Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force submarine design to incorporate the teardrop hull. The "Uzushio"s had a double hull construction which used NS-63 high-tensile steel to allow for a deeper diving depth of . The submarines measured long between perpendiculars and at the beam. They had a maximum draught of and had a standard displacement of and a displacement when submerged.
The submarines were powered by a diesel-electric system composed of two Kawasaki-MAN V8V24/30AMTL diesel engines and two electric motors turning one shaft creating surfaced and submerged. This gave the boats a maximum speed of surfaced and dived. The submarines incorporated a separate emergency blowing system to all the vessels to surface rapidly and had a 3D automatic steering system which combined automatic depth and automatic direction maintenance systems.
The "Uzushio"s were armed with Japanese Type 89 torpedoes fired from six torpedo tubes located amidships. The submarines had their sonar array located in the bow which was composed of a ZPS-4 surface search sonar, a ZQQ-2, ZQQ-3, or ZQQ-4 passive/active search sonar suite and a SQS-36J or SQS-4 active sonar.

History of Dundee

Dundee () is the fourth-largest city in Scotland with a population of around 150,000 people. It is situated on the north bank of the Firth of Tay on the east coast of the Central Lowlands of Scotland. The Dundee area has been settled since the Mesolithic with evidence of Pictish habitation beginning in the Iron Age. During the Medieval Era the city became a prominent trading port and was the site of many battles. Throughout the Industrial Revolution, the local jute industry caused the city to grow rapidly. In this period, Dundee also gained prominence due to its marmalade industry and its journalism, giving Dundee its epithet as the city of "jute, jam and journalism".
Toponymy.
The name "Dundee" is of uncertain etymology. It incorporates the place-name element "dùn", fort, present in both Gaelic and in Brythonic languages such as Pictish. The remainder of the name is less obvious. One possibility is that it comes from the Gaelic 'Dèagh', meaning 'fire'. Another is that it derives from 'Tay', and it is in this form, 'Duntay' that the town is seen in Timothy Pont's map (c.1583–1596). Another suggestion is that it is a personal name, referring to an otherwise unknown local ruler named 'Daigh' or 'Deaghach'.
Folk etymology, repeated by Hector Boece in 1527, claims that the town's name was originally Allectum, and it was renamed "Dei Donum" 'Gift from God', following David, 8th Earl of Huntingdon's arrival there on his return from the Holy Land. The city was referred to by some Gaelic speakers, particularly in Highland Perthshire and Braemar as "An Athaileag".
Early history.
Dundee and its surrounding area have been continuously occupied since the Mesolithic. A kitchen midden of that date was unearthed during work on the harbour in 1879, and yielded flints, charcoal and a stone axe.
A Neolithic cursus, with associated barrows has been identified at the north-western end of the city and nearby lies the Balgarthno Stone Circle. A lack of stratigraphy around the stone circle has left it difficult to determine a precise age, but it is thought to date from around the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age. The circle has been subject to vandalism in the past and has recently been fenced off to protect it. Bronze Age finds are fairly abundant in Dundee and the surrounding area, particularly in the form of short cist burials.
From the Iron Age, perhaps the most prominent remains are of the Law Hill Fort, although domestic remains are also well represented. Near to Dundee can be found the well-characterised souterrains at Carlungie and Ardestie, which date from around the 2nd century AD. Several brochs are also found in the area, including the ruins at Laws Hill near Monifieth, at Craighill and at Hurly Hawkin, near Liff, Angus.
Early Middle Ages.
The early medieval history of the town relies heavily on tradition. In Pictish times, the part of Dundee that was later expanded into the Burghal town in the twelfth/13th centuries was a minor settlement in the kingdom of Circinn, later known as Angus. An area roughly equivalent to the current urban area of Dundee is likely to have formed a demesne, centred on Dundee castle.
Hector Boece records the ancient name of the settlement as "Alectum" in his 1527 work "Historia Gentis Scotorum" (History of the Scottish People). While there is evidence this name was being used to refer to the town in the 18th century, its early attribution should be treated with caution as Boece's reliability as a source is questionable.
The Chronicle of Huntingdon (c1290) records a battle on 20 July 834 AD between the Scots, led by Alpin (father of Kenneth MacAlpin), and the Picts, which supposedly took place at the former village of Pitalpin (NO 370 329). The battle was allegedly a decisive victory for the Picts, and Alpin is said to have been executed by beheading. This account, while perhaps appealing, should be treated with caution as the battle's historical authenticity is in doubt.
High Middle Ages.
Tradition names Dundee as the location of a court palace of the House of Dunkeld. However, no physical trace of such a residence remains and it is likely to be mythical. The origin of this myth is likely to have been a misinterpretation of the ancient name of Edinburgh, "Dunedin".
Dundee's history as a major town dates to the charter in which King William granted the earldom of Dundee to his younger brother, David (later Earl of Huntingdon) in 1179–1182. Earl David is thought to have built Dundee Castle, which formerly occupied the site now occupied by St Pauls Cathedral.
Dundee's position on the Tay, with its natural harbour between St Nicholas Craig and Stannergate (now obscured by development) made it an ideal location for a trading port, which led to a period of major growth in the town as Earl David promoted the town as a burgh.
On David's death in 1219, the burgh passed first to his son, John. John died without issue in 1237 and the burgh was divided evenly between his three sisters, with the castle becoming the property of the eldest, Margaret and, subsequently, to her youngest daughter, Dervorguilla. Dervorguilla's portion of the burgh later passed to her eldest surviving son, John Balliol, and the town became a Royal Burgh on the coronation of John as king in 1292.
Dundee experienced periods of occupation and destruction in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Following John Balliol's renunciation (1295) of Edward I's claimed authority over Scotland, the English King twice visited Scotland with hostile intent. Edward (the 'Hammer of the Scots') revoked Dundee's royal charter, removing the town's people the right to control local government and the judiciary. He occupied the Castle at Dundee at the outbreak of the First War of Independence in 1296 but the castle retaken by siege by the forces of William Wallace in 1297, immediately prior to the Battle of Stirling Bridge.
From 1303 to 1312 the city was again occupied. Edward's removal resulted in the complete destruction of the Castle by Robert the Bruce, who had been proclaimed King of Scots at nearby Scone in 1306. In 1327, the Bruce granted the royal burgh a new charter. Later in the 14th century, during the conflict between England and France known as the Hundred Years' War, the French invoked the Auld Alliance, drawing Scotland into the hostilities. Richard II subsequently marched northward and razed Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee.
Early modern era.
 Dundee became a walled city in 1545 during a period of English hostilities known as the rough wooing (Henry VIII's attempt to extend his Protestant ambitions north by marrying his youngest son Edward, Duke of Cornwall to Mary, Queen of Scots). The Wishart Arch was believed to be the only remaining part of the wall though a piece behind St Paul's Cathedral may have survived, though this remains unconfirmed pursuant to further investigation. Mary maintained the alliance with the French, who captured Protestant opponents, including John Knox, at St Andrews Castle, in nearby east Fife in July 1547. That year, following victory at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, the English occupied Edinburgh and went on to destroy much of Dundee by naval bombardment. The Howff Burial Ground, granted to the people of Dundee in 1546, was a gift from Mary. In July 1547, much of the city was destroyed by an English naval bombardment.
During a period of relative peace between Scotland and England, the status of Dundee as a royal burgh was reconfirmed (in The Great Charter of Charles I, dated 14 September 1641). In 1645, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Dundee was again besieged, this time by the Royalist Marquess of Montrose. In 1648 Dundee was badly hit by the plague.
On 1 September 1651, during the Third Civil War, the city was attacked by Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentarian forces, led by George Monk. Much of the city was destroyed and an estimated 2000 inhabitants were killed or taken prisoner. (See Siege of Dundee.) Up to 200 Dundee ships were sunk and/or confiscated. In the aftermath, a large contingent of English soldiers remained in the town and married local women, causing a permanent impact on the composition of the population.
Dundee was later the site of an early Jacobite uprising when John Graham of Claverhouse, 1st Viscount Dundee raised the Stuart standard on Dundee Law in 1689. This show of support of James VII (James II of England) following his overthrow, earned the Viscount the nickname Bonnie Dundee.
Troubles and financial collapses in the 1760s caused the background of the Tayside Meal Mobs on 1772 and 1773 which began in Dundee in the summer of 1772.
Modern era.
Dundee greatly expanded in size during the Industrial Revolution mainly because of the burgeoning British Empire trade, flax and then latterly the jute industry. By the end of the 19th century, a majority of the city's workers were employed in its many jute mills and in related industries. Dundee's location on a major estuary allowed for the easy importation of jute from the Indian subcontinent as well as whale oil—needed for the processing of the jute—from the city's large whaling industry. A substantial coastal marine trade also developed, with inshore shipping working between the city of Dundee and the port of London. The industry began to decline in the 20th century as it became cheaper to process the cloth on the Indian subcontinent. The city's last jute mill closed in the 1970s.
In addition to jute the city is also known for jam and journalism. The "jam" association refers to marmalade, which was purportedly invented in the city by Janet Keiller in 1797 (although in reality, recipes for marmalade have been found dating back to the 16th century). Keiller's marmalade became a famous brand because of its mass production and its worldwide export. The industry was never a major employer compared with the jute trade. Marmalade has since become the "preserve" of larger businesses, but jars of Keiller's marmalade are still widely available. "Journalism" refers to the publishing firm DC Thomson &amp; Co., which was founded in the city in 1905 and remains the largest employer after the health and leisure industries. The firm publishes a variety of newspapers, children's comics and magazines, including "The Sunday Post", "The Courier", "Shout" and children's publications, "The Beano" and "The Dandy".
In the nineteenth century Dundee was home to various investment trusts, including the Dundee Investment Company, the Dundee Mortgage and Trust, the Oregon and Washington Trust and the Oregon and Washington Savings Bank, Limited. These merged in 1888 to form the Alliance Trust. Many of the investors in this trust were notable local figures including land gentry, such as the Earl of Airlie, merchants, ship owners, ship builders and jute barons and other textile manufacturers. The Alliance Trust shared its headquarters with another Dundee based trust the Western &amp; Hawaiian Investment Company, later known as the Second Alliance Trust. The two would finally merge into one firm in 2006. The two Alliance Trusts' original main interests were focused on mortgages and land business principally in agricultural areas of the western United States (notably Oregon, Idaho and Texas) and Hawaii. The company also leased mineral rights of properties in Texas and Oklahoma, as well as investing in various ventures in Britain and abroad. In 2008 the company was listed on the FTSE 100 Index and the next year moved to new purpose-built headquarters.
Dundee also developed a major maritime and shipbuilding industry in the 19th century. 2,000 ships were built in Dundee between 1871 and 1881, including the Antarctic research ship used by Robert Falcon Scott, the "RRS Discovery". This ship is now on display at Discovery Point in the city, and the Victorian steel-framed works in which Discovery's engine was built is now home to the city's largest book shop. The need of the local jute industry for whale oil also supported a large whaling industry. Dundee Island in the Antarctic takes its name from the Dundee whaling expedition, which discovered it in 1892. Whaling ceased in 1912 and shipbuilding ceased in 1981. The last connection with whaling in Dundee reportedly ended in 1922 when a trading ketch owned by Robert Kinnes &amp; Sons, which had been first set up as a trading company for the Tay Whale Fishing Company, was lost in the Cumberland Sound. 
The Tay estuary was the location of the first Tay rail bridge, built by Thomas Bouch and completed in 1877. At the time it was the longest railway bridge in the world. The bridge fell down in a storm less than a year later under the weight of a train full of passengers in what is known as the Tay Bridge disaster. None of the passengers survived.
Dundee became the first city in Scotland to gain official city status, after Queen Victoria signed a patent announcing the transition of Dundee from a royal burgh into a city. Dundee would officially gain city status on 26 January 1889. The patent still exists and is kept in storage in the city archives.
Tomlinson et al. argue that Dundee enjoyed a "Golden Age" in the 1950s and 1960s. The collapse of the jute industry, they argue, was well handled for three reasons. First, the jute industry was protected from cheap imports by the state. Tariffs and quotas were not allowed by the GATT agreements. Instead protection came through the continuation from 1945 into the 1970s of the wartime Jute Control system, by which the Ministry of Materials imported jute goods and sold them at an artificial price related to the cost of manufacture in Dundee. Secondly, the jute firms agreed to company consolidation to make themselves more efficient, to increase labour productivity, and to cooperate in developing new fibres and goods. Third, labour unions and management ended the hard feelings that caused so much labour unrest and had come to a head in the dismal decade of unemployment in the 1930s. In the postwar cooperation, employers, unions and the city spoke with one voice. Success in managing jute's decline, and the brief brief of multinational corporations like NCR and Timex, held off decline and there was relative full employment in the city down to the 1970s. The golden age ended in the 1980s as the multinationals found cheaper labour in Bangladesh, India, and South America, and the Thatcher government ended state support for British industry. By the 1990s jute had disappeared from Dundee.
The Timex Corporation was a major employer in the city in the post-war era, but in the early 1980s financial difficulties led to attempts to streamline its operations in Dundee. This led to industrial action and after a major strike in 1993 the company completely withdrew from Dundee.
Industrial revolution.
After the Union with England ended military hostilities, Dundee was able to redevelop its harbour and established itself as an industrial and trading centre. Dundee's industrial heritage is traditionally summarised as "the three Js": jute, jam and journalism. East-central Scotland became too heavily dependent on linens, hemp, and jute. Despite Indian competition and the cyclical nature of the trade which periodically ruined weaker companies, profits held up well in the 19th century. Typical firms were family affairs, even after the introduction of limited liability in the 1890s. The profits, either taken from the firms or left on interest, helped make the city an important source of overseas investment, especially in North America. The profits were seldom invested locally, apart from the linen trade, because low wages limited local consumption, and because there were no important natural resources, the region offered little opportunity for profitable industrial diversification.
Linen.
Linen formed the basis for the growth of the textile industry in Dundee. During the 18th and 19th Centuries, flax was imported from the countries surrounding the Baltic Sea for the production of linen. The trade supported 36 spinning mills by 1835, but various conflicts, including the Crimean War, put a stop to the trade. Textiles thus formed an important part of the economy long before the introduction of jute, but it was jute for rope-making and rough fabrics that helped put Dundee on the map of world trade. Dundee's first flax mills, at Guthrie Street and Chapelshade, appeared in 1793. The industry suffered a slump in the early 19th century, but recovered after a few years, and the years 1821 and 1822 saw 12 mills built in Dundee and Lochee.
The Dundee firm Baxter Brothers, which owned and operated the large Dens Works complex, was the world's largest linen manufacturer from around 1840 until 1890. The firm began in 1822 when William Baxter, who had previously operated a mill at Glamis, and his son Edward built a mill on the Dens Burn. In 1825 Edward left the company and two younger brothers joined as partners, the firm being renamed Baxter Brothers and Co. The company became part of the Low and Bonar Group, jute merchants and manufacturers, in 1924. Baxter Brothers traded as an entity within Low and Bonar until 1978. The Baxters also had a long term interest in the Claverhouse Bleachfield located slightly to the north of Dundee, and now within the city's boundaries. The bleachfield, used for boiling and bleaching linen and yarn was in use from the eighteenth century. From 1814 it was operated by Turnbull &amp; Co, a company which members of the Baxter family were involved in and which evolved into Boase &amp; Co. In 1892 Baxter Brothers owned 55% of the shares in Boase &amp; Co. and eventually assumed complete ownership of the firm in 1921. Baxter Brothers' extensive archives, including highly detailed plans of Dens Works, are now held by Archive Services, University of Dundee. The Baxter family's money was crucial to establishing University College Dundee, now the University of Dundee and the Dundee Technical Institute, now the University of Abertay. University College's co-founder and principal benefactor was William Baxter's daughter, Mary Ann Baxter. Edward Baxter's grandson Sir George Washington Baxter, was later president of the college. William's son Sir David Baxter left the bequest which would later be used to found the Technical Institute.
Another major linen works was Stobswell Works in Dura Street which was built in the 1860s. It was originally owned by Laing and Sandeman and later Laing Brothers, before becoming the base of the Buist Spinning Company in 1900. The Buist Spinning Company eventually went into voluntary liquidation in 1979, a year after it had become a subsidiary company of Tay Textiles.
Jute.
Jute is a rough fibre from India used to make sacking, burlap, twine and canvass. By the 1830s, it was discovered that treatment with whale oil, a byproduct of Dundee's whaling industry, made the spinning of the jute fibre possible, which led to the development of a substantial jute industry in the city which created jobs for rural migrants. The industry was also notable for employing a high proportion of women. In 1901 25,000 women were employed in the jute industry, with women accounting for more than 70% of the industry's workers in Dundee. By 1911 the percentage of persons employed in Dundee's jute industry who were women had risen to 75%. Dundee's jute industry was also notable in that a relatively high number of those employed in it were married women, which was unusual for the time. In 1911 a total of 31,500 were employed in the jute industry in Dundee, which accounted for 40.4% of all of the city's workers.
The first jute related patent in Dundee was granted in 1852 to David Thomson. Thomson had been an apprentice to the jute pioneer James Neish and had founded his textile business in 1848. This later evolved into Thomson, Shepherd &amp; Co. Ltd, whose Seafield Works in Taylor's Lane operated until 1986.
Several large industrial complexes grew up in the city in the nineteenth century to house the jute industry, including Camperdown Works in Lochee which was the world's largest jute works. It was owned by Cox Brothers, whose family had been involved in the linen trade in Lochee since the early eighteenth century, and was constructed from 1850 onwards. By 1878 it had its own railway branch and employed 4,500 workers, a total which had risen to 5,000 by 1900. Like several of Dundee's jute manufacturers, Cox Brothers became a part of Jute Industries Ltd, which was formed by the amalgamation of several Dundee jute firms in 1920. J Ernest Cox, the grandson of one of the founders of the firm, became chairman of Jute Industries in 1920 and would hold this position until 1948. Camperdown works closed in 1981. Caldrum Works, built 1872–1873, and operated by Harry Walker &amp; Sons, was Dundee's (and Britain's) second largest jute mill by the 1920s. In 1913 the works covered 8 acres of ground. Like Cox Brothers, Harry Walker of sons became a part of Jute Industries in 1920.
Another firm which became part of jute industries in 1920 was J. &amp; A. D. Grimond Ltd, founded in 1840 and who owned Maxwelltown Works and the Bowbridge works in the Hilltown area. Jute Industries also included Gilroy Sons &amp; Co Ltd, which was founded by three brothers in 1849. Gilroys was among the first companies in Dundee to directly import jute from India and its products included sacks, hessians and canvas. Jute Industries became Sidlaw Industries Ltd in 1971. Low &amp; Bonar Ltd, who opened the Eagle Jute Mills in the city in 1930, and who had acquired Baxter Brothers in 1924, also were a major jute firm, expanding their interests in this area with the 1953 acquisition of Henry Boase &amp; Co.
Another major textile presence in Dundee was Don Brothers, Buist &amp; Co. This was formed in the 1860s when the Forfar firm of William and John Don &amp; Co and A J Buist, the owners of Ward Mills in Dundee. In 1867 the firm built the New Mill in Dundee's Lindsay Street. In the 1960s Don Brothers, Buist and Co merged with the textile merchants Low Brothers &amp; Co (Dundee) Ltd to form Don and Low, a group which eventually owned or operated several other textile firms. Low Brothers had themselves earlier taken control of Alexander Henderson &amp; Son Ltd a Dundee jute spinning firm that had been founded in 1833 and based at South Dudhope Works.
Caird (Dundee) Ltd traced their origins back to 1832 when Edward Caird began to manufacture cloth in 12-loom shed at Ashton Works. Caird was a pioneer in Dundee in the weaving of cloth composed of jute warp and weft. In 1870 his son James Key Caird, later noted as philanthropist, took over the business. He greatly expanded it, rebuilding and extending Ashton Works and acquiring Craigie Works. Cairds at one time employed 2,000 hands and its mills were described by the Dundee Advertiser in 1916 as being 'a model of comfort for the workers'. William Halley and Sons Ltd was also founded in 1832 and operated Wallace Craigie Works. The boom in the price of jute caused by the American Civil War saw the works double in size and by 1946 it had 3,312 spindles and 130 looms. In 1857 Hugh &amp; Alexander Scott founded H. &amp; A. Scott, Manufacturers which was based at Tayfield Works, Seafield Road. This firm, which eventually moved into polypropylene manufacture as well as jute and other textiles, survived until 1985 when it was taken over by Amoco UK Ltd.
By the end of the 19th century the majority of Dundee's working population were employed in jute manufacture, but the industry began to decline in 1914, when it became cheaper to rely on imports of the finished product from India. (Dundee's 'jute barons' had invested heavily in Indian factories). By 1951 only 18.5% of Dundee's workforce was employed in the jute industry, with the total number of female workers employed in the industry declining by 62%. In 1942, the Ashton Works were requisitioned by the Government and taken over by "Briggs Motor Bodies Ltd" for the production of jerrycans. Ten million were produced by the time of derequisition in 1946. The Cragie works closed for economic reasons at the end of 1954 when a study found that it was not viable to modernised equipment; production was subsequently moved to Ashton works. Commercial jute production in Dundee ceased in the 1970s, particularly after the cessation of jute control on 30 April 1969. Some manufacturers successfully diversified to produce synthetic fibres and linoleum for a short time. The last of the jute spinners closed in 1999. From a peak of over 130 mills, many have since been demolished, although around sixty have been redeveloped for residential or other commercial use.
The Association of Jute Spinners and Manufacturers was founded in Dundee in 1918. Its initial aim was to act as a cartel to help the prices of its members' products. However, it soon evolved into a significant employers' organisation. It also concerned itself with all national and local legislation which impacted upon the jute industry and aimed to foster good relations between workers and employers. Initially the Association had 56 members in the Dundee and Tayport area alone, but by 1982 there were only 8 spinners or manufacturers of jute left in the United Kingdom.
An award-winning museum, based in the old Verdant Works, commemorates the city's manufacturing heritage and operates a small jute-processing facility. Archive Services at the University of Dundee hold a wide range of collections relating to the textile industry in Dundee, including the records of many of the major jute works.
Jam.
Dundee's association with jam stems from Janet Keiller's 1797 'invention' of marmalade. Mrs. Keiller allegedly devised the recipe in order to make use of a cargo-load of bitter Seville oranges acquired from a Spanish ship by her husband. This account is most likely apocryphal, as recipes for marmalade have been found dating back to the 16th century, with the Keillers likely to have developed their marmalade by modifying an existing recipe for quince marmalade. Nevertheless, marmalade became a famed Dundee export after Alex Keiller, James' son, industrialised the production process during the 19th century.
The Keillers originally started selling their produce from a small sweet shop in the Seagate area of the city which specialised in selling locally preserved fruit and jams. In 1845, Alex Keiller moved the business from the Seagate and into a new larger premises on Castle Street. Later, he also later bought premises in Guernsey to take advantage of the lack of sugar duties. The Guernsey premises accounted for a third of the firm's output but still carried the Dundee logo. The Guernsey plant was closed in 1879 due to lack of profitability and was moved to North Woolwich where it was brought back under the control of the Dundee branch. Though iconic to the city, jam was never a major sector of the city's industry, employing approximately 300 people at its peak compared to the thousands who worked in the Jute industry at the same time. Today traditional marmalade production has become the preserve of larger businesses, but distinctive white jars of Keiller's marmalade can still be bought. For many years, these were made by the Maling pottery of Newcastle upon Tyne.
Journalism.
Journalism in Dundee generally refers to the publishing company of D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd. Founded in 1905 by David Coupar Thomson and still owned and managed by the Thomson family, the firm publishes a variety of newspapers, children's comics and magazines, including "The Sunday Post", "The Courier", "Shout" and children's publications, "The Beano" and "The Dandy". Journalism is the only "J" still existing in the city and, with the company's headquarters on Albert Square and extensive premises at Kingsway East, D.C. Thomson remains one of the city's largest employers after local government and the health service, employing nearly 2000 people.
Maritime industry.
As Dundee is located on a major estuary, it developed a maritime industry both as a whaling port (since 1753) and in shipbuilding. In 1857, the whaling ship "Tay" was the first in the world to be fitted with steam engines. By 1872 Dundee had become the premier whaling port of the British Isles, partly due to the local jute industry's demand for whale oil for use in the processing of its cloth. Over 2,000 ships were built in the city between 1871 and 1881. The last whaling ship to be built at Dundee was in 1884. The whaling industry ended around 1912. The last connection between Dundee and the whaling industry ended in 1922 with the loss of the trading ketch, 'Easonian', which was owned by the Dundee-based shipping agents and charter company Robert Kinnes &amp; Sons. Kinnes &amp; Sons had been formed in 1883 by the managing director of the Tay Whale Fishing Company.
In December 1883, a whale was caught in the Tay and was later publicly dissected by Professor John Struthers of the University of Aberdeen. The incident was popular with the public and extra rail journeys were organised to assist those from surrounding areas who wished to see the whale. The creature became known as the Tay Whale, and the event was also celebrated in a poem by William McGonagall.
The Dundee Perth and London Shipping Company (DPLC) ran steamships down the Tay from Perth and on to Hull and London. The firm still exists, but is now a travel agency. However, shipbuilding shrank with the closure of the five berths at the former Caledon Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company in 1981, and came to an end altogether in 1987 when the Kestrel Marine yard was closed with the loss of 750 jobs.
, the ship taken to the Antarctic by Robert Falcon Scott and the last wooden three-masted ship to be built in the British Isles, was built in Dundee in 1901. It returned to Dundee in April 1986 initially being moored in Victoria Dock. Since 1992 Discovery has been moored next to a purpose-built visitors' centre, Discovery Point. The oldest wooden British warship still afloat, , is moored in Victoria Dock, although it was not built in Dundee. Dundee was also the home port of the Antarctic Dundee whaling expedition of 1892 which discovered Dundee Island, named after the expedition's home port. The steamship , best known for its reported inaction during the sinking of RMS "Titanic" was built in Dundee.
Harbour and wharfs.
A coastal city with a major maritime industry, Dundee's harbour has long been of importance. As early as 1447 King James II of Scotland granted letters patent to Dundee's Council granting them the right to collect dues on goods coming in via the port. In 1770 the harbour was remodelled by John Smeaton, who introduced water tunnels to tackle the perennial problems caused by the vast quantities of silt washed down the Tay which formed sandbanks in the harbour, thus blocking it. In 1815 a Harbour Act was passed which moved control of the harbour from the Town Council to a Board of Harbour Commissioners. Under their guidance the harbour was greatly expanded from the 1820s with the addition of King William IV Dock, Earl Grey Dock, Victoria Dock and Camperdown Dock. In 1844 a triumphal arch made of timber was erected at the entrance of the harbour to mark the arrival, by sea, of Queen Victoria on her way to her first holiday in Aberdeenshire. In 1849 a competition was held to design a replacement permanent structure. The competition was won by a design submitted by James Thomas Rochead. The resulting Royal Arch quickly became one of Dundee's most iconic symbols. King William IV Dock and the Early Grey Dock were filled in by the 1960s during the construction of the Tay Road Bridge and its approach roads, with the Royal Arch being demolished at the same time. The Arch is the subject of a famous photograph by the photojournalist Michael Peto.
Dundee still has several wharfs. The most prominent wharfs are King George V, Caledon West, Princess Alexandra, Eastern and Caledon East. The Victoria Dock was built in the 19th century to serve the loading of major imports of jute. Activity ceased in the 1960s and the wharf was out of service for forty years. It has since been redeveloped into a shopping wharf known as "City Quay". The Quay has a 500-yard Millennium Bridge spanning its eastern quay which swings round to allow ships in. Camperdown docklands is also being redeveloped in a manner similar to Canary Wharf in London and is scheduled for completion in 2008. The last wharf to be built in Dundee was at Stannergate for the shipbuilders Kestrel Marine. It was formally opened by Charles, Prince of Wales on 17 July 1979 and named after him.
Tay Bridge Disaster.
In 1878 a new railway bridge over the Tay was opened, connecting the rail network at Dundee to Fife and Edinburgh. Its completion was commemorated in verse by William McGonagall. About two years after completion, the bridge collapsed under the weight of a full train of passengers during a fierce storm. All on board the train were lost and some bodies were never recovered. McGonagall's "The Tay Bridge Disaster" recounts the tragedy in verse. perhaps one of his best known poems. The public inquiry of the Tay Bridge disaster in 1880 found that the bridge had been "badly designed, badly built and badly maintained" and Sir Thomas Bouch was blamed for the catastrophe. He had under-designed the structure and used brittle cast iron for critical components, especially the lugs which held tensioned tie bars in the towers. It was these lugs which fractured first and destabilised the towers in the high girders section. The bolt holes in the lugs were cast, and had a conical section, so all the load was concentrated at a sharp outer edge. Such conical bolt holes were used for critical horizontal strut lugs as well, and weakened the structure substantially. The towers of the high girder section were heavily loaded and were very top heavy, making then susceptible to toppling. The towers failed during the storm as the train was travelling over, and a chain reaction followed as each of the towers in the high girders section collapsed. In 1887 the bridge was replaced by William Henry Barlow with a much more substantial bridge, which was at that time the longest railway bridge in Europe, at just over long (Europe's longest bridge today is the Oresund Bridge).
Public transport.
Trams.
The first municipal public transport in Dundee was operated by Dundee and District Tramways. From 1877, these were generally horse-drawn, but by June 1885 steam cars with green and white livery were introduced. Unusually, the tram lines were publicly built and owned, although initially leased by police commissionaires to private companies.
All routes came under direct municipal control in 1893, which allowed the city to adopt overhead electric lines to power the trams. Between 1899 and 1902 the tramways were fully electrified. The first electric tram in Dundee started on 12 July 1900. The route ran from High Street to Ninewells in the West "via" Nethergate and Perth Road with a later route running to Dryburgh in the North. The peak of the tram network was in 1932, when 79 lines operated in the city. By 1951, many of the trams had not been updated. At least a third of the stock was over 50 years old. A study led by the Belfast transport consultant, Colonel R McCreary showed that the cost of trams compared with bus service was 26.700 and 21.204 pence per mile, respectively. He advocated abandoning the tramway system in 1952. In October 1956, the last trams were quietly taken out of service. On the evening of 20 October 1956 the last tram (#25) went to Maryfield Depot. Over 5,000 people witnessed the tram leaving the depot at 12:31 am to go to the Lochee depot. All remaining cars were reduced to scrap by burning.
After the closure of the system two of the tram cars were offered for preservation. One was one of a batch of 10 trams that had been built by Brush in 1930. The other was one of two single-deck works cars which were numbered RW1 and RW2. They had originally been part of a batch of six trams built by Brush and delivered to Dundee in 1907. In 1935 these two had been cut down and converted into repair wagons. Ultimately, as no suitable storage sites could be found, they were not saved for preservation, but scrapped along with the remaining fleet.
Buses.
The first trolleybuses in Scotland were introduced along Clepington Road in Dundee during 1912–1914. However, motor buses were gradually introduced from 1921 to supplement the tram system, and double-decker buses appeared ten years later. Electric-powered operated by "Dundee Corporation Electricity Works" were still used in parts of the city until 1961. In 1975, Dundee Corporation Transport became part of the new Tayside Regional Council. Tayside adopted a new dark blue, white and light blue livery for its buses, replacing the former dark green. The Volvo B55 double deck bus became standard in the Tayside fleet during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1986, following deregulation, Tayside Buses was formed as a separate company. It was later privatised and bought out by National Express and now trades as Xplore Dundee under the ownership of McGill's Bus Services.
Dundee (and the surrounding countryside) was also served by buses of Walter Alexander (part of the state-owned Scottish Bus Group), which was rebranded as Northern Scottish in the early 1960s. In the 1980s the Tayside operation of Northern Scottish became a separate company, Strathtay Scottish. The company was privatised in 1991, being sold to Yorkshire Traction which became being part of the Stagecoach Group in 2005.
Rail.
Rail transport in Dundee began with the Dundee and Newtyle Railway Company which was formed in 1826 and was the first railway to be built in the North of Scotland. The railway linking Dundee with Newtyle opened in 1832 and was eventually part of the Caledonian Railway. This was followed by the Dundee and Arbroath Railway Company which was incorporated in May 1836. The line linking Dundee and Arbroath opened in October 1838 from a temporary terminus near Craigie, was fully operational by 1840. A route to the west materialised with the founding of the Dundee and Perth Railway Company in 1845. It opened its line two years later, although it was not connected to Perth Station until 1849. The company also leased the Newtyle line from 1846 and the Arbroath line from 1848.
By the end of the late 1870s, Dundee had three main stations, Dundee (Tay Bridge), serving the North British Railway and its connections, Dundee West, the Caledonian Railway station for Perth and Glasgow, which was rebuilt in a grand style in 1889–1890, and the smaller Dundee East on the Dundee and Arbroath Joint Railway. Various plans were put forward to concentrate all Dundee's railway facilities in a new central station. This idea was first mooted in 1864 by John Leng, then the editor of the "Dundee Advertiser", and the idea re-emerged in 1872 following the start of work on the Tay Rail Bridge. The concept was also put forward for a final time in 1896. Various sites for a central station were put forward including building it between the High Street and the harbour, between the Murraygate and the Meadows and on a waterfront site created by partially filling in two of Dundee's docks. However, none of these proposals was ever realised, and the three distinct stations survived as independent entities.
Dundee formerly had commuter train services linking Dundee (Tay Bridge) station with Wormit and Newport-on-Tay. These ceased following the opening of the Tay Road Bridge. Other commuter train services to Invergowrie, Balmossie, Broughty Ferry and Monifieth have been substantially reduced since the 1980s. Dundee East closed in 1959 and Dundee West station closed in May 1965, with all traffic being diverted to Tay Bridge station (now simply known as Dundee station). The West station was demolished in 1966 at a cost of £1,150.
Tay Ferry.
A passenger and vehicle ferry service across the River Tay operated from Craigie Pier, Dundee, to Newport-on-Tay. Popularly known in Dundee as "the Fifie", the service was withdrawn in August 1966, being replaced by the newly opened Tay Road Bridge.
Three vessels latterly operated the service – the paddle steamer "B. L. Nairn" (of 1929) and the two more modern ferries "Abercraig" and "Scotscraig", which were both equipped with Voith Schneider Propellers.
Hospitals.
The original Town Hospital in Dundee was founded in what is now the Nethergate in 1530 to provide for the support of the sick and elderly persons dwelling in the burgh and run by the Trinitarians. After the Reformation its running was taken over by the town council and it was used to house and care for a dozen 'decayed burgesses'. The original building was replaced in about 1678. During the 18th century it was decided it was better to care for the needy in their own homes and the hospital was then used for other purposes. Tay Street was built on its extensive gardens, and St Andrews Cathedral was later erected on the site of the hospital itself.
In 1798 an infirmary was opened in King Street which would serve as the principal hospital in Dundee for almost 200 years. This hospital was granted a Royal Charter by George III in 1819, after which it became known as the "Dundee Royal Infirmary and Asylum". In 1820 the asylum was formally established as a separate entity in its own premises in Albert Street, and the hospital in King Street became Dundee Royal Infirmary (commonly known as DRI). The infirmary moved to larger premises in Barrack Road in 1855. The asylum received a Royal Charter from Queen Victoria in 1875 and became known as Dundee Royal Lunatic Asylum. In 1879 work began on a new site for the asylum at Westgreen Farm, Liff to which all patients had been transferred by October 1882. A second building, Gowrie House was erected to the south of Westgreen for private patients. From 1903 Westgreen was owned and operated by the Dundee District Lunacy Board as Dundee District Asylum, while Gowrie House continued as Dundee Royal Lunatic Asylum. The two were recombined in 1959 as Dundee Royal Mental Hospital and later became known as Royal Dundee Liff Hospital.
During an outbreak of cholera in 1832, a building in Lower Union Street was converted into an isolation hospital, but was refitted for use as lodgings after the epidemic was over. Other temporary isolation facilities were used later in the century, but in 1889 King's Cross Hospital was opened in Clepington Road as Dundee's first permanent fever hospital. By 1913 it had expanded its facilities from two wards to seven. It was run by the town council until the creation of the National Health Service. From 1929 the town council also ran Maryfield Hospital, Stobswell, which had formerly been the East Poorhouse Hospital. The hospital eventually took over the entire site of the East Poorhouse and served as Dundee's second main hospital after DRI.
Slightly to the north of Dundee was Baldovan Institution founded in 1852 as 'an orphanage, hospital and place of education and training for 'imbecile' children'. Its foundation was largely thanks to the benevolence of Sir John and Lady Jane Ogilvy. The asylum and the orphanage were later separated, with the former evolving into Strathmartine Hospital (that name being adopted in 1959). Strathmartine was progressively decommissioned from the late 1980s, closing completely in 2003. In 2014 Heritage Lottery Funding was award to a project to for former residents and staff at Strathmartine Hospital to record their stories of the hospital. The project is led by the Thera Trust and involves the University of Dundee, the dundee Local History Group, Advocating Together and the Living Memory Association.
In 1899 the Victoria Hospital for Incurables was set up in Jedbrugh Road to provide long term nursing care for the terminally ill. This would later become Royal Victoria Hospital. In 1959 it gained a geriatric ward and is now mainly used for patients over the age of 65, and is also home to the Centre for Brain Injury Rehabilitation. In 1980 the remaining patients at the Sidlaw Hospital, a former sanitorium that was latterly used as a convalescent home and to provide respite care, were transferred to the Royal Victoria.
A hospital for women, known as Dundee Women's Hospital and Nursing Home, was opened in 1897. Originally in Seafield Road, it aimed to provide surgical care for women at a low price. This hospital moved to Elliott Road and eventually closed in the 1970s.
A hospital for dental treatment, Dundee Dental Hospital, opened in 1914 in Park Place. During the First World War the hospital provided dental services to regular and territorial soldiers. In 1916 the hospital was extended to include a dental school. It became part of the NHS in 1948, and new premises in Park Place opened in 1968. The Dental School is part of the University of Dundee. In the 1980s closure of the Dental School was proposed by the University Grants Committee. This was strongly resisted and a successful campaign led by the university resulted in its retention.
After World War II it soon became apparent that Dundee's existing hospital facilities were insufficient. They also provided inadequate teaching facilities for the medical students at what was to become the University of Dundee. A new hospital was planned, and after several delays was opened at Ninewells in 1974. The opening of Ninewells Hospital led to the closure of Maryfield to patients in 1976, although some of its buildings were retained for use for administration purposes. Dundee Royal Infirmary's functions were also gradually transferred to Ninewells and it closed in 1998. In the 1990s and 2000s many of King’s Cross Hospital’s functions were also moved to Ninewells, but it still retains a number of outpatient departments and also serves as the headquarters of NHS Tayside.
Coat of arms.
The city’s coat of arms is a pot of 3 silver lilies on a blue shield supported by two green dragons. Above the shield is a single lily and above that a scroll with the motto "Dei Donum", gift of God.
The blue colour of the shield is said to represent the cloak of the Virgin Mary while the silver (white) lilies are also closely associated with her. There is an early carving in the city’s Old Steeple, showing a similar coat of arms with Mary, protecting her child with a shield from dragons. Following an Act of Parliament passed in 1672, Dundee’s 'new' coat of arms was matriculated in the office of the Lord Lyon King of Arms on 30 July 1673. However, by this time Scotland had become a Presbyterian nation, and any such idolatry of the Virgin Mary would have been frowned upon, leading to the more subtle symbolism that appears today. There are different theories as to why Dragons came to be used as supporters. One is that on the earlier arms they represent the violent sea that the Virgin Mary protected David from. Another is that they relate to the local legend of the Strathmartine Dragon.
Over the years small changes crept in until in 1932 the city council decided to ask the Lord Lyon King of Arms about the correct form. Amongst other differences he pointed out that the dragons on the coat of arms were actually wyverns. (Although closely related wyverns have only two legs while dragons have four.) The coat of arms above the Eastern Cemetery gateway shows wyverns instead of dragons and three lilies above the shield instead of one. It was decided to go back to the original form with dragon supporters and one lily and to add a second motto 'Prudentia et Candore' – Wisdom and Truth.
The coat of arms was slightly modified in 1975 when the City of Dundee District Council was created under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. A coronet, with thistle heads, was incorporated; this emblem being common to the coats of arms of all Scottish district councils. A further modification took place in 1996, when the District Council was replaced by the current Dundee City Council; the design of the coronet was revised to the present format.
Important People Associated with Dundee.
Winston Churchill.
Between 1908 and 1922, one of the city's Members of Parliament was Winston Churchill, at that time a member of the (Coalition) Liberal Party. He had won the seat at a by-election on 8 May 1908 and was initially popular, especially as he was the President of the Board of Trade and, later, senior Cabinet minister. However, his frequent absence from Dundee on cabinet business, combined with the local bitterness and disillusionment that was caused by the Great War strained this relationship. In the buildup to the 1922 general election, even the local newspapers contained vitriolic rhetoric with regards to his political status in the city. At a one meeting he was only able to speak for 40 minutes when he was barracked by a section of the audience. Prevented from campaigning in the final days of his reelection campaign by appendicitis, his wife Clementine was even spat on for wearing pearls. Churchill was ousted by the Scottish Prohibitionist Edwin Scrymgeour – Scrymgeour's sixth election attempt – and indeed came only fourth in the poll. Churchill would later write that he left Dundee "short of an appendix, seat and party". In 1943 he was offered Freedom of the City – by 16 votes to 15 – but refused to accept. On being asked by the council to expand on his reasons, he simply wrote: "I have nothing to add to the reply which has already been sent".
Archives.
Many of Dundee's historical records are kept by two local archives, Dundee City Archives, operated by Dundee City Council, and the University of Dundee's Archive Services. Dundee City Archives holds the official records of the burgh along with those of the former Tayside Region. The archive also holds the records of various people groups and organizations connected to Dundee. The university's Archive Services hold a wide range of material relating to the university and its predecessor institutions and to individuals associated with the university such as D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson. Archive Services is also home to the archives of several individuals, businesses and organizations based in Dundee and the surrounding area. The records held at the university include a substantial number of business archives relating to the jute and linen industry in Dundee, records of other businesses including the archives of the Alliance Trust and the department store G.

Sick Puppies

Sick Puppies are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1997. After releasing their debut album "Welcome to the Real World" in 2001, the band rose to prominence in 2006 when their song "All the Same" was uploaded, along with a video, to YouTube. The video supported the Free Hugs Campaign, which was launched in Sydney by Juan Mann, and has since received over 78 million views on the website. This success was followed up with their second studio album, "Dressed Up as Life", in 2007, which entered the "Billboard" 200 at number 181. Their third studio album, "Tri-Polar", came out in 2009. The band's fourth studio album, "Connect", was released in 2013. They released their fifth studio album, "Fury", in 2016 with new vocalist Bryan Scott after Shimon Moore was fired from the band in October 2014.
History.
Early career (1997–1999).
The band was formed by singer/lead guitarist Shimon Moore and bassist Emma Anzai in the music room of Mosman High School in 1997, when they double-booked the room and bickered over who would get to practice. They soon bonded over their love of Silverchair. Initially with Shimon on drums and Emma on guitars, the duo would frequently meet up to play Green Day, Rage Against the Machine, and Silverchair songs, and eventually felt compelled to write their own material. When Chris Mileski joined the band to play drums, Emma switched to bass and Shimon to guitar and vocals, and they became Sick Puppies.
There are two stories as to how the band name originated. The official version is that Shimon Moore thought of the name himself when the band members were brainstorming, and then came home a few days later to find his father Phil reading the book "Sick Puppy" by Carl Hiaasen. The alternate version is that a neighbour's dog entered the garage during a rehearsal and vomited on their equipment. An early fan made the comment, "That's one sick puppy", and the name stuck.
Emma Anzai took up a job as a telemarketer and Shimon took a job holding a sandwich board in the Pitt Street Mall in Sydney. Through their own financing and with help from Shimon's father (a musician and producer), the band released their debut EP "Dog's Breakfast".
Initial success (2000–2008).
The band entered the Triple J Unearthed band competition in 2000 with a demo of their song, "Nothing Really Matters", and went on to co-win the Sydney-region along with Blue and Ariels.Spans.Earth., which led to a management deal with Paul Stepanek Management. This deal enabled the band to release their debut studio album, "Welcome to the Real World" in 2001, and their second EP, Fly in 2003. The band decided they needed a fresh start when the record label they had signed a contract with folded and their drummer Chris Mileski left the band. They decided to move to Los Angeles when rock photographer Robert Knight, who would later co-star in a documentary called Rock Prophecies with the band, said to their manager, "You should move the band over here, I really think they will do well". As they were without a drummer, the band posted an ad on Craigslist, where they found their current drummer Mark Goodwin.
In 2007, Sick Puppies released their second album, "Dressed Up As Life". The album came after the huge success of the "Free Hugs Campaign", and featured their breakout single "All the Same". The song reached number eight on the U.S. Modern Rock chart and is also featured in the video for the Free Hugs Campaign, which won YouTube video of the year in 2006. They followed up the single with "My World", which peaked at No. 20. The band also released "Pitiful" and "What Are You Looking For" as singles in 2008.
"Tri-Polar" and related releases (2009–2012).
Sick Puppies went into the recording studio in December 2008 to write, record, and produce their next studio album, which was released on 14 July 2009. They also wrote a song for Capcom's video game Street Fighter IV called "War", and it has been used in the advertisements and promotion for the game. It also reached the top 40 on the iTunes top rock songs. "War" was used during the Washington Capitals 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs introduction video. The song was also included as the first track on "Tri-Polar". Their first single off "Tri-Polar", "You're Going Down", reached No. 1, and was used as the theme song for the WWE pay per view Extreme Rules in June 2009. It was also used in "SmackDown vs. Raw 2010", the "My Soul to Take" (2010) movie trailer, and in the trailer and opening credits of "Tekken". The second single from the album, "Odd One", hit radio on 10 November.
Sick Puppies released a new song called "That Time of Year" on "NCIS: The Official TV Soundtrack – Vol. 2" and through their MySpace page for the holidays. The third single from the album, "Maybe", hit radio stations on 22 June. "Maybe" peaked at No. 1 on Billboard Heatseekers, No. 15 on Rock, and No. 6 on Alternative. It is the first Sick Puppies song to be on the Hot 100 chart, making it the band's most successful song. The album's fourth single, "Riptide", was released in February 2011, and peaked at number 6 on the Billboards Rock Chart. "Tri-Polar" was released in the UK on 4 April 2011.
On 14 August 2009, Sick Puppies made their film debut in "Rock Prophecies", a documentary about the career of acclaimed music photographer Robert Knight. This award-winning film features his life as he started out filming music greats such as Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix, and his current mission to find today's up-and-coming bands and help them become tomorrow's top rock acts. This includes him convincing Sick Puppies to leave their homes to pursue success in the American music industry in Los Angeles.
According to bassist Emma Anzai, "() was like, 'Hey I want to put you in my film', so we were like, 'All right, cool.' So now it's two years later and he documented when we did the first album, the first show, all that kind of stuff. It was really cool. He wanted a new band to . . . develop." During the process, the band was filmed for a few days at a time, and said that they would forget the cameras were there and act accordingly, so this film captures them and their true interactions out of the spotlight. It was partly due to their involvement in this project and Mr. Knight's endorsement that they were able to acquire their first American record deal with RMR/Virgin/EMI. This record deal then led to the first U.S album, "Dressed Up as Life". "Rock Prophecies" was nationally aired on PBS and became available on DVD on 14 September 2010.
On 7 April 2010, Sick Puppies released an acoustic EP titled "Live &amp; Unplugged", featuring three tracks from their "Tri-Polar" album and one B-Side from that album. The versions of "Odd One", "So What I Lied", and "The Pretender" were recorded in a studio, while "You're Going Down" was recorded live in a Chicago radio station during an interview. To promote the EP, Sick Puppies offered a merchandise package that included "Tri-Polar" and "Live &amp; Unplugged" with a limited edition lithograph; this package was sold at their concerts. On 1 March 2011, Sick Puppies released their all-acoustic seven-track EP "Polar Opposite", which includes acoustic versions of "Riptide", "Don't Walk Away", and more. It was recorded in studio, along with string ensemble accompaniment. Anzai also contributes more major lead vocals on the record.
Shimon Moore's departure, "Fury", and "Wave the Bull" (2013–present).
Sick Puppies released the follow-up album to "Tri-Polar" on 16 July 2013. The band originally stated on UStream that the working title was "Under the Black Sky" and that there would be a song by the same title. They later confirmed that the album name had changed, and officially announced the title of the album to be "Connect", and its lead single, "There's No Going Back" was released on 20 May 2013. The second single off the album, "Gunfight", was released on 13 October 2013. Connect was released in Europe on 31 March 2014. The album's third single, "Die to Save You", was released on 29 April 2014. The album's fourth single, "Connect", was released on 19 July 2014. In October 2014, American musician Blue Stahli announced that Anzai had worked on the track "Not Over 'Til We Say So" for his upcoming album "The Devil".
On 20 October 2014, it was announced that frontman Shimon Moore had left the band and that the remaining two members would continue on without him. This left bassist Emma Anzai as the only original member remaining in the band. The remaining members of Sick Puppies released a statement alleging that Moore was fired after he attempted to dissolve the band through a lawyer. Moore stated he was kicked out while out of town and he had no knowledge of it beforehand. He said he was sad and that he wished the band well.
On 15 December 2015, the band teased their upcoming music. They also signed on to play tours including Rock on the Range. On 8 February 2016, they revealed their new vocalist, Bryan Scott, who previously performed with Glass Intrepid and Dev Electric and briefly toured as a vocalist for Emphatic in 2011, while previewing a new single called "Stick to Your Guns". On 31 March 2016, Sick Puppies released their single "Stick to Your Guns". The album "Fury" was released in May 2016.
In May 2022, Anzai joined Evanescence as the band's full-time bassist while also remaining with Sick Puppies.
Sick Puppies released the song "There Goes the Neighborhood" on 26 July 2024 as the first single from their sixth album, "Wave the Bull". The album was released in 28 March 2025.

The Banquet (2006 film)

The Banquet (Chinese: 夜宴), released on DVD in the United States as Legend of the Black Scorpion, is a 2006 "wuxia" drama film. A Chinese-Hong Kong co-production, the film was directed by Feng Xiaogang and stars Zhang Ziyi, Ge You, Daniel Wu and Zhou Xun. It is a loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy "Hamlet" set in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in 10th century China. 
Plot.
At the end of the Tang dynasty, China is divided. The Crown Prince, Wu Luan, is deeply in love with the noblewoman Little Wan. However, his father, the Emperor, decides to marry her. Wu Luan, deeply hurt, flees to a remote theater to study music and dance. Meanwhile, the Emperor is murdered by his brother, Li, who takes the throne. He also dispatches riders to assassinate Wu Luan, who survives the attack. Returning to court, Wu Luan is met by Empress Wan and her lady-in-waiting Qing Nu who is officially still engaged to him.
The tension in the Imperial Court is high, and when a palace official greets Empress Wan as 'Empress Dowager', he and his family are sentenced to a violent death. With his death, Minister Yin's son, General Yin Sun, is sent to fill the position in a distant province, greatly weakening Yin Taichang's position in the court. Wu Luan is asked by the Emperor to perform a brief swordplay ceremony, to practice for the Empress' upcoming coronation. While practicing, the Imperial Guard suddenly produce sharpened swords and attempt to kill Wu Luan and make it look like an accident. The ceremony is stopped by the Empress. Later in his chambers, a scroll is mysteriously delivered to Wu Luan, depicting his father being murdered by his uncle. Wu Luan enquires at an apothecary, who reveals that the poison used for the murder is made from Arsenic trioxide and black scorpions. Nothing on earth is more deadly except for "the human heart".
Meanwhile, the Empress Wan is to have a new coronation ceremony. As a special treat, Wu Luan is required to perform a swordplay ceremony. Instead, as an accomplished singer and dancer, Wu Luan stages a masked mime play that exposes his uncle as his father's murderer. The Emperor is notably shaken, but manages to conjure a plan to remove Wu Luan. Rather than kill the prince and risk alienating Empress Wan, he decides Wu Luan would be traded as a hostage for the prince of a neighbouring kingdom, the Khitans, although it is known that the neighbour prince is an imposter. An ambush by the emperor's men is set up the snowy border with the Khitans' kingdom in the north, but Yin Taichang's son Yin Sun, following the Empress's command, saves the prince.
Believing that his nephew is dead, and power is firmly in his grip, the Emperor calls for a grand banquet. The Empress comments that it would be bad luck to organise such an auspicious occasion on their 100th day of knowing each other, but the Emperor claims he does not surrender to superstitions. The Empress then decides to poison him, with a poison made from Arsenic trioxide and black scorpions. All goes according to plan until Qing Nu takes to the stage, claiming to have planned another performance for the occasion, and in tribute to her fiancé, she wears her theatre mask. The scheme to poison the emperor fails as the cup he was to drink out of is instead given to Qing Nu out of respect and partly of pity for her. During the dance, Qing Nu falls down dead on stage, and Wu Luan reveals himself to comfort her in her dying moments. The Emperor realises in horror that the Empress had plotted his death. After a confrontation with Wu Luan, the Emperor commits suicide by drinking the rest of the poisoned wine. The Empress proclaims Wu Luan the new Emperor. However, Yin Sun, enraged by his sister's death, attempts to kill the Empress to avenge his sister. His blade is stopped by the hand of Wu Luan. However, the knife is poisoned. The Empress stabs him through the neck, killing him instantly, while Wu Luan lays dying. Empress Wan is proclaimed Empress Regnant by the Lord Chamberlain.
Empress Wan speaks of the "flames of desire" that she has satiated by taking the throne. While celebrating, she is suddenly pierced by a flying blade. As she is dying, she turns around to face her assailant. Her confusion shifts to horror and anguish, as she is quickly murdered. At the end, the audience remains unsure of who the mysterious assailant was.
Production.
Actress Shao Xiaoshan said she substituted for Zhang Ziyi in some bathing and sex scenes. However, she is not listed in the credits. "I don't care whether my name is on the credits but I just want to tell the public that I did the nude scenes," Shao said on her blog. At Cannes film festival, Zhang Ziyi told the media that she did not appear nude in the movie, indirectly confirming that she had a stand-in for the nude scenes.
Reception.
On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 36% score based on 11 critics, with an average rating of 4.48/10.
Wally Hammond of "Time Out" gave the film 4/5 stars but found it "too drawn-out, lacking the originality and sprightliness those such as Zhang Yimou and Ang Lee brought to similar fare." "PopMatters" rated the film 9/10 and said it "has everything you could want out of a tragic, wuxia epic."
Festivals and awards.
"The Banquet" had its international premiere at the Venice Film Festival, where it received the Future Film Festival Digital Award. Parts of the film had been previewed by film buyers during the 2006 Cannes Film Festival in May, where a promotional event for the film was hosted.
The film was screened at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival on the same day it opened to wide release in China. It received the People's Choice Award at the 4th World Film Festival of Bangkok, where it was screened two weeks before its wide release in Thailand.
"The Banquet" was chosen as Hong Kong's entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, while China's entry was Zhang Yimou's "Curse of the Golden Flower".
The Banquet won two awards out of five nominations at the 43rd Golden Horse Awards in Taiwan. Art Director Tim Yip won for both Best Art Direction and Best Make up and Costume Design. The 3 other nominations were Best Cinematography (Li Zhang), Best Original Score (Dun Tan), and Best Song (Jane Zhang). Co-star Xun Zhou, who plays Qing Nu, (Best Actress) and Stunt Choreographer Jyun Woping (Best Stunt Choreography) won awards for other films.

Mecsek

Mecsek (; ; Serbian: "Meček" or Мечек; ) is a mountain range in southern Hungary. It is situated in the Baranya region, in the north of the city of Pécs.
Etymology.
The Hungarian toponym "Mecsek" derives from the sobriquet version of the name Mihály (Michael). Originally applied only to the hills adjacent to Pécs, the name Mecsek was first mentioned in 16th century.
Geography.
The mountains cover an area of approximately 500 km2. The highest peak in the mountain range is Zengő (literally translates to 'resonant'), which has an elevation of 682 metres (2,238 feet). The Mecsek Hills consist of plateau-like block mountains of a broken, folded structure. Its basis is crystalline rock of Variscan origin surmounted by Triassic and Jurassic limestone and dolomite and Tertiary formations that form the main block. The mountains are divided by a structural fault running NW to SE. The eastern part consists mainly of high ridges of sedimentary rock. The west has extensive limestone plateaux and areas dominated by sandstones of the Permian-Triassic period. There are important karst phenomena to be found on the limestone plateaux. Mecsek is rich in minerals (including uranium) compared to other territories of Hungary. The climate is mixed and represents elements of the mediterranean and continental climate. The territory is home to 20-30 plant species which are unknown in other parts of the Carpathian Basin.
Political and cultural history.
Due to their relative small size and medium height, the hills of Mecsek were always politically and economically connected with the neighboring lowlands of Baranya and Tolna, serving primarily as a source of wood. The forested hills also offered substantial protection against the possible enemies.
The first significant political centre of the region was formed on the top of Jakab-hegy during the Iron Age which was later captured and developed into an oppidum by the Celts in the 2nd century BC. After the Roman conquest of Pannonia the settlement's population, like in the similar cases of Bibracte or Entremont was probably forced to move to the southern slopes of the Mecsek, where Sopianae, the predecessor of Pécs emerged.
Throughout the Hungarian Middle Ages the valleys of the Mecsek became more densely populated, providing raw materials for the thriving episcopal city of Pécs. The castles of Szászvár, Márévár and Kantavár were built in the era as residencies of nobles or the Church. The Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit partially stemmed from the hermit communities of the Mecsek, whom the Bishop of Pécs founded a monastery at Jakab-hegy in 1225. The significant Pécsvárad Abbey also controlled substantial areas in the region.
Due to the Ottoman occupation of Hungary and the following wars, raids and over-taxation the population growth stagnated, however the everyday and religious life of the locals didn't change much. The region was protected by its remoteness. After the Treaty of Karlowitz, the local nobles invited German settlers to the region. The territories east of Mecsek became a part of the German ethnic island commonly referred to as Swabian Turkey.
Significant amounts of black coal were discovered in the 19th century, the strategic resource greatly advanced the industrialization of the region. Mines were opened in Pécs, Szászvár and Komló which were all subsequently connected to the Hungarian economy with railways. In the aftermath of World War I and the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes occupied the region, but the Treaty of Trianon eventually left the area in the possession of Hungary.
A huge part of the German-speaking population of the area was expelled from Hungary after World War II, although many German communities lingered. The socialist Hungary further developed the coal mines of Pécs and Komló. Uranium was also discovered and mined near Kővágószőlős from the 1950s. The Mecsek Hills were the scene of pitched battles during the Hungarian Revolution in November 1956 between Hungarian units dubbed "the Mecsek Invisibles" and the invading Soviet forces.
After the fall of communism in Hungary, the economically unsustainable mines were closed. The Mecsek now serves mostly as a recreational area with moderate forestry activities.
Parts.
Mecsek is divided to two parts:

Anthony Casso

Anthony Salvatore Casso (May 21, 1942 – December 15, 2020), nicknamed "Gaspipe", was an American mobster and underboss of the Lucchese crime family. During his career in organized crime, he was regarded as a "homicidal maniac" in the Italian-American Mafia. Casso is suspected of having committed dozens of murders, and had confessed to involvement in between 15 and 36 murders. 
Government witness Anthony Accetturo, the former caporegime of The Jersey Crew, once said of Casso, "all he wanted to do is kill, kill, get what you can, even if you didn't earn it". In interviews, and on the witness stand, Casso confessed involvement in the murders of Frank DeCicco, Roy DeMeo, and Vladimir Reznikov. Casso also admitted to several attempts to murder Gambino family boss John Gotti.
Following his arrest in 1993, Casso became one of the highest-ranking members of the Mafia to turn informant. After taking a plea agreement, he was placed in the witness protection program. In 1998, it was rescinded and Casso was dropped from the program after several infractions. Later that year, a federal judge sentenced him to 455 years in prison for racketeering, extortion, and murder.
Casso died in prison custody from complications related to COVID-19 on December 15, 2020.
Early life.
Casso was born on May 21, 1942, in South Brooklyn, in New York City, the youngest of the three children to Michael and Margaret Casso, née Cucceullo. Casso's grandparents had immigrated to the United States from Campania, Italy in the 1890s. His godfather was Salvatore Callinbrano, a made man and "caporegime" in the Genovese crime family, which maintained a powerful influence on the Brooklyn docks. Casso dropped out of school at 16 and got a job with his father as a longshoreman. In his youth, he became a crack shot, firing pistols at targets on a rooftop which he and his friends used as a shooting range. Casso also made money shooting predatory hawks for pigeon keepers.
Personal life.
Casso married fellow South Brooklyn native Lillian Delduca on May 4, 1968. They had a daughter and son.
Prior to his marriage to Lillian, Casso had a serious relationship with fellow South Brooklyn native Rosemarie Billotti, whose parents hoped he would marry. Without Lillian's knowledge, for decades after their wedding, Casso secretly kept Billotti as his mistress and set her up in a house in Mount Olive, New Jersey.
During his marriage, Casso committed many other infidelities. In an interview with biographer Philip Carlo, Casso recalled, Most all men in my life, everyone I know, had girlfriends. It goes with the territory. Women are drawn to us, the power, the money, and we're drawn to them. But only in passing. Some guys treated their mistresses better than their wife, but that's a fuckin' outrage. No class. Only a "cafone" does that. I never loved any woman but Lillian. She and my family always came first.
Following his arrest inside the house in Mount Olive by the FBI in 1993, Lillian Casso "was incensed, and felt betrayed—violated—used" when she learned that her husband had secretly continued his relationship with Rosemarie Billotti. Even though she eventually agreed to visit her husband in federal prison, for the rest of her life, Lillian Casso, according to Philip Carlo, "could not understand how Anthony could be so deceitful, duplicitous—such a two-faced pig."
Lucchese crime family.
Early criminal career.
Casso was a violent youth, and a member of the infamous South Brooklyn Boys street gang. In 1958, he was arrested after a "rumble" against a rival Irish American gang. Casso later told Carlo that his father Michael visited him at the police station and tried in vain to scare his son straight. He soon caught the eye of Christopher "Christie Tick" Furnari, a Lucchese family mobster and leader of the "19th Hole Crew" in Brooklyn. With Furnari's support, Casso started his career in the Mafia running a small loan sharking operation. Furnari also used Casso as muscle for his gambling and drug dealing rackets. Casso's second arrest, for attempted murder, occurred in 1961, but he was acquitted when the alleged victim refused to identify him as the attacker.
19th Hole Crew.
In 1974, at age 32, he became a "made man" (full member) of the Lucchese family. Casso joined Vincent Foceri's crew that operated from 116th Street in Manhattan and from Fourteenth Avenue in Brooklyn. Shortly after becoming a made man, Casso became close to another rising star in the family, Victor Amuso, and began a partnership that lasted for two decades. The two men committed scores of crimes, including drug trafficking, burglary, the elimination and disposal of police informants, and murder. Casso and Amuso were noticed for their success, and subsequently moved to the more prominent crew operated by Casso's mentor Furnari.
Within Furnari's "19th Hole Crew" both Casso and Amuso led a burglary ring known as "The Bypass Gang", which included expert locksmiths, safe crackers, and experts in security alarm systems. The Bypass Gang is still suspected of committing burglaries in banks and jewelry stores throughout New York City and Long Island. Authorities estimated the Bypass gang stole more than $100 million from safety deposit boxes and vaults during the 1970s and 1980s.
When Furnari was promoted to act as the Lucchese family's "consigliere", he decided to promote Casso to succeed him as "caporegime" of the 19th Hole Crew. Casso declined, suggesting that Amuso be promoted instead; he subsequently became Amuso's trusted right hand.
In December 1985, Casso was approached by "caporegime" Frank DeCicco regarding a planned coup in the Gambino crime family. Gambino "caporegime" John Gotti, whose crew had worked with Casso to conduct drug deals, and other captains, were planning to kill family boss Paul Castellano believing that he was too weak to lead them. Gotti and DeCicco were looking for support among the other Four Families affected by the ongoing Mafia Commission Trial. According to Sammy Gravano, another of Gotti's co-conspirators, DeCicco returned from the meeting saying that Casso had offered the conspirators his unconditional support. 
According to Casso, DeCicco alleged during their meeting that Castellano's carelessness in allowing his own house to be bugged was reason enough to kill him. Casso later told Carlo that he tried to talk DeCicco out of killing a boss without first asking for The Commission's permission. Otherwise, he said, killing Castellano would be a cardinal violation of the rules and all the participants would have to be murdered by the other Four Families. Castellano's murder went ahead anyway on December 16, 1985. Casso later denounced Gotti's actions to Carlo as "the beginning of the end of "our thing"."
As Casso had warned, Lucchese boss Anthony Corallo and Genovese boss Vincent Gigante decided to kill Gotti, DeCicco, and every other conspirator in Castellano's murder. Amuso and Casso were chosen to handle the assassinations, and were instructed to use a car bomb to try and shift suspicion to Sicilian mobsters, or Zips, related to Castellano. While New York City "mafiosi" had long been officially banned from using bombs due to the risk of collateral damage, Sicilian mafiosi and members of the Cleveland crime family were notorious for blowing up their targets. Amuso and Casso made one attempt on the lives of Gotti and DeCicco, planting a bomb in DeCicco's car when the two were scheduled to visit a social club on April 13, 1986. Gotti cancelled at the last minute, and the bomb instead only killed DeCicco and injured a passenger they had mistaken for Gotti.
Taking over the family with Amuso.
In November 1986, Lucchese family boss Anthony Corallo sensed that the Commission Trial would result in a guilty verdict that would ensure the entire Lucchese leadership would die in prison. Corallo, wanting to maintain the family's half-century tradition of a seamless transfer of power, called both Casso and Amuso to Furnari's Staten Island home. Casso turned down the promotion to boss and instead suggested that Amuso become the new boss. Amuso formally took over the family in 1987 and Casso succeeded Furnari as "consigliere." Casso later took over as Underboss in 1989 after Mariano Macaluso retired.
While at the top of the Lucchese family, Amuso and Casso shared huge profits from their family's illegal activities. These profits included: $15,000 to $20,000 a month from extorting Long Island delivery and carting companies; $75,000 a month in kickbacks from eight air freight carriers operating in the New York area in exchange for guaranteed labor peace and no protests from workers over their low benefits; $20,000 a week in profits from illegal, unlicensed video game machines set up in businesses with connections to the Lucchese family; and $245,000 annually from a major family-owned concrete supplier. Amuso and Casso also split more than $200,000 per year from the Garment District protection rackets, as well as a cut of all the crimes committed by the family's soldiers.
In one instance, Casso and Amuso split $800,000 from the Colombo family for Casso's aid in helping them rob steel from a construction site at the West Side Highway in Manhattan. In another instance, the two bosses received $600,000 from the Gambino family for allowing it to take over a Lucchese-protected contractor for a housing complex project on Coney Island. Casso also controlled Greek-American crime boss George Kalikatas, who gave Casso $683,000 protection money in 1990 alone to operate a loan sharking, extortion, and illegal gambling organization in Astoria, Queens.
Eastern European connections.
Casso had a close alliance with Russian boss Marat Balagula, who operated a multibillion-dollar gasoline bootlegging scam in Brighton Beach. Balagula, a Soviet Jewish refugee from Odessa, had arrived in the US under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. After Colombo "capo" Michael Franzese began shaking down his crew, Balagula approached Christopher Furnari, consigliere for the Lucchese crime family, and asked for a sit-down at the 19th Hole Crew's social club in Brooklyn. According to Casso, Furnari declared,
Here there's enough for everybody to be happy...to leave the table satisfied. What we must avoid is trouble between us and the other families. I propose to make a deal with the others so there's no bad blood...Meanwhile, we will send word out that from now on you and your people are with the Lucchese family. No one will bother you. If anyone does bother you, come to us and Anthony will take care of it.
Street tax from Balagula's organization was not only strategically shared, but also became the Five Families' biggest moneymaker after drug trafficking. According to Carlo,
It didn't take long for word on the street to reach the Russian underworld: Marat Balagula was paying off the Italians; Balagula was a punk; Balagula had no balls. Balagula's days were numbered. This, of course, was the beginning of serious trouble. Balagula did in fact have balls—he was a ruthless killer when necessary—but he also was a smart diplomatic administrator and he knew that the combined, concerted force of the Italian crime families would quickly wipe the newly arrived Russian competition off the proverbial map.
Shortly afterward, Balagula's rival, a fellow Russian immigrant named Vladimir Reznikov, drove up to the former's office building in the Midwood section of Brooklyn. Sitting in his car, Reznikov opened fire on the building with an AK-47. One of Balagula's close associates was killed and several secretaries were wounded. Then, on June 12, 1986, Reznikov entered the Rasputin nightclub in Brighton Beach and placed a 9mm Beretta against Balagula's head, demanding $600,000 in exchange for not pulling the trigger. He also demanded a percentage of everything Balagula was involved in. After Balagula promised to get the money, Reznikov threatened him and his family.
Shortly after Reznikov left, Balagula suffered a massive heart attack. He insisted on being treated at his home in Brighton Beach, where he felt it would be harder for Reznikov to kill him. When Casso arrived, he listened to Balagula's story and seethed with fury. Casso later told Carlo that, to his mind, Reznikov had just spat in the face of the entire Cosa Nostra. Casso told Balagula, "Send word to Vladimir that you have his money, that he should come to the club tomorrow. We'll take care of the rest." Balagula responded, "You're sure? This is an animal. It was him that used a machine gun in the office." Casso responded, "Don't concern yourself. I promise we'll take care of him...Okay?" Casso then requested a photograph of Reznikov and a description of his car.
Following the meeting, Casso and Amuso received Furnari's permission to have Reznikov killed. The following day, Reznikov returned to the nightclub, expecting to pick up his money. Upon realizing that Balagula wasn't there, Reznikov launched into a barrage of profanity and stormed back to the parking lot. There, DeMeo crew veteran Joseph Testa walked up behind Reznikov and shot him dead. Testa then jumped into a car driven by Anthony Senter and left Brighton Beach. According to Casso, "After that, Marat didn't have any problems with other Russians."
Cementing power.
In 1988, "Caporegime" Paul Vario died in Federal Prison, and Amuso promoted Alphonse D'Arco to capo of The Vario Crew. In 1990, Amuso selected D'Arco to organize a "Lucchese construction panel". A committee of Lucchese family members, the panel would oversee the Lucchese-controlled unions and construction companies and co-ordinate joint business ventures with the other Five Families of the New York City Cosa Nostra.
Many years later, D'Arco explained his role under Amuso and Casso's leadership of the Lucchese family, "When a job needed to be done, whenever they needed to do something unpleasant to someone, I was the prick chosen by them."
For example, in the infamous "whack Jersey order", Amuso and Casso ordered Al D'Arco and the Vario Crew to murder the Lucchese family's entire Jersey Crew, after caporegime Anthony Accetturo refused a direct order to increase the family's share of their profits. Acceturo was particularly enraged that Casso and Amuso also had ordered the assassination of his wife. Casso alleged during interviews with Philip Carlo that Accetturo had involved his wife in the running of the Jersey Crew and that therefore Accetturo alone was responsible for the contract put on her. Accetturo considered the contract on his wife a violation of the American Mafia's longstanding rule against killing mobsters' relatives who are not involved in the life, and he chose accordingly to break his blood oath and cooperate with the Feds.
Fugitive.
In January 1991, Casso received an early warning, from a secret law enforcement source he referred to as his "crystal ball", about an upcoming federal indictment. Shortly before he and Amuso both went into hiding, Casso summoned Alphonse D'Arco, the "caporegime" of The Vario Crew, to a meeting at the Rodman gun at John Paul Jones Park, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Casso gave D'Arco a list of phone booth numbers and secret addresses and informed D'Arco that he was in charge of the Lucchese crime family until further notice.
D'Arco met with Casso and Amuso twice in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and several times at safe houses in Brooklyn.
In early 1991, Amuso and Casso ordered the murder of made man and "caporegime" Peter Chiodo, a fellow Windows Case defendant who had pleaded guilty without asking their permission. Casso assigned the murder to acting boss Alphonse 'Little Al' D'Arco. The order shocked D'Arco, who knew that Chiodo had been a close friend and confidant of Casso for years.
On May 8, 1991, two Lucchese shooters ambushed Chiodo while he was working on a car at a gas station in Staten Island. Chiodo received 12 bullet wounds in the arms, legs, and torso, but survived the attack. Doctors credited Chiodo's obesity with saving his life, as none of the slugs penetrated a vital organ or artery. However, he sustained several abdominal wounds and permanent damage to his right arm.
Following the unsuccessful assassination attempt, Casso delivered a blunt threat through Chiodo's lawyer that, if Chiodo testified, his wife would be murdered. Despite being common practice in the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta, Casso's threat was a violation of a longstanding American Mafia rule against killing mobsters' relatives who are not involved in, "The Life". While Chiodo had angrily refused every previous offer to flip, Casso's threat to kill his wife was the last straw. He broke his blood oath and became a government witness, by his own account, to protect his family.
Meanwhile, Alphonse D'Arco knew that Amuso and Casso blamed him for having failed to murder Peter Chiodo and grew certain that they were planning to kill him. In July 1991, in a Staten Island meeting, Amuso and Casso replaced D'Arco as acting boss with a four-man panel of capos. While D'Arco was named to this panel, he remained certain that Amuso and Casso no longer trusted him.
On July 29, 1991, due to a tipoff from an unidentified Lucchese insider, Amuso was arrested and Casso became the "de facto" boss of the family. It has been speculated that Casso himself was the source of the leak, as only a few people were privy to Amuso's location. This theory is contradicted by Carlo, who states that Casso was not only determined to find out who betrayed Amuso and kill them, but that Casso immediately sent the $250,000 that was due to Amuso to his wife in a shoe box. Casso, according to Carlo, had no desire to be boss of the Lucchese family and attempted to arrange for Amuso's escape from federal custody after his arrest. To the disappointment of Casso and the Lucchese "capos", Amuso refused to leave prison out of fear for his life. As a result, the Lucchese "capos" asked Casso to take over as acting boss. Casso reluctantly accepted.
By September 21, 1991, Alphonse D'Arco was certain that Amuso and Casso had marked him and his family for death. That afternoon, D'Arco telephoned the suburban Connecticut home of FBI Agent Robert Marston. D'Arco explained that his life was in danger and that the Lucchese family had started killing the entire families of suspected informers, which had never previously been allowed. After some hesitation, D'Arco told Agent Marston that he and his family were in hiding at his mother's house in Long Island. Later that night, D'Arco and his family entered WITSEC.
The defections of both D'Arco and Chiodo opened the door for new murder indictments against Amuso and Casso.
In a further violation of the Mafia's code, Chiodo's extended family in Brooklyn soon suffered retaliation from Amuso and Casso. On March 10, 1992, Vario Crew enforcer Michael Spinelli shot Chiodo's sister, Patricia Capozallo, while she was driving in Bensonhurst. Capozallo sustained bullet wounds in the arm, back and neck but survived.
Also in 1993, Casso ordered George Zappola, Frank "Bones" Papagni, and Lucchese "consigliere" Frank Lastorino, to murder the Lucchese family's Bronx "capo", Steven Crea.
Meanwhile, investigators from the Brooklyn District Attorney's office were using new technology to trace the location of cell phones. Frank Lastorino, they found, was regularly calling a cell phone near Budd Lake, New Jersey. The DA's Office informed FBI Agent Richard Rudolph, who arranged for a Federal warrant allowing Lastorino's phone to be tapped. As FBI Agents listened in, they recognized Casso's voice. On January 19, 1993, Casso was arrested while coming out of the shower at the house he shared with his mistress, Rosemarie Billotti, in Mount Olive, New Jersey.
As FBI Agents searched the house, they found a rifle, $340,000 in cash, a stack of FBI reports that had been provided to Amuso's defense attorneys, and meticulous paperwork about the inner workings of the Lucchese family.
The paperwork included monthly tabulations of how much money Casso and Amuso had received from each of their criminal operations. Casso had also written down a detailed list of the Christmas tribute money he and Amuso had received from each Lucchese crew. There was also a neatly typed list of proposed made men, which was disguised as a list of wedding guests.
Incarcerated boss.
Casso was held at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center pending trial. Facing charges that would have all but assured he would die in prison, he continued ordering hits outside, but also began making escape plans. One plan almost succeeded when a bribed guard cleared him through security. Casso nearly walked out of jail, but was spotted by another guard and thwarted at the last minute. Afterwards, Casso began making plans for Lucchese members to find out what prison buses would be transporting him and arrange an ambush, as well as assassinating the presiding judge, Eugene Nickerson, to buy himself more time.
On February 2, 1993, the body of Frank Signorino, Peter Chiodo's uncle, was found frozen solid in the trunk of a car in East New York. Signorino had been slain by multiple gunshot wounds to the head, which was wrapped in a black plastic bag.
On February 12, 1993, the Lucchese family burned down the garage of Annette Signorino, Peter Chiodo's 95-year-old grandmother, in Gravesend, Brooklyn. Chiodo later told the FBI, that he "couldn't believe someone would try to harm an old woman".
Casso's power came undone when Amuso stripped Casso of his title of underboss, and declared that all Lucchese "mafiosi" should consider him a pariah—in effect, banishing Casso from the family. Amuso had long been suspicious of Casso's failure to use his law enforcement contacts to find out who had betrayed him, and finally concluded Casso did it himself to take control of the family.
The two lead prosecutors on the case, Charles Rose and Gregory O'Connell, later told Jerry Capeci that they had hoped to use Sammy Gravano as a witness against Casso. Gravano refused, as he reportedly feared that Casso would start killing members of his extended family.
Alphonse D'Arco, however, was reportedly very eager to testify against his former friend. According to FBI Agent Lucien Gandolfo, "He thought he was standing for what was right, but also for the old values that had been abandoned by the mob."
Informant.
Facing the prospect of a trial at which D'Arco, Acceturo, and Chiodo were due to be star witnesses against him, as well as spending the rest of his life in prison, Casso reached out to FBI Agent Richard Rudolph and offered to turn informant. Casso was immediately moved to the Federal Prison at La Tuna, near El Paso, Texas and housed in the famous "Valachi Suite" as he debriefed.
At the beginning of the first session, Casso joked, "Every time I stepped out of the house I committed a crime. You expect me to remember all of them?". The agents urged Casso to start by revealing his "crystal ball."
In response, Casso disclosed that decorated NYPD Detectives Stephen Caracappa and Louis Eppolito had been on his payroll and had committed eight murders under his orders. Casso further explained that Detectives Carracappa and Eppolito, who had also served on the Federal Organized Crime Strike Force, had also leaked the names of both Police and FBI informants, which had resulted in many other murders.
Federal Prosecutors Charles Rose and Gregory O'Connell flew from New York City to Texas as the debriefing continued. Casso named scores of other mobsters he had conspired with, including Genovese boss Vincent Gigante. Casso also confessed to having sent hitmen to Federal Prosecutor Charles Rose's home with the intention of having him murdered. Casso also admitted to having plotted the assassination of Federal Judge Nickerson in order to delay his own trial.
Casso initially confessed to twelve murders, but when pressed for details, he admitted to a further twenty-four. At the same time, Casso was found to have lied about how much money he possessed. He also denied all involvement in the murder of Peter Chiodo's uncle or in the arson at the home of Chiodo's elderly grandmother. Increasingly sceptical, the FBI Agents made Casso take a lie detector test, which he failed.
Gregory O'Connell later told Jerry Capeci that the decision not to use Casso as a witness was made in the Valachi Suite, while Casso, "with apparent delight", gleefully laughed as he described how he buried alive a young drug smuggling associate in the Florida Everglades.
As Casso spoke, Federal Prosecutors O'Connell and Rose, "read each other's thoughts. The story would probably not go over well with a jury." Both prosecutors flew back to New York City convinced that Casso's knowledge of Mafia secrets did not matter. O'Connell later told Capeci, "It gets to a point where somebody is just too evil to put on the stand."
Casso finalized a plea agreement at a hearing on March 1, 1994, where he pleaded guilty to 70 crimes, including racketeering, extortion and 15 murders. The two lead prosecutors on the case, Charles Rose and Gregory O'Connell, later said they'd feared Casso could be acquitted at trial, since they did not have any taped conversations as evidence. However, with Casso's guilty plea, O'Connell said they had Casso "tied up six ways to Sunday." While remaining in prison, Casso was placed in the witness protection program.
According to Carlo, when Casso revealed that he also had an FBI Agent on the payroll, prosecutors ordered him to keep quiet. Casso alleges that he further enraged the US government by accusing Gambino turncoat Sammy Gravano, who had denied ever having dealt in drugs, of buying large amounts of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana from Casso over two decades. However, Casso was vindicated to some extent when Gravano pleaded guilty in 2000 to operating a massive narcotics ring, which included selling ecstasy to adolescents. He was the second confessed underboss of a New York crime family to break his blood oath and turn informer, after Gravano.
In 1998, Casso was removed from the witness protection program after prosecutors alleged numerous infractions, in 1997, including bribing guards, assaulting other inmates and making "false statements" about Gravano and D'Arco. Casso's attorney tried to get Judge Frederic Block to overrule federal prosecutors in July 1998, but Block refused to do so. Shortly afterward, Judge Block sentenced Casso to 455 years in prison without possibility of parole—the maximum sentence permitted under sentencing guidelines. 
Casso later told "The New York Times" organized-crime reporter Selwyn Raab that, before turning informer, he was seriously considering a deal that would have allowed him the possibility of parole after 22 years. "I help them and I get life without parole," he said. "This is really a fuckin' joke". Casso lost two subsequent appeals to get his sentence reduced.
In a 2006 letter to Carlo, Casso declared, Dearest Carlo
I am truly regretful for my decision to cooperate with the Government. It was against all my beliefs and upbringing. I know for certain, had my father been alive, I would never have done so. I have disgraced my family heritage, lost the respect of my children and close friends, and most probably added to the sudden death of my wife and confidant for more than 35 years. I wish the clock could be turned back only to bring her back. I have never in my life informed on anyone. I have always hated rats and as strange as it may sound I still do. I surely hate myself, day after day. It would have definitely been different if the Government had honest witnesses from inception. I would have had a second chance to start a new life, and my wife Lillian would still be alive. It seems that the only people the Government awards freedom to are the ones who give prejudiced testimony to win convictions. "The truth will set you free", means nothing in the Federal courts. Even at this point in my life, I consider myself to be a better man than most of the people on the streets these days.
With contempt and disdain

Incarceration and death.
Casso began serving his sentence at the supermax prison ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado. Casso was transferred to the Federal Medical Center (FMC) at the Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, North Carolina, for the treatment of prostate cancer in March 2009. He was returned to ADX Florence in July 2009. In 2013, Casso was transferred to the Federal Residential Reentry Management Office in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This was not a prison facility, but an administrative designation for inmates assigned to home confinement, "halfway houses", or state and county correctional facilities.
As of May 2018, he had been transferred to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, an administrative security/medical prison in Springfield, Missouri. He was later transferred to USP Terre Haute. From March 25, 2020, he was serving his sentence at USP Tucson, a high security prison in Arizona. In his later years, Casso had developed complications related to prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, kidney disease, hypertension, bladder disease and lung issues from years of smoking.
On November 5, 2020, Casso tested positive for COVID-19 while incarcerated, amidst the pandemic in Arizona. He was placed in medical isolation at USP Tucson. On November 9, he was transported to a local hospital due to respiratory distress, and on November 17, 2020, was put on a ventilator. His lawyers requested compassionate release, but that motion was rejected on November 28. Casso died from complications related to COVID-19 on December 15, 2020, at the age of 78.

Paley construction

In mathematics, the Paley construction is a method for constructing Hadamard matrices using finite fields. The construction was described in 1933 by the English mathematician Raymond Paley.
The Paley construction uses quadratic residues in a finite field GF("q") where "q" is a power of an odd prime number. There are two versions of the construction depending on whether "q" is congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4.
Quadratic character and Jacobsthal matrix.
Let "q" be a power of an odd prime. In the finite field GF("q") the quadratic character χ("a") indicates whether the element "a" is zero, a non-zero square, or a non-square:
For example, in GF(7) the non-zero squares are 1 = 12 = 62, 4 = 22 = 52, and 2 = 32 = 42. Hence χ(0) = 0, χ(1) = χ(2) = χ(4) = 1, and χ(3) = χ(5) = χ(6) = −1.
The Jacobsthal matrix "Q" for GF("q") is the "q" × "q" matrix with rows and columns indexed by elements of GF("q") such that the entry in row "a" and column "b" is χ("a" − "b"). For example, in GF(7), if the rows and columns of the Jacobsthal matrix are indexed by the field elements 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, then
The Jacobsthal matrix has the properties "QQ"T = "qI" − "J" and "QJ" = "JQ" = 0 where "I" is the "q" × "q" identity matrix and "J" is the "q" × "q" all 1 matrix. If "q" is congruent to 1 mod 4 then −1 is a square in GF("q")
which implies that "Q" is a symmetric matrix. If "q" is congruent to 3 mod 4 then −1 is not a square, and "Q" is a skew-symmetric matrix. When "q" is a prime number and rows and columns are indexed by field elements in the usual 0, 1, 2, … order, "Q" is a circulant matrix. That is, each row is obtained from the row above by cyclic permutation.
Paley construction I.
If "q" is congruent to 3 mod 4 then
is a Hadamard matrix of size "q" + 1. Here "j" is the all-1 column vector of length "q" and "I" is the ("q"+1)×("q"+1) identity matrix. The matrix "H" is a skew Hadamard matrix, which means it satisfies "H" + "H"T = 2"I".
Paley construction II.
If "q" is congruent to 1 mod 4 then the matrix obtained by replacing all 0 entries in
with the matrix
and all entries ±1 with the matrix
is a Hadamard matrix of size 2("q" + 1). It is a symmetric Hadamard matrix.
Examples.
Applying Paley Construction I to the Jacobsthal matrix for GF(7), one produces the 8 × 8 Hadamard matrix,
For an example of the Paley II construction when "q" is a prime power rather than a prime number, consider GF(9). This is an extension field of GF(3) obtained
by adjoining a root of an irreducible quadratic. Different irreducible quadratics produce equivalent fields. Choosing "x"2+"x"−1 and letting "a" be a root of this polynomial, the nine elements of GF(9) may be written 0, 1, −1, "a", "a"+1, "a"−1, −"a", −"a"+1, −"a"−1. The non-zero squares are 1 = (±1)2, −"a"+1 = (±"a")2, "a"−1 = (±("a"+1))2, and −1 = (±("a"−1))2. The Jacobsthal matrix is
It is a symmetric matrix consisting of nine 3 × 3 circulant blocks. Paley Construction II produces the symmetric 20 × 20 Hadamard matrix,
The Hadamard conjecture.
The size of a Hadamard matrix must be 1, 2, or a multiple of 4. The Kronecker product of two Hadamard matrices of sizes "m" and "n" is an Hadamard matrix of size "mn". By forming Kronecker products of matrices from the Paley construction and the 2 × 2 matrix,
Hadamard matrices of every permissible size up to 100 except for 92 are produced. In his 1933 paper, Paley says “It seems probable that, whenever "m" is divisible by 4, it is possible to construct an orthogonal matrix of order "m" composed of ±1, but the general theorem has every appearance of difficulty.” This appears to be the first published statement of the Hadamard conjecture. A matrix of size 92 was eventually constructed by Baumert, Golomb, and Hall, using a construction due to Williamson combined with a computer search. Currently, Hadamard matrices have been shown to exist for all formula_10 for "m" &lt; 668.

Central Yearly Meeting of Friends

Central Yearly Meeting of Friends is a yearly meeting of Friends (Quaker) churches located in Indiana, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Ohio. Central Yearly Meeting of Friends is a part of the Gurneyite wing of the Orthodox branch of Quakerism, and is aligned with the conservative holiness movement. Meeting for worship is programmed and led by pastors. 
On First-month 31, 1924 (January 31, 1924), the "Union Quarterly Meeting" was formed from monthly meetings that were originally a part of the Western Yearly Meeting; certain monthly meetings that were a part of the Indiana Yearly Meeting formed the "Eastern Quarterly Meeting". The Union and Eastern Quarterly Meetings remained a part of the Five Years Meeting until 1926, when they separated and together became the Central Yearly Meeting on Ninth-month 17th, 1926 (September 17, 1926). The Central Yearly Meeting strongly supported the Richmond Declaration, a confession of faith upheld by the Orthodox branch of Quakerism.
Central Yearly Meeting is associated with Union Bible College. Along with the Northwest Yearly Meeting of Friends, the Central Yearly Meeting of Friends sponsors missionary work in Bolivia.
These Quakers publish a periodical known as the "Friends Evangel". An annual camp meeting is held near Muncie, Indiana, every August.
Members of the Central Yearly Meeting of Friends practice the traditional Quaker teaching of plain dress, part of the Quaker testimony of simplicity. The Central Yearly Meeting lays emphasis on the Quaker doctrine of perfection, which is explicated in "Teaching of Evangelical Friends as Gleaned from George Fox's Journal and Friends Disciplines", by J. Edwin Newby.

The Clue of the Black Keys

The Clue of the Black Keys is the twenty-eighth volume in the Nancy Drew mystery series. It was first published in 1951 under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. The actual authors were ghostwriters Wilhelmina Rankin and Harriet Stratemeyer Adams.
Plot summary.
Professor Terence Scott travels to River Heights to consult with Carson Drew about the disappearance of another professor, Dr. Joshua Pitt. Mr. Drew recommends he discuss the matter with Nancy, as it seems to be more of a mystery than a legal matter. Terry Scott reveals that while on an archaeology expedition in Mexico, he, Dr. Pitt, and two other professors, Dr. Anderson and Dr. Graham, found a clue to an ancient treasure. They discovered three black keys made of obsidian and a stone tablet with a cipher engraved on it. The items and Dr. Pitt both disappeared the next morning. Only a broken half of one of the keys was left behind. Terry suspected foul play by a couple who had been working near the excavation site because they vanished at the same time.
While Nancy and Terry are at the airport, someone grabs Nancy and leaves her bound and gagged, and tries to steal the half-key from Terry's coat pocket. A Sergeant Malloy helps them identify the thief, Juarez Tino, but not until after he escapes on a plane to Florida.
Shaken, Nancy asked her father's advice, and he suggests she talk to the other expedition members. Mr. Drew had drawn up Dr. Pitt's will and he confidentially tells her Terry is the sole heir, as elderly Dr. Pitt was unmarried. Out of caution, they want to be sure Terry is trustworthy. That night, a burglar breaks into the Drew home. Nancy awakens and surprises him. Quickly man seizes her. He ties her up and gags her before she can scream, but is scared off before he can make a search. The black key, which Terry had entrusted to Nancy, remained safe in its hiding place.
Nancy and George meet with Dr. Graham, who clears away any suspicion by emphatically averring the integrity of the four expedition members, despite professional jealousies that might arise. Nancy learns that the evening of the attempted burglary at her home, Terry was bound and gagged in his hotel room and most of the documents from the Mexican expedition were stolen.
Ned Nickerson calls Nancy about attending a dance at Emerson College and asks if she could bring a fraternity brother of his who is scheduled to give a lecture at the college. Ned gives his name as Terence Scott and believes him to be about 60, when in fact he is only 25 and very handsome. Nancy thinks it's a good joke and doesn't reveal the truth to Ned. While en route to Emerson, Nancy and Terry stop for lunch and notice two men observing them intently. As they continue on their way, they round a bend and the car overturns when they hit a deep ditch. Someone had removed the warning signs from the road. After arriving at Emerson, Terry goes to the college president's home and Nancy asks Ned to ensure he is invited to the dance. Ned does so and is surprised when he meets Terry at the dance. Later Nancy learns that the morning of the accident, Bess and George had trailed a suspect named Wilfred Porterly and overheard a telephone conversation indicating plans to harm Nancy.
While at Emerson, Nancy takes a side trip and meets with Dr. Anderson, who tells her Juarez Tino came to see him a while back and offered to reveal the location of the cipher and Dr. Pitt for a price. Angry, Dr. Anderson threw him out of the office.
Nancy and Ned attend Terry's lecture on his Mexican expedition, which is very well-received by the Emerson students.
When Terry returns to River Heights, he is hired to translate an old diary as he is fluent in Spanish and Mexican dialects. The woman who hired him, Lillian Wangell, said the diary belonged to her sea captain grandfather. Due to its subject matter, Terry thinks the diary could yield clues to the ancient treasure connected with the cipher. Knowing of a past charge of fraud against Mrs. Wangell and her husband, Nancy consults a local genealogist who has records of many families in town. She confirms that neither of Mrs. Wangell's grandfathers followed the sea. Nancy urges Terry to be cautious and not to accept the invitation to stay at the Wangells' home. Mrs. Wangell had insisted the diary must remain at her home, so Terry uses a tiny camera Nancy lent him to photograph some of its pages.
Nancy makes tracings of some of the unusual drawings in the diary, and by overlaying them she discovers they form a picture of palm trees, a body of water, and a trail of footsteps.
Carson Drew receives a letter from a Caswell P. Breed in Baltimore claiming to be a relative of Dr. Pitt and demanding part of his estate. Carson Drew has other business to conduct in Baltimore and while there, he and Nancy visit Mr. Breed. They discover he did not send the letter; someone used his name as a ruse to get them out of town. When Nancy returns, she is unable to reach Terry at his hotel, and fearing foul play, goes directly to the Wangell home. The house is boarded up and while she is there, the Wangells depart in a taxi. Nancy circles the home and sees a distress signal of a handkerchief waving from an attic ventilator. She investigates, but Mr Wangell suddenly returns and subdues her. She is bound and gagged, and the man locks her in the attic along with Terry. The police later arrive and they discover Nancy and Terry imprisoned in the attic. Terry relates that Mrs. Wangell and Mrs. Porterly are sisters and are connected to the mystery.
Terry departs for Mexico to continue searching for Dr. Pitt. Nancy believes Juarez Tino and his wife and the Wangells are in Florida. She makes to plans to join a group of students Dr. Anderson is taking to Miami for a field trip to study the Indian tribes in that area. But Dr. Anderson tells her she must pass the same test his students are taking in order to go. Nancy studies diligently and answers all the essay questions except one. She is uncertain whether she will receive a passing grade. While awaiting the news, Nancy and Hannah hear fire engine sirens and discover a house two doors down is filling with acrid smoke. Nancy courageously ventures inside to search for a missing three-year-old. She rescues him and returns to the Drew home to find Juarez Tino leaving her bedroom with the black half-key. He had been responsible for instigating the neighbors' plight as a diversion. Nancy is able to wrest the key away from him but he overpowers her and gets it back, then starts to tie her up. Terrified for her life, Nancy screams for help, but he covers her mouth with his hand. As he pulls a handkerchief from his pocket to gag her, Nancy sees the key fly out but he doesn't notice it. He finishes tying Nancy up, then puts her under the bed. He escapes as Hannah returns and finds Nancy. They search for the key to no avail. George and Bess arrive and George finds the key in the navy blue blanket Tino had used to further bind Nancy. The ringing telephone brings the good news that Nancy passed the test.
As the plane containing the students and Dr. Anderson nears Miami, it loses altitude and exhibits other warning signs after narrowly avoiding another plane that buzzed right by it. Miraculously, the pilot is able to land on an island. It is discovered that a cable broke during the dodging maneuver, and this jeopardized the plane's operation. The group later learns that the perpetrators expected this to happen and had deemed it a better method of attack than directly tampering with the plane.
Dr. Anderson give Nancy permission to work on a special assignment with a student named Fran Oakes: to look for a Florida Key known as Black Key. Fran's cousin, Jack Walker, has a motorboat and he takes them to visit a man named Two Line Parker, who knows the history of the Florida Keys. The fisherman tells them of the sinking of a ship called the Black Falcon near one of the keys. Nancy believes that is the right island but they know only its general location.
While investigating a vacant home the Porterlys had rented in South Florida, Nancy finds partially burned letters in an incinerator in the back yard. A scrap contains a mention of her name and the date of the 15th. It is currently December 13.
While motorboating among the Keys, the group sees Juarez Tino in a speedboat. Nancy tries to follow him, but he kidnaps her and ties her up, and puts her in his boat. Struggling frantically, Nancy manages to get the gag out of her mouth and screams, bringing rescue. Her friends try to follow Juarez Tino, but they lose his trail. Shaken, Nancy nonetheless decides to return to the vicinity the next day. Dr. Anderson isn't able to go, but Terry Scott has arrived and he joins the expedition with Nancy, Fran, and Jack.
Making use of another clue she had found early, Nancy consults a local fisherman and learns of a group of five islands near a group of seven islands and a single island set apart. They head to the single island and while traversing it a plane flies overhead. The group fears they had been seen. They discover a hut in which Dr. Pitt is imprisoned but no one else is present. Jack and Fran leave to summon the police. Dr. Pitt tells Nancy and Terry the criminals had set a deadline of December 15 (the next day) for him to give them information. While they are talking, the Tinos and the Wangells arrive, having been alerted by the pilot. Nancy and her friends are captured and tied up. Mrs. Tino snatches the half-key Nancy is wearing around her neck after overhearing her say she has it. The criminals force Dr. Pitt to reveal information about the treasure by threatening to harm Nancy if he doesn't. He tells them it is in remote part of a jungle in Mexico.
Juarez Tino and Earl Wangell immediately depart with Dr. Pitt to travel to Mexico and search for the treasure, leaving Nancy and Terry in the custody of their wives. Nancy learns Mrs. Wangell is afraid of her husband and had been coerced into criminal activity. The police soon arrive and free Nancy and Terry, who set out for Mexico also, hoping to arrive before the others. Dr. Anderson and Dr. Graham accompany them, and they enlist the help of some Mexican policemen. The information from the diary helps them locate the trail leading to the treasure site. They stop and wait on the trail, and soon the other party arrives, with elderly Dr. Pitt nearly exhausted. They proceed on and Tino and Wangell are commissioned to dig at the site. A box is unearthed and the three keys fit the locks. Inside the box are several jewel-encrusted frogs made of silver, and a larger silver frog that contains an ancient green powder. Dr. Pitt declares the treasures belong to the government of Mexico. However, he fearfully believes the green substance is destructive and could wipe out civilization. Terry's research instead suggests that it has healing properties. Dr. Pitt listens to Terry's reasoning and agrees with his opinion. The four scientists are excited to announce their discovery to the world.

Lloyd Railroad Depot

The Lloyd Railroad Depot (also known as Bailey's Mill Station or Number Two Station) is a historic depot building in Lloyd, Florida in the United States. Built in 1858 by the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad, it is the oldest brick railroad station in Florida and one of only three surviving railroad depots in the state built prior to the start of the American Civil War. The Seaboard Air Line Railroad operated a local New Orleans - Jacksonville train on the line, making flag stops at the station, while the better known "Gulf Wind" passed through without stopping.
The building closed in 1966 after its owner at the time, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, discontinued that local service and donated it to the Jefferson County Historical Society. A few years later, ownership was transferred to the Gulf Wind Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society, who own it to this day. On December 2, 1974, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The structure is located near the junction of SR 59 and Lester Lawrence Road. It is currently used as a post office.

War canoe

A war canoe is a watercraft of the canoe type designed and outfitted for warfare, and which is found in various forms in many world cultures. In modern times, such designs have become adapted as a sport, and "war canoe" can mean a type of flatwater racing canoe.
History.
War canoes were used in Africa, Austronesia, Americas and Europe to transport troops and supplies, and engage targets onshore. While documentation of canoe versus canoe battles on the open ocean is rare, records from the 14th century mention various peoples of West Africa using huge fighting canoes in inland waters, some up to and carrying over 100 men. Construction of the war canoe was typically from one massive tree trunk, with the silk cotton tree being particularly useful. The inside was dug out and carved using fire and hand tools. Braces and stays were used to prevent excessive expansion while the fire treatment was underway. Fire also served to release sap as a preservative against insect pests. Some canoes had of width inside, accommodating benches for rowers, and facilities such as fireplaces and sleeping berths.
Warriors on board were typically armed with shield, spear and bow. In the gunpowder era, small iron or brass cannon were sometimes mounted on the bow or stern, although the firepower delivered from these areas and weapons was relatively ineffective. Musketeers delivering fire to cover raiding missions generally had better luck. The typical tactic was to maneuver close to shore, discharge weapons, then quickly pull out to open water to reload, before dashing in again to repeat the cycle. Troop and supply transport were the primary missions, but canoe versus canoe engagements in the lagoons, creeks and lakes of West Africa were also significant.
War canoe racing.
War canoe is largely a Canadian sport, with some teams coming from the northwestern United States as well; it is not sanctioned by the International Canoe Federation but is nonetheless an important part of most Canadian canoe club racing programs. The term 'war canoe' is derived from large indigenous peoples' canoes intended for war, and war canoeing was in fact a popular sport in British Columbia before large gatherings of indigenous people were outlawed in 1922. War canoeing among indigenous communities is enjoying a revival today, and there as starting to be inclusion with non-indigenous paddlers.
A war canoe of Canadian settler conception holds 15 paddlers including one coxswain, or cox, for steering. War canoe is sometimes referred to as C-15 on regatta schedules, with the 'C' standing for 'canoe'. The paddlers, 7 to a side and slightly offset from one another, kneel on one knee while paddling. The coxswain stands with their calves braced between a yoke on the back of the boat. Paddlers on the left will kneel on their left knee and vice versa, as in a Sprint canoe, and the foremost paddler, whether on the right or left, will set the stroke. Boats are most often constructed of wood, although some newer boats will be made of fiberglass. Races will typically be of 500 m or 1000 m. And on rare occasions, 1500 m. The paddles used can be made of wood, but carbon fibre paddles are becoming standard, as their reduced weight leads to improved performance.
War canoe is seen as a prestige event at regattas where it is held, as it allows a significant portion of a club's racing members to be in the boat at once and compete together. It is a large team event in a sport that typically focusses on individual achievements. Crews will be taken from the appropriate age range (e.g. Bantam, junior, masters, etc.), and races are held for men's, women's, or mixed crews.
Typically, a war canoe will be faster than a 20 paddler dragon boat over any given distance, because of a more hydrodynamically streamlined hull shape (narrower and without the characteristic 'w' shape of dragon boat hulls making for reduced wetted surface area and drag), and the kneeling position allowing for a fuller, more powerful stroke than the sitting position used in a dragon boat; as well as larger blade powerface surface area and longer shaft of the paddle. However, there are dragonboats raced with 50 or more paddlers, as well as other cultural paddled long narrow boats, that pace at much higher speeds than either C-15 and DB-22 racing shells.

Redonda Beach

Redonda Beach or "Praia Redonda" in Portuguese, meaning Round, is a beach on the southwestern coast of Póvoa de Varzim, Portugal, bordering the Atlantic Ocean. It is adjacent to Passeio Alegre, in Póvoa de Varzim City Center. The Avenida dos Banhos runs alongside the beach, and the Diana Bar beach library, a nightclub and Café Guarda-sol are located on the beach.
The beach has medium sand and little granitic gneiss, typical rocky outcrops on Póvoa de Varzim coastline, the largest concentration is Carvalhido outcrop, which serves as the north limit of the beach. Salgueira Beach is located to the North and the Port of Póvoa de Varzim to the south. These beaches have a specific climate, by showing low diurnal temperature variation, just 4 °C (= 7.2 °F). Compared with the rest of the territory, rainfall is significantly lower and solar irradiation higher. These are subject to the prevailing northern winds which arise in the summer after midday; hence mornings are significantly less windy.
History.
The beach is historically known as "Praia de Banhos", Portuguese for Bathing Beach, contrasting with the Fisheries Beach (used for fishing and with very fine sand), currently the Port of Póvoa de Varzim. it is the historical bathing beach of Póvoa de Varzim, that in the 19th century became the most popular tourist destination in Northern Portugal. Ramalho Ortigão, in the book "As Praias de Portugal" (The Beaches of Portugal), states that Póvoa de Varzim is the great hostel for the inhabitants of the Minho province, for sea bathing or breathing the Sea air, as the marine layer is occasionally propelled to the beach by the south and western maritime winds during summertime, leaving an intense aroma. Ortigão states that in that time no other beach had such diversity and popularity.
In 1844, the chapel of Saint Joseph was built in there, and there was a street known as Rua da Areosa. The street was enlarged and became the Passeio Alegre square and the chapel demolished by beautification of the beaches square. A new chapel was built on Avenida Mousinho de Albuquerque to replace it. However, in the 1930s, beach bars were constructed in the location of the chappel: Diana Bar and Café Guardassol, the later was, at first, a famed 1920s wooden building, causing local debate. In the 1970s, Café Enseada was built and, in the 21st century, a new wooden building, the Maresia Café.

JDS Ōshio

JDS "Ōshio" (SS-561) was a submarine in service with Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. "Ōshio" was planned and built to replace the aging JDS "Kuroshio".
Background.
In 1955, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force received a loan from the United States Navy (USN) for the and recommissioned the vessel as the first JDS "Kuroshio" to begin the development (reconstruction) of the submarine force. Subsequently, by building the first in the 1956 plan, domestic construction of submarines was resumed. In the subsequent First Defense Build-up Plan, from the perspective of arranging the numbers, the development of a small submarine (SSK) for local defense, which was modeled after the "Barracuda" class of the USN, was promoted, and the plan for 1959. Then, the "Yashio" type, the "Natsushio" type was built in the 1960 plan.
However, these small submarines had serious restrictions on their snorkeling and surface navigation capabilities, especially in stormy weather, which became a serious problem in submarine operations in the waters near Japan. In addition, since the USN had changed its policy to develop a large submarine such as the , the Maritime Self-Defense Force also decided to build a larger submarine (SSL) with excellent seakeeping. Based on this, first, as a substitute ship for JDS "Kuroshio", only one ship was built in the plan of 1958.
Design.
The design of this ship uses the same technology as SSK, and is expanded to almost the same size as the original "Kuroshio".
Her ship type is an underwater high-speed nautical submarine similar to SSK. The hull structure is also based on the same double-shell type as SSK, but for slimming down, the rear part is a single-shell type and is a partial single-shell type. As for the material of the pressure hull, NS46 tempered high-strength steel (yield strength 46 kgf / mm2 / 451MPa), which was limited only to the frame in 35SSK, was fully adopted.
The propulsion system was a diesel-electric system, the propulsion device was a two-axis system, and the basic configuration was the system since 31SS. As a diesel engine, two V-type 16-cylinder Kawasaki / MAN V8V 24 / 30m MAL were installed. This is based on the 31SS V8V 22 / 30m MAL, with the bore (piston diameter) expanded to increase the output, and has since been followed up to the Yuushio type (50SS). [6].
For electric propulsion, two Fuji Electric SG-3 traction motors (1,200 kW) and two Fuji Electric SM-3 traction motors (1,450 horsepower on water / 3,150 horsepower underwater), and 480 SCB-47W main storage batteries (120). Group x 4 groups) was installed. The SCB-47W main storage battery is a water-cooled agitated fiber-clad lead battery similar to SSK, but its life is longer and its discharge capacity is lower than before.
The propeller is the same 5-sho screw propeller (453 rpm) as before, but the airfoil has been improved and the material has been changed to aluminum bronze.
Equipment.
The sonar arrangement is similar to the , but for the hearing device (passive sonar), the JQO-3 is located at the bottom of the bow and the JQO-4 is located inside the dome at the front end of the sail. As an active sonar, the JQS-3 was mounted on the bottom of the ship below the command post in a hanging manner, similar to the 35SSK. The periscope used to be a 10-meter type, but has since been increased to a 13-meter type.
Six torpedo tubes were placed on the bow and two at the stern. All of these are , but the one on the bow side is the hydraulically-fired HU-601, while the one on the stern side is the swimout type HU-201, which is used to protect the ship when evacuating. It was envisioned to launch a Mk.37 mod.0-N short torpedo ( diameter). However, this equipment method was evaluated as having limited effectiveness, and it is said that it was never used. The number of torpedoes installed was 18 for Mk.54 torpedoes and Mk.37 mod.0-N, and 6 torpedoes were installed at the stern.
Construction and career.
"Ōshio" was laid down on 29 June 1963 and launched on 30 April 1964 by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Kobe Shipyard. She was commissioned on 31 March 1965 and incorporated into the 1st Submarine Group 2nd Submarine. On 8 April 1967, while moored at Kure, a short circuit occurred in the rear control panel room while charging the storage battery, and a fire broke out from a large discharge. At this time, the inner shell was partially melted and after that, it was operated with a limit on the dive depth.
From 25 January to 14 April 1969, she participated in Hawaii dispatch training. On 26 January 1970, while "Ōshio" was surfacing in Hiroshima Bay, she came into contact with a small tanker (186 tonnes) and broke two propeller shafts.
From 22 September to 10 December 1971, she participated in Hawaii dispatch training.
"Ōshio" was decommissioned on 20 August 1981 and dismantled in March 1982. The media was allowed to film inside the vessel before dismantling.

The Ringmaster's Secret

The Ringmaster's Secret is the thirty-first volume in the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series. It was first published in late 1953 under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. The actual author was ghostwriter Harriet Stratemeyer Adams.
Plot summary.
1953 Edition: Nancy's Aunt Eloise, aware of her niece's current interest in learning horseback riding stunts, sends her a second-hand golden bracelet bearing charms of horses in all five gaits; a sixth charm is missing. Coincidentally, the Sims Circus, former employer of Nancy's equestrian instructor, is coming to town. Nancy investigates the link between the unhappy circus star, young aerialist, Lolita, and her bracelet. Lolita is the adopted daughter of the acting manager, Ringmaster Kroon, and his wife. Pietro, the young, handsome clown, tells Nancy Lolita has the missing charm from her bracelet. Nancy's regular appearances at the circus, and her detective reputation brings the ire of Kroon. When a bareback rider is injured, Nancy is asked to join the show as her replacement. Bess Marvin stands in at an interview with Kroon, and agrees to audition later, while Nancy lightens her hair and cuts it to resemble her friend. Nancy's travels with the circus come to an abrupt end when she and George are kidnapped by the Ringmaster. He grabs the two girls when they are investigating the circus. He quickly gags them so neither of the girls can scream, and drags them to an empty freight car bound for parts unknown. There he ties both the girls up and leaves them. After their escape, Nancy continues following up on clues, including a mysterious woman in England linked to both the bracelet and Lolita. In the climax of the story, Nancy is rescued by Ned when Kroon tries to imprison her in the lion's cage, and all is revealed.
Commentary.
This is the first volume that Harriet Stratemeyer Adams, manager and co-owner of The Stratemeyer Syndicate, is credited with writing in full.
1974 Edition: the story is a shortened and abridged version of the original, lacking detail in the subplots, and quickening the pace. Nancy uses a wig to resemble Bess, as well, since her hair is titian in the revision. The story is basically a simplified version of the original.
Book Club Edition.
In 1959, this volume was the second in a series released as part of the Nancy Drew Reader's Club, nicknamed by adult collectors as "Cameos," so named in reference to the jacket and cover design elements of Nancy on a cameo pendant. Nancy is illustrated as mature, dressed in tailored clothes, in this series of book club editions with illustrations by Polly Bolian. The books featured eight internal illustrations on double pages, and a color frontispiece, which was also reproduced as the cover art on a paper dust jacket. The books removed prior- and next-book notices and promotions, and all other details that would serve to sequence the books. Nancy is shown as willowy, with short, wavy hair, and a more mature appearance than her counterpart in the regularly issued series of books.
Critiques.
Adult book collectors and enthusiasts discuss and review Nancy Drew plot elements online. The premise of this volume is sometimes discussed regarding suspension of disbelief that Nancy is as skilled as a high-grade circus performer, and can easily enter the circus as a replacement performer. The original art was executed in 1953 by illustrator Rudy Nappi, and shows a poised and polished Nancy in a typical 1950s shirtdress with Lolita as Kroon discovers their escape. Artist Polly Bolian illustrated the same cover scene for her 1959 book club dust jacket and frontispiece, correcting the time of day to sunrise, and featuring Nancy in a smart suit with matching pumps and bag. In 1974, Nappi updated his art to a collage of the ringmaster and Nancy as a bareback rider in costume. An unknown artist executed less artistic internal illustrations showing Nancy and her friends wearing mostly bell-bottom jeans and t-shirts for the updated edition. This is the cover and text in print currently by Simon and Schuster.

Paul Ryder

Paul Anthony Ryder (24 April 1964 – 15 July 2022) was an English musician. He was a bass player and a founding member of the Manchester band Happy Mondays with his brother Shaun Ryder.
Early life.
Paul and Shaun are the two sons of Derek Ryder, a postman, and his wife Linda, a nurse.
Happy Mondays.
Ryder was an active member of the band through most of its history from its inception in 1983 through to his death. His bandmates include his brother Shaun, Gary Whelan, Mark "Bez" Berry, Paul Davies and Mark Day. It was during his tenure with the band that it had its biggest successes with albums such as "Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches" which sold more than 400,000 copies in the UK. The Ryder brothers fell out in the 1990s as both brothers struggled with heroin addiction, but he rejoined the band for their 2012 comeback.
Acting.
Ryder appeared in the films "The Ghosts of Oxford Street", "Losing It", and "24 Hour Party People", where he played the part of a gangster.
Other projects.
Ryder left Happy Mondays to write music for several television shows, including Turn on Terry for ITV1, Baby's Birth Day for Granada TV and Forensics School for Discovery. He then formed a new band, Big Arm, who released an album in 2008 titled "Radiator". He also played bass for Ian Brown on one of his solo tours.
Ryder lived in Los Angeles where he continued to write music. He supported Tom Tom Club on two of the dates on the North America tour in October 2010, playing gigs in San Francisco and Los Angeles. He was joined by Eddy Gronfier, Neo Garcia on drums and Matt Cheadle on guitar.
In the months leading up to his death, he recorded a video podcast, The Paul Ryder Tapes, with his ex-wife, journalist and TV producer Angela Smith, detailing his life and the history of Happy Mondays. The podcast reached number one in both the UK and Ireland music podcast charts. He completed it just 12 days before his death and it was released in July 2023, a year on from his death. 
Death.
Ryder was found dead by his mother on 15 July 2022, aged 58, the day the band were due to play at a festival in Sunderland. He had been reporting headaches upon arriving in Salford after flying from his home in Los Angeles. The family later reported that the coroner had said that Ryder died as a result of Ischaemic heart disease and diabetes, but they were waiting for the full coroner's report to be released.

James Hawthorne

James Burns Hawthorne (27 March 1930 - 7 September 2006) was BBC Controller in Northern Ireland for 10 years from 1979 to 1989 and as such was the senior editorial figure in the organisation throughout a decade of the Northern Ireland Troubles.
Early life and education.
Hawthorne, one of identical twins was born on 27 March 1930 in Belfast, he was educated at the Methodist College Belfast and Queen's University Belfast. He began work in Belfast in 1951 as a maths teacher at Sullivan Upper School and joined BBC Northern Ireland as a radio producer in the Schools Department in 1960.
Work with the BBC.
He was deeply involved in the fight to preserve the editorial independence of the BBC in Northern Ireland after the so-called "Real Lives" controversy when Margaret Thatcher's cabinet called for a current affairs programme to be pulled from the schedule. Hawthorne's stance in standing up to government pressure, at no small cost to himself, makes him one of the most significant figures in the story of UK broadcasting in the latter half of the twentieth century. His background in education was apparent in his time as Controller of BBC Northern Ireland, where he expanded education and drama, and encouraged local dramatists to create work about Northern Ireland for international audiences. He also introduced Irish-language broadcasts, reversing a BBC Dominions Office ban from the 1930s on Gaelic broadcasting in the UK.
Retirement and death.
After his retirement he remained in Northern Ireland where he held the chair of the Community Relations Council, Health Promotion Agency, Prison Arts Foundation and instigator and mainstay of the Ulster History Circle.
He died on 7 September 2006 after a short illness. BBC NI Controller Anna Carragher said she was deeply saddened by the death of Dr. Hawthorne who led the BBC in some of the most trying years of The Troubles. "He had an enormous dedication and commitment to the BBC."

<doc id="6900131" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6900131" title="CBASIC">
CBASIC

CBASIC is a compiled version of the BASIC programming language written for the CP/M operating system by Gordon Eubanks in 1976–1977. It is an enhanced version of BASIC-E.
History.
BASIC-E was Eubank's master's thesis project. It was developed in PL/M by Eubanks for Gary Kildall's new CP/M operating system while both men were at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. BASIC-E was based on a BASIC compiler originally written by Gary Kildall in 1974.
Because it was developed at public expense, BASIC-E is in the public domain and cannot be marketed exclusively. Seymour Rubinstein, the marketing director of IMSAI contacted Eubanks and asked him to create a saleable version under contract for the IMSAI 8080 microcomputer. Eubanks developed CBASIC in his spare time while he was still a naval officer stationed on the submarine USS "George Washington" at Vallejo, California. He retained joint ownership of the program with IMSAI, and sold CB80 through his own company, "Compiler Systems" until it was acquired by Digital Research in 1981.
Features.
BASIC-E and early versions of CBASIC compiled source code into an intermediate p-code file, which was then executed by a separate run-time interpreter program. CBASIC could execute in a minimum of 24 KB of memory. Line numbers in the program source were optional, unless needed as a label for a program jump. CBASIC proved very popular because it incorporated 14-digit binary-coded decimal (BCD) math which eliminated MBASIC's rounding errors that were sometimes troublesome for accounting.
CBASIC2 adds the following features:
Reception.
"InfoWorld" in 1980 described CBASIC as the "primary language for the development of commercial CP/M applications", because of developers' widespread familiarity with BASIC and ability to distribute royalty-free binaries without source code to CBASIC owners. The magazine stated that the language had become popular "despite serious drawbacks", including the required preprocessor for interpreted source code making debugging difficult, slow speed, and incompatible changes. Despite noting "irritants", Jerry Pournelle in December 1980 praised CBASIC's design and documentation. He said that BASCOM produced much faster binaries without CBASIC's awkward edit-compile-run-debug loop, however. In May 1982 he said that "advantages abound" in CB80 compared to BASCOM, such as the ability to redimension arrays, and superior garbage collection. Pournelle assured readers that the documentation was far superior to the usual Digital Research manuals. He denounced, however, the $2000 annual fee to sell software using CB80 as "sheer madness". In September 1982 Pournelle said that CB80 "remains a real competitor to Pascal and PL/I [with] few of the inherent defects of BASIC", citing its local variables and Pascal-like functions, and approved of its new, freer licensing. He said in May 1983 that Digital Research had "practically ruin[ed]" Eubanks' CBASIC manual after acquiring his company, but that the new edition was much better.

The Phantom of Pine Hill is the forty-second volume in the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series. It was first published in 1965 under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. The actual author was ghostwriter Harriet Stratemeyer Adams.
Plot.
Nancy Drew, along with her friends Bess and George, arrive for the Emerson University June Week celebration. There is a mix-up with the motel reservations, but Ned comes to the rescue. Afterward, Ned and Nancy go to a dance, where a young waiter, Fred, spills drinks on Nancy's dress. After cleaning up, Nancy realizes that her pearl necklace is missing, leading her to a baffling mystery. John Rorick, a descendant of the early settlers of the town, invites the three girls as his guests at his historic mansion on Pine Hill.
After they arrive, Rorick tells them of the phantom who haunts the mansion's library. He also relates the family saga of a lost French wedding gown and of valuable gifts and gold coins that were lost in the sinking of the "Lucy Belle" ship one hundred years ago. Rorick departs, leaving the sleuths with his housekeeper for most of the story. Nancy works with her friends, Ned, and the police to solve the mystery. After her discovery of a secret passage to the library from the chimney, the suspicion turns on Fred and his father.
In between enjoying the university's June Week, river pageant, and fraternity events, Nancy and her friends work diligently to solve the mystery of Pine Hill and locate the long-lost wedding treasures.

Annalena Tonelli

Annalena Tonelli (2 April 1943 – 5 October 2003) was an Italian Catholic lay missionary and social activist. She worked for 33 years in East Africa, where she focused on tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, campaigns for eradication of female genital mutilation, and special schools for hearing-impaired, blind and disabled children. In June 2003, Tonelli was awarded the Nansen Refugee Award, which is given annually by the UNHCR to recognize outstanding service to the cause of refugees. In October 2003, she was killed inside her hospital by two gunmen. 
In February 2020, the Bishop of Forlì-Bertinoro, Livio Corazza, and Bishop of Djibouti, Giorgio Bertin, has jointly initiated the preliminary steps of opening Tonelli's cause for beatification.
Biography.
Annalena Tonelli was born in 1943 in Forlì, Italy. She studied Law, becoming a lawyer after graduation.
After "six years of service to poor people of the suburbs, to orphan children, mentally or physically disabled or abused kids" of her own town, in 1969, the then 25-year-old Tonelli went to Africa supported by the "Committee Against World Hunger" of Forlì, that she had helped to start its activity.
Kenya.
Wajir.
In 1969, Tonelli moved to Kenya, where she began working as a teacher at Wajir Secondary School. After some years she studied to be a nurse too and spent over a decade in the town of Wajir caring for the destitute and ill.
Already in 1976, Tonelli became responsible for a World Health Organization (WHO) pilot project for treating tuberculosis in nomadic people. Tonelli invited nomadic tuberculotic patients to camp in front of the "Rehabilitation Centre for Disabled" she was running with other female volunteers who joined her to serve poliomyelitic, blind, deaf-mute, and disabled people. This approach guaranteed patients' compliance in taking the therapy over the needed six-month treatment, and it was adopted by WHO as DOTS (Directly Observed Therapy Short).
Tonelli also created a deaf school in Wajir whose graduates have gone to other parts of Somali-speaking Africa to start schools. A former pupil from this Wajir deaf school and two deaf women from Wajir established the first schools of Somali Sign Language.
In 1984, following political and inter-clan clashes, the army of Kenya started a repression campaign against the Degodia Somali clan in the Wajir area known as the Wagalla Massacre. The Degodia were suspected of being Shifta or bandits along the roadways. The Kenyan military rounded up 5000 men and boys and brought them to the Wagalla Airstrip and forced them to lie on the stomachs naked for 5 days. Possibly a thousand were shot, tortured or died of exposure. Annalena brought a couple lorries and her Toyota Serf to the Wagalla Airstrip and attempted to collect the bodies and treat the wounded but was refused. Later she followed the tracks of the military vehicles who were dumping the bodies outside the Wagalla Airstrip. Some were not dead and she rescued them. She brought a journalist to photograph the genocide. She smuggled the photos out with Barbara Lefkow, the wife of an American diplomat to put pressure on the international community. The public denunciation by Annalena Tonelli helped to stop the killings but not before thousands died. The Wagalla Massacre is Kenya's worst human rights violation in its history. Arrested and taken in front of a martial court she was told that the fact she escaped two ambushes was not a guarantee to survive a third one. Due to Tonelli's vehement protests over the Kenyan military's use of violence against the Wajir community, the Kenyan authorities refused to extend her work permit. Tonelli subsequently relocated to Somalia.
Somalia and Somaliland.
Tonelli first settled in the southern port town of Merca, which during the colonial period was part of Italian Somaliland. She later moved to Borama in the northwestern Awdal region, a town in the former British Somaliland protectorate. Tonelli would spend the next 19 years working in Somalia.
In Borama, Tonelli founded a tuberculosis hospital on the grounds of a colonial period facility. Her family and friends in Italy helped finance the hospital, contributing $20,000 a month for maintenance.
Death.
In October 2003, Tonelli was assassinated at the tuberculosis hospital she started in Borama by unknown gunmen. There are several rumors about why she was killed. The most plausible is that she was killed by a group who protested her bringing HIV/AIDS patients into Borama. In November 2002, hundreds of protesters marched in front of her Borama hospital throwing stones and shouting "Death to Annalena." They felt she was spreading the disease in their city. Other rumors say she was killed by a disgruntled former worker who felt she owed him a job or that she was killed by men belonging to Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya.
Two weeks after Tonelli's assassination, Dick and Enid Eyeington were murdered in their flat at the SOS Sheikh Secondary School in the town of Sheekh, situated in northwestern Somaliland. The assassins possibly belonged to the same terror cell. They were reportedly arrested in 2004, tried and sentenced to death under a local court.
Awards.
In June 2003, Tonelli was presented the Nansen Refugee Award. The prize is given annually by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to recognize outstanding service to the cause of refugees.

Thomas Jefferys

Thomas Jefferys ( 1719 – 1771), "Geographer to King George III", was an English cartographer who was the leading map supplier of his day. He engraved and printed maps for government and other official bodies and produced a wide range of commercial maps and atlases, especially of North America.
Early work.
As "Geographer to the Prince of Wales", he produced "A Plan of all the Houses, destroyed &amp; damaged by the Great Fire, which began in Exchange Alley Cornhill, on Friday March 25, 1748". He produced "The Small English Atlas" with Thomas Kitchin, and he engraved plans of towns in the English Midlands.
Maps of North America.
In 1754, Jefferys published a "Map of the Most Inhabited Part of Virginia" which had been surveyed by Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson in 1751. The next year he published a map of New England surveyed by John Green, and in 1768 he published "A General Topography of North America and the West Indies" in association with Robert Sayer. In 1775, after his death, collections of his maps were published by Sayer as "The American Atlas" and "The West-India Atlas". "The American Atlas" was reissued in 1776, expanded in response to growing hostilities between the British and the Americans; it contains maps by Joshua Fry, Peter Jefferson, Lewis Evans, and others.
In 1754, Jefferys took a robust and public stance in the controversy with the French on the boundary of Nova Scotia and Acadia, which arose in the time and context of Father Le Loutre's War, which is commonly held to have begun in 1749 and ended with the expulsion of the Acadians in 1755.
Jefferys posthumously lent his name in 1776 to "The American Atlas: Or, A Geographical Description Of The Whole Continent Of America". It contains works by, amongst others, Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson.
Maps of English counties.
Jefferys commissioned surveys and published maps of several English counties. These were large-scale maps with several sheets for each county; in the case of Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire the scale was two inches to one mile (1:31680).
After the death of Jefferys, these maps were re-issued by other map publishers such as William Faden.

The medium is the message

"The medium is the message" is a phrase coined by the Canadian communication theorist Marshall McLuhan and the name of the first chapter in his "", published in 1964. McLuhan proposes that a communication medium itself, not the messages it carries, should be the primary focus of study. The concept has been applied by others in discussions of technologies from television to the Internet.
McLuhan's theory.
McLuhan uses the term "message" to signify content and character. The content of the medium is a message that can be easily grasped and the character of the medium is another message which can be easily overlooked. McLuhan says "Indeed, it is only too typical that the 'content' of any medium blinds us to the character of the medium". For McLuhan, it was the medium itself that shaped and controlled "the scale and form of human association and action". Taking the movie as an example, he argued that the way this medium played with conceptions of speed and time transformed "the world of sequence and connections into the world of creative configuration and structure". Therefore, the message of the movie medium is this transition from "lineal connections" to "configurations." Extending the argument for understanding the medium as the message itself, he proposed that the "content of any medium is always another medium" – thus, speech is the content of writing, writing is the content of print, and print itself is the content of the telegraph.
McLuhan frequently punned on the word "message", changing it to "mass age", "mess age" and "massage". A later book, "The Medium Is the Massage" was originally to be titled "The Medium is the Message", but McLuhan preferred the new title, which is said to have been a printing error.
Concerning the title, McLuhan wrote: The title "The Medium Is the Massage" is a teaser—a way of getting attention. There's a wonderful sign hanging in a Toronto junkyard which reads, 'Help Beautify Junkyards. Throw Something Lovely Away Today.' This is a very effective way of getting people to notice a lot of things. And so the title is intended to draw attention to the fact that a medium is not something neutral—it does something to people. It takes hold of them. It rubs them off, it massages them and bumps them around, chiropractically, as it were, and the general roughing up that any new society gets from a medium, especially a new medium, is what is intended in that title".
McLuhan argues that a "message" is, "the change of scale or pace or pattern" that a new invention or innovation "introduces into human affairs".
McLuhan understood "medium" as a medium of communication in the broadest sense. In "Understanding Media" he wrote: "The instance of the electric light may prove illuminating in this connection. The electric light is pure information. It is a medium without a message, as it were, unless it is used to spell out some verbal ad or name." The light bulb is a clear demonstration of the concept of "the medium is the message": a light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence". Likewise, the message of a newscast about a heinous crime may be less about the individual news story itself (the content), and more about the change in public attitude towards crime that the newscast engenders by the fact that such crimes are in effect being brought into the home to watch over dinner.
In "Understanding Media", McLuhan describes the "content" of a medium as a juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind. This means that people tend to focus on the obvious, which is the content, to provide us valuable information, but in the process, we largely miss the structural changes in our affairs that are introduced subtly, or over long periods of time. As society's values, norms, and ways of doing things change because of the technology, it is then we realize the social implications of the medium. These range from cultural or religious issues and historical precedents, through interplay with existing conditions, to the secondary or tertiary effects in a cascade of interactions that we are not aware of.
On the subject of art history, McLuhan interpreted Cubism as announcing clearly that the medium is the message. For him, Cubist art required "instant sensory awareness of the whole" rather than perspective alone. In other words, with Cubism one could not ask what the artwork was about (content), but rather consider it in its entirety. Many of the conceptions presented in this work are expansions, popularizations and applications of ideas initially conceived by Walter Benjamin and the dialog between his texts and other thinkers in the Frankfurt School in the 1930s and 1940s.
Applications.
Television.
Neil Postman in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves to Death" worried that McLuhan's theory, if true, meant that television was uniquely destructive to the public conversation in America, with style trumping substance.
Internet.
Some modern journalists and academics have pointed to algorithms, social media and the internet as great examples of McLuhan's theory.

Blanks 77

Blanks 77 is an American punk rock band active from 1990 to 2001, and again from 2004 onward. Originally based in Hillside, New Jersey, they have since relocated to Denville.
The band has maintained a prolific career, having released three albums and numerous EPs, appeared on numerous compilations, toured Europe twice, the U.S. countless times, and shared the stage with other well-known punk acts such as the Misfits, Rancid, Dwarves, the Business, Bad Brains, the Bouncing Souls, One Way System, Anti-Nowhere League, Anti-Heros, Dropkick Murphys, GBH, the Criminals, UK Subs, and Total Chaos.
History.
Formation, early years, first record (1990–1996).
The band formed in 1990 when high school friends Mike (vocals) and Chad (drums) were joined by guitarist Renee, whom they had met through a musician wanted ad. Their first bassist was a friend of Renee's named Brendan. The new group named themselves the Blanks after finding their minds blank as to what to name the band. Shortly thereafter, another band informed them that the Blanks name was already taken; to avoid conflict, they added '77 to their name in reference to punk rock's canonically accepted year of origin.
The original line-up remained until Brendan left in 1992. He was replaced by Geoff Kresge, who left the band after a six-month tenure to rejoin his band AFI. (Kresge would later go on to play in Tiger Army and HorrorPops.) He was replaced in Blanks 77 by Tim from the Broken Heroes, who began performing live with the band after a single rehearsal. The band recorded their first album, "Killer Blanks", which was released first in Germany on the Nasty Vinyl label in 1995, and in the U.S. a year later in 1996 on Radical Records with four extra tracks.
Further releases, lineup changes and breakup (1997–2001).
In 1997 Blanks 77 released a second album, "Tanked and Pogoed". Chad left the band in late 1997 and was replaced by Paul Russo from the Unseen, who filled in for two tours; the group ultimately settled on drummer Kid Lynch (formerly of Warzone and SFA). Their third full-length, "C.B.H.", was released in 1998.
After an ill-fated tour in 1999, the band began to dissolve, finally doing so in 2001 upon Renee's departure. Mike, Tim and Chad formed The S.D.A.B.s (Sex Drugs Alcohol Band), while Renee, Lynch and longtime roadie Dean Digaetano formed Dean Dean and the Sex Machines who released an LP. Renee also joined the long-standing founding street punk group U.S. Chaos, replacing her deceased brother in the band. Tim went on to play bass, and then later became the guitarist, for the New York hardcore punk band Murphy's Law, as well as continuing with the Broken Heroes.
Reformation (2004–present).
In 2004, Blanks 77 reunited around the "classic lineup" of Mike, Renee, Tim, and Chad. Although they ceased extensive touring, they remained active on the East Coast while playing occasional West Coast concerts. In 2015 Blanks 77 joined the Jailhouse Records label which released, "Gettin' Blasted", a ten-song split 12" release with fellow New Jersey band the Parasitix on April 29, 2016.

Giovanni Andrea Doria

Giovanni Andrea Doria (1539 – 1606), also known as Gianandrea Doria, was an Italian admiral from Genoa, the Marquis of Tursi and Prince of Melfi.
Biography.
Doria was born to a noble family of the Republic of Genoa. He was the son of Giannettino Doria, of the Doria family, who died when Doria was 6 years old. He would be selected by his great-uncle Andrea Doria to command the family's galleys.
He became the Admiral of the Genoese Fleet in 1555 and commanded the combined Christian fleet of the Holy League at the Battle of Djerba in 1560, which was won by the Ottoman Turks under the command of Piyale Pasha. He barely escaped with his life as his troops suffered a crushing defeat, the stress and shame supposedly caused the older Andrea Doria to die.
He also participated in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, commanding the right wing of the Christian coalition force known as the Holy League. During the battle he allowed a gap to be formed in the Holy League's battle line which was exploited by Occhiali. Many historians have criticized Doria for opening the line, some going so far as to describe it as an act of cowardice. The battle was ultimately won by the Holy League, and signaled the first defeat of the Ottoman Turks at sea since Preveza. Doria would go on to write reports attempting to justify his actions at the battle.
Using the momentum from the Battle of Lepanto, Don John and Doria would go on to capture Tunis in 1573.
He was defeated in the battle of the Strait of Gibraltar in 1591. Doria also organized an expedition against the Barbary states in 1601, which was ultimately aborted.
Doria was a knight commander of the Order of Santiago. He was also the Marquis of Tursi and 6th (or 2nd) Prince of Melfi (both titles inherited from his relation and adoptive father, the famed Genoese admiral Andrea Doria).
Marriages and children.
He married firstly in 1558 with Zenobia del Carretto (1540–1590) and had:
He married secondly and secretly in 1590 with Baroness Katharina of Lysfelt and Harem (1564–1606), natural and legitimate daughter of Eric II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

Exhumed of the Earth

Exhumed of the Earth is the debut album by Paramaecium. It was released in 1993. "Exhumed of the Earth" is considered to be one of the landmarks of both doom metal and Christian metal movements.
Recording history.
"Exhumed of the Earth" was recorded from 12 April to 1 May 1993 at Toybox Studios, Northcote, Melbourne, Australia. The band incorporated several classical instrument arrangements on the album, most notably on the 17 minute epic "The Unnatural Conception". Rosemary Sutton played violin and Judy Hellemons flute. Sutton also did the soprano vocals. The storyline of the album based on the Bible: it begins at the birth of Christ, continues through his resurrection, speaks of the disciples, and ends with Christians coming to life from the dead. Because the biblical references in the lyrics are elegantly written, the album has been often compared to old My Dying Bride. Musically, "Exhumed of the Earth" is mostly slow-paced doom metal with few death metal influences, most notably on the death growl vocals of Andrew Tompkins and on tracks like "Injudicial".
The record was produced by Paramaecium, engineered by Mark Tulk, and mixed by Paramaecium and Mark Tulk.
Paramaecium self-released "Exhumed of the Earth" in 1993 and later allowed several labels to distribute the album.
"HM Magazine" wrote that with the album Paramaecium "essentially delivered the most powerful and moving death/doom recording in the history of Christian metal."

<doc id="6900166" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6900166" title="Utility submeter">
Utility submeter

Utility sub-metering is a system that allows a landlord, property management firm, condominium association, homeowners association, or other multi-tenant property to bill tenants for individual measured utility usage. The approach makes use of individual water meters, gas meters, or electricity meters.
Sub-metering may also refer to the monitoring of the electrical consumption of individual equipment within a building, such as HVAC, indoor and outdoor lighting, refrigeration, kitchen equipment and more. In addition to the "main load" meter used by utilities to determine overall building consumption, submetering utilizes individual "submeters" that allow building and facility managers to have visibility into the energy use and performance of their equipment, creating opportunities for energy and capital expenditure savings.
Overview.
Typically a multi-tenant dwelling has either one master meter for the entire property or a meter for each building and the property is responsible for the entire utility bill. Submetering allows property owners who supply utilities to their tenants the ability to account for each tenant's usage in measurable terms. By fairly billing each tenant for their portion, submetering promotes conservation and offsets the expense of bills generated from a master meter, maintenance and improvements for well water systems, lagoon, or septic systems. Submetering is legally allowable in most states and municipalities, but owners should consult a Utility Management Vendor for assistance with local and state compliance and regulations.
Typical users of submetering are mobile home parks, apartments, condominiums, townhouses, student housing, and commercial areas. Usually, utility submetering is placed in situations where the local utility cannot or will not individually meter the utility in question. Municipal Utility companies are often reluctant to take on metering individual spaces for several reasons. One reason is that rental space tenants tend to be more transient and are more difficult to collect from. By billing only the owner, they can place liens on real property if not paid (as opposed to tenants they may not know exist or who have little to lose if they move without paying). Utilities also generally prefer not to have water meters beyond their easement (i.e., the property boundary), since leaks to a service line would be before the meter and could be of less concern to a property owner. Other reasons include difficulty in getting access to meters for reading, or electrical systems and plumbing not suitable for submetering.
Before submetering, many landlords either included the utility cost in the bulk price of the rent or lease, or divided the utility usage among the tenants in some way such as equally, by square footage via allocation methods often called RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing System) or some other means. Without a meter to measure individual usage, there is less incentive to identify building inefficiencies, since the other tenants or landlord may pay all or part of those costs. Submetering creates awareness of water and Energy conservation because landlords and tenants are equally aware of what they will pay for these inefficiencies if they are not attended to. Conservation also allows property owners to keep the cost of rent reasonable and fair for all units regardless of how much water or energy they consume.
On the other hand, submetering provides an opportunity for building owners to shift their rising electricity costs to tenants who lack ownership or control over thermal efficiency of the structure, its insulation, windows, and major energy consuming appliances. Landlords may attempt to deem their charges for electric service as "additional rent" making tenants subject to eviction for nonpayment of electric bills, which would not be possible if they were direct customers of the utility. The Ontario Energy Board in August 2009 nullified all landlord submetering and allowed future submetering only upon informed tenant consent, including provision of third party energy audits to tenants to enable them to judge the total cost of rent plus electricity.
Some submetering products connect with software that provides consumption data. This data provides users with the information to locate leaks and high-consumption areas. Users can apply this data to implement conservation or renovation projects to lower usage &amp; costs, meet government mandates, or participate in green building programs such as LEED and green globes.
System design.
A submetering system typically includes a "master meter", which is owned by the utility supplying the water, electricity, or gas, with overall usage billed directly to the property owner. The property owner or manager then places their own private meters on individual tenant spaces to determine individual usage levels and bill each tenant for their share. In some cases, the landlord might add the usage cost to the regular rent or lease bill. In other cases, a third party might read, bill, and possibly even collect for the service. Some of these companies also install and maintain meters and reading systems.
Panel or circuit submeters are used to measure resource use of the same system for added security, economic, reliability, and behavioral benefits. These provide important insights into resource consumption of building systems and equipment working in the same series. Submeters can measure use of a single panel, or multiple points within a panel system using single-point, multi-point, and branch circuit submeters.
The latest trend in submetering is Automatic Meter Reading, or AMR. This technology is used to get from meter reading to billing by an automated electronic means. This can be by handheld computers that collect data using touch wands, walk or drive-by radio, fixed network systems where the meter has a transmitter or transceiver that sends the data to a central location, or transmission via Wi-Fi, cellular, or Internet connections.
Although not technically submetering, an alternate method of utility cost allocation called RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing Systems) is sometimes used to allocate costs to tenants when true submetering is not practical or not possible due to plumbing or wiring constraints. This method divides utility costs by square footage, number of occupants, or some other combination of cost ratios.
Submetering in the world.
Submeters take many forms. For example, central heating in apartment blocks in Belgium, Germany and Switzerland is sometimes submetered with liquid filled calibrated vials, known as heat cost allocators, attached to each of the heating radiators. The metering company visits the apartments about once a year and reads the liquid level and replaces the vials. Some apartment owners have replaced the vials with electronic submeters that transmit temperature readings via radio to a master unit in each apartment. The master unit in turn transmits collated readings to the utility company, thereby saving both labour costs and inconvenience to both tenant and landlord. The master unit displays a number representing the current total of "heating value".
Submetering history and laws.
The concept of submetering was effectively "invented" sometime in the 1920s, when many laws currently affecting submetering were written. Submetering was not widespread until the energy crisis in the mid-1970s, which prompted an increase in submetering for gas and electric usage. Water submetering began its increase nationally in the mid-1990s when water and wastewater prices started rising. However, submetering really did not take a hold in the property management world until the late 1980s, with the ever increasing costs associated with utilities and a society more aware of environmental conservation.
Utility submetering has its roots in Denmark. In 1902 two Danish brothers, Axel and Odin Clorius, established Clorius Controls. The company commenced work on developing and producing a range of self-acting temperature controllers. In 1924 Clorius received its first patent for a heat cost allocator. The device was meant to measure energy usage in apartments built with a common boiler heating system. The device was attached to each radiator in an apartment unit. By measuring energy usage at each radiator, a consumption-based utility bill could be prepared for each unit.

I Lost It at the Movies

I Lost It at the Movies is a 1965 compendium of movie reviews written by Pauline Kael, later a film critic from "The New Yorker", from 1954 to 1965. The book was published prior to Kael's long stint at "The New Yorker"; as a result, the pieces in the book are culled from radio broadcasts that she did while she was at KPFA, as well as numerous periodicals, including "Moviegoer", the "Massachusetts Review", "Sight and Sound", "Film Culture", "Film Quarterly" and "Partisan Review". It contains her negative review of the then-widely acclaimed "West Side Story", glowing reviews of other movies such as "The Golden Coach" and "Seven Samurai", and longer polemical essays such as her largely negative critical responses to Siegfried Kracauer's "Theory of Film" and Andrew Sarris's "Film Culture" essay "Notes on the Auteur Theory, 1962". The book was a bestseller upon its first release and is now published by Marion Boyars Publishers.
Kael's first book is characterized by an approach in which she would often quote contemporary critics such as Bosley Crowther and Dwight Macdonald as a springboard to debunk their assertions while advancing her own ideas. This approach was later abandoned in her subsequent reviews, but is notably referred to in Macdonald's book "Dwight Macdonald On Movies" (1969).
When an interviewer asked her in later years as to what she had "lost", as indicated in the title, Kael averred, "There are so many kinds of innocence to be lost at the movies." It is the first of Kael's books titled with deliberately erotic connotations, typifying the sensual relation Kael perceived herself as having with the movies, as opposed to the theoretical bent that some among her colleagues had.
Contents.
The book is divided into an introduction and four sections. These sections are entitled as such: I) Broadsides; II) Retrospective Reviews: Movies Remembered with Pleasure; III) Broadcasts and Reviews, 1961–1963; and IV) Polemics.
The introduction is entitled "Zeitgeist and Poltergeist; Or, Are Movies Going to Pieces?"
The contents of Section One (Broadsides):
Movies reviewed in Section Two (Retrospective Reviews):
Movies reviewed and titles of articles in Section Three (Broadcasts and Reviews):
Contents of Section Four (Polemics):
Critical responses.
In "Dwight Macdonald On Movies", Macdonald includes a brief five-page review of "I Lost It at the Movies". While he states in the beginning of his review that he has, on the whole, favorable sentiments towards the book, he nevertheless criticizes Kael for being "stronger on the intellectual side than on the aesthetic side" as well as her persistence in quoting other critics out of context. In the process, Macdonald confutes some of the assertions Kael makes about his own opinions regarding certain movies.
Dwight Macdonald writes:
Nevertheless, Macdonald goes on to say that some of the quotes that Kael utilizes in her reviews are often used incorrectly especially in regards to him, creating a distorted view of the opinions he had on certain movies such as "Jules and Jim". He also questions the validity of some of her assessments of a few movies, including "Hiroshima Mon Amour", "8½", and "Last Year in Marienbad", stating that she is "perversely literal-minded" and comments upon "her ascetic insensibility to the sensual pleasures of cinema...when she dislikes the literary content." When Kael ponders in the book "it [is] difficult to understand why Dwight Macdonald with his dedication to high art sacrifices his time to them," Macdonald contends that he has always considered movies to be a high art. This, in a way, highlights the differences in their perspectives on movies: Pauline Kael sees movies as a fusion of pop and art elements (a mixture of lowbrow and highbrow), while Macdonald sees it in more highbrow terms. On the whole, Macdonald seems to respect her critical acumen, but not her methods.
A more adverse reaction comes from the auteurist Andrew Sarris, mainly as a result of the essay '"Circles and Squares", which was originally published in "Film Quarterly". Sarris's reaction was in response to Kael's denunciation of the Auteur theory's merits, and has, in later years, occasionally jabbed at Kael's work. Examples of his critical observations are available in his books, e.g., "The Primal Screen" and "Politics and Cinema". With the exception of "Circles and Squares", Kael has rarely responded. Notwithstanding Kael's unresponsive silence, this has gone down in film lore as the Sarris-Kael feud.
Further reading.
The book actually does not contain the full range of Kael's writings published in magazines from this period. From 1962–64, Kael had written for a short-lived section of "Film Quarterly" entitled Films of the Quarter, alongside other critics such as Stanley Kauffmann and the screenwriter Gavin Lambert. Some, but not all, of these writings are included in this book.
Miscellaneous.
In reference to the title of the book, the critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote an article entitled "I Missed It at the Movies: Objections to Raising "Kane"" as a rebuttal to Kael's essay on "Citizen Kane", which had been entitled "Raising Kane".
In "", the book is referenced under the parody title "I Lost Something at the Movies", and a short snippet of the made-up book is included, where the author theorizes (correctly) that the (fictional) film titled "Zombies in the Snow" awkward dialogue is actually written as such in order to pass on messages in a secret code. The name of the fictional author given, "Lena Pukalie", is also an anagram of Pauline Kael.

Pondok Indah Mall

Pondok Indah Mall (), abbreviated as PIM, is a large shopping mall complex located in the Pondok Indah suburb of South Jakarta, Indonesia. In January 2017, it was recognised by Forbes as one of the top five shopping malls in Jakarta. The Pondok Indah Mall complex comprises three large main buildings, the older 3-storey PIM1 and the 5-storey PIM2, and the newest building PIM3. PIM 1 and 2 are interconnected via two elevated multi-storey pedestrian walkways (North Skywalk and South Skywalk), which are also tenanted by specialty shops. PIM3, which was officially opened in 2021, is interconnected to the other two buildings by a walkway as well.
Each three main buildings (PIM 1, 2, and 3) have different tractions: PIM 1 provides a complete shopping concept with a supermarket on the ground floor and a vast food court, PIM 2 is more focused on upper-class aficionados with numbers of luxurious fashion and lifestyle brands, and PIM 3 becomes the balancer of the concept of both PIM 1 and 2. PIM 1 and 2 each house a cinema complex, both operated by Cinema XXI. There is also an open-air water theme park located adjacent with PIM1, right behind Street Gallery.
The Pondok Indah Mall complex has been further developed into a mixed-use development termed as the 'Pondok Indah City Center', which includes apartment towers, office towers, and the InterContinental Jakarta Pondok Indah Hotel &amp; Residences which is adjoined with PIM 2 and comprises approximately 300 hotel rooms and 180 serviced residences.
Architecture.
The architectural style was understated elegant conventional mall, with flooring continually updated until its present condition of polished Indonesian marble and granite. The architecture roughly imitated Dutch colonial large-scale warehouses with extensive steel-truss interpretation of Dutch structural timberwork for an innovative illuminating central skylight (double-glazed for minimizing heat transfer) and featured three airy floors of shopping with a narrow open-floor gallery (made safe via decorative fencing). The exterior featured aluminium cladding for minimal maintenance in the harsh tropical climate.
Pondok Indah Mall 1.
PIM 1 was completed in 1991. Originally, the site was a mixture of open fields, kampong, middle-class dwellings and traditional warungs and eateries. Metro Department Store opened its first store at PIM 1, alongside fellow anchor tenants Hero Supermarket, Muji, and Cinema XXI. It also houses a Uniqlo store, along with PIM 3.
Street Gallery.
PIM 1's new extension, Street Gallery opened in 2013. It is located south of the PIM1 side. It mainly consists of food and beverage tenants.
Pondok Indah Mall 2.
PIM 2 was first advertised as an ambitious huge amalgamation of residential and hotel-apartment tower complexes (one tower for each), office space, and commercial hub. However, due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, funds were unavailable to proceed. After a change of ownership, the expansion was finally realized in 2004 with the opening of Mall 2. At PIM2, Sogo unveiled its latest supermarket format, dubbed "Sogo Foodhall" in 2004. In 2023, Don Don Donki opened its fourth store here.
Pondok Indah Mall 3.
PIM 3 was developed in the second half of 2016, after the success of closing the roof of Pondok Indah Residences. It was designed with a leasable area of over 55,000 square metres, and was officially opened on 8 April 2021. A key architectural feature is the giant balcony with a glass floor that shows the bottom two floors called Atmost-Fear. Seibu, Ranch Market, and Uniqlo are the anchor tenants. PIM 3 has a convention hall called the "City Hall" on the top floor, which becomes the venue of the Jakarta Fashion Week since 2022. Above the connection bridge between PIM 3 and 2, there is an open-air public space and a small flower garden called "Love on Top" (LoT).

Minneapolis Armory

The Minneapolis Armory is a historic event center and former National Guard armory located in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. Built by the Public Works Administration in 1936, the building was occupied by several Army and Naval Militia units of the Minnesota National Guard from its opening until 1985. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
In addition to its military use, the armory hosted sporting events, political conventions, and music concerts. It was the home arena of the Minneapolis Lakers of the NBA (now the Los Angeles Lakers) during the 1959–1960 season and part-time home from 1947 through 1959. The armory held 8,000 people for basketball. Later used as a parking facility, the armory underwent renovations and was turned into an 8,400-person events center and concert venue. Since its reopening in 2018, it has hosted numerous musical performances, including during the weekend of Super Bowl LII.
History.
The armory was the costliest single building in Minnesota supported by a Public Works Administration grant. The building is an example of the PWA Moderne style, a design characterized by strong geometry, bold contouring and integrated sculpture ornamentation. The building was designed by St. Paul architect P.C. Bettenburg, who was also a major in the Minnesota National Guard. St. Paul artist Elsa Jemne painted murals in the building.
From the late 1930s through the 1970s, in addition to serving as an armory for Minnesota National Guard units based in Minneapolis, it was a venue for civic events, including concerts, political conventions and sporting events such as Golden Gloves tournaments. The building was used by the Minneapolis Lakers of the National Basketball Association as a part-time home between 1947 and 1959, and as its primary home court for the 1959–60 NBA season. 
Professional motorcycle racing took place inside the Armory during the winter months from 1968 through 1980. The Minnesota National Guard was still operating at the armory as late as 1985.
Hennepin County bought the armory in 1989 for $4.7 million, with plans to demolish it and place a new county jail on the site. The Minnesota Historical Society sued to stop its destruction and in 1993, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that the structure was protected by state law, and could not be torn down because of its historical status. In 1998, the county sold the building for $2.6 million to a private company for use as a parking structure on condition that it be preserved.
In 2015, the Armory was purchased by a local development firm for $6 million. The building was converted from a parking facility to an 8,400-capacity events center and concert venue. It reopened in January 2018 in time to host several events related to Super Bowl LII.
The building was designated a Minneapolis historic landmark in 2017.
The venue hosted NXT Deadline in December 2024.
Concerts.
Minneapolis Armory has hosted numerous concerts with bands such as Arctic Monkeys, Deadmau5, Dua Lipa, Falling in Reverse, Halsey, Judas Priest, Huddy, Motionless in White, Megadeth, Machine Gun Kelly, Pink and Weezer.
Prince used the Armory to film his music video "1999" from the eponymous album in 1982.

Zaven Kouyoumdjian

Zaven Kouyoumdjian (; ) is a Lebanese talk show host, producer and television personality of both Armenian and Arab descent. Better Known with his stage name "Zaven", he is considered the pioneer of social talk on Arab Television. Zaven is also a media researcher and author of six books, including Lebanon's best-seller "Lebanon Shot Twice".
Currently, Zaven hosts "Sire Wkamalit" on AlJadeed . Launched in January 2025, the show promises to bring back serious journalistic content to the Lebanese social talk show genre, distancing itself from sensationalism and fleeting trends. Simultaneously, Zaven hosts and produces the morning show "Bonjouren" on Sawt Kel Lebnan Radio and leads two podcasts "Count to Ten" in collaboration with GIZ and "100/100 The Full Grade" with LAU as part of its centennial commemorations.
Before that Zaven was the face of The "Munathara Initiative’s" Sho Awlak. This debate show (2022 – 2024) brought together key national broadcasters to commit to public interest journalism.
Zaven is married to Laury Haytayan and has two sons born in 2003 and 2007.
Early years.
Zaven was born in Beirut on May 15, 1970 to Ardashes Kouyoumdjian and Souad Kaadi. He received his primary and secondary education at the AGBU's Demerjian School and the Armenian Evangelical College in Beirut.
Education.
Zaven holds a master's degree in Communication Arts, a discipline concerned with advertising and media, from the Notre Dame University (NDU) in Zouk Mosbeh, Lebanon. He earned his bachelor's degree in Communication Arts from the Lebanese American University in Beirut.
Career.
In 1992, he joined Télé Liban as a news reporter and late-night news anchor. Soon afterwards, he became Télé Liban’s face for news through its promotional campaign "Aban An Jad", by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi . In 1994, he was assigned to be TL's news correspondent at the Presidential Palace in Baabda. He started his first weekly talk show, "5/7" in 1995, and his investigative journalism made him a household name in Lebanon. Within the show's first year, Zaven was making headlines through the controversial issues he investigated, such as the toxic wastes scandal, the Israeli kidnapping of Mustafa Dirani, and the ban of the Lebanese Forces."5/7" became Télé Liban's longest-running talk show in the 1990s, scoring the highest rating for a single talk show episode in 1996.
During his coverage of the Israeli Operation Grapes of Wrath offensive on South Lebanon in 1996, Zaven rose to prominence as he brought the horrifying footage of the Israeli massacres at the Qana and Mansouri villages to global attention.
In 1999, and during the Syrian occupation of Lebanon, the pro-Syrian government under Selim Hoss banned 5/7 from airing on Télé Liban. Zaven shaved his head as an expression of protest.
Seven months later, Zaven moved to Future Television, a television broadcasting network owned by former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. He started his own show, "Siré Wenfatahit", which quickly became the highest-rated talk show in the Middle East, according to Pan-Arab IPTV network Talfazat-ART. In 2004, Zaven convinced four HIV-positive individuals to appear on his show about life after AIDS and discrimination. This was the first time that HIV-positive individuals appeared on any Arab channel without covering their faces. Also in 2004, he published his first book, "Lebanon Shot Twice". Inspired by Oprah Winfrey, he launched the first Arab television book club, the Nisrine Jaber Book Club.
Zaven often opened his show as a platform for political and social activism. "An episode of talk show Sireh w’infatahit aired by Future TV on December 19th 2005 had the presenter Zaven Kouyoumdjian offer to bring members of the opposition and Hizbolla to the studio to air their views and reach a common ground".
In 2005, Zaven was named by Newsweek magazine in 2005 as one of the 43 most influential people in the Middle East.
Zaven launched a new series, called "Ana Ala'an" (meaning Me Now) in 2006. The series aimed at giving the chance for Arab youth to express their thoughts and feelings on TV using their personal camera. This series is credited to be the first recognition of emerging online media and the power of youth to achieve change. Zaven ended his 13-year-long show "Sire Wenfatahit" on July 15, 2012, in a special series of countdown episodes.
In August 2012, Zaven kicked off his show "AalAkid" on Future TV, a collaboration with director Bassem Christo and French producer Péri Cochin through their production house "Periba". The show was a Lebanese adaptation of the popular French show Sans aucun doute, presented by Julien Courbet daily on TMC. "AalAkid" was received by critics and viewers with enthusiasm, as it reshaped the Lebanese social talk show experience and established new foundations for conflict resolution through media. The show gained quick appreciation as a new style in addressing social issues on Lebanese television.
In 2012, Zaven signed his second book with Dr Dolly Habbal, "Witness on Society" in Beirut Book fair. (Publishers: Academia).
In October 2014, Zaven launched his talk show "Bala Toul Sire" that continues his run on Future Television, with episodes about life, society and people in the form of a live weekly magazine, covering different topics stemming from current headlines or the unreported margins.
In September 2019, shortly before celebrating his 20th anniversary at Future TV, the station ceased all its production operations due to financial losses, and thus Zaven’s show Bala Toul Sire was terminated. The last episode of the show was broadcast on August 9, 2019, and it featured the creator of Yamli, Habib Haddad.
Following Beirut blast in 2020, Zaven hosted the morning show of Lebanon’s leading Sawt Kl Lebnan Radio station. The show continues to voice its listeners’ agonies and concerns in the midst of the county’s ongoing economic and political crisis.
In 2021, Zaven hosted Nafas Jdeed (New Spirit), an online political talk show that gives emerging and young political activists an independent and friendly platform. The show is initiated and produced by DRI – a berlin based international NGO.
In November 2021, Zaven joined The Munathara Initiative as the host for their Lebanese version of Townhall, a debate talkshow that brings together key national broadcasters to commit to public interest journalism. The show aims to promote constructive public discourse across the Arabic-speaking region.
In 2022, Zaven hosted Assaha (The Square), an online political show produced by Spectrum Politix in collaboration with the Samir Kassir Foundation.
In 2023, he hosted Munathara initiative’s weekly debate show Sho Awlak (What's Your Say). The one of a kind multi-channel show gave voice to youth and promoted debate culture in Lebanon. Same year, Zaven launched 3ed Lal 3ashra show (Count To Ten) on his YouTube Channel zavenonline in collaboration with GIZ.
In 2024, Zaven hosted GEN Z talk show on Halalondon satellite channel, and 100/100 The Final Grade podcast on the occasion of LAU's centennial.

Warren Bradley (footballer)

Warren Bradley (20 June 1933 – 6 June 2007) was an English footballer who played for Manchester United and England.
Bradley was born in Hyde, Cheshire, and educated at Hyde Grammar School, where he played for Bolton Wanderers youth and B teams for eight years. He then attended Hatfield College at the University of Durham, and appeared for Durham City before joining Northern League side Bishop Auckland, one of the leading amateur clubs in the country, in 1955.
In February 1958, many of the players and staff of Manchester United were killed or injured in the Munich air disaster. To fulfil their immediate fixture commitments, they needed to find several good players at short notice, and turned to Bishop Auckland for help. Three England amateur internationals, including Bradley, were loaned to United's reserve team while the club tried to rebuild. After a few months, having recovered from his injuries received in the crash, United's manager Matt Busby returned to work and was impressed by Bradley. He was signed as a part-time professional in November 1958, taking a job as a teacher in Stretford, and made his first-team debut for United against his old club, Bolton Wanderers.
In May 1959, Bradley was selected by England manager Walter Winterbottom, and became the first and only player to play for both the professional and amateur England teams in the same season. He played just three games for the full England team, including a tour of Mexico and the United States, and scored twice. However, his career at Manchester United never progressed any further, and he was transferred to Bury in 1962 for £2,500. He left Bury after a couple of seasons, and after brief spells with Northwich Victoria, Macclesfield Town and Bangor City, he retired in 1966.
After his retirement from football he had a long career as a headteacher, latterly at Deane School in Bolton, and worked with the Manchester United ex-players association.

Hayashio-class submarine

The "Hayashio"-class submarine was the successor to the , and the predecessor of the within the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Ordered in 1959, the boats were small with limited capabilities but were successful. Constructed in Japan from 1960 to 1962, they remained in service until 1979 when they were decommissioned.
Design and description.
The "Hayashio" class was based on the United States Navy "Barracuda"-class submarines. They were small with limited capability and were shorter and wider than the preceding Japanese . The main mission of the class was for operations in coastal waters. They were air conditioned and provided quality habitability for their crews and were considered a successful submarine design. They measured long overall with a beam of and a draft of . They had a surfaced displacement of and submerged. Part of the design was to reduce hull resistance and to do this, external framing was used to improve internal space and create a better double hull. They had a crew of 43.
The submarines were propelled by two propeller shafts powered by a diesel-electric system composed of two Sulzer-Mitsubishi diesel engines creating and two electric motors creating . The main storage batteries were water-cooled. This gave the vessels a maximum speed of surfaced and submerged. To improve underwater maneuverability, a joystick was installed instead of the traditional wheel at the helm position. The submarines mounted three torpedo tubes in the bow for torpedoes. The class used a water pressure system to launch torpedoes that eliminated the creation of water bubbles.
Construction and career.
Both submarines were ordered in 1959 from Japanese shipyards. Both "Hayashio" and "Wakashio" entered service in 1962. On 20 May 1970, "Hayashio" collided with a merchant vessel damaging the submarine's periscope. They were both stricken from the naval vessel register in 1979, with "Wakashio" on 23 July 1979.

Heartland Corridor

The Heartland Corridor is a public-private partnership between the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) and the Federal Highway Administration and three U.S. states to improve railroad freight operations. 
The $150 million plan was developed to facilitate more efficient travel on NS rail lines between the Norfolk, Virginia port region and two Midwest destinations—Chicago, Illinois and Columbus, Ohio. One of the project goals was to increase clearances in tunnels to permit the operation of double-stack intermodal trains, increasing the capacity of rail lines, shortening rail journeys and reducing tractor-trailer traffic. New shipping terminals for intermodal connections are also planned for key locations.
Construction began in 2007, and the route opened for double stack service on September 9, 2010.
The project involved raising clearances in 28 tunnels and 24 other overhead obstacles. A total of around of tunnels were modified. When completed, the new routing was expected to reduce travel times from port facilities in Virginia to Chicago to three days, improving on the previous four-day travel time and to reduce the distance traveled by .
In June 2010, NS announced that it had reached an agreement with Ohio to extend a leg of the Heartland Corridor southwesterly from Columbus to Cincinnati, which is located on the Ohio River near the border where Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana converge. The $6.1 million cost will be funded with federal economic stimulus funds and the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council of Governments, plus money from NS.

No-Big-Silence

No-Big-Silence (often abbreviated as "NBS"), originally known as Aggressor, is an Industrial metal/rock band from Estonia.
History.
Early years as Aggressor (1989–1995).
The beginnings of Aggressor date back to 1989 when Villem Tarvas, Marek Piliste, Kristo Kotkas and Marko Atso started playing together as an unnamed band. At the start of 1990 they released their first demo album named "Indestructible" – the music on this recording was influenced by German thrash metal band Kreator. Their first big performance was on 17 April 1990, and a year later they put together a 4 track demo which resulted in the recording of their first album, "Procreate the Petrifactions" at the end of 1992. Later on they played several shows in Moscow and in 1994 they released their second album "Of Long Duration Anguish". The band was first introduced to a wider audience in the summer of 1995 at the Rock Summer festival in Estonia, where Aggressor headlined the B-stage – the crowd gave them a warm welcome.
Change of style and renaming to No-Big-Silence (1995–1996).
In 1994 bass guitarist Cram (Marek Piliste) sung a cover version of Corrosia Metalla's "Russian Vodka" for the album "Of Long Duration Anguish". This later resulted in the idea of changing the band's name and style.
In 1995 the band went to studio (still as Aggressor) and were suggested a name-change. In 1995 they wrote lyrics to a song titled "No-Big-Silence 99" (a street in the USA where a mass murder was committed) – so the album was titled "99" and band renamed to "No-Big-Silence".
Success (1996–present).
After the 1995 Rock Summer festival, No-Big-Silence has successfully performed at larger festivals as well as at smaller clubs in Estonia, the Baltic States, Russia and Scandinavia. No-Big-Silence is valued as a live-act with an impressive show, esteemed by world class bands such as Metallica, Iron Maiden, Rammstein, HIM, Motörhead, Waltari, etc., who have chosen NBS to be their supporting act.
The chairman of the concert agency Baltic Development Group, Peeter Rebane, the local promoter for Metallica, Iron Maiden and Rammstein, comments: "In our opinion, No-Big-Silence is the most professional industrial band in the Baltics. Besides, they are a great live-act."
Their second release "Successful, Bitch &amp; Beautiful" was already the album of current hit-songs such as "On the Hunt" and "Vamp-o-Drama". In 2001 the album was sold in Scandinavia, Germany, Italy and other European countries through the Finnish label Cyberware Productions. The homepage of Cyberware states that this album of No-Big-Silence is a magnificent masterpiece and regards it as one of the label's strongest releases today. According to Cyberware, the bonus video "Star DeLuxe" on the western version of the album gives a good overview of the band's glamorous live-show and enthusiastic fanbase. The Scandinavian music magazine "Prospective Magazine" thinks that "Successful, Bitch &amp; Beautiful" is a "must listen to"-album. The review in the same magazines gives No-Big-Silence 8 out of 10 points. Johan Carlsson, a reviewer for the Swedish "Release Magazine" distinguishes the even and uniform quality of the album. "Metal riffs melded with electronic sounds on top of rock song structures make an interesting mixture, and the vocals fit perfectly." He continues: "It is nice to see an Estonian band, but don't buy it because of that. Buy it because it is good."
Musical style.
The music of NBS has been variously described as sounding like Marilyn Manson and at times even Rammstein or Nine Inch Nails.
The band's style saw changes throughout their albums apart from their first two, "Procreate the Petrifactions" and "Of Long Duration Anguish", which are death metal. "99", recorded in 1995, featured a more thrash metal sound, but at the time of the album's release the band had taken on an industrial sound which was reflected in the supposed following album "new race" which was never released until 2003 under the compilation title "Unreleased".
"Successful, Bitch &amp; Beautiful" can be considered their softest album as it contains a mix of metal, rock and electronic. "Unreleased" is their heaviest and most electronic album and "War in Wonderland" is one of the darker and most "metal" of the band's albums.
"Starstealer", released in 2009, shows the band turning darker and heavier. The artwork of the album shows a darker side of the band and the music bears much darker sound and a hint of thrash metal from the old days. 
"No-Big-Silence, unlike most of the hard rock bands, that get their inspiration from mysticism, concentrates on expressing the twists and turns of human psychology in the language of pop music. It is a great achievement in itself – to sound tough and delicate at the same time."

Baussenque Wars

The Baussenque Wars (from French "Guerres Baussenques", meaning "wars of Baux") were a series of armed conflicts (1144–1162) between the House of Barcelona, then ruling in Provence, and the House of Baux. They are held up in Provence as the idealistic resistance by one of her native families against Catalan "occupation." In reality, they were the first of many successful expansions of Catalan power and influence in the Mediterranean world.
Causes.
Three major factors played into the eruption of this conflict: the competition between the counts of Toulouse and those of Barcelona for influence in the region of Provence, the succession crisis of the first ruling dynasty of the county of Provence, and the ambitions of the Baux family.
Due to a lack of success in the "Reconquista" on their southern frontier, the Catalans turned towards the Mediterranean littoral and northwards. They coveted the region between the Cévennes and the Rhône, then under the control of Toulouse. In 1112, the count of Barcelona, Ramon Berenguer III, married the heiress of Provence, Douce, who was the daughter of Countess Gerberga of Provence, Gévaudan, Carlat, and part of Rodez. The marriage was probably taken at the urging of the church, which was then in conflict with house of Toulouse. In 1076, its count, Raymond IV, was excommunicated but he still lent his support to Aicard, the deposed archbishop of Arles (since 1080). With the count away on the First Crusade, the church took the opportunity to seize the balance of power in the region. This marriage effectively put Provence under Catalan control.
In 1125, Raymond's heir, Alfonso Jordan, signed a treaty that recognized his family's traditional claim to the title of "Margrave of Provence" and defined the march of Provence as the region north of the lower Durance and on the right of the Rhône, including the castles of Beaucaire, Vallabrègues, and Argence. The region between the Durance, the Rhône, the Alps, and the sea was that of the county and belonged to the house of Barcelona. Avignon, Pont de Sorgues, Caumont, and Le Thor remained undivided.
Internally, Provence was racked by uncertainties over the rights of succession. Douce and Ramon Berenguer signed all charters jointly until her death in 1127, after which he alone appears as count in all charters until his death in 1131. At that time, Douce's younger sister Stephanie was married to Raymond of Baux, who promptly laid claim to the inheritance of her mother, even though Provence had peacefully passed into the hands of her nephew, Berenguer Ramon I.
Opening moves.
As a result of these crises, "le Midi" was divided into two factions. Berenguer Ramon was supported by his elder brother, Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona, and the viscounts of Carcassonne, Béziers and Nîmes. The other supporters of Stephanie and Raymond included Toulouse, the county of Foix, Arles (until 1150), and even the Republic of Genoa, who carried out an attack on Melgueil in 1144 during which Berenguer Ramon died. He was succeeded in his claim by his young son Ramon Berenguer II.
According to the historian and Arles-native Louis Mathieu Anibert, his city appointed a consulate to prepare for war (1131):
At the opening of the conflict, Raymond of Baux made an appeal to Conrad III, who was technically the King of Burgundy, though this title meant more in theory than in practice, Provence being legally a fief of the Burgundian kingdom. Raymond begged for his sovereign's recognition of the rights of Stephanie as heir to the possessions of Gerberga. By an act of 4 August 1145, Conrad validated the right of Stephanie and Raymond to their titles and granted them the power of coining money at Arles and at Trinquetaille. The latter was a great aid to their aspirations.
War.
The conflict itself, which had been ongoing since the succession of Berenguer Ramon, accelerated after his death. The rest of the war can be seen as three successive armed conflicts. The first began in 1144, with Berenguer Ramon's war with Genoa, and continued until an accord was signed in 1150. The second lasted a short while (1155 – 1156). The third and final war was most short-lived, lasting less than a year. It saw the house of Barcelona victorious in permanently laying to rest the claims of the House of Baux in spite of the latter having enjoyed the royal approval of Conrad and subsequently of his nephew.
Despite Conrad's proclamation, the war gained pace in 1147, generally in favour of Barcelona, for the count of Toulouse was away on the Second Crusade. In view of his impotence, with only the backing of Arles, Raymond of Baux entered into negotiations and made submission to the house of Barcelona. He left for Spain, where he died before the peace could be concluded. Stephanie's four sons — Hugh, William, Bertrand, and Gilbert — were recompensed for relinquishing their rights to the counties of Gerberga and a treaty was signed at Arles in 1150.
The truce did not last and Stephanie and her sons renewed the conflict in 1155 in alliance with the count of Toulouse. Hugh achieved a diplomatic victory with his confirmation by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, but like that of Conrad years earlier, it meant nothing to the Catalans. This second war, too, did not go well for the house of Baux. In 1156, they were forced to relinquish the castle of Castillon and other fortified places. They did retain Baux itself and its outer defences, like the castle of Trinquetaille.
In August 1161, Ramon Berenguer travelled to Turin with his uncle, the count of Barcelona, to obtain the confirmation of his countship in Provence from the emperor. There he met Richeza of Poland, the daughter of the exiled Polish high duke, Ladislaus II. He married her on 17 November and on the return journey, his uncle died. In 1162, open war erupted again. Baux was razed and its environs ravaged. Ramon Berenguer was recognised as victor by the chancelleries of the Empire, but Hugh made a last attempt to salvage victory by reminding the emperor of the two chrysobull-attended letters issued on his behalf, one of Conrad the other of Frederick himself. Barbarossa wisely kept silent about his reasons for a change of heart.
In 1166, Ramon Berenguer renewed the war with Genoa which his father had waged. He died besieging Nice in that year.

County of Provence

The County of Provence was a largely autonomous medieval state that eventually became incorporated into the Kingdom of France in 1481. For four centuries Provence was ruled by a series of counts that were vassals of the Carolingian Empire, Burgundy and finally the Holy Roman Empire, but in practice they were largely independent.
Summary.
The County of Provence (in Old Occitan, "Comtat de Provensa") was a former fief east of the Rhône delta. A territory that emerged from Middle Francia, Provence was first organized as a kingdom before gradually disintegrating due to feudal transfers and the civil war of the Union of Aix. Its natural borders originally stretched south from the Rhône to Nice and north from Embrun to the Vivarais, passing through the . To the north, its boundaries extended as far as Valence.
The county was annexed to France in 1487, and the king assumed the title "Count of Provence, , and adjacent lands," while appointing Palamède de Forbin as Grand Seneschal, Governor, and Lieutenant General of Provence. Provence retained its privileges, franchises, and freedoms.
In terms of taxation, Provence was a "pays de taille réelle" (a land-tax-paying region); the don gratuit, the principal direct tax, was levied on property, except “noble property.” Regarding the salt tax (gabelle), Provence was a "pays de petite gabelle" (small salt-tax region); salt was sold through five salt warehouses (in Berre, Toulon, Hyères, Fréjus, and Cannes), along with additional storage depots.
The political structure of the County was reformed into departments in 1790, with legislative institutions transferred to the new capital, Paris. These events triggered federalist movements, which were repressed by the Convention’s centralist armies. During this time, Toulon and Marseille were renamed Port-la-Montagne and La Ville-sans-nom (“The City Without a Name”), respectively.
Toponymy.
The term “County of Provence” is attested as early as 1059. It derives from the title “Count of Provence,” which had been recorded since 972 and became more commonly used from the 1020s–1030s onward.
Provence owes its name to Roman times: it was the first region of Transalpine Gaul conquered between 58 and 51 BCE, and it became part of the Roman province ("Provincia" in Latin), with Narbonne as its capital—thus the name Gallia Narbonensis. The Latin "Provincia" gave rise to the Provençal form "Proensa", which evolved into "Provensa", then "Prouvença" (in Provençal dictionary), and eventually Prouvenço under French influence in Provençal orthography. The spelling "Prouvènço" was standardized by followers of Roumanille and the phonetic writing system known as mistralian or “modern.” Classicists later proposed returning to a more original form, "Provensa", which appeared on several early 20th-century maps. However, the medieval form "Provença" was chosen, as it included the letter ç representing the etymological c of provincia. In "The Gallic Wars", Caesar mentions passing from "Provincia to Narbonnensis" when crossing the Rhône, which likely explains why only the part of former Narbonese Gaul east of the Rhône came to be known as Provence.
Geography.
Borders.
Historically, after the fall of the Roman Empire, “Provence” referred to the territory incorporated into the Frankish Kingdom in 536 and which became the Marquisate of Provence under the Kingdom of Burgundy-Provence in 947. It later became the County of Provence, with Arles, then Aix-en-Provence as its capitals (Arles suffering frequent attacks from the Count of Toulouse, Marquis of Provence). The borders fluctuated: in 1125, a treaty between Raymond Berenger and Alphonse Jourdain of Toulouse divided Provence. The County of Provence was tied to the Crown of Aragon until the Treaty of Meaux-Paris (1229). In 1388, after Queen Joanna’s death, her territories east of the Var were lost and ceded to the States of Savoy in what became known as the , initially forming the Terres Neuves de Provence and later the County of Nice from 1526. A century later, in 1481, the County of Provence passed by succession to King Louis XI of France and thus became a French province.
In the Middle Ages, Provence included the southern Alps up to the left-bank tributaries of the Var. Parts of the Alpine regions were later separated: in the north, incorporated into the Dauphiné province, and in the east, the Pays Niçois (County of Nice) was granted to the House of Savoy in 1388 under the name "Terres Neuves de Provence". This Savoyard acquisition, at Provence’s expense, led to the creation of the County of Nice from 1526 to 1860.
During the French Revolution, Provence was divided into three departments: Basses-Alpes (renamed Alpes-de-Haute-Provence in 1970), Bouches-du-Rhône, and Var. The department of Vaucluse was created in 1793 from Avignon, the Comtat Venaissin, and the northern part of Bouches-du-Rhône. The Alpes-Maritimes were created in 1860 from the County of Nice and the eastern part of Var (Grasse district).
The southern part of Drôme, though historically part of the Dauphiné, is known as Drôme provençale. It is culturally close to Provence due to language, the fact that the bishopric of Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux belonged to the metropolitan province of Provence (Archbishopric of Arles), the region of Bouchet was part of the Comtat Venaissin (Upper Comtat), and because Diois and Valentinois were vassals of the Marquis of Provence.
Over time, some authentically Provençal enclaves persisted in southern Drôme provençale, such as the County of Grignan (including the neighboring villages of Réauville, Montjoyer, Salles, Colonzelle, Allan), the Provençal enclave of Lemps (written Lens in the 18th century), and the enclaves of Saint-May, Rémuzat, Cornillon, Pommerol, and Eygalayes. All these villages identify with Provence and have legitimate historical claims to that heritage.
Relief.
The relief of Provence is generally hilly, with impressive Prealps in the central part and, to the east and northeast, the Southern Alps, which reach their highest point at 3,412 meters at the Aiguille de Chambeyron (Alpes-de-Haute-Provence). Further south lies the Pelat massif, rising to 3,050 meters. On either side of the Var River, as well as east of the Verdon River, the Castellane Prealps, which peak at at 1,996 meters, are composed of plateaus and mountain ranges oriented west to east. The High Provence Plains (Plans de Haute-Provence) separate the Prealps from the central hills (, Canjuers Plain, ). To the west, the Mont Ventoux massif, mostly located in the Comtat Venaissin, extends into Provence, where it reaches an altitude of 1,600 meters in the Sault National Forest. The Sainte-Victoire Mountain, famous for Cézanne’s paintings, dominates the Aix region (Pays d’Aix). In the Bouches-du-Rhône department, the Alpilles are notable, while in Vaucluse, at the edge of the Comtat Venaissin, stands the Petit Luberon, Provençal in its eastern part, followed by the Grand Luberon, which reaches its highest point at . Lastly, the Sainte-Baume massif stretches from west to east, from Gémenos (Bouches-du-Rhône) to Mazaugues (Var).
The coastlines from Marseille to Menton are rather rugged (Calanques, Maures, Esterel, French Riviera). Erosion caused by violent summer storms can create deeply carved ravines.
The western part of the region is marked by the Crau Plain and the Camargue, formed by the Rhône Delta, which are the only truly flat areas in the Provençal region.
Hydrography.
Among the waterways that cross Provence, the most significant is the Rhône, which forms the western border of the region. The Rhône has the second-largest flow rate of all rivers flowing into the Mediterranean Sea, after the Nile. As it flows into a tide-less sea, the river has formed a delta. Now embanked, this delta remains stable except during exceptional floods such as those in 1993, 1994, and 2003.
The Durance is a tributary of the Rhône, with its source at approximately 2,390 meters above sea level, at the Pré de Gondran, on the slopes of the . The source lies near the former Gondran Fort, in the commune of Montgenèvre, in the Hautes-Alpes, near the Italian border. It flows into the Rhône a few kilometers southwest of Avignon, between the Vaucluse and Bouches-du-Rhône departments, serving as a border between the two. The Durance is known as a “capricious” river, once feared for both its floods (Provençal tradition says the three plagues of Provence were the mistral wind, the Durance, and the Parliament of Aix) and its low-water periods.
The Ubaye is a river that originates at the at an altitude of 2,655 meters, in the Ubaye Valley. It passes through Barcelonnette (a sub-prefecture of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence) and feeds into the Durance in the Serre-Ponçon hydroelectric reservoir.
The Verdon River, which rises at the foot of the (altitude 2,572 meters), flows into the Durance after covering approximately 175 kilometers. It is especially renowned for its gorges.Many coastal rivers also exist in Provence, notably:
Climate.
Provence is a region with a Mediterranean climate, featuring hot, dry summers. Winters are mild along the coast and generally humid in the east but are harsher in the north and northeast (Pelat, Ubaye, Digne Prealps), where the climate becomes alpine.
In its central and Mediterranean areas, the vegetation of Provence is characteristic of the garrigue (scrubland), and the summer drought makes it particularly vulnerable to wildfires. However, the region becomes greener and more humid in its more easterly and alpine parts.
The main wind is the mistral, whose speed can exceed 110 km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year, with gusts averaging 90 km/h. The following table (not included here) indicates the various mistral wind speeds recorded at the Orange and Carpentras-Serres stations in the southern Rhône Valley and its frequency during the year 2006. The "normal" corresponds to the average of the past 53 years for Orange’s meteorological records and 42 years for those of Carpentras.
History.
Antiquity.
Greek provence.
The Provençal coastline was colonized by the Greeks: around 600 BCE, the Phocaeans settled in Marseille ("Massalia" in Greek; "Massilia" in Latin). They spread out to other areas, founding colonies in Nice (Nikaia), Antibes (Antipolis), Hyères (Olbia), Six-Fours (Tauroeis), Arles, La Ciotat (Citharista), Brégançon (Pergantion), Monaco (Monoïkos), Athénopolis, and on certain parts of the Languedoc coast such as Agde (Agathé) and south of Nîmes. To the north, they founded Le Pègue near Valréas and stopped at La Laupie, east of Montélimar. Before the Roman invasion and colonization, the region was mainly inhabited by Ligurians, who later mixed with some Celtic soldiers and founded what is now referred to as the Celto-Ligurians (formerly Celto-Lygians).

Brief timeline
Middle Ages.
Early Middle Ages.
The lower Rhône Valley experienced various invasions. The Visigoths and Alans plundered many cities and reached as far as Orange and Avignon. The Burgundians settled in the region in 442 and chose Vienne, which retained its prestige as a great Roman city, as their capital. Avignon marked the southernmost point of this kingdom. However, in 484, upon the death of the Visigoth king Euric, the Burgundians crossed the Durance and seized all of Provence, which they returned to the Visigoths in 501. In 508, the Ostrogoths in turn seized Provence and established a duchy in the south of the Burgundian kingdom, dependent on their Italo-Dalmatian realm: the Duchy of Provence, which would later become Lower Provence or the County of Provence (the Burgundian part would become the Margraviate of Provence). In 536, the Franks took possession of the duchy, partially integrating it into the Frankish kingdom of Burgundy. Charles Martel fought against the patrician of Provence, Maurontus, an ally of the Moors of Gothia, and permanently brought Provence into the Frankish domain in 736.
In 843, the Treaty of Verdun granted Provence to Lothair I. His son, Charles of Provence, made it the Kingdom of Provence-Viennois or Lower Burgundy, a short-lived entity (855–863). Upon his death, Provence was incorporated into Italy and Viennois into the Lotharingia of Lothair II. After a period of unrest, Provence was once again included in the imperial domain by the Treaty of Meerssen, though briefly, as it returned, upon the death of Emperor Louis II in 875, to the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, again for a short time. Boson of Provence, his brother-in-law, had himself proclaimed king of the second Kingdom of Provence in 879. Boson conflicted with the Carolingians. Boson's son, Louis, who became emperor, entrusted the governance of Provence to Hugh of Arles, who in turn handed it over in 934 to Rudolph II, King of Transjurane Burgundy. The new entity became the second Kingdom of Burgundy-Provence, also known as the Kingdom of Arles. It lasted until 1032.
In the 880s, some Saracens from the Emirate of Al-Andalus accidentally landed on the Var coast and established a base at Fraxinet ("Fraxinetum") or Freinet, traditionally located in the La Garde-Freinet region, from which they launched raids, particularly in eastern Lower Provence. Hugh of Arles led two victorious attacks against them in 931 and 942 with the help of Byzantine ships, but without pursuing the advantage to expel them entirely.
In 947, the Bosonid Boson, Count of Arles, was invested with Provence. Upon his death, his two sons, Guilhem known as the Liberator (William I) and Roubaud, jointly inherited the county, an indivision maintained by their descendants. The branch descending from Guilhem produced the Counts of Provence; the branch from Roubaud produced the Marquises of Provence.
The county of Provence within the Kingdom of Arles.
The County of Provence was one of the great fiefs of the Rodolphian Kingdom of Burgundy. In 948, Conrad the Peaceful, with the support of Otto, King of Germany, reclaimed the territory south of Viennois to the Mediterranean Sea, which had been excluded from the 932 cession by Hugh of Arles to Rudolph II of Burgundy. To govern this territory, Conrad appointed counts who were loyal to him and chosen from outside Provence, since Conrad had no personal domain in Provence and thus only theoretical ownership, preferring to appoint counts who would remain faithful to him. He selected two brothers from the Mâcon region, Boson and Guillaume, sons of Rotbald or Roubaud, with the former as Count of Arles and the latter as Count of Avignon. It seems both brothers acted jointly, with the younger subordinate to the elder in managing the north, center, west, and southeast of the County of Provence. In eastern Provence, Conrad appointed a third count, , in the region of Apt and probably Glandèves and Senez, to administer Alpine Provence. This choice of two counts from the same family in Arles and Avignon may stem from Hugh of Arles having, under the reign of Louis the Blind, unified the administration of the domain in Provence. To limit the risk of the County of Provence becoming independent of his sovereignty, Conrad divided authority by appointing two viscounts: one in Marseille and one in Cavaillon. The territories entrusted to the lords of Marseille and Cavaillon were separate from those of the counts of Arles, Avignon, and Apt. The viscounty of Apt quickly disappeared around 1017–1018. The appointment of distinct lords in Marseille deprived the counts of Arles and Avignon of easy access to the Mediterranean. This creation of the seigneury of Marseille is evidenced in a charter dated October 7, 948, where the bishop of Marseille, , , and Boson are mentioned. The term “viscounty” for Marseille first appeared in 977. The autonomy of the viscounty of Marseille relative to the County of Provence only ended with the authoritative actions of Charles of Anjou in 1252 and 1257. Conrad only visited the County of Provence in 963. The Kings of Burgundy seemed to have little interest in Provence. During the reigns of Conrad I and his son Rudolph III, four or five acts relating to Provence are known.
In 972, following the kidnapping of Mayeul, Abbot of Cluny, William I, and Roubaud, with the help of Provençal lords and the Marquis of Turin, liberated Provence from the Saracens who had been pillaging the region from the Massif des Maures (above Saint-Tropez). The Battle of Tourtour marked William's final victory over the Saracens. This military campaign against the Saracens, conducted without Conrad's troops, was a means to bring Provence, its local aristocracy, and its urban and rural communities—who had until then always resisted feudal transformation and comital power—into line. It allowed William to acquire de facto suzerainty over Provence. He distributed reconquered lands to his vassals, arbitrated disputes, and thereby established Provençal feudalism. Named marquis in 975, William made Arles his capital.Upon the death of Boson II of Arles, his two sons—William known as the Liberator, and Rotbold—shared the county jointly, a joint rule maintained by their descendants. The branch from Guilhem produced the Counts of Provence; the branch from Roubaud, from 1054 onward, produced the Counts of Forcalquier and the Marquises of Provence.
In 972, following the kidnapping of Maïeul of Cluny, Abbot of Cluny, William I, and Roubaud, with the help of Provençal lords and the Marquis of Turin, freed Provence from the Saracens who, from their fortress of Fraxinet, had been pillaging the region. This military campaign, conducted without the troops of Conrad I of Burgundy, served to subdue Provence, its local aristocracy, and the urban and rural communities that had always resisted feudal transformation and comital authority. It enabled William to gain de facto suzerainty over Provence. He distributed reconquered lands to his vassals, settled disputes, and thus established Provençal feudalism. Named Marquis in 975, William made Arles his capital.
As Rudolph III of Burgundy had no offspring, he named Conrad II the Salian, Holy Roman Emperor, as his heir. Upon Rudolph's death in 1032, the Kingdom of Burgundy—and with it the Kingdom of Arles, which included the County of Provence—was annexed to the Holy Roman Empire. However, the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Emperor over Provence thereafter was only nominal and theoretical.
In 1019, Emma, Countess of Provence, married William Taillefer, Count of Toulouse, transmitting the rights of Roubaud’s lineage to the House of Toulouse. The title of Marquis of Provence permanently passed to this house in 1093. In 1112, Douce of Provence, heir to the rights of Guilhem's line, married Raymond-Berenger III, Count of Barcelona, who became "Raymond-Berenger I of Provence". The Houses of Toulouse and Barcelona then entered into conflict over the marquisate. A treaty was concluded in 1125 between Raymond-Berenger and Alphonse-Jourdain of Toulouse: according to it, the County of Provence was divided into a marquisate north of the Durance—granted to the Counts of Toulouse—and a county to the south, granted to the Counts of Barcelona. Meanwhile, the northeastern part of the County of Provence had become de facto independent under the Count of Forcalquier. In 1193, Alfonso II of Provence married Gersande of Sabran, granddaughter of William II, Count of Forcalquier, which enabled the County of Provence to recover the southern part of the County of Forcalquier, while the northern part of this county, around Gap and Embrun, came under the suzerainty of the Dauphiné. This explains the presence of the dolphin emblem in the current coat of arms of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region.
During this period, the County of Orange, a vassal of Provence, was elevated to a principality in 1181.
Late Middle Ages.
In 1245, Raymond-Bérenger V of Provence died. His four daughters married respectively: Marguerite to Saint Louis (King Louis IX), Sancie to Richard of Cornwall, Eleanor to Henry III, King of England, and Beatrice to Charles, Count of Anjou and Maine, brother of Saint Louis. It was the latter who inherited the two counties of Provence and Forcalquier, passing them on to the first Capetian House of Anjou. That is why the city of Forcalquier is nicknamed "the city of the four queens." Accumulating royal titles (Naples-Sicily, Jerusalem, Cyprus, Acre, Thessalonica, etc.), the counts began calling themselves kings.
However, the County of Provence-Forcalquier was fragmented. Following the Treaty of Meaux-Paris (1229), which marked the end of the Albigensian Crusade, upon the death of Alphonse of Poitiers in 1271, the marquisate passed to King Philip III of France, who ceded it in 1274 to Pope Gregory X to become the Comtat Venaissin.
In 1349, neighboring region of Dauphiné became a feudal possession of the French royal House of Valois, thus expanding French influence beyond the river Rhône. In order to afirm imperial authority over the old Kingdom of Burgundy (Arles), the emperor Charles IV came to Provence in 1365, and was crowned as king of Burgundy in Arles. Since all of those regions were still considered as parts of the old Burgundian realm, within the Holy Roman Empire, the emperror appointed Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy as the imperial vicar of Burgundy (Arles). By 1378, new arangements were made by appointing the young French prince Charles, lord of Dauphiné (future king Charles VI), as the imperial vicar of Burgundy (Arles), but only for his lifetime. Thus, the imperial influence on old Burgundian lands, including Porvence, was additionally weakened.
In 1380, queen Joanna I of Naples, who was also the ruling countess of Provence, adopted her distant cousin Louis I of Anjou, who was brother of the French king Charles V. Thus in 1382, when she died, two pretenders claimed to inherite Provence, Louis of Anjou and Charles of Naples, from the cadet branch of the Capetian House of Anjou. The latter’s followers formed the Union of Aix (1382–1387), opposing Louis of Anjou, who gained suporters in western regions of Provence. Contrary to that, eastern Provence (east of the Var), being the only region that remained loyal to Charles, received no effective assistance, and thus Charles allowed it to submit to a lord of its choosing, as long as it was not an enemy. This led, in 1388, to the separation of the city of Nice and its corresponding administrative division (the viguerie), the city of Puget-Théniers, and the valleys of the Tinée and the Vésubie. Those cities nd regions formed the Terres Neuves de Provence (New Lands of Provence) and placed themselves under the protection of the House of Savoy — this is known as the . These lands became known as the County of Nice in 1526. The upper Ubaye valley, around Barcelonnette, also came under Savoyard suzerainty. France annexed the Barcelonnette region in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht, and Nice in 1860 by referendum.
In time, Louis of Anjou gained controll over the rest of Provence and thereby founded the second Capetian House of Anjou-Provence. This dynasty ended with the death of Charles V of Anjou in 1481.
On December 10, 1481, Count Charles III of Provence dictated a will naming King Louis XI of France as his universal heir. Charles III died the following day, December 11. On December 19, Louis XI instructed Palamède de Forbin to take possession of Provence. On December 29, the Estates (local representatives) met under the presidency of Pierre de La Jaille to acknowledge Charles III’s will. Forbin convened the Estates for January 15, 1482. The acts drafted and adopted from January 1482 to April 1487 confirmed the union of Provence and France “as one principal to another principal (...) without the County and the land of Provence being subordinate to the crown [of France].” In August 1486, the Estates requested Charles VIII to proclaim the union of Provence with France as “definitive and eternal.” The King of France granted their request with royal letters in October 1486, and communicated to the Estates on April 9, 1487. Legally, it was only a personal union of crowns—the King of France acted in Provence solely as Count of Provence, and this remained so until the French Revolution. “May it please Your Majesty to style yourself [...] Count of Provence, [...] so that we are in no way obliged to obey any letter lacking this title.”
Precursors to Independence.
There is no clear date of the first use of the title of Count of Provence, although an independent state had been forming for some time. The first non-Carolingian ruler of Provence was Boso who made himself king and was confirmed by the Synod of Mantaille, whose Bosonid descendants would rule Provence for a time. His son Louis was a short lasting Holy Roman Emperor who despite being crowned in 901 was twice expelled from Italy and on the second time was blinded and returned to Provence which was now effectively governed by his cousin, Hugh of Arles. Hugh moved the capital of Provence from Vienne to Arles, and when Louis died took the title Duke of Provence. Hugh became King of Italy in 926 ruling both Italy and Provence for twenty years. He traded Provence to Rudolph I of Burgundy in exchange for preserving his power in Italy. After Hugh's death Conrad of Burgundy became Count of Provence as King of Burgundy. He named a number of counts of Burgundian origin, one of whom Rotbald founded a new dynasty who would control the county for the next century and a half.
Despite unsuccessful attempts by Louis and Hugh to expel them, partially because they had been occupied in Italy, the Muslim Saracens had established a base on the coast of Provence called Fraxinetum, near modern-day Saint-Tropez. From here they controlled the mountains of the Massif des Maures and the coast between modern Fréjus and Hyères, and raided throughout Provence getting as far east as the Italian Riviera and north to the alpine valleys of Piedmont.
Expulsion of the Saracens.
In 973, the Saracens captured Maiolus, the abbot of the monastery at Cluny, and held him for ransom. The ransom was paid and the abbot was released. Count William I, the Count of Arles, organized an army with the help of allied soldiers from Piedmont, and defeated the Saracens near La Garde-Freinet at the Battle of Tourtour. The Saracens who were not killed at the battle were forcibly baptized and made into slaves, and the remaining Saracens in Provence fled the region.
The expulsion of the Saracens in 973 became an epic event in the history and legends of Provence. William became known as "William the Liberator." He distributed the lands taken from the Saracens between Toulon and Nice to his entourage. His descendants became the recognized leaders of Provence, above the other counts of the region.
During this long period of wars and banditry in Provence, the population retreated to walled cities, maritime trade was rare, and little new art or architecture, other than fortification, was created. The Provençal language was formed, closer to Latin than the French spoken in northern France. In the 11th century Provençal terms began to appear, mixed with Latin, in documents.
Catalan dynasty (12th-13th century).
The German Emperor Conrad the Salic forced the childless King of Burgundy, Rudolph III, to name him as successor which in 1032 led to Provence becoming a fiefdom of the Holy Roman Empire, which it remained until 1246.
There was a tradition of shared inheritance practiced by the family of the Counts, leading to two lines each using the title of Count. In 1112, a descendant of Count William I, Douce I, Countess of Provence, married the Catalan Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, who as a result became Raymond Berenguer I, Count of Provence. He ruled Provence until 1131, and his descendants, the Catalan Dynasty, ruled Provence until 1246.
The claim of the other line, sometimes using the title of Margraves of Provence, passed by marriage to William III, Count of Toulouse. This led to a long-standing Toulouse claim to the county, finally resolved by partition in 1125. Provence north and west of the Durance went to the Count of Toulouse, while the lands between the Durance and the Mediterranean, and from the Rhône to the Alps, stayed with the Counts of Provence. The capital of Provence was moved from Arles to Aix-en-Provence, and later to Brignoles. A shorter lasting partition in the next generation, between the County of Provence and the County of Forcalquier. was ended by an intra-dynastic marriage in 1193.
Following the Crusades, international commerce began to resume in the ports of the Mediterranean and along the Rhône. The port of Marseille flourished again. A new city built on the Petit-Rhône, Saint-Gilles, became a transit point for cloth from Flanders and spices and the products of the eastern Mediterranean. Tarascon and Avignon on the Rhône became important trading ports.
During the 12th century some of the cities of Provence became virtually autonomous. They were ruled by consuls, formally under the Counts of Provence but with considerable autonomy. Consulates existed in Avignon in 1229, 1131 in Arles, between 1140 and 1150 in Tarascon, Nice and Grasse, and 1178 in Marseille. Marseille went farther than the others, establishing a "confrerie" or charitable and religious organization of the one hundred leaders of the professions, crafts and businesses in the city, which drew up a code of justice and municipal regulations. Several Provençal cities directly negotiated commercial treaties with the republics of Pisa and Genoa in Italy. Other cities, however, such as Aix, Toulon, Hyères, Digne, Cavaillon and Carpentras, remained under the authority of the Counts. In the 13th century the counts of Provence suppressed most of the consulates, but the seeds of civil liberty and democracy had been planted in the cities.
France, Toulouse and Catalonia battle for Provence.
In the early 13th century the Albigensian crusade in neighboring Languedoc upset the existing order in Provence. Pope Innocent III sent missionaries and then soldiers to suppress the Cathar religious movement in Languedoc. The Pope accused Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse of supporting the Cathars, excommunicated him, and invited an army of French knights on a crusade to cleanse the south of France of the heresy. A war began in Provence between the French knights and the soldiers of Raymond VI and his son Raymond VII.
Soldiers from Tarascon, Marseille and Avignon joined the army of the Counts of Provence to fight the French. The French commander, Simon de Montfort, was killed at the siege of Toulouse in 1218. Then Raymond VI died in 1222, and a dispute over his lands in Provence began. King Louis VIII of France decided to intervene, and a French royal army marched down the valley of the Rhône and laid siege to Avignon. The city held out for three months but was finally forced by hunger to surrender. Avignon was forced to destroy its city walls and accept a French castle on the other side of the river, and by a treaty signed in Paris on April 12, 1229, the part of Provence west of the Rhône that had belonged to the Counts of Toulouse became part of France.
Beginning in 1220, Provence east of the Rhône had a new ruler, Ramon Berenguer IV, of the Catalan dynasty. He was the first Count of Provence to actually reside in Provence permanently, usually living with his court in Aix. He launched a military campaign to impose his authority over the cities of Provence, ending the independence of Grasse and Tarascon, occupying Nice, which had tried to ally with Genoa; and founding a new town, Barcelonette, in the far east of Provence, near the Italian border.
The ambitions of Ramon Berenguer were energetically resisted by the new Count of Toulouse, Raymond VII, who had lost most of his own territory to France. Raymond VII became an ally of Marseille and Avignon in their fight against Ramon Berenguer. In 1232 his army devastated the territories of Ramon Berenguer around Tarascon and Arles.
Ramon Berenguer responded to this attack by strengthening his alliance with France; he married his daughter, Marguerite, to King Louis IX of France, and appealed to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, for support. In exchange for his support, Frederic demanded that the cities of Arles and Avignon be governed by the Holy Roman Empire. A prolonged struggle took place between Raymond VII and his allies, the cities of Marseille and Avignon, against Ramon Berenguer for authority in Provence. Arles was blockaded and all traffic on the Rhône stopped.
The French army finally intervened to help Ramon Berenguer, the French king's father-in-law. Raymond VII was forced to abandon his quest, and Ramon Berenguer was able to appoint his own candidate as bishop of Avignon and to subdue the rest of eastern Provence. When Ramon Berenguer died in 1245, not quite forty years old, he controlled all of Provence between the Rhône and Italian border except the rebellious city of Marseille.
Ramon Berenguer had four daughters, but no sons. After his death his youngest daughter and heiress, Beatrice, married Charles, Count of Anjou, the youngest son of Louis VIII of France. Provence's fortunes became even more closely tied to the Angevin dynasty.
Good King René, the last ruler of Provence.
The 15th century saw a series of wars between the Kings of Aragon and the Counts of Provence. In 1423 the army of Alphonse V of Aragon captured Marseille, and in 1443 captured Naples and forced its ruler, King René I of Naples, to flee. He eventually settled in one of his remaining territories, Provence.
History and legend has given René the title "Good King René of Provence", though he only lived in Provence in the last ten years of his life, from 1470 to 1480, and his political policies of territorial expansion were costly and unsuccessful. Provence benefitted from population growth and economic expansion, and René was a generous patron of the arts, sponsoring painters Nicolas Froment, Louis Bréa, and other masters. He also completed one of the finest castles in Provence at Tarascon, on the Rhône.
When René died in 1480, his title passed to his nephew Charles du Maine. One year later, in 1481, when Charles died, the title passed to Louis XI of France. Provence was legally incorporated into the French royal domain in 1486.
Politics and administration.
Main cities.
The names below represent the names of the cities in Provençal, in both the classical (original and traditional) and the so-called Mistralian (modernized and French-influenced) orthographies. For the communes with only one spelling shown, it means that the spelling is the same in both writing systems, and thus the older or classically inspired form has been preserved in the phonetic (Mistralian) version.
The following translations come from Frédéric Mistral’s dictionary Lou Trésor dóu Felibrige and include the names of some major present-day towns in the County of Provence, showing both their natural evolution and the influence of French—with the original -"o" sound, which was pronounced similarly to -"ou", or the final -"a" becoming almost silent and resembling an -"o", -"e", or sometimes remaining -"a" depending on the region. The traditional -"nh" became -"gn", while it remained -nh in Portuguese, which adopted the spelling used by troubadours.
The translations in the Mistralian spelling are complemented by those in the classical spelling, which is inspired by the original orthography (before the strong influence of French) to give an authentic image to the language, while generally preserving the modern evolutions of the language such as the consonantal vocalization (consonant becoming a vowel) of -"l" into -"u", although this has been preserved in Languedoc (or Occitania).
Regardless of the spelling, the pronunciation is the same.
These classical translations come from the Provençal-French Dictionary (Diccionari provençau-francés) of the Creo-Provença association (supported by the Provence region, the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, the city of Aix-en-Provence, the city of Cannes, the city of Le Cannet, and the city of Mougins).
Culture.
Language.
The historical language of Provence is Occitan (revival of the term langue d’Oc by Occitanists replacing the term Provençal language (used for the entire South) around 1930) in its dialectal grouping called Provençal. Several varieties of Provençal are distinguished: Maritime (also called Marseillais or Central), Rhodanian, Alpine (also called Gavot), and Niçard. The Alpine Provençal or Gavot was also considered a variant of Provençal. Niçard derives from medieval Provençal and has received some Northern Italian influences.
Frédéric Mistral’s point of view on the langue d’Oc, called in his time the Provençal language and today more broadly Occitan: “The main dialects of modern langue d’Oc are: Provençal, Languedocian, Gascon, Aquitanian, Limousin, Auvergnat, and Dauphinois. Provençal includes the sub-dialects: Rhodanian, Marseillais (former name for Maritime), Alpine, and Niçard.”
Provence also included enclaves of Ligurian-speaking populations, whose dialect was called "Figoun" in Biot, Vallauris, Mouans-Sartoux, Mons, and Escragnolles. The Mentonasque dialect, spoken in Menton, is a transitional variety with Ligurian. In the Roya Valley, on the eastern borders of the Alpes-Maritimes, the Royasc and its variant Brigasc are used; both are transitional Ligurian dialects influenced by Vivaro-Alpine Occitan.
Literature.
The age of the troubadours.
The troubadours directly descended from the Provençal movement include Raimbaut d'Orange, Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, Albertet de Sisteron, Bertran de Lamanon, Folquet de Marseille, Blacatz, and Beatritz de Dia.
Heraldry.
The "ancient" arms of Provence are first recorded during the reign of Raymond Berenger V of Provence (1209–1245), grandson of Alfonso II of Aragon.
There are several theories regarding the origin of this coat of arms. French heraldist Michel Pastoureau suggests that the arms originated in Provence, tracing them to the Kingdom of Arles. He believes that the Counts of Barcelona, while governing Provence, brought these arms to Catalonia. However, heraldist Faustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués challenges this theory. He contends that the coat of arms was not inherited by Ramon Berenguer IV as Count of Barcelona but was instead a 16th-century attribution that linked the Counts of Provence to the Royal House of Aragon. According to Menéndez Pidal, the arms can be traced to Alfonso II of Aragon, the grandfather of Raymond Berenger V.

Building insulation

Building insulation is material used in a building (specifically the building envelope) to reduce the flow of thermal energy. While the majority of insulation in buildings is for thermal purposes, the term also applies to acoustic insulation, fire insulation, and impact insulation (e.g. for vibrations caused by industrial applications). Often an insulation material will be chosen for its ability to perform several of these functions at once.
Since prehistoric times, humans have created thermal insulation with materials such as animal fur and plants. With the agricultural development, earth, stone, and cave shelters arose. In the 19th century, people started to produce insulated panels and other artificial materials. Now, insulation is divided into two main categories: bulk insulation and reflective insulation. Buildings typically use a combination.
Insulation is an important economic and environmental investment for buildings. By installing insulation, buildings use less energy for heating and cooling and occupants experience less thermal variability. Retrofitting buildings with further insulation is an important climate change mitigation tactic, especially when buildings are heated by oil, natural gas, or coal-based electricity. Local and national governments and utilities often have a mix of incentives and regulations to encourage insulation efforts on new and renovated buildings as part of efficiency programs in order to reduce grid energy use and its related environmental impacts and infrastructure costs.

Thermal insulation usually refers to the use of appropriate insulation materials and design adaptations for buildings to slow the transfer of heat through the enclosure to reduce heat loss and gain. The transfer of heat is caused by the temperature difference between indoors and outdoors. Heat may be transferred either by conduction, convection, or radiation. The rate of transmission is closely related to the propagating medium. Heat is lost or gained by transmission through the ceilings, walls, floors, windows, and doors. This heat reduction and acquisition are usually unwelcome. It not only increases the load on the HVAC system resulting in more energy wastes but also reduces the thermal comfort of people in the building. Thermal insulation in buildings is an important factor in achieving thermal comfort for its occupants. Insulation reduces unwanted heat loss or gain and can decrease the energy demands of heating and cooling systems. It does not necessarily deal with issues of adequate ventilation and may or may not affect the level of sound insulation. In a narrow sense, insulation can just refer to the insulation materials employed to slow heat loss, such as: cellulose, glass wool, rock wool, polystyrene, polyurethane foam, vermiculite, perlite, wood fiber, plant fiber (cannabis, flax, cotton, cork, etc.), recycled cotton denim, straw, animal fiber (sheep's wool), cement, and earth or soil, reflective insulation (also known as a radiant barrier) but it can also involve a range of designs and techniques to address the main modes of heat transfer - conduction, radiation, and convection materials.
Most of the materials in the above list only retain a large amount of air or other gases between the molecules of the material. The gas conducts heat much less than the solids. These materials can form gas cavities, which can be used to insulate heat with low heat transfer efficiency. This situation also occurs in the fur of animals and birds feathers, animal hair can employ the low thermal conductivity of small pockets of gas, so as to achieve the purpose of reducing heat loss.
The effectiveness of reflective insulation (radiant barrier) is commonly evaluated by the reflectivity (emittance) of the surface with airspace facing to the heat source.
The effectiveness of bulk insulation is commonly evaluated by its R-value, of which there are two – metric (SI) (with unit K⋅W−1⋅m2) and US customary (with unit °F⋅ft2⋅h/BTU), the former being 0.176 times the latter numerically, or the reciprocal quantity the thermal conductivity or U-value W⋅K−1⋅m−2.
For example, in the US the insulation standard for attics, is recommended to be at least R-38 US units, (equivalent to R-6.7 or a U value of 0.15 in SI units). The equivalent standard in the UK are technically comparable, the approved document L would normally require an average U value over the roof area of 0.11 to 0.18 depending on the age of the property and the type of roof construction. Newer buildings have to meet a higher standard than those built under previous versions of the regulations.
It is important to realise a single R-value or U-value does not take into account the quality of construction or local environmental factors for each building. Construction quality issues can include inadequate vapor barriers and problems with draft-proofing. In addition, the properties and density of the insulation material itself are critical. Most countries have some regime of either inspections or certification of approved installers to make sure that good standards are maintained.
History of thermal insulation.
The history of thermal insulation is not so long compared with other materials, but human beings have been aware of the importance of insulation for a long time. In the prehistoric time, human beings began their activity of making shelters against wild animals and heavy weather, human beings started their exploration of thermal insulation. Prehistoric peoples built their dwellings by using the materials of animal skins, fur, and plant materials like reed, flax, and straw, these materials were first used as clothing materials, because their dwellings were temporary, they were more likely to use the materials they used in clothing, which were easy to obtain and process. The materials of animal furs and plant products can hold a large amount of air between molecules which can create an air cavity to reduce the heat exchange.
Later, human beings' long life spans and the development of agriculture determined that they needed a fixed place of residence, earth-sheltered houses, stone houses, and cave dwellings began to emerge. The high density of these materials can cause a time lag effect in thermal transfer, which can make the inside temperature change slowly. This effect keep inside of the buildings warm in winter and cool in summer, also because of the materials like earth or stone is easy to get, this design is really popular in many places like Russia, Iceland, Greenland.
Organic materials were the first available to build a shelter for people to protect themselves from bad weather conditions and to help keep them warm. But organic materials like animal and plant fiber cannot exist for a long time, so these natural materials cannot satisfy people's long-term need for thermal insulation. So, people began to search for substitutes which are more durable. In the 19th century, people were no longer satisfied with using natural materials for thermal insulation, they processed the organic materials and produced the first insulated panels. At the same time, more and more artificial materials start to emerge, and a large range of artificial thermal insulation materials were developed, e.g. rock wool, fiberglass, foam glass, and hollow bricks.
Significance of thermal insulation.
Thermal insulation can play a significant role in buildings, great demands of thermal comfort result in a large amount of energy consumed for full-heating for all rooms. Around 40% of energy consumption can be attributed to the building, mainly consumed by heating or cooling. Sufficient thermal insulation is the fundamental task that ensures a healthy indoor environment and against structure damages. It is also a key factor in dealing with high energy consumption, it can reduce the heat flow through the building envelope. Good thermal insulation can also bring the following benefits to the building:
Planning and examples.
How much insulation a house should have depends on building design, climate, energy costs, budget, and personal preference. Regional climates make for different requirements. Building codes often set minimum standards for fire safety and energy efficiency, which can be voluntarily exceeded within the context of sustainable architecture for green certifications such as LEED.
The insulation strategy of a building needs to be based on a careful consideration of the mode of energy transfer and the direction and intensity in which it moves. This may alter throughout the day and from season to season. It is important to choose an appropriate design, the correct combination of materials, and building techniques to suit the particular situation.
United States.
The thermal insulation requirements in the USA follow the ASHRAE 90.1 which is the U.S. energy standard for all commercial and some residential buildings. ASHRAE 90.1 standard considers multiple perspectives such as prescriptive, building envelope types and energy cost budget. And the standard has some mandatory thermal insulation requirements. All thermal insulation requirements in ASHRAE 90.1 are divided by the climate zone, it means that the amount of insulation needed for a building is determined by which climate zone the building locates. The thermal insulation requirements are shown as R-value and continuous insulation R-value as the second index. The requirements for different types of walls (wood framed walls, steel framed walls, and mass walls) are shown in the table.
To determine whether you should add insulation, you first need to find out how much insulation you already have in your home and where. A qualified home energy auditor will include an insulation check as a routine part of a whole-house energy audit. However, you can sometimes perform a self-assessment in certain areas of the home, such as attics. Here, a visual inspection, along with use of a ruler, can give you a sense of whether you may benefit from additional insulation. Residential energy audits are often initiated due homeowners being alerted by a gradual increase in their utility bills which often reflects the buildings attic as being poorly insulated.
An initial estimate of insulation needs in the United States can be determined by the US Department of Energy's ZIP code insulation calculator.
Russia.
In Russia, the availability of abundant and cheap gas has led to poorly insulated, overheated, and inefficient consumption of energy. The Russian Center for Energy Efficiency found that Russian buildings are either over- or under-heated, and often consume up to 50 percent more heat and hot water than needed. 53 percent of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Russia are produced through heating and generating electricity for buildings. However, greenhouse gas emissions from the former Soviet Bloc are still below their 1990 levels.
Energy codes in the Soviet Union start to establish in 1955, norms and rules first mentioned the performance of the building envelope and heat losses, and they formed norms to regulate the energy characteristics of the building envelope. And the most recent version of Russia energy code (SP 50.13330.2012) was published in 2003. The energy codes of Russia were established by experts of government institutes or nongovernmental organization like ABOK. The energy code of Russia have been revised several times since 1955, the 1995 versions reduced energy depletion per square meter for heating by 20%, and the 2000 version reduced by 40%. The code also has a mandatory requirement on thermal insulation of buildings accompany with some voluntary provisions, mainly focused on heat loss from the building shell.
Australia.
The thermal insulation requirements of Australia follow the climate of the building location, the table below is the minimum insulation requirements based on climate, which is determined by the Building Code of Australia (BCA). The building in Australia applies insulation in roofs, ceilings, external walls, and various components of the building (such as Veranda roofs in the hot climate, Bulkhead, Floors). Bulkheads (wall section between ceilings which are in different heights) should have the same insulated level as the ceilings since they suffer the same temperature levels. And the external walls of Australia's building should be insulated to decrease all kinds of heat transfer. Besides the walls and ceilings, the Australia energy code also requires insulation for floors (not all floors). Raised timber floors must have around 400mm soil clearance below the lowest timbers to provide sufficient space for insulation, and concrete slab such as suspended slabs and slab-on-ground should be insulated in the same way. 
China.
China has various climatic characters, which are divided by geographical areas. There are five climate zones in China to identify the building design include thermal insulation. (The very cold zone, cold zone, hot summer and cold winter zone, hot summer and warm winter zone and cold winter zone).
Germany.
Germany established its requirements of building energy efficiency in 1977, and the first energy code-the Energy Saving Ordinance (EnEV) which based on the building performance was introduced in 2002. And the 2009 version of the Energy Saving Ordinance increased the minimum R-values of the thermal insulation of the building shell and introduced requirements for air-tightness tests. The Energy Saving Ordinance (EnEV) 2013 clarified the requirement of thermal insulation of the ceiling. And it mentioned that if the ceiling was not fulfilled, thermal insulation will be needed in accessible ceilings over upper floor's heated rooms. [U-Value must be under 0.24 W/(m2⋅K)]
Netherlands.
The building decree (Bouwbesluit) of the Netherlands makes a clear distinction between home renovation or newly built houses. New builds count as completely new homes, but also new additions and extensions are considered to be new builds. Furthermore, renovations whereby at least 25% of the surface of the integral building is changed or enlarged is also considered to be a new build. Therefore, during thorough renovations, there's a chance that the new construction must meet the new building requirement for insulation of the Netherlands. If the renovation is of a smaller nature, the renovation directive applies. Examples of renovation are post-insulation of a cavity wall and post-insulation of a sloping roof against the roof boarding or under the tiles. Note that every renovation must meet the minimum Rc value of 1.3 W/(m2⋅K). If the current insulation has a higher insulation value (the legally obtained level), then this value counts as a lower limit.
New Zealand.
Insulation requirements for new houses and small buildings in New Zealand are set out in the Building Code and standard NZS 4128:2009.
Zones 1 and 2 include most of the North Island, including Waiheke Island and Great Barrier Island. Zone 3 includes the Taupo District, Ruapehu District, and the Rangitikei District north of 39°50′ latitude south (i.e. north of and including Mangaweka) in the North Island, the South Island, Stewart Island, and the Chatham Islands.
United Kingdom.
Insulation requirements are specified in the Building regulations and in England and Wales the technical content is published as Approved Documents
Document L defines thermal requirements, and while setting minimum standards can allow for the U values for elements such as roofs and walls to be traded off against other factors such as the type of heating system in a whole building energy use assessment.
Scotland and Northern Ireland have similar systems but the detail technical standards are not identical.
The standards have been revised several times in recent years, requiring more efficient use of energy as the UK moves towards a low-carbon economy.
Technologies and strategies in different climates.
Cold climates.
Strategies in cold climate.
In cold conditions, the main aim is to reduce heat flow out of the building. The components of the building envelope—windows, doors, roofs, floors/foundations, walls, and air infiltration barriers—are all important sources of heat loss; in an otherwise well insulated home, windows will then become an important source of heat transfer. The resistance to conducted heat loss for standard single glazing corresponds to an R-value of about 0.17 m2⋅K⋅W−1 or more than twice that for typical double glazing (compared to 2–4 m2⋅K⋅W−1 for glass wool batts). Losses can be reduced by good weatherisation, bulk insulation, and minimising the amount of non-insulative (particularly non-solar facing) glazing. Indoor thermal radiation can also be a disadvantage with spectrally selective (low-e, low-emissivity) glazing. Some insulated glazing systems can double to triple R values.
Technologies in cold climate.
The vacuum panels and aerogel wall surface insulation are two technologies that can enhance the energy performance and thermal insulating effectiveness of the residential buildings and commercial buildings in cold climate regions such as New England and Boston. In the past time, the price of thermal insulation materials that displayed high insulated performance was very expensive. With the development of material industry and the booming of science technologies, more and more insulation materials and insulated technologies have emerged during the 20th century, which gives us various options for building insulation. Especially in the cold climate areas, a large amount of thermal insulation is needed to deal with the heat losses caused by cold weather (infiltration, ventilation, and radiation). There are two technologies that are worth discussing:
Exterior insulation system (EIFS) based on Vacuum insulation panels (VIP).
VIPs are noted for their ultra-high thermal resistance, their ability of thermal resistance is four to eight times more than conventional foam insulation materials which lead to a thinner thickness of thermal insulation to the building shell compared with traditional materials. The VIPs are usually composed of core panels and metallic enclosures. The common materials that used to produce Core panels are fumed and precipitated silica, open-cell polyurethane (PU), and different types of fiberglass. And the core panel is covered by the metallic enclosure to create a vacuum environment, the metallic enclosure can make sure that the core panel is kept in the vacuum environment. Although this material has a high thermal performance, it still maintains a high price in the last twenty years.
Aerogel exterior and interior wall surface insulation.
Aerogel was first discovered by Samuel Stephens Kistle in 1931. It is a kind of gel of which the liquid component of the material is replaced by a gas, thus creating a material that is 99% air. This material has a relatively high R-value of around R-10 per inch which is considerably higher compared with conventional plastic foam insulation materials, due to their designed high porosity. But the difficulties in processing and low productivity limit the development of Aerogels, the cost price of this material still remains at a high level. Only two companies in the United States offer the commercial Aerogel product for wall insulation purposes.
Aerogels for glazing.
The DOE estimates thermal losses nearing 30% through windows, and thermal gains from sunlight leading to unwanted heating. Due to the high R associated with aerogels, their use for glazing applications has become an area of interest explored by many research institutions. Their implementation, however, must not hinder the primary function of windows: transparency. Typically, aerogels have low transmission and appear hazy, even amongst those considered transparent, which is why they have generally been reserved to wall insulation applications. Eldho Abraham, a researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder, recently demonstrated the capabilities of aerogels by designing a silanized cellulose aerogel (SiCellA) which offers near 99% visible transmission in addition to thermal conductivities which effectively reject or retain heat depending on the interior environment, akin to heating/cooling alterations. This is due to the designed 97.5% porosity of the SiCellA: pores are smaller than the wavelength of visible light, leading to transmission; the pores also minimize contact between the cellulose fibers, leading to lower thermal conductivities. The use of cellulose fibers lends itself to sustainability, as this is a naturally derived fiber sourced from wood pulps. This opens the door not only to aerogels, but also more general wood-based materials implementation in an effort to assist sustainable design alternatives with compounding energy saving effects.
Hot climates.
Strategies in hot climate.
In hot conditions, the greatest source of heat energy is solar radiation. This can enter buildings directly through windows or it can heat the building shell to a higher temperature than the ambient, increasing the heat transfer through the building envelope. The Solar Heat Gain Co-efficient (SHGC) (a measure of solar heat transmittance) of standard single glazing can be around 78–85%. Solar gain can be reduced by adequate shading from the sun, light coloured roofing, spectrally selective (heat-reflective) paints and coatings and, various types of insulation for the rest of the envelope. Specially coated glazing can reduce SHGC to around 10%. Radiant barriers are highly
effective for attic spaces in hot climates. In this application, they are much more effective in hot climates than cold climates. For downward heat flow, convection is weak and radiation dominates heat transfer across an air space. Radiant barriers must face an adequate air-gap to be effective.
If refrigerative air-conditioning is employed in a hot, humid climate, then it is particularly important to seal the building envelope. Dehumidification of humid air infiltration can waste significant energy. On the other hand, some building designs are based on effective cross-ventilation instead of refrigerative air-conditioning to provide convective cooling from prevailing breezes.
Technologies in hot climate.
In hot dry climate regions like Egypt and Africa, thermal comfort in the summer is the main question, nearly half of energy consumption in urban area is depleted by air conditioning systems to satisfy peoples' demand for thermal comfort, many developing countries in hot dry climate region suffer a shortage of electricity in the summer due to the increasing use of cooling machines. A new technology called Cool Roof has been introduced to ameliorate this situation. In the past, architects used thermal mass materials to improve thermal comfort, the heavy thermal insulation could cause the time-lag effect which might slow down the speed of heat transfer during the daytime and keep the indoor temperature in a certain range (Hot and dry climate regions usually have a large temperature difference between the day and night).
The cool roof is low-cost technology based on solar reflectance and thermal emittance, which uses reflective materials and light colors to reflect the solar radiation. The solar reflectance and the thermal emittance are two key factors that determine the thermal performance of the roof, and they can also improve the effectiveness of the thermal insulation since around 30% solar radiation is reflected back to the sky. The shape of the roof is also under consideration, the curved roof can receive less solar energy compared with conventional shapes. Meanwhile, the drawback of this technology is obvious that the high reflectivity will cause visual discomfort. On the other hand, the high reflectivity and thermal emittance of the roof will increase the heating load of the building.
Orientation – passive solar design.
Optimal placement of building elements (e.g. windows, doors, heaters) can play a significant role in insulation by considering the impact of solar radiation on the building and the prevailing breezes. Reflective laminates can help reduce passive solar heat in pole barns, garages, and metal buildings.
Construction.
See insulated glass and quadruple glazing for discussion of windows.
Building envelope.
The thermal envelope defines the conditioned or living space in a house. The attic or basement may or may not be included in this area. Reducing airflow from inside to outside can help to reduce convective heat transfer significantly.
Ensuring low convective heat transfer also requires attention to building construction (weatherization) and the correct installation of insulative materials.
The less natural airflow into a building, the more mechanical ventilation will be required to support human comfort. High humidity can be a significant issue associated with lack of airflow, causing condensation, rotting construction materials, and encouraging microbial growth such as mould and bacteria. Moisture can also drastically reduce the effectiveness of insulation by creating a thermal bridge (see below). Air exchange systems can be actively or passively incorporated to address these problems.
Thermal bridge.
Thermal bridges are points in the building envelope that allow heat conduction to occur. Since heat flows through the path of least resistance, thermal bridges can contribute to poor energy performance. A thermal bridge is created when materials create a continuous path across a temperature difference, in which the heat flow is not interrupted by thermal insulation. Common building materials that are poor insulators include glass and metal.
A building design may have limited capacity for insulation in some areas of the structure. A common construction design is based on stud walls, in which thermal bridges are common in wood or steel studs and joists, which are typically fastened with metal. Notable areas that most commonly lack sufficient insulation are the corners of buildings, and areas where insulation has been removed or displaced to make room for system infrastructure, such as electrical boxes (outlets and light switches), plumbing, fire alarm equipment, etc.
Thermal bridges can also be created by uncoordinated construction, for example by closing off parts of external walls before they are fully insulated.
The existence of inaccessible voids within the wall cavity which are devoid of insulation can be a source of thermal bridging.
Some forms of insulation transfer heat more readily when wet, and can therefore also form a thermal bridge in this state.
The heat conduction can be minimized by any of the following: reducing the cross sectional area of the bridges, increasing the bridge length, or decreasing the number of thermal bridges.
One method of reducing thermal bridge effects is the installation of an insulation board (e.g. foam board EPS XPS, wood fibre board, etc.) over the exterior outside wall. Another method is using insulated lumber framing for a thermal break inside the wall.
Installation.
Insulating buildings during construction is much easier than retrofitting, as generally the insulation is hidden, and parts of the building need to be deconstructed to reach them.
Depending on the country there are different regulations as to which type of insulation is the best alternative for buildings, considering energy efficiency and environmental factors. Geographical location also affects the type of insulation needed as colder climates will need a bigger investment than warmer ones on installation costs.
Materials.
There are essentially two types of building insulation - bulk insulation and reflective insulation. Most buildings use a combination of both types to make up a total building insulation system. The type of insulation used is matched to create maximum resistance to each of the three forms of building heat transfer - conduction, convection, and radiation.
The classification of thermal insulation materials.
According to three ways of heat exchange, most thermal insulation we use in our buildings can be divided into two categories: Conductive and convective insulators and radiant heat barriers. And there are more detailed classifications to distinguish between different materials. Many thermal insulation materials work by creating tiny air cavities between molecules, these air cavities can largely reduce the heat exchange through the materials. But there are two exceptions which don't use air cavities as their functional element to prevent heat transfer. One is reflective thermal insulation, which creates a great airspace by forming a radiation barrier by attaching metal foil on one side or both sides, this thermal insulation mainly reduces the radiation heat transfer. Although the polished metal foil attached on the materials can only prevent the radiation heat transfer, its effect to stop heat transfer can be dramatic. Another thermal insulation that doesn't apply air cavities is vacuum insulation, the vacuum-insulated panels can stop all kinds of convection and conduction and it can also largely mitigate the radiation heat transfer. But the effectiveness of vacuum insulation is also limited by the edge of the material, since the edge of the vacuum panel can form a thermal bridge which leads to a reduction of the effectiveness of the vacuum insulation. The effectiveness of the vacuum insulation is also related to the area of the vacuum panels.
Conductive and convective insulators.
Bulk insulators block conductive heat transfer and convective flow either into or out of a building. Air is a very poor conductor of heat and therefore makes a good insulator. Insulation to resist conductive heat transfer uses air spaces between fibers, inside foam or plastic bubbles and in building cavities like the attic. This is beneficial in an actively cooled or heated building, but can be a liability in a passively cooled building; adequate provisions for cooling by ventilation or radiation are needed.
Fibrous insulation materials.
Fibrous materials are made by tiny diameter fibers which evenly distribute the airspace. The commonly used materials are silica, glass, rock wool, and slag wool. Glass fiber and mineral wool are two insulation materials that are most widely used in this type.
Cellular insulation materials.
Cellular insulation is composed of small cells which are separated from each other. The commonly cellular materials are glass and foamed plastic like polystyrene, polyolefin, and polyurethane.
Radiant heat barriers.
Radiant barriers work in conjunction with an air space to reduce radiant heat transfer across the air space. Radiant or reflective insulation reflects heat instead of either absorbing it or letting it pass through. Radiant barriers are often seen used in reducing downward heat flow, because upward heat flow tends to be dominated by convection. This means that for attics, ceilings, and roofs, they are most effective in hot climates.
They also have a role in reducing heat losses in cool climates. However, much greater insulation can be achieved through the addition of bulk insulators (see above).
Some radiant barriers are spectrally selective and will preferentially reduce the flow of infra-red radiation in comparison to other wavelengths. For instance, low-emissivity (low-e) windows will transmit light and short-wave infra-red energy into a building but reflect the long-wave infra-red radiation generated by interior furnishings. Similarly, special heat-reflective paints are able to reflect more heat than visible light, or vice versa.
Thermal emissivity values probably best reflect the effectiveness of radiant barriers. Some manufacturers quote an 'equivalent' R-value for these products but these figures can be difficult to interpret, or even misleading, since R-value testing measures total heat loss in a laboratory setting and does not control the type of heat loss responsible for the net result (radiation, conduction, convection).
A film of dirt or moisture can alter the emissivity and hence the performance of radiant barriers.
Eco-friendly insulation.
Eco-friendly insulation is a term used for insulating products with limited environmental impact. The commonly accepted approach to determine whether or not an insulation product, or in fact any product or service is eco-friendly is by doing a life-cycle assessment (LCA). A number of studies compared the environmental impact of insulation materials in their application. The comparison shows that most important is the insulation value of the product meeting the technical requirements for the application. Only in a second order step, a differentiation between materials becomes relevant. The report commissioned by the Belgian government to VITO is a good example of such a study.

House of Baux

The House of Baux is a noble family from the south of France. It was one of the richest and most powerful families of medieval Provence, known as the 'Race d’Aiglon'. They were independent lords as castellans of Les Baux and Arles and wielded very considerable authority at the local level. They held important fiefs and vast lands, including the principality of Orange.
In (and in Provençal-Occitan, ) is the word for 'cliffs, escarpment'. In its use as the family name, it refers to the natural fortress on which the family built their castle, the Château des Baux and the village that surrounded it. The escarpment provided a raised and protected mountain valley that protected their food supply; the natural ridge of the Alpilles allowed control of all the approaches to the citadel of Les Baux-de-Provence and the surrounding countryside, including the passage up and down the Rhone, and the approaches from the Mediterranean. Together, these natural advantages made the fortress impervious to the military technology of the time.
The family of des Baux is still thriving today in Naples in the person of several noble families descended from younger sons who followed Charles of Anjou south. In particular from Bertrand, Lord of Baux and Prince of Orange, derive three cadet branches of the house, which moved to southern Italy, giving rise to the Italianized branches of the "Orsini del Balzo" Counts of Avellino, Dukes of Andria and Princes of Taranto.
After the death of , the last sovereign of Baux, the chateau and town were seized by King Rene, who gave them to his second wife, Queen Jeanne of Laval. When Provence was united with the crown almost 150 yrs of royal governors followed, including the lords, later counts and princes, de Manville. Les Baux became a centre for Protestantism. Its unsuccessful revolt against the crown led Cardinal Richelieu in 1632 to order that the castle and its walls should be demolished. This was accomplished with the aid of artillery.
Lords of Baux.
The earliest definite ancestor was Pons (, 'Pons the Younger'). The name may indicate a trader from Greece, while his sobriquet, 'the Younger', distinguished him from his father, Pons the Elder. Pons the Younger was mentioned in three legal acts:
The family descent then is:
This branch of the House of Baux was declared extinct in 1426. The domains were inherited by Counts of Provence.
Lords of Berre, Meyragues, Puyricard and Marignane.
From this branch originated the family branches of the , Lords of Meyrargues and Puyricard, who became extinct in 1349, and lords of Marignane, acquired by House of Valois-Anjou, as well as the Dukes of Andria.
Princes of Orange.
In 1417, the House of Ivrea or House of Chalon-Arlay succeeded as princes of Orange.
A brother of William I started the branch of the Lords of Courbezon (House of Baux-Courbezon), which became extinct in 1393. Another brother started the line of Lords of Suze, Solerieux and Barri (House of Baux-Suze-Solerieux-Barri), which became extinct and reverted afterwards to the counts of Orange.

Howqua

Wu Bingjian (; 17694 September 1843), trading as "Houqua" and better known in the West as "Howqua" or "Howqua II", was a hong merchant in the Thirteen Factories, head of the "E-wo hong" and leader of the Canton Cohong. He was once the richest man in the world.
Biography.
A Hokkien by his paternal ancestry with ancestry from Quanzhou, Wu was known to the West as "Howqua", as was his father, Wu Guorong, the founder of the family business or "hong". The name "Howqua" is a romanization, in his native Hokkien language, of the business name under which he traded, "浩官" (). He became rich on the trade between China and the British Empire in the middle of the 19th century during the First Opium War. Perhaps the wealthiest man in China during the nineteenth century, Howqua was the senior of the hong merchants in Canton, one of the few authorized to trade silk and porcelain with foreigners. In an 1822 fire which burned down many of the cohongs, the silver that melted allegedly formed a little stream almost two miles in length. Of the three million dollars that the Qing government was required to pay the British as stipulated in the Treaty of Nanking, Howqua single-handedly contributed one million. He died the same year in Canton.
After the Opium Wars, Howqua's familial and business lineage quickly diminished. In 1891, the American trading house that had been handling Howqua's international investments, Russell &amp; Company, collapsed. The descendants of Howqua are now commoners. What had been a massive and beautiful estate for the Howqua family is now relatively unmarked in a poor neighborhood in the region of Honam.
The founders of then world-renowned firms including James Matheson, William Jardine, Samuel Russell and Abiel Abbot Low all had a close relationship with Howqua. Portraits of the pigtailed Howqua in his robes still hang in Salem and Newport mansions built by American merchants grateful for his assistance.
Legacy.
Following the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, which spelled the end of the Thirteen Factories, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co continued to use "Ewo" as their Chinese name.
A settlement on the east bank of Lake Eildon, from Mansfield, in Victoria, Australia, is named after him, possibly by Chinese miners who passed through the area during the Victorian gold rush.

Arkansas Highway 321

Highway 321 (AR 321, Ark. 321, Hwy. 321) is a designation for two north–south state highways in central Arkansas. One route of runs from Interstate 57 (I-57) in Cabot north to Highway 38 east of Austin. A second route of begins at AR 31 north of Beebe and runs north to Highway 267.
Route description.
Cabot to Austin.
Highway 321 begins near an interchange with I-57/US 67/US 167 at Highway 5 and Highway 367 in Cabot. The route intersects Highway 89 in south Cabot before exiting the city and running due east. Near Oak Grove, the route turns due north, with Highway 321 Spur (AR 321S) continuing east to Highway 31. A 2010 study of annual average daily traffic (AADT) by the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD) reveals that about 19,000 vehicles per day (VPD) use the route between its southern terminus and Highway 89/Highway 367, with the traffic count dropping to 7,000 VPD between that junction and the Cabot city limits. Traffic counts continue around 2,500 VPD until the Highway 321S junction, then drop to 2,100 VPD for the remainder of the route.
Beebe to Essex.
Highway 321 begins north of Beebe at Highway 31. The route runs north, having a junction with Highway 321 Spur and passing through Essex. The highway continues north and terminates at Highway 267. An AHTD traffic count from 2010 reveals that the average annual daily traffic never exceeds 640 vehicles per day anywhere on the route.
Special routes.
Lonoke County spur.
Highway 321 Spur (AR 321S, Ark. 321S, and Hwy. 321S) is an east–west state highway spur route in Lonoke County. The route of serves as a connector between Highway 321 and Highway 31.
White County spur.
Highway 321 Spur (AR 321S, Ark. 321S, and Hwy. 321S) is an east–west state highway spur route in White County. The route of serves as a short connector between Highway 321 and Highway 31.

University College Boat Club (Durham)

University College Boat Club (UCBC) is the rowing club of University College at Durham University on the River Wear in England.
UCBC has won the Grand Challenge Cup at Durham Regatta more than any other College (the majority of these wins in the 19th Century) and has qualified for Henley Royal Regatta, most recently in 2001.
Founded in 1834, UCBC is the oldest society in Durham University and is the oldest Boat Club in the North of England. The club celebrated its 175th anniversary at Durham Regatta in 2009. The Alumni organisation is "Floreat Castellum" Boat Club (FCBC).
UCBC is a registered Boat Club through British Rowing, with Boat Code "UCD" and is a member organisation of Durham College Rowing.
History.
UCBC was founded in 1834, soon after University College and the University were established. The first Durham Regatta was held over 17–19 June 1834, opening with a six-oared race in 1834 won by "Velocity", owned by W. L. Wharton, High Sheriff of Durham, against University College in "Sylph". Following the establishment of Hatfield Hall, UCBC was part of the first intercollegiate race, against Hatfield College Boat Club in 1850.
When the Grand Challenge Cup (for coxed Fours) was introduced at Durham Regatta in 1854 it was won seven times by crews from UCBC before 1862, with teams from rival Hatfield typically coming second. However, the founding of Durham Amateur Rowing Club and increased entries from further afield would eventually bring an end to University College's dominance. Entries for competitive races around this time could be informal, and often formed by scratch teams rowing under the name of the boat and not the collegiate body to which they belonged, making it difficult to successfully identify college crews in the early records.
Although University College Boat Club and Hatfield College Boat Club (1846) had been established soon after the founding of their respective colleges, Durham University Boat Club (DUBC) was only formally founded in 1877 'to produce representative student crews and to act as the controlling body' for various clubs already active. UCBC focussed on local races within Durham, including Durham Regatta and intercollegiate events such as Senate Cup. 
In the 1880s the current college boathouse was built, and was constructed with a bar and baths. These have since been removed to allow additional racking space. The original club landing stage was closer to the weir, but was later rebuilt at the present location upstream in 1959 to allow more space to maneuver between the stage and the weir. In 1897, Durham Amateur Rowing Club (DARC) built their boathouse next door, until moving to their new boathouse in 1969. Now St Leonard's School Boat Club occupy the adjacent boathouse. 
Both world wars and the Great Depression caused reductions in the number of students at the college, and in the club. The club entered the Second World War with an elderly fleet in need of replacement. The war and post war austerity limited further boat building so the club spent the post war years with an outdated fleet, limiting club successes. 
In the following decades, college membership increased, with similar increases in club size. In 1987, the college admitted women, and the first women's captain was appointed in 1988. As the membership rose, the club began to enter races across the country, including the Britannia Challenge Club at Henley Royal Regatta in 2001.
Boathouse and fleet.
UCBC uses University College boathouse on the River Wear just below Durham Cathedral and a short walk from the Castle. It is at one end of the rowable stretch of river in Durham, on the Bailey, downstream of Prebends Bridge but upstream of the weir. St Aidan's College Boat Club (SACBC) also racks boats in this boathouse.
UCBC owns 2 VIIIs, 6 IVs, and smaller boats. These were manufactured by Vespoli, Stampfli, Janousek, WinTech, Sims and Browns Boathouse and the oars were produced by Concept2.
For races outside Durham the club either rents local boats or rents trailer space e.g. from Durham Amateur Rowing Club or Durham University Boat Club.
Races.
UCBC competes in many races and regattas both in the North East and the rest of the United Kingdom. Below are some of the events UCBC has competed in the past:
National events
Regional events
College events
A 24-hour indoor rowing marathon used to be held annually against rival Hatfield College Boat Club. The charity event was jointly run by both clubs in Epiphany term.
Club structure.
Any member of University College JCR, MCR or SCR can join UCBC as an ordinary member and any other student of Durham University may join with the President's permission. The club is run by an executive committee selected annually. These are the President, Men's Captain, Women's Captain, Secretary, Treasurer, Novice Captains, Social Secretary, Safety &amp; Welfare Officer, Communications Officer and Boatman. As a tradition, the handover occurs when the 1st VIII crosses the finish line in the (unofficial) race against FCBC at Durham Regatta.
All club members are able to join the club's alumni organisation "Floreat Castellum" Boat Club (FCBC). This organises an annual dinner and drinks at Henley Royal Regatta as well as an invitational race at Durham Regatta against the current UCBC 1st VIII. All members of FCBC are treated as life members of UCBC. Since 2011, FCBC has donated two 8+'s and three 4+'s to UCBC. 
UCBC holds an annual Ball each year in Epiphany term. Previous locations include Durham Town Hall, The Royal County Hotel in Durham, The Three Tuns Hotel in Durham and the Assembly Rooms Newcastle.
Club colours.
The club blades are cardinal with a white chevron, cardinal being the colour of University College.
The club racing kit is defined for all-in-ones as "black with cardinal side strip" or the club Zephyrs as "White with Cardinal Trim". For winter racing, the club tech tops are "black with cardinal trim". Members of the 1st VIII are eligible to wear different tech tops: "white with cardinal trim and 1st VIII on the collar".
The club blazer is "white with cardinal trim". 1 or 2 stripes on the sleeves indicate current or past membership of the second or first VIII respectively. This can be worn at all club socials and some college events.

Getting Away with Murder (film)

Getting Away with Murder is a 1996 American black comedy film directed and written by Harvey Miller.
Plot.
Ethics professor Jack Lambert's neighbor Max Mueller is revealed on the TV news to be escaped Nazi war criminal Karl Luger, whom the courts sentenced to death. Pressured by the news media's allegations, Mueller plans escape to South America.
Angered that Mueller might never pay for his crimes, Lambert takes the drastic step of poisoning him by injecting cyanide into some of the fruit in Mueller's apple tree, from which he regularly makes freshly juiced apple juice. The police initially believe it's a suicide, greatly upsetting Lambert, who mails them a cryptic letter explaining that it was actually a murder to carry out the court sentence and to avenge all the lives taken.
Later, the TV news reveals that Mueller was misidentified and is innocent. Feeling guilty, Lambert atones by dumping his fiancée Gail and marrying Mueller's daughter Inga. However, after the wedding, Lambert receives information assuring him of Mueller's guilt.
Reception.
This was veteran writer and director Harvey Miller's final project. It received poor reviews from critics and has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 8 reviews.
Daniel M. Kimmel of "Variety" described the film as "a distasteful affair that should embarrass all concerned. A lighthearted comedy about the Holocaust and an accused Nazi war criminal, it opened with little advance word and no advance screenings. That strategy was the one smart move Savoy made concerning this film, since this one is D.O.A."
Janet Maslin of "The New York Times" wrote that "Miller's film looks professional and polished, but its comic timing is unerringly flat. Despite literate dialogue and the efforts of a worthy cast, the whole thing lacks any humorous spark. [...] Like "Faithful", another indifferent comedy left behind after the demise of Savoy Pictures, "Getting Away with Murder" doesn't have anything radically wrong with it. All that's wrong is that it doesn't get anything right."
Reviewing the HBO/Savoy video release, Erin Richter of "Entertainment Weekly" said that "release delays and limited theatrical runs for comedies with seemingly solid casts don't always indicate a problem film, but they do in the case of writer-director Harvey Miller's paean to one man's attempt at righteousness. [...] What could have been a smart and sardonic—not to mention timely—social commentary turns into a humorless collection of caricatures that even the more forgiving video screen doesn't improve."
The opening paragraph of James Berardinelli's review of the film for "ReelViews" read:
Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, writing, "Here is a film that tries to find comedy in the Holocaust, and it looks in the wrong places, in the wrong way, and becomes a sad embarrassment."
Nathan Rabin wrote, ""Murder" suffers from what I call Craig Brewer Syndrome [...] Filmmakers afflicted with Craig Brewer Syndrome make the least offensive films out of the most offensive premises. [...] Lemmon and Tomlin deliver better performances than the material warrants. A deceptively playful Lemmon is plausible as both a genocidal monster in hiding and a harmless old man and Tomlin's uncompromising performance is refreshingly devoid of sentimentality. Yet their best efforts are wasted in a movie that aspires to make audiences laugh and think and only achieves half its goals."
Home media.
After the film's theatrical run, HBO released the movie onto VHS. In 2004, the film was released on DVD.

Jutta Rüdiger

Jutta Rüdiger (14 June 1910 – 13 March 2001) was a German psychologist and head of the Nazi Party's female youth organisation, the League of German Girls (Bund Deutscher Mädel, BDM), from 1937 to 1945.
Early career.
Rüdiger was born in Berlin but brought up in Düsseldorf where her father was an engineer. She trained as a psychologist. While a student at Würzburg in the 1920s, she became a convinced Nazi and joined the National Socialist German Students' League (Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund). From 1933 she was an assistant psychologist at the Institute for Occupational Research in Düsseldorf.
She became active in the leadership of the BDM, which had been started in 1930 as a girls' auxiliary to the male-only Hitler Youth, but which grew rapidly after the Nazis came to power in January 1933. She described the connection that she and millions of German people felt towards Hitler and his rise to power around this time: "the people were really hungry. It was very, very hard. And in that context, Hitler with his statements seemed to be the bringer of salvation. I myself had the feeling that here was a man who did not think about himself and his own advantage, but solely about the good of the German people."In 1935, Rüdiger became BDM Leader in the Ruhr-Lower Rhine region. In November 1937 she became Leader of the BDM, at which time she joined the Nazi Party. She succeeded Trude Mohr, who had vacated the position on her marriage, as Nazi policy required. Rüdiger was leader until 1945.
Career in the Reich.
As BDM Leader, Rüdiger had the title Reichs Deputy of the BDM (Reichsreferentin des BDM). This signified that her position was subordinate to the overall Nazi Youth Leader (Reichsjugendführer), Baldur von Schirach (and his successor from 1940, Artur Axmann). This was in accordance with Nazi policy that women and their organisations must always be subordinate to male leadership. Schirach was zealous in preventing the BDM becoming autonomous, or coming under the control of the Nazi Women's Organisation (Nationalsozialistische Frauenschaft, NSF), whose Leader Gertrud Scholtz-Klink he regarded as a rival.
Membership of the BDM became compulsory for girls between 10 and 18 in 1936, and the law was strengthened in 1939, but membership was never as universal as membership of the Hitler Youth was for boys. The destiny of BDM girls under the Nazi state was to then participate in the "Glaube und Schönheit" (Faith and Beauty) society, open for ages 17 to 21. They would then become wives to Nazi men to bear many children to increase the strength of the Aryan race.
According to Rüdiger, leader of the League of German Girls in 1937:"The task of our Girls League is to bring up our girls as torch bearers of the national-socialist world. We need girls who are at harmony between their bodies, souls and spirits. And we need girls who, through healthy bodies and balanced minds, embody the beauty of divine creation. We want to bring up girls who believe in Germany and our leader, and who will pass these beliefs on to their future children."
By 1941, however, there was an acute labour shortage in Germany as some men were conscripted and sent to the front, and the BDM girls were increasingly pressed into compulsory labour service, usually either on farms or in munitions factories, with girls from upper or middle-class families going into office jobs. Rüdiger came to preside over a female work force of several millions, directing them as the economic ministries requested additional labour.
From 1943 onwards, the BDM also supplied thousands of girls for work in flak (anti-aircraft) batteries guarding German cities. By means of this, the Nazi system would allow young women to come to combat service. Girls as young as 13 operated flak batteries, fired guns and shot down Allied planes. Many were killed when their batteries were hit by bombs or machine-gun fire from Allied fighters. Later in the war, BDM girls fought against the advancing Allied armies.
Arrest and later life.
Rüdiger was arrested by American forces in 1945, and spent two and a half years in detention. Rüdiger was not charged with any specific offence, and was never brought to trial. Upon her release, she resumed her career as a paediatric psychologist, in the areas of the educational guidance and industrial psychology, in Düsseldorf. She also maintained a membership of the Association of German Professional Psychologists.
According to historian Michael Kater, she remained "an unreconstructed Nazi". In a 2000 interview she said: "National Socialism is not repeatable. One can take over only the values which we espoused: comradeship, readiness to support one another, bravery, self-discipline and not least honour and loyalty. Apart from these, each young person must find their way alone."
From 1940 to 1991, she lived in a lesbian relationship with her partner and cooperator Hedy Böhmer. She died in 2001 at Bad Reichenhall, Bavaria.

Frankston High School

Frankston High School (abbreviated as FHS) or simply Frankston High, is a government-funded co-educational high school, located in , Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The school offers education for students from Year 7 to Year 12.
School profile.
Frankston High School is a large multi-campus co-educational facility situated in Frankston South. The Year 7 to 10 and Senior School (Years 11 and 12) campuses occupy sites across from one another.
The school has formed a partnership, the Frankston Federation of Schools, with the main neighbourhood primary schools Derinya, Overport, Frankston and Frankston Heights. Through this federation, staff and resources are shared. A transition program helps students adjust from primary to secondary school.
In 2006 a Tablet PC programme was launched, which created two "streams" for students to take either tablet, or non-tablet classes from the commencement of Year 7 onwards. The tablet programme was for students to use technology every day in all classes for their education. In 2015, the two streams were merged, and it was made compulsory for all students to purchase a Windows Surface Pro prior to commencing Year 7, as part of their school resources.
Frankston High School was ranked 16th out of all state secondary schools in Victoria based on VCE results in 2018.
Sustainability.
An updated school sustainability policy was ratified by the school's parent council in late 2014.
In 2015 the St Kilda Eco Centre awarded students in the Eco Team a scholarship to participate in a Polperro Dolphin Swim, recognizing their investigation of micro-plastics at Frankston foreshore.
Languages.
Both Japanese and French languages are established in the curriculum from Year 7 to Year 12. Sister city and sister school programmes have been established in Japan, France and Soweto, South Africa. The school operates an overseas exchange program, with Frankston High School students on exchange programs in other countries and a number of overseas students studying at Frankston.
Music.
There are seven bands operating and approximately 200 students involved in the instrumental music program. Students perform regularly at assemblies and special events and rehearse in a music centre. Concert band and stage band are the two main bands which are available for students at Frankston, as well as smaller, varying music ensembles, such as the guitar ensemble. The establishment of the Harry McGurk Music Scholarship has helped students to continue with these opportunities.

A school magazine entitled "Kananook" is published every year. It looks back over the year and recognises what the school has accomplished.
House competition.
The four houses are:
The recent former house names come from early explorers of Victoria and the Port Phillip region - George Bass, William Collins, Matthew Flinders, and John Murray.
The houses compete in three major competitions: swimming, athletics and cross country.
The new house names based on words in the Bunarong language came into effect in 2022.
Sister schools.
Frankston is the sister city of Susono, Shizuoka in Japan. The school maintains a sister school relationship with Kawaguchi-Kita High School in the Greater Tokyo Area, which began in 1988. Regular cultural visits and student exchanges take place between these schools.
Frankston also has a sister school relationship with Lycée Jean Zay, in Orléans, France. Students regularly visit and exchange between the two, with four-month twin exchanges during the summer holidays. Students of French have the chance to visit France every second year, with a group extending their visit to include Italian Art galleries.
Frankston High School also has a sister school relationship with Letsibogo Girls' High School in Soweto, South Africa. In conjunction with Mentone Girls' Secondary College and Mac.Robertson Girls' High School the school sponsors three girls, enabling them to spend a year studying and implementing GIS in Australia, hosted by school families.

Accommodative convergence

Accommodative convergence is that portion of the range of inward rotation of both eyes (i.e., convergence) that occurs in response to an increase in optical power for focusing by the crystalline lens (i.e., accommodation). When the human eye engages the accommodation system to focus on a near object, signal is automatically sent to the extraocular muscles that are responsible for turning their eyes inward. This is helpful for maintaining single, clear, and comfortable vision during reading or similar near tasks. However, errors in this relationship can cause problems, such as hyperopic individuals having a tendency for crossed eyes because of the over exertion of their accommodation system.
Clinically, accommodative convergence is measured as a ratio of convergence, measured in prism diopters, to accommodation, measured in diopters of near demand. The patient is instructed to make a near target perfectly clear and their phoria is measured as the focusing demand on the eye is changed with lenses.
To determine stimulus AC/A, the denominator refers to the value of the stimulus, whereas to determine response AC/A, the actual accommodation elicited is the denominator. Determination of response AC/A an increase in AC/A mainly after 40 years of age, whereas assessment of the stimulus AC/A does not show change in AC/A with increasing age. Whether there is a significant increase in the response AC/A before age 40 is unclear. Research on convergence accommodation (CA) shows a decrease in CA/C, whether measured by response or stimulus methods, with increasing age.

P.J. Cuddy

PJ Cuddy was a hurling player with Laois and Camross. He was voted on the "Laois Team of the Millennium", and has been called "the best full forward of his generation" by the Leinster Express.
Biography.
Cuddy played with Laois for more than 15 years. The youngest of a family of 11, Cuddy acquired a passion for hurling at an early age. He was just 18 when he won his first Laois Senior Hurling Championship medal with Camross in 1976. Later that season, Camross captured the Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship title with a victory over James Stephens (Kilkenny). They subsequently beat Ballycran (Down) in the All-Ireland semi-final but were denied the final title by Cork kingpins Glen Rovers.
Cuddy went on to captain the Laois under 21 team in 1979. Laois reached the Leinster final that year but their captain missed the defeat to Offaly after being sent off in an earlier game. It was the only time in his career that he missed a game through suspension.
The following year, Cuddy was promoted to the senior team (his brothers Ger and Sean had also played senior for Laois) and he made his debut as a substitute in a National Hurling League defeat to Clare at Portlaoise. He was selected from the start for Laois’ next outing against Antrim.
Despite the defeat to Clare, the O’Moore County succeeded in gaining promotion to Division 1 in 1981 and were drawn to face Tipperary in the quarter-final. Tipp were favourites, but two goals from Cuddy turned the game in Laois’ favour. They subsequently lost to neighbours and bogey side Offaly at the penultimate round stage.
A Railway Cup winner with Leinster in 1988, Cuddy brought his inter-county career to a close in 1996 with no silverware to show for his years of service. At club level, however, he garnered 12 county senior championship medals. The Cuddy name is synonymous with Camross hurling. At one stage, there were seven Cuddys on the club's senior team.
Twenty years on from his first Leinster club championship success, Cuddy won his second Leinster medal in 1996 when Camross defeated O’Toole's of Dublin in the provincial decider. Camross’ bid for the All-Ireland title was eventually ended by Athenry of Galway.
In 2009, he became the new manager of Camross.

Nicholas Civella

Nicholas Civella (born Giuseppe Nicoli Civella; March 19, 1912 – March 12, 1983) was an American mobster who became a prominent boss of the Kansas City crime family.
Early life.
Civella was born to Italian immigrants in Kansas City. He was the younger brother of mobster Carl "Cork" Civella and the uncle of mobster Anthony Civella. Nicholas Civella began his criminal career as a teenager in the Italian "North End" neighborhood of Kansas City. Civella's first arrest was at age 10, after which he dropped out of school. Before he reached age 20, Civella had been arrested for auto theft, illegal gambling, robbery, and vagrancy.
In 1932, Civella spent two months in prison for bootlegging. In 1934 Civella married Katherine, his wife for almost fifty years. He had no children of his own. In the early 1940s, Civella became a Democratic Party precinct worker on the North Side of Kansas City and became friends with Kansas City crime boss, Charles Binaggio.
Rise to power.
By the 1950s, Civella dominated criminal activity in Kansas City. In 1950, he was identified as a figure in the organized crime society during the U.S. Senate Kefauver hearings. Although Kansas City remained a satellite of the larger Chicago Outfit criminal organization, Civella attended the ill-fated 1957 Apalachin Meeting of mob bosses in Apalachin, New York. Civella's involvement with organized crime led to the Nevada Gaming Commission listing Civella as one of the first entries in the Black Book, prohibiting him from entering casinos in Nevada. Later, due to his acquaintance with Teamsters president Roy Lee Williams, Civella played an important role in controlling the Central States Pension Fund of the Teamsters Union and in the skimming of casino gambling profits in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Arrests and convictions.
In 1959, Civella was sent a summons before a grand jury and subsequently convicted of tax evasion. In the two Missouri state tax evasion cases, he was convicted and fined $150 in one case, while the other case was dismissed. During this period, Civella built relations with the Cosa Nostra families in St. Louis, Denver, Milwaukee, and California.
In 1966, Civella was called to appear before a Clay County, Missouri grand jury. Afterwards, the news media asked him why it took him 15 minutes to address the group. Civella replied that he "stopped in the men’s room," where he "was drawing dirty pictures on the wall." Law enforcement agencies did not appreciate Civella's humor or his ability to elude conviction. This would result in their constant surveillance of him for the rest of his life.
In 1977, Civella was convicted of illegal gambling charges and sent to prison. The key to the conviction was a telephone conversation recorded via wiretap during Super Bowl IV. Whereas the hometown Kansas City Chiefs were 12-point underdogs to the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings, local action favored the hometown team. When Civella phoned his bookie to determine just how much they had lost ($47,630), authorities used this recorded call to move on Civella and place him under arrest.
In 1980, Civella was convicted of attempting to bribe a prison official to transfer his nephew Anthony to a minimum-security prison in Texas.
Death.
In February 1983, Nicholas Civella received a medical release due to poor health from the Federal Medical Center, a prison medical facility, at Springfield, Missouri. Two weeks later, on March 12, 1983, Civella died of lung cancer in Kansas City. Upon his death, his brother Carl "Cork" Civella became head of the Kansas City family.
2011 revelations.
In 2011, a 900-page report by the Kansas City Police Department on the assassination of civil rights leader and politician Leon Jordan concluded that Civella had given the order to kill Jordan.

List of rowing blades

This is a list of blades of national teams, rowing clubs, schools and universities. The designs are not trademarked while the sport remains near globally not-for-profit although in some jurisdictions a club may assert design rights and similar to prevent imitation. It is also possible where identical or near identical blades are watched in winter head races or in summer side-by-side (multi-lane regatta) races for there to be instances of mistaken identity among supporters all of which considerations are commonly borne in mind instead of choosing unpainted blades among established clubs.
National teams.
National teams often draw their colours from the related national flags.
Clubs.
Club colours may be entirely original or very often based on local governmental or manorial coats of arms. 
School and university.
As with other academic sports teams the blades used tend to draw as their inspiration heraldry of their academic institutions. On rare occasions a colour difference between male and female blades is found in academic settings, as in the case of Worcester College, Oxford.

Jean-François Hodoul

Jean-François Hodoul (11 April 1765 – 10 January 1835) was a sea captain, corsair, and later merchant and plantation owner in Isle de France (Mauritius).
Origins.
Hodoul was born on 11 April 1765 La Ciotat, Provence. His father, Raymond, was a charcutiere; his mother was Geneviève Cauvin. He left for France's colonies in the Indian Ocean at the age of 24, and arrived at Mauritius in 1789, on board "Scipion". Other sources state that he arrived there on 12 April 1790, the day after his 25th birthday.
He rapidly became a sea captain. By 1791 he was master of "Deux Sœurs". Two years later, he was master of the brig "Succès". During this period he transported slaves from Africa to the Indian Ocean colonies of Île de France and Île Bourbon (Réunion).
Privateer.
In 1793 the French Revolutionary Wars broke out, and with them a battle in the Indian Ocean between Britain and France. In 1794 the British captured him and his brig "Olivette" when the British entered Mahé, Seychelles, capturing the colony. The now British colony retained "Olivette" for its government's purposes.
In June 1794 he married the 16-year old Mairie Corantine Olivette Jorre de St Jorre, daughter of a wealthy local merchant, shortly after he had started his privateering adventures.
In 1796 Hodoul went to sea again as an "enseigne de vaisseau" aboard the privateer "Entreprise". Then he sailed aboard "Général Pichegru", a recently captured British schooner previously named "Hay", that Captain François Legars of "Enterprise" had given Jacques François Perroud. Hodoul sailed with Perroud to India. On 17 February 1797 Hodoul arrived at Port Louis with the British vessel "Castor", of 150 tons (bm), which Perroud and "Général Pichegru" had captured in January at Visakhapatnam. She had a cargo of wheat and rice.
In May Hodoul received his first privateer command, "Apollon", of ten guns and six "obusier"s. He sailed on 7 March with 71 men from Port-Louis for the Malabar Coast. There he captured the ship "Eliza", of three masts and 350 tons (bm), herself a former French vessel. Six days later he rescued seven slaves aboard a British vessel whose crew had abandoned it after a storm. A few days later, on 17 May, near Masulipatnam, he captured "Aydresev", a ship of about 500 tons, sailing under the Maharatta flag. She arrived at Port-Louis on 23 June. The captain of the prize crew, Harel, reported that on 3 May Hodoul had captured a British vessel bound for Tranquebar, then a Danish colony.
On 20 May Hodoul was at Koringa, where he captured "Macré" (or "Macoroy", or "Macroy"). Her crew escaped in a "chaloupe", with Hodoul in pursuit. They landed on a beach and fled inland, abandoning a chest full of pearls.
"Maraq", a prize to "Apollon", arrived at Port-Louis on 14 July. The captain of the prize crew was Etienne Dupeyré.
On 15 September Hodoul captured "Bader Bux" as she sailed from Moka towards Surat. She turned out to be his most valuable prize as she was carrying 3732 gold ecus, some piastres, 296 gold sequins, and a quantity of pearls. On 30 October, while sailing back to Mauritius, Hodoul captured "Laurel", Fuggo, master. Hodoul's crew was so reduced because of the need to deploy prize crews that he put "Laurel"s crew in irons. On 9 November he captured two vessels of the British East India Company's Bengal Pilot Service: "Trayalle" (), and . The schooner "Harrington" arrived at Port Louis on 21 December. The captain of the prize crew was Nicholas Montalent.
Hodoul and "Apollon" returned to Port Louis on 7 January 1798. He had with him 57 prisoners and 50-60,000 piastres from the "Rey", which he had captured off Bengal and then abandoned. On 18 January "Loret" (probably "Laurel"), of 400 tons, which "Apollon" had also captured off Bengal, too arrived at Port-Louis.
The total value of the prizes from Hodoul's cruise on " Apollon" was 703,479,803 francs.
Hodoul sold his half-share in "Apollon" to the corsair Le Vaillant. Le Vaillant left Mauritius on 22 August 1798 and captured a valuable Portuguese vessel. However, on 10 November (French records), or 24 October (British records), captured "Apollon" off Mombasa and carried her crew to the Comoro Islands.
In June 1799 Marie Corantine Olivette gave birth to a son, Raymond. On 28 November the privateer "Général Malartic", Jean-Marie Dutertre, master, captured the British vessel "Surprise" near Madras. He took "Surprize"s crew to the Seychelles from where Hodoul, in "Success", took them to Mauritius; they arrived on 28 January 1800.
Hodoul next purchased "Uni", a large vessel armed with eighteen 4-pounder and four 9-pounder guns. She had come from Nantes in 1798 and already had two cruises to her credit, both under the command of François-Thomas Le Même. Hodoul sailed on 15 May 1800 with a crew of 220 men. He reached the Seychelles on the 28th. Off Ste. Anne he captured the British privateer "Henriette" (or "Harriot", from Cape Town), of eight guns under the command of Captain White. On 11 July Hodoul captured "Helen", which was carrying 80,000 piastres. Then on 4 August he captured "Friendship". However, on 5 August captured "Uni" and Hodoul after a chase during which Hodoul had almost all of "Uni"s guns thrown overboard in an attempt to lighten her to gain speed. Captain Edward O. Osborne, of "Arrogant", reported that "Uni" had left Mauritius with 250 men, and that she had 216 on board when captured, the rest being away on prizes.
When the British first sighted "Uni" she had been in company with another ship, and a brig. Osborne set out after the ship, which turned out to be "Friendship", and which he recaptured early that night. The brig escaped; she was the "Bee", from Madras sailing to Masulipatnam. Hodoul had captured both "Friendship" and "Bee" that morning.
The British took their prizes to Madras, where they arrived on 17 August. From there the British transferred Hodoul to Fort William (Calcutta). Hodoul remained a prisoner until the Treaty of Amiens (1802), ended hostilities.
After his release Hodoul settled on Mahe Island of the Seychelles. Here he became a wealthy businessman and plantation owner in the Seychelles, where he introduced cacao cultivation. He was particularly successful in the sugar and rum industries, and in cotton and coffee growing. He did not fully leave the sea as he built and owned several small ships that traded between the Seychelles and Mauritius. He also built the Petit Port and Le Grand Chantier at Mahé.
Hodoul was a man of even-handedness, especially to his daughters and sons in law, and very kind to his slaves. In July 1837 Hodoul's widow received a compensation of at least £7,171 for the liberation of at least 216 slaves who formed part of his estate.
At his wife's behest, Hodoul employed the exiled Jacobin architect Antoine Jean-Baptise Le Franc to build Château Mammelles, which is now the oldest building in the Seychelles. The British Authorities later used Hodoul's second large house, Ma Constance, to house the exiled Sultan of Perak.
Fate.
Hodoul died at Mahé on 10 January 1835. His tomb bears the inscription "Il fut juste".
Legacy.
Today in the harbor of Victoria, there is a small islet named Hodoul Island in his honor. Legend has it that Hodoul's treasure is buried on Silhouette Island, northwest of Mahé.

No Greater Love (Only Fools and Horses)

"No Greater Love" is an episode of the BBC sitcom "Only Fools and Horses". It was the fourth episode of series 2, and was first screened on 11 November 1982.
Synopsis.
The Trotters arrive at a London street with camel hair overcoats, and plan to receive payments from Mrs Singh. But when Rodney opens the door to her house, he meets another woman named Irene Mackay, who tells him that Mrs Singh moved away three weeks earlier.
Rodney enters Irene's flat and is instantly smitten with her. Irene tells Rodney she is aged 40, and married with a teenage son Marcus. She also mentions her husband Tommy Mackay, who is "away working, but will be out in six months". He is actually imprisoned in Parkhurst for committing assault, GBH, and attempted murder.
One week later at Nelson Mandela House, Rodney tells Del Boy and Grandad about Irene, and how she moved away from her husband due to domestic violence. Rodney wants to meet Tommy in person when he is released from prison. This makes Del concerned for his younger brother's safety.
A few days later, at "The Nag's Head", Rodney tells Del that he and Irene had broken up earlier in the day. Del consoles Rodney and tells him there are plenty of other women to talk to. But then, Irene's son Marcus enters and tells Rodney that Del told Irene over a drink to break up with Rodney. Rodney, feeling betrayed by Del, leaves.
Later that night, Del is dragged into a dark alley by a thug and confronted by Tommy Mackay, mistakenly believing Del to be Rodney (Del goes along with the mistaken identity to protect Rodney, since he would stand no chance against the intimidating Tommy). Tommy prepares to give him a beating for dating Irene. They let Del take his coat off, but he accidentally throws it into a puddle. Furious that his new coat has been ruined, Del lunges at Tommy, and despite sustaining a few moderate injuries, Del manages to win the fight and limps back to the Nag's Head.
Back at the Nag's Head, Del shows Rodney his injuries, but lies and claims he sustained them from falling down the stairs at Monkey Harris' home (despite Harris living in a bungalow). Del also mentions to Rodney that he met Tommy Mackay and made him see the error of his ways, which means Rodney and Irene can date with no threat from Tommy. But Rodney says he had an earlier talk with Irene and they agreed their relationship was never going to work anyway. Plus, Rodney has met another girl, Zoe, from the roller-disco. Zoe arrives, she and Rodney leave, and Del is left alone in the pub, annoyed but happy that he has protected his brother.
Episode concept.
The idea for the script was to demonstrate the brotherly love that Del and Rodney have for each other, even willing to take a beating for his brother. The concept of Del getting beaten up in order to protect Rodney would occur again in "Little Problems" when Del, unbeknownst to Rodney, chooses to take a beating from the Driscoll Brothers after making a promise to him, having forgotten that the money he would use for his wedding gift was also the money which he owed to them.

Tuchyn

Tuchyn (, , , ) is an urban-type settlement in the Rivne Oblast (province) of western Ukraine. It is located in the Rivne Raion (district) in the historic region of Volhynia, approximately 18 km east from the oblast capital, Rivne.
History.
The Polish noble family Siemaszko is rooted in Tuchyn. In 1650, the town was owned by the Daniłłowicz family, then later by the Lubomirski's, and finally by the Walewski's from the 18th century to the outbreak of World War II. The Stanisław Lubomirski foundation erected two wooden churches, "cerkwie", in the town in 1711 (Paraskewy) and 1730 (Przemienienia Pańskiego). The Walewski's built a classicist Church in 1796.
A Roman Catholic Parish was founded in Tuczyn in 1590, it included many villages of the surrounding region. In 1938, the Catholic parish numbered 2,660 individuals, almost all of them Poles.
There was a significant German population in the Tuczyn region. They began to arrive in large numbers in the 1860s. The vast majority were German Lutherans, initially served from distant Zhitomir Lutheran Parish. The Lutheran Parish of Tuczyn was established there in 1888. At its peak, prior to World War I, the parish served over 25,000 Germans in more than 80 villages in a region much larger than that covered by the Catholic parish - yet no church building was constructed until 1929. The number of Germans dropped dramatically right before World War I, when many migrated to North America. Only some 6000 or so remained during the inter-war years.
Prior to World War II Tuchyn was a major town in the district and had a large population of Jewish (about 3000), Polish and Ukrainian ethnicity, plus the remnants of the once numerous German population.
Second World War.
After hearing of the annihilation of the Jewish ghetto in Rivne, the Jewish leaders decided that they would resist the Nazis. On the evening of Wednesday, September 23, 1942, a blockade was mounted against the ghetto of Tuczyn. The leaders of the uprising declared a full alert; the fighting groups took up positions. On the dawn of September 24, German forces and Ukrainian auxiliaries advanced toward the ghetto fences. When the resistance forces gave the signal, the buildings of the ghetto and the German warehouses at its edge were set ablaze. The fighting groups opened fire, broke through the ghetto fence, and urged the population to escape. Under cover of smoke and gunfire, some 2,000 people—about two-thirds of the ghetto population, including women, children, and the elderly—fled into the forest. The flames continued to burn for the rest of that day and part of the next; the gunfire continued as well. Several Germans and Ukrainian auxiliary police were killed. One-third of the ghetto population fell, including almost all the fighters. The uprising ended on Saturday, September 26 when the lead resisters turned themselves into the Germans, unable to withstand the conditions in the nearby forests. The escapees fared very badly. Half of them were captured and murdered within three days. About 300 women, clutching infants, unable to withstand the conditions of the forest, returned to Tuczyn and were shot. Many of the remainder died; others were turned in or murdered by peasants in the vicinity. Some young people joined the partisans and were killed in combat. Of the 3,000 Jews of Tuczyn, only 20 were still alive on January 16, 1944, when the town was liberated.

Zebra bullhead shark

The zebra bullhead shark ("Heterodontus zebra") is a bullhead shark of the family Heterodontidae found in the central Indo-Pacific between latitudes 40°N and 20°S, from Japan and Korea to Australia. It is typically found at relatively shallow depths down to , but off Western Australia, it occurs between . It can reach a length of . The reproduction of this bullhead shark is oviparous.
Description.
The zebra bullhead shark is a member of the bullhead and horn shark family, the Heterodontidae. This organism is occasionally been referred to as the zebra horn shark, striped bullhead shark, and the zebra Port Jackson shark. These sharks receive their name due to their bull-like appearance because of the heavy brown bones present over each eye. The taxon of the zebra bullhead shark is small but has had a fossil record that has been traced back closely to the beginning of the Mesozoic era. This species was classified first in the genus "Squalus" which is also known as the Linnaean shark. The Linnaean shark is known to be a bottom dwelling shark which is similar to the Bullhead shark family.
The zebra bullhead shark is of minimal interest to commercial fisheries and game fishing. However, due to the unique and attractive color pattern of these sharks they are a part of the aquarium trade around the world. These organisms are known to be carnivores and feed on a range of organisms including sea urchins and crustaceans. The prey they feed on can be found in rocky reefs and kelp forests where zebra bullhead sharks live. The range of these organisms within the marine habitat is from 50 meters to 200 meters. Zebra bullhead sharks are known to not have many natural predators where they live. However, in rare cases, larger sharks and human can be a threat to these organisms.
Appearance.
The zebra bullhead shark's body shape is slim, oval shaped, and ray-like. The snouts on these sharks is short and rounded without the presence of lateral teeth. The eyes are dorsolateral on the head with crests above the eyes. The appearance of the "Heterodontus zebra" from an external view involves the presence of a dorsal fin and anal fin. The dorsal fin on these sharks has a spine within it. The length of the dorsal fin is about 21 to 27% of the total organisms length. The first dorsal fin is high in the juvenile sharks, while in the adult sharks the first dorsal fin is moderately high. The color of the dorsal surface is a range between white and cream depending on the shark. There are five large gill openings slightly in front of pectoral-fin mid-bases on the side of these sharks heads. Out of the five gill slits, the first gill slit is the largest and is closest to the front of the body. The smallest gill slit is the most posterior out of the five gill slits. Along with this, these organisms have a range of large to small vertical markings from the snout to the caudal fin of brown and black color. Depending on size, "Heterodontus zebra" between 64 and 122 cm has about 22 to 36 brown or black markings. The fins on this organism typically have black tips or white dorsal-fin apices.
Size.
The maximum total length of the "Heterodontus zebra" is 122 cm which is roughly four feet. The hatchlings of this species are at least 15 cm at birth. Males mature between 64 and 84 cm, while females mature at 122 cm.
Life history.
The zebra bullhead shark's reproduction system is oviparous. Oviparous reproduction is the process of producing organisms by the hatching or laying eggs by a parent. A female shark lays two eggs at a time during the spring to the later summer near the coast of Japan. The typical seasonal spawning pattern of the female shark is six to twelve times during a single mating season. The eggs are normally laid in rocks or fields of kelp. When eggs are hatched, the embryos feed on the yolk and hatch a year after they have been produced. The typical size of these hatchlings is 18 cm. The process of reproduction begins with a male grasping the pectoral fin of a female. The male inserts a single clasper into a female's cloaca.
Human impact.
The zebra bullhead sharks are characterized by slow growth which makes it difficult to cultivate them in the laboratory. Due to the slow growth and reproductivity that characterize these organisms human can have an impact. These organisms are important to humans in various ways including the aquarium trade, the study of marine ecology, and the impact these organisms have on other species. Conservation efforts have been put in place to limit the impact of humans on the zebra bullhead sharks. Laws have been put in place on the coasts of Asia in order to protect this species and its closest relatives. Although the zebra bullhead shark is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN's Red list there is little information provided to fully understand the impact humans are having on these organisms.

Tara (Israel)

Tara () is an agricultural cooperative (co-op) in Israel specializing in milk and dairy products. It is the second largest dairy processor after Tnuva.
History.
Tara was created in 1942 by dairy farmers from the Tel Aviv neighbourhood of Nahalat Yitzhak and the surrounding area, in order to unite under one organization that would represent them with regard to the British mandatory authorities and concentrated purchasing of fodder rations as well as selling the agricultural produce. The name apparently was decided by the British clerk when the co-op representative came to register the firm did not have a name. A warehouse for fodder as well as a refrigeration room to keep milk on the Shabbat was built on a half-dunam (500 m²) plot of land. The increase in productivity as well as quantities of milk provided a surplus that led the co-op to begin producing cream and cheeses. 
With the establishment of the State of Israel, a dairy department was created in the new Ministry of Agriculture, and with it new regulations with regard to production including required pasteurization, a standard 3.5% level of fat, and that dairy farmers work from concentrated areas and independently. This led to more dairy farmers to join from Giv'atayim, Jaffa, and Petah Tikva as well as production expanding to hard cheeses.
At the beginning of the 1960s, during the period that Moshe Dayan was Minister of Agriculture, the government decided to change the zoning of the Nahalat Yitzhak neighbourhood from agricultural to urban-industrial. Subsequently, the local farmers were forced to move their enterprises elsewhere. The elimination of its main source of milk required Tara to purchase milk from new farmers as well as Tnuva.
Until the late 1990s, Tara was still run by representatives of the original owners. In 1997, it was decided to hire 'professional' management. In 2004, the Central Bottling Company Ltd., the local licensee of Coca-Cola, purchased the company for $39 million.
In 2006, Tara signed a licensing and know-how deal with Müller of a European dairy product manufacturer based in Germany.
As of 2006, Tara employs over 360 workers and produces about 135 million liters of milk yearly, which is about 450,000 liters of milk daily on average, with a market share of 10-13%. Estimated revenues in 2005 were 500 million NIS, with a loss of about $10 million.
In August 2007, the "Gilead Dairy" owned by Tara, acquired "Tzuriel Farm" for under NIS 20 million. The 'Tzuriel Farm' dairy, specializing in hard-cheese, goat-cheeses, and other semi-firm cheeses was established in 1986 and since 1999 has operated a unique line of soy-based products.

Rivers Access Campaign

The Rivers Access Campaign is an ongoing initiative by the British Canoe Union (BCU) to open up the inland waterways of England and Wales to the public. Under current English and Welsh law, public access to rivers is restricted, and only 2% of all rivers in England and Wales have public access rights.
Current access situation.
There are of inland river and canal in England and Wales with navigation rights, and over of inland rivers with no access.
England and Wales are unusual in the level of restriction upon their waterways and are considered two of the most difficult places in the world to gain access to rivers. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 grants a "Right to Roam" specifically to areas of open land comprising:
In England and Wales there is no blanket right of access to non-agricultural land, unlike Scotland, where the Scottish Parliament passed the 2003 Land Reform (Scotland) Act granting access for both land and inland waterways to the public.
The UK government has encouraged canoeists to negotiate access agreements with landowners for privately owned waterways in England and Wales. For more than 50 years, both the BCU and WCA have worked to secure such agreements, resulting in 812 kilometres (505 mi)—about 4% of all privately owned linear waterways in England and Wales—being opened to some form of public access.
The Welsh Canoeing Association estimate that there are around 300 rivers in Wales suitable for kayaking, only 13 of which have any form of legal access agreement.
Most of these agreements permit access only on certain days of the year or for short sections of the river. The government has decided to pursue further agreements in 4 study areas, over a 2-year trial period. However, there is no guarantee that this trial will grant further access, with recent government studies showing that access agreements are unlikely to be able to provide the necessary resources needed for water sports.
The law.
Legally the water itself is not owned, but ownership of the lands include stream bed ownership. Under common law, the presence of water does not provide a right to use the space occupied by, or immediately above the water. This is a civil offence , and may incur a fine or possibly a court injunction to prevent further trespassing.

Orange City Fire Department

The Orange Fire Department (OFD) provides fire protection and emergency medical services for the city of Orange, California. The department is responsible for a population of approximately 140,000 people spread across . Along with their standard firefighting apparatus, the department also has a Swiftwater rescue team that is available for deployment anywhere in Orange County.
History.
The Orange City Fire Department came into existence on December 14, 1905 at a meeting between the city's Fire and Water Committees. Twenty-nine men signed up to join the all volunteer fire department. New volunteers were required to purchase shares of the "Company" for $100. The volunteers were paid 50 cents a call if they didn't have to use water, $1 if they did and were also paid $1 per false alarm. Early on, there were often fights between the volunteers when an alarm went off, as they battled to see which would be the ones to pull the ladder wagon or hose cart to the fire, thus earning the pay for the call.
In 1906, the volunteers repurposed an 1874 building that had been moved rearward off Glassell Street in 1905, during construction of the Edwards Block Building. That old building would serve as the volunteers first fire hall from 1906 to 1910 and was located in the northeast corner of Plaza Square. The little fire hall had a 30-foot tower with a fire bell adjacent to the building to sound fire alarms. The original apparatus was a hand-drawn hook and ladder wagon and two-hand drawn carts. In July 1910 the volunteers moved to their first purpose-built fire station at 122 south Olive Street. The total cost of the new fire station was $465, including lumber, plumbing, fixtures and nails. It wasn't until 1912 that the department acquired its first motor-driven equipment, a Seagrave fire truck and chemical engine. The first paid firefighter, William Vickers, was hired by the Department in 1914 and he lived upstairs at the fire hall for an $8-a-month rent. This Fire Hall acted as OFD's headquarters until March 1935, when the department moved into another facility across the street on Olive. Incidentally, that 1935 facility eventually burned down.
An American LaFrance fire truck capable of pumping 1,000 gallons a minute was purchased for $13,000 in 1921, making the Orange Fire Department the first firefighting agency in Orange County to purchase and utilize a motorized fire engine.
By 1966 the department had fully transitioned from a volunteer department, to full-time career.
In 1973, the department became one of the first in Orange County to provide paramedic rescue service.
On October 6, 2022, the Grand Opening of the department's latest headquarters was held at 1176 East Chapman Avenue. The structure sits on a 1.5 acre, city-owned site on East Chapman Avenue at Water Street. The new building replaces a 50-year-old fire headquarters at 176 south Grand Street. The new facility provides for increased administrative and training space, as well as increased room for fire apparatus. The total cost of the project, including design, construction, and outfitting, is estimated at 24.9 million USD$.
Stations and apparatus.
The department has 8 stations spread across the city. There are 2 Engine Companies at Stations 1 and 7.
Metro Cities Fire Authority.
The Orange City Fire Department is part of the Metro Cities Fire Authority which provides emergency communications for multiple departments in and around Orange County. The call center, known as Metro Net Fire Dispatch, is located in Anaheim and provides 9-1-1 fire and EMS dispatch to over 1.2 million residents covering an area of . Other departments included in Metro Net include Anaheim Fire &amp; Rescue, Brea Fire Department, Fountain Valley, Fullerton Fire Department, Huntington Beach Fire Department, and Newport Beach Fire Department.

Arlene Croce

Arlene Louise Croce (; May 5, 1934 – December 16, 2024) was an American dance critic. She co-founded "Ballet Review" magazine in 1965 and served as its first editor. From 1973 to 1996 she was a dance critic for "The New Yorker" magazine.
Background.
Croce was born to an Italian-American family in Providence, Rhode Island, on May 5, 1934. She later grew up in Asheville, North Carolina, after her family moved there, and studied at the Woman's College of the University of North Carolina, before graduating from New York's Barnard College in 1955. 
Career.
Prior to Croce's long career as a dance writer, she also wrote film criticism for "Film Culture" and other magazines. In 1965, she was one of the founders of "Ballet Review". She joined "The New Yorker" in 1973. The keynote of her criticism can be grasped from her ability to evoke kinesthetic movement and expressive images in her writing. Although she considered ballet to epitomize the highest form of dance, she also wrote extensively on the topic of popular and filmed dance, and was a recognized authority on the Astaire and Rogers musical films.
In 1994, she courted controversy with her stance on Bill T. Jones's "Still/Here", a work about terminal illness. In an article called "Discussing the Undiscussable", she dubbed the work "victim art" and refused to attend any performances, claiming that it was "unreviewable" because Jones featured commentary from actual terminal patients in the performance. The article became highly controversial, with numerous writers and artists publicly defending or rebuking Croce. The article was reprinted in her 2000 book, "Writing in the Dark".
Her writings on dance are available in several books, and a sampling of her film criticism can be found in the anthology "American Movie Critics:" "An Anthology From the Silents Until Now".
Death.
Croce died from complications of a stroke at a care facility in Johnston, Rhode Island, on December 16, 2024, at age 90.

Bob Jane

Robert Frederick Jane (18 December 1929 – 28 September 2018) was an Australian race car driver and prominent entrepreneur and business tycoon. A four-time winner of the Armstrong 500, the race that became the prestigious Bathurst 1000 and a four-time Australian Touring Car Champion, Jane was well known for his chain of tyre retailers, Bob Jane T-Marts. Jane was inducted into the V8 Supercars Hall of Fame in 2000.
Early life.
Bob Jane grew up in Brunswick, an inner-city suburb of Melbourne. His passion for racing began in the early 1950s as a champion bicycle rider, holding many state records before turning to four wheels. In the later 1950s, he started Bob Jane Autoland, a company that distributed parts for Jaguar and Alfa Romeo. Through this venture, a love of cars and motor sport blossomed and he first entered competitive racing in Australia in 1956; by 1960, he was racing with some of Australia's top sedan drivers.
Racing career.
In 1961, Jane and co-driver Harry Firth won the Armstrong 500 at Phillip Island, Victoria, driving a Mercedes-Benz 220SE. Jane and Firth, driving a Ford Falcon XL, won the race again the following year, the last before the event moved to Mount Panorama at Bathurst, New South Wales, retaining the Armstrong 500 name. Jane, driving for the Ford works team, won a further two Armstrong 500s at the new venue, the first with Firth in 1963 and the second in 1964 with George Reynolds as co-driver. Despite the change of venue, Jane is officially credited with winning Australia's most famous endurance race four times in a row, something no other driver, not even nine-time race winner Peter Brock, has ever done.
Jane won the Australian Touring Car Championship (now known as the V8 Supercars Championship) in 1962, 1963, 1971 and 1972. His 1971 ATCC win was in a Chevrolet Camaro ZL-1 with a 427 cubic inch engine. Jane was forced by a rule change to replace the 427 engine with a 350 cubic inch engine for the 1972 championship but the Camaro still managed to beat the opposition, which included Allan Moffat's Ford Boss 302 Mustang, Ian Geoghegan's Ford XY Falcon GTHO Phase III, and Norm Beechey's Holden HT Monaro GTS350. Of the 38 races he started in the ATCC, he finished on the podium 21 times.
Jane also won the 1963 Australian GT Championship at the wheel of a Jaguar E-type, and the Marlboro Sports Sedan Series, in both 1974 and 1975, at his own Calder Park Raceway driving a Holden Monaro GTS 350 (at times he also drove his Repco V8 powered Holden LJ Torana GTR XU-1 which was mostly driven by John Harvey).
Jane retired from competitive motor racing at the end of 1981 due to sciatica. At the time of his retirement he had been driving a 6.0 litre Chevrolet Monza in the Australian Sports Sedan Championship. After giving up driving, Jane asked touring car star Peter Brock to drive the Monza in the re-formed Australian GT Championship. Brock raced the car in 1982 and 1983 before Jane sold the car in early 1984 to Re-Car owner Allan Browne.
Bob Jane T-Marts.
In 1965, Jane opened the first Bob Jane T-Marts store in Melbourne. The company remains an independent, family-owned business to this day; Bob's son, Rodney Jane, is the current CEO. In 2011, 81-year-old Jane resigned as chairman of T-Marts citing difficulties in the relationship with his son Rodney.
From 1984 To 1997 Bob Jane formed a cross shareholding partnership with Ian Diffen. Bob Jane operated in Queensland and Ian Richard Diffen operated Ian Diffen's World of Tyres and Mufflers in Western Australia.
From 2002 to 2004, Bob Jane T-Marts held the naming rights sponsorship for the Bathurst 1000, the race Jane dominated early in his career. The company also held the naming rights to the former Bob Jane Stadium, home of South Melbourne FC.
Bob Jane T-Marts is the only major tyre retailer in Australia who do not sell retread tyres. Jane's personal reason for this is that his second eldest daughter Georgina had died in a car accident in 1991 due to a retreaded tyre blowing out.
Having lost control of Bob Jane T-Marts, Jane attempted to create a new tyre business using his name. It was blocked by son Rodney in court which also ruled Jane pay legal costs. In May 2015, his Diggers Rest farm was seized by the state sheriff in order to settle the outstanding costs.
Contributions to Australian motorsport.
Australian Grand Prix.
From 1980 to 1984, the Australian Grand Prix was held at his Calder Park Raceway in the outer suburbs of Melbourne, Jane taking over the promoting and staging of the Grand Prix in the hope of Calder Park being granted a round of the Formula One World Championship (an ambitious plan at best as Calder was a 1.6 km long circuit which the faster cars lapped in less than 40 seconds). The 1980 Grand Prix was open to Formula 5000, Formula Pacific and Formula One cars and was won by Australia's 1980 Formula One World Champion Alan Jones driving his World Championship winning Williams FW07B-Ford. Second home was fellow F1 driver Bruno Giacomelli driving his Alfa Romeo 179, with Ligier F1 driver Didier Pironi finishing 3rd, driving an Elfin MR8 Formula 5000 for leading Australian team Ansett Team Elfin.
From 1981 until 1984 the races were run under Formula Mondial regulations and Jane succeeded in attracting many of the best Formula One drivers of the era. Each race from 1981 to 1984 was won by those driving the popular Ralt RT4-Ford.
The 1981 Australian Grand Prix was won by future F1 driver Roberto Moreno from Brazil. Finishing second, also in an RT4 was 1981 World Champion Nelson Piquet (Brazil) with Australian Geoff Brabham finishing 3rd in his RT4. Alan Jones and Ligier's Jacques Laffite also participated in the race, though both failed to finish. The 1981 race was the first time since 1968 that the AGP had two or more, current or past World Champions, on the starting grid. On that occasion, Jim Clark (1st), Graham Hill (3rd), Denny Hulme (9th), and Australia's own triple World Champion Jack Brabham (DNF) participated as the race was part of the popular off-season Tasman Series.
For the 1982 Australian Grand Prix, Jane again attracted F1 drivers in Piquet, Laffite, the then retired Jones, plus future Formula One World Champion Alain Prost. Frenchman Prost won the 100 lap race from Laffite and 1981 winner Roberto Moreno. When Prost later won his second AGP in Adelaide in 1986 to win his second of four Formula One World Championships, he became the only driver to ever win the Australian Grand Prix in both World Championship and non-championship formats.
The 1983 race, while only attracting one current F1 driver in Jacques Laffite, as well as Alan Jones, who had made an abortive F1 comeback earlier in the year, did attract 24 entries (mostly the Ford powered RT4), including former winner Moreno, Geoff Brabham and future F1 driver Allen Berg. Moreno won his second AGP from local drivers John Smith and Laffite. Geoff Brabham finished 4th with Jones in 5th and Charlie O'Brien. Reigning Australian Drivers' Champion Alfredo Costanzo led the race early in his Tiga FA81 before suffering a differential failure on lap 25. Moreno would later claim that had 'Alfie' not retired then he would likely have won as he didn't believe he would have caught the Australian. The 1983 race was the last time the Grand Prix was included as a round of the Australian Drivers' Championship.
During 1984 it was announced that from 1985, the Australian Grand Prix would be held on the Streets of Adelaide and would be the 16th and final round of the 1985 Formula One season, giving the Grand Prix "World Championship" status for the first time in its history. Despite this, Jane was still able to successfully attract current Formula One drivers to participate in the 1984 Australian Grand Prix. Headlining the 'imports' was three time (including 1984) World Champion Niki Lauda, and 1982 World Champion Keke Rosberg. Joining them were 1984 Ligier drivers Andrea de Cesaris and François Hesnault and 1981 and 1983 AGP winner Roberto Moreno to face off against local stars Costanzo and 1984 Gold Star champion John Bowe. Moreno would win his 3rd AGP in 4 years from Rosberg, who fought back from a bad start and a collision another car, with de Cesaris putting in the drive of the race to finish 3rd after starting early from the pit lane and being almost half a lap down when he took the green flag.
NASCAR.
Jane is credited with bringing stock car racing to Australia. Long resistant to oval racing (seeing it as dull and monotonous when compared to circuit racing, although speedway (Dirt track racing), held on smaller ¼ or ⅓ mile oval tracks, has been popular in Australia since the 1920s), Australian motorsport fans finally had their own NASCAR-style high banked superspeedway when Jane spent A$54 million building the Thunderdome on the grounds of Calder Park Raceway. The 1.801 km (1.119 mi) Thunderdome, with 24° banking in the turns, was built as a quad-oval with Jane modelling the track on the famous Charlotte Motor Speedway.
Opened on 3 August 1987, the Thunderdome played host to the first ever NASCAR event held outside North America on 28 February 1988 with the Goodyear NASCAR 500. Several prominent drivers from the United States came to Australia for this race including Alabama Gang members Bobby Allison and Neil Bonnett, along with Kyle Petty, Michael Waltrip, Dave Marcis, and others from the Winston West Series. Bonnett, who had won the Winston Cup's Pontiac Excitement 400 at the Richmond International Raceway the previous weekend, and Allison, who had won the 1988 Daytona 500 just one week prior to that, dominated the race, swapping the lead several times on a hot summer afternoon in which cabin temperatures were reported to reach over 57 °C (135 °F). Bonnett won the 280 lap race from Allison with Dave Marcis finishing 3rd.
The race was marred by an early multi-car crash in turns 3 and 4 involving 8 cars including the Ford Thunderbird of local touring car champion Dick Johnson, and the Oldsmobile of Allan Grice who, after running out of brakes, couldn't slow down coming off the back straight and ran into the wreck at speed. Grice, whose car was a write-off, suffered a broken collarbone and was taken to hospital for x-rays.
Jane also owned the Adelaide International Raceway which features the only other paved NASCAR type oval in Australia with its half mile Speedway Super Bowl, which, unlike the Thunderdome, is a permanent part of the road circuit.
In 1992, Jane and Sydney based speedway promoter and Channel 7 television commentator Mike Raymond also announced plans to turn the old half mile harness racing track that surrounded the Parramatta Speedway in Sydney into a paved oval for NASCAR and the Australian AUSCAR category, giving Australia a third paved oval speedway. However, the project never got past the planning stage.
Personal life.
On 23 February 2007, Jane was granted a 12-month intervention order against his estranged wife, Laree Jane (born 1967). At the time, she was 39 years old and they had been married for 20 years. He accused her of threatening to shoot him and threatening him with a kitchen knife. In a Victorian County Court, on 22 January 2009, a jury found Laree Jane not guilty of five charges, including assault, related to the domestic dispute.
Jane met Laree when he performed Grand Marshal duties for the 1986 James Hardie 1000 at Bathurst.
Jane declared bankruptcy on 8 July 2016.
On 28 September 2018, Jane died from prostate cancer, 21 years after his diagnosis. He was 88.

Ghost from a Perfect Place

Ghost from a Perfect Place is a two act play by Philip Ridley. It was Ridley's third stage play and premiered at the Hampstead Theatre, London on 7 April 1994. The part of Travis Flood was played by the veteran, classical actor John Wood, for which he received general acclaim and was nominated for 'Best Actor' at the 1994 Evening Standard Drama Awards. The production was the third collaboration between Ridley and director Matthew Lloyd, who had directed all of Ridley's previous stage plays and would go on to direct Ridley's next play for adults "Vincent River" in 2000.
The play is the third and final instalment in Ridley's unofficially titled "East End Gothic Trilogy", having been preceded by "The Pitchfork Disney" and "The Fastest Clock In The Universe".
The play caused a great deal of controversy at its premiere due to a scene where an old East London gangster, played by Wood, is tortured by a gang of girls. The theatre critic of "The Guardian", Michael Billington, described the play as "degrading and quasi-pornographic." As with most of Ridley's work, however, the critical response was deeply divided, with Sheridan Morley describing it as "a masterpiece" and John Peter, of "The Sunday Times", declaring, "Ridley's work is an acquired taste and it looks like I'm getting it."
The play along with Ridley's "The Pitchfork Disney" and "The Fastest Clock In The Universe" grew in reputation years after their initial productions for being seminal works in the development of in-yer-face theatre. The terminology for this theatrical sensibility and style was popularised by Aleks Sierz in his 2001 book "In-Yer-Face Theatre: British Drama Today", which also features a section that analyses "Ghost from a Perfect Place" and its initial reception. Sierz has also cited the play as one of the first to be indirectly called "in-yer-face" by a critic, with Paul Taylor in his review for "The Independent" describing the girl gang in the play as "the in-yer-face castrating trio".
Characters.
Torchie Sparks – Seventy six years old, her leg has been severely damaged for many years as result of a fire which burnt through her flat. She has had to endure many tragic events in her life but maintains a sense of humour about her misfortune. She is very nostalgic towards life in London's East-End during the 1960s which she refers to as “the heydays”.
Travis Flood – Seventy eight years of age. Travis was once a feared gang leader who lived and operated in Bethnal Green during the 1960s. He has been away from London for 25 years but has decided to return to the East-End.
Rio Sparks – Aged twenty-five, she is a prostitute and leader of a girl-gang called ‘The Disciples’. She lives with her grandmother Torchie.
Miss Sulphur - Aged seventeen, she is a member of ‘The Disciples’. She often tries to keep the peace between members of the gang.

Vincent River (play)

Vincent River is a one act stage play by Philip Ridley. It was Ridley's fourth stage play and premiered at the Hampstead Theatre, London on 6 September 2000. The production was the last major collaboration between Ridley and director Mathew Lloyd, who had previously directed the majority of Ridley's other theatrical works.
Plot.
The story plays out in realtime and is set in a rundown flat in Dagenham.
A woman called Anita is moving in following the death of Vincent, her son who was killed in a homophobic attack, which resulted in her discovering that he was a homosexual.
In the play, she interacts with Davey, a boy who claims to have been the first to find Vincent's corpse and who wants to know as much as he can about Vincent from Anita.
On film.
In 2005 Marianne Epin and Cyrille Thouvenin starred in the play at the Théâtre du Marais in Paris, which was also filmed and released as a television movie. It is available on region 2 DVD.
The play has been compared to the 2014 film "Lilting", starring Ben Whishaw, Cheng Pei Pei and Andrew Leung and written and directed by Hong Khaou. The story, similar to the play, is about a man who approaches the mother of his deceased gay lover to try and connect and understand their loss.

HMS E3

HMS "E3" was the third E-class submarine to be constructed, built at Barrow by Vickers in 1911–1912. Built with compartmentalisation and endurance not previously achievable, these were the best submarines in the Royal Navy at the start of the First World War. She was sunk in the first ever successful attack on one submarine by another, when she was torpedoed on 18 October 1914 by north of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands.
Design.
The early British E-class submarines, from "E1" to "E8", had a displacement of at the surface and while submerged. They had a length overall of and a beam of , and were powered by two Vickers eight-cylinder two-stroke diesel engines and two electric motors. The class had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of , with a fuel capacity of of diesel affording a range of when travelling at 10 knots, while submerged they had a range of at . Her complement was three officers and 28 ratings.
The early 'Group 1' E-class boats were armed with four 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one in the bow, one either side amidships, and one in the stern; a total of eight torpedoes were carried. Group 1 boats were not fitted with a deck gun during construction, but those involved in the Dardanelles campaign had guns mounted forward of the sail while at Malta Dockyard.
E-class submarines had wireless systems with 1 kW power ratings; in some submarines, these were later upgraded to 3 kW systems by removing a midship torpedo tube. Their maximum design depth was although in service some reached depths of below . Some submarines contained Fessenden oscillator systems.
Service history.
When war was declared with Germany on 5 August 1914, "E3" was based at Harwich, in the 8th Submarine Flotilla of the Home Fleets.
Loss.
"E3" sailed from Harwich on 16 October to patrol off Borkum in the North Sea. On 18 October, she spotted some German destroyers ahead but was unable to get into a position to take a shot at them. Unable to pass them, Commander Cholmley retreated into the bay to wait for them to disperse. As he did so, he failed to see that the bay was also occupied by , under "Kapitänleutnant" Bernd Wegener.
Wegener was surfaced and patrolling between the Ems and Borkum when at 11:25, an object resembling a buoy was spotted where no buoy should be. Suspecting a British submarine, "U-27" immediately dived and closed the object. Although 'conned down', the number 83 was clearly visible on the conning tower of the British boat, now identified as such beyond reasonable doubt. Wegener tracked the submarine for two hours until able to approach 'up sun'. He noted that the look-outs were staring intently in the other direction, towards the Ems. When the distance had closed to , a single torpedo was fired by "U-27". Detonation followed shortly after, and "E3" sank immediately. Survivors were visible in the water but fearing a second British submarine might have been lurking nearby, "U-27" dived and withdrew. 30 minutes later, the U-boat returned to the scene to search for evidence and possible survivors but without success. All 31 members of "E3"s crew were lost.
The wreck.
In October 1990, the stern section was snagged by a fishing boat north of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands, which in turn alerted divers from Zeester. The wreck of "E3" was discovered on 14 October 1994. The stern of "E3" had been blown off in the explosion and was found to be completely detached. The stern section— including the stern torpedo chamber — was later raised. The stern hatch was open, but the nature of the explosion indicates that men in the engine room and motor compartments would have died instantly. The motor and engine rooms are fully exposed and have consequently been looted of all removable fittings, including the bell.
The sail has been removed by fishing nets and the broken periscope standards are still evident. The sail ladder is said to have been donated to the Submarine Museum but is not officially listed within their collections. "E3"s torpedo loading hatch is open and the bow section is largely intact.

Queen Mother Moore

Audley "Queen Mother" Moore (July 27, 1898 – May 2, 1997) was an American civil rights leader and a black nationalist who was friends with such civil rights leaders as Marcus Garvey, Nelson Mandela, Winnie Mandela, Rosa Parks, and Jesse Jackson. She was a figure in the American Civil Rights Movement and a founder of the Republic of New Afrika. Delois Blakely was her assistant for 20 years. Blakely was later enstooled in Ghana as a Nana (Queen Mother).
Early life.
Queen Mother Moore was born Audley Moore in New Iberia, Louisiana, to Ella and St. Cyr Moore on July 27, 1898. Her father, St. Cyr Moore, served as deputy sheriff of Iberia Parish. He would be married three times and fathered eight children. During his marriage to Ella Moore, Queen Mother Moore was the eldest of three, Lorita and Eloise. As children, Moore and her sisters went to Saint Catherine's Catholic school.
Moore's mother died when she was six years old, and she and her sisters were placed in the care of their maternal grandmother. Her grandmother, Nora Henry, had been born into slavery, and when Moore's mother Ella was a child her grandfather was lynched, leaving Ella and her siblings in the care of their mother. Moore and her siblings would later return to the care of their father in New Orleans, but he would pass away when she was in the fourth grade and she would drop out shortly after.
The inheritance intended for Moore and her sisters was claimed by a half-brother that put them out of their home. To support herself and her sisters, Moore took her father's mules to auction and used the money to rent a home. She would later lie about her age in order to become a hairdresser, a position that would support them for some time.  
Their involvement with activism began in their teenage years, with Moore and her sisters mobilizing their neighbors during World War I to provide aid to black recruits upon learning that the Red Cross was only providing sustenance for white soldiers. Her sister Eloise established what could be called the first United Service Organizations in Anniston, Alabama; she found space in an unused building where black soldiers could go to relax, a privilege previously only afforded to white soldiers.
In 1919, Moore learned of Marcus Garvey and went to hear him speak in New Orleans in 1920. By this time, Moore had married and she and her three sisters gained a "new consciousness" of their African heritage after Garvey's speech.
Activism.
After attending a speech by Marcus Garvey, Moore had begun preparing herself to move to Africa with her husband. However, after facing family issues she remained in the United States, moving first to California then to Chicago, before settling in Harlem, New York, with her husband and sisters in 1922.
Moore moved through activist groups often; before joining the Communist Party USA around 1933, Moore joined the International Labor Defense. In the Communist Party, she found a new consciousness of "the society under which we live, an analysis of the system under which we live". Moore worked with the party for some time, but she resigned in 1950, believing the party was no longer working in the best interest of Black people.
After meeting Mary McLeod Bethune in Washington, Moore became a life member of the Council of Negro Women. It was with Bethune that Moore would make the first of many speeches to crowds of those interested in the fight for civil rights.
In 1964, Moore founded the Eloise Moore College of African Studies, Mt. Addis Ababa, in Parksville, New York. The college was destroyed by fire in the late 1970s.
Moore travelled to Africa numerous times between 1972 and 1977. On her first trip to Africa in 1972, she travelled to Guinea for Dr. Kwame Nkrumah's funeral, before being called to Ghana by a chief. In Ghana, she was bestowed with the honorific title "Queen Mother" by the Ashanti in a ceremony. She later returned to Africa for the All-African Women's Conference in Tanzania. She also travelled to Guinea Bissau as the guest of Amilcar Cabral, to Nigeria for the World Festival of Black Arts and Culture, and returned to Tanzania for the Sixth Pan-African Congress in Dar es Salaam, and went to Uganda.
On May 2, 1997, Moore died in a Brooklyn nursing home from natural causes, at the age of 98.
Reparations and petition to the United Nations.
Queen Mother Moore is considered one of the leading activists in the fight for reparations. Her primary two goals were the realization of reparations, as well as the self-determination of Black Americans. She advocated for a stance that recognized that the violence inflicted on African people during the time periods of the Middle Passage, Jim Crow Laws, and Slavery were a form of cultural destruction, and that extensive grassroots work and economic restitution was needed to restore communities. Her particular stance is credited as playing a large role in imagining the role that Black women play in reparations work within the context of creating diasporic African communities and calling for economic reparations.
Taking inspiration from Marcus Garvey, Moore framed her calls for reparations within a framework that believed that an integral part of economic restitution would be the "handing back" of economic and cultural wealth stolen during the process of enslavement. Moore later went on to become a member of the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), and through that work she developed a consciousness towards civil rights that included appealing to international institutions. One particularly formative moment for Moore was in 1951, when chairman of the CRC William Patterson submitted a petition to the United Nations titled "We Charge Genocide". This petition revealed many of the abuses suffered by Black Americans, and demanded action from the international community. Moore worked with Patterson, and through this work began to integrate strategies such as appealing to international networks and institutions as a mechanism of reparations action, situating her work within an internationalist framework.
Moore officially integrated a stance on reparations into her activism work in the 1960s, when forming the Universal Association of Ethiopian Women (UAEW). Moore founded the UAEW in Louisiana in response to working on cases of rape and other sexual violence against Black women. Through her work with the UAEW, Moore advocated for policy such as welfare benefits as a form of reparations for the sexual violence inflicted on Black women by white men. The UAEW also created an extensive mutual aid network, collecting food and other resources for Black women who lost access to welfare benefits due to being deemed unfit mothers under Suitable Home Law, a set of policies that targeted women who did not conform to ideals of white motherhood and domesticity.
When attempts to appeal to the United States government were ignored, Moore and the UAEW submitted an official petition to the UN. The UAEW's petition to the UN took inspiration from the CRC's 1951 petition, using the grounds that Black Americans were not true citizens, and experienced a form of violence living in the United States that was akin to genocide. The UAEW demanded that the UN recognize this, and intervene by asking the US government to abolish forms of violence such as capital punishment.
In 1962, Moore moved to Philadelphia and joined the National Emancipation Proclamation Centennial Observance Committee (NEPCOC), around the same time that the group was overhauling its mission, transitioning from a commemorative organization to one that was active in the fight for civil rights. In April 1962, the group held All-Africans Freedom Day Celebrations, where the NEPCOC announced its national mission to fight for reparations. While it appears that this action may not have materialized, the NEPCOC did organize a series of lectures on the topic of reparations, some of which include Moore as a keynote speaker.
Moore feared that as the 100-year anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation drew closer in 1963, not enough was being done to further the fight. Her role in the NEPCOC led to a conference for the drafting and finalizing of a resolution that outlined the legal and judicial justification for reparations in the United States. From this petition, a new organization was formed, African Descendants National Independence Partition Party (AD NIP). Moore played a very small role in the AD NIP's organizational structure, but her work is credited as being the founding thought from which the organization is based, particularly her work around nation building and reparations policy.

Nessos Painter

The Nessos Painter, also known as Netos or Nettos Painter, was a pioneer of Attic black-figure vase painting. He is considered to be the first Athenian to adopt the Corinthian style who went on to develop his own style and introduced innovations. The Nessos Painter is often known to be one of the original painters of black-figure. He only worked in this style, which is shown on his name vase in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. Most of the known Nessos Painter ceramics were found in funerary settings such as cemeteries and mortuaries.
Name vase.
On the neck of an amphora in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, the painter depicted Nessos fighting Heracles. The figure is also marked with the name 'Netos', the Attic dialect form of the name Nessos. John D. Beazley, the authority on Attic vase painting, attributed the name 'The Nessos Painter' to this artist. Later, after new finds in Athens and in a cemetery outside the city, paintings of chimera were identified with this painter and Beazley subsequently tried to use the name 'Chimera Painter,' but it failed to find general acceptance. Although many Greek sculptors signed their work on sculpted friezes, pot painters did not often sign their work, remaining unknown until historians such as Beazley produced modern names.
Style and themes.
Many of the artist's known works feature characters from Greek myths and legends. On the neck of a Middle Protoattic vase from the 7th century BCE, located in National Archaeological Museum of Athens, the painter depicted Nessos fighting Heracles. In this depiction Heracles is moving from left to right, opposite the direction that a victor would take, prompting the belief that most of the Nessos Painter vessels are found in funerary settings. The painter's early works are reminiscent of the proto-Corinthian style, using space-filling ornamentation like that of the Berlin Painter. The 'Nessos' vase shows the artist establishing a style distinct from the Corinthian style, which at this stage (late 7th century BCE) was marked by clear clay fields and contour drawing. The ornamentation and contour drawing was the critical distinction of the new black-figure style. Most of his work falls in the last quarter of the 7th century, during the transition from the proto-Corinthian to Corinthian. During this time he did not completely abandon contour drawing, but by using two or more etched lines he introduced a new sharpness and suggestion of form—most particularly with curls, feathers and spring designs.
The Nessos Painter also utilized the black-figure style along with artists such as Exekias, and Sophilos. This style may have contributed towards Athenian realism. Black-figure style originated in Corinth, but became very popular among Athenians. Athenian realism may also have begun with black-figure painting. The painting on the Nessos Painter's name vase uses emotions portrayed through the story of Heracles killing Nessos. 
According to Martin Robertson, The Nessos Painter is considered by historians to be the essential link between classical Attic vase painting and the new Corinthian style, which uses animal motifs and mythological figures and scenes. It is sparing in its use of white opaque, but often uses red pigment to intensify the red color of the clay. It is theorized by John Boardman that Egyptian figure painting may have influenced the Nessos Painter and his contemporaries, as the Egyptians used white to signify that a face belonged to a female and red to indicate that it belonged to a male. H.H. Scullard argues that Greece did not produce black-figure pottery, contributing to the demand of imported vessels in a style that has become popular among citizens that have traveled to Athens. Neither was Greece known for producing pottery that focused on religious subject matter, making Athens and artists such as the Nessos Painter even more popular among foreign travelers.
Myths of Heracles originated with the Etruscans who were fascinated by the demigod and stories of his travels to the underworld and ascent to Mount Olympus to live with the gods after his death. The myth portrayed on the vessel shows Heracles trying to rescue Deianira from the centaur Nessos whom he shoots with his arrow. The story involves Deianira and Heracles summoning the centaur Nessos to cross the river Evenus in order to escape Oineus who was upset about his murdered nephew. Heracles crosses the river first, leaving Deianira with Nessos who attempts to rape her. Heracles, being so far away can only use his bow and arrow to shoot Nessos. While Nessos lays dying, he offers Deianira some of his blood to use as a love potion for Heracles. Unbeknownst to her, his blood is poisonous. Eventually, Deianira, jealous of Heracles's many sexual conquests, smears Nessos's blood on Heracles's cloak, burning his skin, driving him mad, and killing him. The vessel also has a depiction of Deianira riding away in a chariot with four horses, a scene that occurs after Heracles has saved Deianira and returns to strike the centaur once more to make sure he is dead. This myth was so popular with the Etruscans that they ended up purchasing many vessels depicting the scene.
Another distinctive feature of the Nessos Painter was the scale of some of his work, which reached over a meter in height.
Examples of work.
In the name vase amphora depicting Nessos fighting Heracles, the painter utilizes iconography such as a depiction of Heracles with a mustache. This differs from artwork that typically shows Heracles with a beard and his usual attire of a lion skin cloak and lion mask. The names of both Nessos and Heracles are written above them, indicating that either the artist or someone in his workshop was literate. The rest of the scenery features symbols typical for late rosettes. Scholars have noted that the scene may have been depicted under water due to symbols featured above the image - ducks, zig zags, and spirals. The vase's artwork puts an emphasis on Heracles and does not feature Deianira in the center, something that historians such as R.M. Linders believed was done to emphasize Heracles slaying the centaur Nessos. Another rare example of his works would include Attic black-figure Neck Amphora Fragment, discovered in Attica, Greece in about 620 BCE.

The Anaheim Fire &amp; Rescue is the agency that provides fire protection and emergency medical services for the city of Anaheim, California.
History.
In 1857 the City of Anaheim was incorporated and the City's volunteer fire system was established. Initially the volunteer department consisted of twenty men. It wasn't until 1915 that the department purchased their first motorized ladder truck. At this time the Anaheim City Council authorized the employment of two full-time firemen. These two men worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and lived at the Anaheim Fire Station.
Volunteers continued to provide fire services until 1960, when the number of annual calls reached nearly a thousand and it was felt that the Department should be made up of professionally trained fire personnel.
Metro Cities Fire Authority.
Anaheim Fire &amp; Rescue is part of the Metro Cities Fire Authority which provides emergency communications for multiple departments in and around Orange County. The call center, known as Metro Net Fire Dispatch, is located in Anaheim and provides 9-1-1 fire and EMS dispatch to over 1.2 million residents, covering an area of .

Madame Bovary (1949 film)

Madame Bovary is a 1949 American romantic drama, a film adaptation of the classic 1857 novel of the same name by Gustave Flaubert. It stars Jennifer Jones, James Mason, Van Heflin, Louis Jourdan, Alf Kjellin (billed as Christopher Kent), Gene Lockhart, Frank Allenby and Gladys Cooper.
It was directed by Vincente Minnelli and produced by Pandro S. Berman, from a screenplay by Robert Ardrey based on the Flaubert novel. The music score was by Miklós Rózsa, the cinematography by Robert H. Planck and the art direction by Cedric Gibbons and Jack Martin Smith.
The film was a project of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios and Lana Turner was set to star, but when pregnancy forced her to withdraw, Jones stepped into the title role. Production ran from mid-December 1948 to mid-March 1949 and the film premiered the following August.
The story of a frivolous and adulterous wife presented censorship issues with the Motion Picture Production Code. A plot device which structured the story around author Flaubert's obscenity trial was developed to placate the censors. One famous sequence of the film is an elaborately choreographed ball sequence set to composer Miklós Rózsa's film score.
The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration in 1950 for Cedric Gibbons, Jack Martin Smith, Edwin B. Willis and Richard Pefferle.
Plot.
In an 1850s Paris courtroom, author Gustave Flaubert attempts to prevent the banning of his novel "Madame Bovary". His accusers have described the book's title character as shocking and immoral. Flaubert counters with a narration of Bovary's story from his own realist perspective. Thus, we are introduced to 20-year-old Emma, a lonely woman who fantasizes a perfect life for herself. She falls in love with Dr. Charles Bovary. The two are married and move into a small house in Normandy. Emma re-decorates it lavishly, incurring much debt. Bemoaning her lack of social status, Emma tells Charles she wants a baby boy, someone not confined in accordance with Second French Empire’s repressive cultural norms. Instead, Emma gives birth to a girl, Berthe. She soon tires of her role as mother and leaves Berthe's upbringing to her nanny. Unhappy with her life, Emma embarks on a relationship with Leon Dupuis, but his mother induces him to move to Paris and enroll in law school.
After Charles fails to match her lofty expectations of "heroic country doctor", Emma succumbs to the advances of aristocrat Rodolphe Boulanger, who then abandons her. A heartbroken Emma attempts suicide, but Charles intervenes. She endures several months of severe depression, but eventually recovers. Sometime after, Emma and Charles attend an opera in nearby Rouen. There, they encounter Leon, who has returned from Paris. Leon brags of attaining his law credentials and earning lots of money. At first Emma rejects Leon's attempts to renew their affair, but she finally consents. When Emma returns home, she finds that the Bovarys' outstanding remodeling debts have come back to haunt them when their house is put up for sale to satisfy creditors. One of them offers to forgive Emma's debts in exchange for sex. She refuses, deciding instead to approach Leon for money. However, Leon admits he has no money to lend her, confessing he is only a law clerk. Finally, Emma turns to Rodolphe, but he flatly refuses to help. Rather than endure shame for what she has caused, Emma breaks into the village apothecary and swallows arsenic. Charles attempts to save her, but to no avail. Emma dies. The film then returns to Flaubert and the courtroom. In the end, it is decided the author's novel will not be blocked from publication.
Production.
Lana Turner says it was the only film she turned down at MGM in her time there. She says she "got myself suspended. And it was a stinker!"
Reception.
Reviews from critics were mixed. Bosley Crowther of "The New York Times" was mostly positive, calling it a "faithful transcription" of the novel with an understanding of the protagonist "beautifully and tenderly put forth in the patient unfolding of the story which a cohort of talents has contrived." Crowther suggested, however, that Jones was "a little bit light for supporting the anguish of this classic dame." "Variety" called the film "interesting to watch but hard to feel. It is a curiously unemotional account of some rather basic emotions and this failure to plumb beneath its characters lessens the broad, general appeal somewhat. However, the surface treatment of Vincente Minnelli's direction is slick and attractively presented."
 Richard L. Coe of "The Washington Post" called it a "persuasive picture", with Jones "bringing a depth of acting infrequently seen on the screen and a performance that far outweighs any of her previous ones." Edwin Schallert of the "Los Angeles Times" wrote, "If one is patient with the slowness of 'Madame Bovary' he or she will find unique interest in this picture because in treatment and character it is well off the beaten path in Hollywood productions." However, Schallert found Jones to be "erratic in the quality of her presentation. She is pictorial on all occasions, surprisingly fine at times, very uncertain and wavering in her delineation at others." "Harrison's Reports" published a negative review, calling the direction "heavy-handed" and the story "very unpleasant and slow-moving, and not one of the principal characters wins any sympathy, not even the heroine's ill-treated husband, a weakling who humbly accepts her sinning." Philip Hamburger of "The New Yorker" called it "a dull-witted adaptation of the Flaubert classic. As interpreted by Miss Jones, Mme. Bovary could be Mme. X or Mme. Defarge, or Mme. Typhoid Mary, so amateurish and flaccid was her acting."
According to MGM records the film earned $1,132,000 in the US and Canada and $884,000 overseas resulting in a loss of $910,000.
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

Lunch atop a Skyscraper

Lunch atop a Skyscraper is a black-and-white photograph taken on September 20, 1932, of eleven ironworkers sitting on a steel beam of the RCA Building, above the ground during the construction of Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, New York City. It was a staged photograph arranged as a publicity stunt, part of a campaign promoting the skyscraper. 
The photographic negative is in the Bettmann Archive, owned by the Visual China Group. The image is often misattributed to Lewis Hine, but the identity of the actual photographer remains unclear. Evidence emerged indicating it may have been taken by Charles C. Ebbets, but it was later found that other photographers had been present at the shoot as well. Many claims have been made regarding the identities of the men in the image, though only a few have been definitively identified. Ken Johnston, manager of the historic collections of Corbis, called the image "a piece of American history".
Overview.
The photograph depicts eleven men eating lunch while sitting on a steel beam above the ground on the sixty-ninth floor of the near-completed RCA Building (now known as 30 Rockefeller Plaza) at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, New York City, on September 20, 1932. These men were immigrant ironworkers employed at the RCA Building during the construction of Rockefeller Center. They were accustomed to walking along the girders. The photograph was taken as part of a campaign promoting the skyscraper. Other photographs taken depict the workers throwing a football and pretending to sleep on the girder. Central Park is visible in the background.
History.
The photograph was distributed by Acme Newspictures and was published in newspapers as early as September 30, 1932. It was published in the Sunday supplement of the "New York Herald Tribune" on October 2, 1932, with the caption: "Lunch Atop a Skyscraper".
In 1995, Corbis Images, a company that provides archived images to professional photographers, bought a collection of over eleven million images called the Bettmann Archive. The "Lunch atop a Skyscraper" photograph was in the Acme Newspictures archive, a part of the Bettmann collection, although it was uncredited. According to Ken Johnston, manager of the historic collections of Corbis, the image was initially received in a Manila paper envelope. The original glass negative of the photograph had broken into five pieces. It is stored in a humidity and temperature-controlled preservation facility at the Iron Mountain storage facility in Pennsylvania.
In 2016, Visual China Group purchased Corbis's image division and content licensing unit, including the Bettman Archive and "Lunch atop a Skyscraper." Visual China Group licenses the photograph internationally through an agreement with Getty Images.
Identification.
Photographer.
The identity of the photographer is unknown. It was often misattributed to Lewis Hine, a Works Progress Administration photographer, from the mistaken assumption that the structure being built is the Empire State Building. In 1998, Tami Ebbets Hahn, a resident of Wilmington, North Carolina, noticed a poster of the image and speculated that it was one of her father's (Charles C. Ebbets; 1905–1978) photographs. In 2003, she contacted Johnston. Corbis hired Marksmen Inc., a private investigation firm, to find the photographer. An investigator discovered an article from "The Washington Post", which credited the image to Hamilton Wright. The Wright family, however, was not familiar with the photograph. It was common for Wright to receive credit for photographs taken by those working for him; Hahn's father had worked for the Hamilton Wright Features syndicate.
In 1932, Ebbets had been appointed the photographic director of Rockefeller Center, responsible for publicizing the new skyscraper. Hahn found her father's paycheck of $1.50 per hour (equivalent to $ per hour in ), the ironworkers photograph, and an image of her father with a camera, which appeared to be of the same place and time. Analyzing the evidence, Johnston said: "As far as I'm concerned, he's the photographer." Corbis later acknowledged Ebbets's authorship. It was later discovered that photographers Thomas Kelley, William Leftwich, and Ebbets were present there on that day. Due to the uncertain identity of the photographer, the image is again without credit.
Ironworkers.
According to a "New York Post" survey, numerous claims have been made regarding the identities of the men in the image. The 2012 documentary "Men at Lunch" investigated claims that two of the men were Irish immigrants, and the director reported in 2013 that he planned to follow up on other claims from Swedish relatives. The film confirms the identities of two men: Joseph Eckner, third from the left, and Joe Curtis, third from the right, by cross-referencing with other pictures taken the same day, in which they were named at the time. The first man on the right, holding a bottle, has been identified as Slovak worker Gustáv (Gusti) Popovič. The photograph was found in his estate, with the note "Don't you worry, my dear Mariška, as you can see I'm still with bottle" written on the back.
Legacy.
The photograph has been referred to as the "most famous picture of a lunch break in New York history" by Ashley Cross, a correspondent of the "New York Post". It has been used and imitated in many artworks, and has been colorized. Sculptor Sergio Furnari modeled from it a statue, which was displayed near the World Trade Center site after the September 11 attacks. The image has been a best seller for its licensors. Although critics have dismissed the photograph as a publicity stunt, Johnston called it "a piece of American history". Taken during the Great Depression, the photograph became an icon of New York City and has often been re-created by construction workers. "Time" included the image in its 2016 list of the 100 most influential images. Discussing the significance of the image in 2012, Johnston said:
There's the incongruity between the action – lunch – and the place – 800 feet in the air – and that these guys are so casual about it. It's visceral: I've had people tell me they have trouble looking at it out of fear of heights. And these men – you feel you get a very strong sense of their characters through their expressions, clothes and poses.
The photograph also inspired a ride called the Beam, which opened on the former RCA Building's 69th floor terrace in December 2023.

Topa ou Não Topa () is the Brazilian version of "Deal or No Deal", broadcast in Portuguese by SBT. It is hosted by Silvio Santos. There are 26 cases, containing amounts from 50 centavos (US$0.16) to R$1,000,000 (US$320,000). On August 25, 2010, the game show returned and the host is Roberto Justus but in similar set to the old version.
Like most sets of Brazilian versions of US game shows, their set and graphics are a dead ringer to the American counterpart.
The R$1,000,000 grand prize was won by a man named Paulo in April 2007.
Eu Compro O Seu Televisor.
A unlicensed Brazilian version of Deal or No Deal in 2004, called Eu Compro Seu Televisor (lit. "I" "Buy Your Television"), also hosted by Silvio Santos and broadcast by SBT. Instead of suitcases like US version, the format of the show was very similar to the Italy version, except use 20 televisions instead of boxes, with certain values, from R$1 to R$1,000,000, and also featured quiz round. 
In July 2004, Endemol International filed an injunction against SBT. The injunction was revoked and the show continued on the air until July 28, 2004.

Narjis

Narjis () is believed by the Twelvers to have been the mother of their Hidden Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi. His birth is said to have been providentially concealed by his father, Hasan al-Askari, out of fear of Abbasid persecution as they sought to eliminate an expected child of the eleventh Imam, whom persistent rumors described as a savior. After the death of his father in 260 AH (873-874 CE), al-Mahdi is believed by the Twelvers to have entered a state of occultation which continues until his rise in the end of time to establish peace and justice on earth. The origin of Narjis is recorded as the Byzantine or Nubia and her tomb is believed to be located in the al-Askari shrine in Samarra, Iraq.
Historical background.
Until their deaths, the tenth and eleventh Shia Imams (Ali al-Hadi and Hasan al-Askari, respectively) were held under close surveillance in the garrison town of Samarra by the Abbasids, who are often responsible in Shia sources for poisoning the two Imams.
Contemporary to the tenth Imam, the Abbasid al-Mutawakkil heavily persecuted the Shia, partly due to a renewed Zaydi opposition. The restrictive policies of al-Mutawakkil towards the tenth Imam were later adopted by his son, al-Mu'tamid, who is reported to have kept the eleventh Imam under house arrest without any visitors. Instead, al-Askari is known to have mainly communicated with his followers through a network of representatives. Among them was Uthman ibn Sa'id, who is said to have disguised himself as a seller of cooking fat to avoid the Abbasid agents, hence his nickname al-Samman. Tabatabai suggests that these restrictions were placed on al-Askari because the caliphate had come to know about traditions among the Shia elite, predicting that the eleventh Imam would father the eschatological Mahdi.
Death of al-Askari.
Al-Askari died in 260 (873–874) without an obvious heir. Immediately after the death of the eleventh Imam, his main representative, Uthman ibn Sa'id, claimed that the Imam had an infant son, named Muhammad, who was kept hidden from the public out of fear of Abbasid persecution, as they sought to eliminate an expected child of al-Askari, whom persistent rumors described as a savior. Uthman also claimed that he had been appointed to represent Muhammad, who is more commonly known as Muhammad al-Mahdi ().
Being the closest associate of al-Askari, Uthman's assertions were largely accepted by other representatives of al-Askari. Those who accepted the imamate of this Muhammad later formed the Twelvers. The other sects created over the succession of al-Askari disappeared within a hundred years.
Occultation.
Thus began a period of about seventy years, later termed the Minor Occultation (, 260-329 AH, 874–941 CE), during which it is believed that four successive agents represented Muhammad al-Mahdi, the Hidden Imam. The fourth agent, al-Samarri, is said to have received a letter from Muhammad al-Mahdi shortly before his death in 941 CE. The letter predicted the death of al-Samarri in six days and announced the beginning of the complete occultation, later called the Major Occultation, which continues to this day. The letter, ascribed to Muhammad al-Mahdi, added that the complete occultation would continue until God granted him permission to manifest himself again in a time when the earth would be filled with tyranny.
Name.
Muhammad al-Mahdi is said to have been born to Narjis, though some sources give her name differently as Sawsan, Rayhana, Sayqal, and Maryam. The first three are names of flowers. As a slave, those names were likely given to her by her owner, Hakima Khatun, in keeping with the practice of the day, while Sayqal might have been her real name.
Origin.
The origin of Narjis is recorded by some sources as the Byzantine empire or Nubia. The earliest account about her origin is given by Ibn Babawayh (), based on a chain of authority leading to Bishr ibn Sulayman al-Nakhkhas. According to this account, Narjis was a slave, bought providentially by an agent of al-Hadi, who had recognized by clairvoyance in her the future mother of al-Mahdi. This and the detailed accounts of Majlesi and Tusi describe Narjis as a captured granddaughter of the Byzantine emperor and a pious woman who learned about her future union with al-Askari in a dream. These accounts have been described as hagiographic.
Possibly the correct account is the one given by al-Mufid (), who writes that Narjis was a slave, born and raised in the house of Hakima Khatun, daughter of al-Jawad (the ninth Imam) and paternal aunt of al-Askari. Narjis was given in marriage to al-Askari by his father, al-Hadi, when the former was about twenty-two years old.
Birth of Muhammad al-Mahdi.
Twelver sources report that the son of al-Askari was born to his wife, Narjis, around 255 (868). He was named Abu al-Qasim Muhammad, the same name and as the Islamic prophet, though he is more commonly known as Muhammad al-Mahdi. His birthdate is given differently, but most sources seem to agree on 15 Sha'ban, which is celebrated by the Shia for this occasion. The differences in these accounts have been attributed to al-Askari's attempts to hide the birth of his son from the Abbasids.
The birth of al-Mahdi is often compared in Twelver sources to the birth of Moses in the Quran, who was miraculously saved from the pharaoh. As a child Imam, al-Mahdi is also often compared in Twelver sources to Jesus, since both are viewed as the proof of God () and both spoke with the authority of an adult while still a child.
The earliest account of his birth is given by Ibn Babawayh on the authority of Hakima Khatun, a close relative who was held in high esteem by the tenth and eleventh Imams. The account describes that the pregnancy of Narjis miraculously had no physical signs, similar to Moses' mother, and that Hakima Khatun was brought in as midwife only when the birth was due. While this and similar accounts are hagiographic in nature, they seem to suggest that the pregnancy of Narjis and birth of his son were deliberately concealed.
The Twelver accounts add that, except for a few trusted associates, the existence of al-Mahdi was kept secret since the Abbasids sought to eliminate the son of al-Askari, whom persistent rumors described as a savior. Hussain writes that the infant must have been sent to Medina, where al-Askari's mother lived. It is also known that al-Askari left his estate to his mother, Hadith. Amir-Moezzi and Hussain suggest that this was another tactic by al-Askari to hide the birth of his son: in Shia jurisprudence (), under certain conditions, the mother is the sole inheritor if the deceased is childless.
After the death of al-Askari.
The death of al-Askari in 260 (873–874) followed a brief illness, during which the Abbasid al-Mu'tamid sent his doctors and servants to attend the Imam. Considering that al-Askari did not have an obvious heir, some have suggested that the caliph intended to closely monitor al-Askari from within his residence.
After the death of al-Askari, there are reports that his residence was searched and the women were examined for pregnancy, possibly in the hope of finding his heir. A female servant of al-Askari was held for a while, perhaps due to false rumors of her pregnancy designed to distract the Abbasids in their search.
After the death of al-Askari, Narjis claimed to be pregnant to stop the officers from searching for the newborn, according to Sachedina. She was subsequently held in al-Mu'tamid's palace for observation. Her escape from the palace placed her at the center of disputes between Uthman and his son, on one side, and a brother of al-Askari, on the other side. Before his death, al-Askari left his estate to his mother, Hadith, to the exclusion of his brother, Ja'far, who had earlier unsuccessfully laid claim to the imamate after the death of their father, al-Hadi. Ja'far repeated his claims to the imamate after the death of al-Askari, which found a following this time in the form of the now-extinct Ja'fariyya and Fathiyya sects. Ja'far also contested al-Askari's will and raised the case with the authorities. Al-Askari was apparently childless, and Hadith was thus regarded as the sole inheritor in Shia law. The caliph, however, ruled the inheritance to be divided between Hadith and Ja'far. When Narjis escaped from al-Mu'tamid's palace, the tensions between the two groups heightened to the point that Narjis was given protection by a member of the powerful Shia family Nawbakht]i.
Tomb.
The tomb of Narjis is located in the al-Askari shrine in Samarra, Iraq. The shrine also houses the tombs of Hasan al-Askari, Ali al-Hadi, and Hakima Khatun. As an important destination for Shia pilgrimage, the shrine was bombed in February 2006 and badly damaged. Another attack was executed on 13 June 2007, which led to the destruction of the two minarets of the shrine. Authorities in Iraq hold al-Qaeda responsible for this attack.
A nearby shrine is said to mark the place where the occultation took place, under which there is a cellar () that hides a well (Bi'r al-Ghayba, ). Into this well, al-Mahdi is said to have disappeared.
In popular culture.
"Princess of Rome", directed by Hadi Mohamadian, is an animated movie about Narjis, the mother of Muhammad al-Mahdi. "Princess of Rome" was screened at the thirty-third Fajr International Film Festival in February 2015 in Tehran and received positive reviews.

James Goodnight

James Howard Goodnight (born January 6, 1943) is an American billionaire businessman and software developer. He has been the CEO of SAS since 1976, which he co-founded that year with other faculty members of North Carolina State University. As of 2025, his net worth was estimated at US$18.5 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index and he is regarded as the richest person in North Carolina.
Early life and career.
Goodnight was born to Albert Goodnight and Dorothy Patterson in Salisbury, North Carolina, on January 6, 1943. He lived in Greensboro until he was 12, when his family moved to Wilmington. As a kid he worked at his father's hardware store.
Goodnight's career with computers began with a Mathematics course at North Carolina State University. One summer he got a job writing software programs for the agricultural economics department. Goodnight was a member of the Beta-Beta chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon at NC State, and contributed to the construction of a new fraternity house for the chapter in 2002.
Goodnight received a master's degree in statistics in 1968. He also worked at a company building electronic equipment for the ground stations that communicated with the Apollo space capsules. While working on the Apollo program, Goodnight experienced a work environment with a high turnover rate and this shaped his views on corporate culture. Goodnight returned to North Carolina State University after working on the Apollo project, where he earned a PhD in statistics and was a faculty member from 1972 to 1976.
Career.
Creation of SAS at NCSU.
While at North Carolina State, Goodnight collaborated with fellow faculty member Anthony James Barr as project leaders for a research project to create a general purpose statistical analysis system (the original meaning of the name SAS) for analyzing agricultural data. The project was operated by a consortium of eight land-grant universities and funded primarily by the USDA. John Sall joined the project in 1973.
Founding SAS Institute.
In 1976, the software had 100 customers, and Goodnight made the decision to establish a private company around it. Goodnight, together with Sall, Barr, and Jane Helwig, left NCSU to found SAS Institute. They were originally based out of an office across the street from the university.
By 1979, SAS had outgrown its original office in Raleigh. Goodnight felt that it would be good for the company to move out of the city and into a more "serene" location, and the group eventually decided on Cary, North Carolina. SAS Institute moved into a new office there in 1980.
Growth and expansion.
As of 2025, Goodnight has remained CEO of SAS Institute for nearly 50 years. Under his leadership, the company experienced continuous growth. Its revenue increased from $138,000 in its first year in business, to $420 million in 1993 and $3.2 billion in 2022. 
SAS is one of the largest privately held software providers in the world. It develops several suites of software related to statistical analysis, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing, including SAS, JMP and SAS Viya.
The SAS campus in Cary has grown to cover 900 acres, with approximately 4,000 out of the company's 10,000 employees based there.
For most of SAS' history, Goodnight rejected acquisition offers and chosen not to take SAS public to protect the company's work environment. Since 2021, Goodnight has been guiding the company's preparation for an initial public offering (IPO). The planned IPO will allow the company to offer stock options to employees and to raise its profile.
Leadership style.
Goodnight created SAS' corporate culture, often described by the media as "utopian." Throughout the company's history, Goodnight has maintained a flat and flexible organizational structure at the company. During the company's early years, he introduced benefits such as profit sharing, 35-hour work weeks, on-site medical care, childcare, and other services for employees which have contributed to improved productivity and employee retention.
HSM Global described Goodnight's leadership style in a framework of three pillars: "help employees do their best work by keeping them intellectually challenged and by removing distractions; make managers responsible for sparking creativity; eliminate arbitrary distinctions between 'suits' and 'creatives'; engage customers as creative partners to help deliver superior products."
Awards and recognition.
In 1981, Goodnight was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. Goodnight has been called the "Godfather of AI" for his role in the creation of SAS.
In 1997, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2004, he was named a Great American Business Leader by Harvard Business School. That same year he was named one of America's 25 Most Fascinating Entrepreneurs by Inc. Magazine. He has also been a frequent speaker and participant at the World Economic Forum. In March 2020, Jim Goodnight was awarded a CEO Great Place to Work For All Leadership Award by Great Place to Work.
Personal life.
Goodnight met his wife, Ann, while he was a senior at North Carolina State University and she was attending Meredith College. They have been married for over 50 years and have three children, including real estate redeveloper and historic preservationist James Goodnight.
Rock collection.
Goodnight has an interest in rock collecting. As a child, Goodnight would collect quartzes and arrowheads in the Greensboro area. He rediscovered his interest in geology in adulthood and began collecting rare rocks and other natural objects. In addition to minerals, he has also collected fossilized wood, dinosaur eggs and arrowheads from the Archaic period in North Carolina (dating between 8,000 BC and 1,000 BC). His collection includes hundreds of pieces, coming from over 40 countries. Goodnight has described rocks and minerals as a genre of art.
Parts of the collection are exhibited on the SAS campus in Cary, North Carolina. The display has been described as "a testament to his love of unique pieces of earth, from petrified dinosaur eggs, to impressive, mosaic chunks of native granite, to large, glassy meteorites." Goodnight has loaned pieces from his collection to the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences for the enjoyment of the public. A selection of pieces are displayed in the Betsy M. Bennett Bridge to Discovery, which links the museum to its Nature Research Center.
Wealth and philanthropy.
In April 2023, Goodnight's net worth was estimated at US$7.4 billion, making him the richest person in North Carolina, ahead of Epic Games' Tim Sweeney. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimated his net worth to be US$11 billion in April 2024.
Goodnight has an interest in improving the state of education, particularly elementary and secondary education. He has advocated for increased funding for STEM education in the United States to prevent brain-drain and the outsourcing of research and technology jobs to other countries. In 1996, Goodnight and his wife, along with his business partner, John Sall and his wife Ginger, founded an independent prep school Cary Academy. He has advocated for restructuring preschool funding in North Carolina to extend access to more children in the state.
The Goodnights have engaged in various philanthropic activities related to North Carolina State University. They created the Goodnight Scholarships, including the Goodnight Scholars Program and the Goodnight Transfer Scholars Program, which provides full tuition scholarships and development programs to students in STEM. Their endowments have also created the Goodnight Doctoral Fellowship, 28 named faculty positions, and a deanship at North Carolina State.
The Goodnights also founded the Goodnight Educational Foundation in 2005. The foundation has supported the North Carolina Independent Colleges and Universities' Science of Reading Initiative. In 2023, the Goodnight Distinguished Professorship in Early Literacy at Western Carolina University was established with a $1.5 million endowment from the foundation. Goodnight has also contributed to the William and Ida Friday Institute for Educational Innovation.
The Goodnights have also donated to causes such as wildlife conservation and historical preservation. They sponsored the Jim and Ann Goodnight Museum Park, part of the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh. In 2018, Goodnight and his wife were awarded by the North Carolina Museum of History for their contributions to the preservation of North Carolina history. He is a patron of the Carolina Ballet.
Both of the Goodnights are also involved in the local Cary, North Carolina, community. He has invested heavily in real estate in Cary, which - in addition to tax revenue generated by SAS and the attraction of thousands of employees - has contributed to the town's growth since the 1970s. He has also invested in the development of the neighboring community of Chatham Park. He owns Prestonwood Country Club and The Umstead Hotel and Spa situated on the edge of the SAS campus.

Fullerton Fire Department

The Fullerton Fire Department is the agency that provides fire protection and emergency medical services for Fullerton, California. The department is responsible for an area of approximately that has a population of just over 141,874 as of 2020.
History.
The Fullerton Fire Department was formally established as a volunteer department on August 10, 1908. The initial apparatus included a hand-drawn hook and ladder truck, a hand-drawn chemical wagon, and some ancillary equipment. In 1913 the voters passed a $5,000 bond issue, which was used to purchase the first piece of motorized apparatus, a 1913 Seagrave triple-combination (ladder, hose, and chemical) engine that was housed in rented quarters in the 200 block of North Spadra (now Harbor Boulevard). The city's first formal fire station was opened in 1926 in the 100 block of West Wilshire Avenue. This building housed the department's apparatus on the ground floor, while the second floor housed the city hall. In 1942, when a new city hall was built, the second floor of the Wilshire Avenue building was converted into sleeping quarters for the firefighters.
A second station was added at Brookhurst and Valencia in 1953 to serve the west side of the city, and a third was added at 700 S. Acacia to serve the east side of the city. By 1961 the department had made the transition from a volunteer department to one staffed by career firefighters. A bond issue passed in the mid-1960s funded the construction of a new fire department headquarters building at 312 E. Commonwealth. At that time the Wilshire Avenue station was leveled. The same bond funded the construction of a fourth station at 3251 N. Harbor Blvd. to serve the north-central part of the city, and a fifth station at 2555 E. Yorba Linda Blvd. to serve the rapidly growing east side of the city, which included the Cal State Fullerton campus.
A sixth station was opened at 1500 North Gilbert on the west side of the city in 1968. In 2004 this station was replaced by a new $3.4 million station that was built for the city by private developers as part of an agreement that allowed the developers to build on property owned by Chevron Land and Development.
On May 3, 2011 Fullerton and the Brea Fire Department from the adjacent city of Brea entered into an agreement to share the command structure of their respective fire departments. Under this agreement both share a fire chief, three division chiefs (operations, fire marshal, and administration), and four battalion chiefs (BC's). Three are shift battalion chiefs, and one is the battalion chief in charge of training. The command structure sharing agreement, will save Fullerton $463,000 annually, and will save Brea $881,000 annually.
Metro Cities Fire Authority.
The Fullerton Fire Department is part of the Metro Cities Fire Authority which provides emergency communications for multiple departments in and around Orange County. The call center, known as Metro Net Fire Dispatch, is located in Anaheim and provides 9-1-1 fire and EMS dispatch to over 1.2 million residence covering an area of . Other departments included in Metro Net include Anaheim Fire Department, Brea Fire Department, Fountain Valley, Huntington Beach Fire Department, Newport Beach Fire Department, Orange Fire Department and Orange County Fire Authority.
The Fullerton Fire Department also is part of the Orange County 800 MHz Countywide Coordinated Communications System. This system provides radio communications to law enforcement, fire services, public works departments, lifeguard, and marine safety services throughout the county. This system facilitates interoperability between units from different agencies, and makes possible a virtually seamless mutual aid system throughout the county.
Additionally, the Fullerton Fire Department is part of the county-wide automatic mutual aid system, which ensures that the nearest available fire and paramedic units are dispatched to a call regardless of the location. Fire departments throughout the county, including Fullerton, employ the incident command system routinely to coordinate resources during significant events. The automatic mutual aid system is used to dispatch resources from Fullerton and surrounding jurisdictions as needed in the event of a multiple alarm fire or other major emergency within the city. The automatic mutual aid system also is used to dispatch resources to incidents within the city when Fullerton units are unavailable owing to prior assignments, or for incidents occurring near the city limits in cases where the unit(s) from another jurisdiction can respond more quickly.
Stations &amp; Apparatus.
The Fullerton Fire Department currently has six fire stations strategically located throughout the city.
Community Emergency Response Team.
The Community Emergency Response Team for the city of Fullerton is sponsored by the Fullerton Fire Department. The Fullerton CERT is integrated into the command structure of the fire department. The team has its own volunteer command structure, which reports directly to the fire department battalion chief in charge of training. The team generally sponsors three training academies for the general public each year, which are open to those people over 18 years of age who reside or work in the city. Those persons who complete the training academy, which covers the standard, basic CERT training curriculum provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are eligible to become active members of Fullerton CERT provided that they successfully complete a fingerprint live scan and background check.
In the event of a major emergency that affects the city, Fullerton CERT is activated by the fire chief (or his designee).

Polygnotos (active approx. 450 – 420 BCE), a Greek vase-painter in Athens, is considered one of the most important vase painters of the red figure style of the high-classical period. He received his training in the workshop of the Niobid Painter and specialized in monumental vases, as in the manner of Polygnotos of Thasos, after whom he probably designated himself. He was the leading vase painter of the Group of Polygnotos which carries his name.
He painted particularly large containers such as "stamnoi", kraters, hydria and shoulder amphorae, as well as Nolan amphorae and "pelike".
Beside this famous vase painter two further vase painters have the name Polygnotos. They have become known in the scholarly literature as the Lewis Painter and the Nausikaa Painter.

Port Fulton, Indiana

Port Fulton was a town located two miles up the river from Louisville, within present-day Jeffersonville, Indiana. At its height it stretched from the Ohio River to modern-day 10th Street, and from Crestview to Jefferson/Main Streets.
Port Fulton was laid out in 1835 by Victor Neff, and named for Robert Fulton, the inventor of steamboats. Its original boundaries were present day Jackson Street (east), Division Street (west), and between Court and Charlestown Streets to the north. It became a magnet for those in the maritime business. Henry French, a steamboat builder, already had a home there. The Howard Family resided there. The shipyards of both French and Howard became Jeffboat.
In April 1853 the city of Jeffersonville attempted to annex Port Fulton, only to be stymied by its residents.
The third-largest Civil War hospital, Jefferson General Hospital, was operated there, formed from the Brighton estate owned by Jesse Bright that was confiscated by Union authorities.
In 1880 the population was 907; in 1900, it was 1,104. However, Port Fulton's population declined to 971 in the 1920 census. This allowed Jeffersonville to finally annex Port Fulton in 1926.

North-East Region, Singapore

The North-East Region is one of the five regions in the city-state of Singapore. The region is the most densely populated and has the highest population among the five, with Sengkang being its most populous town as of 2020 and Seletar as the regional centre. Comprising 13,810 hectares, it includes seven planning areas and is largely a residential region with 217,120 homes. Housing largely consists of high-density HDB public housing estates, however private housing is also present in the region. As its name implies, it is located in the north-eastern part of Singapore.
The North-East Region, along with the four other planning regions, was officially established by the Urban Redevelopment Authority in 1999. Prior to the 1970s, the region was predominantly rural and experienced very little urbanisation. It was only with the development of towns such as Ang Mo Kio and Hougang over the next few decades that the region began to grow significantly in population and experienced dramatic urban development. As of 2020, the North-East Region has a population of 930,910. While predominantly a residential region, the North-East Region is also home to tourist attractions, such as Pulau Ubin and Coney Island. The region has a number of hospitals, parks, educational facilities, and security and defence services. There are also a variety of transport options, including Mass Rapid Transit, Light Rail Transit and public bus services, facilitating transport within and outside the region.
History.
Before the 1960s, the North-East Region was primarily made up of farmland and rainforest. At this time the majority of urbanisation in Singapore was concentrated in the southern part of the country, where the Central Region is now located. The first Master Plan was adopted in 1958. The Master Plan was a statutory plan which regulated land use and development over a 20-year period, to be reviewed every five years. One of the main aims of this plan was to establish New Towns away from the Central Region, laying the precedent for the North-East Region’s urban development. However, this plan was soon deemed inefficient and not flexible enough to accommodate the rapid demographic and economic development in Singapore. In 1971 the Concept Plan was introduced, a more long-term plan which rather than providing a detailed guide for urban planning, it simply provided a general direction for development over the next 40 to 50 years. These two combined planning processes (The Master Plan and the Concept Plan) continue to be revised every few years, led by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. 
It was over the next few decades that towns within the North East Region were built up. The first new towns were Ang Mo Kio and Hougang. Ang Mo Kio New Town began development in 1973 and Hougang in 1979. Up until the 1990s, the North-East Region was included as part of the Rural Planning Area. This area consisted of most of the land outside of the Central Planning Area. However, under the 1991 Concept Plan, the country was officially organised into five regions, along with 55 subdivision. Thus, the North East Region was established. This system allowed for more area specific planning and detailed land use guides.
Geography.
Situated at the northeastern corner of Singapore Island, the region comprises a total land area of , including the North-Eastern cluster of islands, Pulau Ubin, Pulau Tekong and Pulau Tekong Kechil. It borders Singapore's East Region to the east, Central Region to the south and North Region to the west.
Government.
The North-East Region is governed locally by four different Community Development Councils, namely the Central CDC, North East CDC, North West CDC and South East CDC.
Planning Areas.
The North-East Region is divided into 7 different planning areas, with a total of 48 subzones.
Demographics.
According to the Singapore Department of Statistics’ 2020 Population Trends report, the total population of the North-East Region is 930,910. Out of its 7 planning areas, Sengkang is the most populated, with 249,370 residents. Alternatively, the North-Eastern Islands is the least populated area with only 50 residents, as it is one of the few areas in Singapore that has not experienced dramatic urban development.
According to the 2015 General Household Survey, the most common ethnic background in the North-East Region is Chinese, accounting for the majority of the population. Additionally, English is the most common language spoken at home (35.4%), closely followed by Mandarin (33.9%). Other common languages spoken at home include other Chinese dialects (13.4%), Malay (7.8%) and Tamil (3.5%). The most popular religion followed is Buddhism (36.3%), while other prevalent religions in the region include Christianity (19.3%), Taoism (11.1%), Islam (9.1%) and Hinduism (4.6%). In addition, 19.1% of people practise no religion.
Economy.
Aviation.
The region is home to the Seletar Aerospace Park, which houses several aviation manufacturing and research facilities owned by companies such as Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Singapore Technologies Aerospace, allowing the aviation industry in Singapore to expand out of Changi, which is a major aviation and commercial zone located in the East region of the country. Several industrial zones are also located within the region such as Defu Industrial Estate in Hougang and Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park in Ang Mo Kio.
Technology.
The Punggol Digital District, a business park located in Punggol, houses companies in the digital industry. Announced in 2018, the business park is expected to provide 28,000 jobs in the technology sector, specialising in cyber security, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, fintech, and smart living.
Tourism.
Located within the North-Eastern Islands planning area, Pulau Ubin is a popular tourist attraction with both local and foreign visitors visiting the island as it is one of the last rural areas in Singapore, with an abundance of natural flora and fauna. It is particularly popular for outdoor activities such as mountain biking, as it is home to the Ketam Mountain Bike Park. Additionally, the Chek Jawa wetlands is also a popular attraction due to its array of wildlife and unique biodiversity. Ubin Town is the only settlement on the island and offers a number of restaurants, bicycle rental shops and other small shops catering to tourism.
Coney Island, also known as Pulau Serangoon, is also a popular attraction within the region. Located off the northeastern coast within the planning area of Punggol, Coney island is accessible via two bridges at the eastern and western ends of the island, linking it to the main island. Visitors to the island can participate in activities such as cycling, bird watching and nature walks. Coney Island Park is managed by the National Parks Board and home to a range of different habitats and a variety of fauna and flora.
Infrastructure.
Education.
Residents living within the area have access to different educational facilities ranging from preschools to primary and secondary schools as these are located around the different towns in the North-East region. 
There are 28 secondary schools within the North-East Region, including:
There are also 44 primary schools within the region, including: 
The area is also home to various tertiary institutions such as, Anderson Serangoon Junior College, ITE College Central, Nanyang Junior College, Nanyang Polytechnic and the Singapore Institute of Technology. There are also 3 international schools, namely, the Australian International School Singapore, the French School of Singapore and the Global Indian International School Singapore.
Healthcare.
Sengkang General Hospital is the largest hospital in the region. The 1000-bed hospital was opened on the 18th of August 2018 and is managed by SingHealth. Other hospitals in the North-East region include Ang Mo Kio - Thye Hua Kwan Hospital, Bright Vision Hospital and Sengkang Community Hospital, which is attached to Sengkang General Hospital.
Parklands.
There are a number of parks within the region, all of which are managed by the National Parks Board.
Parks within the North-East region include:
Fire Department.
The Singapore Civil Defence Force operates two fire stations in the region:
Ang Mo Kio Fire Station has been operational since 1984 and provides services to Ang Mo Kio and Serangoon. 
Sengkang Fire Station has been operational since 2001 and provides services to Hougang, Punggol, Sengkang and Serangoon.
Along with the fire stations, there are also two fire posts in the region:
Transportation.
The public transport system in Singapore was designed to connect the North-East Region to the city centre, with Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations in each town centre. There is also a number of bus stops and Light Rail Transit (LRT) stations which connect towns within the region. As of 2015, 59.5% of the working population aged fifteen and older use public transport regularly to get to work. The North East region also has one airport: Seletar Airport. The airport was formally a military airbase, but is now owned by the Singapore government and operated by Changi Airport Group. It is mostly used for flight training, private aircraft and chartered flights.
Rail.
There are three MRT lines that operate in the North-East Region: North East line, North-South line and Circle Line. The North East line is the most prominent. It runs from HarbourFront station in the Central Region to Punggol station in the north, connecting six MRT stations within the North-East Region, namely Serangoon, Kovan, Hougang, Buangkok, Sengkang, Punggol and Pungol Coast MRT stationstations. In 2024 the line is expected to be extended to include the Punggol Coast MRT station, which is under construction. Yio Chu Kang and Ang Mo Kio are the stations located on the North-South line in this region. Tai Seng, Bartley, Serangoon and Lorong Chuan stations are on the Circle line in this region.
In addition, the Cross Island MRT line, which is currently under planning, is expected to cross through the region. Plans for the project were first announced in 2013, and the Land Transport Authority expects that it will be completed by 2030. The line will connect to Ang Mo Kio station, Hougang station, Punggol station and Riviera station, along with future MRT stations including Serangoon North station, Defu station, Tavistock station and Teck Ghee station.
There are also 28 operational LRT stations in the region, connecting residential areas to the MRT lines. There are two main LRT lines in the region: the Punggol LRT line and the Sengkang LRT line.
Bus.
The North-East Region has an established public bus network and a number of bus interchanges connecting towns within the region and to other parts of the country.
The following bus interchanges are located within the North-East Region:
Expressways.
There are four expressways that pass through the North East Region: Central Expressway, Seletar Expressway, Tampines Expressway and Kallang–Paya Lebar Expressway. Additionally, the North–South Corridor, an under-construction expressway, is planned to connect to Ang Mo Kio.
Housing.
The North-East Region is predominantly a residential area. Like other regions outside the city centre, towns in the North-East Region are largely made up of high-density, high-rise public housing, provided by the Housing and Development Board (HDB). HDB estates make up 78.72% of households in the region. Each of these housing developments are designed for self-sufficiency, with schools, hospitals, parks, sports facilities, shopping malls and other amenities easily available to residents. The North-East Region experiences continual development of housing and other public facilities. New housing in Ang Mo Kio, Hougang and Serangoon is being developed, along with new transport options, parks and other amenities. In recent years, the HDB has also developed more of a focus on sustainability and incorporating ecological considerations into town planning. The town of Punggol was branded as the “first eco-town”, with more greenery incorporated into the area, along with the development of the Punggol Promenade and Waterway.
Landmarks.
Historic sites.
The National Heritage Board has designated a number of “historic sites” in Singapore, some of which are located in the North-East Region. These include:

Eli Eshed

Eli Eshed () is an Israeli researcher of popular culture.
Literary criticism.
Eli Eshed writes about Israeli pulp magazines and paperbacks of the 1950s and 1960s with a special focus on the pirated Tarzan books popular among Israeli youth at the time which were published anonymously and without authorization from the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs. In 2000, Eshed published a limited edition of "Tarzan in the Holy Land", a history of Tarzan in Hebrew with illustrations.
In 2002, Eshed published "From Tarzan to Zbeng" about the pulp literature of Israel. This book became a best seller and earned Eshed the title "Writer of the Year" from Maariv. He also researched the adventures of pulp icons such as Patrick Kim, a fictional Korean CIA agent who uses karate against a variety of enemies worldwide.
In 2003, Eshed co-published "The Golem: A Story of an Israeli Comicbook" with Israeli comics artist Uri Fink. The Golem is a Hebrew super-hero who works alongside a beautiful woman super-heroine, Lilith.
The book traces the history of the series since the 1940s, when it was drawn by the young comics artist Jack Kirby (Jacob Kurtzberg in that alternative reality), who immigrated to Palestine. The Golem collaborates with real-life Israeli personalities like Yitzhak Rabin, Moshe Dayan and Ariel Sharon, as well as fictional characters like Tarzan and well-known Israeli fictional heroes like Danny Din the invisible boy. Gil Biderman created a song and an animated clip sung by award-winning artist Yasmin Even about the Golem’s adventures. Both imitate the style of the 1970s.
Though imaginary, the book is based on real events and personalities in the world of Hebrew popular culture, featuring Pinchas Sadeh, Asher Dickstein, and Etgar Keret. Israeli literary critic Menachem Ben called it“a master work of Israeli mythology,“ and screenwriter and producer Alon Rozenblum called it "a must-have book in every home."

Timeline of the American Old West

This timeline of the American Old West is a chronologically ordered list of events significant to the development of the American West as a region of the continental United States. The term "American Old West" refers to a vast geographical area and lengthy time period of imprecise boundaries, and historians' definitions vary. The events in this timeline occurred primarily in the portion of the modern continental United States west of the Mississippi River, and mostly in the period between the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the admission of the last western territories as states in 1912 where most of the frontier was already settled and became urbanized; a few typical frontier episodes happened after that, such as the admission of Alaska into the Union in 1959. A brief section summarizing early exploration and settlement prior to 1803 is included to provide a foundation for later developments. Rarely, events significant to the history of the West but which occurred within the modern boundaries of Canada and Mexico are included as well.
Western North America was inhabited for millennia by various groups of Native Americans and later served as a frontier to the Spanish Empire, which began colonizing the region starting in the 16th century. British, French, and Russian claims followed in the 18th and 19th centuries, though these did not result in settlement and the region remained in Spanish hands. After the American Revolution, the newly independent United States began securing its own frontier from the Appalachian Mountains westward for settlement and economic investment by American pioneers. The long history of American expansion into these lands has played a central role in shaping American culture, iconography, and the modern national identity, and remains a popular topic for study by scholars and historians.
Events listed below are notable developments for the region as a whole, not just for a particular state or smaller subdivision of the region; as historians Hine and Faragher put it, they "tell the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the lands, the development of markets, and the formation of states... It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures."
Early exploration and settlement.
For almost three centuries after Columbus' voyages to the New World, much of western North America remained unsettled by white colonists, despite various territorial claims made by European colonial powers. European interest in the vast territory was initially motivated by the search for precious metals, especially gold, and the fur trade, with miners, trappers, and hunters among the first people of European descent to permanently settle in the West. The early years were also a period of scientific exploration and survey, such that by 1830 the rough outline of the western half of the continent had been mapped to the Pacific Ocean.

The Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway Depot is a historic Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway (CH&amp;N) depot in Boca Grande, Florida. It is located at Park and 4th Streets. The station was built by the CH&amp;N in 1910; the railroad's parent company, the American Agriculture and Chemical Company, had several phosphate mines in the area and wanted a railroad to ship its phosphate and other goods. The company played an important role in Boca Grande's early development, both by building the railroad and station and by opening a hotel and selling land. The station continued service when the railroad was acquired by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in the 1920s. Rail service began to diminish during the Great Depression, and later during the post-World War II period, when it closed in 1958. Until its closure, the railroad was the only land connection between Boca Grande and mainland Florida.
On December 13, 1979, the station was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Since 1985, the station has been a notable landmark along the Boca Grande Bike Path.

Mercury Fur

Mercury Fur is a play written by Philip Ridley which premiered in 2005. It is Ridley's fifth adult stage play and premiered at the Plymouth Theatre Royal, before moving to the Menier Chocolate Factory in London.
Set against the backdrop of a dystopian London, the narrative focuses on a party at which the torture and murder of a child is the main entertainment.
The original production was directed by John Tiffany as part of the "This Other England" season of new writing by Paines Plough and Theatre Royal, Plymouth in England. The part of Elliot was played by Ben Whishaw, who during the previous year had achieved fame and an Olivier Award Nomination for Best Actor for his performance as Hamlet.
The play is particularly noted for being the subject of controversy: Ridley's publisher, Faber and Faber, refused to publish the script and the original production received regular walkouts from audience members along with a generally divided and sometimes hostile response from critics. Over time, "Mercury Fur" has generally attracted a much more positive reception, with some critics even hailing the play as a "masterpiece".
The play is the first entry in Ridley's unofficially titled "Brothers Trilogy", being followed by "Leaves of Glass" and "Piranha Heights".
Ridley dedicated the play to his agent Rod Hall, who was murdered in May 2004. According to Ridley, the dedication was not originally made in response to Hall's death as it had been arranged some time prior to when Hall was killed.
Story.
"Mercury Fur" is set in a post-apocalyptic version of London's East End, where gang violence and drugs - in the form of hallucinogenic butterflies - terrorize the community. The protagonists are a gang of youths surviving by their wits. They deal the butterflies, selling them to their addicted customers from locations such as the now burnt-out British Museum. Their main source of income, however, is holding parties for wealthy clients in which their wildest, most amoral fantasies are brought to life.
The play, during nearly two uninterrupted hours, centres on a party which revolves around the sadistic murder of a child, enacted according to the whims of a guest. The gang ultimately has to face the question of how far they are willing to go to save the people they love.
Characters.
Elliot - The main facilitator in preparing the parties as well as being the chief dealer in butterflies which he sells in an ice cream van. He however has only ever taken one, meaning he has retained all his memories from before the butterflies arrived. He hurls a great deal of verbal abuse at Darren but also shows genuine love for him.
Darren - Elliot's brother and assistant. He is addicted to the butterflies which have resulted in him having memory loss.
Naz - An orphan who is a regular customer of Elliot's. Like many of the other characters has severe memory loss through butterfly addiction. Happens across the party by accident and wants to help the gang, much to the dismay of Elliot.
Party Piece - A ten-year-old boy. He is the victim prepared for the Party Guest.
Lola - Skilled in using make-up and designing costumes, which is utilised for the parties. Lola wears feminine clothing and is physically male in appearance. It is not specified in the play if Lola is a transgender woman or a transvestite man (in the play-text Lola is referred to by the "he" pronoun in the stage directions). In 2015 Ridley was asked at a Q&amp;A why the character of Lola is not portrayed by "a female actor". He responded to this by saying that the reason was because "he's transgender, at that stage of transgender he's a... he's a male. […] He's born male and he identifies as a woman."
Spinx - The leader of the gang and Lola's brother. He looks after the Duchess with whom it is suggested he has an intimate relationship with. The rest of the gang are mostly fearful of him.
Duchess - A frail and blind woman. She gets her name from being deceived into thinking that she is a duchess of a country. Her belief in this is maintained through her having to rely on the accounts of others as to her situation due to her blindness. She has also mixed up her life history with the character of Maria from "The Sound of Music". It is heavily suggested that she may have a closer connection to Elliot and Darren than it initially appears.
Party Guest - The party revolves around enacting his own violent sexual fantasy against a child.
Rejected publication from Faber and Faber.
Before the play received its premiere Ridley's publisher Faber and Faber (who had published the majority of his previous plays) refused to publish the play-text of "Mercury Fur".
Ridley has said that he was told that Faber had "objected to the play because of its cruelty to children" and that what he had written "had gone too far". This reasoning was felt to be somewhat ironic as Faber’s decision to refuse publication was relayed to Ridley by phone whilst he was watching footage on his TV of the Beslan school siege, which claimed the lives of over 330 children. Ridley has stated that "The first comment that the editor at Faber said to me was, “I've got to tell you that several people here are seriously offended by this.” I have a thing about dialogue, so I remember. Those were her words. It was as if they'd all suddenly turned into a bunch of Cardinal Wolseys, deciding what was right and wrong. It's not their job to be moral arbiters; it's their job to publish. I think Faber realised they couldn't say this, so after a few weeks they decided to rephrase it as, 'It's a piece of writing that I do not admire.'" Ridley also states that "There was no discussion. I wasn't invited in to clarify my intentions. I sent them a letter saying I thought they had misread it, but they didn't want a discussion. Of course I'm upset, but it is not just an ego thing. If a publisher is saying, 'You've gone too far', what kind of message is that sending out to writers?"
As a result, Ridley parted ways with Faber and joined Methuen, who published "Mercury Fur" instead.
Initial reception and controversy.
The play became a theatrical cause célèbre when it premiered, with walkouts reported each night of the show's original run.
Although most critics praised the production’s acting and direction, Ridley’s script was very divisive.
Critics were especially split regarding the play’s depiction of cruelty, which was condemned by some as gratuitous and sensationalist in nature. Matthew Sweet wrote that the play had content that "seemed little more than a questionable authorial indulgence - an exercise in exploitative camp" that reduced "the sensitivity of the audience until they began to find such images [of cruelty] ludicrous and tiresome". Charles Spencer was highly critical, describing "Mercury Fur" as "the most violent and upsetting new play" of the last ten years, adding that "It positively revels in imaginative nastiness" and condemning it as "a poisonous piece". He went on to declare that everyone involved with the production had been "degraded" and, more controversially, that Ridley was "turned on by his own sick fantasies."
In contrast, the play’s violent content was defended by a variety of reviewers. Kate Bassett wrote that "One might complain that Ridley is a puerile shock jock [or] wonder if the playwright isn't indulging in his own nasty fantasies or even encouraging copycat sadism […] Ridley is writing in the tradition of Greek and Jacobean tragedies. He underlines that brutality warps, suggests that love and morals persist, and is deliberately creating a nightmare scenario rife with allusions to actual world news." Other critics felt that the play justified any shock or offense it might cause. "The Independent"'s Paul Taylor wrote that "the play has the right to risk toying with being offensive to bring home just how morally unsettling this depraved, perverted-kicks world has become. If you could sit through it unaffronted on the artistic level, it would surely have failed in its mission." Likewise, John Peter wrote that "Ridley is an observer, shocked and conscientious, as appalled as you are. But he understands the mechanics of cruelty and the minds of people who are fascinated by cruelty and take an obscure pleasure in moralising about it. Ridley doesn't moralise, but he expects you to respond, and he delivers a moral shock." Some other critics also felt that the play contained moral content, such as Aleks Sierz who called it "a very moral play, in which the bad end badly, and the good go down tragically".
Some critics saw political resonances in the play along with allusions to real-world events. "The Herald"'s Carole Woddis wrote that "Ridley’s upsetting portrayal is, I believe, an honourable response to the genocides in Rwanda and atrocities in Iraq". John Peter declared that "Philip Ridley has written the ultimate 9/11 play: a play for the age of Bush and Bin Laden, of Donald Rumsfeld and Charles Clarke; a play for our time, when a sense of terror is both nameless and precise." However, Paul Taylor found that "the political context is too conveniently hazy", and John Gross wrote that "any political arguments are lost amid the sadistic fantasies, kinky rituals, gruesome anecdotes and flights of science fiction", with similar comments coming from Brian Logan: "whatever questions playwright Philip Ridley seeks to pose are drowned out by the shrieking and bloodshed".
Critics were also split on the credibility of the play’s world and its speculative depiction of societal collapse. Michael Billington was critical, stating that he distrusted the play "from its reactionary despair and assumption that we are all going to hell in a handcart" along with writing that it succumbed "to a fashionable nihilism" and that Ridley’s portrayal of social-breakdown "flies in the face of a mass of evidence one could produce to the contrary." In contrast, Alastair Macaulay described the play as a "realistic nightmare" which portrayed "a kind of believable hell […] like the darkest parallel-universe version of the world we know". Aleks Sierz felt that the play’s conclusion was "utterly convincing, even if - in our liberal souls - it seems like a wild exaggeration." In contrast Brian Logan wrote that "I never really believed in ‘Mercury Fur’. Its futuristic setting is more hypothetical than real; it also absolves the audience of moral complicity", whilst John Peter wrote that "most science fiction is moral fiction".
Various critics went on to compare the play to other controversial works, particularly "A Clockwork Orange" and the plays of Sarah Kane. Some even went as far as to voice concern for the wellbeing for the young actor portraying The Party Piece or thought that the play might make audience members vomit.
Despite this, there were critics that were especially supportive. Alastair Macaulay described the play as "an amazing feat of imagination, engrossing and poetic" whilst Aleks Sierz wrote that the play "makes you feel alive when you're watching it" and declared it to be "probably the best new play of the year". John Peter urged people to see it: "It is a play you need to see for its diagnosis of a terror-stricken and belligerent civilization. I recommend it strongly to the strong in heart."
The critical discordance resulted in some critics being at odds with each other. Having enjoyed the show, critic Miranda Sawyer wrote that she felt "despair" from the negative reviews from "proper" theatre critics and wondered "Where are the theatre critics that speak for me and those like me?" She went on to say that there would be no "room for every type of play in Britain" if critics "remain fuddy-duddies [and] continue to discourage new writing that they don't understand". Sawyer’s comments were challenged by critic Ian Shuttleworth who felt that she implied that the critical divide was generational, which he disputed by citing older critics who defended the play.
In defending the production, director John Tiffany explained that although the play is full of "incredibly shocking images and stories, almost all the violence happens off stage. It is almost Greek in its ambition" and that the play is "the product of a diseased world, not a diseased mind".
Responding to the critical backlash, Ridley described the critics as "blinder than a bagful of moles in a coal cellar", a comment partially made in reference to him witnessing the critic Charles Spencer fall over furniture onstage while trying to find his seat on the play's press night. Ridley went on to argue that theatre in Britain "is the only art form that I can think of where you feel you are in direct conflict with the people who are trying to judge your work" and stated that there was "a serious disconnection between the artists who are working and are trying to move an art movement forward and those who are putting judgement of those artists […] I see it in work of other artists in which it is being inhibited, and this is sending out terrible signals". These and other comments Ridley made about his critics were condemned as "impressively bilious" and "crassly malicious" by "Theatre Record" editor Ian Shuttleworth.
Defending the play, Ridley expressed what he felt were double standards within the theatrical establishment, in that it is acceptable for there to be scenes of violence in classical drama but not within contemporary plays: 
"Why is it that it is fine for the classic plays to discuss - even show - these things, but people are outraged when contemporary playwrights do it? If you go to see "King Lear", you see a man having his eyes pulled out; in "Medea", a woman slaughters her own children. The recent revival of "Iphigenia" at the National was acclaimed for its relevance. But when you try to write about the world around us, people get upset. If I'd wrapped "Mercury Fur" up as a recently rediscovered Greek tragedy it would be seen as an interesting moral debate like "Iphigenia", but because it is set on an east-London housing estate it is seen as being too dangerous to talk about. What does that say about the world we live in? What does it say about theatre today?"
Ridley also explained that he felt critics had disliked "Mercury Fur" because of its subject matter and not for the theatrical experience the play is trying to create for its audience: 
"I don’t think there is anything wrong with people being disturbed within the theatre at all… I think theatre is fifteen years behind any other art form… It’s still perceived as a kind of subject matter based art form. You wouldn’t go along and look at a Cézanne painting and criticize it just on the choice of apples he’s chosen to paint, you’d criticize it, and you’d judge it and experience it for the use of paint… Because we come from a basic literal tradition we still view stage plays as kind of glorified novels and we judge them purely on their subject matter, regardless of the theatrical experience of sitting there and watching the play." 
Ridley also defended the depiction of violence within the story, arguing that it is used for a moral purpose and that the play is more about love than violence:
"The things that happen in "Mercury Fur" are not gratuitous, they are heart-breaking. The people may do terrible things but everything they do is out of love, in an attempt to keep each other safe. The play is me asking, 'What would I do in that position?' If you knew that to keep your mother, brother and lover safe, you would have to do terrible things, would you still do them? That's the dilemma of the play. It asks us all, 'What lengths would you go to to save the people you love?'"
Despite this controversy – or perhaps because of it – the play sold out on its initial run and, by the end, was playing to an enthusiastic young audience.
2010 police incident.
In 2010 police almost raided Theatre Delicatessen's production of the play (which was staged in a derelict office block) when a resident living next door believed the play's violent scenes were being carried out for real. Actors waiting offstage along with the company's producer intervened before the police would have stopped the performance. The theatre company's joint-artistic director Jessica Brewster explained that the neighbour "heard a lot of noise on the fire escape [of the building] which was basically off-stage fighting [...] she called the police, the police came in [and] as they were coming in the gun [onstage] went off, so we kind of had the police storming round the back and a very flustered producer trying to calm everyone down. It was very quickly solved but, yeah it was, it was a slight worry for about half an hour."
Behind the Eyes.
In February 2011 the play was used by the Schema Arts Collective as the basis for a community arts project called "Behind the Eyes", which took place at the Sassoon Gallery, London.
The project featured an amateur production of "Mercury Fur" which was cut down to 40 minutes and used actors from the local area. The performance was particular in its use of sound design with edited audio recordings of the actors and gallery environment incorporated into the production.
The project also featured a thirty-minute documentary film "Mercury Fur Unveiled" about the cast and creative team's process of realising the project and their views on the play. The documentary was later broadcast on the Community Channel in 2013 and is free to watch online.
"Behind the Eyes" also displayed artwork inspired by the play with a large mural of a shark (which was also utilised as the production's scenic backdrop) and Ridley himself collaborated by exhibiting a series of photographic portraits he had created of the cast.
2012 revival.
In 2012 the play was arguably critically reassessed when revived by The Greenhouse Theatre Company, with the production receiving extremely positive reviews and even marketed as "Ridley’s Masterpiece", a statement which was also made by critic Aleks Sierz and "A Younger Theatre" reviewer Jack Orr.
The play also drew attention for its relevance in the aftermath of the 2011 England Riots with the production's online trailer using dialogue from the play over footage from the riots.
New monologues.
For the 2012 production, Ridley wrote four individual new monologues for the characters Elliot, Naz, Lola and Darren which were filmed and put on The Greenhouse Theatre Company's YouTube channel to promote the play transferring to the West End.
Legacy and influence.
On seeing the original production, dramaturg and theatre director Lisa Goldman described the play as "one of the greatest theatre experiences of my life" which led to her commissioning and directing Ridley's next two plays "Leaves of Glass" and "Piranha Heights".
Mark Ravenhill (a playwright who is generally recognised for his 1996 in-yer-face play "Shopping and Fucking") named "Mercury Fur" as "the best play" he had seen in 2005.
The playwright Lou Ramsden has described the play as a major influence on her work, stating that "nothing changed my theatrical outlook quite like [the] first production of "Mercury Fur" at the Menier Chocolate factory… It showed me that I could do more than just picture a stage – I could use the circumstances of the theatre as well. The fact that the audience were in an inescapable black box served to ramp up the tension of the play, to unbearable levels... My heart literally pounded. I was thrilled by the revelation that theatre could be more than just an exercise in language, or a nice, polite, passively watched story – it could elicit a physical reaction, giving people a horrifyingly visceral roller-coaster ride." Ramsden has cited how this experience of hers informed the writing of her 2010 play "Breed" and her 2011 play "Hundreds and Thousands".
Ridley has described "Mercury Fur" as a turning point in his career as a playwright: "After "Mercury Fur", the work reinvented itself. It was as if people saw [my plays] for the first time. A whole new generation of younger directors came along – and they all just got it. In the past, I had to go into rehearsals [of my plays] and explain what I was doing. Then it was as if somebody flicked a switch and suddenly that changed."
Plays that critics believe have been influenced by or bear homage to "Mercury Fur" include:
Productions.
"Mercury Fur" has been performed worldwide in countries such as Australia, France, Italy, Malta, Turkey, the Czech Republic, the United States and Japan.

Blood Done Sign My Name

Blood Done Sign My Name (2004) is a historical memoir written by Timothy B. Tyson. He explores the 1970 murder of Henry D. Marrow, a black man in Tyson's then hometown of Oxford, North Carolina. The murder is described as the result of the complicated collision of the Black Power movement and the white backlash against public school integration and other changes brought by the civil rights movement.
Since 2004, the book has sold 160,000 copies. It has earned several awards: the Grawemeyer Award in Religion from the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, which had a $200,000 prize, the Southern Book Award for Nonfiction from the Southern Book Critics Circle, the Christopher Award, and the North Caroliniana Book Award from the North Caroliniana Society. It was also a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill selected the book for its 2005 summer reading program.
The book was adapted as a movie by the same name, released in 2010. "Entertainment Weekly" ranked it on a "must see" list.
Story.
Tyson has said that the title comes from a slave spiritual later sung as a "blues lament", particularly this phrase: "Ain't you glad, ain't you glad, that the blood done sign my name?"
The book explores the effects of the 1970 killing of Henry Marrow, a 23-year-old black Vietnam War veteran in Oxford, North Carolina. This is the county seat of Granville County, a center of tobacco culture. Then a town of 10,000, it is located north of Durham. Three white men were indicted on charges of murder, but they were acquitted at trial by an all-white jury. Black protests of the killing and acquittal included acts of arson and violence.
Black people organized a protest march to the state capital of Raleigh. In addition, they conducted an 18-month boycott of white businesses in Oxford, a mostly segregated town, to force integration in public facilities. The Marrow case helped galvanize continued African-American civil rights activities in Oxford and across the eastern North Carolina black belt.
Local civil rights activist Ben Chavis took a lead role in these activities; he led the march to the capital and the boycott of local businesses. The Marrow killing and related events radicalized the African-American freedom struggle in North Carolina, which was trying to gain progress after the successful passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s. Racial conflict in Wilmington, North Carolina resulted in the burning of a grocery store. The Wilmington Ten cases resulted from charges against Ben Chavis and nine other black men in this incident. Several of the men were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms. They were eventually freed on an appeal. In the 1990s Chavis was selected as the youngest executive director of the NAACP in its history. He later was an organizer of the Million Man March.
Tyson lived as a child in Oxford, where his father was the minister of the prominent Oxford United Methodist Church. He explores not only the white supremacy of the South's racial caste system but his personal and family stories. (His father was driven out of the church because of his support for civil rights.) Tyson interweaves a narrative of the story and its effects on him, with a discussion of the racial history of North Carolina and the United States, and the violent realities of that history on both sides of the color line.
He explores the persistence of discrimination years after passage of federal laws to enforce civil rights, and the more complex aspects of the later civil rights movement.
Reception.
"Entertainment Weekly" praised its "deadpan, merciless self-examination" and said it "pulses with vital paradox... It's a detached dissertation, a damning dark-night-of-the-white-soul, and a ripping yarn, all united by Tyson's powerful voice, a brainy, booming Bubba profundo." Historian Jane Dailey, writing in the "Chicago Tribune", called it "Admirable and unexpected... a riveting story that will have its readers weeping with both laughter and sorrow."
Adaptations.
The book was adapted as a film written and directed by writer Jeb Stuart. It was released in 2010, starring Ricky Schroder, Omar Benson Miller, and Michael Rooker. It was filmed in the cities of Shelby, Statesville, Monroe and Gastonia, North Carolina. The African-American historian John Hope Franklin has a cameo in the film.
It was also adapted as a play of the same name by Mike Wiley, which premiered at Duke University in 2008. It was also produced at the city hall in Oxford, North Carolina, on February 13, 2009.

National Recording Preservation Board

The United States National Recording Preservation Board selects recorded sounds for preservation in the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry. The National Recording Registry was initiated to maintain and preserve "sound recordings that are culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"; to be eligible, recordings must be at least ten years old. Members of the Board also advise the Librarian of Congress on ongoing development and implementation of the national recorded sound preservation program.
The National Recording Preservation Board (NRPB) is a federal agency located within the Library of Congress. The NRPB was established by the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106–474). This legislation also created both the National Recording Registry and the non-profit National Recording Preservation Foundation, which is loosely affiliated with the National Recording Preservation Board, but the private-sector Foundation (NRPF) and federal Board (NRPB) are separate, legally distinct entities.
The main responsibilities of the board are:
Organization.
The board is appointed by the Librarian of Congress and is composed of representatives from professional organizations of composers, musicians, musicologists, librarians, archivists and the recording industry. Explicitly it is composed of up to 5 "at-large" members and 17 member/alternate pairs from the following 17 organizations:

Thant Myint-U

Thant Myint-U ( ; born 31 January 1966) is an historian, writer, grandson of former United Nations Secretary-General U Thant, former UN official, former Myanmar peace process mediator, and an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. He has authored five books, including "The River of Lost Footsteps: A Personal History of Burma" and "Where China Meets India: Burma and the New Crossroads of Asia." He founded the Yangon Heritage Trust in 2012 to protect built heritage and promote urban planning in the Burmese commercial capital of Yangon. He is also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at Christ's College, Cambridge and United Nations Special Adviser on Humanitarian Diplomacy.
Life and education.
Thant Myint-U was born in New York City to Burmese parents. He grew up in Riverdale, Bronx at the home of his maternal grandfather, the then-Secretary-General of the United Nations U Thant. From 1971 to 1980, he studied at Riverdale Country School, a private college-preparatory day school in Bronx. He graduated from International School Bangkok in 1983. He has three sisters.
Thant earned a B.A. in government and economics from Harvard University, an MA in international relations and international economics from Johns Hopkins University, and his PhD in history from Cambridge University in 1996. From 1996 to 1999, he was a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he taught history.
Career.
He served on three UN peacekeeping operations. He first served as a human rights officer from 1992 to 1993 at the UN Transitional Authority for Cambodia in Phnom Penh. In 1994, he was the spokesman for the UN Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia, based in Sarajevo. In 1996, he was a political adviser in the Office of the UN's Special Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In 2000, he joined the UN Secretariat in New York. He worked first at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, then at the United Nations Department of Political Affairs, and at the Policy Planning Unit as a chief in 2004. During this time, he was a member of the secretariat of the Secretary-General's Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change (High Level Threat Panel). From the late 2005 to early 2006, he was briefly a senior officer at the Executive Office of the Secretary-General.
Aside from being chairman of the Yangon Heritage Trust, he was, from 2011 to 2015, a member of the National Economic and Social Advisory Council, special adviser to the Myanmar government for the peace process at the Myanmar Peace Centre, senior research fellow of the Myanmar Development Resources Institute, and member of the Fund Board of the (Myanmar) Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund.
During a December 2019 book tour in the US, Thant expressed his forebodings about Myanmar's future. In an interview with Singapore's "The Straits Times", Thant remarked that the threat of climate change made him pessimistic about the country's future. "I think whatever we think of the [Myanmar's] ledger in general, perhaps it comes to 50/50," he said. "When you add on what is almost certainly going to be the impact of global climate change on Burma, I think it's hard to be too optimistic right now."
Works.
Thant has written extensively for "The New York Times", "The Washington Post", the "Los Angeles Times" the "International Herald Tribune", the "London Review of Books", the "New Statesman", the "Far Eastern Economic Review", "Time" and "The Times Literary Supplement".

Biodiversity informatics

Biodiversity informatics is the application of informatics techniques to biodiversity information, such as taxonomy, biogeography or ecology. It is defined as the application of Information technology technologies to management, algorithmic exploration, analysis and interpretation of primary data regarding life, particularly at the species level organization. Modern computer techniques can yield new ways to view and analyze existing information, as well as predict future situations (see niche modelling). Biodiversity informatics is a term that was only coined around 1992 but with rapidly increasing data sets has become useful in numerous studies and applications, such as the construction of taxonomic databases or geographic information systems. Biodiversity informatics contrasts with "bioinformatics", which is often used synonymously with the computerized handling of data in the specialized area of molecular biology.
Overview.
Biodiversity informatics (different but linked to bioinformatics) is the application of information technology methods to the problems of organizing, accessing, visualizing and analyzing primary biodiversity data. Primary biodiversity data is composed of names, observations and records of specimens, and genetic and morphological data associated to a specimen. Biodiversity informatics may also have to cope with managing information from unnamed taxa such as that produced by environmental sampling and sequencing of mixed-field samples. The term biodiversity informatics is also used to cover the computational problems specific to the names of biological entities, such as the development of algorithms to cope with variant representations of identifiers such as species names and authorities, and the multiple classification schemes within which these entities may reside according to the preferences of different workers in the field, as well as the syntax and semantics by which the content in taxonomic databases can be made machine queryable and interoperable for biodiversity informatics purposes...
History of the discipline.
Biodiversity Informatics can be considered to have commenced with the construction of the first computerized taxonomic databases in the early 1970s, and progressed through subsequent developing of distributed search tools towards the late 1990s including the Species Analyst from Kansas University, the North American Biodiversity Information Network NABIN, CONABIO in Mexico, INBio in Costa Rica, and others, the establishment of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility in 2001, and the parallel development of a variety of niche modelling and other tools to operate on digitized biodiversity data from the mid-1980s onwards (e.g. see ). In September 2000, the U.S. journal "Science" devoted a special issue to "Bioinformatics for Biodiversity", the journal "Biodiversity Informatics" commenced publication in 2004, and several international conferences through the 2000s have brought together biodiversity informatics practitioners, including the London e-Biosphere conference in June 2009. A supplement to the journal "BMC Bioinformatics" (Volume 10 Suppl 14) published in November 2009 also deals with biodiversity informatics.
History of the term.
According to correspondence reproduced by Walter Berendsohn, the term "Biodiversity Informatics" was coined by John Whiting in 1992 to cover the activities of an entity known as the Canadian Biodiversity Informatics Consortium, a group involved with fusing basic biodiversity information with environmental economics and geospatial information in the form of GPS and GIS. Subsequently, it appears to have lost any obligate connection with the GPS/GIS world and be associated with the computerized management of any aspects of biodiversity information (e.g. see )
Digital taxonomy (systematics).
Global list of all species.
One major goal for biodiversity informatics is the creation of a complete master list of currently recognised species of the world. This goal has been achieved to a large extent by the Catalogue of Life project which lists &gt;2 million species in its 2022 Annual Checklist. A similar effort for fossil taxa, the Paleobiology Database documents some 100,000+ names for fossil species, out of an unknown total number.
Genus and species scientific names as unique identifiers.
Application of the Linnaean system of binomial nomenclature for species, and uninomials for genera and higher ranks, has led to many advantages but also problems with homonyms (the same name being used for multiple taxa, either inadvertently or legitimately across multiple kingdoms), synonyms (multiple names for the same taxon), as well as variant representations of the same name due to orthographic differences, minor spelling errors, variation in the manner of citation of author names and dates, and more. In addition, names can change through time on account of changing taxonomic opinions (for example, the correct generic placement of a species, or the elevation of a subspecies to species rank or vice versa), and also the circumscription of a taxon can change according to different authors' taxonomic concepts. One proposed solution to this problem is the usage of Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) for machine-machine communication purposes, although there are both proponents and opponents of this approach.
A consensus classification of organisms.
Organisms can be classified in a multitude of ways (see main page Biological classification), which can create design problems for Biodiversity Informatics systems aimed at incorporating either a single or multiple classification to suit the needs of users, or to guide them towards a single "preferred" system. Whether a single consensus classification system can ever be achieved is probably an open question, however the Catalogue of Life has commissioned activity in this area which has been succeeded by a published system proposed in 2015 by M.

Biodiversity maps provide a cartographic representation of spatial biodiversity data. This data can be used in conjunction with Species Checklists to help with biodiversity conservation efforts. Biodiversity maps can help reveal patterns of species distribution and range changes. This may reflect biodiversity loss, habitat degradation, or changes in species composition. Combined with urban development data, maps can inform land management by modeling scenarios which might impact biodiversity.
Biodiversity maps can be produced in a variety of ways: traditionally range maps were hand-drawn based on literature reports but increasingly large-scale data, e.g. from citizen science projects (e.g. iNaturalist) and digitized museum collections (e.g. VertNet) are used. GIS tools such as ArcGIS or R packages such as dismo can specifically aid in species distribution modeling (ecological niche modeling) and even predict impacts of ecological change on biodiversity. GBIF, OBIS, and IUCN are large web-based repositories of species spatial-temporal data that source many existing biodiversity maps.
Mobilizing primary biodiversity information.
"Primary" biodiversity information can be considered the basic data on the occurrence and diversity of species (or indeed, any recognizable taxa), commonly in association with information regarding their distribution in either space, time, or both. Such information may be in the form of retained specimens and associated information, for example as assembled in the natural history collections of museums and herbaria, or as observational records, for example either from formal faunal or floristic surveys undertaken by professional biologists and students, or as amateur and other planned or unplanned observations including those increasingly coming under the scope of citizen science. Providing online, coherent digital access to this vast collection of disparate primary data is a core Biodiversity Informatics function that is at the heart of regional and global biodiversity data networks, examples of the latter including OBIS and GBIF.
As a secondary source of biodiversity data, relevant scientific literature can be parsed either by humans or (potentially) by specialized information retrieval algorithms to extract the relevant primary biodiversity information that is reported therein, sometimes in aggregated / summary form but frequently as primary observations in narrative or tabular form. Elements of such activity (such as extracting key taxonomic identifiers, keywording / index terms, etc.) have been practiced for many years at a higher level by selected academic databases and search engines. However, for the maximum Biodiversity Informatics value, the actual primary occurrence data should ideally be retrieved and then made available in a standardized form or forms; for example both the Plazi and INOTAXA projects are transforming taxonomic literature into XML formats that can then be read by client applications, the former using TaxonX-XML and the latter using the taXMLit format. The Biodiversity Heritage Library is also making significant progress in its aim to digitize substantial portions of the out-of-copyright taxonomic literature, which is then subjected to optical character recognition (OCR) so as to be amenable to further processing using biodiversity informatics tools.
Standards and protocols.
In common with other data-related disciplines, Biodiversity Informatics benefits from the adoption of appropriate standards and protocols in order to support machine-machine transmission and interoperability of information within its particular domain. Examples of relevant standards include the Darwin Core XML schema for specimen- and observation-based biodiversity data developed from 1998 onwards, plus extensions of the same, Taxonomic Concept Transfer Schema, plus standards for Structured Descriptive Data, and Access to Biological Collection Data (ABCD); while data retrieval and transfer protocols include DiGIR (now mostly superseded) and TAPIR (TDWG Access Protocol for Information Retrieval). Many of these standards and protocols are currently maintained, and their development overseen, by Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG).
Current activities.
At the 2009 e-Biosphere conference in the U.K., the following themes were adopted, which is indicative of a broad range of current Biodiversity Informatics activities and how they might be categorized:
A post-conference workshop of key persons with current significant Biodiversity Informatics roles also resulted in a Workshop Resolution that stressed, among other aspects, the need to create durable, global registries for the resources that are basic to biodiversity informatics (e.g., repositories, collections); complete the construction of a solid taxonomic infrastructure; and create ontologies for biodiversity data.

Plant City Union Depot

The Plant City Union Depot is a historic train depot in Plant City, Florida, Florida, United States. It was built in 1909 and was crucial in the development of Plant City. The city was named after Henry Plant, who introduced railway lines to improve the transport system in Central and Western Florida. The architectural design is credited to J.F. Leitner.
It is located 102 N. Palmer street near Northeast Drane Street, and was built by the Plant Railroad System and the Florida Navigation and Rail Co., which later became the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) and Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL). These two lines became more commonly known as the “A Line” and “S Line” after the two railroads merged, which happened when the depot was still operational. The ACL tracks ran east and west. The SAL tracks ran north and south and contained a Railway Express Agency loading dock. The southbound station served ACL trains bound for Tampa and Sarasota and the other station served SAL trains bound for Sarasota, Boca Grande, Naples and Miami.
Plant City Union Depot continued to operate until 1971. It was about to get torn down by the city in 1974, but was saved Plant City Arts Council. On April 14, 1975, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S Department of Interior.
Plant City Union Depot was converted into and renamed as the Robert W. Willaford Railroad Museum in September 2013 and is open to the public. It is named after Robert W. Willaford in honor of his contributions to this conversion project and his dedication towards trains.
History.
When operational, the busy station was accommodating about 44 passenger trains daily. The line was held active by many important figures who travelled along it. The military also took this line to depart for their missions. It was characterized as one of the largest railroad distribution stop and was ranked as the second busiest transportation hub in the state of Florida, Jacksonville being the first. Its strategic location was what determined its important role in the area. It is known that farmers shipped nearly 4 million quarts of strawberries in 1926 through the station itself. The uniqueness of the station was that farmers used it to pay their buyers directly on the station while selling their produce. The introduction of trucks slowed the station's activity to a halt. Once it stopped operating, the railroad was deeded to the city four years later. It was then attributed the title of historic monument and was under the control of the Plant City Art Council.
Passenger service.
The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad used the station for its "West Coast Champion," bound for Tampa and Sarasota and unnamed trains heading in the same direction.
The Seaboard Air Line used it for its Wildwood to St. Petersburg division. SAL trains serving the station included the "Palmland," "Silver Meteor" and the "Sunland."
Restoration.
Plant City union depot was restored numerous times with the support of multiple grants allotted, after being listed in the National Register of Historic Places. One major change was to move the two-story tower from the station across the tracks and was completed in April 1987. The idea of adding a restaurant was proposed but not finalized. Some rooms were also restored to serve as art classes for the community. These were made possible from the funds raised by the art council. In 1988, work was performed on the exterior structure of the building with some minor alterations in the interior. In 1997, more grants were given to install bathrooms and air conditioning system. In 2014, the station experienced a major restoration change that stayed till date.
Naming.
The name “union” was inherited after the merging of the two competing railroad companies, the Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line into the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in 1967. The station was reopened as museum and was renamed in a ceremony that was organized during the first Railfest in February 2014. It is now known as Robert W. Willaford Railroad Museum.
Robert W. Willaford Railroad Museum.
Robert W. Willaford is a retired locomotive engineer, best known in the community as Plant City’s railroad expert and for his passion towards train. His unique passion led him to keep a train engine and caboose on display in his yard for many years. He was contacted by the City Commissioner Mike Sparkman and told to make some donations in regards to trains. This was the start of the changes and restoration that happened till date. Willaford himself was unaware of what his contributions meant to the community. His contribution to this project was about 28 railroad items, ranging approximately $212 500, that he collected for nearly 43 years. He amassed and salvaged this collection from scrap yards coming from Miami, Georgia, Baltimore, Ohio, Vermont. In return to this contribution and after undertaking several negotiations, Willaford and the city agreed in renaming the new museum as the Robert W. Willaford Railroad Museum in February 2014.
Recent changes.
On November 14, 2013, the caboose along with the engine were moved to the actual site. Prior to the arrival of the train, C.J. Bridges Railroad Contractor installed tracks for the caboose. These changes were made under the supervision of the City Commissioner. The two-story building has been equipped with an elevator to give access for visitors with disabilities. A train platform has also been built to display some of the memorabilia that was donated earlier. The 24/7 viewing platform has been built for train enthusiasts to view the few operational trains still passing through Plant City. The brickwork has been renovated and a roof has been built. The platform's model was inspired from Georgia’s Folkston Funnel which is a train station with a similar viewing platform. The station will now have a scanner which record the transmissions between trains like the Folkston Funnel. Plant City's depot is bigger than that of Georgia's as it has a 14- foot tower and a lower deck platform.
Events.
Since the opening of the museum, events have been hosted for the public to participate in train-related topics. Each year a two-day Railfest is organized by the museum. The event is free, family friendly and open for rail fans. During the event, train-themed films are projected, free-museum admission is granted, scavenger hunts are organized, tours of the caboose are available and access to miniature train rides are arranged for visitors to enjoy. Each year the activities differ and new activities are organized. There are also fund-raising rallies organized throughout the year. In 2019 the Railfest was on Saturday 13 April. The money collected is used to maintain the collection and to pay the staff working during the week.

Valley of the Seven Castles

The Valley of the Seven Castles (; ) is an informal name given to the Äischdall, the valley of the Eisch river, in central Luxembourg. The valley stretches from the confluence with the Alzette upstream to Steinfort, on the border with Belgium. The entire route can be traversed in about an hour by car, starting near the town of Arlon on the Belgian/Luxembourg border. There is also a 37-kilometre footpath that takes hikers along the valley and past the castles.
It is named after the group of seven castles that line its route. Those seven castles are (in order, heading upstream):

Hans Hilfiker

Hans Hilfiker (15 September 1901 – 2 March 1993) was a Swiss engineer and designer. In 1944, working for the Swiss Federal Railways, he designed the Swiss railway clock, which became an international icon. The SBB clock was not the only contribution by Hilfiker to modern living. He developed the concept of the fitted kitchen and was responsible for the standard Swiss dimensions for kitchen components (55/60/90 cm).
Early life.
Hilfiker was born in Zurich, Switzerland on 15 September 1901. After attending primary and secondary school, Hilfiker completed an apprenticeship as a precision mechanic. He studied electrical and telecommunications engineering at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and gained a diploma.
Career.
Siemens.
Hilfiker began working for , a Siemens production plant in 1925. He was transferred to Argentina in 1926 and became technical advisor to the telecommunications troops of the Argentine Army until 1928. His tasks included building workshops and mobile telephone exchanges, while also training telecommunications non-commissioned officers. As a senior engineer, he was involved in the construction of the Buenos Aires - Rosario telephone line through the Paraná River in 1929. He planned a submarine cable running through the Río de la Plata to connect the Argentine and Uruguayan capitals in 1930. The same year, Hilfiker was transferred to Berlin and trained for the role of operating a Siemens subsidiary in Argentina. The plan however did not materialize and Hilfiker returned to Switzerland in 1931.
Swiss Federal Railways.
Hilfiker joined the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) as an engineer in construction department III in 1932. In his first year, he developed the first iteration of the later iconic Swiss railway clock. The version which was first displayed at the Bahnhofplatz (plaza) adjacent of Zürich Hauptbahnhof (Zürich Central Station) lacked the 'minute' and 'second' hands. Hilfiker would improve upon the design with the addition of a 'minute' hand in 1943. The following year, the SBB replaced all its clocks across the country in an effort to have a consistent clock face, which were all synchronized by a master clock linked to the telephone network. Hilfiker became deputy head of the construction department and head of the fixed electrical systems services. Among other things, he also designed a gantry crane to load heavy goods from the road onto the rail, the platform roof for Winterthur Grüze station, and a timetable projector for the Zurich station.
In 1955, Hilfiker launched the final iteration of the Swiss railway clock, which had been in development since 1952. A 'second' hand resembling a red signalling disk was added, which would pause slightly at the twelve o'clock mark, before jumping forward with the minute hand ("see illustration"). It became an international icon.
Therma AG.
Between 1958 and 1968, Hilfike was a director of Therma AG located in Schwanden of the canton of Glarus. He developed a completely new kitchen range for Therma that consisted of modules that could be combined with one another. Until then, Therma had been producing standalone devices. With these system kitchens, he laid the foundation for the Swiss kitchen standard SINK (Swiss Industrial Commission for the Standardization of Kitchens), which deviated from the European one (width 55 instead of 60 cm). A prototype based on this standard was shown at the EXPO 1964 in Lausanne. Hilfiker created an actual corporate design for Therma and restructured the manufacturing processes for the new fitted kitchens.
Death and legacy.
Hilfiker died in Locarno, Switzerland on 2 March 1993. The final iteration of his clock remains in use today and is a protected trademark of the SBB.

Lockman Foundation

The Lockman Foundation is a nonprofit, interdenominational Christian ministry dedicated to the translation, publication, and distribution of Bibles and other biblical resources in English and other languages. The foundation's core products are the New American Standard Bible and the Amplified Bible, both evolving from the 1901 American Standard Version. By 2009, the foundation had distributed about 25 million Bibles.
The foundation was established in 1942 by F. Dewey Lockman (1898–1974) and his wife Minna Lockman when they donated part of their citrus ranch in La Habra, California. 
Dewey Lockman led the foundation until his death, followed by Samuel Sutherland (1974–1979), and Robert Lambeth (1979–2017). Robert Lambeth was a donor to all six seminaries of the Southern Baptist Convention. 
The foundation reported assets of $13 million and employment of 12 staff for 2020. Pike Lambeth has served full time as executive vice-president since at least 2009.
The declared purpose of the foundation is “to foster and promote the Holy Bible as the inspired and inerrant word of God through Christian, charitable, and educational activities.” Its doctrinal statement, established early in the foundation's history, is closely aligned with fundamentalism. 
In common with most Bible translation projects, the foundation organized teams of scholars and pastors for the task. The Amplified translation of the Gospel of John was published first, in 1958, and the full text in 1965 (AMP). The New American Standard translation of the Gospel of John was published in 1963 and the complete Bible in 1971 (NASB). Substantial revisions to the Amplified version were issued in 1987 and 2015 and to the NASB version in 1995 and 2020. Both versions are offered in English and Spanish in various formats through the foundation's online store. In 2021 the Lockman Foundation partnered with 316 Publishing to produce the Legacy Standard Bible (LSB) designed to keep aspects of the 1995 version that were being changed in the 2020 version.
The foundation sought to have the NASB translated further into several Asian languages and maintained a relationship with an evangelical alliance mission for over 30 years. As a result, a Japanese version was published along with versions in Hindi, Korean, and Chinese (in both Mandarin and simplified scripts). The relationship eventually soured, and lawsuits were filed in the US and Japan over copyright and other issues. In 1991, a US Appeals Court decided the cases should be decided in Japanese courts.
As of 2022, the foundation's online store does not offer materials in Asian languages.

Asagiri-class destroyer

The is a class of destroyer, serving with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). It was the second class of first-generation general-purpose destroyers of the JMSDF.
Background.
The JMSDF started construction of a since FY1977. This was the first class of under the eight ships / eight helicopters concept. In this concept, each flotilla would be composed of one helicopter destroyer (DDH), five general-purpose destroyers (DD), and two guided-missile destroyers (DDG).
However, due to constraints such as budget, the design of the "Hatsuyuki" class was compelled to compromise in terms of C4I function, resistance, and durability. Thus, destroyers to be built after FY1983, "Asagiri" class were changed to an evolved design with expanded hull and enhanced equipment.
Design.
The hull is an enlarged type of "Hatsuyuki" class, and the hull form is of the shelter deck style. Also, as the latter batch of the "Hatsuyuki" class, the upper structure is made of steel, but since it was incorporated into the design from the beginning, the adverse effect on the movement performance was solved.
The engine room was greatly renovated. Instead of the COGOG propulsion system of the "Hatsuyuki" class, this class has the COGAG propulsion system with four Kawasaki-Rolls-Royce Spey SM1A gas turbines. With these powerful engines, it was possible to run at by driving only two of the four engines, and the benefits of tracking a submarine were especially great. An alternating arrangement was introduced to improve resistance and durability, as in the steam turbine driven destroyers.
Equipment.
The earlier batch was equipped with the OYQ-6 combat direction system (CDS). This system employed one AN/UYK-20 computer as the same as the OYQ-5 tactical data processing system of the "Hatsuyuki" class, but with expanded memories, it can exchange tactical data via Link-11, which the OYQ-5 does not support. Later, all OYQ-6 systems were upgraded to the OYQ-7, integrated with the OYQ-101 ASW Direction System. All ships of this class were later retrofitted with the terminal for the MOF system, the key operational C4I system of the JMSDF which uses the Superbird SHF-SATCOM.
The surface-search radars were replaced by OPS-28. The air-search radars were updated to OPS-14C in the earlier batch, and in the latter batch, OPS-24 3D radars were introduced. This was a maritime version of the land-based J/FPS-3 early-warning radar, and first shipboard active electronically scanned array radar in the world. In the latter batch, electronic warfare support measures systems were also replaced by NOLR-8, completely newly developed with emphasis on anti-ship missile defense.
Its weapon system is basically the same as the "Hatsuyuki" class except for the minor change on its FCS. However, a new SH-60J was installed as a shipboard helicopter, so a large capacity data link device was installed. The hangar is enlarged in order to accommodate two helicopters, but only one helicopter is used operationally.
Ships in the class.
"Yamagiri" and "Asagiri" were converted into training vessels for a few years.

R. Harold Zook

Roscoe Harold Zook (21 May 1889 – 17 April 1949) was an American architect best known for his work in suburban Chicago, Illinois. He received a degree in architecture from the Armour Institute of Technology (now Illinois Institute of Technology, or IIT) in 1914. In 1916, Zook married his first wife, Mildred Barnard. They divorced in the late 1930s. They had one son, Harold Barnard Zook, who followed in his father's footsteps to become an architect in Corona del Mar, California. In the early 1940s, Zook married his second wife, Florence (Barkey) Nissen, whom he met through mutual friends (and clients). Zook died in April 1949, just short of his 60th birthday.
Early life and career.
Roscoe Harold Zook was born in Valparaiso, Indiana on May 21, 1889, the sixth child of Florence and Dennis Coder Zook. His father was a builder, working as a master carpenter for the Pennsylvania Railroad in Fort Wayne. Zook's uncle, Jacob Steel Zook, was also a builder, most notably designing the Brumback Library in Van Wert, Ohio, now recognized as a Historic Place. 
R. Harold Zook spent most of his childhood in Fort Wayne, attending the public schools and showing an early proficiency for art. He attended college at the Armour Institute of Technology. After graduating in 1914, Zook was named to the faculty and taught for four years. He also taught interior design at the Art Institute of Chicago and apprenticed under Howard Van Doren Shaw. In the 1910s, Zook served as President of the Architects Club of Chicago, and was a member of several local architectural clubs. In 1922, Zook made an unsuccessful entry in the "Chicago Tribune" design competition for their new Chicago building.
Zook built a home and studio in Hinsdale in 1924. In 1925, Zook partnered with William F. McCaughey, a fellow apprentice of Shaw, to start a new architectural firm, operating out of the Auditorium Building. Later, he opened a new office on the 17th floor of the Marquette Building. He designed thirty-four homes and buildings in Hinsdale from 1922 to 1953. Twenty-eight houses in the neighborhood are still occupied. He also worked in Iowa, Wisconsin and Virginia.
He is known for the "Cotswold style cottages" he designed which use details from Tudor architecture including timber framing, exposed beams, diamond-shaped window panes, and intricate brick or stonework. He developed a roofing technique that came to be known as the "Zook roof", with wood shingles laid out in an undulating pattern across the surface to recreate the appearance of a thatched roof. The roofers used "rolled eaves" at the edges of the roof to make a curved transition into the wall below. Zook designed ornamental ironwork for several of these houses using a trademark spider web pattern. 
In partnership with architect William F. McCaughey, Zook designed the 1928 art deco style Pickwick Theatre in Park Ridge, Illinois. This was their only theater design, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The theater features a tower and lantern, a unique marquee and one of the original installations of a Mighty Wurlitzer theater organ.

<doc id="6900894" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6900894" title="Trochlea of superior oblique">
Trochlea of superior oblique

The trochlea of superior oblique is a pulley-like structure in the eye. The tendon of the superior oblique muscle passes through it. It is the only cartilage found in the normal orbit, on the superior nasal aspect of the frontal bone. The word "trochlea" comes from the Greek word for pulley.
Actions of the superior oblique muscle.
To understand the actions of the superior oblique muscle, it is helpful to imagine the eyeball as a sphere that is constrained – like the trackball of a computer mouse – in such a way that only specific rotational movements are possible. Allowable movements for the superior oblique are (1) rotation in a vertical plane – looking down and up ("depression" and "elevation" of the eyeball) and (2) rotation in the plane of the face ("intorsion" and "extorsion" of the eyeball).
The body of the superior oblique muscle is located "behind" the eyeball, but the tendon (redirected by the trochlea) approaches the eyeball from the "front". The tendon attaches to the top (superior aspect) of the eyeball at an angle of 51 degrees concerning the "primary position" of the eye (looking straight forward). Therefore, the force of the tendon’s pull has two components: a forward component that tends to pull the eyeball downward (depression) and a medial component that tends to rotate the top of the eyeball toward the nose (intorsion).
The relative strength of these two forces depends on how the eye is looking. When the eye is "adducted" (looking toward the nose), the force of depression increases. When the eye is "abducted" (looking away from the nose), the force of intorsion increases, while the force of depression decreases. When the eye is in the primary position (looking straight ahead), contraction of the superior oblique produces depression and intorsion in roughly equal amounts.
To summarize, the actions of the superior oblique muscle are (1) "depression" of the eyeball, especially when the eye is adducted; and (2) "intorsion" of the eyeball, especially when the eye is abducted. The clinical consequences of weakness in the superior oblique (caused, for example, by fourth nerve palsies) are discussed below.
This summary of the superior oblique muscle describes its most important functions. However, it is an oversimplification of the actual situation. For example, the tendon of the superior oblique inserts "behind" the equator of the eyeball in the frontal plane, so muscle contraction also tends to "abduct" the eyeball (turn it outward). In fact, each of the six extraocular muscles exerts rotational forces in "all three planes" (elevation-depression, adduction-abduction, intorsion-extorsion) to varying degrees, depending on which way the eye is looking. The relative forces change every time the eyeball moves – every time the direction of the gaze changes. The central control of this process, which involves the continuous, precise adjustment of forces on twelve different tendons to point both eyes in precisely the same direction, is truly remarkable.
The recent discovery of soft tissue pulleys in the orbit – similar to the trochlea, but anatomically more subtle and previously missed – has completely changed (and greatly simplified) our understanding of the actions of the extraocular muscles. Perhaps the most important finding is that a 2-dimensional visual field representation is sufficient for most purposes.

Citroën Bijou

The Citroën Bijou is a small coupé manufactured by Citroën at the premises they had occupied since 1925 in Slough, England, from 1959 until 1964. It was based on the same platform chassis as the Citroën 2CV, sharing its advanced independent front to rear interconnected suspension. The car's appearance was thought to be more in line with the conservative taste of British consumers than the utilitarian 2CV.
The body was made of fibreglass, and the car featured the two-cylinder 425 cc 12 bhp engine also seen in the 2CV. Only 210 were produced, plus two prototypes. It incorporated some components from the DS, most noticeably the single-spoke steering wheel.
It was designed by Peter Kirwan-Taylor, known as the stylist of the elegant 1957 Lotus Elite, another fibreglass-bodied car. Bijou bodies were initially moulded by a company called "Whitson &amp; Co", close to Citroën's Slough premises, but it later proved necessary to transfer this work to another supplier.
Disappointing sales levels for the UK's own Citroën seem to have been down to the Bijou's price, which at the time of the 1959 motor show was £674. At this time the British market was acutely price sensitive, and buyers could choose a Ford Popular with four seats and a much larger engine for £494.
The Bijou's more modern styling gave it a higher top speed and lower cruising fuel consumption than the equivalent 2CV; however, the greater weight of the bodywork had an adverse impact on the car's more general performance, especially its acceleration. The Bijou was considered expensive by the testers. It was also more expensive than the Austin Mini, but the Bijou was supposed to be more distinguished.
As of 2013, nearly 150 Bijous were on the 2CVGB club register, but fewer than 40 are still on the roads.

Elias David Häusser (25 June 1687 – 16 March 1745) was a German-Danish architect working in the Baroque and Rococo styles. He is most known for designing the first Christiansborg Palace which was almost completely destroyed in a fire in 1794. Häusser is credited with introducing both those styles to Denmark.
Biography.
Häusser was born in Erfurt, Prussia (Preußen).
His parents were David Häusser (1645-1709) and Johanna Maria Evander (1666-1741).
He spent some time at the court of the Duke of Saxe-Gotha and was educated as a military building master in Saxony-Poland. In 1711 he came into Danish military service. In the capacity of an officer in the engineering troops, he was in charge of several projects in Copenhagen, including the Central Guard on Kongens Nytorv and the Commander's House and prison at Kastellet.
In the early 1730s, King Christian VI commissioned him as master builder of a new grand castle, Christiansborg Palace, on the site of the old Copenhagen Castle, which had been torn down in 1731. He left the project in 1741, a few years before it was completed, to assume a position as Commander and later Major General in Nyborg on the Danish island of Funen. He died there in 1745.

Evacuation (TV series)

Evacuation is a British children's reality television series presented by Matt Baker which was broadcast on CBBC between September 2006 and February 2008 where six boys and six girls from across the United Kingdom experienced living as evacuees in World War II.
Format.
The children lived exactly as wartime evacuees would have: they ate meals, attended school, wore clothes, were given haircuts, and were punished for misbehavior as was customary during the 1940s. In the first episode of both series, the children had to hand over all of their 21st century items (e.g. mobile phones), which were returned at the end of the series. They were also given gas masks and ID cards, which were carried at all times. The children engaged in traditional wartime activities, such as building air-raid shelters. When they were not being filmed, the adults continued to stay in character to maintain the illusion that the scenario was real.
Series one.
The first series of "Evacuation" began transmission on CBBC on BBC One on 4 September 2006. The children were evacuated to the fictitious Castle Farm, where they experienced living as children who were evacuated to a traditional wartime farm.
Series two.
The second series, known as "Evacuation to the Manor House", began transmission on CBBC on BBC One on 17 January 2008. The children were evacuated to the fictitious Pradoe Hall, where they experienced living as children who were evacuated to a traditional 1940s manor house.

Juan Serrano (flamenco)

Dr. Juan Serrano Rodríguez is Spanish guitarist of flamenco who has played concerts and made recordings throughout the world. He has devoted much of his life to giving concerts and teaching flamenco guitar around the world.
Serrano was born in Córdoba, Spain in 1934 At the age of 9, he studied guitar with his father, Antonio el del Lunar, a professional guitarist. Serrano made his professional debut at age 13, and soon earned a reputation throughout Spain and Europe as a gifted musician. He performed and recorded with flamenco musical, dance, and theatrical companies. At this time Serrano also started his solo career. His home town of Córdoba was so proud of his accomplishments that they replaced the bell in the town clock with recordings of his guitar playing.
In 1961 Serrano accepted an invitation to come to America and perform on "The Ed Sullivan Show." The success of this performance led to numerous solo flamenco guitar concerts and more TV appearances, then a recording contract with Elektra Records, who released his US debut album "Ole, la mano!" in 1962. The "New York Times" said Serrano had "ten dexterous fingers that often sound like twenty... a breathtaking technician who can wring rhythmic dance fury out of fandangos and zapateados. He is a lyric sentamentalist, who can make the strings cry." Serrano made the US his home, where he achieved renown as an instructor. In Feb. 1968 he was the featured cover-photo artist for "Guitar Player" magazine.
Along with others such as Sabicas and Mario Escudero, Serrano's virtuosity helped establish solo flamenco guitar as a viable concert instrument beyond the borders of Spain.
He developed the guitar program at California State University, Fresno and headed the guitar department until his retirement. In addition to his teaching duties, Serrano is much sought after as a performer, for master classes and as a guest lecturer on the history of Flamenco. Serrano is the only flamenco guitarist in the world with a doctorate in humane letters and a tenured faculty position at a major university.
Córdoba also awarded Serrano the "Potro de Oro". This prestigious honor is awarded once every ten years; Serrano and Paco Peña are the only guitarists ever to be so honored. Serrano received the Page One Ball from the Newspaper Guild of New York for his outstanding performances. He was also awarded the Medalla de Oro from the Spanish Academy of Fine Arts, the Catedra de Flamencologia from Jerez, Spain, and an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut. The city of Fresno has bestowed on Serrano the "Fabulous Fresnan" and "Horizon" awards.
Juan Serrano currently lives in Longwood, Florida
Authored several guitar instruction books for Mel Bay Publications, including:
Awarded the Medalla de Oro from the Spanish Academy of Fine Arts, the Catedra de Flamencologia from Jerez de la Frontera, Spain.

Robertsite, Ca3(Mn3+)4[(OH)3| (PO4)2]2·3(H2O) (alternatively formulated Ca2(Mn3(PO4)3O2)(H2O)3), is a secondary phosphate mineral named for Willard Lincoln Roberts (1923–1987), mineralogist and professor at South Dakota School of Mines in Rapid City, South Dakota.
The type locality for Robertsite is the Tip Top mine, Custer County, South Dakota, US. Robertsite occurs at the Tip Top Mine as minute crystal aggregates and crusts found on quartz associated with triphylite. It is a dark reddish brown to black monoclinic mineral.
It occurs as a secondary mineral in pegmatite. It is also reported from the Khoa Rang Kai phosphate deposit, Chiang Mai, Thailand in a limestone guano deposit. It is associated with rockbridgeite, ferrisicklerite, leucophosphite, jahnsite, montgomeryite, collinsite and hureaulite in the type locality. In the guano deposit it occurs with carbonate-fluorapatite, calcite, dolomite, quartz and clay minerals. In the Omo Valley of Ethiopia it occurs with mitridatite associated with fossil fish in Pliocene/Pleistocene lake sediments.
Recently, in an exploration conducted by the Italian La Venta Geographical Association, confirmed the existence of Robertsite in the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) north of the city center of Puerto Princesa, Palawan, Philippines.

Yamagumo-class destroyer

The "Yamagumo" class are vessels of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force, usually classified as a destroyer, but due to their relatively light displacement, in other sources as a destroyer escort. This class is the successor of the .
This class was planned to become the new generation workhorse of the fleet of the JMSDF. In support of this objective, it was equipped with some new generation weapon and sensor systems such as the ASROC anti-submarine rocket and the OPS-11 early warning radar (Japanese equivalent of the American AN/SPS-40 radar).
The "Minegumo"-class destroyer derived from this class as the new DASH equipped version, but after the QH-50D DASH was scrapped, the JMSDF decided on resuming the construction of this class. The latter batch sometimes called as the "Aokumo" class, and there are some improvements, mainly in their electronics such as the OQS-3 hull-sonar (Japanese variant of the American AN/SQS-23) and the AN/SQS-35 variable depth sonar system.

Gathering of Israel

The Gathering of Israel (, ), or the Ingathering of the Jewish diaspora, is the biblical promise of , made by Moses to the Israelites prior to their entry into the Land of Israel.
During the days of the Babylonian captivity, writings by the Israelite prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel encouraged their people with the promise of a future gathering of the exiles to the Land of Israel. Since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, the continual hope for exiled Jews' return to the Land of Israel has served as a core theme of Judaism. Maimonides, a prominent medieval Jewish scholar, connected the materialization of this return with the coming of the Davidic Messiah.
This gathering of the Jewish diaspora became the foundation of the Zionist ideology and later the central theme of the Israeli Declaration of Independence. It defines "aliyah", the act of diaspora Jews migrating to Israel, since Israel is considered to be spiritually higher for the Jewish people than any other of the world's lands. Since 1948, the mass migration of diaspora Jews to Israel has been likened to The Exodus from ancient Egypt, especially in the context of the Jewish exodus from Muslim-majority countries.
Moses' promise.
In the latter parts of the Book of Deuteronomy, when Moses' death was near, he prophesied about the destiny of the people of Israel. Their destiny would not be promising – curses would come upon them and they would go into exile – but when they return to their homeland later, their situation will be as good as it had been in the past, and so said Moses:
Prophets' promise.
The Nevi'im (Prophets) prophesying after the destruction of the First Temple had encouraged the Babylonian exiles by reiterating the words of Moses.
In chapter 11 the Book of Isaiah says (the gathering here is mentioned as being done for the "second time". What this means remains cryptic:
In chapter 29 the Book of Jeremiah says:
In chapter 20 the Book of Ezekiel says:
Maimonides.
In Law of Kings, Maimonides writes:
Other Jewish scholars.
Other Jewish scholars view this differently from Maimonides. They argue that the Torah attested to a period, not a person, the period in which the People of Israel return to their homeland, the land of Israel. The act of ingathering of the exiles of Israel in the land of Israel, a "Kibbutz Galuyot", will bring about the coming of the messiah, as the hand of God is in the events of the creation of the State of Israel, obviously a different reality then Maimonides depicts, though they see the writings of Maimonides as a way of learning the importance of the role of the messiah, since the Maimonides was a scholar not a prophet, and did not live up to see the event of the establishment of the State of Israel.
Zvi Yehuda Kook, one of the leaders of the Religious Zionist Movement, used to quote from the Responsa book, "Yeshuot Malko", of Israel Yehosha of kutna, in conjunction with Aliyah (10:66): "There is no doubt that this is a greater Mitzvah (a commandment of the Torah), because the gathering is an " Atchalta De'Geulah " ('the beginning of the redemption'), as attested, "I will yet gather others to him, together with his gathered ones" (Isaiah, 56:8), and see "Yebamoth", page 64, "the Divine Presence does not rest on less than two myriads of Israelites", especially nowadays in which we have seen the great desire inasmuch as in men of lesser importance, mediocre ones, and upright in heart, it is more than likely that we would gleam with the spirit of salvation, fortunate are the "ones who" take part in "bringing merit unto the masses"
Haredi Judaism and Chabad movement takes the writings of the Maimonides literally: The messiah is assigned the mission of completing the ingathering the exiles of Israel. Until then, the Jewish community living in Israel is defined as a Diaspora of Israel, though they give their consent to the Jewish rule of Israel, and see the advantages of it.
Terms of Jewish nationality.
1. "Cyrus's Declaration" (538 BC), Ezra 1:3
2. Napoleon, in his Proclamation to the Jews of Asia and Africa (1799), called for the return of the Jewish people:
The French scholar Henry Laurens holds that the proclamation never took place and that the document supposedly proving its existence is a forgery.
3. Balfour Declaration:
Zionism.
The First Zionist Congress of the World Zionist Organization (WZO), assembled in Basel in August 1897 and adopted the Zionist platform, which came to be known as the Basel Program, which stipulated the following goal: "Zionism seeks to establish a homeland for the Jewish people in Eretz Israel secured by public law".
Aliyah.
"Aliyah Bet" was the code name given to illegal immigration by Jews to Mandatory Palestine between 1920 and 1948, in violation of the restrictions laid out in the British White Paper of 1939, which dramatically increased between 1939 and 1948. "Aliyah Bet" was organized by the Yishuv (the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel before Israel's establishment as a country) from 1934 until the State of Israel began in 1948.
"Aliyah Bet" was carried out by the Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, a branch of the Jewish Defense Association (Haganah), the paramilitary organization that was to become the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). During "Aliyah Bet's" 14 years of activity, 115,000 Jews made "Aliyah" to the Land of Israel. The British Mandate for Palestine attempted to limit the number of immigration certificates in a way which contradicted the national goals of the Jewish community living there. "Aliyah Bet" started only modestly in the midst of the nineteen-thirties.
The State of Israel.
The idea of the ingathering of the exiles of Israel in the land of Israel (a "Kibbutz Galuyot") was the basis for the establishment of the State of Israel, being mentioned in the Israeli Declaration of Independence. After the Holocaust, the United Nations General Assembly, in its decision-making process on United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, perceived this idea to be the reason for adopting the decision on a Jewish State. Expressions of yearning for the gathering of the exiles of Israel in the land of Israel can be found in the Prayer for the State of Israel, which was authored by Israel's Chief Rabbis during the first years of Israel's existence. Israel's bodies of authorities have expressed their opinion on this matter by passing the Law of Return, which granted every Jew the right to make "Aliyah" to the land of Israel.
Prayer for the State of Israel.
The Prayer for the Welfare of the State of Israel is recited on the Sabbath and Jewish holidays in many synagogues around the world. The prayer appeals to God to bless the land of Israel, to assist its leaders, and an appeal using the words of Moses:
 The prayer is commonly recited in Religious Zionist and Conservative Judaism synagogues, but generally not in Haredi synagogues.
Law of Return.
The "Law of Return" (Hebrew: חוק השבות, "Hok ha-shvut"), a law passed in 1950 in memory of the Holocaust, allows every Jew the right to make "Aliyah" to the State of Israel and to receive a certificate of "Aliyah", which grants the certificate holder an Israeli Citizenship immediately. This stems from Israel's identity as the Jewish State, which is connected to the idea of the gathering of Israel.
Yom HaAliyah.
"Yom HaAliyah" ("Aliyah Day") () is a new Israeli national holiday officially passed into law on June 21, 2016. Yom HaAliyah is to be celebrated annually on the tenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan (). The day was established to acknowledge Aliyah, immigration to the Jewish state, as a core value of the State of Israel, and honor the ongoing contributions of Olim to Israeli society.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe in the literal gathering of Israel: That all of the lost tribes will be returned and gathered together around the time of the second coming of Jesus Christ.
Members of the church receive patriarchal blessings in which their lineage is declared. They are declared as being a descendent (literal or adopted) of one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Many members of the church today are a part of the tribe of Ephraim, a fulfillment of prophecy that Ephraim would have the birthright and responsibility for helping to gather scattered Israel in the last days.

Gae Aulenti

Gaetana "Gae" Emilia Aulenti (; 4 December 1927 – 31 October 2012) was an Italian architect and designer. Aulenti began her career in the early 1950s, establishing herself as one of the few prominent female architects in post-war Italy. 
Although modernism was the predominant international architectural style throughout much of the 20th century, Aulenti stepped away from its tenets to embrace neo-liberty, an architectural and design theory which upheld the relevance of tradition and artistic freedom within the modern aesthetic.
Throughout her career, Aulenti applied her architecture and design expertise to a diverse range of fields, from furniture design to large-scale architectural projects. 
Aulenti is widely acknowledged for transforming the Gare d'Orsay to the Musée d'Orsay. She was awarded the "Chevalier de la Legion d' Honneur" and the "Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana".
Personal life and education.
Aulenti was born in Palazzolo dello Stella in the Friuli region of northeast Italy to Aldo Aulenti, an accountant and his wife, Virginia Gioia, a school teacher. The Aulenti family, with ancestral origins in Calabria, Apulia and Campania, included her paternal grandfather, who served as a magistrate, and her maternal grandfather, who was a physician.
When Aulenti was a child, her family moved to Biella, in the Piedmont region in northern Italy. Aulenti attended a visual arts high-school in Florence; however, during World War II, she was compelled to return to Biella where she continued her studies privately. Reflecting on her life, Aulenti remarked that she was acquainted with several partisans in Piedmont, who placed their trust in her. She would carry out small missions for the Allies while pretending to be on a leisurely outing to the countryside. 
Although Aulenti initially studied visual arts, she saw an opportunity to contribute to the rebuilding of Italy and in 1948 she enrolled in the architectural program at the Polytechnic University of Milan. Other alumni from Aulenti's generation at the Polytechnic included Anna Castelli Ferrieri, Franca Stagi and Cini Boeri. 
Milan was attractive to students, like Aulenti, because it had been an open city during World War II and was rich with culture and intellectual life. Among Milanese cultural figures of that time, Aulenti recalled the film-maker, Luchino Visconti and the author, Elio Vittorini (whom she met) but also international figures such as Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. 
Aulenti married fellow Polytechnic alumnus Francesco Buzzi in 1959. They had a daughter, Giovanna Buzzi but divorced three years later. Giovanna was close to her mother and saw her as a mentor. Aulenti's granddaughter also became an architect.
Architectural and design philosophy.
Approximately one third of Milan's built structures were destroyed in the hostilities of World War II. The post-war reconstruction of Milan (part of the Italian economic miracle) involved large architectural and urban design projects. Architects faced the problem of reconstructing a city of renowned historical and cultural city edifices in a way that acknowledged modern architectural materials, techniques and style. It was in this setting that Aulenti began her career.
Aulenti said,I am convinced that architecture is tied to the polis, it is an art of the city, of the foundation, and as such it is necessarily related and conditioned by the context in which it is born. Place, time, and culture create that architecture, instead of another.From 1955 to 1965, Aulenti was a graphic designer at Casabella-continuità, a Milanese magazine focussed on avant-garde architecture and design. Working under editor-in-chief Ernesto Nathan Rogers, Aulenti examined neo-liberty, a novel Italian architectural theory. Neo-liberty posited that there is a continuity between historical and modern architectural styles rather than an end of one and the beginning of another and that elements from the past can be used to enhance contemporary design. This is counter to modernism which eschews ornamentation and places function before form. Aulenti explained,The architecture in which I would like to recognize myself derives from three fundamental capacities of an aesthetic and not a moral order. The first is the analytical one, in the sense that we must be able to recognize the continuity of both conceptual and physical urban and geographical traces, as specific essences of architecture. The second is the synthetic one, that is to know how to operate the necessary synthesis in order to render priority and evident the principles of the architecture. The third is the prophetic one, typical of artists, poets and inventors.Aulenti's interpretation of neo-liberty is exemplified in her first furniture piece, the Sgarsul chair (1962), crafted from bent beech wood with a slung leather seat containing soft polyurethane padding. The design of the Sgarsul chair draws inspiration from Michael Thonet's Rocking Chair No. 1 (1862). In her later life, Aulenti said of her work,I have always tried to make my work unclassifiable, not to accept abstract rules, not to confine myself to specializations, but instead to deal with different disciplines. The theatre, for example, to be able to analyze literary and musical texts. The design of objects as a complementary world to architectural spaces. Architecture as a basic passion where theory and practice must intertwine. I believe architecture is an interdisciplinary intellectual work, a work in which building science and art are extremely integrated.
Career.
Industrial design.
Aulenti had a prolific career in industrial design.
Her Locus Solus furniture collection, introduced in 1964, was inspired by the country estate featured in Raymond Roussel's 1912 novel of the same name. The collection comprised chairs, a table, an adjustable lamp, a sofa, a sun lounger, and a bench, all manufactured from tubular cold-formed steel by the Poltronova furniture company. The Locus Solus collection was used as set decoration in the film, La Piscine (1969). In 2023, a replica collection in off-white and yellow was produced for commercial sale.
Lamps designed by Aulenti were notable for their style, innovation and function. For example, the Giova lamp (1964) designed for Fontana Arte, a lighting and furniture manufacturer, was a centripetal object that functioned as a lamp, a planter, an aroma diffuser and an objet d'art. The Pipistrello lamp (1965) was another of Aulenti's early yet enduring designs. The lamp featured a neck that could extend by 20 cm, allowing it to be positioned on either a table or the floor. It was manufactured by Elio Martinelli, the founder of the Martinelli Luce lighting company, using poly(methyl acrylate) molding. The Ruspa table lamp (1967) was a modular group of four lights. Direct light and indirect light from imbedded reflectors was controlled by angling of lamp's head. The Ruspa was unconventional as it was crafted in lacquered aluminium instead of plastic.
Olivetti, the maker of precision office machines, engaged Aulenti to design their showrooms in Paris (1967) and Buenos Aires (1968). Office machines, such as typewriters, were displayed on structures of white laminate steps accented by radiating spokes of dark polished wood. This design drew inspiration from the steps of a piazza and the repeating triangular patterns found in traditional African arts and crafts. In the centre of the display, a tall red structure, resembling a space capsule, represented the future. Lighting was provided by Aulenti's Girasole floor lamp in which nine semicircles of clear plastic were set around a central spine and a concealed light bulb. Aulenti describes her work for Olivetti as the pivotal starting point of her international career. 
In 1968, Aulenti designed showrooms in Turin, Zurich and Brussels for the car manufacturer, Fiat. The cars were showcased single file, each on an inclined metal platform set against mirrored walls. The customer explored a central viewing point, while the cars were arranged, as though driving on a race track, around them. Furniture for the show room was produced from Aulenti's designs by the Kartell furniture company. At the time, Kartell was experimenting with injection moulding. 
Aulenti collaborated with the French fashion house Louis Vuitton to design a watch accompanied by a matching pen and silk scarf. The design, known as the "Monterey" (1988) was released in two versions. The Monterey I featured elements reminiscent of an elaborately decorated pocket watch while the Monterey II stood out with its sleek black polished ceramic case. 
Aulenti also designed a line of porcelain sanitary ware, which she called, the "Orsay" collection (1996).
Architectural design.
Musée d'Orsay.
The "Gare d'Orsay" (Orsay railway station) was built on left bank of the Seine in 1900 to a plan by Victor Laloux. The Beaux-Arts style terminus station and the connected hotel served passengers travelling from southwest France to the capital. 
In 1975, the French president, François Mitterrand, asked the French architectural firm, ACT to commence an adaptive reuse project to convert the Gare d'Orsay into a new museum, the Musée d'Orsay.
Initially, Aulenti was assigned solely to the interior design of the new museum. However, due to disagreements between ACT and the curators, her role expanded to encompass the overall architectural planning of the project. Aulenti successfully advocated for changes to the ACT design, which the curators believed was overly tied to neo-classical aesthetics and excessively ornate. In the final plan, however, some features of the Gare d'Orsay were preserved, including the mansard roof, an ornate art nouveau clock, large busts of Mercury and the rose patterned tiles covering the ceiling.
Aulenti divided the station into three levels. On the ground floor, the main corridor was re-aligned to the long axis of the building and set on a gentle slope to form a sculpture garden. Limestone tiles, in various shades of white, were attached to the surfaces of the ramp, platforms on the ramp and, at one end of the corridor, two new towers. The old art nouveau clock is balanced by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux's sculpture, "The Four Parts of the World Supporting the Celestial Sphere."
Balconies overlooking the main corridor (usually called the "nave") were added to the mezzanine and upper level (attic). Natural light enters the building from the original large, glass, barrel-vault ceiling, windows facing the Rue de Lille and from new oculi. By adding artificial lighting, Aulenti was able to achieve a uniform quality of illumination throughout the museum. 
Mitterrand inaugurated the Musée d'Orsay on 1 December 1986. The museum's interior design has since been updated to feature halogen lighting, dark wood floors, and grey walls.
Charles Jencks, cultural theorist and architectural historian, described the Musée d'Orsay as an example of a "postmodern museum", where there is tension due to the past needing to exist in the present and the artistic in the academic. Jencks said, "The train shed, a symbol of nineteenth-century power and materialism, meets a thirteenth-century cathedral layout in a twentieth-century temple to the contradictions of nineteenth-century art."
He wrote of the museum,The linear, suiting trains, also suits historical sequence with startling results. They give a clear beginning, middle and end to the gentle stroll through history. Overhead, the wide barrel vault of the old station spreads a generous light that pulls one gently up the progression of French art. The floor and the visitor mount slowly, too ... Gae Aulenti has articulated the walls to either side of this nave space in heavy Egyptian tones, but also with horizontal streamlines that push forward ... thus, the railway station becomes a cathedral with the left aisle housing the avant-garde and the right aisle holding the academy. Up the middle, the nave mixes the two competitors but not indiscriminately.The new museum opened to the public on 9 December 1986 to mixed review. Paul Goldberger, architectural critic, wrote in The New York Times,Unfortunately, the results of this ambitious project are, architecturally speaking, not natural at all. They are contrived, awkward and uncomfortable. The newly created Musée d'Orsay may be the most ambitious conversion of an old building into a museum in the modern history of Paris, but it is also a work of architecture that is deeply insensitive both to the original Gare d'Orsay and to the works of art it is supposed to be protecting and displaying. It will do little to advance the art of museum design, and it may well set the business of architectural "recycling" back a generation.Aulenti received the Chevalier de Légion d'honneur in 1987.
Centre Georges Pompidou.
The Centre Pompidou, the home of the "Musée National d'Art Moderne", was built between 1972 and 1977 to a plan by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers. The ten-level building, constructed in glass and metal, was designed with expansive indoor spaces to provide flexibility in its use. 
Aulenti was engaged to redesign the portion of the Musée occupying the fourth floor of the center, to create modular spaces better suited for smaller exhibitions, and to reduce the amount of natural light impacting the artworks. Aulenti created galleries of varying sizes along a building-length, unobstructed corridor-gallery set beside the west windows. She installed shelves, alcoves and pedestals within the galleries and created small corridors linking the galleries for fragile items that required low light.
The Musée itself owns a number of pieces from Aulenti's design career, from her 1964 "April" stainless steel and brown leather folding chair to its 2008 redesign in bright yellow "toile vela" (outdoor fabric).
Palazzo Grassi.
The Palazzo Grassi is an 18th-century mansion on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy. In 1983, when the Palazzo was owned by the Fiat group, Aulenti was commissioned to refurbish the building as an art exhibition space. The Palazzo was gutted and refurbished over a thirteen-month period, reopening on 15 April 1985. 
The existing three-level building was dark and labyrinthine, making its original features difficult to distinguish. Aulenti examined contemporary Venetian buildings for elements associated with the Palazzo's original architect, Giorgio Massari. Having repaired the original masonry with salvaged 19th century bricks, Aulenti fixed new utilities in a way that would leave the restored masonry undisturbed, even in future renovations. Paint was applied in a palette of aquamarine on pink marble-patterned stucco ("marmorino"). 
Aulenti and Piero Castiglioni, an Italian lighting designer, created the Castello Lighting System for the Palazzo. The Castello system, designed for flexibility, was manufactured in aluminium with low voltage halogen bulbs. It won a Compasso d'Oro design award in 1995.
In the following years, Aulenti returned a number of times to the Palazzo Grassi to design popular exhibitions. "I Fenici" (1988)"," "I Celti" (1991) and "I Greci in Occidente" (1996) were all months long archeological expositions designed for the non-scholar. In creating "I Fenici" (The Phoenicians) with Sabatino Moscati, archeologist and curator of the exhibition, Aulenti created a path for visitors with two distinct educational threads; first, a traditional display of archaeological objects categorized by typology and geography and second, an exploration of Phoenician culture. The exhibit embodied Aulenti's aptitude for stage design, featuring a salmon-pink sand dune as a set for eight sarcophagi and a large pool for model ships. Additionally, Aulenti presented information in graffiti and murals.
Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.
The "Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya" at the Palau Nacional, Barcelona, home of the Catalan visual arts collection, was constructed on Montjuïc for the 1929 World's Fair. As part of a design team including Enric Steegman and Josep Benedito, between 1985 and 1992, Aulenti refurbished the Saló Oval (the main hall) and consolidated two temporary exhibition rooms for the 1992 Summer Olympics. Glass was added to the outer walls of the Saló Oval for better illumination and once again, Castiglioni created the artificial lighting plan.
Japan.
Aulenti designed the chancellery of the Italian Embassy (2004) and the Italian Cultural Institute (2005) in Tokyo. At the Italian Cultural Institute, Aulenti used an RAL 3011 coloured cladding, a red-brown hue which was controversial due to the perceived intensity of the colour. On the ten year anniversary of Aulenti's death, the Italian Cultural Institute in Tokyo presented an exhibition of her drawings, photographs, models and materials called "Uno sguardo sul Giappone e sul mondo (A look at Japan and the world)." 
Other selected architectural design projects.
Aulenti's other projects included the conversion of Scuderie del Quirinale, Quirinal Palace, Rome to an exhibition space for the 2000 Great Jubilee, the redesigning of the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco (2003), the restoration of the "Palazzo Branciforte" in Palermo, Sicily (2007) and the expansion of the "Perugia San Francesco d'Assisi" (Umbria International Airport) for the 150th anniversary of the unification of Italy (2011). In 1991, Aulenti converted a 17th-century granary at the Torrecchia Vecchia estate in Lazio to a villa for Carlo Caracciolo. Aulenti designed the Italian Pavilion at the Seville Expo '92 and the redevelopment of the Piazzale Cadorna (2000) in Milan. The Città degli Studi College (1994), at Briella was one of Aulenti's few stand-alone architectural projects.
Stage design.
Aulenti and Luca Ronconi, theatre director and producer, founded "Laboratorio di Progettazione Teatrale" (the Prato Theatre design workshop) in the late 1970s. Together, they staged 16 productions including, Pier Paolo Pasolini's "Calderón", Euripide's "Le Baccanti," and Hugo von Hofmannsthall's "La Torre". 
In her stage design, Aulenti looked to Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's work, "A Manifesto of Variety Theatre" (1913)"." Marinetti rejected imitation of the historic and the obsessive reproduction of daily life. Rather, he chose freedom in design, the use of a cinematic background, and imaginative, satiric and futuristic concepts. Aulenti did not rely on scenery canvas and flats to provide perspective. Instead, she divided the stage with structures, such as platforms and steps, in order to give context to the action. 
At La Scala in 1977, Aulenti created the stage design for "Wozzeck", the atonal opera by Alban Berg. Claudio Abbado was the conductor with Gloria Lane and Guglielmo Sarabia the principals. Aulenti's daughter, Giovanna Buzzi, designed the costumes. 
The French music critic, Jacques Lonchampt reviewed the production in Le Monde. He described the stage as being enclosed by a large "crushing" wall and prison gate, and the stage itself, a "conveyor belt", starting and stopping but inexorably carrying the characters towards the prison. 
Lonchampt wrote, This device has the major drawback of raising the stage quite considerably and of distancing the singers from the room. The sound is lost in the flies and in the first rows, at least, the voices seem thin, without force or resonance ... unreal ... which is serious in a work with such brief tableaux, where the listener must feel the physical presence of the characters from the outset. The Italian musicologist, Massimo Mila, reviewed this production in La Stampa. He described a construction of moving boards which changed colour with different lights. The moving mechanism brought props such as a chair and table or roughly arranged blankets and mattresses to the scene. Mila thought the stage design was effective until the noise of some unintended movements of the device interrupted the performance. 
Nicholas Vitaliano, Ronconi's biographer, wrote that Aulenti and Ronconi wanted to designed a "stage machine", a moving surface traversing the entire stage, which was otherwise left in almost entire darkness. 
Aulenti's stage design for Ronconi's production of Rossini's opera, "Il viaggio a Reims" ("Journey to Reims)" at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro (1984) involved on-stage television monitors. From their position on the stage, video operators filmed the performance and in real time, broadcast the recordings, such as close-ups of the singers, onto the monitors. In addition, actors (playing the king and his retinue) were filmed processing on the streets outside the theatre. Television monitors around the city broadcast the action inside the theatre while the monitors in the theatre played the action on the streets. Italian critics praised this staging but critics from the United Kingdom and the United States did not.
The premier of "Samstag aus Licht" by Karlheinz Stockhausen was produced by Ronconi for La Scala (1984). La Scala was too small for the expected audience and so the production was moved to the Palazzo dello sport (the Milan sports centre). In the stadium space, Aulenti and Ronconi created a spectacle. In the act, "Lucifer's dance", the "spirit of negation" appeared on stilts in front of a very large human face. The character on stilts controlled the face through the music of a wind band that was seated on a vertical frame on the stage.
Aulenti also created the stage designs for Elektra by Richard Strauss in Milan (1984) and "The Wild Duck" by Henrik Ibsen in Genoa. 
Exhibition design.
Aulenti designed exhibition spaces both in Italy and abroad. 
At the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in New York City, Aulenti designed the exhibition space for "The Italian Metamorphosis 1943–1968" (1994), an exhibition of post-war art and design curated by Germano Celant. Aulenti created a large sculpture of wire triangles which projected into the museum's atrium. The visitors' perspective on the sculpture gradually changed as they moved up the ramp. Benjamin Buchloh commented that designers, such as Aulenti, are able to highlight their own "trademark" architectural aesthetic by incorporating it into their exhibition design. He was critical, suggesting that this is to the detriment of the artistic work or object being displayed. Buchloch described Aulenti's "zig-zag" design, when placed in the curved space of the Guggenheim, as a "vagina dentata".
Milan Triennial.
Aulenti had an association with the Milan Triennial over many years. She presented her own work, "Ideal apartment for an urban location" at the "La casa e la scuola" exhibition at the 12th Triennial in 1960.
Then, in 1964, she won the Grand International Prize for "Arrivo al Mare" (Arrival at the seaside). In this work, Aulenti installed a large mirrored room with multiple, life-sized, colour-sketched cut-outs of women in simple robes, standing under a ceiling of slung fabric strips. It was inspired by Pablo Picasso. 
Aulenti was a member of the executive of the Triennial from 1977 to 1980. She designed spaces for installations at exhibitions such as the "1951–2001 Made in Italy?" (2001).
Professional affiliations.
From 1955 to 1965, Aulenti was a member of the editorial staff of the design magazine, "Casabella Continuità". Aulenti wrote two articles for Casabella: "Soviet architecture" (1962) and "Marin County" (1964). From 1954 to 1962, Aulenti was a member of the editorial staff of "Lotus international", the quarterly Milanese architecture magazine.
As an educator, Aulenti was an assistant professor of architectural composition (1960–1962) at Ca' Foscari University of Venice, adjunct assistant professor of elements of architectural composition (1964) at Milan Polytechnic, and visiting lecturer at the College of Architecture, Barcelona and the Stockholm Cultural Centre (1969–1975). She also taught at the Milan School of Architecture (1964–1967).
Aulenti was a member of Movimento Studi per I'Architettura, Milan (1955–1961) and the Association for Industrial Design, Milan (1960 and vice-president in 1966).
Death and legacy.
On 31 October 2012, Aulenti died at her home in the Brera district of Milan as a result of chronic illness. This was fifteen days, after her last public appearance when she received the gold medal for Lifetime Achievement at the Milan Triennial. At noon on 4 November 2012, a remembrance service was held at the Ridotto dei Palchi hall at La Scala. 
Ten days after her death, Aulenti's major work to expand the Perugia San Francesco d'Assisi – Umbria International Airport was inaugurated. It was designed for the 150th anniversary of the unification of Italy.
In December 2012, the Piazza Gae Aulenti was dedicated to Aulenti's memory. It is a contemporary public space surrounded by private enterprises in the Isola neighbourhood near the Porta Garibaldi railway station. The piazza is 100 meters in diameter and is constructed 6 meters above ground level. There are three large fountains with a boardwalk extending to the centre of the piazza.
After Aulenti's death, the Milan Triennial and Archivio Gae Aulenti created an exhibition remembering her life and work. It is a sequence of rooms recreating, true to size, several of her interior design projects, including the "Arrivo al Mar"e room. At the centre of the exhibition is a display of Aulenti's industrial design works and around the perimeter, a display of Aulenti's papers.
From 2020 to 2021, the Vitra Design Museum, a private museum in Germany, presented the exhibition, "Gae Aulenti: A Creative Universe".
For the tenth anniversary of Aulenti's death, Open House – Milan and the Aulenti estate created an exhibition highlighting Aulenti's contribution to architecture, choosing one project from each of the Open House Italia network cities: Milan (Piazza Cadorna), Naples (Piazza Dante), Rome (Scuderie del Quirinale) and Turin (Palavela). 
A selection of Aulenti's papers, drawings, and designs, including the design drawings for the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, California are curated at the International Archive of Women in Architecture in the Newman Library, at Virginia Tech. Drawings, photographic material and design models under plexiglass by Aulenti are held by Sistema Informativo Unificato per le Soprintendenze Archivistiche (SIUSA). Aulenti's granddaughter, Nina Artioli is the curator of Aulenti's archive in Milan.
Architects, Marco Bifoni, Francesca Fenaroli and Vittoria Massa continue under Aulenti's name as G.A. Architetti Associati.

Beat Generation (play)

Beat Generation is a play written by Jack Kerouac upon returning home to Florida after his seminal work "On the Road" had been published in 1957. Gerald Nicosia, a Kerouac biographer and family friend has said that theatre producer Leo Gavin suggested that Kerouac should write a play; the outcome being "Beat Generation".
It was rejected by theatre companies and was shelved in warehouse storage until being rediscovered in a New Jersey warehouse in 2005.
A part of "Beat Generation" went on to provide the script for the 1959 film "Pull My Daisy", which starred Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky, Gregory Corso, Larry Rivers, Alice Neel, David Amram, Richard Bellamy and Delphine Seyrig. It was named after the poem "Pull My Daisy" by Kerouac, Ginsberg and Neal Cassady. Kerouac provided improvised narration to the film.
Since then excerpts have appeared in "Best Life Magazine" (July 2005), and the play has been published by Thunders Mouth Press. "Beat Generation" received its world premiere as part of the 2012 Jack Kerouac Literary Festival from October 10–14 in Kerouac's hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts. It was announced the play would be presented in a staged reading format by Merrimack Repertory Theatre and the University of Massachusetts Lowell.

Night Train (Jimmy Forrest composition)

"Night Train" is a twelve-bar blues instrumental standard first recorded by Jimmy Forrest in 1951.
Origins and development.
"Night Train" has a long and complicated history. The piece's opening riff was first recorded in 1940 by a small group led by Duke Ellington sideman Johnny Hodges, under the title "That's the Blues, Old Man". 
Ellington used the same riff as the opening and closing theme of a longer-form composition, "Happy-Go-Lucky Local", that was itself one of four parts of his 1946 "Deep South Suite". Jimmy Forrest was part of Ellington's band when it performed this composition, which has a long tenor saxophone break in the middle. After leaving Ellington, Forrest recorded "Night Train" on United Records, and his record was the fifth best selling R&amp;B record of 1952. While "Night Train" employs the same riff as the earlier recordings, Forrest's record used a rhythm and blues arrangement, and included a stop-time tenor sax break not used in the Hodges or Ellington arrangements.
Solo importance.
Forrest's saxophone solo on the 1951 "Night Train" recording became a part of the performance tradition of the song, and is usually recreated in cover versions by other performers. Trombonist Buddy Morrow, for example, played Forrest's solo on trombone on a 1953 recording of the song that became a hit in Great Britain and reached #12 on the UK singles chart.
Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) credits the composition to Jimmy Forrest and Oscar Washington.
Lyrics.
Several different sets of lyrics have been set to the tune of "Night Train". The earliest, written in 1952, are credited to Lewis P. Simpkins, the co-owner of United Records, and guitarist Oscar Washington. They are a typical blues lament by man who regrets treating his woman badly now that she has left him. Douglas Wolk, who describes the original lyrics as "fairly awful", suggests that Simpkins co-wrote (or had Washington write) them as a deliberate throwaway, in order to get part of the tune's songwriting credit; this entitled him to substantial share of "Night Train"'s royalties, even though it was most often performed as an instrumental without the lyrics.
Eddie Jefferson recorded a version of "Night Train" with more optimistic lyrics, about a woman returning to her man on the night train.
James Brown version.
James Brown recorded "Night Train" with his band the Famous Flames in 1961. His performance replaced the original lyrics of the song with a shouted list of cities on his East Coast touring itinerary (and hosts to black radio stations he hoped would play his music) along with many repetitions of the song's name. (Brown would repeat this lyrical formula on "Mashed Potatoes U.S.A." and several other recordings.) He also played drums on the recording. Originally appearing as a track on the album "James Brown Presents His Band and Five Other Great Artists", it received a single release in 1962 and became a hit, charting #5 R&amp;B and #35 Pop.
A live version of the tune was the closing number on Brown's 1963 album "Live at the Apollo". Brown also performs "Night Train" along with his singing group the Famous Flames (Bobby Byrd, Bobby Bennett, and Lloyd Stallworth) on the 1964 motion picture/concert film "The T.A.M.I. Show".
Brown's backing band the J.B.'s would later incorporate the main saxophone line of "Night Train" in their instrumental single, "All Aboard The Soul Funky Train", released on the 1975 album "Hustle with Speed".

Tampa Union Station

Tampa Union Station is an Amtrak train station in Tampa, Florida. The station is located at 601 North Nebraska Avenue (SR 45). Built in 1912, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 as Union Railroad Station The station building was closed in 1984 and reopened in 1998 after restoration. The station is served by the daily .
Design.
The station was originally built with eight tracks, although only one is in regular use today (designated as "Track 3"), with adjacent Track 2 also available for use by trains as needed. Amtrak added a new, high-level platform and canopy to Track 3 to improve accessibility, which opened in November 2020. The construction of the new platform resulted in changes to track configurations at the station. Tracks 4, 5, and 6 were removed to facilitate the construction of the high-level platform, although there are plans to restore them in the future if demand warrants. Although some of the other tracks remain in place, they are out of service. Original track bumpers, constructed of poured concrete, are still located at the ends of several of the remaining tracks and at the ends of former tracks. Adjacent to each of these bumpers are concrete planters which have "TUS" cast into them.
Union Station consists of the main building which includes the waiting room, as well as an attached restaurant and baggage building. A detached express building located adjacent to the baggage building handled packages and freight transfers from trains to trucks (all structures remain on site with the exception of the express building, which was demolished in the 1970s).
At its opening, Union Station's waiting room was segregated (during the Jim Crow era, a wall across the center of the waiting room divided "white" and "colored" passengers, with separate entrances for each). Segregation remained a common practice in railroad stations in the South until it was stricken down by the Interstate Commerce Commission as a result of "NAACP v. St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company" in 1955. However, like many train stations in the South, Tampa Union Station remained segregated to an extent even after the Interstate Commerce Commission's order. Passengers of intrastate trains were still bound by Jim Crow laws. During January 1956, the "Tampa Times" photographed signage at Union Station wherein the word "Intrastate" had been added beneath the old signage above the entrance to the so-called "colored" side of the waiting room. Full desegregation would not come until later. In fact, the Florida statute providing for segregation on railroads remained a law on the books as late as 1967, although by then the practice had fallen into disuse.
A train wash and car repair facility are also on the property. Both of these elements were added by Amtrak in the 1980s when Amtrak formerly maintained a Tampa maintenance base. However, both are largely unused today.
The City of Tampa's Real Estate Division manages Tampa Union Station for the city. The Division has leased portions of the facility to private tenants, including a second floor office once occupied by the Pullman Company. Part of the former baggage building — which once housed the station's restaurant — is leased to a local real estate firm. Another portion of the baggage building (including the baggage storage and scale area) was leased to art gallery Flight 19 from 2004 to 2008.
History.
It was designed by Joseph F. Leitner and was opened on May 15, 1912, by the Tampa Union Station Company. Its original purpose was to combine passenger operations for the Atlantic Coast Line, the Seaboard Air Line and the Tampa Northern Railroad at a single site.
After its condition deteriorated substantially, Tampa Union Station was closed in 1984; Amtrak passengers used a temporary prefabricated station building (nicknamed an "Amshack") located adjacent to the station platforms after the building was closed. In 1988, it received local landmark status from the City of Tampa.
Restoration.
Tampa Union Station was acquired in 1991 by the nonprofit Tampa Union Station Preservation &amp; Redevelopment Inc. (TUSP&amp;R) via a mortgage held by CSX, the freight railroad company which was the corporate descendant of its original railroad owners. TUSP&amp;R raised over US$4 million for the building's restoration through grants and loans from sources including the Florida Department of Transportation (ISTEA funds), the City of Tampa (grant funds) and the National Trust for Historic Preservation (no interest loan). At the completion of the restoration by Rowe Architects Incorporated in 1998, the station reopened to Amtrak passengers and the public. CSX donated the station to the City of Tampa that same year.
During the course of the restoration, numerous abandoned documents from the Pullman Company, Tampa Union Station Company, and the Seaboard Air Line Railroad were discovered in the station. TUSP&amp;R volunteers sorted these documents and preserved them by archiving them at the University of South Florida Library (USF) Special Collections Department and (in the case of the Pullman Company materials), the Newberry Library in Chicago.
In September 2008, a permanent endowment for the care and upkeep of Tampa Union Station was established at the Community Foundation of Tampa Bay by a group of private donors. Income from the endowment goes to the City of Tampa to assist with the maintenance of the facility. A nonprofit called Friends of Tampa Union Station was founded that year.
On November 10, 2024, the "Silver Star" was merged with the as the "Floridian".

I Don't Know How to Love Him

"I Don't Know How to Love Him" is a song from the 1970 album and 1971 rock opera "Jesus Christ Superstar" written by Andrew Lloyd Webber (music) and Tim Rice (lyrics), a torch ballad sung by the character of Mary Magdalene. In the opera she is presented as bearing an unrequited love for the title character. The song has been much recorded, with "I Don't Know How to Love Him" being one of the rare songsafter the 1950s, when multi-version chartings were commonto have had two concurrent recordings reach the Top 40 of the "Billboard" Hot 100, specifically those by Helen Reddy and Yvonne Elliman.
Composition and original recording (Yvonne Elliman).
"I Don't Know How to Love Him" had originally been published with different lyrics in autumn 1967, the original title being "Kansas Morning". The melody's main theme has come under some scrutiny for being non-original, being compared to a theme from Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor. In December 1969 and January 1970, when Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice completed "Jesus Christ Superstar", Rice wrote new lyrics to the tune of "Kansas Morning" to provide the solo number for the character of Mary Magdalene (Rice and Webber's agent David Land would purchase the rights to "Kansas Morning" back from Southern Music for £50).
Now entitled "I Don't Know How to Love Him", the song was recorded by Yvonne Elliman and completed between March and July 1970. When first presented with "I Don't Know How to Love Him", Elliman had been puzzled by the romantic nature of the lyrics, as she had been under the impression that the Mary she had been recruited to portray was Jesus's mother.
Recorded in one take at Olympic Studios in June 1970, "I Don't Know How to Love Him" has been universally acclaimed as the high point of the "Jesus Christ Superstar" soundtrack since the album's September 1970 release; in 2003 "The Rough Guide to Cult Pop" would assess Elliman's performance: "It's rare to hear a singer combine such power and purity of tone in one song, and none of the famous singers who have covered this ballad since have come close."
The choice for the first single release went, however, to the track "Superstar" by Murray Head. When a cover of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" by Helen Reddy began moving up the charts in spring 1971, the original track by Elliman was issued as a single to reach No. 28, although Reddy's version was more successful at No. 13. Both versions did moderately well on the Adult Contemporary chart, with Reddy's at No. 12 and Elliman's at No. 15. Despite the difference in chart success,"Cash Box" considered Elliman's version to be the stronger version of the song. In early 1972, Elliman's "I Don't Know How to Love Him" was issued in the UK on a double A-side single with Head's "Superstar"; with this release Elliman faced competition with a cover of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" by Petula Clark, but neither version entered the Top 40, both peaking at No. 47. Tim Rice produced several additional tracks for Elliman to complete her debut album.
Elliman performed "I Don't Know How to Love Him" when she played the Mary Magdalene role first in the Broadway production of "Jesus Christ Superstar", which opened at the Mark Hellinger Theatre 12 October 1971, and then in the movie version, her respective renderings being featured on both the Broadway cast album and the soundtrack album for the film. Her version of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" from the movie soundtrack gave Elliman a hit in Italy (No. 21) in 1974. Elliman has also performed "I Don't Know How to Love Him" when revisiting her Mary Magdalene role, first at a "Jesus Christ Superstar" concert by the University of Texas at El Paso Dinner Theatre staged 14 April 2003, and then for a live-in-concert one-night only performance of "Jesus Christ Superstar" on 13 August 2006 at the Ricardo Montalban Theater in Los Angeles.

Melanie C version.
Onstage.
English singer Melanie C performed "I Don't Know How to Love Him" in the role of Mary Magdalene during the "Jesus Christ Superstar Live Arena Tour" which had its initial UK run in September – October 2012 also playing the O2 Dublin 12 October 2012, followed first by an Australian tour in May – June 2013 and then an encore UK run in October 2012. Melanie C had debuted her performance of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" on 25 July 2012 when she sang the song to Andrew Lloyd Webber's piano accompaniment on the final of the reality-TV talent show "Superstar" broadcast by ITV. The "Adelaide Now" review of the "Live Arena Tour"'s 4 June 2012 performance at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre stated: "Melanie C absolutely blitzes her big number 'I Don't Know How to Love Him' bringing a more raw rock edge to the bridge before hitting the final big notes right out of the arena."
Recording.
Melanie C made a studio recording of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" for her 9 September 2012 album "Stages", a show tune album produced by the singer's longtime collaborator Peter-John Vettese from which "I Don't Know How to Love Him" had been issued in digital download format as a preview to rank after its first week of release at #20 on the UK Independent Singles Chart.

Non-theatrical versions.
Helen Reddy version.
Upon the release of the original "Jesus Christ Superstar" album Capitol Records executive Artie Mogull heard the potential for a smash hit in the track "I Don't Know How to Love Him" and had pitched the song to Linda Ronstadt, then on the Capitol roster; after Ronstadt advised Mogull: "she hated the song, [saying] it was terrible" Mogull invited the then-unknown Helen Reddy to record "I Don't Know How to Love Him" as part of a one-off single deal with Capitol. Reddy herself did not care for "I Don't Know How to Love Him" agreeing to cut the song to serve as B-side for the track she wished to record: the Mac Davis composition; "I Believe in Music" (later a hit for Gallery).
Background and recording.
In her autobiography "The Woman I Am", Helen Reddy states that Mogull invited her to record a single after seeing her perform on a "Tonight Show" episode (the guest host Flip Wilson had invited Reddy to appear; Wilson knew Reddy from the club circuit). Mogull himself attributed his interest in Reddy to the solicitations on her behalf by her then-husband and manager Jeff Wald who called Mogull three times a day for five months asking him to let Reddy cut a song. Larry Marks produced Reddy's recording of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" and "I Believe in Music" at A&amp;M's recording studios. According to Reddy, her extreme anxiety – "I had waited years for this shot and I didn't think there would be another one" – manifested in her vocals making "I Believe in Music" ineffectual but "I Don't Know How to Love Him" convincingly plaintive, clinching the decision to make the latter the A-side of the single, released in January 1971. In a 1974 "Billboard" tribute to Helen Reddy, writer Cynthia Spector states "I Don't Know How to Love Him" became a hit due to the efforts of Jeff Wald "who stayed on the phone morning to night, cajoling, bullying, wheedling airplay from disk jockeys. Using $4,000 of his own money, his own telephone credit card and his American Express card to wine and dine anyone who would listen to his wife, he made the record happen."
Release.
Reddy attributes the eventual success of her recording of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" to the positive listener response the track received at the first station where it was played, WDRC (AM) in Hartford, Conn. A number of the "local requests" for "I Don't Know How to Love Him" originated in Los Angeles, made by Reddy's visiting nephew—a teenage Australian actor with a penchant for different voices—and also a number of Reddy's friends, with Reddy admitting: "I may have made a call or two myself."
 In April 1971 WDRC program director Charles R. Parker would relate how Reddy and Wald had visited WDRC to thank the station for its initial support of Reddy's "I Don't Know How to Love Him," with Reddy and Wald expressing how they "were more than delighted and surprised to see [the track] break on Top 40 at WDRC."
Chart impact.
Reddy's recording of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" entered the national charts in March 1971 – showing in the Top Ten in Dallas and Denver that month – but its momentum was so gradual as to not effect Top 40 entry until that May; by then MCA Records had issued the original Yvonne Elliman track as a single and from 15 May 1971 to 26 June 1971 both versions were in the Top 40 with Reddy's version maintaining the upper hand peaking at No. 13 while Elliman's version peaked at No. 28. "I Don't Know How to Love Him" became Reddy's first major hit single in her native Australia, peaking at No. 2 on the "Go-Set" Top 40 chart for two weeks in August 1971 with an eventual ranking as the No. 8 hit for the year 1971. On Australia's Kent Music Report, the song also reached No. 2, but stayed at that position for eight consecutive weeks. The track also afforded Reddy a hit in Europe with a March 1972 peak of No. 14 in Sweden—the Swedish production of "Jesus Christ Superstar" had begun a record-setting run in February 1972—and an April 1972 peak of No. 23 in the Netherlands.
The success of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" led to Reddy's being signed to a long-term contract by Capitol who released her "I Don't Know How to Love Him" album in August 1971. The track issued as a follow-up single: a version of Van Morrison's "Crazy Love" stalled short of the Top 40 at No. 51, while the album charted with a moderate No. 100 peak; Reddy's subsequent success, however, garnered her debut album sufficient interest for it be certified as a Gold record in 1974. Also of note, the "I Don't Know How to Love Him" album included an initial arrangement of Reddy's signature song, "I Am Woman" which via a 1972 re-recording with a new arrangement would prove to be the vehicle to consolidate Reddy's stardom, reaching No. 1 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 dated 9 December 1972.
Other non-theatrical versions.
The earliest single version of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" was that cut by Karen Wyman an artist on the roster of MCA/Decca Records the label of release for the original "Jesus Christ Superstar" album: Wyman's single, produced by Ken Greengrass and Peter Matz, was released in November 1970 in the US and was also released in 1970 in the UK. Introduced on her May 1971 album release "One Together", Wyman's "I Don't Know How to Love Him" had reached #101 in Record World's "The Singles Chart 101–150" during a December 1970 – January 1971 eight-week tenure.
A version of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" done in medley with "Everything's Alright", also from "Jesus Christ Superstar", was recorded on the Happy Tiger label by a group credited as the Kimberlys; released in January 1971 the same week as the Helen Reddy version, the Kimberleys' track received enough regional attention to reach No. 99 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 that March.
Dutch vocalist Bojoura had a 1971 single release of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" with the song relegated to B-side status, the single's A-side being "Everything's Alright".
The appearance of Helen Reddy's version on the "Billboard" Hot 100 also drew the single release of the version of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" by Petula Clark which single – produced by Johnny Harris – would be Clark's last released on Warner Brothers.
In the British Isles "I Don't Know How to Love Him" first became a hit in the Republic of Ireland where Tina &amp; Real McCoy took it to No. 1 in December 1971. In January 1972 the version by Petula Clark was released in the UK to chart at No. 47 marking Clark's final appearance on the UK Singles chart except for the 1988 remix of her 1964 hit "Downtown". Clark's "I Don't Know How to Love Him" was to be her final single release on Pye Records. Concurrent with Clark's version, the original Yvonne Elliman track was issued as a single on a double A-side with "Superstar" by Murray Head; this single peaked at UK No. 47. Tony Hatch, who had produced Petula Clark's hit singles of the 1960s, had produced a version of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" by his then-wife Jackie Trent, which was issued as a single 5 November 1971: Hatch would later produce a rendition of the song by Julie Budd for her 1972 self-titled album. A 1972 version by Sylvie McNeill on a UK 45, United Artists UA UP35415, was released (11 August) timed for the first UK stage musical of "Jesus Christ Superstar"; she had actually performed it on "The Benny Hill Show" (original air date: 23 February 1972).
Petula Clark also recorded "I Don't Know How to Love Him" in French as "La Chanson de Marie-Madeleine" which served as the title cut for a 1972 French language album which also featured Clark's version of "I Don't Know How to Love Him". "La Chanson de Marie-Madeleine" became a chart item (#66) for Clark in Quebec in March 1972 despite being bested in France by the Anne-Marie David version from the Paris cast recording which reached No. 29.
In 1972, Cilla Black recorded the song for "Day by Day with Cilla" – her seventh and final studio album to be produced by George Martin. Black revealed in her 2003 autobiography "What's It All About" how she had worked so hard to produce the song which she loved but as her record label EMI Records were having industrial action the album was delayed a year. The singer went on to explain "Disappointed though I was, there was at least a crumb of comfort for me when Tim Rice hailed my recording as 'the definitive version'." Also in 2003, Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote for the booklet of Black's compilation album "The Best of 1963–78" "Her version of 'I Don't Know How to Love Him' in my opinion stands up alongside her other great songs...". Black's original vocal was remixed for her 2009 club remixes album "Cilla All Mixed Up".
Shirley Bassey recorded "I Don't Know How to Love Him" for her 1972 album release "And I Love You So" with the track having a single release as the B-side of the title track. Johnny Harris, who'd produced Petula Clark's version of "I Don't How to Love Him", was the producer of Bassey's "And I Love You So" album (Noel Rogers was credited as executive producer) and on that album's "I Don't Know How to Love Him" track Harris acted as arranger/conductor.

The Ice Break

The Ice Break is an English-language opera in three acts, with music and libretto to an original scenario by Sir Michael Tippett. The opera received its premiere at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 7 July 1977, conducted by Colin Davis, the dedicatee of the opera.
One meaning of the opera's title is a reference to the actual physical breaking of ice on the frozen northern rivers, signaling the advent of spring. The composer has said that the subject of the opera is "whether or not we can be reborn from the stereotypes we live in." John Warrack has noted that the work "confronts questions of stereotype on a wider scale" compared to Tippett's earlier operas, and also in a contemporary setting. Tippett himself put this line on a preface page to a published score of the opera, the opening of François Villon's "Ballade des pendus:":
Performance history.
A German translation was given at the Kiel Opera House the year following its premiere. The Opera Company of Boston staged the work in May 1979 for 3 performances, under the direction of Sarah Caldwell, in the first professional production of a Tippett opera in the USA. Covent Garden revived the opera in the same year, but was not thereafter seen until a 1990 concert production at the Henry Wood Proms in the Royal Albert Hall in 1990. A recording was made with the 1990 cast.
Birmingham Opera Company, in partnership with 45 arts and social organizations in Birmingham who provided the amateur actors to perform in the many crowd scenes in the opera, gave the second UK and third in total production of the opera, in five promenade-style performances of the opera in the B12 warehouse in the Digbeth area of central Birmingham, in April 2015. Graham Vick directed the production, with the Birmingham Opera Company Chorus and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Andrew Gourlay.
Synopsis.
Prior to the action of the opera, Nadia had emigrated with her baby son, Yuri, after her husband, Lev, had been sentenced to the prison camps of Russia.
Act 1.
The opera opens in an airport lounge, where Lev, a Russian dissident, arrives to join his wife, Nadia, and his son, Yuri, in the West in exile after 20 years in prison. In the airport also are Yuri's girlfriend Gayle and Gayle's friend Hannah, who are also waiting the arrival of the black athlete, Olympion, a Muhammad Ali-like character. Lev and Olympion separately arrive. Lev reunites with Nadia and Yuri, but Yuri feels distant from Lev, since he has never met his father as an adult. In the meantime, Gayle throws herself at Olympion, which angers Yuri and causes him to attack Olympion, who knocks him down. Back at home, Yuri expresses anger at his father.
Act 2.
Among Olympion's fans, there are gang rivalries which crystallise into a conflict between blacks and whites. Gayle and Yuri wear masks and blend into the masked white chorus, while the same is true on the black side for Olympion and Hannah. The conflict explodes into a mob riot, and Olympion and Gayle die in the violence. Yuri is barely alive and is taken to hospital.
Act 3.
Nadia, on the brink of death, asks Hannah to take care of Lev. In an interlude, the psychedelic messenger Astron has appeared, and a drugged-out crowd hails him as a saviour. Astron dismisses this and disappears. Back in the hospital, Yuri has undergone successful surgery, and is totally encased in a plaster cast. The cast is cut away, and Yuri stands. Yuri eventually embraces his father.

Fergal Ryan

Fergal Ryan (born 17 February 1972) is an Irish retired hurler who played as a right corner-back for the Cork senior team.
Born in Blackrock, Cork, Ryan first played competitive hurling whilst at school at Coláiste Chríost Rí. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Cork minor hurling team, before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut during the 1992–93 National Hurling League. Ryan went on to win one All-Ireland medal, two Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal.
As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Ryan won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he has a three-time championship medallist with Blackrock.
His uncle, Terry Kelly, had a lengthy career with Cork and Dublin.
Throughout his career Ryan made 17 championship appearances for Cork. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 2002 championship.
Playing career.
Club.
Ryan played his club hurling with Blackrock and had several successes in his more than two-decade long career. After enjoying little success in the minor and under-21 grades, he later became a member of the Rockies senior team.
After losing the senior decider in 1998, Blackrock were back in the final once again the following year. A 3–17 to 0–8 trouncing of University College Cork gave Ryan his first championship medal.
Blackrock surrendered their championship title the following year, but bounced back and returned to the decider again in 2001. Divisional side Imokilly provided the opposition, and a 4–8 to 2–7 victory gave Ryan a second championship medal.
In 2002 Blackrock reached the championship decider for a second successive year and faced an up-and-coming Newtownshandrum. A goal by Alan Browne was the key to securing a 1–14 to 0–12 victory and a first two-in-a-row since 1979. It was Ryan's third championship medal in four seasons.
Inter-county.
Ryan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor hurling team in 1990. He made his debut in that grade against Clare in the provincial decider. A 1–9 to 0–9 victory gave Ryan a Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider pitted Cork against Kilkenny. Trailing by ten points at half-time Cork staged a comeback to draw the game 3–14 apiece. The replay four weeks later saw Ryan's side hampered as Brian Corcoran had to withdraw due to injury. Cork were beaten on that occasion and lost 3–16 to 0–11.
Three years later in 1993 Ryan was in his last season with the Cork under-21 team. He was introduced as a substitute in the provincial decider and collected a Munster medal following a 1–18 to 3–9 defeat of Limerick.
On 4 June 1995 Ryan made his senior debut for Cork in a 2–13 to 3–9 Munster semi-final defeat by Clare.
Cork qualified for the National League decider in 1998, and a 2–14 to 0–13 win over Waterford gave Ryan a National Hurling League medal. 
After a seven-year hiatus Cork claimed the provincial title in 1999. A 1–15 to 0–14 defeat of three-in-a-row hopefuls Clare gave Ryan his first Munster medal. Cork later faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider on 12 September 1999. Cork trailed by 0–5 to 0–4 after a low-scoring first half. Kilkenny increased the pace after the interval, pulling into a four-point lead. Cork moved up a gear and through Deane, Ben O'Connor and Seánie McGrath Cork scored five unanswered points. Kilkenny could only manage one more score – a point from a Henry Shefflin free – and Cork held out to win by 0–13 to 0–12. It was Ryan's sole All-Ireland medal. He later won an All-Star.
Ryan won a second Munster medal in 2000 as captain of the side, as Cork retained their title following a 0–23 to 3–12 defeat of Tipperary.
Inter-provincial.
Ryan was also selected for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games.
After facing defeat by Connacht in his debut season in 1999, Ryan was appointed captain of the side the following year. A 3–15 to 2–15 defeat of Leinster gave him a Railway Cup medal.
Personal life.
Born in Blackrock, Ryan was educated locally at Scoil Barra Naofa Buachaillí in nearby Beaumont and later attended Coláiste Chríost Rí. It was here that his interest in Gaelic games was first developed. Ryan later worked as a sales representative with United Beverages, becoming regional manager in 2003.

Vero station

Vero station, also known as Vero Beach station, is a historic Florida East Coast Railway train station in Vero Beach, Florida. It is located at 2336 Fourteenth Avenue.
History.
Prior to the station, the railroad stop was known as mile marker 350. The station was built in 1903 as a 1-story Wood-Frame Vernacular building with shingle-sides. It was enlarged and remodeled 1916 and 1936.
Until a series of train terminations in the 1950s and early 1960s trains such as the "City of Miami" (from Chicago), "East Coast Champion" (from New York City) and the "Havana Special" (New York City) made stops at Vero Beach. Passenger service ended on July 31, 1968.
The station structure was bought from the Florida East Coast Railway by the Indian River County Historical Society in September 1984 for $1. In December 1984, it moved a short distance from the original location on the east side of the railway tracks on Commerce Avenue to 2336 14th Avenue west of the tracks.
On January 6, 1987, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as the Vero Railroad Station. The building now hosts a county historical exhibit center.

Takatsuki-class destroyer

The "Takatsuki"-class destroyer was a series of four destroyers constructed for and operated by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Built between 1964 and 1970, the destroyers were mainly used for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) duties and were designed to operate the DASH unmanned ASW drone system. The system did not work and was removed from all four ships in 1977. In the mid-1980s, the first two ships of the class were modernized, receiving surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles. The final two ships were scheduled to be modernized, but the program was cancelled.
Modernization.
From 1985 to 1988, "Takatsuki" and "Kikuzuki" were upgraded with Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missile launchers, Harpoon missile anti-ship missile launchers, Phalanx CIWS systems ("Kikuzuki" only), new FCS (FCS-2-12) fire control radar and TASS. "Mochizuki" and "Nagatsuki" were in the upgrade program, but were eventually not upgraded.

Soloveitchik

Soloveitchik ( ) (also Soloveichik) is a surname. The name is a diminutive form of the Russian word соловей, "nightingale", since the Soloveitchiks are a family of Levites, who are commanded by the Torah to sing in the Beit Hamikdash. It is notably the name of a rabbinic family descended from Yosef Dov Soloveitchik (Beis Halevi) (1820-1892). Members include:

Bobbi Humphrey

Barbara Ann "Bobbi" Humphrey (born April 25, 1950) is an American jazz flutist and singer. She has recorded twelve albums over the course of her career, mostly playing jazz fusion, funk, and soul-jazz. In 1971, she was the first female instrumentalist signed by Blue Note and in 1994, she founded the jazz label Paradise Sounds Records.
Early life.
Humphrey was born in Marlin, Texas, and raised in Dallas. She graduated from Lincoln High School, Dallas, in 1968. Her flute education included classical and jazz in high school. She continued her studies at Texas Southern University and Southern Methodist University. Dizzy Gillespie saw her play at a talent contest at Southern Methodist and inspired her to pursue a music career in New York City. She followed his advice, moving to New York in June 1971, and she got her first break performing at the Apollo Theater on Amateur Night.
Career.
Within weeks of arriving in New York, Humphrey was signed by George Butler to Blue Note. She had already begun playing regularly throughout the city, including joining Herbie Mann on stage in Central Park and an impromptu performance on "The Tonight Show". She was asked to join the final band of trumpeter Lee Morgan, performing on his last Blue Note album in 1971. Morgan contributed to Humphrey's first album, "Flute-In", in 1971.
She has played with Duke Ellington and George Benson. Benson and Humphrey were guest musicians on Stevie Wonder's single "Another Star" from his "Songs in the Key of Life" (1976) album. In 1976, she was named Best Female Instrumentalist by "Billboard" magazine.
Humphrey has played at the Apollo Theatre, Hollywood Bowl, Carnegie Hall, Montreux Jazz Festival, Russian River Jazz Festival (Northern California). She cites Hubert Laws, Herbie Mann, and James Moody as influences.
"Blacks and Blues", recorded in 1973 with the Mizell Brothers, was one of her biggest selling albums for Blue Note. On this album she shifted from the straight ahead jazz of her first two albums produced by George Butler. She sought out the Mizell Brothers after their work on Donald Byrd's "Black Byrd", which combined funk with jazz. "Blacks and Blues" was recorded in three days at the Sound Factory. In "Harlem River Drive" and other tracks, Humphrey's playing was improvised. As Humphrey recalled in an interview in 2006, "In other words, they would play the track in the background and just tell me to play to it. There was no written melody. Growing up, the music they listened to was doo-wop. And from that background, they intrinsically understood harmony. So they would already have the chord changes and background vocals laid out. I just played what I felt off the top of my head against that." Humphrey sings vocals on "Just a Love Child" and the album's last track, "Baby's Gone". "Blacks and Blues" peaked at no. 84 on the "Billboard" 200, where it spent a total of 21 weeks, making this her first album to chart.
"Satin Doll", recorded in 1974, continued her combination of soul jazz and funk. The album was dedicated to Duke Ellington, who died shortly before the album was released, and its cover art features Humphrey's daughter, Ricci Lynn. "Satin Doll" was her second and final record to chart on the "Billboard" 200, where it peaked at no. 30 and spent a total of 18 weeks. "Fancy Dancer" marked Humphrey's third and final collaboration with the Mizell Brothers. It includes Latin percussion and harp instrumentation by Dorothy Ashby. For her next album, "Tailor Made", she switched to Epic.
Despite high album sales, Humphrey did not see much of her Blue Note albums' financial success. In 1977, she moved into the business side of the music industry. She incorporated Innovative Artist Management as well as a publishing business, The Bobbi Humphrey Music Company, which signed an agreement with Warner Bros. in 1990. Humphrey brought Tevin Campbell into the music industry and was involved in his negotiations with Warner Bros. In 1994 Humphrey started her label, Paradise Sounds Records, and released "Passion Flute" that year.
Humphrey's works, notably "Blacks and Blues", have been sampled by Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Grand Puba, Digable Planets, Mobb Deep, Ludacris, and Ice-T. In 2002, Common invited her to play on his album, "Electric Circus".

Brisker method

The Brisker method, or Brisker "derech", is a reductionistic approach to Talmud study innovated by Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik of Brisk (Brest, Belarus), as opposed to the traditional approach which was rather holistic. It has since become popular and spread to yeshivas worldwide. The Brisker method is also known as the "conceptual" approach to Talmud study and is often referred to simply as "lomdus" (lit. "analytical study").
See .
Theory.
Broadly speaking, before the Brisker method, Talmudic texts were taken at "face value" unless there was a compelling reason not to. If a contradiction between two texts was discovered, then it became necessary to reinterpret one or both texts to reconcile them, but there was no standard method by which to perform this reconciliation. Any explanation that one offered, which seemed reasonable, would be accepted.
The Brisker method replaces this approach with a methodical search for precise definitions of each concept involved in the discussion. Once the mechanism by which a law works is rigidly and correctly defined, it can become clear that one aspect of the definition applies in one situation but not another. Therefore, the final halacha (Jewish law) will differ in the two situations, even if they superficially appear to be very similar.
Often an entire series of disagreements among the "Rishonim" (Talmudic commentaries from roughly the period 1000–1500) may stem back to a subtle difference in how these Rishonim understand a line from the Talmud. The Brisker method can provide a precise formulation of how each Rishon understood the topic and thus account for their differences in opinion. This approach is most spectacular when a whole series of debates between two Rishonim can be shown to revolve around a single "chakira", or difference in the understanding of a Talmudic concept.
Another benefit of this approach is that it helps clarify the puzzling Talmudic statement that "Elu vi'Elu Divrey Elokim Chaim" (lit. these [words] and these [words] are the words of the living Lord). In other words, the Talmud advances the idea that no "valid" interpretation of its corpus is strictly wrong. Rather, a multitude of opinions can be justifiably put forth on a particular subject. According to the Brisker approach, this idea is explained in conceptual terms. Both opinions accepted the same facts, so none are strictly wrong. However, one opinion conceptualized the issue through one logical prism, whereas the other viewed the issue via an entirely different logical prism (see Examples below). It is easier, then, to accept that both opinions are Divinely justifiable approaches, as their fundamental point of departure is theoretical rather than physical in nature.
The Brisker method is not a total break from the past. Rabbis before Brisk sometimes made "conceptual" distinctions, and Brisker rabbis can still resolve issues without recourse to the terminology they invented. The difference is one of focus and degree. Non-Brisk analysis tends to formulate "conceptual" definitions only when necessary, while for Briskers, these definitions are the first and most common tool to be used when approaching a Talmudic issue.
One example of Rabbi Chaim's emphasis on the value of precise definition can be found in quote: "One approach which answers three different problems is better than three different approaches to individually solve the three problems" (a corollary of Occam's razor).
Examples.
Some of the distinctions which follow may appear to be meaningless: the two alternatives are simply different ways of expressing exactly the same concept. This is indeed a significant danger when formulating Brisker concepts. Therefore, it is routine, upon formulating the distinction, to search for a "nafka minnah" for the distinction - an empirical case in which the two understandings in fact lead to different results. Only when a "nafka minnah" (even a rare and impractical one) is identified can one be sure that one's Brisker distinction is valid. Each distinction listed below has at least one "nafka minnah", even if not specified here.
History.
The famed yeshiva of Volozhin, arguably the first modern yeshiva, favored a traditionalist approach towards Talmudics under the leadership of the Netziv, which often required absorbing a great amount of Talmudic material to acquire a "general Talmudic feel" before analyzing a topic. Later, however, Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik became a lecturer at Volozhin. At this point, around the year 1880, Rabbi Chaim's new methods first became public.
However, as Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik suggested in his eulogy for the Brisker Rov, the full, true "Brisk approach" as we know it today was not developed until Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik had been rabbi of Brisk for many years. The notes that Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik used for his lectures at the yeshiva of Volozhin (years before he assumed the Brisk pulpit) are still extant today, and the approach found there is not as well-developed as in (his and others') later published works. The notes could best be described as "proto-Brisk lomdus", a term which could be used regarding the works of the "Beis HaLevi" as well. Several modern scholars agree with this notion of "proto-Brisk", and it can be heard in the lectures of Rabbi Dr. Aaron Rakeffet-Rothkoff. Nonetheless, as seen above, even "proto-Brisk" was already different enough and popular enough to cause significant tension at the Volozhin yeshiva.
An additional major influence on the "Brisk approach" was a Rabbi Mendel Epstein of Slutzk. Rabbi Chaim "Brisker" Soloveitchik spent several early teenage years in Slutzk, where Rabbi Epstein served as his melamed (Judaics teacher for pre-college levels). Rabbi Chaim later claimed that much of the "Brisker derech" attributed to him was founded on Rabbi Epstein's approach; however, as a small town's melamed, Rabbi Epstein and his ideas never achieved fame.
The Brisker method has a certain parallel in the Dor Revi'i (commentary on Hullin) of Rabbi Moshe Shmuel Glasner. Many scholars had been perplexed by the Rambam's rulings, as they had been used to understanding the Talmud according to the Franco-German school of Rashi and Tosafot, as opposed to the Babylonian Geonic school followed by Rambam. Rabbi Glasner insisted that Rambam's interpretations follow perfectly from the Talmud once he is interpreted on his own terms. Rabbi Glasner's methods coincided remarkably with those of Rabbi Chaim; Rabbi Glasner's methods caused a sensation in the Lithuanian yeshivot in the late 1920s and early 1930s, producing astonishment that a Hungarian rabbi had independently formulated a method so similar to Rabbi Haim's.
Controversy.
When it first appeared, some scholars denounced the Brisk approach as "chemistry", as it sought to analyze each Talmudic law by breaking it down into components, whereas a traditionalist approach focused more on the entirety of the laws.
While the Brisker method has won acceptance in almost all yeshivas today, it has its opponents. These include Rabbi Avraham Yeshayahu Karelitz (1878–1953) (known as the "Chazon Ish"), who felt that often the existing approach to a Talmudic portion was sufficient.
Additionally, the Brisker method is not widely used in modern yeshivas which stem from the Mirrer Yeshiva (originally from Russia), which instead tend to stress single, unifying themes throughout Talmudic concepts, often focusing on only one "Rishon" if it is seen as the most "truthful" approach to a Talmudic passage. 
Yeshivot influenced by Telz, likewise, adopt a broader approach.
See also .
In Brisker yeshivas, the tractates studied deviate from the tractates popular in most yeshivas. Most yeshivas learn the Talmudic laws of money, property, marriage, and divorce. In Brisk, there is a greater tendency toward Kodashim tractates, as well as Nazir and Sotah (more ritually oriented) tractates in Nashim. Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik is noted for a tendency to study tractates in Seder Moed, a tendency formalized by Yeshiva University's decision to learn a tractate from Seder Moed every four years.
R Chaim was aware of the opposition to his method, but defended it. In response to a rabbi who insisted on taking the words of the Gemara at face value, R Chaim replied: A term may refer to different laws in different contexts. For example, the Talmud requires "panim chadashos" (meaning "a new presence" or "new faces") at the Sheva Brachos celebration, i.e. a guest must be present who had not attended the wedding. Elsewhere, the Talmud comments that once sacrificial meat has been burned to ashes, the ashes no longer have a sacrificial status, as "panim chadashos ba'u l'chan" – "a new presence has arrived", meaning that the ashes are not the same as the meat. "So if you were at a Sheva Brachos party, and you looked around and everyone there had already been at this couple's wedding, why not just take some meat and burn it to ashes?", challenged Rabbi Chaim. Clearly, the phrase "panim chadashos" has different meanings in the contexts of wedding celebrations and sacrificial meat.
R Chaim was also opposed to those that took the method farther than he did. In response to The Rogachover Gaon who claimed that Kiddushin does not take effect once for all time, but rather constantly renews itself every moment (has a "), R Chaim simply and sarcastically replied "Mazel Tov" (as if to say that according to such a view, the Rabbi had just gotten married); thereby indicating his view that such an approach was ridiculous. The Rogachover responded that the original Mazel Tov that R Chaim had wished him at his wedding was also constantly being renewed and so would suffice.

Little sleeper shark

The little sleeper shark (Somniosus rostratus) is a small sleeper shark of the family Somniosidae found in the northeast Atlantic, western Mediterranean, and western Pacific around New Zealand (though these records may be of another species), at depths between 200 and 1,000 m. Its length is up to 1.43 m.
Distribution.
This species is rarely encountered. It has in the northeast Atlantic and western Mediterranean. It has also been found in Israel and Cuba.
Habitat.
Although currently the species has been found in water at depths of 180–2200m, it is possible that it may range deeper. It is a bathydemersal species found above sandy mud substrate on the outer continental shelves and on the upper slopes.
Ecology.
Reproduction and Growth.
"S. rostratus" reaches a maximum size of 140 cm. Males mature at 71 cm. Females mature at 80 cm and are aplacental viviparous, giving birth to 8–17 pups per litter. Much about the reproduction of this species is still unknown.
Diet.
This species feeds on cephalopods such as those of the genus "Histioteuthis" and "Todarodes sagittatus". Although the species is often caught using fishing gears for bottom-dwelling fish, the presence of these fast-moving prey items in stomach contents suggests that this organism moves throughout the deeper areas of the water column. This may partially explain the lower than expected rates of capture in deep demersal fisheries.
Threats.
"S. rostratus" is occasionally taken on longlines and in bottom trawls in the eastern Atlantic. It is often recorded under the category "sleeper sharks" or "sharks". It is often discarded at sea when caught on the Mediterranean coast of Spain and not landed. Post-discard survival is likely very rare, though. The fish has also been historically fished for off the coast of Portugal, however by 1996 this industry had all but ended.
This animal is also caught as bycatch of general demersal and black scabbardfish fisheries in the Azores.
These threats are compounded by the fact that, like other Squaloid sharks, the Little Sleeper shark is likely to be slow to mature, and the relatively small range of the fish.
Conservation.
Although no species-specific conservation measures are in place, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean has banned bottom trawling below depths of 1000m. More information is needed on the species before detailed protection can be brought in to action.

Drascombe

The word Drascombe is a trademark that was first registered by John Watkinson who applied it to a series of sailing boats which he designed and built in the period 1965–79 and sold in the United Kingdom (UK). They comprised the Coaster, Cruiser Longboat, Dabber, Drifter, Driver, Gig, Launch, Longboat, Lugger, Peterboat, Scaffie, Scaith and Skiff, together with a few other one-offs. They have wide and deep cockpits, adaptable boomless rigs and high bulwarks.
The word drascombe is also used as a generic term for any boat built to a design by John Watkinson. These include both 'the Drascombe range' build by Churchouse Boats and the 'Original Devon' range produced by Honnor Marine,
The Caboteur and Drifter 22 have been designed and built recently following the design principles developed by John Watkinson.
John Watkinson died in 1997 and the trademark is now owned by his surviving family. Current builders include Churchouse Boats Limited.
Past licensees include McNulty; John Elliott and Douglas Elliott Boatbuilders (licensed to build in wood); and Kelly and Hall, which built the original production Luggers in wood.
Design principles.
There are basically two types of drascombe. There are undecked open day sailers and one or two-berth weekenders. They were originally designed and built in marine plywood using glued lapstrake construction. As they became more popular, they were then manufactured in GRP.[3]
The hull, typically, consists of four strakes each side, the garboard strakes being wide giving a flat run to the transom whilst having a fairly sharp entry at the stem. There is a recessed rear deck level with side benches and a recessed foredeck. Some models have a small one or two-berth cabin.
The transom slopes back at an angle of about 45 degrees with the top edge sloping forward giving drascombes a distinctive appearance at the stern. Just forward of the transom is a well to take an outboard motor with a slot in the transom that allows the outboard motor to be tilted out of the water when under sail. It also keeps the outboard motor hidden from view.
The usual rig consists of a Gunter rigged mainsail set on the main mast, a mizzen sail set on the mizzen mast sheeted to a bumpkin and a foresail. The tan-coloured sails are all boomless to avoid possible head injury from a gybing boom. The original Drascombe Lugger had a lug sail to start with; this was changed to a gunter mainsail but the name was kept.
The rudder fits in a case which is set in the aft deck in front of the mizzen mast. It can be lifted up into the case when in very shallow water.
A steel centreboard is in a centreboard case with a purchase to lift it.
Some (Dabber and Drifter) have a conventional vertical transom with the rudder hung on the transom.
Some (Skiff, Scaith, Scaffie and Peterboat) were double enders with a canoe stern. Of these, the Skiff has no outboard motor well, just a mini triangular transom to take a small outboard motor when the rudder has been removed.
Flotilla.
Caboteur.
The Caboteur is based on the drascombe Longboat but modified to the requirements of French drascombe aficionado Jean-Louis Grenier to create his "ultimate drascombe camping cruiser"
Originally in wood epoxy the hull is now available in GRP. It is 8" wider in the beam than the Longboat with 3" more freeboard. The rig is also larger and a cruising chute can be set to a bowsprit.
Jean-Louis' boat has a large sleeping platform and a vast amount of dedicated storage. The great number of lockers, together with the added beam and freeboard make the sailing weight nearly twice that of a Longboat.
Coaster.
 A trailer-sailer with a two-berth cabin (and, with the addition of a cockpit tent, room for two more) including cooking and toilet facilities. Replaced the Cruiser Longboat, having a much improved specification, especially with regard to the cockpit and cabin layouts.
Cruiser Longboat.
A Longboat with a cabin of two berths or one berth and a galley bench. Unlike the open Longboat and other drascombes a boom was fitted to the mainsail. Designed to appeal more to private buyers than the open version, the Cruiser Longboat was introduced and sold side by side with the standard open boat. Introduced in 1970 and replaced in 1979 by the Coaster. Over 400 were built. The wooden versions were all custom built and differ considerably from the GRP versions.
Dabber.
Although smaller than the Lugger, the Dabber carries a full yawl rig on main and mizzen masts. However, the Dabber can easily be distinguished by its bowsprit and transom-hung rudder. 
Drifter.
A cruising boat with a cabin and choice of outboard well or 6-8 hp Sabb inboard Diesel engine. Draft 2'+. Long keel with fixed bilge plates. Original spec included sails with roller-reef jib, pramhood canopy, two-burner paraffin cooker, flushing chemical toilet, fitted bilge pump, anchor warp and chain; anti-fouling below waterline. An optional tent was also available, extending sleeping accommodation from two to four adults.
Drifter 22.
At the 2007 London Boat Show Churchouse Boats launched the Drifter 22.
Paul Fisher of Selway-Fisher was employed to revise the design of the original Drifter.
The prototype was built in wood/epoxy but moulds have been made and production boats are manufactured in GRP.
In 2021 Churchouse Boats re-launched the Drifter 22 with a Mark II model, under the Drascombe Boats brand.
Driver.
An 18' version of the Launch hull with bilge fins for sailing. A Watermota Shrimp inboard petrol engine with fully feathering propeller was fitted. A petrol/paraffin version of the Watermota or even a diesel were available to special order. For sailing it had a standing lug rig similar to the Dabber but with a slightly larger jib and mainsail.
Gig.
Never intended for the private buyer, the Gig is a pure sail training craft designed for use by Navies. Previously, the Royal Navy used the Montagu Whaler for this purpose, but these boats were getting well past their best, and new ones have not been built since the 1950s. The Longboat was considered too small, so the Gig was designed for this specific market. The French navy now uses four Gigs for this purpose.
Today a number of privately owned Gigs are about - two were fitted with cabins ("Hippo" and "Gig"). One was fitted with a tent to allow for extensive cruising ("The City of London").
In private hands the Gig is not for the novice. She has a fairly big sail area and handles and feels like a big boat. At the same time, once in tune with her, she gives her crew great confidence by her easily reefed lug sail and her sea keeping capabilities.
Launch.
Based on the Dabber hull and introduced in 1973, the Launch was designed for river and lake fishing. Fitted with a Watermota Shrimp inboard engine and a Dabber mizzen as a steadying sail. Not a very successful model, only 12 being built.
Longboat.
Essentially a stretched Lugger, and originally intended as a training craft for sailing schools, Sea Scouts, etc.
Lugger.
The boat that started it all, and still as immensely popular as at its introduction at the Earls Court (London) Boat Show in 1968, when the first wooden production boat, "Luka" was sold within 29 minutes of the show's opening to the public. "Luka" is now located in the National Maritime Museum Cornwall. The epitome of rugged simplicity, reliability, and seaworthiness in an open boat, the Lugger is equally at home pottering with the kids or undertaking more adventurous expeditions.
Peterboat.
Designed by John Watkinson in 1973, the Peterboat was not mass-produced and never built in GRP. Only about 10 wooden boats were built by John Elliott, John Kerr, and Norman Whyte. There was an original version of a Peterboat built by John Watkinson, similar decking arrangement to the drascombe Lugger, but with a gunter rig sporting a curved yard with a large jib,(similar to the rig on 'Cariad') only the one was ever built.
Scaffie.
A smaller drascombe for single-handed sailing, the Scaffie has no centreboard, relying instead on a long central keel and two bilge stub keels. Rig is a single standing lugsail.
Scaith.
Double ended open boat with a standing lug main, small offset mizzen with bumkin and a jib, a folding rudder and galvanised steel centreplate. An outboard motor well is incorporated on the aft port side to carry a small (2 hp) outboard motor. The forerunner to the Peterboat 4.5m.
Skiff.
Similar to the Scaffie but with a narrower beam, the Skiff was designed in 1970 and John Watkinson built the first three boats of around 30 that were built in wood by Doug Elliott at John Elliott Boatbuilders. A GRP version wasn't available until 1996.
Notable voyages.
David Pyle sailed his wooden Drascombe Lugger "Hermes" from England to Australia during 1969 and 1970. This was possibly the longest journey ever undertaken in a small open sailing boat (though, later, in 1991, a complete circumnavigation was completed by Anthony Steward in an open 19' boat). "Hermes" was a standard production model with the exception of a raised foredeck and a few other minor modifications. The boat was built at Kelly and Hall's boatyard at Newton Ferrers by John and Douglas Elliott.
In 1973, Geoff Stewart crossed the Atlantic in a Longboat.
Between 1978 and 1984, Webb Chiles sailed round most of the world in his Luggers "Chidiock Tichborne I" and "Chidiock Tichborne II". Starting in California in "Chidiock I", he crossed the Pacific, then the Indian Ocean, before heading into the Red Sea. Near Vanuatu during the Pacific crossing, the boat capsized during bad weather, then drifted for two weeks while he was unable to bail his flooded boat. After becoming damaged, "Chidiock I" was seized by the Saudi Arabian authorities when Chiles was arrested on suspicion of being a spy. Chiles had a new Lugger, "Chiddiock II", shipped to him in Egypt. This he sailed south to cross his previous track and then through the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea out into the Atlantic to La Palma in the Canary Islands. Leaving the boat briefly to visit Tenerife, he returned to find that she had capsized at her mooring in a storm. Finding that he had lost a lot of gear, Chiles decided to end his attempt at circumnavigating in an open boat.

JDS Amatsukaze

JDS "Amatsukaze" (DDG-163) was a guided missile destroyer (DDG) of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), and the only ship of her class. She was the first Japanese surface combatant equipped with surface-to-air missiles. 
Development.
JDS "Amatsukaze" was planned as the DDG variant of the preceding "Akizuki"-class anti-aircraft destroyers, mounting the American Tartar Guided Missile Fire Control System weapon system. However, the Tartar system turned out to be larger than expected, so "Amatsukaze"s design was altered completely, with an enlarged hull and with a shelter-deck design based on that of the and uprated steam turbines.
Construction and career.
She was laid down on 29 November 1962 and launched on 5 October 1963 by Mitsubishi shipyard in Nagasaki. Commissioned on 15 February 1965.
From July 1 to July 31 of the same year, she participated in the maritime training in the direction of Guam with the escort vessels JDS "Haruna", and .
Participated in Exercise RIMPAC 1980 from January 25, 1980, and from February 26 to March 18, the first joint exercise of the Maritime Self-Defense Force with the escort ship JDS "Hiei" and eight P-2J patrol aircraft as part of the USS "Constellation" Task Force. She succeeded in all four ship-to-air engagements during the exercises against OPFOR launched from the Royal Australian Navy aircraft carrier HMAS "Melbourne". She was highly regarded as the best-performing ship in this exercise for subsequently preventing USS "Sargo", also part of the aggressor force, from "finishing off" the "Constellation". "Amatsukaze" returned to Japan on April 2.
From July 1 to July 31, 1992, she participated in the maritime training in the Philippines with the escort vessels JDS "Setoyuki", JDS "Asayuki" and JDS "Mineyuki".
Removed from the register on November 29, 1995. During the active period of 30 years and 9 months, the total voyage was 764,314 miles (about 1.4 million km), the total voyage time was 62,999.53 hours, and the Maritime Self-Defense Force exercises participated 19 times, integrated exercises 4 times, and 9 times. She was eventually sunk as an actual target for anti-ship missiles off Wakasa Bay. 
Her port propeller is left at Yokosuka Education Corps, the starboard propeller is left at Yokosuka naval base, and the main anchor is left at Maizuru naval base.
Tartar missiles.
"Amatsukaze" was one of the earliest foreign ships equipped with the American Tartar system. (The other is the French "Kersaint"-class DDG). Because of the financial burden of this expensive weapon system, the other equipment aboard "Amatsukaze" was almost the same as that of the at first, but the JMSDF applied a spiral model to "Amatsukaze", allowing continual updating of her equipment as described in the following table.
The Tartar weapon system made a strong positive impression on the JMSDF, but it was too expensive for the JMSDF to be able to afford another Tartar-equipped DDG at once. As a result, the JMSDF had to wait 10 years to build another DDG, the first destroyer.

This Jesus Must Die

"This Jesus Must Die" is a song from the 1970 album and 1971 rock opera "Jesus Christ Superstar" by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, which also appears in the film versions of "Jesus Christ Superstar", and on the original album of the musical. In the song, the priests, led by Caiaphas and Annas, plot to kill Jesus Christ, whose teachings they believe will result in a Roman crackdown against its Jewish population.
In the 1973 film, it is sung primarily by Bob Bingham as Caiaphas and Kurt Yaghjian as Annas; and on the 1970 album, by Victor Brox as Caiaphas and Brian Keith as Annas, with Paul Raven and Tim Rice providing the voices of the priests. In the 2000 film, it is sung by Frederick B. Owens as Caiaphas and Michael Shaeffer as Annas.
Synopsis.
According to the official "Jesus Christ Superstar" website, in the song:
The song begins with the Jewish priests fretting over the influence of the "rabble-rousing" Jesus, but merely plotting to have him arrested. It is Caiaphas who insists that the threat posed by a Roman crackdown, "our elimination, because of one man", can only be averted by the death of Jesus, which would deliver a demoralizing blow to his followers.
Analysis.
The song is noted for, after a slow beginning, launching into more of a "rock and roll" feel than many other songs in the musical, and being sung by a "growling bass-voiced Caiaphas and his screechy tenor minions". The song has also been described as "a throwback to pre-Second World War depictions" of "threatening Jews", although "their evil is somewhat modified". The priests sing a melody that comes from J. S. Bach's Bourrée in E minor.
The appearance of the song in the musical and in the film version of "Jesus Christ Superstar" is highlighted by an "emphasis on style". The film uses "low camera angles which give a distorted view of the priests", and "gives the priests extraordinary costumes", which includes "enormous, bizarrely shaped hats", black flowing robes, and "bare chests crossed by leather straps and chains".

Nguyễn Hồng Nhị

Nguyễn Hồng Nhị (1936 – 26 November 2021) was a Vietnamese MiG-21 fighter ace in the Vietnam People's Air Force's 921st Fighter Regiment.
Nguyễn was amongst the first group of VPAF pilots selected from the 910th Air Training Regiment to train in the Soviet Union to fly in the new MiG-21 fighter jet. He was the very first VPAF MiG-21 pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft on 4 March 1966. Eight kills have been attributed to him with three confirmed by the United States Air Force. However, it was common practice for the American side to claim that their aircraft were downed by surface-to-air missiles or anti-aircraft guns, which is considered "less embarrassing" than losing in a dogfight/air-to-air combat to the enemy pilot.
On 1 August 1968, he and two other MiG-21 pilots, Nguyen Dang Kinh and Phan Van Mao, flew out in a newly-devised trio formation from Tho Xuan, and encountered USN F-4 Phantoms and F-8 Crusaders. While successfully shooting down an F-8 with his second R-3S AAM after the first one missed, he engaged in a dogfight with the other F-8. He succeeded in targeting the F-8 in his sights, but his weapons system failed to properly engage due to what he believed were electrical problems. Two more F-8s then arrived, firing two Sidewinders that succeeded in shooting down Nguyen, who then safely ejected from his stricken MiG-21; his downing was credited to F-8H pilot Lt. McCoy of VF-51, USS "Bon Homme Richard".
The following aerial victories include kills known to be credited to him by the VPAF:

Yakov Polonsky

Yakov Petrovich Polonsky (; ) was a leading Pushkinist poet who wrote poems faithful to the traditions of Russian Romantic poetry during the heyday of realistic prose.
Of noble birth, Polonsky attended the Moscow University, where he befriended Apollon Grigoryev and Afanasy Fet. Three young and promising poets wrote pleasing and elegant poems, emulating Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov. He graduated from the university in 1844, publishing his first collection of poems the same year. Polonsky's early poetry is generally regarded as his finest; one of his first published poems was even copied by Nikolai Gogol into his notebook.
Unlike some other Russian poets, Polonsky did not belong to an affluent family. In order to provide for his relatives, he joined the office of Prince Vorontsov, first at Odessa and then (1846–51) at Tiflis. The spectacular nature of the Black Sea coast strengthened his predilection for Romanticism. Polonsky turned his attention to the Caucasian subjects and descriptions of lush nature, treated in the manner reminiscent of Lermontov (although he also wrote parodies of his poems). Nocturnal scenes especially appealed to him; in fact, one of his best known poems is called "Georgian Night".
In 1849, Polonsky paid homage to the mountaineer folklore in his collection "Sazandar". His verse epistle to Leo Pushkin (the poet's brother), known as "A Stroll through Tiflis" (1846), was written with more attention to realistic detail. In 1851, Polonsky moved to Saint Petersburg, where he was invited to edit the literary journal "Russkoye Slovo". He soon gave up journalistic activities and continued his career at the censorship department. At that period, Polonsky would increasingly venture into social themes, without producing anything of lasting value. He was the last luminary of the 1840s still active in St. Petersburg of the 1890s, maintaining correspondence with such younger writers as Anton Chekhov. He died at the age of 78 and was buried in his native Ryazan.
Although Polonsky was highly regarded in his own day, his reputation has been in predictable decline during the last brutal century and a half. His most popular pieces are lyrical songs, notably "Sleigh Bell" (1854), "in which the sound of a sleigh bell evokes a dream state and images of lost love". Unsurprisingly, many of his poems were set to music by Russian composers including Alexander Dargomyzhsky, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Sergei Taneyev, and Anton Rubinstein. He also provided the libretto of "Vakula the Smith" after Gogol, intended for Alexander Serov, finally made into a competition piece and set by Tchaikovsky (1874), who reworked it later as "Cherevichki".

At inter-county level, Landers enjoyed an unsuccessful tenure with the Cork minor and under-21 teams before later winning an All-Ireland Championship with the junior team in 1994. He joined the Cork senior team in 1995. From his debut, McCormack was ever-present as a midfielder or centre-forward and made a combined total of 48 National League and Championship appearances in a career that ended with his last game in 2002. During that time he was part of the All-Ireland Championship-winning team in 1999. McCormack also secured two Munster Championship medals and a National Hurling League medal. After leaving the Cork senior team in 2002 he returned to the inter-county scene as a member of the Kerry senior hurling team in 2008.

McCormack first lined out for Cork as a member of the minor team during the 1991 Munster Championship. He made his first appearance for the team as a 16-year-old on 16 April when he lined out at centre-back in a 6-19 to 0-15 defeat of Kerry.
McCormack was eligible for the minor grade again the following year and retained his place on the starting fifteen, however, he was switched from centre-back to centre-forward. He played his last game in the minor grade on 1 May 1992 when he scored two points in a 1-11 to 0-11 defeat by Tipperary.
In spite of being still eligible for the minor grade, McCormack was also added to the Cork under-21 team for the 1992 Munster Championship. He made his first appearance for the team on 17 June and scored a point from centre-forward in a 1-10 to 0-11 defeat by Waterford.
On 23 July 1993, McCormack was selected to play in the Munster final. He lined out at centre-back and ended the game with a winners' medal following the 1-18 to 3-09 defeat of Limerick.

McCormack won a second successive Munster Championship medal on 3 July 2000 after lining out at centre-forward but being held scoreless in Cork's 0-23 to 3-12 defeat of Tipperary in the final.
McCormack's appearance for Cork were limited to just two during the 2001 National League. He was ruled out of Cork's subsequent Munster Championship campaign due to a leg injury.
Cork qualified for the 2002 National League final on 5 May, with McCormack starting on the bench as he had done for all of Cork's league games that season. In the week leading up to the game there had been speculation that Gaelic Players Association members from both teams would stage a protest during the parade before the match with their socks down and jerseys out - offences punishable by fine under the GAA's match regulations. The Cork players went ahead with their pre-match protest before losing the final by 2-15 to 2-14. McCormack played his last game for Cork on 26 May when he lined out at centre-forward in Cork's 1-16 to 1-15 defeat by Waterford in the Munster Championship. He was an unused substitute for the rest of Cork's unsuccessful championship campaign. On 21 August, McCormack gave an interview on 96FM in which he stated that the players were treated as "second-class citizens." He went on to say: "There is almost a them and us attitude between players and officials and the perception that we are only players. I have been involved in the panel since 1995 and that problem has always been there. Players of the past have, I know from talking to them, felt the same way but did not really come out and said anything about it." The dissatisfaction between the players and the Cork County Board culminated with all 30 members of the Cork panel were withdrawing their services from the county in the hope of better treatment from the county board on 29 November. McCormack played a low-key role during the negotiations over the following two weeks before a settlement was reached on 13 December. While the player's demands were met, McCormack never played for Cork again.
Kerry.
On 12 April 2008, it was announced that McCormack declared for [Kerry under the rule which allows up to five "outside" players to join weaker hurling counties. He was also eligible to play for the team under the parentage rule. McCormack was an unused substitute throughout Kerry's unsuccessful Christy Ring Cup campaign and left the panel at the end of the season.
Munster.
McCormack was selected for the Munster inter-provincial team for the first time during the 1998 Railway Cup. He made his first appearance on 8 November when he came on as a substitute in a 2-15 to 0-09 defeat by Leinster.
McCormack was selected for the Munster team again the following year and was included on the starting fifteen. On 25 November 1999, he lined out at centre-forward when Munster suffered a 2-23 to 1-15 defeat by Connacht in the final.

Factotum (novel)

Factotum (1975) is a picaresque novel by American author Charles Bukowski. It is Bukowski’s second novel and a prequel to "Post Office" (1971).
Plot.
Set in the 1940s, the plot follows Henry Chinaski, Bukowski's perpetually unemployed, alcoholic alter ego, who has been rejected from the World War II draft and makes his way from one menial job to the next (hence a "factotum"). After getting into a fight with his father, Chinaski drifts through the seedy city streets of lower-class Los Angeles and other American cities in search of a job that will not come between him and his first love: writing. Much of the novel is dedicated to describing various menial jobs that Chinaski temporarily holds during the USA’s WWII economic boom. Even though some of Chinaski's jobs and colleagues are described with great detail, they all eventually end with him either abruptly leaving or being fired.
He is consistently rejected by the only publishing house he respects, but is driven to continue by the knowledge that he could do better than the authors they publish. Chinaski begins sleeping with fellow barfly Jan, a kindred spirit he meets while drowning his sorrows at a bar. When a brief stint as a bookie finds him abandoned by the only woman with whom he is able to relate, a fling with gold-digging floozie Laura finds him once again falling into a morose state of perpetual drunkenness and unemployment.
Film adaptation.
"Factotum" was adapted into a film of the same name in 2005, directed by Bent Hamer and starring Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor and Marisa Tomei.

Roan Creek

Roan Creek is a tributary of the Watauga River that rises near the border between the U.S. states of Tennessee and North Carolina. Its source is located along the slopes of Snake Mountain near Trade in Johnson County, Tennessee. From its source, Roan Creek flows north, then turns west around the northern end of Stone Mountain. Then it flows south and west through Cherokee National Forest in the valley between Stone Mountain and Doe Mountain, until entering the Watauga River and Watauga Lake, the reservoir behind Watauga Dam. Its waters eventually flow through the Watauga River, the Holston River, the Tennessee River, the Ohio River, and the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.
In 2005 Roan Creek was cited as one of the top ten most endangered rivers by American Rivers, a national non-profit conservation organization focused on rivers.

Max Gradel

Max-Alain Gradel (born 30 November 1987) is an Ivorian professional footballer who plays as a winger.
Gradel received his first call-up to the Ivory Coast national team in November 2010. He made his debut for the national side on 5 June 2011. On 30 April 2011, Gradel won both the Fans Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year awards at Leeds. In June 2018, he joined French club Toulouse.
Club career.
After moving to the UK from Paris, France, in 2004, Gradel attended Lewisham College Football Academy under the tutelage of then Head Coach Aaron Jacob, who was one of his early mentors. He attended the Bon Giourno Cup in the Netherlands, and the team went on to win the trophy, conceding no goals, with Gradel scoring 11 of 17. He was due to attend the Dallas Cup with the team but was offered a Pro contract and made the decision not to go. "Everything started at Lewisham College," says Gradel. "We were all good players in the Football Academy; I think I made it a bit by chance.
Gradel began playing football in the Ivory Coast when he was two years old. After leaving Lewisham College, Gradel was offered trials with Arsenal, Chelsea, West Ham United and Leicester City and spent four months with Arsenal before signing with Leicester. From there he moved to Leeds United where he played regularly for the Championship side.
Gradel was given a squad number for the 2007–08 season. On 5 May 2007, he signed his first professional contract with Leicester along with seven other players, including Eric Odhiambo, Andy King and Carl Pentney.
Loan at AFC Bournemouth.
On 6 August 2007, Leicester City manager Martin Allen made Gradel and Conrad Logan available for loan for the forthcoming season. Three days later, Gradel joined AFC Bournemouth on an initial one-month loan, which was extended for the season on transfer deadline day (31 August). However, he was unable to play as many games with the Cherries as he had hoped due to the death of his mother in early October. As a result, he was told by Bournemouth manager Kevin Bond that he could take all the time he needed to return to England.
He returned to Leicester early on 3 January 2008, although Bond stated he wanted to take him back to Bournemouth on loan again, a move which was completed for the rest of the season on 11 January. Gradel's form at Bournemouth earned him a new three-year deal at Leicester, which he signed on 6 February.
Return to Leicester and promotion.
He made his league debut for Leicester against Milton Keynes Dons on 9 August 2008, setting up a goal as Leicester won 2–0 at the Walkers Stadium. On 14 August, Gradel signed a new contract that would last until June 2012. He scored his first senior goal in a 2–1 FA Cup defeat to Crystal Palace on 14 January 2009, and his first league goal in a 2–2 draw against MK Dons on 28 February, scoring an equalising free-kick at injury time. His free kick away at MK Dons won the Goal of the Season award at the Leicester City Supporters Club Awards on 23 April. Gradel made 32 appearances in all competitions as Leicester secured their promotion as league champions.&lt;ref name="Leicester 2008/2009 player appearances"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the following season however, Gradel made just one substitute appearance in the League Cup.
Leeds United.
2009–10 season.
On 19 October 2009, Gradel joined Leeds United on loan for a month. He made his debut as a substitute in a 2–1 win over Norwich City that same evening. Gradel scored his first goal for Leeds on 31 October against Yeovil Town within minutes after coming on as a substitute, which prompted chants from the crowd of "Grayson sign him up".
Leeds manager Simon Grayson said he wanted to extend Gradel's loan move beyond the initial month. Gradel himself stated he would like to extend the loan deal at Leeds and even hinted he would be happy to move to Leeds on a permanent deal. Leicester refused Leeds permission to play Gradel in their FA Cup game against Oldham Athletic. Gradel started his first game for Leeds in the 3–1 win against Grimsby Town, contributing to Leeds' first goal as his cross was diverted by Olly Lancashire into his own net. The game would have been the last of Gradel's initial one-month loan. The loan was extended to 2 January 2010 on 13 November.
Gradel scored the winning goal for Leeds in the 89th minute against Leyton Orient after coming off the bench for Leeds. He made his first start in the league for Leeds against Oldham. He provided two assists in the same game for Neil Kilkenny's and Luciano Becchio's goals. Gradel scored three minutes after coming on for Leeds as a substitute in the West Yorkshire derby against Huddersfield Town. He made his second league start for Leeds in the game against Brentford, due to the suspension of Robert Snodgrass.
Gradel replaced Jermaine Beckford as a substitute against Southampton, and he made an immediate impact in the same game; minutes after coming on, Snodgrass curled a shot into the top right corner to seal Leeds' win. Gradel handed in a transfer request on his return to Leicester, and he was signed by Leeds United on a two-and-a-half-year contract on 25 January for an undisclosed fee. His first appearance as an under contract Leeds player came as a second-half substitute in the 3–0 defeat to Swindon Town.
After being unavailable for Leeds' FA Cup loss against Tottenham Hotspur, Gradel came back into the Leeds squad and the starting lineup against Hartlepool United in Leeds' 2–2 draw. He retained his place in the starting XI for the next game against Carlisle United in the Trophy second leg game, which Leeds won 3–2 but were knocked out 6–5 on a penalty shootout, with Gradel converting his penalty for Leeds. After Jermaine Beckford returned from injury Gradel dropped back to Leeds' bench.
Gradel received the man of the match award against Yeovil Town in Leeds' 2–1 win. In the following game Gradel kept his place up front and scored for Leeds against Southend United in a 2–0 win. Then, he followed it up in the next match scoring in a 3–1 away win against Carlisle United, with Gradel opening up the scoring and Luciano Becchio scoring a brace. Gradel's sixth goal for Leeds came in Leeds' 4–1 win against MK Dons. Gradel was sent off for violent conduct in Leeds United's final match of the 2009–10 season against Bristol Rovers when after a moment of madness he got himself sent off then refused to leave the pitch in the first half of the match, but Leeds won the game 2–1 and were promoted to The Championship.
2010–11 season.
Gradel played his first game back at Elland Road since his red card against Bristol Rovers, with him putting in an impressive performance when Leeds completed their pre-season campaign on 31 July with a 3–1 win over Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers at Elland Road. Gradel scored a goal in the game by scoring a long-range effort. Due to Gradel's red card the previous season and his refusal to leave the pitch, he missed the first four games of the season through suspension.
Gradel returned from his four match suspension in the second round of the League Cup when he made his first start of the season against his former club Leicester. He managed to gain an assist in the game, providing a cross for Davide Somma's goal. His first league appearance came in the following game, when he came on as a second-half substitute in the 1–0 win away to Watford. Gradel made his first league start of the season, when Lloyd Sam was dropped for the game against Swansea City on 11 September. Gradel scored his first goal of the Championship season against Scunthorpe United. Gradel scored his second goal of the season against Coventry City after scoring a penalty. Gradel's third goal of the season came against Norwich City. Gradel scored his fourth goal of the season against Burnley which started Leeds's comeback to win 3–2 after being 2–0 down. On 18 December, Gradel scored his fifth and sixth goals of the season when he scored both goals in Leeds' 2–0 win over league leaders Queens Park Rangers. Gradel scored his seventh goal of the season against his former club Leicester City with a header
Gradel's form for Leeds saw him attract interest from Premiership clubs. Gradel scored his eighth goal of the season against Portsmouth. Newcastle United showed an interest in Gradel but manager Simon Grayson confirmed that he wasn't looking to sell the in-form player. After an impressive December, Gradel was named as one of the nominees for The Championship player of the month. On 8 January, Gradel won a penalty against Arsenal which was scored by Robert Snodgrass as Leeds earned an impressive 1–1 draw. Then on 15 January, Gradel scored his ninth goal of the season against Scunthorpe United Gradel scored his 10th goal of the season against Bristol City. On 22 February, he scored his 11th and 12th goals of the season in the home fixture against Barnsley. Gradel's 13th and 14th goals of the season came in the same game in the 5–2 win against Doncaster Rovers. Gradel's impressive form for Leeds during the 2010–11 season earned special praise by manager Simon Grayson. On 2 April, Gradel scored his 15th and 16th goals of the season against Nottingham Forest. Gradel scored his 17th goal of the season against Derby County in Leeds' 2–1 loss. On 30 April, Gradel won Leeds' 2010–11 Player Of The Year Award and also the Players Player Of The Year Award at Leeds annual Player award ceremony. After winning the award Gradel announced that he wanted to stay at Leeds to help them reach the Premier League. Gradel also revealed he would like to extend his contract at Leeds. Gradel scored his 18th goal of the season in the final match in Leeds' 2–1 win against Queens Park Rangers. In the summer of 2011 Gradel was believed to have been interesting German club Hamburger SV.
2011–12 season.
With several clubs interested in Gradel and much speculation on his future, he confirmed on 24 July that he was looking to stay with Leeds. On 2 August, Gradel confirmed he wanted to stay at Leeds, but the club had yet to offer him a new contract. It was revealed on 4 August, Gradel would miss the League Cup match against Bradford City as he had been called up to the Ivorian squad. Gradel scored a late penalty in the first game of the 2011–12 season against Southampton, however it proved to be only a consolation goal as Leeds lost 3–1. Gradel was sent off early on for two bookable offences in a defeat against Middlesbrough; teammate Jonny Howson was also sent off for Leeds in the same match. Gradel came back into the starting lineup after serving his one match suspension against West Ham on 21 August, Gradel missed a penalty for Leeds in the same game. Gradel's final game for Leeds came in the 2–1 loss against Ipswich Town.
Saint-Étienne.
On 30 August 2011, Gradel joined French club Saint-Étienne for an undisclosed fee, reported to be £3 million. He signed a four-year contract with the club. He was handed the number 9 shirt upon his arrival at the club. In the 2014–15 season, Gradel was Saint Etienne's top scorer in Ligue 1 with 17 goals, also providing three assists.
Return to AFC Bournemouth.
On 4 August 2015, after four years in France, Gradel returned to England to join former side and Premier League newcomers Bournemouth on a four-year deal for a reported fee of £7 million. As part of the deal Gradel's old club Leeds United received a percentage of the transfer fee due to a 10% sell on clause.
On 29 August, Gradel tore a cruciate ligament in his knee during the match against Leicester City, with the injury ruling him out for six months. On 27 February 2016, Gradel made his return to the team, coming on as a substitute in the 21st minute for Junior Stanislas in a 0–0 draw against Watford. Gradel scored his first goal after his return to the club in a 3–2 win over Swansea City on 12 March 2016.
Toulouse.
After a return of just a single goal in 25 Premier League appearances for Bournemouth, Gradel was loaned to Toulouse for the 2017–18 season. Following his impressive stint on loan, the Ivory Coast winger was handed a permanent contract with Toulouse on 1 July 2018. He returned 28 goals in 68 matches across all competitions for the French side. Gradel contributed three goals and two assists in Ligue 1 during the 2019–20 season, but his efforts were not enough to save Toulouse from being relegated to the second division.
Sivasspor.
On 16 August 2020, Gradel joined Turkish Süper Lig club Sivasspor on a free transfer after mutually agreeing to terminate his contract with former club Toulouse. In his first season with the club, he was named in the Süper Lig team of the season and as the league's best winger. On 26 May 2022, Gradel scored a goal in the final of the Turkish Cup against Kayserispor. Sivasspor won 3–2 after extra time for their first cup title.

Dull Gret

Dulle Griet (anglicized as Dull Gret), also known as Mad Meg, is a figure of Flemish folklore who is the subject of a 1563 oil-on-panel by Flemish renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The painting depicts a virago, Dulle Griet, who leads an army of women to pillage Hell, and is currently held and exhibited at the Museum Mayer van den Bergh, in Antwerp.
History and description.
A restoration of the painting in 2018 revealed that it was painted in 1563, shortly after the painter had moved to Brussels. Previously, the signature and the date on the painting had been illegible, and it was assumed that it was painted two years earlier, or, based on its close compositional and stylistic similarity to "The Fall of the Rebel Angels" and "The Triumph of Death", one year earlier. Like those pictures, "Dulle Griet" owes much to Hieronymus Bosch. It is assumed the painting was destined for a series.
Bruegel's earliest biographer, Karel van Mander, writing in 1604, described the painting as "Dulle Griet, who is looking at the mouth of Hell". It came into the collections of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, then was looted by the Swedish troops in 1648, and reappeared in Stockholm in 1800. Art collector Fritz Mayer van den Bergh discovered it in 1897 at an auction in Cologne, where he bought it for a minimal sum, discovering its actual author a few days later.
Her mission refers to the Flemish proverb:
She could plunder in front of hell and return unscathed.
In the view of Max Seidel, Roger H. Marijnissen in their book 'Bruegel. Pt.2', Bruegel is making fun of noisy, aggressive women. At the same time he castigates the sin of covetousness: although already burdened down with possessions, Griet and her grotesque companions are prepared to storm the mouth of Hell itself in their search for more. It might also refer to something that is either stupid, or courageous, or both; implying that one who is dull or naive may have more courage and end up in trouble, though not succumbing but making the best of it. Could symbolize a woman defying hell and returning with treasure, a psychological analogy of working through troubles to become stronger and wiser; to enter into one's personal hell and overcome one's "demons" i.e. fears or trauma. Yet, the opinions may differ and are subjective.
Griet was a disparaging name given to any bad-tempered, shrewish woman. In an incisive historical and critical interpretation of the painting, Margaret Sullivan concludes that in it Bruegel allegorizes the ideological zeitgeist's “madness and folly.” She notes that “in the sixteenth century ‘dulle’ had two meanings. The first was ‘mad’ and the second (and older) meaning was ‘foolish’ or ‘stupid.’ ‘Griet’ as a female name communicated the idea of a fool. . . The name Margaret and its variants Margot, Magrite, Greta, Griet, etc., seemed to have acquired pejorative connotations throughout Northern Europe, making it an especially appropriate choice for the painting.”
Dulle Griet appears as a character in Caryl Churchill's play "Top Girls" (1982), where she recounts her invasion of Hell: "I'd had enough, I was mad, I hate the bastards. I come out my front door that morning and shout till my neighbors come out and I said, 'Come on, we're going where the evil come from and pay the bastards out. (Churchill, 28).
Details.
While her female followers loot a house, Griet advances towards the mouth of Hell through a landscape populated by Boschian monsters (see detailed images). They represent the sins that are punished there. Griet wears male armour — a breastplate, a mailed glove and a metal cap; her military costume is parodied by the monster in a helmet beside her, who pulls up a drawbridge. A knife hangs from her side, while in her right hand she carries a sword, which may refer to the saying: "He could go to Hell with a sword in his hand." A book of proverbs published in Antwerp in 1568 contains a saying which is very close in spirit to Bruegel's painting:One woman makes a din, two women a lot of trouble, three an annual market, four a quarrel, five an army, and against six the Devil himself has no weapon.
Painting materials.
The pigment analysis was conducted by the scientists at the Ghent University. Bruegel used the cheap smalt for the robe of the central figure of Mad Meg instead of the more expensive ultramarine together with vermilion and copper resinate.
Cultural depictions.
In 2006, Belgian comic book artist Hermann Huppen, known by his pen name Hermann (https://hermannhuppen.be/), published an album (number 13) in The Towers of Bois-Maury series titled "Dulle Griet" with Glénat Éditions. The script was written by his son, Yves H. The story is a fictional narrative set against the historical backdrop of the Catholic Inquisition's persecution of Lutherans in Flanders at the beginning of the 16th century. The story attempts to give real meaning to the madness of the woman Dulle Griet.
In 2018, "Dull Margaret", a graphic novel by Jim Broadbent inspired by "Dulle Gret", was published by Fantagraphics Books.

2006 Progressive Democrats leadership election

The Progressive Democrats leadership election, 2006 began on 7 September 2006 when Mary Harney resigned as leader of the Progressive Democrats. In spite of speculation earlier in the year surrounding her position as leader, Harney's announcement surprised many. She had been leader of the party since 1993.
Election procedure.

If several candidates put their names forward, an electoral college will determine the next leader. Each college member will have one vote, but these votes will be weighed according to which group they belong to. TDs, Senators and MEPs will form the first group which represent 40% of the votes. Councillors, national executive members and trustees of the party will form the second group which represent 30% of the votes. The third group contains party members for more than one year prior to the date of the leadership election. This group represent 30% of the votes.
Candidates.
Nominations for the leadership closed on midday Monday, 11 September 2006.
Michael McDowell was nominated for the position of Party Leader by Tom Parlon and that nomination is to be seconded by Liz O'Donnell.
Result.
Despite speculation of differences, Michael McDowell was elected unopposed, and remained in office until he resigned on losing his seat in the 2007 general election.

Melchor Liñán y Cisneros (sometimes "Melchor de Liñán y Cisneros") (December 19, 1629, Madrid – June 28, 1708, Lima, Peru) was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Lima (1677–1708), Archbishop of La Plata o Charcas (1672–1675), Bishop of Popayán (1667–1672), and Bishop of Santa Marta (1664–1668). He also served as Viceroy of Peru from July 7, 1678, to November 20, 1681.
Biography.
Melchor de Liñán y Cisneros was born in Madrid, Spain. He studied theology in the University of Alcalá de Henares, where he took his doctorate. Thereafter he was chaplain in Buitrago. He was also "calificador" (censor) of the Holy Office of the Inquisition. On October 6, 1664, Pope Alexander VII, appointed him Bishop of Santa Marta. In 1665, he was consecrated bishop by Antonio Sanz Lozano, Bishop of Cartagena.
On January 26, 1668, Pope Clement IX, appointed him Bishop of Popayán.
In 1671, he was sent as "visitador" (inspector) to Nuevo Reino de Granada in what is now Colombia because of the inaction of Diego de Villalba y Toledo, president of the "Audiencia". He replaced Villabla in that position on June 2, 1671. At the same time he served as interim governor and captain general of Nuevo Reino de Granada. On February 8, 1672, Pope Clement X, appointed him Archbishop of La Plata o Charcas. On June 14, 1677, Pope Innocent XI appointed him Archbishop of Lima. On July 7, 1678, he was appointed viceroy of Peru serving until November 20, 1681. As viceroy, he improved the fortifications of the port of Callao to defend against attacks by Dutch filibusters. He repressed rebellions of the clergy, who were opposed to the nomination of prelates from Spain—the Franciscans in Cuzco and the Dominicans in Quito.
On the death of the Peruvian astronomer Doctor Francisco Ruiz Lozano, Viceroy Liñán y Cisneros (with the approval of the Crown) gave mathematics a permanent position in the University of San Marcos. Mathematics was attached to the chair of cosmography. Doctor Juan Ramón Koening, a Belgian by birth, was named to the chair.
As a reward for his services, the Spanish Crown granted Liñán y Cisneros the title of "conde de la Puebla de los Valles". He wrote "Ofensa y defensa de la libertad eclesiástica" ("Offense and Defence of Ecclesiastical Liberty"). He died in Lima in 1708.

While bishop, he was the principal consecrator of:

Bill Rawlings

William Ernest Rawlings (3 January 1896 – 25 September 1972) was an English footballer. A centre-forward, he scored more than 196 goals in 367 league games in a 15-year career.
He began his career with Southampton in 1918, who were elevated from the Southern League to the Football League in 1919. He finished as the club's top-scorer eight times in nine seasons from 1920–21 to 1927–28, helping the Saints to win the Third Division South title in 1921–22 and to reach the FA Cup semi-finals in 1925 and 1927. He also won himself two England caps in 1922, both of which were from British Home Championship games. He signed with Manchester United in March 1928 and moved on to Port Vale in November 1929. He picked up a serious ankle injury while with the Valiants. He moved on Newport via New Milton the following year before retiring in 1933.
Early and personal life.
William Ernest Rawlings was born on 3 January 1896 at Clatford Lodge, Upper Clatford near Andover, Hampshire. He was the second of four children to William and Jane (née Barlow); his father was a domestic coachman and later ran The Elephant Inn in Andover. Rawlings worked as an assistant grocer before becoming a professional footballer. Rawlings was playing for hometown club Andover when he enlisted to fight in World War I in 1914, aged 18. He served with the Wessex Field Ambulance and was awarded the 1914 star. He married Ethel M. Brown in 1921. He became a licensee in the 1930s, running the Glebe Hotel in Southampton from July 1930. He spent 25 years as a civil servant in the Admiralty, based in Wareham.
Career.
Southampton.
Rawlings' career started in 1918 with an apprenticeship at Southampton, having impressed playing against their reserve team for his regiment two years previously. He turned professional in February 1919 and made his first-team debut against Swansea Town on 1 September. He quickly settled into the side, building a formidable attacking partnership with Arthur Dominy. He scored 19 goals in the Southern League in 1919–20. The Saints were then elected into the Football League, becoming founder members of the Third Division. He became the club's top scorer in 1920–21 with 22 goals, as Southampton were denied promotion despite finishing in second place. He hit 32 goals in 1921–22 to win himself attention at a national level and to help his club win the Third Division South title. His intelligent play and deadly shooting earned him two England caps. He appeared against Wales and Scotland in the 1922 British Home Championship, achieving the rare distinction of being capped for England while playing for a third-tier club.
In 1922–23, the Saints posted a respectable 11th-place finish in the Second Division, with Dominy finishing as top-scorer. Rawlings then returned to form and finished as the club's top-scorer for the third time in four seasons in 1923–24, when he found the net 21 times. Rawlings went on to remain as the club's top scorer for another four seasons, hitting 16 goals in 1924–25, 20 goals in 1925–26, 28 goals in 1926–27, and 21 goals in 1927–28. He also helped the club to reach the FA Cup semi-finals in 1927 and scored in what was a 2–1 defeat to Arsenal at Stamford Bridge. He toured Canada with an XI picked by The Football Association in 1927. Nevertheless, he was transfer-listed by the club, though offers from Everton and Newcastle United were rejected. He scored a total of 193 goals in 364 appearances in league and cup competitions during his ten years at The Dell. His 193 goals place him third on the club's list of all-time goalscorers, behind Mick Channon and Matthew Le Tissier.
Manchester United.
In March 1928, he signed for First Division side Manchester United for a fee of £4,000. He scored on his Old Trafford debut on 14 March, a 1–0 win over Everton. He hit a hat-trick on 7 April, in a 4–3 home win over Burnley, and finished the 1927–28 season with ten goals for the Red Devils. However, he was limited to six goals in 1928–29. He found all three goals of the 1929–30 campaign on 14 September, in a 3–2 win over Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park.
Later career.
In November 1929, he moved to Port Vale after the Valiants paid United a four-figure fee. Rawlings scored on his Vale debut in a 5–2 win over Accrington Stanley at the Old Recreation Ground on 9 November. He played a further five games before suffering a serious ankle injury on Christmas Day 1929, during a 2–1 home defeat by Stockport County. The "Valiants" went on to win the Third Division North title in 1929–30. He recovered to full fitness by the spring of 1930, but was unable to return to the first-team and left for New Milton during the 1930–31 season. Later, in 1930, he moved to Isle of Wight and played for Newport, where he was reunited with Dominy, winning the Hampshire Senior Cup in 1932.

Artist's statement

An artist's statement (or artist statement) is an artist's written description of their work. The brief text is for, and in support of, their own work to give the viewer understanding. As such it aims to inform, connect with an art context, and present the basis for the work; it is, therefore, didactic, descriptive, or reflective in nature.
Description.
The artist's text intends to explain, justify, extend, and/or contextualize their body of work. It places, or attempts to place, the work in relationship to art history and theory, the art world and the times. Further, the statement serves to show that the artist is conscious of their intentions, aware of their practice and its position within art parameters and of the discourse surrounding it. Therefore, not only does it describe and place, but it indicates the level of the artist's own comprehension of their field and making. The artist statement serves as a "vital link of communication between you [the artist], and the rest of the world." Most people encounter a work of art through a reproduction first, and there are many elements that are not present within a reproduction. That is why it is imperative that the artist knows how to properly convey their work through their own words. What the artist writes in their statement may be integrated in wall text, handouts at an exhibition or a paragraph in a press release. Judgments will be made based both on the nature of the art, as well as the words that accompany it.
Artists often write a short (50-100 word) and/or a long (500-1000 word) version of the same statement, and they may maintain and revise these statements throughout their careers. They may be edited to suit the requirements of specific funding bodies, galleries or call-outs as part of the application process.
History.
The writing of artists' statements is a comparatively recent phenomenon beginning in the 1990s. In some respects, the practice resembles the art manifesto and may derive in part from it. However, the artist's statement generally speaks for an individual rather than a collective, and is not strongly associated with polemic. Rather, a contemporary artist may be required to submit the statement in order to tender for commissions or apply for schools, residencies, jobs, awards, and other forms of institutional support, in justification of their submission.
In their 2008 survey of North American art schools and university art programs, Garrett-Petts and Nash found that nearly 90% teach the writing of artist statements as part of the curriculum; in addition, they found that,
Like prefaces, forewords, prologues, and introductions to literary works, the artist statement performs a vital if complex rhetorical role: when included in an exhibition proposal and sent to a curator, the artist statement usually provides a description of the work, some indication of the work's art historical and theoretical context, some background information about the artist and the artist's intentions, technical specifications – and, at the same time, it aims to persuade the reader of the artwork's value. When hung on a gallery wall, the statement (or "didactic") becomes an invitation, an explanation, and, often indirectly, an element of the installation itself.
As subject matter.
On at least two occasions, artist's statements have been the subject of gallery exhibitions. The first exhibition of artists' statements, "The Art of the Artist's Statement", was curated by Georgia Kotretsos and Maria Pashalidou at the Hellenic Museum, Chicago, in the spring of 2005. It featured the work of 14 artists invited to create artwork offering a visual commentary on the subject of artist statements. The second exhibition, "Proximities: Artists' Statements and Their Works", was installed in the fall of 2005 at the Kamloops Art Gallery, Kamloops, British Columbia. Co-curated by W.F. Garrett-Petts and Rachel Nash, the exhibition asked nine contributing artists to respond to the topic of artists’ statements by taking one or more of their own artist's statements and working with the text(s) in a manner that documented, represented, and annotated the original work, creating a new work in the process. In 2013, Workshop Press published a collection of 123 artist statements by British painter Tom Palin. The statements spanned a period of 21 years and came with a foreword by Michael Belshaw.
Artist's statements have been the subject of a research project on the professional language of the contemporary art world by sociologist Alix Rule and artist David Levine. Presented in their 2012 article "International Art English," published in the American art journal "Triple Canopy", Levine &amp; Rule collated and analysed thousands of gallery press releases, published by e-flux since 1999, in an attempt to dissect and understand the peculiar language of the professional art world. It has since become one of the most widely circulated pieces of online cultural criticism.

Conrad Heyer

Conrad Heyer (April 10, 1749 or 1753 – February 19, 1856) was an American farmer, veteran of the American Revolutionary War, and centenarian. He is often credited as being the earliest-born person to have been photographed alive, although several other contenders are known, most notably a shoemaker named John Adams and an American slave named Caesar.
Biography.
Heyer was born in the village of Waldoboro in what was later to become the state of Maine – it was then known as "Broad Bay" and was part of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. The settlement had been sacked and depopulated by Wabanaki attacks and resettled with German immigrants recruited from the Rhineland. Among these settlers were the parents of Conrad Heyer, who also may have been the first white child born in the settlement. His father died the winter before he was born. His mother, Catharina, remarried in 1772/1773 to a German immigrant. In his youth, Heyer was a member of the German Lutheran Church.
During the American Revolution, Heyer fought for the Continental Army in the 25th Regiment, according to his pension filed in 1819 and several witnesses. He enlisted in December 1775 and was honorably discharged a year later, in mid-December 1776 at Fishkill. There is no historical record of any other service in the army. Later claims, such as that Heyer participated in Washington's famous crossing of the Delaware in December 1776 or served in the Army until 1778, cannot be confirmed. 
Heyer married Mary Weber in 1776, with whom he had ten children. After the war, he returned to Waldoboro, where he made a living as a farmer until his death in 1856. He was buried with full military honors.
Around 1852, at the claimed age of 103, Heyer posed for a daguerreotype portrait. He is often credited as the earliest-born person known to have been photographed alive, although several other contenders exist. These include a woman named Mary Munroe Sanderson (1748–1852); Dr. Ezra Green (1746–1847); a shoemaker named John Adams (1745–1849); a Revolutionary war veteran named Baltus Stone, born sometime between 1743 and 1754; John Owen, said to have been born in 1735 or 1741 and an enslaved man named Caesar who, according to the inscription on his marble tombstone, was born in 1737 and died in 1852 — which would mean he lived to be 114-115 years old.

Jim St. Vrain

James Marcellin St. Vrain (June 6, 1871 – June 12, 1937), a native of Ralls County, Missouri, was a Major League Baseball pitcher. The left-hander played for the Chicago Orphans in 1902.
St. Vrain made his major league debut in a road game against the Cincinnati Reds at the Palace of the Fans (April 20, 1902). He pitched well, but the Orphans lost 2–1. His first major league win came against the New York Giants on May 9. He pitched a 5–0 complete game shutout in front of the home crowd at West Side Park.
St. Vrain pitched well during his only season but gave up a lot of unearned runs. He is also remembered for running the wrong way on the bases; although he was a left-handed pitcher, St. Vrain batted right-handed. One day, manager Frank Selee suggested he try batting left-handed, and upon making contact with the ball, St. Vrain was confused enough to run to third base (he was thrown out at first base).
In a total of 12 games, 11 starts, 10 complete games, and 95 innings pitched, he had 51 strikeouts and only 25 walks, and gave up just 22 earned runs. Though his record was 4–6, his earned run average was a sparkling 2.08.
St. Vrain died in Butte, Montana, in 1937.
