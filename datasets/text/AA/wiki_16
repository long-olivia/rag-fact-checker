Christine Lampard

Christine Louise Lampard ("née" Bleakley, born 2 February 1979) is a Northern Irish television presenter. She has presented various television programmes with Adrian Chiles, such as "The One Show" (2007–2010) and "Daybreak" (2010–2011), while with Phillip Schofield she has presented "Dancing on Ice" (2012–2014) and "This Morning" (2013–2016, 2023). Lampard has also presented factual series for ITV including "Off The Beaten Track" (2013) and "Wild Ireland" (2015). Since 2016 she has been a presenter of the ITV lunchtime chat show "Loose Women".
Early life.
Christine Bleakley was born in Daisy Hill Hospital, Newry, and grew up in Newtownards. She has a younger sister, Nicola. She started her television career as a runner and then trained to become a floor manager while studying for her A-Levels at Bloomfield Collegiate School in Ballyhackamore, Belfast. She continued to work at BBC NI while studying for a politics degree at Queen's University, Belfast. However, she did not complete her degree course, and instead moved into television work full-time.
Career.
BBC.
She worked on the long-running BBC Northern Ireland comedy "Give My Head Peace". She returned to make a cameo appearance in the show in its 2016 special.
She moved into television with BBC Northern Ireland hosting a wide variety of shows. One of her programmes was called "Sky High" which saw her flying around Northern Ireland in a helicopter in 2004. A weekly entertainment show called "First Stop" followed, and she also hosted "Would You Pass The 11+" and coverage of "Children in Need". She presented the BBC Northern Ireland cookery show, "Spill the Beans" in 2005.
Outside Northern Ireland, Lampard co-hosted BBC Two's "Let Me Entertain You" with Brian Conley and in July 2007, she became co-host of "The One Show" on BBC One, replacing Myleene Klass. She and Adrian Chiles hosted the show for three years. In January 2010, Northern Irish comedian Patrick Kielty was a guest on "The One Show", when he revealed her mobile phone number to the camera. After being bombarded with calls and text messages, she changed her telephone number.
In October 2009, Lampard co-presented "Britain's Classroom Heroes" alongside Jeremy Vine on BBC Two. In 2009, she occasionally presented "The National Lottery Draws" on BBC One. In March 2010, she co-hosted a segment of the "Sport Relief" telethon with Gary Lineker.
When Adrian Chiles left the BBC in 2010, there was a great deal of speculation on whether she would extend her BBC contract or move to ITV. After the speculation, Lampard also left "The One Show" to join ITV as the co-host of "Daybreak" following Adrian Chiles' departure from the BBC to ITV. Questions were raised in Parliament over the size and scale of the proposed £900,000 per year two-year BBC contract. Shortly after she fired her long-term manager and signed with Chiles' management company, on 20 June 2010, the BBC announced that it had withdrawn an offer to extend her current contract. Later that day ITV plc (owners of "GMTV") announced she would again partner Chiles by co-hosting the revamped breakfast show with him, and also hosting other entertainment programmes. On 8 July 2010, the BBC confirmed that she was not returning to "The One Show" after the programme returned from the World Cup break on 12 July.
In September 2016, it was announced that Lampard would return to the BBC to co-present "Christine and Adrian's Friendship Test". She co-presented the three-part series with Adrian Chiles on BBC Northern Ireland in November 2017.
ITV.
She moved to ITV less than three hours after the BBC had withdrawn their £1 million offer for her to remain on the channel. She joined ITV on a four-year contract worth £4 million.
On 6 September 2010, she joined Adrian Chiles to host ITV Breakfast's "Daybreak". The programme suffered mixed reviews and poor viewing figures in its first weeks on air, and Lampard herself was the subject of criticism. On 18 November 2011, she and co-presenter Adrian Chiles were replaced by Dan Lobb and Kate Garraway who presented on an interim basis. In September 2012, they were replaced by Aled Jones and Lorraine Kelly.
In February 2011, Lampard presented a game show pilot for ITV called "Control", but it was not commissioned for a series. From 2011 until 2015, she co-hosted ITV's Christmas telethon "Text Santa". In 2011, 2014 and 2015, she co-hosted the charity appeal with Phillip Schofield and with Paddy McGuinness in 2012 and 2013. She has hosted a number of ITV Specials, including "Simply Red: For the Last Time" in 2010, "Duran Duran: One Night Only" in 2011 and "Michael Flatley: A Night to Remember" in 2014. On Boxing Day 2012, she presented "That Dog Can Dance".
In 2011, she became Phillip Schofield's co-presenter on "Dancing on Ice", replacing Holly Willoughby. She presented three series of the show between 2012 and 2014 when it came to an end after the ninth series on 9 March 2014. For each episode of "Dancing on Ice", Lampard was paid £24,163. When she was hosting the show, she was the highest paid female television star, earning around £400 per minute. "Dancing on Ice" returned in January 2018. Holly Willoughby returned to present with Phillip Schofield, meaning Lampard no longer appears.
On 11 May 2011, she presented "The National Movie Awards". In 2013, Lampard presented a six-part series called "Off The Beaten Track". On 3 March 2014, it was announced the show had been axed.
She is a frequent stand-in host on "This Morning", subbing whenever Phillip Schofield or Holly Willoughby are unable to appear.
On 23 December 2014, Lampard co-hosted one-off documentary "Roman Britain From the Air" with Michael Scott. On 27 December 2014, she hosted the one-off magic special "Darcy Oake: Edge of Reality" and acted as Darcy Oake's assistant in two illusions, first being made to appear on a large motorcycle and then being sawed in half in Oake's Clearly Impossible sawing illusion.
In 2015, Lampard presented the six-part documentary series "Wild Ireland" which saw her travel across the Wild Atlantic Way in Ireland. In October 2016, she was a guest panellist on an episode of "Loose Women". She guest anchored numerous episodes of the show before becoming a permanent anchor.
Since February 2017, Lampard has guest presented numerous episodes of the ITV Breakfast show, "Lorraine"., and is the regular stand-in for Lorraine Kelly during school breaks.
UKTV.
In October 2016, Lampard co-presented "Celebrity Haunted Hotel Live" for UKTV's W channel. The show, which she co-hosted alongside Matt Richardson and Jamie East, aired for five consecutive nights from 27–31 October.
In 2018, Lampard and Richardson presented "Celebrity Haunted Mansion" for the W channel. It aired for five consecutive nights from 21–25 February.
"Strictly Come Dancing".
In 2008, Lampard took part in the sixth series of "Strictly Come Dancing", in which she was partnered with professional dancer Matthew Cutler.
Lampard and Cutler were eliminated on 30 November 2008, leaving the competition in fifth place, after Rachel Stevens and Vincent Simone beat them in the dance-off.
Radio.
At the beginning of her career, Lampard worked at Belfast Citybeat as a newsreader and presenter, working with Stephen Nolan.
From January to March 2015, Lampard presented a Sunday afternoon programme called "Sunday Lunch" from 3–4pm on Magic Radio.

Cure Salee

The Cure Salée (French: "Salt Cure"), or "Festival of the Nomads", is a yearly gathering of the Tuareg and Wodaabe peoples in the northern Niger town of In-Gall. The ceremony marks the end of the rainy season, and usually occurs in the last two weeks of September. The government of Niger began sponsoring the festival in the 1990s, fixing its date for each year (in 2006: September 11), its duration (three days), and bringing in dignitaries, performers, and tourists.
Traditions.
The end of the rainy season is an especially important event in the lives of Saharan pastoralists. Tuareg clans gather at the salt flats and pools near Ingall to refresh their cattle and goat herds, and to prepare for the trip further south so they can survive the dry season. The Cure Salée is also believed to benefit the local people, and medicinal cures are a major part of the festival.
However, the Cure Salée is as just as important as a social gathering. After a season in dispersed clan groups, there's the chance to share news, trade, and renew friendships both within and across ethnic lines.
For Tuareg and Wodaabe peoples, Cure Salée marks the time of traditional courtship and marriage. The most famous images of the festival are Wodaabe tradition of Gerewol, in which young men vie for the attention of women seeking husbands. Organized dances and tests of skill culminate in men donning traditional costume, headdress, and elaborate makeup.
Amongst the Tuareg peoples, women seek for the attention of marriageable men, while men of all ages show off their skills as riders, artists, dancers, musicians and craftsmen. A great parade of Tuareg camel riders opens the festival, which continues with races, songs, dances, and storytelling. While the official festival is limited to three days, the festivities can last for weeks while nomadic groups remain in the area.
Changes.
While the Cure Salée has been taking place for several hundred years, independence from France in 1960 brought the involvement of the central government from Niamey, and the attempt to formalise it as a national festival and tourist attraction. During the last in a long line of Tuareg insurgencies (See: Tuareg Rebellion) against the central government, from 1990-1995, InGall was a prime fortification of the Niger armed forces, and no official Cure Salee was held. In September 2000, a "Flamme du Paix" ceremonial 'Burning of Weapons' by the rebel and government forces in Agadez forced the first Cure Salée following the final peace deals to be hastily rescheduled.
On September 17, 2001, a much publicized Tuareg memorial was held for the victims of the 9/11 attacks in the United States.
In recent years, the Niger government has tried to promote the Cure Salée, creating a tourist festival (sponsored by large international corporations like Coca-Cola) for western visitors, and using the cross-ethnic traditions of the Cure Salée to foster "a celebration of social cohesion in Niger". This aspect has come to the fore following 2000. Official involvement also has brought a greater emphasis on culture common to the rest of Niger: electric pop bands, beauty contests, and the sometimes forced ending of other rituals. In 2005, armed Niger Army troops enforced a ban on a traditional dance that emulates self-mutilation.
One Wodaabe man was quoted by the AFP:
It is more and more of a circus. The government sets the date artificially, decides who gets to perform, and creates a structure none of us understand.
The [UN Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS], UNICEF, and the Niger government have begun using Cure Salée to provide aid in stemming HIV infection, and as well as malaria, guinea worm, malnutrition and encourage the use of vaccines to control preventable diseases. Vaccines and treatment of livestock, many bound for more heavily populated southern Niger, have also been mandated by the government. The 2004-2006 drought and famine in much of Niger has also focused attention on food aid at the Cure Salée.

Henri Coulette

Henri Coulette (November 17, 1927 – March 26, 1988) was an American poet and educator. His first book, "The War of the Secret Agents and Other Poems" (Scribner, 1965), was greeted with acclaim and won the Lamont Poetry Prize. His second collection, "The Family Goldschmitt" (Scribner, 1971), seems to have received little attention, and it has been reported that much of the print run was accidentally pulped. He did not publish another book during his life, but had been organizing a volume when he died. Of these later poems, Tad Richards has written, "Though only in his fifties, he surveys the territory of death, particularly in the near-perfect 'Petition,' an elegy for his cat, with a concreteness he did not often find in life." Two of Coulette's poems, "Night Thoughts" and "Postscript", were included in the 2003 anthology, "California Poetry: From the Gold Rush to the Present"; the editors write that "Coulette melded seamless metrics with a lifelong devotion to California icons like the LBG-30 (a Glendale computer), the noir Los Angeles memorialized by Raymond Chandler, and the gravesites of Hollywood movie stars."
Coulette was born in Los Angeles, California, and earned a bachelor's degree in 1952 from Los Angeles State College, now known as California State University, Los Angeles. He studied at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, after which he returned to California. He spent nearly his entire career as a faculty member at California State University, Los Angeles. After Coulette's death (in South Pasadena, California, at 60), the poets Donald Justice and Robert Mezey edited and published Coulette's collected poetry. The collection included a wealth of unpublished poems, and was published in 1990 by the University of Arkansas Press.

Virginia State Route 55

State Route 55 (SR 55) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. Known for most of its length as John Marshall Highway, the state highway runs from the West Virginia state line, where the highway continues as West Virginia Route 55 (WV 55), east to U.S. Route 29 (US 29) in Gainesville. West of its interchange with Interstate 81 (I-81) in Strasburg, SR 55 runs concurrently with the easternmost portion of US 48 as part of Corridor H. East of Front Royal, the state highway serves as the local complement of I-66 as it passes through the towns of Marshall, The Plains, and Haymarket.
Most of SR 55 is a Virginia Byway.
Route description.
SR 55 begins at the West Virginia state line at the highway's summit of Great North Mountain. The highway continues west toward Wardensville as US 48 and WV 55. SR 55 heads northeast as two-lane undivided Wardensville Pike through George Washington National Forest and descends the mountain to the hamlet of Star Tannery, where the highway leaves Frederick County by crossing Cedar Creek. The state highway, now named John Marshall Highway, passes around the northern end of Little North Mountain near the community of Wheatfield, where the highway turns south. SR 55 passes through the Shenandoah County communities of Lebanon Church and Clary on its way to a diamond interchange with I-81, which serves as US 48's eastern terminus. SR 55 continues south into the town of Strasburg, where the highway has a short concurrency with US 11 on Massanutten Street and passes under Norfolk Southern Railway's B-Line, which it crosses several more times due to the B-Line’s similar route, ending in Manassas. In the center of the town, US 11 and SR 55 head west and east, respectively, on King Street. The state highway passes under the B-Line again before reaching the eastern edge of town, where the highway becomes Front Royal Road and makes a curve to the south. SR 55 passes through an S-curve as it crosses the North Fork Shenandoah River into Warren County.
Just north of Signal Knob, the northernmost peak of Massanutten Mountain, SR 55 passes to the south side of the B-Line. The highway, now named Strasburg Road, crosses Passage Creek on its way to the Riverton area of the town of Front Royal at the confluence of the North Fork and South Fork Shenandoah River to form the Shenandoah River. In Riverton, SR 55 turns south onto Shenandoah Avenue and joins US 340 and US 522 in a triple concurrency. The four-lane undivided highway crosses the South Fork and passes through a pair of right-angle curves onto 14th Street and then Royal Avenue. Just north of downtown Front Royal, US 522 turns southeast onto Commerce Street; SR 55 and US 340 continue south as a two-lane undivided street through downtown. At the southern end of the town, US 340 continues south while the state highway turns east onto four-lane undivided South Street, gaining a center left-turn lane further east. East of US 522, SR 55 reduces to two lanes and leaves the town of Front Royal as John Marshall Highway. The state highway passes under the B-Line just before its junction with SR 79 (Apple Mountain Road), a very short connector with I-66. SR 55, I-66, and the B-Line follow Manassas Run to the community of Linden, where the thoroughfares intersect the Appalachian Trail, cross Blue Ridge Mountain at Manassas Gap, and enter Fauquier County.
SR 55 continues to parallel I-66 and the B-Line through the valley of Goose Creek, where they pass through Markham. The two highways leave Goose Creek and the B-Line west of Delaplane, where SR 55 veers away from I-66 temporarily and joins US 17 (Winchester Road) in a concurrency before the two highways merge onto I-66 near Oak Hill, the country estate of John Marshall. The highways are directly paralleled on the north by the highway's old alignment, Grove Lane. Just west of the town of Marshall, SR 55 exits I-66 at a diamond interchange onto Free State Road. SR 55, which is concurrent with US 17 Business, turns east onto Main Street at Grove Lane. In the center of town, US 17 Business heads south on Winchester Road opposite SR 710 (Rectortown Road) while SR 55 continues east on Main Street, which intersects the B-Line before leaving town. SR 55 continues east and becomes the Main Street of the town of The Plains, where the highway meets the B-Line at another grade crossing and intersects the northern end of SR 245 (Old Tavern Road). SR 55, I-66, and the B-Line follow Broad Run through the Bull Run Mountains at Thoroughfare Gap into Prince William County.
SR 55 crosses the B-Line again at the hamlet of Thoroughfare. The state highway intersects US 15 (James Madison Highway) just west of the town of Haymarket; in that town the highway is known as Washington Street. SR 55 continues southeast to Gainesville, where the highway reaches its eastern terminus. As of June 2011 
SR 55 has been re-routed over the old Gallerher Road, and is now called John Marshall Highway. The US 29–SR 55 junction is the focus of a long-term project to provide grade separations between the B-Line (the last crossing by SR 55) and both the John Marshall Highway and US 29, and to construct an interchange between US 29, SR 55, and SR 619 (Linton Hall Road). The single-point urban interchange was completed in 2015.

Automatic stay

In United States bankruptcy law, an automatic stay is an automatic injunction that halts actions by creditors, with certain exceptions, to collect debts from a debtor who has declared bankruptcy. Under section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, the stay begins at the moment the bankruptcy petition is filed. Secured creditors may, however, petition the bankruptcy court for relief from the automatic stay upon a showing of cause.
Provisions.
A filed bankruptcy petition immediately operates as an automatic stay, holding in abeyance various forms of creditor action against the debtor. Automatic stay provisions work to protect the debtor against certain actions from the creditor, including: 
A court may give a creditor relief from the stay if the creditor can show that the stay does not give the creditor "adequate protection" or if it jeopardizes the creditor's interest in certain property. The court may give relief to the creditor in the form of periodic cash payments or an additional or replacement lien on the property.
Concerned that debtors may exploit some of the advantages of automatic stay provisions, the United States Congress in 1994 provided some relief to certain creditors, such as creditors having a secured interest in a single real estate asset. Congress required that debtors in this situation either file a plan that has a reasonable chance of being accepted within a reasonable amount of time, or make monthly payments to each such secured creditor in the amount equal to interest at a current fair market rate on the value of the creditor's real estate.
In 2005, Congress added two more exceptions to the automatic stay provisions. These exceptions concern landlords seeking to evict tenants. First, any eviction proceedings in which the landlord obtained a judgment of possession "prior" to the filing of the bankruptcy petition may be continued. Second, eviction proceedings filed after bankruptcy proceedings are exempt if the proceeding involves evicting the tenant on the basis of using illegal substances or "endangerment" of the property.
Pursuant to the new provisions of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, certain restrictions were added to section 362. If the debtor had a case dismissed in a case pending during the year before the bankruptcy case was filed, the automatic stay will expire as to the debtor and possibly as to the estate unless the debtor obtains an order extending it within 30 days. If the debtor had two cases pending in the year prior to filing, the automatic stay does not go into effect unless the debtor files a motion.

John Beresford, 8th Marquess of Waterford

John Hubert de la Poer Beresford, 8th Marquess of Waterford (14 July 1933 – 11 February 2015) was an Irish peer. He succeeded to the marquessate in 1934. He was educated at Eton, and later served as a lieutenant in the Royal Horse Guards' Supplementary Reserve.
Biography.
A highly skilled horseman, Lord Waterford rode the first of his many point-to-point winners while still at Eton, and he went on to become the youngest-ever member of the Irish Turf Club. From 1960 to 1985, he was captain of the All-Ireland Polo Club and its highest handicap player. For 12 years (1960–72) he was a member, at both medium and high-goal levels, of the Duke of Edinburgh's Windsor Park team, which won the British open championship for the Cowdray Park Gold Cup twice, and on another occasion the high-goal Warwickshire Cup.
After retiring from the Army, Lord Waterford returned to Curraghmore and became director of a number of enterprises to provide local employment, among them the Munster Chipboard company, Waterford Properties (a hotel group) and, later, Kenmare Resources, an Irish oil and gas exploration company. He was a founder patron of the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera.
He died on 11 February 2015 at the age of 81 and was succeeded by his son, Henry Beresford (b. 1958).
Family.
In 1957 he married Lady Caroline Olein Geraldine Wyndham-Quin, daughter of the 6th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl. The couple had three sons and a daughter:
His family seats were Curraghmore, Portlaw, County Waterford, and Glenbridge Lodge, Valleymount, County Wicklow.

Norske Skog Saugbrugs

Norske Skog Saugbrugs AS is a pulp mill and paper mill located in Halden, Norway, which produces supercalender (SC) magazine paper. Located in the river Tista in Tistedalen, the mill produces 550,000 tonnes per year in three paper machines. Pulp is produced both from virgin fibers at an on-site thermomechanical pulp (TMP) mill. Part of Norske Skog, it is the sole remaining magazine mill in Norway.
Established as Saugbrugsforeningen in 1859, the company consolidated the sawmill operations along Tista, demolishing them and building a new sawmill. Pulp production was established in 1889. A major revamp from 1907 to 1910 saw the construction of Tistedalsfossen Power Station and pulp production based on the sulfite process. The company was involved in a wide range of wood processing industries, buying several smaller mills in the area.
The first two paper machines (PM1 and PM2) opened in 1914 and 1915. Viscose production was introduced along with PM3 in 1929. The mill underwent a gradual modernization through the 1950s, resulting in the opening of PM4 in 1963 and PM5 in 1968. From the mid 1970s through the early 1990s the mill cut most of its pollutants which had severely polluted Iddefjord and Tista. This coincided with a cut in most manufacturing not related to magazine paper. Norske Skog bought the mill in 1989 and opened PM6 in 1993. The mill's forests and three hydroelectric power stations were sold in 2001 and 2002.
History.
Establishment and early years.
Sawmill operation to exploit the fall in Tistedalsfossen has been conducted since the 16th century. In addition to the hydropower, the site was located at the mouth of Haldenvassdraget. Soon there were more than thirty sawmills and the site was incorporated as a town in 1665 and named Fredrikshald, later changed to Halden.
The system of privileges for sawmills was abandoned from 1 January 1860, at which time any citizen was free to establish and operate these. This caused eleven sawmill owners, with more than a combined thirty sawmills, to establish a joint operating company, Saugbrugsforeningen, in 1859. The company was capitalized through the issuing of shares worth 750,000 Norwegian speciedaler, and consisted of all the sawmills along Tistedalselva.
The company was in effect controlled and run by three families—Anker, Stang and Wiel—which were also heavily invested in the town's shipping. All directors in the company until 1909 were members of said families.
The goal of the new company was to rationalize the operation. All the former mills were demolished and a new facility was constructed. A major concern was the construction of the Kongsvinger Line, which would make it easier for forest owners in Aurskog, Nes and Vinger and to instead sell their lumber to Kristiania (Oslo). By cutting operating costs at the mills, the investors hoped to compensate for the reduced transport costs by railway. The new mill was situated on the south side of the river, on the lot Kjøbmandsdalen. At the time the new mill opened it had about 100 employees.
Mechanical saws were introduced in the early 1867, when the first steam-powered saw was installed. A carpenter shop opened in 1875, predominantly producing doors and windows. Through the 1870s the company ran with high margins and invested a substantial part of this in forest estates. The mill was expanded several times, and by 1883 it had eight production lines and 445 employees. This was in part due to major exports to Australia starting in the 1880s. The carpenter shop was destroyed in a fire in 1897 and never rebuilt.
Pulp, electricity and paper.
The first pulp mill along Tistaelva was Søndre Skåningsfossen Træsliberi, established by Christian Anker in 1867. This operated profitably and was able to capitalize on much of the otherwise low-value refuse from the sawmills. Saugsbrugforeningen started considering the possibility of building its own pulp mill in 1872. Declining pulp prices from 1874 caused the company to shelve the plans for the meantime. The mechanical pulp mill opened in 1889 with five grinders and annual production of 11,000 tonnes, employing sixty people. The pulp mill was the company's until then largest investment, financed through a loan of 1.25 million Norwegian krone.
By the 1900s the company had challenges making ends meet. The company therefore in 1905 initiated a program to totally revamp its operations. The three head saw mills were demolished and replaced with a new, steam-powered head saw mill adjacent to the edger mill. The pulp mill was expanded to handle 15,000 tones annually, powered by the new Tistedalsfossen Power Station. Finally a new chemical pulp mill was to be built at Kaken. A complicating factor for the power station was that the company only owned about two-thirds of the waterfall rights. Finally the Tista Canal was built, allowing direct access from Kaken to the port.
The power station was completed in 1907, and the following year the sulfite process chemical pulp mill was completed the following year. All the upgrades were finalized in 1910, having cost NOK 4.1 million—twice the budget. A particular contributor was the pulp mill, which had cost NOK 3 million. Conservatism within management and owners led the company to not even discuss if a loan would be an appropriate way of funding the investments. Instead, of productive forest in Sweden was sold to Borregaard for NOK 4.7 million.
The pulp mill came off on a poor start, with declining pulp prices. Most of the pulp was exported and director Henry Melhuus therefore proposed that Saugbrugsforeningen establish a paper mill. He hoped to reduce the volatility in revenue and that the company would do better in poor times. This resulted in a plan for a paper mill with two paper machines with a combined capacity of 10,000 tonnes, a new electrical pulp mill with an annual capacity of 12,000 tonnes, an expansion of the chemical pulp mill and an expansion of the power station. Total investments were NOK 4 million.
The plans were approved in January 1912. Most of the work was completed in 1915, when the first paper machine, PM1, was concluded. PM2 opened the following year. It was the first-largest paper mill in Norway, with most of the output being exported to the United Kingdom. The company bought Ørje Bruk in 1913, which operated a 9,000-tonne pulp mill. It was bought predominantly to secure its hydroelectric rights.
Interwar period.
The price of pulp doubled during the First World War, but so did many of the costs, including a 250 percent increase in wages. By 1917 export of sawed wood was responsible for forty percent of its revenue. The company experienced high profits during the war, peaking at NOK 5.6 million in 1918. However, the investments and increasing prices caused two issues of new shares, both of NOK 6 million in 1916 and 1918, raising the share equity to NOK 18 million. Demand and prices skyrocketed from 1919, but Saugbrugsforeningen, like many of its competitors, failed to capitalized due to the corresponding rise in lumber prices.
Sales prices dropped again from 1921, and the company had a deficit of NOK 6 million that year. The rest of the 1920s remained difficult period for the company, with low margins and highly fluctuating but steadily falling export. Ankers Træsliperi &amp; Paperifabrik was bought in 1924 and expanded the following year to an annual production of 16,000 tonnes of pulp and 10,000 tonnes of newsprint.
Saugbrugsforeningen ran trial production of viscose in 1922. This led to the approving of a 7,000 tonne mill in 1928. It was built at the same time as the 3,000-tonne PM3. Both began production in 1929, after an investment of NOK 2 million. 1931 was dominated by a major strike from 8 April to 11 September and the annual production was halved.
The head saw mill was closed in 1931, but the edger mill was kept and refined coarse-cut wood from other mills in the area. Viscose became gradually more important; it was responsible for 30 percent of production in 1930 and 57 percent in 1937. Newsprint production was cut out and the remaining production move to finer grades of paper. The company also established production facilities for wood engraving and pressure treating. The 1930s were generally good times for the company, with a steady increase in prices. Then the bottom fell out the market in 1938, resulting in NOK 2 million in losses.
During the Second World War, from 1940 to 1945, the authorities required the mill to shift its pulp production to feed. The entire country lacked fossil fuels, causing electric boilers to be installed to produce steam for the paper machines. Forestry was reduced as fuels ran short, causing the mill to run out of fibers. The mills were run down by 1945, and production did not reach pre-war levels until 1950.
PM4 and PM5.
A major upgrade to the plant took place in the period after 1950, following General Director O. T. Jarlsby's ten-year plan. Production was eased throughout the period by increased access to lumber and higher demand. The Anker Mill was rebuilt to produce paperboard. A new lumber cleaning mill opened in 1951, followed by a new central furnace the following year, a pyrite roaster and lumber chopper in 1953 and a new beater in 1954. Tistedalsfoss II Power Station and a spirit factory with an annual production of opened in 1955. A hydrocyclone facility for the sulfite pulp mill, new 10,000 tonne oil tanks and a calcium carbonate management facility for the paper mill were taken into use two years later. A new warehouse was completed in 1958 and the bleaching site expanded the year after. The ten-year plan ended with the expansion of the conditioning facility for the paper mill and expansion of the sulfite pulp mill in 1960. In addition a series of minor upgrades and modernizations were carried out throughout the 1950s, such as extending the paper machines. From 1956 operations ran around-the-clock.
Meanwhile, there was an modernization of the upstream logistics. A breakthrough occurred when it was established that lumber did not have to be air-dried for two years before being made to pulp, freeing up a storage site at Veden which had stored up to one million logs. Trucks were introduced in transport and hundreds of kilometers (hundreds of miles) of lumber roads were built to ease extraction. For instance they were used to truck lumber from Store Le to Øymarkasjøen, thus closing the Otteeid Canal. Increased lumber demand was covered through procurement from Värmland and the Glomma watershed. Log driving was eliminated on tributaries and limited to the main course of Haldenvassdraget.
The company decided in 1960 to increase its paper production dramatically. PM4 started operations in 1963 in a fully integrated production line manufacturing supercalender magazine paper, with an annual production of 50,000 tonnes. This involved the installation of a new lumber cleaning and chopping mill, a new pulp mill, a new boiler system and a new water pipe from Femsjøen. Steam from the Halden Reactor was used in the paper machines. Saugbrugsforeningen thus became the first paper mill in the world to derive steam from nuclear power. Investments from 1958 to 1963 cost NOK 165 million. By 1964 the company was producing 130,000 tonnes annually of various paper grades, up four-fold since 1950. The company had 3,000 employees, of which about 1,000 worked in the forests.
During the planning of PM4 there had been considered building a fifth paper machine, and a lot was reserved for the machine. After PM4 was operational, management decided to go for further expansion. PM5 was built by Wärtsilä and became operational in July 1968. It had an annual production of 70,000 tonnes and initially operated at per second. Investments were about NOK 100 million. PM4 and PM5 were by far the largest paper machines in Norway until the 1966 opening of Norske Skog Skogn. PM1 was converted to produce fine grade paper based on pulp from birch and spruce. By 1970 the factory's output reached 220,000 tonnes annually.
PM2 and PM3 were taken out of service in 1977 and 1980, respectively.
Environmental issues.
The first major environmental concern was air pollution, with Halden experiencing the highest sulfur oxide content of any Norwegian town. The sulfite pulp used limestone, which made it impossible to capture the sulfur oxide. This was mitigated in 1978, when the pulp mill was rebuilt to instead use magnesium.
Until the 1970s Saugbrugsforeningen emitted all its production wastes into the river Tista without any form of cleaning. Tista drains into Iddefjord, which is narrow and has a threshold at its mouth, severely limiting the flow of water into Skagerrak. A 1975 survey concluded that the fjord was biologically dead—its oxygen content so low that life could not be sustained.
With new regulations in place in 1975, Saugbrugsforeningen initiated a process to reduce its emissions. NOK 212 million were invested between 1975 and 1978, involving a collection system for sulfite waste, a new chemical treatment plant, two external sedimentation pools and two electric boilers. By 1980 the situation in Iddefjorden had improved, but by 1985 the improvements had stagnated and further measures were required.
After the first half of the 1970s gave high prices, the company experienced low prices during the latter part of the decade. Meanwhile, it was a severely unmodern mill, oftentimes employing archaic and inefficient production processes. Per Ethold was hired as chief executive officer in 1977 and started the process of modernizing the mill. By 1981 all auxiliary production mills were closed, including fine-grade paper, sulfite pulp and sawed wood. This led to major layoffs and demonstrations by the labor unions.
A second wave of environmental investments started in 1986. A treatment plant for the bark water was completed in 1986 and a central cleaning plant for debarking of the lumber the following year. In 1988 the sedimentary pool was rebuilt and a treatment plant for the smoke from the bark burning was completed. Bleaching with chlorine was replaced with hydrogen peroxide and sodium dithionite in 1989. This was largely done during a period when most customers demanded the removal of chlorine in products. This demand has since recessed. These investments cost a combined NOK 40 million.
A further NOK 36 million were invested in 1990 and 1991, reducing water consumption, fiber emissions, and smoke emissions. A precipitation process was introduced in the sedimentary process. NOK 202 million was invested in a four-stage biological treatment plant completed in 1992. This produces biogas and sludge, which were burned and used for heating. The most important factor was the closing of the sulfate mill in 1991, which cut most of the pollution to water. By 1995 emissions had been reduced sufficient to reestablish ordinary biological activities in the fjord. NOK 180 million was invested in a bio boiler in 1996.
Kosmos and Norske Skog.
The 1970s and 1980s saw a modernization of the forestry. The number of lumberjacks in the mill's of forest had dropped to fifty and the work largely carried out using harvesters. The last log driving took place in 1982—better roads and cumbersome operations due to the number of locks made trucks more profitable. Increased production led to need for more lumber, but import from Sweden was reduced with the increased Swedish industry. Saugbrugsforeningen was therefore forced to import from further afield, including Denmark, Poland, Germany and for periods also from Canada, Russia and the Baltic.
The company approved a five-year investment plan in 1980, costing NOK 500 million. Both PM4 and PM5 were to be modernized and received computer-based controlling systems. Low prices caused the plans to be postponed after PM5 was completed in 1981. The conglomerate Kosmos bought Saugbrugsforeningen in 1983, paying about NOK 100 million for the company. Both prior and afterwards there was discussion of Saugbrugsforeningen joining a major paper production group. PM4 was upgraded in 1986 and 1987, costing NOK 296 million.
Kosmos considered selling Saugbrugsforeningen in 1985, and annually contacted various potential purchasers. The two major players were Orkla–Borregaard and Norske Skog. The former operated the Borregaard mill in the neighboring town of Sarpsborg. Norske Skog had bought a substantial portion of what became Norske Skog Follum from Orkla–Borregaard in 1985, under the gentleman's agreement that they would avoid entering the Østfold market. Borregaard owned major forest areas close to Saugbrugsforeningen's and the latter aimed to achieve synergies both in regard to logistics and operation of the forest estates.
Kosmos collapsed in 1988 and was taken over by I. M. Skaugen. They aimed at divesting the diversified portfolio in the company in the aim of restructuring Kosmos as a pure shipping company, and placed Saugbrugsforeningen and other assets up for sale. Noegotiations for a sale to Norske Skog commenced on 12 January 1989. The company was valuated at NOK 1.8 billion, although a purchaser also had to carry out the plans for a new paper machine, estimated to cost NOK 3 billion. An important strategic consideration for Norske Skog was that it did not have any production of magazine paper, something the inclusion of Saugbrugsforeningen's production line would allow for. The take-over was approved by the purchaser on 9 November 1989 and effectuated on 1 December. The decision included approval of a new paper machine. Saugbrugsforeningen changed its name to Norske Skog Saugbrugs. Norske Skog paid NOK 460 million in cash and took over NOK 980 million in debt. The remaining NOK 360 million was financed through issuing new shares. Kosmos thus received NOK 820 million from their NOK 100 million investment six years earlier.
Norske Skog's board decided in December 1990 to close the sulfite pulp mill and build a new magazine paper machine, PM6. The decision to terminate cellulose production was both caused by the environmental impact as well as by a steady diminishing demand for chemical pulp. The recession following the dissolution of the Soviet Union meant that exports to Eastern Europe were decimated. Meanwhile, new production technologies for paper had less demand for cellulose. The closing resulted in a loss of 210 jobs, of which 25 were transferred to PM6 and 50 were retired early. Construction of the new mill took place at Skakkestad, to the northeast of the main facility. Originally PM6 was proposed to produce light weight coated paper, but after Stora bought the technological partner Feldmühle, PM6 had to revert to supercalender.
The rinser, chipping module and the thermomechanical pulp mill opened in January 1992. Installation of the paper machine started in July; at the most 1,150 people worked on the project as a whole. Built by Valmet, PM6 started operating on 7 February 1993. By 1995 PM6 set a world record of per minute and the mill as a whole produced 523,000 tonnes and had a profit of NOK 700 million. Saugbrugsforeningen merged with Norske Skog from 1 January 1996, becoming a business unit named Norske Skog Saugbrugs.
Norske Skog sold the forest properties previously owned by Saugbrugs in November 2001 to the Norwegian Forest Owners Association for NOK 200 million. A year later the power stations formerly under Saugbrugs' control were sold to Akershus Energi.

William Anthony Granville

William Anthony Granville (December 16, 1863 – February 4, 1943) was an American mathematician, and served as president of Gettysburg College from 1910 until 1923.
Early life.
William Anthony Granville was born on December 16, 1863, in White Rock, Minnesota, to Hannah (née Olson) and T. Pearson Granville. He was of Swedish heritage. He attended Gustavus Adolphus College and the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale College. In 1893 he was awarded a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Yale. In 1897, he graduated from Yale with a Doctor of Philosophy. He studied under James Pierpont and his dissertation was titled, "Referat on the Origin and Development of the Addition-Theorem in Elliptic Functions". He later graduated from Lafayette College with a Doctor of Laws in 1911. He also attended Muhlenberg College.
Career.
Granville began his teaching career at Bethany College, where he was an instructor of mathematics and served as the college treasurer. He was acting president of Bethany College. He was professor of mathematics at Yale from 1895 to 1910. He then served as president of Gettysburg College from October 1910 to 1923. During his tenure as president, he is credited with removing the school's existing debt and establishing an endowment fund. The faculty numbers were increased and the Student Christian association building, the academy building (later Huber Hall) and Weidensall Hall were erected. The department of engineering was established, which remained until 1939. The summer school was established and the entrance requirements of students was raised. During World War I at the college, he organized a department of military science and tactics and established ROTC at the school. He was also president of the American Federation of Lutheran Brotherhoods from 1925 to 1929. He wrote textbooks on differential and integral calculus, plane and spherical trigonometry and mathematical analysis. He was a member of the American Mathematical Society, Sigma Chi and the American Society of Swedish Engineers.
In 1918, Granville was a member of the executive committee of the Churches of Christ. He became affiliated with the Washington National Insurance Company of Evanston, Illinois, on March 1, 1923. He became vice president and director and served in those roles until his death. He also wrote accident and health insurance manuals.
Personal life.
Granville married Ida Irwin of McPherson, Kansas. They had two daughters, Rachel and Mrs. S. F. Lehman.

Fried spider

Fried spider is a regional snack in Cambodia. In the Cambodian town of Skuon, Cheung Prey, Kampong Cham, the vending of fried spiders as a specialty snack is a popular attraction for tourists. Spiders are also available elsewhere in Cambodiain Phnom Penh for instancebut Skuon, a market town on the highway from the capital, is the centre of their popularity. The spiders are bred in holes in the ground in villages north of Skuon, or foraged for in nearby forestland, and fried in oil. It is not clear how this practice started, but some have suggested that the population might have started eating spiders out of desperation during the years of Khmer Rouge rule, when food was in short supply. 
The spiders are a species of tarantula called "a-ping" in Khmer, and are about the size of a human palm. The snacks cost about 300 riel each in 2002, or about One travel book identifies them as "Haplopelma albostriatum", known colloquially as the Thailand zebra leg tarantula, and notes that the same species' common name has been the "edible spider" for more than a hundred years. The popularity of the dish is, however, a recent phenomenon, starting perhaps as late as the 1990s. The same book details a recipe: the spiders are tossed in a mixture of MSG, sugar, and salt; crushed garlic is fried in oil until fragrant, then the spiders are added and fried alongside the garlic until "the legs are almost completely stiff, by which time the contents of the abdomen are not so runny." 
The taste has been described as bland, "rather like a cross between chicken and cod", with a contrast in texture from a crispy exterior to a soft centre. The legs contain little flesh, while the head and thorax have "a delicate white meat inside". The abdomen is often not consumed, however, as it contains a brown paste consisting of organs, possibly eggs, and excrement. Some people call it a delicacy while others recommend not eating it.
In Mexico, tarantulas have been offered in tacos, with a serving of guacamole. However, Mexican law forbids the sale of many species of tarantula for human consumption, and vendors offering this item have been shut down by the authorities.

Lapdance (song)

"Lapdance" is a song by American rock and hip-hop band N.E.R.D. from their debut studio album, "In Search of..." The song features rappers Lee Harvey and Vita, and was produced by the Neptunes. The song compares politicians to strippers giving a lap dance for free, due to the use of their excessive propaganda without ever taking action.
It was ranked number 93 on VH1's "100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop".
A remix of "Lapdance" by Trent Reznor appeared on the compilation album "Spin This". Although it is censored, an uncensored version of the remix is available on a rare promo single disc. A remix of "Lapdance" by Paul Oakenfold appeared on the soundtrack album "Swordfish". In 2020, the UK band Wargasm released a cover of the single.

Danza de los Voladores

The Danza de los Voladores (; "Dance of the Flyers"), or Palo Volador (; "flying pole"), is an ancient Mesoamerican ceremony/ritual still performed today, albeit in modified form, in isolated pockets in Mexico. It is believed to have originated with the Nahua, Huastec and Otomi peoples in central Mexico, and then spread throughout most of Mesoamerica. The ritual consists of dance and the climbing of a pole from which four of the five participants then launch themselves tied with ropes to descend to the ground. The fifth remains on top of the pole, dancing and playing a flute and drum. According to one myth, the ritual was created to ask the gods to end a severe drought. Although the ritual did not originate with the Totonac people, today it is strongly associated with them, especially those in and around Papantla in the Mexican state of Veracruz. The ceremony was named an Intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO in order to help the ritual survive and thrive in the modern world. The Aztecs believed that Danza de los Voladores was the symbol of their culture.
History.
According to Totonac myth, at least 450 years ago there was a severe drought that brought hunger to the people. The gods were withholding the rain because the people had neglected them. The ceremony was created, to appease the gods and bring back the rains. In some versions of the story, the ritual is created by the old men of a village, who then chose five young men who were chaste. In other versions, the five men themselves create the ritual. The tallest tree in the nearby forest is cut down, with the permission of the mountain god, stripped of branches and dragged to the village. The trunk is erected with much ceremony. The youths climb the pole and four jump off while the fifth played music. The ritual pleased the rain god Tlaloc and other gods, so the rains began again and the fertility of the earth returned.
The exact origin of this ritual/dance is unknown, but it is thought to have originated with the Huastec, Nahua and Otomi peoples in Sierra de Puebla and mountain areas of Veracruz. The ritual spread through much of the Mesoamerican world until it was practiced from northern Mexico to Nicaragua. Evidence for the ritual stretches back at least as far as the pre-Classic period according to ceramics found in Nayarit. In pre-Hispanic times, the ritual was far more complex, involving taboos and meditation. The participants were thought to impersonate birds and in some areas were dressed as parrots, macaws, quetzals and eagles. These birds represented the gods of the earth, air, fire, and water. By the 16th century, the ritual was strongly associated with solar ceremonies, such as the spring equinox. The ritual is most closely tied with rain and solar deities such as Xipe Totec and Tlazolteotl.
In Maya mythology the creation of the world is associated with a bird deity (Itzamna) residing at the World Tree (the center of the world). Five "birdmen" at the top of a pole represent bird deities. The main dancer stands in the center and plays a flute, which represents the sound of birds singing. The four other "birdmen" (representing the four directions) spin around the pole to represent the recreation of the world (and the regeneration of life) In the early form, instead of only five men there are six men dressed as birds with each member climbing on top and performing a dance and at the end tied ropes around their waist and who all jump in unison and descend downwards. Many villages in Mexico banned this version of the practice due to injuries and even death.
Diego Durán, who recorded many Aztec customs at the time of the Spanish conquest, described an incident reminiscent of the Danza de los Voladores, where an Aztec prince, Ezhuahuacatl, sacrificed himself by diving from a pole 20 "brazas" high (probably about 120 feet, a "braza" being roughly a fathom, i.e. c. 6 feet). The four modern day voladores typically circle the pole 13 times each, for a total of 52 circuits, or the number of years in the Aztec "calendar round".
The ritual was partially lost after the Conquest, and the Spaniards destroyed many records about it, though Juan de Torquemada preserved a remarkably detailed account. The Church was much against "pagan" rituals such as these after the Conquest and this and many other rituals were silenced or practiced in secret. Much of what is known is due to oral tradition and writing by the first Europeans to come to Mexico. Later, Catholic elements would be added to the ritual, and it became something of a spectacle in the later colonial period. The ritual mostly disappeared in Mexico and Central America with small remnants surviving, including the Totonac people.
Although the ritual did not originate with the Totonacs, today it is often associated with the Totonacs of the Papantla area in Veracruz. In modern times, a number of changes have occurred. Due to the deforestation of much of the Sierra de Puebla and mountain areas of Veracruz, most voladores perform on permanent metal poles, which in Veracruz are often donated by the oil industry. The most controversial change has been the induction of women to perform the ceremony. Traditionally, it has been taboo to allow women to become voladores but a few have become such, all of whom are in Puebla state. One of the first males to train women, Jesús Arroyo Cerón, died when he fell from a pole during the Cumbre Tajín 2006 cultural festival. The elders of the Totonacs believe this was divine retribution and still prohibit the performance of the ritual to women participants.
Versions.
In addition to whether or not there is a pole ceremony, other variations in the ritual exist. Among the Nahua and Otomi peoples, there is generally no dance before climbing the pole; the ceremony begins at the top. There is also a version where the suspended frame has five sides instead of four and the ritual involves six dancers and not five. The most traditional time to perform this version is on Holy Thursday at the culmination of a festival held on this day called the Huapangueada. Some dancers have rules to follow such as needing to fast for one or more days before the ceremony and abstain from sexual relations so that the gods will look upon the ceremony favorably. Most of the variations are found in Puebla state.
However, the most controversial variation is whether or not to permit women to perform the ritual. In Papantla, which is the community most closely associated with the ritual, the Consejo de Ancianos Totonacas (Council of Totonac Elders) has formally prohibited the inclusion of women. Traditionally, women have been excluded from all Totonac ritual dancing. Even for the dance called La Maringuilla, the female protagonist is portrayed by a man. The prohibition stems from the belief that women are “bad entities, who bring bad luck” and their inclusion would be a sin and/or anger the gods.
However, in a few communities, such as Cuetzalan and Pahuatlán in Puebla and Zozocolco de Hidalgo in Veracruz, women have been allowed to be voladores. Those who are allowed to take part must first complete a series of rituals designed to ask the forgiveness of the gods and Catholic saints for being a woman. The women must also be virgins without a boyfriend if unmarried or abstain from sexual relations before the ritual if married. If a female volador is found to have broken the rules of sexual abstention, she is taken to an altar which is surrounded by incense burners and candles. An image of the Archangel Michael or Saint James bears witness to the punishment, which involves a number of slaps to the face (bofetadas), with the quantity depending on the transgression and the decision of those in charge. It is claimed that the ritual cures “the fever” of the woman. It is believed that women who do not obey these rules will bring calamity to the ritual.
It is not known when the first female was allowed to take part as a volador. One of the first men to train women was Jesús Arroyo Ceron, who trained his daughter Isabel in 1972; after this, he trained his other three daughters. In March 2006, aged 70, he fell from a pole during the Cumbre Tajín celebrations and died. Family members believe he fell “at the side of the gods,” but many patriarchs believe the accident was divine retribution. A wooden cross and flowers at the Plaza del Volador in Parke Takilhsukut memorialize him. Approximately twenty female voladores are known to exist.
In Guatemala the flying pole dance, called "Palo volador", is still celebrated in Joyabaj (15 August), Chichicastenango (17–23 January) and Cubulco (26 July).
Totonac version.
According to Totonac myth, the gods told men, “Dance, and we shall observe.” Today, pleasing the gods of old is still a part of the most traditional version of the ritual. The Totonac dress for this ritual consists of red pants with a white shirt, a cloth across the chest and a cap. The pants, hat and chest cloth are heavily embroidered and otherwise decorated. The cloth across the chest symbolized blood. The hat is adorned with flowers for fertility; mirrors represent the sun and from the top stream multicolored ribbons representing the rainbow. These costumes are made by the voladores themselves and can cost between 5,000 and 8,000 pesos each.
The most traditional and lengthy version starts from the selection and cutting of the tree to be used, to the final dance after all voladores have descended from the pole. The tree selection, cutting and erecting ceremony is called the tsakáe kiki. It involves going into the forest to find a suitable tree and asking the permission or the pardon of the mountain god Quihuicolo for taking it. The tree is stripped of its branches and dragged to the ceremonial site, where a hole has been dug for the now-30-meter pole. Before erecting the pole, offerings of flowers, copal, alcohol, candles and live chickens or a live turkey are placed in the hole. These are then crushed as the pole is erected, adding to the fertility of the earth. The pole becomes a connection point between the sky and the earth and the underworld with the surface world, a representation of the world tree, and considered to be the fifth cardinal direction of the earth. The post and the dancers are then purified with alcohol sprinkled in the form of a cross and tobacco smoke.
In most cases, however, the pole used is a permanently placed one, often of steel, and this part of the ceremony does not take place. On these occasions, the ceremony begins with a dance and song type called a “son.” Usually the initial song played and danced to is called the “son of forgiveness.” After this, the five begin to climb the pole with the chief or “caporal” going first. The caporal will not descend but rather will stay at the top of the pole until near the end of the ceremony. The caporal stands on a capstan, called a manzana (apple) which is a small platform at the top of the pole. From this capstan is suspended a square frame called a cuadro (square) on which the other four voladores sit. While these four wind the ropes around the pole and tie themselves to the ends, the caporal plays the flute and drum acknowledging the four cardinal directions, beginning with the east because it is believed life came from this direction. The four ropes are each wound thirteen times for a total of fifty-two, the number of years in a Mesoamerican great year. The caporal then bends fully backwards to acknowledge the sun, playing all the while.
The four voladores represent the four cardinal directions as well as the four elements: earth, air, fire and water. The caporal represents the fifth sun. The four voladores seated on the cuadro face the caporal and at the appropriate moment fall backwards to descend to the ground suspended by the wound ropes. As the ropes unwind, the voladores spin, creating a moving pyramid shape. As the other voladores descend, the caporal plays the “son of goodbye” and dances on the narrow platform. Traditionally, after the descent, there is another dance of goodbye.
Intangible Cultural Heritage and conservation of the tradition.
The Ritual Ceremony of the Voladores of Papantla was recognized as Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) by UNESCO in 2009. This is the second Mexican event to be so recognized, with the first being the Indigenous Festivity of the Dead in 2008. Governor Fidel Herrera Beltrán received the award in the name of the people and the government of Veracruz, and especially the indigenous people of the Totonacapan region of the state. Celebrations of the recognition took place on October 12, 2009, in Takilhsukut Park at El Tajín and other volador sites in Mexico. The ritual was inscribed along with the Traditions of the Otomi-Chichimecas of Toliman, Peña de Bernal, Querétaro.
The recognition carries the responsibility for Mexico to safeguard and promote the tradition to keep it alive. A part of the nomination process was an extensive regional plan of preservation, promotion and development of the cultural heritage in Veracruz and other parts of Mexico and Central America.
One effort that has been underway is the establishment of the Escuela de Niños Voladores (School of Volador Children), which is located at Takilhsukut Park and is the first formal school for voladores. It has a student population of between 70 and 100 students who learn about the history, significance and values associated with the ritual from the pre-Hispanic period. These include those associated with the taking of the pole, called a tsakáe kiwi, from the forest, an aspect of the ritual that is in danger of extinction. The school is sponsored by the Veracruz state government and children begin attending between 6 and 8 years of age. Most come from the neighboring communities of Plan de Hidalgo, El Tajín, San Lorenzo and Arroyos del Arco and Oxital, and whose fathers and grandfathers are voladores. The school requires students to meet certain requirements, such as being able to speak Totonac and girls are not permitted. However, most voladores learn the ritual from their fathers and grandfathers starting at age eight or ten. To become a volador in the traditional Totonac community requires 10 to 12 years of preparation and many consider it to be a life vocation.
Another effort to conserve and promote the tradition is the Encuentro de Voladores (Volador Encounter), which was begun in 2009 and coincides with the Cumbre Tajín spring equinox event of the El Tajín site. For five days, voladores from various places perform at the poles erected at the site. The objective is not only to see the different costumes and styles of the groups but to share experiences about the fertility ritual. Voladores come from as far as San Luis Potosí and Guatemala.
One reason for the need of protection is that in most cases in Mexico, the ritual is not performed for religious purposes. The first organization for voladores came about in the 1970s but also the commercialization of the ritual. There are about 600 professional voladores in Mexico.
In smaller communities, the ritual is enacted only on the feast day of the community's patron saint or other religious events, but in larger communities, especially where there are tourists, it is performed as an attraction for donations. Two examples of this are the voladores that perform in Xcaret and Xel-Ha, and the Totonac voladores in Chapultepec Park in Mexico City, who are one of the parks major attractions. Some groups of voladores try to balance respect for the ritual while still performing for spectators. There is a formal established group in Boca del Río that has been recognized by municipal authorities and receives support in the way of space and a permanent pole.. The goal of the group is to offer to tourists a dignified version of the ritual at the Plaza Bandera that does not forget its roots. Members of the group are all natives of the city of Papantla. The ceremony is held in a public park and youths are required to leave items such as bicycles and skateboards outside the ceremonial space.
To promote the ritual and the culture behind it internationally, groups of voladores have performed in many parts of Mexico and other countries as part of cultural festivals. Voladores have performed at the Zapopum Festival in Guadalajara, the Festival of San Pedro in Monterrey, the Indian Summer Festival in Milwaukee, the Carnaval Cultural in Valparaíso, the Forum Universal de las Culturas in Barcelona, and at an intercultural show in New York.
In popular culture.
In episode 6 of the animated series "Onyx Equinox", the characters visit the Totonac city of Tajin, where people perform the dance, but can actually grow bird wings and fly.
During the song "Without Question" from the Dreamworks animated film The Road to El Dorado, Miguel takes part in the ritual.

28 Fundamental Beliefs

The 28 fundamental beliefs are the core beliefs of Seventh-day Adventist theology. Adventists are opposed to the formulation of creeds, so the 28 fundamental beliefs are considered "descriptors", not "prescriptors"; that is, that they describe the official position of the church but are not criteria for membership. These beliefs were originally known as the 27 fundamental beliefs when adopted by the church's General Conference in 1980. An additional belief (number 11) was added in 2005. The "Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary" is a significant expression of Adventist theological thought.
They may be grouped into the doctrines of God, humanity, salvation, the church, Christian life, and the restoration.
History.
Adventists have historically been reluctant to formalize a creed. In the October 8, 1861 Review and Herald, J. N. Loughborough wrote:The first step of apostasy is to get up a creed, telling us what we shall believe. The second is, to make that creed a test of fellowship. The third is to try members by that creed. The fourth to denounce as heretics those who do not believe that creed. And fifth, to commence persecution against such.Several summaries of Adventist theology have been presented at various times.
Preamble.
The preamble to the 28 Fundamentals states that Adventists accept the Bible as their only creed, and that revision of the statements may be expected during the church General Conference Session:
Seventh-day Adventists accept the Bible as their only creed and hold certain fundamental beliefs to be the teaching of the Holy Scriptures. These beliefs, as set forth here, constitute the church's understanding and expression of the teaching of Scripture. Revision of these statements may be expected at a General Conference Session when the church is led by the Holy Spirit to a fuller understanding of Bible truth or finds better language in which to express the teachings of God's Holy Word.

Our Lady of the Mississippi Abbey

The Abbey of Our Lady of the Mississippi is located near Dubuque, Iowa. The nuns there are members of the branch of the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance, commonly referred to as Trappistines. They are a part of the Catholic Church in the Archdiocese of Dubuque.
History.
In 1960, the Trappistine nuns of Mount Saint Mary's Abbey in Wrentham, Massachusetts had decided that they had exceeded the capacity of their monastery, due to the great number of religious vocations of that era. They therefore decided it was time to make a new foundation.
The original site was to be in Argentina, where there was already a new monastery founded by the monks of the Trappist abbey near to Wrentham. That site did not work out, however, so the abbess, Mother Angela, O.C.S.O., asked the Trappists abbots of the United States for possible sites. The abbot of New Melleray Abbey offered to assume responsibility for such a foundation.
After a period of searching for a suitable location, and the generous donation of a benefactor, in July 1964 the "Hickory Hill" estate, south of Dubuque, became available and was recommended as a suitable site. The abbey was founded in 1964 when the first thirteen nuns left in to settle on the present site of the abbey, under the leadership of Mother Columba Guare, O.C.S.O. The nuns began making candy soon after, as a source of income, but they also attempted to support the monastery through farming, growing Christmas trees, and raising livestock.
The monastery was declared an autonomous community and raised to the status of abbey on 3 May 1968. Two years later, on 7 May, Mother Columba was elected as the first abbess of the community. She continued to lead the community until 1982. She was succeeded by Mother Gail Fitzpatrick, who served as abbess until 2006 when Mother Nettie Louise Gamble, O.C.S.O. was elected. Mother Rebecca Stramoski was elected abbess in 2012 and was re-elected in 2018 for a second six year term.
Today.
Currently the abbey is home to about 20 nuns, who, as required by the Rule of St Benedict, spend their days in a balance between choral and private prayer, "lectio divina" (meditative reading of Scripture and other spiritual books) and manual labor. The Abbey supports itself primarily with candy making, but also farms the land it owns on the bluffs of the Mississippi River. Visitors are welcome to make a retreat and stay in any of several guesthouses on the property but these are often booked months in advance.
The nuns have a daily routine that involves spending a large part of their day in prayer, work, and contemplation. Each day begins with the Office of Vigil at 3:45 a.m.. Compline, the last prayer of the Liturgy of the Hours, is at 7:15 p.m.
The Abbey is well known for candy, Trappistine Creamy Caramels. From September through December the Sisters make over a ton of caramels each week and ship them worldwide. The nuns operate an onsite gift shop stocked with candy from their factory as well as various religious gifts.
Expansion.
In 1999, the nuns of the abbey decided to begin a daughter foundation, Tautra Abbey, in Tautra, Norway, and five nuns of Mississippi Abbey and two Norwegian nuns from other monasteries arrived there. In March 2006, Tautra Mariakloster became an autonomous priory.

Geliy Korzhev

Geliy Mikhailovich Korzhev-Chuvelyov (; 7 July 1925 – 27 August 2012) was a Soviet and Russian painter.
Life.
He studied at Moscow State Art School from 1939 to 1944 under Vasily Pochitalov, Mikhail Dobroserdov, and Mikhail Barshch. From 1944 to 1950 he studied at the Moscow State Art Institute under Sergey Gerasimov and Vasily Pochitalov. A painter in Soviet approved style of socialist realism, he continued to be active after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and remained a supporter of Communism.
Politics.
Unwavering in his political views, in the late 1990s the artist refused a state award bestowed upon him by the government of the Russian Federation, and Korzhev wrote of his motives:
I was born in the Soviet Union and sincerely believed in the ideas and ideals of the time. Today, they are considered a historical mistake. Now Russia has a social system directly opposite to the one under which I, as an artist, was brought up. The acceptance of a state award would be equal to a confession of my hypocrisy throughout my artistic career. I request that you consider my refusal with due understanding.
Death.
He died on August 27, 2012. He was buried at Alekseyevskoye Cemetery in Moscow. The monument on the grave was made by grandson Ivan under the sketches of the artist himself.

Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram

Thillai Nataraja Temple, also referred as the Chidambaram Nataraja Temple, is a Hindu temple dedicated to Nataraja, the form of Shiva as the lord of dance (cosmic dancer). This temple is located in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, India. This temple has ancient roots and a Shiva shrine existed at the site when the town was known as Thillai. Chidambaram, the name of the city literally means "stage of consciousness". The temple architecture symbolizes the connection between the arts and spirituality, creative activity and the divine. The temple wall carvings display all the 108 karanas from the "Natya Shastra" by Bharata Muni, and these postures form a foundation of Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance. it is the only Shiva temple common to both the Pancha Sabha Thalam and the Pancha Bhuta Thalam.
The present temple was built in the 10th century when Chidambaram was the capital of the Chola dynasty. After its 10th-century consecration by the Cholas who considered Nataraja as their family deity, the temple has been damaged, repaired, renovated and expanded through the 2nd millennium. Most of the temple's surviving plan, architecture and structure is from the late 12th and early 13th centuries, with later additions in similar style. While Shiva as Nataraja is the primary deity of the temple, it reverentially presents major themes from Shaktism, Vaishnavism, and other traditions of Hinduism. The Chidambaram temple complex, for example, has the earliest known Amman or Devi temple in South India, a pre-13th-century Surya shrine with chariot, shrines for Ganesha, Murugan and Vishnu, one of the earliest known Shiva Ganga sacred pools, large mandapas for the convenience of pilgrims (choultry, "ambalam" or "sabha") and other monuments. Shiva himself is presented as the Nataraja performing the Ananda Tandava ("Dance of Delight") in the golden hall of the shrine "Pon Ambalam".
The temple is one of the five elemental lingas in the Shaivism pilgrimage tradition, and considered the subtlest of all Shiva temples ("Kovil") in Hinduism. It is also a site for performance arts, including the annual Natyanjali dance festival on Maha Shivaratri.
Etymology.
Chidambaram is one of the many temple towns in the state which is named after the groves, clusters or forests dominated by a particular variety of a tree or shrub and the same variety of tree or shrub sheltering the presiding deity. The town used to be called Thillai, following Thillaivanam, derived from the mangrove of "Tillai" trees ("Excoecaria agallocha") that grow here and the nearby Pichavaram wetlands.
The site became the capital of Cholas in the 10th century, and they renamed it to Chidambaram and built the current temple for their family deity of Nataraja Shiva. The word "Chidambaram" comes from the Tamil word "Chitrambalam" (also spelled "Chithambalam") meaning "wisdom atmosphere". The roots are "citt" or "chitthu" means "consciousness or wisdom", while "ampalam" means "atmosphere". This composite word comes from its association with Shiva Nataraja, the cosmic dancer and the cultural atmosphere for arts. The word Chidambaram is translated by James Lochtefeld as "clothed in thought".
The town and temple name appears in medieval Hindu texts by various additional names such as Kovil (lit. "the temple"), Pundarikapuram, Vyagrapuram, Sirrampuram, Puliyur and Chitrakuta. Additional names for Chidambaram in Pallava era and North Indian texts include Kanagasabainathar, Ponnambalam, Brahmastpuri and Brahmapuri.
Location.
The Nataraja temple in Chidambaram is located in the southeastern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is about north of the Kollidam River (Kaveri), west from the coast of Bay of Bengal, and south of Chennai. The closest major airport is about north in Pondicherry (IATA: PNY). The National Highway 32 (old numbering: NH-45A) passes through Chidambaram. The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation and private companies operate services connecting it to major cities in the state. The site is linked to the Indian Railways with daily express trains to South Indian cities.
Chidambaram is a temple town, with the Nataraja complex spread over within a nearly square courtyard in the center. Its side roads are aligned to the east–west, north–south axis. It has double walls around its periphery with gardens. It has had entrance gateways on all four sides.
History.
The Nataraja temple has ancient roots, early textual evidence, such as those of the Sangam tradition, suggest a temple existed here along with Madurai in ancient times, but the town is not named Chidambaram in these pre-5th-century texts. The earliest mention of "dancing god of Chidambaram" as Shiva is found in 6th- and early-7th-century texts by Appar and Sambadar. The "Suta Samhita" embedded inside "Sri Kanda Puranam" and variously dated between 7th and 10th century mentions the Chidambaram dance. Likely following the temple architecture tradition that is found all over South India from at least the 5th century when many older brick and wooden temples were being replaced by more lasting temples from cut stone as the building blocks in dozens of places across South India. The surviving Nataraja temple has a structure that is traceable to the early Chola Dynasty. Chidambaram was the early capital of this dynasty, and Shiva Nataraja was their family deity. The Chidambaram temple town remained important to the Cholas, albeit with increasing competition from other temple towns when Rajaraja Chola I moved the capital to Thanjavur, built a new city and the massive Brihadeeswarar Temple dedicated to Shiva in the early 11th century, which is now a world heritage site.
Nataraja Shiva and his "dance of bliss" is an ancient Hindu art concept. It is found in various texts such as "Tatva Nidhi" which describes seven types of dance and their spiritual symbolism, "Kashyapa Silpa" which describes 18 dance forms with iconographic details and design instructions, as well as Bharata's ancient treatise on performance arts "Natya Shastra" which describes 108 dance postures among other things. Reliefs and sculptures of Nataraja have been found across the Indian subcontinent, some dating to the 6th century and earlier such as in Aihole and Badami cave temples.
The earliest historically verifiable Shiva temple at Chidambaram is traceable in inscriptions that date to the rule of Aditya Chola I in the early 10th century, and far more during the rule of the 10th-century Chola king Parantaka Chola I. For them, the dancing Shiva was the "kula-nayaka" (family guide or deity) and Chidambaram was the capital they built. These inscriptions and texts from this period suggest that the significance of the "Agama texts" and Shaiva Bhakti movement was strengthening within the Chola leadership and thought.
The copper plate inscriptions of Parantaka I (c. 907–955 CE) describe him as the "bee at the lotus feet of Shiva" who built the golden house for Shiva, with Chit-sabha, Hema-sabha, Hiranya-sabha and Kanaka-sabha (all mandapam, pillared pilgrim rest places). He is referred to as "Pon veinda Perumal", which means "one who covered with gold" the Chit-sabha of Chidambaram. Both Aditya I and his Chola successor Parantaka I were active supporters of arts and temple building. They converted many older brick and wooden temples into more lasting temples from cut stone as the building blocks in dozens of places across South India.
Raja Raja Chola I (985–1013 CE) embarked on a mission to recover the hymns of the 63 Nayanmars after hearing short excerpts of the "Tevaram" in his court. He sought the help of Nambiyandar Nambi, who was a priest in a temple. It is believed that by divine intervention Nambi found the presence of scripts, in the form of cadijam leaves half eaten by white ants in a chamber inside the second precinct in the temple. The "brahmanas" (Dikshitars) in the temple are supposed to have disagreed with the king by saying that the works were too divine, and that only by the arrival of the "Naalvar" (the four saints)—Appar, Sundarar, Tirugnanasambandar and Manickavasagar would they allow for the chambers to be opened. Rajaraja, however, created idols of them and prepared for them to be brought to the temple through a procession. but Rajaraja is said to have prevailed. Rajaraja thus became known as "Tirumurai Kanda Cholan" meaning one who saved the "Tirumurai".
In another version of the story, Rajaraja is said to have experienced a dream from lord Shiva telling Rajaraja that the hymns in Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram are in a state of destruction and to recover the remaining hymns from the chambers. The "brahmanas" (Dikshitars) in the temple, however, are supposed to have disagreed with the king by saying that the works were too divine to be accessed, and that only by the arrival of the 63 Nayanmars would they allow for the chambers to be opened. Rajaraja, devising a plan, consecrated idols of each of them and prepared for them to be brought into the temple through a procession. It is said that the 63 idols are still present in the Thillai Nataraja Temple. When the vault was opened, Rajaraja is said to have found the room infested with white ants, and that the hymns were salvaged as much as possible.
The temple, according to inscriptions found in South India and Southeast Asia, was also historic recipient of a precious jewel from the king of Angkor who built the Angkor Wat through Chola king Kulothunga, who submitted it to the temple in 1114 CE. Kulothunga I and his son expanded the Chidambaram Nataraja temple sixfold.
Chidambaram temple thrived during the Chola dynasty rule through mid-13th century, along with the later Shiva-based Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram capitals, as well as Vishnu-based Srirangam temple towns. Its facilities infrastructure was expanded. Naralokaviran, the general of king Kulothunga Chola I was responsible for building the steps that lead to Sivaganga water pool, a goddess shrine, a shrine for child saint Thirugnana Sambanthar, temple gardens and a pilgrim road network in and around Chidambaram. He constructed a hall for recitation of "Tevaram" hymns and engraved the hymns in copper plates. The thousand pillar choultry, with friezes narrating Hindu texts, was built in the late 12th century. Between the second half of the 12th century and the early 13th century, the Chola kings added colorful and high gopura stone gateways as easily identifiable landmarks, starting with the western gopura. Thereafter, about mid 13th century, the Pandya dynasty ended the Chola dynasty. The Hindu Pandyas were liberal supporters of Chidambaram temple, along with other Shiva and Vishnu temples, just like the Chola. Sundara Pandya added the huge eastern gopura at Chidambaram, beginning the colossal gateway tradition. Most of the structure and plans currently seen in the Chidambaram complex, including the mandapas with their pillar carvings, the various shrines with polished granite sculptures, the sacred water pool and the early gopurams are from the 12th and 13th century, attributed to the late Chola and early Pandya kings.
Invasions.
In the north, the Indian subcontinent had been conquered by the Delhi Sultanate. Muslim armies had begun raiding central India for plunder by the late 13th century. In 1311, when Sultan Alauddin Khilji ordered his general Malik Kafur and his forces to invade southern Hindu kingdoms, he went deeper into the Indian peninsula for loot and to establish annual tribute agreement between the kingdoms and the Sultanate. The records left by the court historians of the Delhi Sultanate state that Malik Kafur raided Chidambaram, Srirangam, Madurai and other Tamil towns, destroyed the temples, and the Nataraja temple was one of the sources of gold and jewels booty he brought back to Delhi.
The temple towns of Tamil Nadu were again targeted for loot in the 1320s. However, when the news of another invasion spread in Tamil lands, the community removed them into the Western Ghats or buried numerous sculptures and treasures in the land and concealed chambers underneath temples sites before the Muslim armies reached them. A large number of these were rediscovered in archaeological excavations at the site in and after 1979, including those in Chidambaram. According to Nagaswamy, those who buried the temple artworks followed the Hindu Agama texts such as "Marici Samhita" and "Vimanarcanakalpa" that recommend ritually burying precious metal murtis as a means of protection when war and robbery is imminent. Over 200 such items have been recovered, including relevant hordes of copper plate inscriptions.
The Islamic invasion in the 14th century, states George Michell – a professor and art historian of Indian architecture, brought an abrupt end to the patronage of Chidambaram and other temple towns. The Delhi Sultan appointed a Muslim governor, who seceded within the few years from the Delhi Sultanate and began the Madurai Sultanate. This Sultanate sought tribute from the temple towns, instead of supporting them. The Muslim Madurai Sultanate was relatively short lived, with Hindu Vijayanagara Empire removing it in the late 14th century. The Vijayanagara rulers restored, repaired and expanded the temple through the 16th century, along with many other regional temples. These kings themselves went on pilgrimage to Chidambaram, and gifted resources to strengthen its walls and infrastructure.
The decline and dissolution of the Vijayanagara Empire in the late 16th century by an alliance of Sultanates, followed within a few decades by entrance of Portuguese, French and British colonial interests brought geopolitical uncertainties to Chidambaram and other temple towns. The Portuguese were already a major Coromandel Coast trading group by the early 17th century, a region to which Chidambaram belonged. The Portuguese began building forts, garrison and churches in Coromandel Coast region after the demise of Vijayanagara, triggering the intervention of the French and the British. By the mid-17th century, the temple complex was within the patronage of Nayakas, who repaired the temple and repainted the frescoes on mandapa ceilings. According to Michell, these restorations likely occurred about 1643 CE during the reign of Shrirangadeva Raya III.
According to British reports, Chidambaram temple town had to bear the "brunt of several severe onslaughts" between the French and the British colonial forces several times particularly in the 18th century.
Legend.
The Chidambaram temple legend is contained in the 12th-century text "Chidambara-mahatmya". The central episode states that Shiva visits sages in the mythical forest in the form of a dancer mendicant (Bhikshatana) accompanied by Mohini, Vishnu in his avatar as a beautiful woman. Mohini triggers lustful interest of the sages, while Shiva performs Tandava dance that triggers the carnal interest of the wives of these sages. The sages ultimately realise how superficial their austerities have been. The episode becomes widely known. Two sages named Patanjali (also called Sesha-bodied in the south for his connection to Vishnu) and Vyaghrapada (also called Tiger-footed sage) want to see the repeat performance of this "dance of bliss" in the Thaillai forest, Chidambaram. They set up a Shivalinga, pray, meditate and wait. Their asceticism impresses Shiva who appeared before them in Chidambaram and performed "the dance" against "the wall, in the blessed hall of consciousness". This is how this temple started, according to the mahatmya embedded in the Tamil "Sthalapurana". According to Kulke, the late medieval text "Chidambaramahatmya" may reflect a process of Sanskritisation, where these North Indian named sages with Vedic links became incorporated into regional temple mythology.
According to a Hindu legend, once Shiva and his consort Parvati wanted to judge who among them was a better dancer, and wanted their sons Ganesha and Murugan to judge their performances. Both of them judged in favour of Parvati, after which Shiva was not satisfied. He wanted Brahma to judge, and the competition was held in Thiruvalangadu. Brahma was still not satisfied, and he wanted Vishnu to judge, and the latter wanted the competition in Tillaivanam. Shiva performed the Urthvathandavam pose of picking his earring with his legs, and wearing them in the ear with his legs. Parvati was not able to perform the feat. Vishnu was Impressed and declared Shiva as the winner. Parvati got angry due to her frustration at her defeat, became Kali at the Thillai Kali temple.
According to another Hindu legend, Mahalingaswamy at Thiruvidaimarudur is the centre of all Shiva temples in the region and the "Saptha Vigraha moorthis" (seven prime deities in all Shiva temples) are located at seven cardinal points around the temple, located in various parts of the state. The seven deities are Nataraja in Chidambaram Nataraja Temple at Chidambaram, Chandikeswarar temple at Tirucheingalur, Ganesha in Vellai Vinayagar Temple at Thiruvalanchuzhi, Murugan in Swamimalai Murugan Temple at Swamimalai, Bhairava in Sattainathar Temple at Sirkali, Navagraha in Sooriyanar Temple at Suryanar Kovil, Dakshinamoorthy in Apatsahayesvarar Temple at Alangudi. 
The temple, also called Perumpatrapuliyur in this context, is one of the Nava Puliyur Temples worshipped by Patanjali and Vyaghrapada. The other temples are Thirupathiripuliyur, Erukathampuliyur, Omampuliyur, Sirupuliyur, Atthippuliyur, Thaplampuliyur, Perumpuliyur and Kanattampuliyur.
Description.
Architecture.
The temple as it stands had a pre-Chola existence and the architecture is a combination of Chola and Pandyan architecture with the Sanctum Sanctorum closely resembling Kerala style structures. Indeed, the royal charters mention the rebuilding of the Sanctum using architects from Kerala. However, the golden roof is a striking example of Vesara architecture with its apsidal shape. Two small structures called the Chit Sabha and Kanak Sabha form the crux of the vast architectural complex. The temple is spread over a area, within layers of concentric courtyards. The inner sanctum, its connecting mandapams and pillared halls near it are all either squares or stacked squares or both. The complex has nine gopurams, several water storage structures of which the Shivaganga sacred pool is the largest with a rectangular plan. The temple complex is dedicated to Nataraja Shiva and theological ideas associated with Shaivism concepts in Hinduism. However, the temple also includes shrines for Devi, Vishnu, Subrahmanyar, Ganesha, Nandi and others including an Amman shrine, a Surya shrine complete with Chariot wheels. The plan has numerous gathering halls called "sabha", two major choultry called the 100 pillared and 1,000 pillared halls, inscriptions and frescoes narrating Hindu legends about gods, goddesses, saints and scholars.
Courtyards.
The Nataraja Temple complex is embedded inside four "prakarams" (courtyards). Each courtyard has walls that were defensively fortified after the 14th-century plunder and destruction. 
The outermost wall around the fourth courtyard has four gateways. The walls and gateways of the fourth courtyard were added in the 16th century by Vijayanagara rulers after they had defeated the Madurai Sultanate, and this outermost layer was heavily fortified by the Nayakas in the 17th century. These face the four large gopurams that are gateways into the third courtyard. These gopurams are also landmarks from afar. Inside the third courtyard, near the northern gopuram, is the Shivaganga tank, the thousand pillar mandapam, the Subrahmanyar (Murugan, Kartikeya) shrine and the shrine for Parvati (as Shivakama Sundari). The other three gateways are closer to the sanctum. The four gopurams pilgrims and visitors to enter the temple from all four cardinal directions. The complex is interconnected through a maze of pathways.
The courtyard walls and gateways are made from cut stones with some brick structure added in. The gardens and palm groves are in the fourth courtyard, outside the walls of the third courtyard walls with the four large gopurams. These were restored or added in by the Vijayanagara rulers in the 16th century.
Towers: gopurams.
The temple has nine major gopuram gateways connecting the various courtyards. Four of these are huge and colorful, visible from afar, a symbolic and convenient landmark for pilgrims. These gateway towers or "gopurams" each have 7 storeys facing the East, South, West and North. The first edition of the four gopuram superstructures were likely built between 1150 and 1300 CE. The earliest was likely the western gopuram, which is also the smaller of the four. This is generally dated to about 1150 CE. The eastern gopura was likely completed by about 1200 CE, southern gopura by the mid-13th century, while the northern was added in the late 13th century. The four high gopurams were destroyed, rebuilt, repaired, enlarged and redecorated several times after the 13th century. This has made the gopurams difficult to place chronologically, yet useful in scholarly studies of the history of the Nataraja temple.
All gopurams are built of precisely cut large stone blocks all the way to the main cornice. Upon this is a stone, brick and plaster structure with layers of pavilions. Above these "talas" (storeys) is a South Indian style barrel vaulted roof, crowned with thirteen "kalasa" finials. All of them are similar in size with a 14:10:3 ratio, about high, wide and deep.
Artwork on the gopuram.
Each gopuram is colorful and unique in its own ways. They narrate stories from various Hindu texts, showing religious and secular scenes from the various Hindu traditions. This art is presented in each gopuram with anthropomorphic figure panels and about fifty niches with stone sculptures in every gopuram. The scenes include multiple panels about the legend of Shiva-Parvati wedding with Brahma, Vishnu, Saraswati and Lakshmi attending, dancing Ganesha, Shiva in his various aspects, Durga in the middle of her war with a demon, Skanda ready for war, seated Nandi, musicians, dancers, farmers, merchants, sadhu in namaste posture, dancing dvarapalas near the vertical center line and others. The artists and architects who built these gopura may have had a rationale in the relative sequence and position of the artwork with respect to each other and on various levels, but this is unclear and a subject of disagreement among scholars.
The earliest built western gopuram is the only one with inscriptions below each artwork that identifies what it is. The artwork on it includes Durga fighting the evil, shape shifting buffalo demon and Skanda sitting on peacock and dressed up for war. Other artwork found on the eastern gopuram include Surya, Ganapati, Vishnu, Sridevi (Lakshmi), Tripura Sundari, Brahma, Saraswati, Varuna, Durga, Agni, several "rishis", Yamuna goddess, Kama and Rati, Budha, the Vedic sages such as Narada and Agastya, Pantanjali, Somaskanda legend, Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati), Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva), several forms of dancing Shiva and others.
The surviving south "gopuram" called the "Sokkaseeyan Thirunilai Ezhugopuram" was constructed by a Pandya king identified from the presence of the dynasty's fish emblem sculpted on the ceiling. The Pandyas sculpted two fishes facing each other when they completed "gopurams" (and left it with one fish, in case it was incomplete). Other artwork found on the southern gopuram include Chandesha, Ganapati, Vishnu, Sridevi (Lakshmi), several Devis, Brahma, Saraswati, Surya, Chandra, Durga, Indra, Agni, several "rishis", Ganga and Yamuna goddesses, Kama and Rati, Budha, the Vedic sages such as Narada, Pantanjali, Somaskanda legend, Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati), Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva), several forms of dancing and standing Shiva such as Pashupata, Kiratarjuna and Lingobhava, as well as others.
The eastern gopuram features the 108 reliefs of Natya Shastra dance postures (22 cm each in a separate niche) and faces the sanctum. The eastern gopuram is credited to king Koperunsingan II (1243-1279 CE) as per epigraphical records and was repaired with support from a woman named Subbammal in the late 18th century.
The northern gopuram was repaired and finished by the Vijayanagara king Krishnadevaraya (1509-1530 CE) in the 16th century. The eastern and northern gopura also depicts the wide range of narratives as the southern and western gopuram.
The idols of Pachaiappa Mudaliar and his wife Iyalammal have been sculpted on the eastern "gopuram". The Pachaiappa Trust to date has been responsible for various functions in the temple and also maintain the temple car. The eastern gopuram is renowned for its complete enumeration of 108 poses of Indian classical dance – Bharathanatyam, detailed in small rectangular panels along the passage that leads to the gateway.
Shrines.
The temple complex has many shrines, most of which are related to Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Shaktism. The innermost structures such as the sanctum and the shrines, all have square plans, but the gateways do not align except the innermost two courtyards.
Shaivism.
The sanctum of the temple is set inside the innermost 1st prakara which is a square with about side. This prakara is offset towards the west inside the 2nd prakara, which is also a square with about side. The Shiva sanctum is unusual as it does not have a Shivalinga, rather it has the Chit Sabha (consciousness gathering, also called "chit ambalam") with an image of Shiva Nataraja. This introspective empty space has a curtained space that is 3.5 meter long and 1.5 meter wide. It is called the "rahasya" (secret) in Hindu texts. It consists of two layers, one red, the other black. According to George Michell, this is a symbolism in Hinduism of "enlightenment inside, illusion outside". It is replaced on the tenth day of the main festivals. The Chidambaram Rahasya is the "formless" representation of Shiva as the metaphysical Brahman in Hinduism, sometimes explained as "akasha linga" and divine being same as Self (Atman) that is everywhere, in everything, eternally.
Facing the "Chit Sabha" is the "Kanaka Sabha" (also called "pon ambalam"), or the gathering of dancers. These two sanctum spaces are connected by five silver gilded steps called the "panchakshara". The ceiling of the Chit Sabha is made of wooden pillars coated with gold, while copper coats the Kanaka Sabha is copper colored.
Vaishnavism.
The Nataraja temple complex incorporates Vaishnava themes and images like many Hindu temples in South India. A Vishnu shrine is found inside the sanctum of the temple in its southwest corner. According to George Michell and others, Chola kings revered Shiva, with Tyagaraja and Nataraja as their family deity. Yet, their urban Shaiva centers "echo a very strong substratum of Vaishnava traditions". This historic inclusiveness is reflected in Chidambaram with Vishnu Govindaraja in the same sanctum home by the side of Nataraja. After the turmoil of the 14th century when the temple was attacked and looted, there was period when some priests sought to restore only Shaiva iconography according to extant Portuguese Jesuit records. However, the Vijayanagara rulers insisted on the re-consecration of all historic traditions. The temple inscriptions confirm that Vishnu was included along with Shiva in the temple's earliest version, and was reinstalled when the temple was reopened by the Vijayanagara kings.
Some texts from the time of king Kulottunga II give conflicting reports, wherein the Shaiva texts state that the king removed the Vishnu image while Vaishnava texts state that they took it away and installed it in Tirupati, sometime about 1135 CE. The scholar Vedanta Desika re-established the co-consecration in 1370 CE, about the time Vijayanagara Empire conquered Chidambaram and northern Tamil lands from the Madurai Sultanate. The current shrine, states Michell, is from 1539 financed by king Achyutaraya and it features a reclining figure of Vishnu.
The Govindaraja shrine is one of the 108 holy temples of Vishnu called "divyadesam", revered by the 7th-to-9th-century saint poets of "Vaishnava" tradition, "Alwars". Kulashekhara Alwar mentions this temple as "Tillai Chitrakutam" and equates Chitrakuta of "Ramayana" fame with this shrine. The shrine has close connections with the Govindaraja temple in Tirupati dating back to saint Ramanuja of the 11th and 12th centuries.
Shaktism.
The main Devi shrine in the Nataraja temple complex is offset towards the north of the sanctum inside the third prakara, and found to the west of the Shivaganga pool. It is called the Shivakama Sundari shrine, dedicated to Parvati. The temple faces east and has an embedded square plan, though the stacked squares created a long rectangular space. The shrine has its own walls and an entrance gateway (gopura). Inside is the dedicated mandapas and brightly colored frescoes likely from the 17th-century Vijayanagara period. These narrate the story of Shiva and Vishnu together challenging the "learned sages, ascetics and their wives" in the forest, by appearing in the form of a beautiful beggar that dances (bhikshatanamurti) and a beautiful girl that seduces (Mohini) respectively. Another set of frescoes are secular depicting temple festivities and daily life of people, while a stretch narrates the story of Hindu saints named Manikkavachakar and Mukunda.
The shrine had artwork narrating the "Devi Mahatmya", a classic Sanskrit text of Shaktism tradition. However, in 1972, these were removed given their dilapidated state. These were replaced with a different story. Other parts of the paintings and shrine also show great damage.
The sanctum of the Shivakama Sundari shrine is dedicated to Devi, where she is Shiva's knowledge ("jnana shakti"), desire ("iccha sakti"), action ("kriya sakti") and compassion ("karuna sakti"). The oldest Shivakama Sundari sculpture at the site representing these aspects of the goddess has been dated to the king Parantaka I period, about 950 CE.
Others.
The Nataraja temple has a pre-13th-century Surya shrine. The image is unusual as it depicts a three headed Surya same as Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu, with eight hands holding iconographic items of these deities, along with two lotuses in a pair of hands in front, accompanied by two small female figures possibly Usha and Pratyusha, standing on a chariot drawn by seven horses and Aruna as charioteer. The temple also has a significant shrine for Ganesha in the southwest corner and a Subrahmanyar shrine in the northwest corner of the third courtyard.
Halls: sabha.
The temple has many halls called "sabha" (lit. "community gathering", also called "ambalams" or "sabhai") inside the complex. Two of these are the Chit Sabha and the Kanaka Sabha inside the sanctum area of the Nataraja shrine, described earlier. The other halls are:
Nrithya sabha.
Nrithya sabha (also called Nritta Sabha, Natya sabha, or "Hall of Dance") is a "so-called 56-pillared" hall. It is in the south section of the second courtyard that circumambulates the Nataraja sanctum of the complex. This second courtyard is near the temple's flag mast ("kodi maram" or "dwaja sthambam"). The 13th-century Nritta Sabha is traditionally considered as the place where Shiva and Kali originally entered into a dance competition. Shiva won with the "urdhva-tandava" pose that raised his right leg straight up, a posture that Kali refused because she was a woman. The hall is rectangular consisting of three stacked squares, a 15-meter-sided square that is the main hall, which is connected to 4 meters by 8 meters rectangular "mukha-mandapa" to its north. The hall now has 50 pillars, but evidence suggests that it may have had 56 or more pillars earlier. These pillars are intricately carved from top to bottom. The lower levels have dancers in "Natya Shastra" mudras accompanied with expressive musicians as if both are enjoying creating the music and the dance. The pillars also have embedded narratives of legends from Hindu texts, such as of Durga fighting the buffalo demon, as well as humorous dwarfs frolicking. Below the kapota, the structures show reliefs of seated people, many in "namaste" posture, some with a beard and yogi like appearance representing saints and rishis. Nearly 200 of these are still visible, rest appear to have been damaged or eroded over time.
The Nrithya Sabha platform's base is carved as a chariot, with horses and wheels, as if it is rising out the ground. Historic texts state that the wheels were exquisitely carved and visible in the past, each about 1.25 meters (4.1 ft) in diameter with 28 spokes and 33 medallions, the chariot has ornamented horses 1.55 meters (5.1 ft) in height, on the wheel is a seated rishi as if he was guiding the movement. Only remnants of this structure remains now. The northern niche of the hall is carved with 14 figures in addition to Shiva as Kanakamurti. The Shiva image had been damaged and is now restored. The 14 figures include Surya (sun god), Chandra (moon god) and 12 rishis of which Narada and Tumburu with Vina can be identified, the others have been too damaged to identify but are likely Vedic rishis. Near them are women in seductive postures, some nudes, likely the wives of the rishis. Next to the northern niche with Shiva are two smaller niches, one for Patanjali seated on coiled serpent and another for Vyaghrapada, two mythical Chidambaram saints. The western wall also has a niche with a large Shiva image in his Vrisabhantika form. Once again rishis are with him, this time in "namaste" posture. A few figures are dressed royally like warriors and these may be representation of the Chola kings.
The hall's center is an open square, with an ornate inverted lotus ceiling decoration. Around this lotus are 108 coffers, each with two human figures in "namaste" posture, all oriented to be along the north–south axis likely to suggest the direction to performance artists who would perform live and aligning themselves to the "chit sabha" in the sanctum.
Raja sabha: 1,000 pillar hall.
Raja sabha or the 1000-pillared hall is to the east of the Shivaganga pool, in the northeast part of the third courtyard. A pillared pathway from the eastern gopuram leads to it. It was a choultry for pilgrims with a convenient access to the pool. The hall's lower mouldings have dance mudras and medieval era musical instruments being played by musicians. The pillars have reliefs. It is now kept closed, except for festivals.
Shatasila sabha: 100 pillar hall.
This is northwest of the sanctum, south of the Devi shrine. It is badly damaged and closed to public.
Deva sabha.
Deva Sabhai is on the eastern side of the second courtyard. It is called "Perampalam", literally "Great Hall" in the inscriptions, which suggests that it is an early structure and was historically important. According to Nanda and Michell, this may be the hall where Shaiva bhakti saints Nayanars came and sang hymns. It may also have hosted royal visits during the Chola era times.
The Deva sabha (divine gathering hall) houses the temple's revered collection of historic bronze sculptures and modern era frescoes. One of the paintings show Parvati seated in a chair, watching the Nrithya sabha hall.
Temple tanks.
The Chidambaram temple is well endowed with several water bodies within and around the temple complex.
Inscriptions.
Even though the history of the temple goes back to the "Prabhandas" and "Tevaram", that is the Pallava period, the earliest known inscriptions are only that of Rajendra Chola and Kulothunga I followed by Vikrama Chola and other later rulers. The Nataraja temple inscriptions are notable for mentioning a library of manuscripts in temple premises. Two inscriptions dated to the early 13th century mention re-organization of old temple library. According to Hartmut Scharfe, the older library mentioned may date to the early 12th century. The inscriptions, states Scharfe, recite that the temple employed twenty librarians, of which eight copied old manuscripts to create new editions, two verified the copy matched the original and four managed the proper storage of the manuscripts.
There are many Chola inscriptions in the temple, both in Tamil and Sanskrit. These are attributed to Rajendra Chola I (1012-1044 CE), Kulothunga Chola I (1070-1120 CE), Vikrama Chola (1118-1135 CE), Rajadhiraja Chola II (1163 -1178 CE), Kulothunga Chola III (1178-1218 CE) and Rajaraja Chola III (1216-1256 CE). Pandya inscriptions date from Thribhuvana Chakravarthi Veerapandiyan, Jataavarman Thribhuvana Chakravarthi Sundarapaandiyan (1251-1268 CE) and Maaravarman Thribhuvana Chakravarthi Veerakeralanaagiya Kulashekara Pandiyan (1268-1308 CE). Pallava inscriptions are available for king Avani Aala Pirandhaan Ko-pperum-Singha (1216-1242 CE). Vijayanagara Kings mentioned in inscriptions are Veeraprathaapa Kiruttina Theva Mahaaraayar (1509-1529 CE), Veeraprathaapa Venkata Deva Mahaaraayar, Sri Ranga Theva Mahaaraayar, Atchyutha Deva Mahaaraayar (1529-1542 CE) and Veera Bhooopathiraayar. One of the inscriptions from the descendant of Cheramaan Perumal nayanar, Ramavarma Maharaja has been found.
Ratha/Chariot.
The Chidambaram Ratha is used for processions twice a year, where it is drawn by several thousand devotees during the festivals.
Significance of the architecture.
The temple sanctum contains a silver sculpture of Shiva in his Ānanda-tāṇḍava Nataraja aspect. It signifies:
Bhakti movement.
There is no reference to the temple in Sangam literature of the 1st to 5th centuries and the earliest mention is found in 6th-century Tamil literature. The temple and the deity were immortalized in Tamil poetry in the works of "Thevaram" by three poet saints belonging to the 7th century - Thirugnana Sambanthar, Thirunavukkarasar and Sundaramoorthy Nayanar. Thirugnana Sambanthar has composed 2 songs in praise of the temple, Thirunavukkarasar aka Appar 8 Tevarams in praise of Nataraja and Sundarar 1 song in praise of Nataraja. Sundarar commences his "Thiruthondar thogai" (the sacred list of Lord Shiva's 63 devotees) paying his respects to the priests of the Thillai temple - "To the devotees of the priests at Thillai, I am a devotee". The works of the first three saints, Thirumurai were stored in palm leaf manuscripts in the temple and were recovered by the Chola King Rajaraja Chola under the guidance of Nambiandarnambi.
Manikkavasagar, the 10th-century "saivite" poet has written two works, the first called Tiruvasakam (The sacred utterances) which largely has been sung in Chidambaram and the "Thiruchitrambalakkovaiyar" (aka Thirukovaiyar), which has been sung entirely in the temple. Manikkavasagar is said to have attained spiritual bliss at Chidambaram. The Chidambaram Mahatmiyam composed during the 12th century explain the subsequent evolution and de-sanskritization.
Rituals.
A unique feature of this temple is the bejewelled image of Lord Nataraja as the main deity. It depicts Lord Shiva as the master of Koothu-Bharata Natyam and is one of the few temples where Lord Shiva is represented by an anthropomorphic murthi rather than the classic, aniconic Lingam.
At Chidambaram, the dancer dominates, not the linga as in other Shiva shrines. The Chitsabha houses a small Spatika Lingam (Chandramoulisvara), believed to be a piece that fell from the crescent adorning Lord Shiva's head and installed by Adi Shankara. Daily puja is offered to the spatik linga (six times) and also to a small Ruby figure of Nataraja called Ratnasabhapati (once, at 10-30 am).
The main sanctum also encloses Chidambara Rahasya - the divine chakra adorned with golden bilva leaves. This remains hidden, and only during the pooja times (six times a day) Rahasya Darshan will be offered to the devotees.
Rahasya emanates the vastness and formlessness of Akash, the divinity that is the highest form of Supremacy (ether form of five elements).
Festivals.
A whole year for men is said to be a single day for the gods. Just as six poojas are performed in a day at the sanctum sanctorum, six anointing ceremonies are performed for the principal deity – Nataraja in a year.
They are the Marghazhi Thiruvaadhirai (in December–January) indicating the first puja, the fourteenth day after the new moon (Chaturdashi) of the month of Masi (February–March) indicating the second pooja, the Chittirai Thiruvonam (in April–May), indicating the third pooja or uchikalam, the Uthiram of Aani (June–July) also called the Aani Thirumanjanam indicating the evening or the fourth puja, the chaturdasi of Aavani (August–September) indicating the fifth puja and the chaturdasi of the month of Puratasi (October–November) indicating the sixth pooja or Arthajama. Of these the Marghazhi Thiruvaadhirai (in December–January) and the Aani Thirumanjanam (in June–July) are the most important. These are conducted as the key festivals with the main deity being brought outside the sanctum sanctorum in a procession that included a temple car procession followed by a long anointing ceremony. Several hundreds of thousands of people flock the temple to see the anointing ceremony and the ritualistic dance of Shiva when he is taken back to the sanctum sanctorum. Lord Shiva, in his incarnation of Nataraja, is believed to have been born on full moon day in the constellation of "Ardra", the sixth lunar mansion. Lord Shiva is bathed only 6 times a year, and on the previous night of "Ardra", the bath rituals are performed on a grand scale. Pots full of milk, pomegranate juices, coconut water, ghee, oil, sandal paste, curds, holy ashes, and other liquids and solids, considered as sacred offering to the deity are used for the sacred ablution.
Administration.
The temple was originally administered by an exclusive group of Brahmins who were called the "Thillai Muvayiravar" or the "Three Thousand of Thillai". They were originally the ritual arbiters of imperial legitimacy in the Chola Empire, ritually crowning successive Chola monarchs. Kulottunga Chola I, during his rule, introduced priests from Vengi, his original homeland to perpetuate the myth of the "Tillai three thousand" in order to legitimize his royal and priestly power. Currently, the temple is managed by a community known as Dikshitars. They live in Chidambaram and also serve as the hereditary trustees of the temple. Every Dikshitar once he is married becomes as of right a trustee and "archaka" of the temple. A practice unique to the community is that the priests wear the tuft of hair in front of the head similar to the Nambuthiri Brahmans of Kerala.

Thruxton Aerodrome

Thruxton Aerodrome is located in Thruxton, west of Andover, in Hampshire, England.
The airfield was opened in 1942 as RAF Thruxton. Postwar, it was reopened by the Wiltshire School of Flying in 1947, and private and club flying operations continue to the present time.
Thruxton Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number UKEGHO-001) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee, Thruxton Circuit Limited.
Motorbike racing began on a track using the runways and perimeter roads in 1950. Thruxton Circuit, which follows the line of the perimeter road, has been used for motorbike and car racing since 1968.
Many air cadets were trained here on Flying Scholarships and gained their PPLs. The training was carried out by the Wiltshire School of Flying on DH.82 Tiger Moth and Jackaroo aircraft.
From 1959 until April 2024 the aerodrome was operated by Western Air (Thruxton) Limited. Ownership of the aerodrome and surrounding site then passed to Thruxton Circuit Limited.
Parachuting.
In the 1960s, the airfield was the headquarters of the British Skydivers Club.
On Sunday September 1964, 23 year old Peter Banner, of Beverley Road, in Barnes, fell 8,000ft, when his main chute failed to open. His parents were from Wiltshire. He was the last of six to jump from a de Havilland Dragon.
On Sunday 6 November 1966, 22 year Kenneth Barnaby Smith fell 2,500 ft, to land on the grass verge of the A303 road, when his chute failed to open.
In June and July 1983, around 2,300 jumps were made; 1,800 jumps had been made in June, July and August 1982. But by the summer of 1983, orthopaedic consultants, such as Francis Moynihan, at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital viewed the number of parachutist injuries, from Thruxton, as excessive. It was taking up hospital beds. One parachutist, a male aged 62, lost a leg, and others had major fractures. The parachute club was closed in 1984, after a series of accidents.
After an accident 9 August 1987 at 12.20pm, with an Islander aircraft, and helicopter G-BALE, Labour MP Terry Fields wanted to ban charity parachute jumps, and Conservative MP Anthony Beaumont-Dark wanted more registration.
Incidents.
On Friday 11 August 1995 a Beechcraft Baron G-BAHN taking off for Deauville crashed nearby at Fyfield, Hampshire.
 Two Squadron Leaders, husband and wife aged 36, and another officer, aged 44, from RAF Uxbridge were killed, with a Major, aged 36, from the 47th Regiment Royal Artillery.

Walney Aerodrome

Walney Aerodrome (formerly RAF Walney Island) is located on Walney Island, northwest of the centre of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England. The airport is owned by BAE Systems, who operate private communication flights to locations across the United Kingdom and expanded the airport with new infrastructure and terminal buildings in 2019.
History.
Work on the construction of RAF Walney by Laing Construction began in 1940, though the site had been used as an airship station since the First World War. Designated as an Air Gunnery School, three runways were constructed, laid out in a triangular arrangement, for use by the based Royal Air Force flying units. Upon completion of Walney's airfield No. 25 Group RAF became the first group to take up post, followed a number of weeks later by a small group who were to form No. 3 Air Gunnery School.
Subsequently, the airfield was designated as No. 10 Air Gunnery School which came into being in October 1941, initially comprising 100 personnel, and was one of several situated around the coastline of the Irish Sea, which provided an ideal location for such training.
No. 10 Air Gunnery School.
With the specialised aircrew required for the heavy bombers of Bomber Command, air gunners became a separate category. Each bomber required two or three gunners in its crew, so thousands were needed for the growing strategic offensive and to replace losses.
RAF Walney played an important role in the training programme, and thus began the busiest period in the life of the station. The school opened with 10 Westland Lysanders based on the station, providing towing aircraft for the target drones. There were also two Boulton Paul Defiants to provide airborne practice. By December 1941 there were 17 Defiants on the station, and there was accommodation for 100 officers, 140 sergeants and 1,200 airmen.
Whilst at Walney, the volunteer trainee air gunners underwent an intensive course before passing on to the operational training units of Bomber Command. Two types of courses were run from the Station: an 18-month course for wireless operators/air gunners, and a 6-month course for air gunners.
The courses involved sighting; aircraft recognition; pyrotechnics; clay-pigeon and 25 yard range shoots; care and maintenance of .303 and .5 Browning machine guns and 20mm cannon; turret hydraulics, manipulation and operation, and the use of cine-camera guns. The training huts were equipped with the various types of turrets then in use, including Boulton Paul Types A and F, and Frazer Nash 121.
By 1943 the Boulton Paul Defiants were becoming obsolete, mainly because only one student and one instructor could fly at a time. So the Defiants were replaced by Avro Ansons, much more suited to the task, and by the end of 1943 over 5,000 trainees had passed through RAF Walney. 
Training continued through 1944 and into 1945, by which time the Avro Ansons began to be replaced by the Vickers Wellington, which was equipped with two turrets and camera guns, thereby offering more efficient training. In addition Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires were introduced to provide more realistic targets. During the latter part of 1945 the RAF Mountain Rescue Unit arrived at Walney from RAF Cark.
In 1946 No. 10 Air Gunnery School relocated to RAF Mona, and by the end of the year all flying based at RAF Walney had ceased. The Air Training Corps No. 188 Gliding School RAF from RAF Cark arrived at Walney and continued to use the airfield until 1955, when RAF Walney closed.
Post-war.
The airfield was sold on in 1959 to Vickers, the company that owned Barrow shipyard. Commercial flights operated from the airport in the late 20th century but ceased in 1992.
Airship construction.
During the early 20th century a site 1 mile south west of the airport was used for one of the UK's most important airship production facilities. For a brief period, the industry was as important for the local economy as Barrow's booming ship building industry. Between 1910 and 1920, such airships as No. 9r, R80, and the SS class blimp were constructed by Vickers, Sons and Maxim for the British Royal Navy at Walney, having relocated from alongside Cavendish Dock in Barrow.
Commercial era.
Commercial flights used the airport during the 1980s and 1990s. Air Ecosse flew to Edinburgh, Carlisle and Liverpool from 1982 until 1983 using Twin Otter aircraft. Air Furness commenced scheduled passenger flights from the airport in 1984, flying predominantly to Manchester. The flights were designed to connect with international services from Manchester and were operated up to four times daily using Islander aircraft. Air Furness ceased operations in 1988. Despite a final attempt to run scheduled services from the airport in 1991–1992 by Telair, the airport is currently used only for private flights.
21st century and expansion proposals.
In 2004 a study into the airport indicated that a £1 million upgrade would attract thousands of business passengers a year flying to London and Europe. The study found that the business demand from South Cumbria would be equal to 4,500 journeys in a year, reaching 7,900 by 2020. Conversion of the airport into an international airport is only at a planning stage, but already the number of aircraft using the airfield has increased with the completion of an upgrade programme, including instrument landing system (ILS) installation for runway 35, resurfacing and re-lighting of runway 17/35, security fencing around the entire airfield and other improvements such as signage.
In 2005, an airshow was held at the site. Following its success a second was planned for 2007 but was later cancelled.
In 2016 BAE Systems submitted plans to Barrow Borough Council to redevelop and expand parts of the airport by constructing a new terminal and air traffic control tower, hangar, garage for support vehicles including a fire engine, a new car park and upgraded roadway and an aircraft apron. In the same year Ørsted proposed the construction of a heliport, additional hangar and associated office buildings. The latter however pursued an alternative location off Park Road, Sowerby Woods which was granted a 5-year permission to operate. This was closed shortly after opening due to lack of demand. BAE completed much of their expansion in 2018 and the new development was officially opened on 3 September 2019 by Rear Admiral Paul Methven DSMA.
The airport still has three runways with only two in present operation - 17/35 and 05/23. 11/29 is not currently in use as a runway.
Aircraft.
BAE Systems operates flights to UK destinations during the week, using four Beechcraft King Air B200 aircraft that are registered on the Isle of Man civil aircraft register as M-CDBM, M-CDJC, M-CDMS and M-LENR. This includes a twice-a-day shuttle to Farnborough, a three-times-a-day shuttle to Bristol and a twice daily shuttle to East Midlands.
The Lakes Gliding Club operated from the aerodrome at weekends until July 2023.
Airlines and destinations.
Below are the destinations flown to by the BAE corporate shuttle.
Accidents and incidents.
On 26 November 1976, a Piper PA-31 Navajo from Edinburgh Airport was making its final approach to the airport. Due to adverse weather conditions and a poorly lit runway, the plane hit an embankment alongside the Walney Channel, killing the pilot and seriously injuring two passengers.

Beccles Airfield

Beccles Airfield, also known as Beccles Airport or Beccles Aerodrome , is located southeast of Beccles in the county of Suffolk, England. Built during the Second World War, it has operated as a heliport servicing the North Sea oil and gas industry and currently operates as a base for private flights, flight training and parachuting.
Beccles Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P837) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (RainAir (Beccles) Limited). The aerodrome is not licensed for night use. The current airstrip consists of around of the original wartime concrete surface with of grass airstrip.
Origin and wartime use.
Always known locally as Ellough Airfield, Beccles airfield was built under the direction of London construction company Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts for the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and completed in August 1942. It used the three concrete runway layout typical of many bomber airfields in East Anglia, known as Class A layout, and was built for the 8th Air Force and allocated airfield number 132. It is possible that Ellough was intended to be used by the 3d Air Division, 95th Combat Bombardment Wing. The 95th had two Bombardment Groups, the 489th at RAF Halesworth and the 491st at RAF Metfield. Other combat wings had three Bomber Groups.
The airfield was the last to be completed in Suffolk during the war and the USAAF had no use for the airfield so it passed briefly to RAF Bomber Command before being operated by No. 16 Group RAF, RAF Coastal Command from August 1944. The field was used as an air-sea rescue post until closure in 1945, and saw operation by various RAF and FAA squadrons operating such diverse types as Vickers Warwick, Fairey Barracuda, Supermarine Walrus, Fairey Swordfish, Supermarine Sea Otter and Fairey Albacore on air-sea rescue and anti-shipping duties. The Fleet Air Arm used temporary lodging facilities at RAF Beccles under the stone frigate name "HMS Hornbill II".
One of Ellough's few claims to fame is that in 1943 it was used by de Havilland Mosquitos of 618 Squadron to practise dropping spinning bombs called 'Highball' which were a derivative of the bouncing bombs used by 617 "Dambuster" Squadron to breach dams in Germany in May 1943. The use of 'Highball' is shown in the 1970 film "Mosquito Squadron". In an interview late in his life, Captain (N) "Winkle" Brown, the first person to land a Mosquito on an aircraft carrier, recalls visiting the airfield to demonstrate deck landing skills to RAF personnel there. In the course of his visit, he encountered Barnes Wallis, designer of the bouncing bombs.
The wartime control tower was demolished in 2009. The airfield was the most easterly wartime airfield in England.
Units.
The site was used by different units:
Post-war use.
After the war the airfield remained dormant until 1965 when BEA Helicopters moved in to the hangars at the eastern end, serving North Sea oil and gas rigs with Sikorsky S-61 helicopters. Helicopter operations were transferred to Norwich International Airport in the 1990s. The airfield has been home to RainAir since 1997 when Rainer Forster transferred his flight training operations from Swanton Morley. The airfield is the base for No. 28 (Suffolk) Civil Air Patrol Unit, a volunteer organisation which aims to aid the emergency services. UK Parachuting carry out free-fall parachute training from the airfield, Virage Helicopter Academy conduct Helicopter training and Mid Anglia Microlights carry out Microlight flying training in both 3-axis (fixed wing) and weightshift machines. Since early 2016 Skylark Radio Control Flyers have been authorised to fly their models at the airfield operating from the concrete runway 09/27 in close cooperation with Rain Air operations.
Other uses.
Most of the runways have been broken up and much of the area of the airfield is now used for a variety of industrial uses. Beccles printing company William Clowes Ltd. moved their main factory to the site in 2004. Plastics company Promens operates a warehouse on the park which has the UK's largest solar roof installation with a generating capacity of 1.65MW. Large solar farms are located at the west and south points of the airfield.
Other areas of the site are used for agricultural use and as a site for a farmers market. A kart circuit, Ellough Park Raceway, also occupies part of the airfield site.

Bodmin Airfield

Bodmin Airfield is located northeast of Bodmin, Cornwall, England, UK.
Radio equipped microlights can use Bodmin (radio contact preferred). All aircraft are strictly on Prior Permission Required basis.
History.
Bodmin Airfield was a dream come true for a local business man, Mike Robertson, founder of Trago Mills. He wanted to make aviation available to everyone. In pursuit of this dream, local engineers, The Dingle Brothers were commissioned to construct the airfield on what was once known as Treswithick Farm. In 1972, the airfield was bought by the Cornwall Flying Club, which, in turn, became a limited company, Cornwall Flying Club Ltd, in 1978. In keeping with the original ideals and dreams of its creator, Cornwall Flying Club operates as a non-profit organisation, to keep costs down for the end user.
Trago Mills Ltd. (Aviation Division) designed and built the Trago Mills SAH-1 in the early 1980s here. The SAH-1 derived its name from its designer, Sydney A. Holloway. It was hoped that the Trago Mills SAH-1 would be sold as a military trainer to replace the then ageing "Bulldog" fleet.
About.
Bodmin airfield is situated on the edge of Bodmin Moor, Cornwall, just off the main A30 dual carriageway. It is operated by the Cornwall Flying Club and has a clubhouse, a lunchtime bar and a restaurant. CFC Ltd. has five instructors and four aircraft, including two Van's Aircraft RV-12, a Cessna 172 and a Cessna 152. The airfield is also home to Cornwall Aviation Services, an aircraft maintenance business.

Caernarfon Airport

 
Caernarfon Airport () , is a general aviation airport located southwest of Caernarfon, Gwynedd, Wales. It is on the site of the former RAF Llandwrog which was operational between 1941 and 1946. From the end of the 1960s, civil light aircraft started to use the aerodrome in greater numbers and eventually gained a full operating licence in 1976.
Operations.
Caernarfon Aerodrome has a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Ordinary Licence (Number P866) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers, or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Air Caernarfon Limited). The aerodrome is not licensed for night use. The airport has a single licensed runway: 07/25. There is also an unlicensed runway: 02/20, and a disused runway (was 14/32). These initially formed a triangle layout, commonly used during the Second World War.
The airport is mainly used by small fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and microlights. Several companies based at the airport offer flight training. North Wales Flight Academy offers fixed-wing training for the issue of a PPL (A) and other fixed-wing qualifications. Microlight traffic forms a considerable part of the local aerodrome traffic and flight training is provided by The Microlight School. Helicopter training is also undertaken at the airport by Geo Helicopters. It is also possible to have pleasure flights and charters from the airport. There is also a helicopter simulator located inside the Caernarfon Airworld Aviation Museum.
Search and Rescue.
In 2013, the Department for Transport (DfT) handed out the contract to manage search and rescue for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency during the next ten years to Bristow Helicopters, using two Sikorsky S-92 helicopters. Since 1 July 2015, search and rescue operations have commenced at Caernarfon Airport.
Wales Air Ambulance.
The airfield is now one of the homes for the Wales Air Ambulance. The HEMS (Helicopter Emergency Medical Service) operates the Airbus Helicopters H145, a twin-engined light utility helicopter from Caernarfon. The helicopters are leased and are operated on behalf of the charity by Babcock Mission Critical Services Onshore.
Facilities.
During the 2000s, the airport underwent significant re-development and expansion. At the aerodrome, there is a large café, a maintenance and storage hangar, and a visitor centre and shop which are part of the Aviation Museum at the site.
History.
The airfield opened in July 1941 as a RAF Flying Training Command airfield for training and closed for flying in June 1945. It was built with three runways, all wide, and organised into a triangle: 27/09 , 21/03 and 14/32 . It had two T1 hangars, a single Bellman hangar and six blister hangars along the northern perimeter track. The technical, administration and hospital areas were on the south side of the runways, along with the air traffic control tower and the watch office.
RAF Flying Training Command.
No. 9 Air Gunners School RAF formed in July 1941 at RAF Llandwrog. Almost twelve months later the school disbanded in June 1942. The unit operated the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bomber aircraft for turret training and the Westland Lysander army co-operation and liaison aircraft for target towing, alongside the Fairey Battle light bomber, and the twin-engined, multi-role Avro Anson aircraft from Llandwrog. No. 9 Air Observers School RAF (9 AOS) moved its night-flying course, ‘D’ flight, formed of six Avro Anson aircraft, to RAF Llandwrog from RAF Penrhos, arriving as a lodger unit in January 1942. 9 AOS was later redesignated as No. 9 (Observer) Advanced Flying Unit ((O)AFU), in May 1942. No.9 (O)AFU continued observer training at RAF Llandwrog until disbandment in June 1945.

Carlisle Lake District Airport

Carlisle Lake District Airport is a small airport located north-east of Carlisle, England on a plain near the River Irthing.
Originally opened as an RAF base in 1941, it came under government ownership in the 1960s before being sold to Haughey Airports in 2000 which was later purchased and rebranded as Stobart Air Limited. Stobart Group purchased Carlisle Airport in May 2009 for £9.9 million and constructed a £12 million freight distribution center. In July 2019, a new terminal was opened that briefly connected Carlisle with commercial flights to Belfast, Dublin &amp; London but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, commercial flights ceased operating in April 2020.
Since its partial re-opening post COVID-19, it now operates unlicensed and welcomes general aviation aircraft, as well as being host to several military exercises throughout the year. There is Avgas, JetA1 and F34 fuel available during operating hours.
The airport has been the location for some prehistoric excavations. It also hosts the Solway Aviation Museum. Since 2024, it has been owned and operated by forest products company A.W. Jenkinson.
History.
RAF Crosby-on-Eden.
In the early 1930s, the City of Carlisle County Borough Council opened Kingstown Municipal Airport, at the time outside the borough boundaries which later became RAF Kingstown and is now Kingstown and Kingmoor industrial estates and business parks. With the outbreak of war in 1939, RAF Kingstown's runway was too small for bombers, so the Royal Air Force developed a new airstrip at Crosby-on-Eden to the east of Carlisle, on the line of the Stanegate Roman road. The new facility came into operation in February 1941 for training operations, designating the station RAF Crosby-on-Eden.
Originally housing No. 59 Operational Training Unit, the station provided day training for Hawker Hurricane pilots, which was replaced by No. 9 OTU, 17 Group, Coastal Command in August 1942, for training long-range fighter crews on Bristol Beaufort and Bristol Beaufighter conversion squadrons, as well as air firing and night flying. In August 1944 the station came under the command of 109 OTU, a transport command of Douglas Dakotas. The station was renamed 1383 TCU on 1 August 1945. However, the station had no postwar use or need, and was closed in 1947 with the airfield returning to Carlisle City Council to continue as a municipal airport.
Purchase by the local authorities.
In 1960 Cumberland County Council purchased the site and renamed it Carlisle Airport. After a short refurbishment programme it was licensed in 1961 for training purposes and civilian flights to destinations including London, the Channel Islands, Belfast and the Isle of Man. In 1968 the airport was transferred to Carlisle City Council. Most of the original RAF structures remain intact today, although a lack of investment and maintenance has restricted much of the perimeter road, as well as shortening and weight restricting the runways.
During the early 1980s Carlisle Airport was used by Specialist Flight Training to train military pilots in helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. Notably, the training of Iraqi pilots for the Iran-Iraq War was a key part of the programme. Specialist Flight Training had at least seven Gazelle helicopters which, at the time were registered sequentially from G-SFTA to G-SFTG together with at least two Firecracker fixed wing aircraft registered, at that time, as G-SFTR and G-SFTS.  The trainee pilots had a reputation locally for being slightly reckless with various incidents occurring during the period that Specialist Flight Training were operational at the airport. 
In 1997, the council agreed to extend the runway to allow Boeing 737s to land into a new air-cargo hub, but the proposal collapsed.
Sale to Haughey Airports.
As the airport had lost £3.5 million on operations between 1979 and 1994, Carlisle City Council agreed to sell the airport on a 150-year lease to Haughey Airports in 2000. The company was owned by Northern Irish entrepreneur Edward Haughey, who owned nearby Corby Castle in Cumbria. Haughey invested £4 million in infrastructure improvements but, whilst promising to provide additional facilities and enhancements to the site for the Solway Aviation Museum, he sold the airfield to WA Developments Limited in 2006 before achieving this.
Esken ownership (formerly Stobart Group).
On 7 April 2006, Haughey Airports was acquired by WA Developments, which had acquired Eddie Stobart Ltd. in February 2004. Haughey Airports Ltd was renamed Stobart Air Ltd and a sub-division within WA Developments called Stobart Air was formed. The airport was then re-branded Carlisle Lake District Airport.
Following WA Developments' decision to merge Eddie Stobart with the property and ports company the Westbury Property Fund on 15 August 2007 and to list it on the London Stock Exchange as the Stobart Group, Carlisle Lake District Airport initially remained within the ownership of WA Developments, through its subsidiary Stobart Air Holdings. On 10 March 2008, the Stobart Group entered into a £50,000 option, expiring in July 2008, to acquire Carlisle Lake District Airport from Stobart Air Holdings for £15 million (£2.5 million in cash and £12.5 million in new Stobart Group shares). This option was extended in July 2008 until January 2009 for a further £50,000.
In January 2009, Stobart Group's subsidiary, Stobart Airports Ltd, exercised its option to acquire Carlisle Lake District Airport from Stobart Air Holdings for £14 million (£1 million less than originally announced). Following an independent shareholder vote, the acquisition was completed on 30 May 2009, and the purchase price was reduced to £9.9 million due to a fall in the value of Stobart Group shares.
Between December 2014 and September 2015, a £12 million freight distribution centre was built on the south-eastern corner of the site, which is now leased to Eddie Stobart Logistics. Stobart Group also intended to build a further warehousing and distribution hub from 2017 on land adjacent to the freight distribution centre. After financial assistance from the Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership, there were plans for passenger flights from June 2018 "to major tourism and business hubs including London, Dublin and Belfast" but the target date was postponed. On 4 July 2019 the new terminal was officially opened, and the first scheduled passenger flights since 1993 were commenced by Loganair to Belfast–City, Dublin, London–Southend until 2021.
Esken (Stobart Group) redevelopment plans timeline.
Under Stobart Group ownership between 2006 and 2009, some development was planned for Carlisle Lake District Airport which would have seen the introduction of freight and passenger services in the future, along with the resurfacing of the existing runway to accept larger aircraft as part of a £21 million development. Plans were announced to redevelop the airport site to include a new passenger terminal, an air freight service, a new headquarters for Eddie Stobart, and a distribution centre. Ryanair also expressed an interest in using the completed airport as a hub.
On 4 April 2008 controversy emerged surrounding the proposed developments to Carlisle Lake District Airport. In response to 63 apparently overly restrictive planning conditions placed on the development plans of Stobart Air,
On 7 October at the Cumbria Tourist Board's AGM he confirmed that work at the airport would have begun early 2010 and hoped that flights to Paris, Belfast and Dublin would be in operation by 2011.
On 14 December 2010, Stobart Air submitted proposals to build a Air Freight Distribution Centre on the site. Under the plans, Eddie Stobart Logistics would relocate all its Carlisle depots to the airport, and there would be passenger flights to and from London Southend Airport, operated by Aer Arann which would base an ATR 42 aircraft at Carlisle. Further details on jobs and flights were supplied in support of the application in July 2011.
On 3 August 2012, Stobart Air was given permission by Carlisle City Council to develop the airport under these proposals. These included the raising and reprofiling of the main runway at the airport. The warehousing contracts would deliver the rental income required to help upgrade the airport facilities and allow passenger flights to commence. Aer Arann identified that passenger routes from Carlisle to Dublin and the Stobart-owned London Southend Airport would be sustainable."
Planning approval was subsequently overturned in the High Court in March 2014. On 19 March 2014, Aer Arann changed its name to Stobart Air. Following a change in the law which no longer required Stobart Air to prove that the airport would have to be viable, planning permission was re-granted on 18 August 2014. No application for a judicial review was received and work started on 3 December 2014. This was completed on 7 September 2015.
This first development covers 19 acres, and this site was sold to the real estate investment fund Gramercy Europe for £16.925 million on 22 February 2016.
On 22 November 2016, Stobart Group announced it was developing 21 acres of land adjacent to its existing Air Freight Distribution Centre in an area to be called Eden Park. Eden Park will consist of industrial warehouse and distribution buildings ranging in size from to , and is being marketed as of 2017.
On 1 October 2015, Brampton and Beyond Energy Ltd (BABE) in conjunction with Stobart Energy announced plans to build a £1.5 million anaerobic digester renewable energy plant on a piece of woodland to the west of the site by 2018.
Lakeland Airways.
Start-up airline Lakeland Airways attempted to establish flights from Carlisle in 2021, but later moved its base to Blackpool following the revocation of the airport's commercial licence. The airline would be rebranded as Avooma in 2024.
A W Jenkinson.
In May 2024, the new owners A W Jenkinson announced their plans for the airport.
Business operations.
Carlisle Lake District Airport covers , of which are used for airport-related activities, and the balance of is in the process of being developed for logistics and aviation-related activities.
Its main activity presently provides facilities for flight training and sightseeing flights. The airport is host to these businesses: Carlisle Flight Training and Aero Club, Border Air Training and Northumbria Helicopters.
Solway Aviation Museum occupies a small part of the site.
A lorry driving training company, System Training, is based at Carlisle Airport Business Park, a site opposite Carlisle Lake District Airport, and was featured in Series 2, Episode 7 of the Channel 5 TV programme "", first aired on 30 June 2011. Edd Stobart, the 20-year-old son of Stobart Group Chief Operating Officer William Stobart, passed his HGV Class 2 driving licence using that school.
ECM (Vehicle Delivery Service) Ltd has its HQ at the airport.
In August 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, part of the site was used as a Coronavirus test facility.
Military operations.
Although not present during the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022, the Royal Netherlands Air Force has been holding their annual low flying exercise "Tac Blaze" over the nearby RAF Spadeadam range while based at the airport since 2006. The exercise involves around 400 personnel and aims at training the Dutch Defense Helicopter Command's aircrew and Airmobile Brigade flying missions day and night, over hilly terrain and against real threat systems using Eurocopter AS532 Cougar, Boeing AH-64 Apache and Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters.
Commercial service history.
Although regular scheduled flights from the airport have operated, few have been commercially viable leading to a series of failed operations:

Wartime use.
The airfield was built during the Second World War by the Royal Air Force as a relief landing ground for nearby RAF Tangmere. The site was the former Westhampnett Farm and part of the Goodwood Estate. It was known as RAF Westhampnett.
RAF use.
During the Battle of Britain two fighter squadrons (145 Sqn and 602 Sqn) were based at Westhampnett.
USAAF use.
Westhampnett was also used by the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force as a fighter airfield for the 308th and 309th Fighter Squadrons of the 31st Fighter Group from RAF Atcham and RAF High Ercall with Supermarine Spitfire Vs beginning on 27 July 1942.
The 31st FG flew its first sorties with RAF, (total of 1,286 losing 5 aircraft) on 10 September 1942, and flew last mission from Great Britain in late October 1942. The group then moved to Gibraltar and fought with the Twelfth Air Force in North Africa and Italy.
Postwar use.
After the war the airfield was returned to the Goodwood Estate and the perimeter track of the airfield has been used since the late 1940s for motor racing and called the Goodwood Circuit. The airfield currently has a large flying school and many historic aircraft.

The three-runway airfield was built to replace Burnaston Airfield, which the same Jones family and company had reestablished in 1986 but which was forced to make way for redevelopment of the site as a Toyota manufacturing plant in 1990. Construction of the new ranch begun in 1992, with the Defra Aerodrome Licence being granted in 1993. Two further runways and buildings, including hangars and stables, were added over the years.
Stakeholders.
Airspeed Aviation Ltd is a CAA and EASA Approved Aircraft Maintenance Organisation holding approvals EASA Part M Subpart F (Approval Number UK.MF.0010) and CAA BCAR A8-15 M3 (Approval Number AMR/179). It is also an EASA Approved Continued Airworthiness Management Organisation (CAMO) holding EASA Part M Subpart G and I approvals (Number UK.MG.0308) for a wide range of general aviation aircraft.
The Derby Aero Club, originally located at Burnaston, also moved to the new airfield and continues to grow. The Aero Club and Flying School operates a range of Cessna Aircraft (Models 140, 152, 172, 177RG), a Beagle Pup series 2 and a Scottish Aviation Bulldog aircraft. Numerous private aircraft also are based on site, with many more visiting for maintenance services.
In 2004 the remains of de Havilland DH.88 Comet Racer G-ACSP "Black Magic" arrived for restoration by the Comet Racer Project Group. This Comet was flown in the 1934 MacRobertson England-Australia air race by Jim Mollison and his wife Amy, better known as Amy Johnson. Work on "Black Magic" and G-RCSR, a replica of its teammate G-ACSR, is currently continuing in a purpose-built home, the Amy Johnson Comet Restoration Centre.

History.
There are records that flying has been taking place at Denham Aerodrome since 1915, when during the First World War, RAF Denham was established as a flying training school for Flight Cadets.
The airfield was first licensed as a private use airfield to Squadron Leader J. M. Bickerton by the CAA on 19 May 1938. During the Second World War, the airfield was used again as a training school. The largest based aircraft was a Douglas DC-3 of Gregory Air Services and occasional airshows have been staged here. 
The airfield was the home to one of the earliest parachuting clubs in the UK, starting in 1955 the "British Parachute Club" was based here until May 1956 when they moved to Blackbushe Airport in Hampshire. The club at Denham was run by instructor Dumbo Willans and is known as the first civilian parachuting school in Britain.
A light aircraft was stolen on Sunday 2 November 1980 in the early morning, and flown to Heathrow after 'buzzing' the M4. Heathrow did not detect the aircraft before it landed. The aircraft was owned by Peter John Hunt. Nicholas John Radford, aged 22, of Chalfont St Peter was charged by police in December 1980, for theft and not communicating a flight plan, to the London Central Zone.
Services.
Presently, there are a number of charter and flight instruction and filming operators based at Denham Aerodrome as well as a helicopter maintenance facility.

Panshanger Aerodrome

Panshanger Aerodrome was a former general aviation aerodrome located on the most eastern tip of Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England, west of Hertford, East Hertfordshire.
Wartime history.
During the Second World War, a decoy aerodrome for the de Havilland factory at Hatfield was built on land at Holwell Hyde, just south of Panshanger airfield, and the Royal Air Force occasionally made use of it for training. Panshanger airfield itself was more regularly used by the Royal Air Force for training purposes and a large "Bellman" type hangar was erected to accommodate the aircraft based there. This structure still exists, albeit in a dilapidated condition.
No. 1 Elementary Flying School, equipped with Tiger Moth biplane trainers was active at the aerodrome from September 1942. No. 127 Gliding School was operational at Panshanger from August 1943 until closure in May 1948.
After the war, No. 1 Reserve Flying School was based at Panshanger from May 1947 until its closure in May 1953. It was managed by De Havilland Aircraft.
Postwar operations.
From 1946, the airfield was used by flying clubs for training and recreational flying, and also by private owner pilots. A small arched hangar with canvas end closures was in use by 1953.
During its time of operation, Panshanger Aerodrome had a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Ordinary Licence (Number P782) that allowed flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee. The aerodrome was not licensed for night use.
The aerodrome was once home to the North London Flying School (a trading name of East Herts Flying School), which offered Fixed-Wing PPL, instructor and aerobatics training. The school used Piper Cherokee aircraft for most of its training, although it also owned a Piper J-3 (Cub), an Extra 300L and a Piper PA-32R (Saratoga) for other training and hire purposes.
De Havilland apprentices were offered subsidised flying training at Panshanger from 1949 to 1952 on Tiger Moths and Chipmunks.
Aerodrome under threat.
The aerodrome had been under threat from a planning proposal to build 700 houses on the site following the expiry of the lease. Many hundreds of local residents, pilots, aviation organisations and members of the North London Flying Club were against the proposal which ended its public consultation on 31 January 2014. A HM Government e-Petition against the plans was set up but failed to attract enough signatures to move to debate.
Aerodrome closure.
The aerodrome closed on 20 September 2014 following the expiry of the lease from the land owner, who intended to re-designate the use of the land for other purposes. The flying school and restaurant also closed.
There have been efforts to have it re-opened, with campaigners aiming to convince the council that the aerodrome was a great economic and social asset.
A potential reprieve was reported on 28 July 2016. After strong representations, the local Council hope to pursue a mixed use option, with general aviation activities alongside a smaller number of new houses on part of the airfield site.

Shobdon Airfield

Shobdon Airfield is an airport south of Shobdon village, and west of Leominster, Herefordshire, England.
RAF Shobdon.
Shobdon started as a British Army camp. It acted as a reception point for casualties received from Southampton being distributed to local hospitals. With a depot railway station developed on the Leominster and Kington Railway, its first casualties arrived after the Battle of Dunkirk.
The camp was developed further by the United States Army from 1943, to act as a distribution point for two locally developed general hospitals. They also added a runway in co-operation with the Royal Air Force, but due to the marshy land only one runway was developed.
In 1943, RAF No. 1 Glider Training School moved from RAF Thame to Shobdon, enabling an increase in training of glider pilots in preparation for Normandy and Arnhem landings.
The RAF Gliding School closed in 1953, when the site was handed to Herefordshire County Council.
Today.
Shobdon Airfield has a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Ordinary Licence (Number P779) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Herefordshire Aero Club Limited).

Woodford Aerodrome

Woodford Aerodrome is a former airfield and aircraft factory at Woodford, Greater Manchester, England, north of Macclesfield. It was opened by the Avro company after the First World War and became an important production centre for military aircraft in the Second World War. Notable planes made at the factory include the Avro Anson, Avro Lancaster, Avro Shackleton and Avro Vulcan.
After almost 80 years of aircraft manufacture at the site, Woodford was closed and sold off by BAE Systems in 2011.
History.
Pre-war.
The aerodrome opened in 1924 when successful aviation pioneer Alliott Verdon-Roe bought the original farmland to enable his Avro company to move its aeroplane assembly and test flying facilities from Alexandra Park Aerodrome in south Manchester. Originally it had a small grass landing area with several temporary Bessonneau hangars. The Lancashire Aero Club also used the aerodrome briefly in the 1920s until moving to the new Barton Aerodrome and used a converted farm building as a clubhouse and a 'Dutch barn' style steel-framed hangar built for A V Roe around 1927.
By the late 1930s, the aerodrome was upgraded with the construction of concrete runways; the main runway was also extended to the east. Increased factory space, particularly at the northern edge of the aerodrome next to Woodford village, was constructed to allow vast expansion of aircraft production. During the Second World War, the Avro Lancaster was constructed at the site.
Post war.
In 1945, Hawker-Siddeley bought into Avro Canada. Avro continued to be operating name at Woodford but it was actually a subsidiary of the Hawker Siddeley Group and used only for trading purposes. When the company was absorbed into Hawker Siddeley Aviation in July 1963, the Avro name ceased to be used.
On 29 April 1977, Woodford was taken over by British Aerospace. It was formed as a result of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 (c. 3) when Hawker Siddeley Aviation and Dynamics were nationalised and merged with British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) and Scottish Aviation.
Final years.
Woodford became part of BAE Systems as a result of the £7.7 billion merger of British Aerospace (BAe) and Marconi Electronic Systems (MES) in November 1999. The aerodrome and factory became known as BAE Systems Woodford until it was sold in late 2011. The site was due to close anyway in 2012 when its Nimrod project was to be completed but in late 2010 the Woodford-built BAE Nimrod MRA4 project was cancelled. It was previously believed that some jobs would be transferred to BAE Systems' Military Air Solutions headquarters in Preston, Lancashire. However, following the cancellation of aircraft orders in the British Government's Strategic Defence and Security Review, the site closed as an active airfield on 25 August 2011.
On 20 December 2011, the site was purchased for £100 million by Jo Bamford, the heir to the JCB fortune.
A new housing estate called Woodford Garden Village was constructed on the site.
The Avro Heritage Museum now occupies the former aerodrome fire station.
Aircraft types.
Many aircraft types have been built at Woodford, apart from the BAe 146, also first flown at Woodford including:

Newtownards Airport

Newtownards Aerodrome is a local airfield in Newtownards, County Down, Northern Ireland, east of Belfast. It offers light aircraft flights (operated by the Ulster Flying Club), helicopter flights (operated by HeliPower), microlight flights (operated by NI Microlights) and flight simulator training (by AlphaTech). The airport also has an onsite restaurant.
Newtownards Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (number P659) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Ulster Flying Club (1961) Limited).
Airfield history and operations.
Newtownards Airfield opened in August 1934 and until the construction of Sydenham airfield (at Belfast Harbour, later a full airport) in March 1938, was served by UK scheduled internal passenger and mail flights.
The following Royal Air Force units were here at some point under RAF Newtownards:
Ulster Flying Club.
The airfield is the home base of the Ulster Flying Club (UFC). The club was founded in 1961 and grew to become Northern Ireland's largest flying school and one of the largest, non-commercial training and flying organisations in Northern Ireland. The club manages the airfield's facilities. The clubhouse is open to the public for snacks and for viewing activities at the airfield; a new clubhouse was opened in 2005 after the destruction of the last clubhouse by a fire in 2004. Many private pilot owners and self-build constructors base their aircraft in the several hangars on the airfield.
The Ulster Flying Club has continued to develop as a centre for private flying and so the ends of existing runways were re-surfaced and the grass strip tarmacked. The Ulster Flying Club has allowed the airfield to be used for various events including air display days and motorsport events.
The Ulster Flying Club provides both leisure flights and flight training for those who wish to pursue a pilot's licence. The club operates a fleet of five fixed wing aircraft, consisting of two Cessna 172 SPs, one Cessna 152, one Ikarus C42 and one CZAW SportCruiser, 
One aircraft was involved in a fatal crash in April 2018.
Recently added new PAPI lights on runway 21/03 and lights on runway 15/33 have allowed the airfield and UFC to safely carry out night flying and flying in bad visibility.
A report dated 18 May 2023 by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch into the fatal crash on 19 July 2022 of Aeroprakt A32 Vixxen, G-ENVV highlighted multiple concerns and failings regarding the operation of the airfield and an apparent cavalier attitude to safety procedures by some pilots and the operating committee.
Radio frequencies.
The airfield operates an A/G service and until 25 October 2018 the frequency was 128.300mHz; it has since moved to an 8.33 channel and is now 128.305
Fixed Base Operators.
Formed in 2019, the Ards Model Flying Club operates from premises at the Western side of the Airfield. The club participates in all disciplines of radio controlled aircraft flying and is affiliated to the British Model Flying Association.
HeliPower operates leisure and charter flights as well as helicopter fight training for the PPL (H) pilot licence. They operate several rotary aircraft including Robinson R22, R44 and Bell Jet Ranger.
NI Microlights is an independent flight school operating from the airfield. They offer a range of Microlight services including NPPL tuition and trial flights, flight tests, aircraft sales, servicing, permits and repairs. Training is carried out on the Thruster T600 Sprint (fixed wing) and the P&amp;M GT450 (flexwing). 
AlphaTech carry out flight simulator training for the Airbus A320 series of aircraft. They operate a fixed base simulator training device, which is used for professional pilot flight training, SimPilot training and flight experiences.
Aircraft maintenance for permit and vintage aircraft is carried out by a small group of aircraft engineers based in the O'Neill hangar. Annual permit inspections, kit build projects, routine maintenance, engine and airframe repairs are carried out by inspectors approved by the Light Aircraft Association (LAA) and the British Microlight Aircraft Association (BMAA).

Seething Airfield

Seething Airfield , formerly RAF Seething, is located south southeast of Norwich, East Anglia, England.
Seething Airfield (EGSJ) is a privately owned airfield in Norfolk, England and is home to the Waveney Flying Group. Situated in the village of Mundham, paradoxically just outside of Seething, south east of Norwich and just a few miles from the East Coast. The aerodrome is officially open to visitors Saturdays and Sundays from 0900 to around 1700 hrs (sunset in winter).
Founded in 1960, the Waveney Flying Group leased the former United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) airbase from local farmers, and went on to purchase the land in 1963. Its close proximity to Great Yarmouth meant it saw quite a bit of celebrity use in the 60s and 70s when stars such as The Hollies, The Rolling Stones and Mike and Bernie Winters dropped in. In latter years, the new millennium has seen both the club house and hangars developed culminating with their official opening by Wing Cdr. Ken Wallis MBE in 2001.

Old Buckenham Airfield

Old Buckenham Airfield , formerly RAF Old Buckenham, is located southwest of Norwich, East Anglia, England.
Old Buckenham Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P907) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Buckenham Aviation Centre Limited). The aerodrome is not licensed for night use.
History.
The airfield was under Air Ministry control as a satellite for maintenance units until it was closed on 20 June 1960. After a period of uncertainty about the airfield's future, it was announced on 23 August 2011 by the "Eastern Daily Press" that the airfield was under new management. In previous years the then operating company had reported a consistent loss-making position, caused by the economic downturn. At this time the airfield manager changed to Matt Wilkins, a property consultant retained by the owners.
It was announced on 2 July 2013 that the airfield had been sold to a company belonging to local aviation enthusiast, Geoffrey Lynch, by Morgan Stanley for an undisclosed price. Morgan Stanley had become the owners when they purchased the portfolio of loans which owned the airfield from the Irish National Asset Management Agency. Wilkins was retained by Lynch following the purchase and continues to manage the airfield. Lynch has stated that he intends for the airfield to continue in use and plans expansions.
Three new hangars and additional office space were built in 2013/14. Two new Nissen huts, housing a Museum and Facilities Block, were built in 2015. A two-storey office building followed in 2017
Electric Flight.
The airfield was the first in the UK to install and commission an electric aircraft charging point, available for public use from July 2021, and is the home of the NUNCATS project which is testing a prototype electric CH750, with a production version intended for use in the developing world, powered by a network of solar chargers at small unmade landing strips. The factory is planned to be based in a World War 2 building at the airfield. The charger and project have been the subject of an official visit by Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport Robert Courts.
Old Buckenham Airshow.
In December 2011 it was announced that the Old Buckenham Airshow would return in 2012. The show had not gone ahead in 2011 due to the financial climate and management issues. It was later confirmed that the headline act would be the Old Flying Machine Company Spitfire and Mustang Duo of MH434 and Mustang "Ferocious Frankie" both of which belonged to the late Ray Hanna.
The airfield management declared the 2012 Airshow a success and announced that the Airshow would once again become an annual event. On 25 October 2012, it was announced that the 2013 Airshow would be a two-day event. Subsequent announcements from the airfield indicated that the main acts would be the return of the Spitfire and Mustang Duo, together with a World Record attempt by Brendan O'Brien. O'Brien was attempting a new world record; the shortest distance truck top landing recorded. Wind conditions on the day meant that O'Briens chances of success were slim and he came within inches of achieving his goal on the 5th attempt. On landing, it was agreed that the record would be attempted again in 2014.
The 2014 Airshow took place on 26 and 27 July 2014. The Airshow was the lead item on the second bulletin of Mustard TV, a recently launched terrestrial TV channel for the greater Norwich area. The 2014 show was declared a success and described as the "Biggest yet"
The 2015 Airshow was announced in the press on 17 September 2014. The Airshow featured the reunion of Honor Blackman who played Pussy Galore in the James Bond film Goldfinger with the Hiller Aircraft UH12 Helicopter G-ASAZ which she starred with in the movie.
The 2016 and 2017 Airshow were reported as being a success and featured Sally B.
Tourism Award.
The Old Buckenham Airshow was named the EDPHoseasons "Family Event of the Year" in 2016.
War memorial.
The memorial consists of a large stone of black granite, carved into the form of a tailplane from the Consolidated B-24 Liberators which were based at the airfield and was installed on 29 July 1990.
In October 2012 work started to relocate the memorial stone commemorating the 366 USAAF personnel who died serving from RAF Old Buckenham. The new garden was officially opened by Pat Ramm who officiated at the Remembrance Sunday service attended by over 400 people.
The memorial garden features flagpoles which usually fly two American Flags. During large events and Remembrance Sunday the poles fly a large American Flag and Union Jack. The memorial stone is at the end of a path cut in the form of a figure 8 to symbolise the Eighth Air Force. The figure 8 path is made from large blue slate chippings. A commemorative plaque at its base reads "This Memorial Garden was opened on 11 November 2012 by Pat Ramm. It was created by Shaun Hindle, Steve Garrett, Scott Cooper, Lee Belcher &amp; Matt Wilkins"
In 2013 the airfield changed its logo to a shield, originally carved by a serving USAAF officer during World War II. The shield appears on the War Memorial and is now used by the airfield in all its activities. The memorial is described by the airfield as being the main focal point of the airfield. The airfield management have said that they are fostering links with Memorial Groups in the United States.
453rd Bomb Group Museum.
In February 2015, it was announced that the airfield has applied for permission to erect a museum at the site. The plans are for the erection of two Nissen Huts, one of which will house items described as having the potential to be the largest collection of 453rd Bomb Group memorabilia in existence.
The 453rd Bombardment Group Museum opened on Remembrance Sunday 2015.
The 8th Air Force Heritage Gallery.
An additional Museum was opened on Remembrance Sunday 2017 by United States Navy Captain (United States O-6) Poston, whose Great Uncle served in the 453rd Bombardment Group at RAF Old Buckenham. The new museum covers the wider subject of the Eighth Air Force of which the 453rd were a part.
Military &amp; Vintage Revival &amp; Battlefront Military Museum.
In June 2012 Battlefront, The East England Military Museum, moved to hangars at Old Buckenham Airfield. Their base at the airfield contains over 5,000 exhibits, currently not on display to the public. In October 2012 it was announced that the airfield and museum would collaborate on a new show called Military Revival Promotional videos were released, showing a Citroen Van being destroyed by a FV180 Combat Engineer Tractor and a lawn mower being flattened by an unexploded World War II German bomb.
The first Military Revival took place on 5 and 6 October it was announced that the show would be run again in 2014. Following Military Revival, it was announced that several of the main exhibits would be placed on permanent public display at the airfield by Battlefront. Machines on display include a Russian T-55 tank which was used in the 1995 James Bond film "GoldenEye", a Multiple Launch Rocket System and a MGM-52 Lance nuclear missile.
The 2014 Military Revival event was deemed a success, and it was confirmed that the show would run again in 2015, with a joint military and vintage theme.
In January 2015, the airfield confirmed the inclusion of a Vintage theme by announcing a new name for the show, including a new website.
"A Celebration of the Life of Wing Commander Ken Wallis".
On 4 September the airfield announced that it had been asked by the Wallis family to host a day of celebration for Ken Wallis. Wallis had been a regular visitor to the airfield for thirty years, last attending during the 2013 Airshow and had been given lifetime membership as member number 007, celebrating his contribution to the airfield, aviation and marking his appearance as James Bond in "You Only Live Twice" with the autogyro "Little Nellie" which Wallis had designed and built.
The airfield's Blister Hangar was cleared and "Little Nellie" was put on display on a stage in the centre. The rear wall of the hangar featured a 40-foot banner showing pictures from Wallis' life. Local planning regulations were lifted to allow autogyros to fly in. It was anticipated that 500 people would attend but actual attendance was estimated as 3–4,000.
Aero Engineering Centre.
In March 2014 the airfield announced the opening of a new Engineering Centre. The new centre incorporates a CAA Part M Engineering service by The Light Aircraft Company, avionics maintenance by Avitronics, and aircraft painting and interiors by Custom Air.
Tenants and non-aviation activities.
Aircraft engineers, classic car restorers, a race team, aircraft broker and TV company are based at the airfield. There are also areas for TV filming and buildings and land occupied by Battlefront. The airfield operates a fleet of specially modified Honda Gyro Canopy scooters.
The Airfield is also home to a Flight Simulator Centre

Hucknall Aerodrome

Hucknall Aerodrome was a former general aviation and RAF aerodrome located north north-west of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England, and west of Hucknall town. The aerodrome had been operated by the Merlin Flying Club since 1971 and then by Rolls-Royce Group plc. Before its closure, it was owned and operated by ITP Aero.
Hucknall Aerodrome had a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P507) that allowed daytime flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee and was not available for public transport passenger flights required to use a licensed aerodrome. It was a C.1916 grass aerodrome of significant historical importance. On 1 March 2015 the aerodrome closed indefinitely to be turned into a housing and industrial estate.
History.
The Great War.
Hucknall Aerodrome dates to 1916 when it opened under No. 12 (Training) Group, 27th Wing, housing No. 15 Training Depot of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) operating the Curtiss JN-4 Jenny. During February 1918, No. 218 (Gold Coast) Squadron (see No. 218 Squadron RAF) arrived operating the de Havilland DH.9. On 1 March 1918, No. 130 Squadron (see No. 130 Squadron RAF) arrived also operating the DH.9.
On 18 March 1918, No. 205 Squadron arrived operating de Havilland DH.4 and DH.9s. During April, No. 135 Squadron RAF was formed but were allocated no aircraft and disbanded on 4 July 1918 along with No. 130 Squadron. On arrival, all of these squadrons were absorbed into No. 15 Training Depot and following creation of the Royal Air Force (RAF) on 1 April 1918, No. 15 Training Depot RFC was absorbed into this new organisation.
On 18 August 1918 a detachment of the United States Army Air Service arrived, the 23d Aero Squadron (Repair), who were engaged with the depot in aircraft and engine repair activities. On 5 November 1918 the 23d Aero Squadron (Repair) left.
By the end of June 1919, No. 205 and 218 Squadrons were disbanded, which left the aerodrome with no aircraft or squadrons. In 1919, the Air Ministry closed Hucknall and sold it to a local farmer, George Elkington.
Nottingham Aero Club.
In 1926, following contact with George Elkington, it was agreed to allow the new Nottingham Aero Club to operate from the former RFC General Service Sheds/Belfast Truss Hangars (see lattice truss bridge) situated to the north of the aerodrome. The club committee consisted of President Sir Harold Bowden, Vice-President Sir Albert Ball; the father of the famous Great War pilot Captain Albert Ball; Mr D. Rushworth, the Chairman; Mr C. R. Sands, the Hon. Treasurer; and Mr R. Macpherson, the Hon. Secretary. The club's pilot was Mr Bernard Martin. The club used the de Havilland DH.60 Moth.
On 30 July 1927 they competed in the King's Cup Race which finished at Hucknall. Sixteen starters set out with the winner W. L. Hope (race number 5) flying DH.60 Moth G-EBME over the course of at an average speed of . Other competing aircraft that completed the race at Hucknall included a Cierva Autogiro Company C8L Mark 2 Autogyro G-EBYY and an Avro 566 Avenger II G-EBND, this was a prototype fighter aircraft which never enter production.
During the late 1920s it was decided that the RAF needed to be modernised and expanded to meet expected future demands. Subsequently, Hucknall was identified for expansion into an RAF station and was bought by the Air Ministry in the latter part of 1927. This period is commonly known as the '1930s expansion period' and many aerodromes were reopened or upgraded during this time. The Nottingham Aero Club vacated the aerodrome during 1928 before the formation of No. 504 (County of Nottingham) Squadron and the official RAF opening. A large proportion of the buildings from 1916 and the expansion period are still extant, including the C.1916 General Service Sheds, which are listed buildings under English Heritage monument number 1398209.
Royal Air Force renaissance.
The aerodrome reopened as RAF Hucknall in 1928 and contained the new No. 504 (County of Nottingham) Squadron. The first commanding officer was Squadron Leader Charles M. Elliot-Smith, AFC. This squadron was formed on 26 March 1928 as a light bomber Special Reserve Unit and operated the Hawker Horsley. For training purposes they also operated the Avro 504K, Avro 504N and the Avro 621. In 1935 the Hawker Horsley was replaced by the Westland Wallace, another light bomber. On 18 May 1936 the new Squadron Leader Hugh Seely, Bart, MP (later Hugh Seely, 1st Baron Sherwood) read out a signal that along with the other Special Reserve Units, No. 504 Squadron were to be embodied into the Auxiliary Air Force. In May 1937 the Wallaces were exchanged for the Hawker Hind light bomber.
On 21 August 1936, No. 98 Squadron RAF and No. 104 Squadron RAF arrived, also with the Hawker Hind, training exercises involving the three light bomber squadrons took place, this included bombing exercises at Otmoor ranges. On 2 May 1938, No. 104 Squadron left Hucknall for RAF Bassingbourn with No. 98 Squadron remaining at Hucknall and converting to the Fairey Battle light bomber. On 31 October 1938 No. 504 Squadron ended their association with light bombers and became a fighter squadron, the Gloster Gauntlet replacing the Hawker Hind. As a result of this change there was no longer a need for air gunners but Seely negotiated for some to train as Non-Commissioned Officer Pilots for the Gauntlet. A further change for the squadron was a new squadron badge, which incorporated the Major Oak Tree, indicative of nearby Sherwood Forest, the badge featured the squadron's motto 'Vindicat in Venti' ().
Throughout the 1930s, Hucknall hosted an annual Empire Air Day with the resident squadrons giving aerobatic and air attack demonstrations. The last of these was on 20 May 1939, when No. 504 Squadron had just replaced the Gauntlet with the new monoplane fighter, the Hawker Hurricane I. During the middle part of 1939 and as part of the work up of the squadron for war, Seely initially took a post at the RAF Duxford Operations Room with Squadron Leader Victor Beamish AFC assuming command and the Rt. Hon. Lord Mottistone (see J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone) agreeing to be the first Honorary Air Commodore. On 27 August 1939 Beamish was signalled to move the squadron to RAF Digby for intensive war training. On 26 April 1939 the Mayor of Derby visited No. 98 Squadron, they had been affiliated to Derby as part of the Air Ministry Municipal Liaison Scheme. After No. 504 Squadron had departed No. 98 Squadron remained as the sole unit at Hucknall and in turn on 2 March 1940 were signalled to leave for Nantes, France.
Second World War.
In July 1939 the aerodrome was subject to the Army Home Defence Scheme, all aircraft would be camouflaged and airfield defences upgraded. At Hucknall three dispersals were created on the south, west and north west perimeters of the airfield. The south dispersal featured a concrete pentagonal pillbox with an adjoining mounting for an anti-aircraft gun, (see British hardened field defences of World War II) along with a Stanton air-raid shelter and a flight office of wooden frame and corrugated steel construction; the west dispersal featured slit trenches and a wooden flight hut and the north-west dispersal featured two Stanton air-raid shelters along with a wooden flight hut.
A further Stanton shelter was positioned to the north-east of the flying ground perimeter and a further Type 24 machine gun post of brick construction south-east of the flying ground perimeter. To the north of the station over Watnall Road and within the billet area a fortified battle headquarters was positioned; it is from here the station would have been commanded in the event of an attack by enemy forces.
The primary defence of the aerodrome at this time was the responsibility of the Sherwood Foresters Regiment but in late 1940 this was handed over the Royal Air Force Regiment. In tandem with the upgrade of the airfield defences a bunker at nearby RAF Watnall was constructed to house No. 12 Group RAF (Fighter Command) for the command and control of fighters in their sector; they moved into the bunker in late 1940. No. 12 Group had been based at Hucknall along with No. 1 Group RAF (Bomber Command) since 1939. All the defensive works are extant, with the flight office and huts missing.
In 1940, No. 1 (RAF) Ferry Pilots Pool under the command of Flight Lieutenant G. W. H. Wild, which ferried repaired aircraft and the No. 12 Group Communications Flight were the only RAF flying units at the aerodrome. On 10 September 1940 Squadron Leader Douglas Bader flew to Hucknall and met with Air Vice Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory, commander of No. 12 Group with regard to the Squadron Leader's Big Wing proposal.
On 21 December 1940, the station was visited by a Dutch pilot who claimed to be Captain van Lott who had force landed in a Wellington bomber and was part of a special squadron and needed to borrow an aircraft to return to his base at RAF Dyce near Aberdeen. The pilot was in fact Franz von Werra who had escaped from the prisoner of war camp at Swanwick, Derbyshire and was arrested. A film of Werra's exploits was made in 1957, "The One That Got Away". During early 1941, No. 1 Group Bomber Command left Hucknall for RAF Bawtry.
In January 1941, No. 1 (Polish) Flying Training School was formed at Hucknall, this unit was involved in the ab-initio and advanced training of Polish airmen. The school used the Tiger Moth for elementary training, the Fairey Battle for advanced training and the Airspeed Oxford for advanced multi engine training. The unit was renamed No. 16 Service Flying Training School RAF during June 1941 and moved to RAF Newton in July 1941. On 16 July 1941, another training unit arrived at Hucknall, No. 25 Elementary Flying Training School RAF operating the Tiger Moth. They would stay at Hucknall in the training role along with No. 12 Group Communications Flight and the ATA Ferry Pool until the end of the war.
Postwar use.
In May 1946, No. 504 Squadron reformed at RAF Syerston and returned to Hucknall operating the de Havilland Mosquito NF.30 night-fighter. The new commanding officer was Squadron Leader A. H. Rook DFC AFC. In May 1948, the Mosquitos were replaced by Supermarine Spitfire F.22 day-fighters, with Squadron Leader J. M. Birkin DFC AFC taking over command and Sir Hugh Seely becoming the Honorary Vice Commodore. In March 1950 the squadron completed the move to RAF Wymeswold. In 1946, the Nottingham University Air Squadron arrived operating the Tiger Moth and left for RAF Newton in 1947.
In 1946, No. 12 Group's underground bunker at nearby RAF Watnall was vacated and upgraded as part of the ROTOR radar network to track any threats from the Soviet Air Forces, it remained in this capacity until 1961 when it was closed but left in a state of readiness. Some personnel were accommodated at Hucknall with the airfield supporting visits by ROTOR associated communications flight aircraft. In February 2014, the bunker was profiled on Channel 4's "The Restoration Man" when it was undergoing conversion into a 1940s-themed guest house, incorporating many of the original design features.
In 1949, a detachment of No. 664 Squadron RAF (1970 Reserve AOP Flight) arrived operating the Taylorcraft Auster V artillery observation aircraft. In 1951, the AOP 5s were exchanged for the Auster AOP.6. The Austers were operated from the airfield until the disbandment of all auxiliary squadrons in 1957. No. 54 Maintenance Unit RAF which had arrived at Hucknall during 1956 also vacated. The permanent RAF presence at the aerodrome ended in 1957.
Rolls-Royce Flight Test Establishment.
During the early 1930s, it had been recognised that Rolls-Royce (RR) would need an area of open land for the test and validation of new engine designs and modifications. Mr Cyril Lovesey, a private pilot at Nottingham Airport (later RAF Tollerton) had seen the potential at RAF Hucknall. A request to the Air Ministry was made to share the land with the RAF and also for the use of two General Service Sheds for engine development and test flying purposes. Permission was granted and the RR Flight Test Establishment started operating in December 1934. The Chief Test Pilot was Captain Ronald Thomas Shepherd (Ronnie Shephard), who had been a member of the RFC.
The test establishment received the first flying test bed aircraft during the early part of 1935, a Gloster Gnatsnapper, a Hawker Fury and a Hawker Hart. Testing of the Rolls-Royce Kestrel took place to develop performance and increase reliability. In 1936 Rolls-Royce purchased a German Heinkel He70 airliner registration G-ADZF delivered to Hucknall fitted with a Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine. Then the fastest aircraft available "öff the shelf". In 1938 Rolls-Royce fitted a Rolls-Royce Peregrine engine which raised the aircraft's top speed to . (Ref Flight International 29 April 1971 "The evolution of Hucknall") A new engine, the Rolls-Royce PV.12 which would be developed into the Rolls-Royce Merlin, was installed in the Hawker Fury. Using flying test beds subsequent Marks of the Merlin and Griffon engine would be development flight tested at Hucknall throughout the war, including the first flight of the Merlin-powered North American P-51 Mustang.
In early 1940, two Bellman hangars were constructed and as the Battle of Britain started in August a Civilian Repair Organisation operated by Rolls-Royce was established to repair Hurricanes. The organisation also converted 100 Hurricanes to Mark II standard by installing the Rolls-Royce Merlin XX engine. A further conversion programme installed the Merlin 45 into the first Supermarine Spitfire Mk.Vs, and later approximately 300 Spitfire Vs were converted to Mk.IXs. The ferrying of repaired or modified aircraft was the responsibility of No. 1 (RAF) Ferry Pilots Pool and the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA).
In 1942, the flight test establishment started tests on the new Power Jets Whittle Unit (WU) engine, designed by Sir Frank Whittle. The flying test bed used was a Vickers Wellington with a modified rear fuselage to accept the jet. The engine was developed into the Rolls-Royce Welland and powered early versions of the Gloster Meteor.
During the late 1940s and into the 1950s, the flight test establishment continued tests using the Avro Lancastrian for the testing of Rolls-Royce Nene and Rolls-Royce Avon engines. The Avro Lancasters and Avro Lincolns were used for testing prototype turboprop engines, a Douglas DC-3 being used for the flight test of the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop and a Gloster Meteor was used for testing a Rolls-Royce RB.50 Trent Turboprop engine.
During the early 1950s, there was an expansion of the flight test establishment infrastructure which included a new hard runway suitable for heavy or fast military aircraft along with a large flight test hangar and upgraded airfield instruments including radar. Most of the buildings including the runway from this period are extant, though the radar and instruments are missing. In 1951, Ronald "Ronnie" Harker took over as the Chief Test Pilot. During the 1950s, he was replaced by Harvey Heyworth followed by his brother Jim Heyworth until 1962. Cliff Rogers was the Chief Test Pilot at Hucknall until 1971. Harvey Heyworth had been a pilot with No. 504 Squadron latterly flying the Hawker Hurricane with Jim Heyworth and Cliff Rogers flying the Vickers Wellington and Avro Lancaster during the war.
In July 1953, the flight test establishment achieved the world's first jet vertical take off and landing (VTOL) with the Nene powered Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig, also known as the Flying Bedstead. All Rolls-Royce engines (see list of Rolls-Royce engines) from 1934 were tested at Hucknall using flying test bed aircraft, finishing with the Rolls-Royce RB211 22B Turbofan on the Vickers VC10. Most RR powered aircraft since 1934 have been test flown from Hucknall. The flight test establishment closed in 1971 and moved to Filton with operation of the airfield passing to Merlin Flying Club. Ground development testing of RR engines continued using test bed facilities until closure in 2007.
Merlin Flying Club.
In 1962, the Merlin Flying Club (RR employees flying club) arrived at Hucknall from Nottingham (Tollerton) Airport. The club initially had no aircraft but set up its operation on the former wartime RAF south dispersal. The first Chief Flying Instructor was Arthur 'Barney' Barnard, a test pilot at the RR flight test establishment. To enable the club to provide flying training, in 1963 it received an Auster J/4 aircraft registered G-AIPH. Towards the end of 1963 a major overhaul of the Auster took place. The club also modified the aircraft to accept a Continental O-200 engine, replacing the ageing Blackburn Cirrus Minor engine. RR Chief Test Pilot Cliff Rogers conducted the validation flying for the engine modification and overhaul.
In 1966, Gerry Price took over as the Chief Flying Instructor. He was replaced by Ken Whitehurst in 1988, with Colin Hutson taking over later the same year and who continues the role. In 1967, due to high demand for training, the club received a further Auster J/4 with a registration of G-AIJT. This was also later modified with the Continental O-200 engine. From the end of the 1960s, the number of aircraft types at Hucknall expanded through group formation and aircraft building. Previous aircraft based at Hucknall include the following types:
In 1972, Auster J/4 G-AIPH was replaced by a Jodel DR1050 Ambassadeur registered as G-AYMT to provide a long-distance touring for qualified pilots. In 1977, Auster J/4 G-AIJT was replaced by a Cessna 150 registered as G-APXY for flying training. Following the use of loan aircraft, in 1983 a further Cessna FA150K Aerobat registered G-BHRH was permanently added for flying and aerobatic training. In 1989, the Jodel DR.1050 was replaced by a Robin DR.220A registered G-BKOV with a further change to Robin DR.220 registered G-BUTH in 1998. Finally, this was also replaced in 1999 by a Robin DR.221B Dauphin registered as G-RRCU for touring and tail wheel training. Between 2001 and 2013, a de Havilland Chipmunk G-BNWT (WP901) was also available for pilot re-validation and tail wheel training. In 2006, Cessna 150 G-APXY was replaced by a Cessna F150L registered as G-YIII. This aircraft was lost in a fatal incident in June 2014.
In August 2014 the following aircraft types were based at Hucknall:
On 1 March 2015, the Aerodrome was closed by Rolls-Royce and the Merlin Flying Club evicted with a move to Tatenhill Airfield.
Air shows and flying.
The Merlin Flying Club organised two annual events. In June, the Merlin Pageant consisted of flying and static displays from warbird and vintage aircraft; vintage vehicles also featured. In August, the Robin Hood Fly-in was a gathering of general aviation aircraft, with the onus on classic, vintage and homebuilt aircraft types.
Air Training Corps.
In June 2013, 1803 (Hucknall) Squadron of the Air Training Corps (ATC) was extant on the north of the aerodrome.
Current use.
During April 2013, a planning application (reference V/2013/0123) was submitted by Muse Developments and Rolls-Royce PLC to Ashfield District Council for a mixed housing and industrial development on the aerodrome, plans which would end flying. In April 2014, outline planning permission was granted. Some tourism and historical interested parties had suggested an alternative future potential for the aerodrome, involving a working museum with a concept similar to the Imperial War Museum Duxford in Cambridgeshire or the Shuttleworth Collection in Bedfordshire. On 1 March 2015, the aerodrome closed permanently with the ground developed for housing and industrial use.

Chalgrove Airfield

Chalgrove Airfield is a former Second World War airfield in Oxfordshire, England. It is approximately north-northeast of Benson in the heart of South Oxfordshire between Henley and Oxford; about north-northwest of London.
Opened in 1943, it was used by both the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces. During the war, it was used primarily as a combat reconnaissance airfield. It was closed in late 1946.
Today, the airfield is primarily used by the Martin-Baker company for testing ejection seats.
It was announced on 6 September 2016 that Chalgrove Airfield had been the subject of a ministerial transfer from the MoD to the Homes and Communities Agency (now called Homes England), with a view to building a housing-led mixed-use development on part of the airfield as part of the South Oxfordshire District Council's Local Plan 2034. This is subject to review and consultation, with the examination-in-public starting in July 2020.
Homes England submitted an outline planning application on 19 June 2020 for 3,000 homes, a secondary and two primary schools, a new town centre and 40,000 square metres of employment space, along with community and leisure uses which will be determined by South Oxfordshire District Council.
History.
United States Army Air Forces use.
Chalgrove was allocated to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) by the Air Ministry on 1 November 1942. It was known as USAAF Station AAF-465 for security reasons by the USAAF during the war, and by which it was referred to instead of the location.
USAAF station units assigned to RAF Chalgrove were: 
10th Reconnaissance Group.
The first residents of the airfield was the 10th Reconnaissance Group which arrived from Key Field, Mississippi in January 1944. The group consisted of the following operational squadrons:
The 30th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron (PRS) arrived in January and early February. The 31st, 33rd and 34th PRS became operational at Chalgrove in April.
The primary aircraft flown by the group consisted of photographic versions of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning (F-5) and North American P-51 Mustang (F-6). In addition, the unit also flew the Stinson L-1 Vigilant and L-5 Sentinel along with the Piper L-4 Grasshopper light observation aircraft.
In May 1944 the 30th PRS moved to RAF Middle Wallop and it was replaced by the 423rd Night Fighter Squadron with Douglas A-20 Havoc (F-3A) from RAF Charmy Down which was used for night photo-reconnaissance. In June the 423d was renamed the 155th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron.
After the invasion, the 15th TPRS moved into France first, to the Advanced Landing Ground at Rennes–Saint-Jacques, France (ALG A-27) on 10 July. The other squadrons of the 10th moved over the next few weeks, the last being the 155th which moved to France in mid-August.
25th Bombardment Group (Reconnaissance).
In August 1944 the 653d Bombardment Squadron of the 25th Bombardment Group based at RAF Watton moved to Chalgrove. The 653d was an Eighth Air Force unit equipped with special weather reconnaissance Mosquito PRXVI's which operated over the waters adjacent to the British Isles and occasionally to the Azores to obtain meteorological data. The squadron also flew over mainland Europe for weather information needed in planning operations. In November 1945 the squadron was inactivated.
7th Reconnaissance Group.
In March 1945 the 13th, 14th and 22nd Photographic Reconnaissance Squadrons from the VII Air Service Command 7th Reconnaissance Group moved to Chalgrove from RAF Mount Farm flying P-51 Mustangs (F-6). Fuselage codes were "ES" for the 13th PRS and "G2" for the 22nd. The unit also flew the Stinson L-5 Sentinel light observation aircraft.
The group was inactivated at the 4th Strategic Air Depot (Hitcham) on 21 November 1945.
Royal Air Force use.
With the inactivation of the 25th Bomb Group, the USAAF returned the airfield to the RAF on 1 December 1945.
Post RAF use.
With the end of military control, Chalgrove Airfield was leased by the Ministry of Defence to Martin-Baker in July 1946 for the development and testing of ejection seats. Although most of the hardstands have been removed over the years, all of the runways and perimeter track exist and are still in use by Martin-Baker. Two of the wartime T2 hangars are in use as part of the airfield and the Monument Industrial Estate site just to the south-east of the airfield contains some old USAAF buildings that were once part of the airfield.
Chalgrove Aerodrome has a CAA ordinary licence (number P683) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Martin-Baker (Engineering) Limited). The aerodrome is not licensed for night use. Runways 06/24 and 18/36 became unlicensed in 2012.
In 2016, under the "A Better Defence Estate" review, ownership of the site was transferred from the Ministry of Defence to Homes England with the intention of redeveloping the site for 3,000 homes.
In popular culture.
Chalgrove appeared in an episode of the British TV series "The Professionals", the Cessna 172 being used by an escaper supposedly crashing into an airfield building. An episode of the cult series "The Prisoner" also used Chalgrove, including sequences involving a Martin-Baker Gloster Meteor.

Castelnau, London

Castelnau () is a road in Barnes, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, south west London, approximately west from Charing Cross on the south side of the River Thames. About long, it is the main road south from Hammersmith Bridge and forms part of the A306 road. It was originally named Upper Bridge Road. The name Castelnau is also used informally for Castelnau Estate and the area surrounding the road. It joins Church Road at is southern end, which then runs westwards beside Barnes Green until it meets Barnes High Street.
An area of Barnes including Castelnau was designated a conservation area in 1977.
Etymology.
Castelnau takes its name from Castelnau-Valence, near Nîmes in France: in 1691, the 10th Baron of Castelnau and St Croix, a Huguenot, fled France for England following persecution, and his son, Charles Boileau, settled in north Barnes and his descendants developed parts of the area. Maurice Boileau, the other son of the 10th Baron, stayed in the Castle and his descendants still live in the castle.
Castelnau means "new castle" in the Occitan language.
History.
Castelnau was developed after the opening of Hammersmith Bridge in 1827.
Major Charles Lestock Boileau built Castelnau Villas (now 84–122 and 91–125 Castelnau), designed by the architect William Laxton, in 1842, followed by rows of cottages called Castelnau Row, Castelnau Place and Gothic Cottages. After his death in 1889, Upper Bridge Road was renamed Castelnau.
Castelnau Estate.
In 1926, London County Council built a cottage estate of 640 houses, called Castelnau Estate, on the site of a market garden. In 1971 these passed to ownership of Richmond upon Thames Council. Many are now privately owned. Many of the roads in this estate are named after Deans of St. Paul's who had been Lords of the manor of Barnes between the 14th and 17th centuries: Everdon, Kilmington, Alderbury, Kentwode, Howsman and Stillingfleet.
Notable buildings.
Castelnau is noted for 20 pairs of exceptional classical villas, 91-125 Castelnau, which were built in 1842 by Major Boileau (see above) and are Grade II listed.
There are also two churches:
From around the time of World War II to 1987, the art dealership Abbott and Holder operated a gallery in the house at 73 Castelnau, which was also the home of the founder, Robert Abbott.

Papa Westray Airport

Papa Westray Airport is located north of Kirkwall Airport on Papa Westray, Orkney Islands, Scotland. The facility is best known for being one of the two airports joined by the shortest scheduled flight in the world, a leg of Loganair's inter-island service, to Westray Airport. The distance is and the scheduled flight time, including taxiing, is two minutes.
Papa Westray Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P542) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers and for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Orkney Islands Council). The aerodrome is not licensed for night use.
In March 2025 "The Economist" sought out readers to share their favourite airports with the publication. Stephanie Mitchell brought PPW to readers' attention by claiming that "...when it comes to most wonderful airports the honour must go to one or both of Papa Westray in Orkney or Barra in the Hebrides. No danger of feeling like a sheep in the crowd in either one, although either probably offers close proximity to actual sheep."

Penzance Heliport

Penzance Heliport is located northeast of Penzance, Cornwall. The heliport hosts scheduled flights to the Isles of Scilly, with a connection to the railway network at Penzance railway station by a special bus service. 
Penzance Heliport has existed at two separate locations at different times. The newer heliport was built during 2018 and 2019 on the north side of Jelbert Way and the A30, and is the base for a helicopter service to the islands of Tresco and St Mary's.
The original heliport, on the south side of Jelbert Way and a few hundred metres closer to Penzance, was opened in 1964, and operated for 48 years before closing in 2012.
Original heliport (19642012).
Services started on 1 May 1964 when British European Airways (BEA) Helicopters operated the first service between Penzance and the Isles of Scilly with a Sikorsky S-61.
The original heliport was formally opened five months later on 1 September 1964 by Councillor Alfred Beckerleg, the Mayor of Penzance with the Lady Mayoress, and cost £88,000 (). This heliport had a single concrete landing pad, which was , adjacent to a grass strip, aligned 08/26.
With the merger of BEA and BOAC to form British Airways in 1974 the helicopter division was renamed British Airways Helicopters. In 1986, the helicopter division was sold to Robert Maxwell's Maxwell Aviation and renamed British International Helicopters, who continued to operate the Penzance to Isles of Scilly route until it was withdrawn in 2012, forty-eight years after it was first scheduled.
In early April 2013, demolition work on the main terminal buildings began, and by September 2013, nothing remained of the former heliport (at ), with a supermarket chain now dominating the site.
New heliport (2020present).
In 2016 plans were announced for a new helicopter service between Penzance and the Isles of Scilly, serving both St Mary's and Tresco. The proposals include building a new heliport on Jelbert Way, Penzance, near to the location of the old one. The planning application received the highest level of support Cornwall Council had ever received for a planning application.
Planning consent for the new heliport was first granted in a unanimous decision by Cornwall Council's Strategic Planning Committee in February 2017. The decision was later challenged by the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company in a judicial review. A petition against the Judicial Review gained more than 11,000 signatures and an amended planning application was submitted.
The amended application was granted planning consent in a second unanimous decision by Cornwall Council in August 2018.
The new heliport was built during 2018 and 2019, with services commencing in March 2020, flying to the islands of St Mary's and Tresco.

Warton Aerodrome

Warton Aerodrome is an airfield located in Warton village on the Fylde in Lancashire, England. It is west of Preston, Lancashire. The eastern end of the site adjoins the village of Freckleton.
The airfield is a major assembly and testing facility of BAE Systems Military Air &amp; Information. It is also part of the Lancashire Enterprise Zone.
Warton Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P748) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction, as authorised by the licensee (BAE Systems (Operations) Limited).
History.
Establishment and military use.
In 1940 new runways were built at Warton so that it could act as a "satellite" airfield for the RAF Coastal Command station at Squires Gate airfield in Blackpool.
The airfield was first operated as an air depot of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) during the Second World War, as thousands of aircraft were processed on their way to active service in Britain, North Africa, the Mediterranean and mainland Europe. It hosted the 402d Air Depot, later the 402d Base Air Depot, from 15 April 1943 - 24 November 1945.
On 14 August 1944 Glenn Miller, recently promoted to the rank of major, played a concert to 10,000 servicemen on a platform erected in front of No. 4 Hangar. On 23 August 1944, the accidental crash of a USAAF Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber caused the Freckleton Air Disaster, resulting in 61 fatalities, including 38 children and two teenagers.
It then became a Royal Air Force station.
Aircraft manufacturers.
In 1947, English Electric took over the site, moving its main design office there from the Strand Road site in Preston in 1948.
With the merger of English Electric Aviation and the other aircraft divisions of the major British manufacturers in 1960, it became a British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) site. BAC was then nationalised and merged with Hawker Siddeley and Scottish Aviation to form British Aerospace (BAe) in 1977. British Aerospace was privatised in 1981 and was renamed BAE Systems in 1999. As such the airfield has been the flight test centre for various frontline military aircraft including the English Electric Canberra, the English Electric Lightning, the BAC TSR-2, the Sepecat Jaguar, the Panavia Tornado, the BAE Hawk (formerly the Hawker Siddeley Hawk) and most recently the Eurofighter Typhoon.
Development.
Eurofighter Typhoon.
Warton was used as the base for all British development aircraft (DA) and Instrumented Production Aircraft (IPA) in the Eurofighter programme. Warton has been home to the initial Typhoon squadrons of the Royal Air Force, No. 17 Squadron and No. 29 Squadron. This was under the so-called "Case White" programme where BAE assumes more responsibility for training and support of the new aircraft than previous RAF types which were introduced under a more "in house" system. BAE states that this allows inevitable problems with any new aircraft to be quickly ironed out by BAE personnel on site. BAE plans to offer this on site service to any export customers.
Nimrod.
Warton was also used for development flying of the Nimrod MRA4 Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack aircraft until the aircraft was cut in the Strategic Defence and Security Review in 2010.
Production.
Tornado.
The final new build Tornado left Warton in 1998, a GR.1 for Saudi Arabia. Following this the main assembly hall was re-fitted as the final assembly site of the Eurofighter Typhoon. BAE estimate that modern manufacturing techniques will allow the 30-week assembly time for a Tornado to be reduced to 16 weeks for the Typhoon.
Private airfield.
Warton is the base for BAE Systems' "Corporate Air Travel" department which operates scheduled services for employees (and those of partner organisations) to Farnborough, Munich, Cambridge, RAF Coningsby, and RAF Marham. The Farnborough and Munich services are provided by Corporate Air Travel's Embraer 145 aircraft, with the others contracted out to other operators. Many "ad hoc" passenger flights also take place operated by various VIP operators.
The site is not open to the public. For many years limited areas were made accessible during open days, on a four-yearly cycle alternating with Samlesbury, which the company held for the families and friends of employees and local residents. These "Families' Days" were free of charge and typically included demonstrations of activities, tours of simulation facilities and impressive flying displays. The last Families' Day was held in 2006.
Police helicopter.
From November 1994, the Lancashire Constabulary operated a Eurocopter AS355 helicopter stationed at Warton. Later, it was replaced by a newer, more capable, EC135.
This has now been withdrawn and is being covered by the National Police Air Service based at Barton.
Lightning XS928.
The airfield has English Electric Lightning F.6 "XS928" on permanent static display
Protests.
In January 1996 four women, known as the Ploughshare Four, caused more than £1.5m in damage to a Hawk warplane at the site. They were found not guilty of criminal damage at Liverpool Crown Court after a jury deemed their action was reasonable under the Genocide Act 1969. The Hawk was destined for Indonesia where the women argued it would likely be used to kill civilians in East Timor.
On 29 January 2017 Rev Dan Woodhouse, a Methodist minister in Leeds and Sam Walton, a Quaker, were arrested at the site after allegedly trying to disarm warplanes bound for Saudi Arabia. Lancashire Constabulary said they were being held on suspicion of causing criminal damage. In a statement, Woodhouse said stopping warplanes "would save lives". Walton reported that the two carried one of the hammers used by the Ploughshare Four, which had since been confiscated by police. In October 2017 Walton and Woodhouse appeared at Burnley Magistrates court facing charges of criminal damage; both were found not guilty after successfully arguing that they acted for the greater good.
Enterprise zone.
Since 2012, the aerodrome has provided one of the two sites of Lancashire Enterprise Zone, the other site being at BAE Systems' Samlesbury Aerodrome. The zone's site at Warton covers . BAE Systems, Lancashire County Council and Lancashire Enterprise Partnership coordinate the site's development.

Redhill Aerodrome

Redhill Aerodrome is an operational general aviation aerodrome located south-east of Redhill, Surrey, England, in green belt land. It also serves as an important reliever airport for Gatwick airport.
Redhill Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P421) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Redhill Aerodrome Limited).
It is serviced by a brasserie and coffee house called The Pilot's Hub which is situated within Hangar 9 at the aerodrome. The Pilot's Hub is open 7 days a week and is open to the public. It has a large outdoor viewing area and seating area as well as indoor seating and conference room hire. Hangar 9 itself is full of light aircraft, many of them historic, and visitors to The Pilot's Hub can walk around the hangar to see the aircraft close up.
Early history.
The airfield came into use in the 1930s for private flying and it was used as an alternative airfield to Croydon Airport by Imperial Airways.
No. 15 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School RAF was formed at Redhill on 1 July 1937. Training continued at the start of the Second World War using the Miles Magister. The school was renamed to the No. 15 Elementary Flying Training School RAF on 3 September 1939.
The Fairey Battle was also flown particularly for use with the Polish Grading and Testing Flight which was formed here on 14 March 1940.
With the threat of a German attack on the airfield the Flying Training School moved to northern England in June 1940.
RAF Redhill.
With the withdrawal of the Flying Training School the airfield became an operational RAF station. First to move in were 16 Squadron operating the Westland Lysander. The Lysanders did not stay long and RAF Redhill had many short-term deployments, mainly of fighter squadrons.
In August 1942 the airfield had five squadrons based. By the end of 1943 the fighter squadrons had moved on and the airfield was used by support units until the end of the war.
Postwar.
The airfield returned to civilian use in 1947 but was suspended in 1954. In 1959 flying resumed at Redhill when the Tiger Club moved in. The following year Bristow Helicopters started to use Redhill as an operating base and carry out helicopter maintenance for the next 40 years.
The airfield is still operated for private flying and training, with an emphasis on helicopter operators, and additionally functions as an important reliever airport for Gatwick Airport. Pilots can use three grass runways. Information on the aerodrome's state can be found on the operator's, Redhill Aerodrome Limited, website.
The aerodrome has its own Air Traffic Control and fire and rescue services.
The airfield has also been the venue for the flying displays and aviation trade shows, including the annual Redhill Airshow in the past, which was focused around a charitable cause.
On 17 May 2012 it was announced that the owners of Redhill Aerodrome had again submitted a planning application for a hard runway after the previous plan had been rejected in 2011. Opponents at the time, including local MP Sam Gyimah, argued that the runway would "create an unacceptable level of noise and pollution and destroy the landscape". In June 2013 the second application was also refused. In February 2014 the aerodrome lost a planning appeal; it was appealing against the June 2013 decision to reject the planning application.
At the start of 2013, the Surrey and Sussex Air Ambulance service relocated its helicopter to Redhill from Dunsfold Aerodrome in order to enable it to provide a night flight service across Kent, Surrey and Sussex.
On 24 December 2013, the aerodrome suffered storm damage and flooding, with some light aircraft overturned.
On 13th April 2015, the aerodrome suffered a large fire, with a number of businesses destroyed.
Redhill Airshow.
The Redhill Airshow was a "garden party" style event held at Redhill Aerodrome until 2006. The show has seen flypasts by the Red Arrows and displays from the Royal Air Force solo display teams, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight including the Lancaster Bomber and other popular warbirds.
In June 2015, a smaller airshow was introduced under the title of the Redhill Aviation Festival.

Old Sarum Airfield

Old Sarum Airfield is a grass strip airfield north-north-east of Salisbury, in Laverstock parish, Wiltshire, England.
The adjacent areas are a mix of vacant land, residential and industrial sites. Residential areas lie to the south and east, occupying the old airfield married quarters and officers' mess, now known as Throgmorton Hall. Industrial/business units occupy a number of the First World War and Second World War airfield buildings, as well as several large modern warehouses, office blocks and car showrooms.
Old Sarum is a well-preserved flying field of the First World War period, bounded by one of the most complete suites of technical and hangar buildings of the period. The site has three Grade II* listed hangars and a Grade II listed former workshop, all built in 1918, as well as a Grade II listed Territorial Army Headquarters (the 1935 Station Headquarters).
The airfield was designated as a conservation area by Salisbury District Council in February 2007.
An aviation museum opened in Hangar 1 in July 2012, after the Boscombe Down Aviation Collection relocated from the nearby Boscombe Down airfield.
Airspace and procedures.
Old Sarum airfield Aerodrome Traffic Zone (ATZ) sits within the nearby MoD Boscombe Down Military Aerodrome Traffic Zone (MATZ). Old Sarum Airfield procedures dictate that all circuits, weekday and weekend, are to the south with a crosswind departure and a base leg joins at circuit height. During the times when the MATZ is inactive, Boscombe Down's ATZ is still active.
The aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (number P768) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee, Blanefield Airfield Operations. The aerodrome is not currently licensed for night use. Unlicensed night flying is permitted but the airfield owners chose not to allow night flying from 2007 in order to reduce noise complaints under an understanding with Salisbury District Council, as it then was. The owners later decided to install lights and resume night flying for a time.
History.
First World War.
The site for Old Sarum Airfield – just east of the hill on which stood the abandoned medieval settlement of Old Sarum – was selected in 1917, to provide a training station for the rapidly expanding Royal Flying Corps. Like many others of this period, the airfield was provided with a cluster of general service sheds and a camp consisting largely of wooden buildings. It was opened in August 1917 and was briefly known at first as 'Ford Farm' but very soon took instead the name of the local landmark.
Its first task was to act as a base for the formation of three new day bomber squadrons which would ultimately be sent across the English Channel to operate in France. The Royal Air Force (RAF) was founded on 1 April 1918, by the amalgamation of the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service. On the same day a new flying training unit was formed at Old Sarum, to become the airfield's principal resident unit. This was 11 Training Depot Station, whose task was the operational training of fresh aircrews.
1918 to 1939.
At the end of the First World War, Old Sarum was one of the few airfields which were not closed as part of the post war run-down. In 1920, 11 Training Squadron was disbanded and preparations were made to turn the station into the permanent home of the School of Army Co-operation. The School was transferred to Old Sarum from Stonehenge Aerodrome in January 1921 and for many years ran mixed courses for Army and Air Force personnel. Its prime task was the development of efficient air/ground communication under operational conditions, principally between Army officers, including those of the newly formed armoured forces, and the pilots and observers of the RAF Army Cooperation Squadrons.
A 'Special Duty Flight' was formed here in about 1926 to work with the Experimental Gas School at Porton Down, not far away. This used a handful of aircraft including a Bristol Fighter, a Dart and a Horsley, and was transferred to Netheravon in 1928. In April 1924, 16 Squadron was re-formed at Old Sarum for cooperation with Army units in Southern Command. Initially equipped with Bristol F.2 Fighters, it subsequently received the Armstrong Whitworth Atlas, in January 1931, and Hawker Audaxes in December 1933. With these types it took part in exercises all over southern England. In June 1938 it became the first unit to equip with the Westland Lysander.
The mid-1930s saw the beginning of the RAF expansion scheme, where many First World War airfield sites were inspected to see if they would be suitable for the new permanent stations which were planned due to the increased threat to Britain from Nazi Germany. Old Sarum Airfield was identified as suitable for becoming a permanent station, and the period between 1934 and 1937 saw the construction of new domestic, administrative and technical buildings. This increased the area of the airfield occupied by station buildings from to roughly . The flying field remained the same size.
Three other operational squadrons were based at the airfield for varying periods between 1935 and 1939. First of these was another army cooperation unit, 13 Squadron, whose Audaxes were based here from May 1935. Next came the Hawker Hinds of a new light bomber squadron – 107 – which stayed here until 1937. The third unit, 59 Squadron, was formed here in June 1937 and was a new army cooperation unit, intended to carry out night reconnaissance using Hawker Hector aircraft. Subsequently, it was decided to replace these with higher-performance Bristol Blenheims and in May 1939 the squadron transferred to Andover to make the transition.
Second World War.
At the outbreak of war, the appearance of RAF Old Sarum had changed little. Its line of hangars still looked out onto the grass flying field, while a Roman road still formed the northern border of the airfield. The squadron continued to be primarily engaged in training and developing ground support techniques, including the spraying of poison gas, although this was never actually used. In February the 16 Squadron left for France via RAF Hawkinge and its place was taken by the first two Canadian flying units to arrive in Britain – 111 and 112 Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Squadrons. The final operational unit to be based here during this period was 225 Squadron RAF, another Lysander equipped unit. This took the place of 110 RCAF Squadron on 9 June 1940 and with the growing threat of a Nazi invasion of the Britain, it was engaged in patrolling the south coast for enemy landings.
In 1939, the establishment of aircraft was increased to serve the expanding School of Army Co-operation. In February 1940 a new 'D' Flight was formed within the School for artillery spotting duties. It was out-stationed at Larkhill to be close to the Royal Artillery camp there, and served as the nucleus from which all future air observation post (AOP) units originated.
During the Battle of Britain, as losses mounted, the shortage of fighter pilots became so desperate that a number of army cooperation trainees were selected at Old Sarum and immediately sent to Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire training units. During the massive campaign of enemy attacks on RAF airfields in the summer and autumn of 1940, Old Sarum escaped lightly, but during the night of 11/12 May 1941 one hangar was burnt out in an air raid and two aircraft were destroyed.
During the first two years of war, it became clear that higher performance aircraft were needed and so a small number of Hurricanes and Harvards joined the unit in early 1941; they were soon followed by a flight of Curtiss P-40 Tomahawks. Because of the limitations of the landing ground at Old Sarum, a larger satellite was prepared at Oatlands Hill, some away to the north-west. Oatlands Hill was equipped with only basic flying facilities and most of the maintenance work had still to be undertaken at Old Sarum, but henceforth all higher performance aircraft would carry out their training programmes at Oatlands Hill.
In August 1941, the first full AOP squadron was formed. This was 651 Squadron and it was equipped with Taylorcrafts, flown by specially trained army pilots. They were frequently detached to Larkhill to train with the gunners there, and in the following spring the squadron joined Army manoeuvres, thus establishing the practice of sending small detachments of aircraft to improvised advanced landing grounds "in the field".
The advances in size and performance of aircraft types from the Lysander to the Tomahawk prompted a reorganisation, and the Training Wing was redesignated 41 Operational Training Unit. The development and teaching of methods of artillery reconnaissance were undertaken here from 1942. However, these activities required a permanent runway instead of a flying field, and so 41 OTU was transferred out in 1942. It was replaced by a new Fleet Air Arm Squadron, developing tactical reconnaissance. In 1942 Old Sarum became the principal base for the training of AOP with three new squadrons, and 43 OTU moved from Larkhill to Old Sarum. While it was engaged in training new pilots, the facilities at Old Sarum continued to be used for the formation of new Auster squadrons.
655 Squadron formed in December 1942 for Southern Command, and took part in the huge "Spartan" exercise in East Anglia in July 1943 which tested the efficiency of Army co-operation squadrons under mobile conditions, and was effectively a rehearsal for the invasion and liberation of North-West Europe. This led to the formation of Tactical Air Forces (TAF), which were created as replacements for RAF Army Cooperation Command.
The School of Army Cooperation had been reformed at Old Sarum in June 1943 and was subsequently retitled the RAF School of Army Cooperation. In 1944 it was reorganised as the School of Air Support with its own small fleet of aircraft. The experiences of war had highlighted the importance of inter-service cooperation, and increasingly personnel from all three services became based at Old Sarum.
1944 marked the end of a period of major expansion in the AOP squadrons; the spare hangar space at Old Sarum Airfield was used by 3505 Servicing Unit, which maintained numerous aircraft operating in small and scattered detachments to provide practice facilities for anti-aircraft and searchlight sites.
The brick-built buildings now occupied by Wessex Archaeology immediately adjacent to the airfield include two operations/large scale map rooms with upper viewing galleries: one is now the company's drawing office and the other is the finds processing area.
D-Day.
Plans for the D-Day landings were well advanced by early 1944 and included the requisition of all of the facilities at Old Sarum, to form part of the 2nd TAF Concentration Area. This was, in effect, the hinterland and supply location of the many ports and embarkation points of the ships and landing craft of the invasion forces. All flying training was terminated and 43 OTU left the station entirely.
Thousands of ground personnel, and virtually all RAF motor transport vehicles, destined for Normandy passed through Old Sarum in the D-Day preparation period, making it an integral part in the organisational structure of the D-Day landings. Seven large tented camps were set up in the countryside around the airfield and a force of over a thousand fitters was established to undertake the waterproofing of the 25,000 invasion vehicles. A large part of the airfield was used to assemble the long lines of trucks and other vehicles, and the station hangars were pressed into service as the principal workshops.
As D-Day arrived, there were 34 aircraft at Old Sarum Airfield from three squadrons (658, 659 and 662) waiting to be called forward. Ground support units, ranging from Sector Headquarters and Signals Wings to Servicing Parties and Repair Units continued to pass through until the flow finally ceased in November.
Oatlands Hill.
The satellite site at Oatlands Hill was just south of the A303, about west of Amesbury. It opened in June 1941 and had three grass airstrips, four blister hangars and a few small buildings. The first users were Tomahawks of 239 Squadron, and from September 1941 No. 41 OTU used the site for AOP training as an extension of Old Sarum. This form of usage continued after 43 OTU replaced 41 at Old Sarum in 1942, and Oatlands became the home of 43 OTU when they were ejected from Old Sarum in February 1944 to make room for D-Day preparations. They found the accommodation too small for their officers, men and 30 Austers, and decamped to Andover in August. From late May to late July 1944, a detachment of the 47th Liaison Squadron USAAF was here. For a short time in 1945, RCAF AOP squadrons were trained here.
The Oatlands site closed in May 1945 or in 1946 and returned to farmland. One blister hangar, the station's sick quarters and some foundations and hardstandings remain.
Post Second World War.
In May 1947, the School was re-designated the School of Land/Air Warfare, training Air Force, Army and Navy officers from both the UK and other NATO countries. On 26 June 1956, in recognition of its importance and longevity, RAF Old Sarum was honoured by being given the Freedom of the City of Salisbury. At about the same time, the station also became the home of the Army Air Training and Development Centre which, although 'officed' by the Parachute Regiment, mainly consisted of other corps. REME developed parachute drops of light vehicles and artillery whilst RE undertook the training.
A RAF flying club, the Bustard Flying Club, was formed in 1957 flying two de Havilland Tiger Moth aircraft. The aircraft were used for flying training, with RAF instructors.
One new aspect of post war aviation, which was of interest to all three services, was the widespread use of helicopters. Accordingly, on 1 June 1961, the RAF element of the Helicopter Development Unit (HDU) was formed at Old Sarum, with a handful of early helicopter prototypes, Bristol Sycamores and Westland Whirlwinds, to explore their military potential. In 1965 a new Joint Helicopter Development Unit (JHDU) was formed at Old Sarum and it immediately absorbed the former HDU, which became a section entitled 'Short Range Transport Development Unit'. In 1963 622 (Volunteer) Gliding School (VGS) became based at Old Sarum. The School of Land/Air Warfare was amalgamated with the Amphibious Warfare School from RM Poole in Dorset to form the Joint Warfare Establishment, equipped with a few Whirlwinds and Westland Wessexes.
The final change was the amalgamation of Army Air Transport Development and the JHDU in 1968, to become the Joint Air Transport Establishment (JATE). Old Sarum was transferred from the RAF to the Army in December 1971; the JHDU was disbanded in 1976 but flying continued until November 1978 when 622 VGS moved to Upavon. From 1979 the airfield was no longer a military base.
1982 to 2001.
In 1982 the airfield was sold to Edgley Aircraft Ltd on a 999-year lease, together with the freehold of Hangar 1 (later destroyed by fire), Hangar 2, the original control tower and other ancillary buildings adjacent to Hangar 1 and between Hangar 1 and the Portway (now all demolished). All these buildings belonged to the World War I phase of the airfield's development. The buildings were used by Edgley for the design and manufacture of the Edgley Optica light observation aircraft and the airfield used to undertake test flying using the runway currently in existence and as defined by the Ministry of Defence in the 999-year lease.
In 1982 a licence was granted to Wiltshire Aerospace Club (later Old Sarum Flying Club) to occupy Hangar 3 and the airfield. This was turned into a lease in April 1985.
In 1986 the insolvent Optica business was purchased by Matthew Hudson to save it from closure and he renamed it Brooklands Aerospace Group, which continued the building and flying of Optica aircraft, and took on other aerospace sub-contracting activities for McDonnell Douglas and British Aerospace. In 1986 Brooklands obtained a CAA licence for the airfield which formally defined the runway position and allowed flying training to be carried out (initially by the Wiltshire Aerospace Club). In 1989, the Bustard Flying Club moved to Boscombe Down, and has resided there ever since.
Following the destruction of Hangar 1 by fire in 1987, Brooklands purchased Hangar 3 (the easternmost hangar). In 1989 the airfield lease and Hangar 3 was purchased by Blanefield Investments and Brooklands continued aircraft manufacture in Hangar 2 for a short period before moving manufacture to Hurn airport (now Bournemouth Airport).
Old Sarum also played host to the Dorset Gliding Club from October 1981, using Slingsby T.21 gliders and an ex-MOD mobile hangar, before moving to Eyres Field in 1989.
2001 to 2019.
Old Sarum Flying Club operated as a civilian flying club from May 1992, offering a variety of training, until ceasing to exist in May 2008. At the turn of the century, the club operated 20 aircraft, including a 1943 Boeing Stearman, and had over 800 members.
Subsequently, a new organisation called Old Sarum Flying School provided flying training along school rather than club lines. OSFS operated Piper PA-28s and Aero AT-3s, until the business was rebranded as GoFly UK in February 2013, as a sister company to the Old Sarum-based GoSkyDive. AirSport UK and the Shadow Flight Centre provided training on the Ikarus C42, Sky Arrow and CFM Shadow aircraft. The APT Charitable Trust provided flight training for physically disabled pilots, also using the CFM Shadow. Tiger Moth training and trial lessons were also provided by GoFly.
GoSkyDive (formerly SkyDive South Coast) began paradropping operations at Old Sarum in 2009, and operates a Cessna 208 in that role today, having previously used GA8 Airvan, Cessna 172 and Cessna 206 aircraft.
Salisbury District Council first designated Old Sarum Airfield a conservation area in January 2001. This decision was challenged in the High Court which held it to be unlawful, on the basis that there had been procedural errors in its making. The conservation area designation was therefore removed in December 2001. Changes in procedures for the creation of conservation areas allowed the airfield to be designated once more as a conservation area by Salisbury District Council in February 2007.
Hangar 1 has been used by the Boscombe Down Aviation Collection museum since July 2012.
In 2014 the site owners made public proposals regarding the regeneration of the airfield, on the basis that it would make the airfield commercially viable and secure its future. The proposals included a new visitor centre, air traffic control tower, corporate spaces and restaurant. The development would include 310 new homes on vacant land on the north western fringe of the airfield called Sarum Landings and 150 homes to the south of the field called Sarum Field.
Since 2019.
It was announced in a letter to aircraft owners in July 2019 that Old Sarum Airfield would close on 31 October 2019, due to seven-figure losses reported by the airfield's owners. This followed a five-year planning battle between Old Sarum Airfield Limited and Wiltshire Council. The proposal by the company was to build 462 houses on the perimeter of the airfield, which would help to fund a £3m investment into a flying hub. Local people formed a "SOS – Save old Sarum" group and campaigned to stop the 462 houses being built, in order to preserve the airfield, the conservation area and its history. The airfield duly closed on 31 October 2019 and its future is uncertain.
In January 2023, according to the Old Sarum Airfield Ltd website, the airfield was still operational, but only by prior arrangement.
In January 2024, most of the roof of Hangar 3 collapsed during Storm Ischa. Earlier that month, Old Sarum Airfield Ltd had submitted a planning application to repair and refurbish the hangar; the cost of the proposed work was reported to be £3million. In April 2025, the rest of Hangar 3 and its attached buildings were destroyed by a fire.
Boscombe Down Aviation Collection.
The Boscombe Down Aviation Collection (BDAC) museum relocated from MoD Boscombe Down in July 2012, and took up residence in Hangar 1. The collection has many static aircraft exhibits, and in 2014 expanded into a second hangar to allow operational vintage aircraft to be associated with the collection whilst still flying from Old Sarum.
A number of complete and partial aircraft in the collection have links to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment which operated from 1918 to 1992 at Boscombe Down. Volunteers have built, refurbished or recreated several historic aircraft including a Westland Scout helicopter and the front section of a Lancaster bomber. They also built a replica Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2B, the first aircraft to land at Boscombe Down Airfield in 1917. Other exhibits are on loan from the RAF Museum.
The museum is run by Boscombe Down Aviation Collection Limited, a company limited by guarantee and a registered charity.

Isle of Wight/Sandown Airport is an unlicensed aerodrome located west of Sandown, Isle of Wight, England. It is close to the village of Lake.
Isle of Wight Sandown Aerodrome formerly had a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P883) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Isle of Wight Aviation Limited).
Fire damage and recovery.
On 8 October 2006 at 13:15 GMT, a major fire started in a hangar containing highly flammable materials.
One year later, during the early hours of 31 December 2007, a fire started in the kitchen of the Aviator Restaurant. This destroyed most of the newly built clubhouse and restaurant. It was thought at first that arson may have been the cause of the fire, but investigation found that it had been caused by two gas cylinders in the kitchen.
Following a major decline in revenue as a result of the fire, the airport was sold to a London property developer, who intended to build a holiday camp on the site. Plans to build on the site were denied.
In May 2013 the airport was purchased by two aviation enthusiasts who planned to promote the airfield. Landing fees were reduced and a supply of aviation fuel introduced.
Sandown started to gain popularity after owner Danial Subhani started to "revamp" the airfield. The addition of an artificial grass runway allowed year-round operation, and a new airfield bistro featuring a pizza oven proved popular with pilots and visitors alike.
In 2021, aviation flight planning app "Sky Demon" introduced a feature to rank pilots' favourite airfields, in which Sandown ranked first.

Sherburn-in-Elmet Airfield

Sherburn-in-Elmet Airfield is located east of Sherburn in Elmet village and west of Selby, North Yorkshire, England.
Pre-War and Wartime history.
In the 1920s, the Yorkshire Aeroplane Club began operating here. The novelist, pilot, and aeronautical engineer Nevil Shute was a member, and on the club's management committee. At the time, the club was flying de Havilland Moths. In his memoir, "", Shute records that ". . . the Yorkshire Club quickly attracted a fair cross-section of young Yorkshire men and women, so that a Sunday spent at the Club was a merry Sunday." He also met his future wife, Frances Mary Heaton, a physician, at the club. After establishing Airspeed Ltd., an aircraft manufacturing firm, he personally flew the first two test flights of the company's first aircraft here. It was a glider, known as the Tern, and was launched using a "very old Buick car" pulling a steel cable.
During the Second World War the airfield was used as a Royal Air Force station. From 1940 Blackburn Aircraft used a Ministry of Aircraft Production factory here to build 1699 Fairey Swordfish naval torpedo aircraft.
The Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment (AFEE) was moved from RAF Ringway to Sherburn on 17 June 1942. It was charged with developing the means to deploy allied airborne forces and supplies on operations by Military glider, Parachute and other means. The AFEE moved to RAF Beaulieu on 4 January 1945.
The following units were also here at some point:
Post-war operations.
Post-war, Sherburn has been used by private pilots and by aero clubs for training and leisure flying. The Yorkshire Aeroplane Club was based here for many years and organised several international air rallies in the early 1950s.
In addition to the listed runways, there is a closed/un-maintained paved former runway parallel to, and about northwest of, the current 06/24 grass runway.

RAF Sleap.
Sleap (pronounced "Slape") is an ex-Royal Air Force airfield, which was opened in April 1943, and used by RAF advanced flying training units. Initially it was the base for No. 81 Operational Training Unit RAF (81 OTU) within No. 93 Group RAF (93 Gp) of RAF Bomber Command equipped with Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bomber aircraft.
From 1 January 1944 Sleap was assigned to No.38 Group RAF (38 Gp). 81 OTU's Armstrong-Whitworth Whitleys towed Airspeed Horsa heavy troop-carrying gliders on training missions; the Horsas making practice formation landings at RAF Sleap to simulate attacks in enemy territory. Vickers Wellingtons replaced the Whitleys from November 1944 and by January 1945 the strength was 51 Wellington T.Xs, used to train Transport Command air-crew. The RAF finally released Sleap in 1964, but the location is still used as a relief airfield by nearby RAF Shawbury for Juno and Jupiter aircraft from the DHFS as part of the UKMFTS.
The following units were also here at some point:
The Shropshire Aero Club members' bar (also a cafe open to the public) at Sleap is named Eric Lock Lounge after Bayston Hill born Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock the World War II Battle of Britain pilot who was the highest scoring British-born pilot with sixteen and a half victories during the epic battle. There is also the Wartime Aircraft Recovery Group museum open at weekends.

Little Gransden Airfield is an unlicensed airfield located near the village of Little Gransden, southeast of St Neots, Cambridgeshire, England.
Little Gransden Airfield is located in the grounds of Fuller's Hill Farm. It is also the home of Yak UK Ltd., who import, service and sell the Yakovlev range of piston engined aerobatic aircraft.
Location.
Pilots climbing out on runway 28 will be able to see the disused runways of RAF Tempsford on the left side just before the railway. RAF Tempsford was a secret airfield operated by the Special Operations Executive during World War II. Nearby are other former RAF airfields: Gransden Lodge Airfield, now home to the Cambridge Gliding Club; and Bourn.
Events.
Each summer the airfield is home to Little Gransden Families Day Out Air &amp; Vintage Vehicle Show which raises money for the Children in Need charity. The 2012 show, the 20th annual event, took place on 26 August, raising over £26000.
Planning controversy.
In 1992 South Cambridgeshire District Council served a planning contravention notice on the airfield, which had been operating since 1966. The council was supported by a local pressure group Cambridgeshire Airfields Action Group (CAAG). In 1995 the council served a planning enforcement notice. The airfield, supported by planning consultant Peter Kember and some of some local villagers, argued at a public enquiry that they were operating lawfully based on 10 years' continuous use.
The airfield's planning appeal succeeded in 1999 and the airfield was allowed to continue operating. Furthermore, in 2002 Peter Kember succeeded in challenging South Cambridgeshire District Council's Small Airfields Policy which attempted to put further restrictions on Little Gransden and other airfields in the area.

Tatenhill Airfield

Tatenhill Airfield is a licensed airfield operated by Tatenhill Aviation Ltd. Its CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P813) allows flights for the public transport of passengers and for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee, Tatenhill Aviation. The three runways are paved, but one is no longer operational, and a second is used only occasionally. Running east–west, the main runway is the longest.
The airfield is part of the Needwood Survey, a 3000 hectare (12 sq miles) estate held by the Duchy of Lancaster in the area of the former Needwood Forest. The airfield lies 6 miles west of Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England, and is 11 miles south-west of Derby Airfield (a grass airfield with a flying school).
History.
Royal Air Force.
Construction of the airfield was completed in 1941 during the Second World War, using the standard RAF specification of three co-intersecting runways. During the construction phase Miles Magister aircraft of No. 16 Elementary Flying Training School from RAF Burnaston used part of the airfield as a Relief Landing Ground. From 1941 until 1942 the airfield was a satellite for RAF Lichfield where No. 27 Operational Training Unit, Bomber Command used Vickers Wellington and Avro Anson aircraft. From 1942 until 1943 No. 15 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Training Unit RAF, Flying Training Command used the Airspeed Oxford. From 1943 until 1944 No. 5 (P) AFU used the Miles Master. From 1944 until 1945 No. 21 (P) AFU used the Airspeed Oxford, this was to be the last RAF flying unit. During 1944 No. 21 Maintenance Unit arrived after the disastrous explosion at their nearby station of RAF Fauld. The airfield finally housed the RAF School of Explosives from 1945 until 1947. The RAF had completely moved out by 1950 and the airfield became disused. Many of the buildings and structures from this period were extant in 2015.
Allied Breweries.
In 1959 when the ground around the runways was returned to agriculture, the airfield lease was acquired by Allied Breweries of Burton-on-Trent for use in connection with their business, being a suitable location for many of their visitors to fly in directly and also as a base for the brewery to operate their own communications aircraft. During this time they operated: de Havilland Dove, Beech Baron, Beech Queen Air and Beech King Air aircraft. The flying operation ended in 1985.
Current Use.
Tatenhill Aviation.
In 1987, the airfield was taken over by Tatenhill Aviation for General Aviation use and gradually built up to become a viable operation. The field was licensed in the 1990s and a flying school started.
Tatenhill is now a medium-sized general aviation airfield, the north–south (17/35) and southwest–northeast (04/22) runways are now only used for aircraft parking with runway 17/35 featuring a complex of hangars, whereas the east–west (08/26) runway remains operational. A wartime Bellman hangar located at the northeast corner remains in use for aircraft servicing and repairs. The 08/26 runway is licensed for use at length and can handle a wide range of general aviation aircraft, including jets. This runway also has lighting, enabling night flying. A non-directional beacon is installed but there is no let-down procedure. The grass taxiway parallel to the operational runway is used in summer only, because of waterlogging.
Based at the airfield are Tatenhill Flying School, who operate aircraft from Tatenhill Aviation such as the Piper PA-24, Piper PA-28, Cessna 152 and Bellanca Decathlon; and the Merlin Flying Club (Rolls-Royce plc employees') who moved here when Hucknall Aerodrome was closed on 1 March 2015: they operate Cessna 150 Aerobat, Robin DR.200, Auster AOP.9 and Pitts Special aircraft. Central Flight Training school are resident, and provide instructor, commercial, multi-engine and instrument rating training: they operate Piper PA-24, Beech Duchess and Diamond DA-42 aircraft. Each July the airfield hosts a charity fly-in organized by East Staffordshire Flying Club which is also based here.
There is now a helicopter training school, H Helis based at Tatenhill. They provide training in a Schweizer S300CBi.
Many private owners base their aircraft at the airfield. The Midlands Air Ambulance, currently operating a Eurocopter EC135 helicopter, is also based at the airfield. There is a busy M3 aircraft engineering business carrying out aircraft servicing and repairs. There is also a JAR145 approved avionics business. Both Jet A1 and 100LL fuel are available.

Tresco Heliport

Tresco Heliport is a heliport located on the island of Tresco, in the Isles of Scilly off the southwest coast of the United Kingdom. The heliport was served by a scheduled helicopter service from 1983 to 2012, and since 2020 a new scheduled service now operates from the new Penzance Heliport. Currently, Tresco Heliport offers a landing site for private and charter helicopters by private arrangement.
History.
Tresco Heliport had a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P677) that allowed flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee. The aerodrome was not licensed for night use.
The heliport was owned and operated by Tresco Estate, who lease the island from the Duchy of Cornwall. Tresco Heliport was opened by John King, Baron King of Wartnaby, Chairman of British Airways, on 26 April 1983.
Tresco's principal industry is tourism, and the heliport supported this by enabling a scheduled helicopter service to and from the mainland. This scheduled service came to an end in 2012.
On summer weekdays the heliport received up to six flights a day from Penzance Heliport on the mainland, with two services a day in winter. Passengers were conveyed from the heliport to their resort or destination on a passenger carrying trailer drawn by a farm tractor. A footpath from one of the main landing beaches, at Carn Near, to the Abbey Gardens crosses the heliport landing field; it was closed by warning lights and bells a few minutes before a helicopter was due to land at the heliport, and opened again after the helicopter had taken off.
The heliport was officially closed on 31 October 2012 and all commercial flights ceased operations. Private and charter helicopter flights to Tresco were still welcomed by the owner, by prior arrangement.
In 2016, plans were announced for a new helicopter service between a new Penzance Heliport and the Isles of Scilly. The service launched in March 2020 and flights now operate into both St Mary's Airport and Tresco Heliport under the name of Penzance Helicopters, operated by Sloane Helicopters.

Austen Kark

Austen Steven Kark CBE (20 October 1926 – 10 May 2002) was a managing director of the BBC World Service. He was one of three former holders of that post, along with Gerard Mansell and John Tusa, to oppose the plans of John Birt to merge the service into the BBC. After Birt became director general of the BBC in 1992, he had planned to end the service's independent status at Bush House in central London, and absorb it within the rest of the corporation.
Kark had a varied career before his tenure with the BBC. He was the son of a London army major who became a publisher. He attended Upper Canada College in Toronto, the Nautical College in Pangbourne, the Royal Naval College, and Magdalen College, Oxford. He became a Royal Navy midshipman in 1944, serving two years with the East Indies fleet, aboard and HMS "London".
In 1948, at Oxford, Kark directed the first production of Jean-Paul Sartre's "The Flies". He later joined his family's magazine business, Norman Kark Publications. One of its magazines was the glossy literary magazine "Courier". Kark married Margaret Schmahmann in 1949; they had two daughters. The couple divorced in 1954. Kark married novelist Nina Bawden the same year and became stepfather to her two sons. They had one daughter. He became a BBC reporter in 1954 and became head of the South European service at Bush House in 1964. His experiences in South Europe fuelled his interest in the region, particularly Greece; he would later write guidebooks about the country.
Kark moved to the East European and Russian service in 1972. The following year he became Editor of the World Service. He advised the last governor of Rhodesia, Lord Soames, on broadcasting the 1979 election in that country.
He became controller of engineering services in 1974. In 1980, he chaired the Harare government report on radio and television in Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe. In 1981, he began a two-year tenure as Deputy Managing Director of External Broadcasting. He was promoted to Managing Director in 1984, exactly 30 years after he joined the BBC.
Kark was the man-in-the-middle of another great BBC controversy – the launching of the BBC World television service to complement its radio counterpart. The idea was first mooted by Kark's predecessor, Douglas Muggeridge – the nephew of the broadcaster Malcolm Muggeridge. Kark retired in 1986.
Kark was a man of broad interests, especially involving southern Europe and the Commonwealth. He became a trustee of the Commonwealth Journalists Association in 1993. In retirement, he wrote "Attic in Greece" (1994), and "The Forwarding Agent" (1999), a spy thriller set in the Middle East that was praised by the crime writer PD James, an old friend. Most of his book was written at his home in Nauplion, a small town in the Peloponnese, where he and his wife Bawden spent much of their time. In London, the couple lived in Islington, in a house backing on to the Regent's Canal. His hobbies included real tennis, travelling and studying mosaics. He was a member of the Oriental Club and MCC, and was appointed CBE in 1987.
Austen Kark died on 10 May 2002, aged 75, during the Potters Bar rail crash.

Today the airfield has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P681) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Radarmoor Limited). It is primarily a general aviation (GA) airfield. Wellesbourne Mountford is also home to Avro Vulcan XM655, which is kept in taxiable condition.
History of the airfield.
Royal Air Force.
The airfield was originally opened in 1941, constructed in the typical Class A airfield design, the main unit to use the airfield was No. 22 Operational Training Unit RAF which flew Vickers Wellingtons and Avro Ansons for RAF Bomber Command from 14 April 1941 until 24 July 1945.
During the Second World War the airfield was attacked several times by enemy bombers on their way home after bombing targets in the Midlands such as Coventry and Birmingham. The nearby Ettington railway station was used to transport troops and munitions from the rest of the country then to the airfield using RAF lorries and buses. Crews also attacked a number of German cities such as Cologne, Essen and Bremen as part of the 1,000 bomber raids. The aircraft were crewed by instructors and students with some planes failing to return.
The airfield was briefly home to the No. 3 Glider Training School which started using Wellesbourne Mountford during July 1945 preparing for war in the far east using the General Aircraft Hotspur before being disbanded on 3 December 1947, No. 9 Advanced Flying Training School from 1951 to 1954 with Airspeed Oxford's, North American Harvard's and de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk's, the RAF School of Photography from 1948 to 1963 with Anson's, the RAF School of Education 1950 to 1952 and the Airfield Construction Branch from 1951 to 1964. In 1964 the airfield was closed and put on a care and maintenance basis due to the local flying pattern being too close to the V bomber force at RAF Gaydon around to the east, then returned to the original owners.
Civilian use.
The airfield has been reduced in size following the closure of the RAF station with a large number of the pan dispersals and dispersal track being removed in the 1970s for civilian construction projects and with the removal of one runway (which is now a concrete taxiway) and the shortened length of another. In the past, Wellesbourne was temporarily home to Air Atlantique Douglas DC-3s between 1965 and 1981 also the site was used for vehicle testing by the Rootes Group, Coventry and a number of different groups occupied the site for uses like microlighting.
Current use.
Today the airfield has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P681) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Radarmoor Limited).
Wellesbourne Mountford also has an annual wings and wheels event where military and classic cars meet with various aircraft including the in-house Avro Vulcan bomber XM655.
The airfield holds a large market held on Saturdays and Bank Holidays on the eastern side. The airfield also has a café and a number of flying schools located near to the control tower.
The airfield is currently under threat from developers who want to build 1,600 homes on the site.
Accidents and incidents.
In 2010 a small plane crashed on the A429 near to the airfield. The aeroplane was doing circuits around the airfield.
On Tuesday 6 August 2013 a two-seater Van's Aircraft RV-9 diesel powered aircraft suffered an engine failure shortly after takeoff. The pilot executed a forced landing into a nearby field (near Loxley) which resulted in the aircraft smashing through a hedgerow and inverting. The pilot, who was 59 and had 10 years flying experience, was trapped for 40 minutes whilst emergency services tried to locate the crash site. The pilot escaped with just a "bloody thumb".
On Friday 16 September 2022, XM655 (piloted by Wg Cdr Mike Pollitt) suffered a runway excursion when performing a ground run as practice for the following Sunday's public show. This was due to a faulty air speed indicator, which resulted in the aircraft remaining at full power for approximately 2 seconds longer than intended. This resulted in excessive speed and less distance in which to stop, and the aircraft passed beyond the end of the runway – stopping just before the airfield perimeter which borders the B4086. The air speed indicator had been tested and found satisfactory six days before the incident, which had started to work normally before the end of the run. The aircraft's brakes worked properly but were unable to bring the aircraft to a stop with the reduced space available.
Wellesbourne Wartime Museum.
The airfield is also home to the Wellesbourne Wartime Museum situated at the end of the car park near to the control tower which includes the Avro Vulcan XM655 which is located separately in the northwest corner of the airfield and maintained by the 655 Maintenance &amp; Preservation Society.

Netherthorpe Airfield

Netherthorpe Aerodrome is located west by north of Worksop, Nottinghamshire, England. The aerodrome is in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham close to the village of Thorpe Salvin.
Netherthorpe Aerodrome is part of a local landowner's estate. The aerodrome is operated by Sheffield Aero Club which has three hangars, numbers 1 to 3. Other aircraft, including the club's training aircraft, are parked outside. Aircraft maintenance is available from Dukeries Aviation Ltd, which operates from the single maintenance hangar. Netherthorpe Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P601) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Sheffield Aero Club Limited).
History.
The first 'Privateers' and Sheffield Aero Club.
The land on which the current aerodrome is located was originally used for flying in 1933 by a small number of private pilots with their own aircraft. They operated the de Havilland DH.60 Moth. They approached Sheffield City Council on Friday 5 April 1935 with the intention of taking advantage of the growing trend in aerodrome development and forming the Sheffield Aero Club (SAC). Following protracted negotiations, funding was found for a clubhouse which was located to the right of the existing runway 24 threshold and to upgrade an existing hangar, located to the left of the existing runway 24 threshold; this was extant until 1996 when it was destroyed by high winds. The landing ground also received upgrade. The convention at the time was to take off and land using the whole mown field with no designated runways. A white circle was whitewashed to identify the centre of the field where take off and landing was conducted through the circle, the identification letters 'NT' were enclosed in the circle. After initial hesitation mitigated by hedge removal to reveal a larger landing area, Air Ministry (AM) approval was granted to allow flying training, operating the de Havilland Moth which was loaned to the club by its chairman, Mr Jakeman, with operations starting on 31 July 1935. BA Swallow G-AEIC moved to Netherthorpe in 1939, owned by the club director Mr Horrox, though it is unclear if this was used by the wider club membership. It was commandeered as a communication aircraft when the Royal Air Force (RAF) arrived at Netherthorpe in 1940. On the declaration of war with Germany on 3 September 1939, an AM telegram was signalled to all flying clubs to cease operations immediately. The aerodrome was closed and studded with wooden spikes to deter landing German aircraft and paratroopers.
Second World War.
Following a signal from No. 22 Group RAF, the first RAF personnel arrived at Netherthorpe on 28 June 1940, the aerodrome anti-landing spikes being removed covertly during the night. The advanced air movement of a flight of Westland Lysander Mk II aircraft of No. 613 Squadron RAF of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force arrived from RAF Odiham shortly afterwards. Once up to strength utilising their Lysanders along with their Miles Magister (L8056) and de Havilland Tiger Moth (N9279) communications aircraft together with the aforementioned civilian BA Swallow, 613 was detailed to patrol the east coast up to 5 miles inland and up to 5 miles out to sea in two areas. Area 'A' patrolled from the river Humber to the Wash and Area 'B' from the Humber to Filey. They were to report on any invasion activity which included photographic reconnaissance. The Lysanders would have been fitted with bombs and used their wheel mounted and rear gunner operated twin .303 machine guns to attack the eastern beaches during any German invasion. Post-war analysis shows the invasion beaches were to be on the English south coast and the 613 patrolled areas did not feature on the initial invasion plans of Operation Sea Lion, though this might have changed as the land battle for Britain unfolded. Though heavily engaged with army co-operation, 613 also flew "Jim Crow" sorties searching for downed RAF aircrew, leading RAF High Speed Launches to the stricken flyers. The Lysanders were dispersed in nearby Scratta woods with field hedges removed to provide access to the airfield (behind the modern airfield building).
The airfield defences were upgraded with six type 22 pill boxes (see British hardened field defences of World War II) built around the airfield perimeter along with slit trenches and three anti-aircraft gun emplacements utilising the Vickers machine gun; two pill boxes were extant in 2016. The Sherwood Foresters manned these defences and were billeted in the loft of Bottom Farm's barn, which was situated close to the perimeter of the airfield. The officers' mess was located at nearby Thorpe Hall in Thorpe Salvin village, with other ranks under canvas including lower ranked officers. Sanitation and water were rudimentary with "going to ground" latrines. The brick SAC clubhouse next to the Thorpe Salvin-Shireoaks road was converted into a guard room and was extant as a private dwelling in 2017.
A fatal accident occurred on 6 September 1940 when Lysander P1692 flown by Pilot Officer Grosvenor Louis Edmonds collided on landing with an army lorry. The Lysander's wheels snagged the hoop supports for the canvas covering of the lorry. Edmonds died of his injuries in hospital on 13 September 1940. His air gunner Sgt. Letham was rescued and survived. The lorry's driver, Private Donald Goodall of the 9th Battalion of the Sherwood Foresters, was killed. Ignoring the exploding ammunition and fire, LAC Richard John Farley and AC1 Thomas William Coop were the RAF ground crew who rescued Edmonds and Letham from the aircraft. They were later awarded the George Medal for their actions.
On 7 September 1940, 613 moved to nearby RAF Firbeck and Netherthorpe was left with obstacles to deter enemy aircraft from landing but with a known emergency landing area for a Lysander if required. In May 1941, while stationed at Firbeck, 613 started practising high and low level dive bombing strategies and a large target outline of a battleship was painted on the ground at Netherthorpe. After 1941, although the RAF retained operation of the airfield, there was virtually no activity.
Post-war use.
In 1945, No.24 Glider School RAF operated from the airfield, utilising the Cadet TX.1, TX.2 and TX.3 (see Slingsby Kirby Cadet) and the Sedbergh TX.1 (see Slingsby T.21). In 1951, the RAF relinquished control of the airfield and it was handed back to the landowner, the glider unit moving to RAF Lindholme. Little use of the airfield was made until 1961 when the SAC reformed.
Current use.
In 1961, the SAC reformed at Netherthorpe operating out of the former clubhouse/RAF guardroom. This was later converted into a private residence with the current clubhouse being built in the 1970s. Assets consist of an operations block, clubhouse (the Skyways Bar which is fully licensed for food and drink) with a garden leading out onto the airfield, four hangars (one used for aircraft maintenance and another incorporating the fire tender shed), a control tower and a 100LL fuel bowser.
"Ab initio" training for LAPL, PPL and microlight licences is available at the airfield.
Operational pilots either fly their own aircraft, join syndicates or hire aircraft from the flying school.
Various social events are organised during the year.
Air experience flights and introductory flights are available for members of the public where applications for membership are encouraged.
During the late 1990s, Phoenix Flying School was established by Dukeries Aviation Ltd operating from the maintenance hangar where it also provided flying training. On 23 January 2020, Dukeries announced that its school would close on 28 February 2020, leaving the Sheffield Aero Club as the only flying school at Netherthorpe. On 1 November 2023, 3 Counties Flying School took over the provision of flight training at the airfield.

Yeovil/Westland Airport

Yeovil Aerodrome , sometimes known as Yeovil/Westland (to avoid confusion with nearby RNAS Yeovilton), is located in Yeovil, Somerset, England, west of the town centre.
Yeovil Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P482) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Westland Helicopters Limited).
History.
In 1915 the Westland Aircraft Works was founded as a division of Petters Limited in response to government orders for the construction under licence of initially 12 Short Type 184 seaplanes, followed by 20 Short Type 166 aircraft. The name "Westland" was chosen by Mrs Petter as new land purchased as part of an expansion in 1913 at West Hendford which had been earmarked for a new foundry, but ended up becoming the centre for aircraft production. Initially these were seaplanes dispatched in crates, but for landplanes a runway was needed so that they could fly out to where they were needed and therefore more land was purchased next to the factory. Orders for other aircraft followed during the First World War, including the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, the de Havilland designed Airco DH.4, Airco DH.9 and Airco DH.9A and the Vickers Vimy. For the Vimy the company built a new erecting shop which had an unsupported roof span of , at the time the largest building of its kind in Britain. As a result of the experience gained in manufacturing aircraft under licence, Westland began to design and build its own aircraft, starting with the Westland N.1B in 1917, which was followed in 1918 by the Wagtail and the Weasel.
Before the Second World War, Lysanders and Hawker Hectors were built at the site and flew from the airstrip, and after the start of the war the Whirlwind, Welkin, Spitfires and Wyvern followed. The airfield was also used for repair and servicing for a range of aircraft. Despite the airfield being camouflaged it was bombed on several occasions by the Luftwaffe.
After the war, fixed wing aircraft production was scaled back and the site specialised in helicopters, which can still be seen on test and evaluation flights.

<doc id="6946864" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6946864" title="Spirit of the Winter War">
Spirit of the Winter War

The Spirit of the Winter War (, ) is the national unity that had been credited with having saved Finland from disintegrating along class and ideological lines under the invasion of the Soviet Union during the Winter War from November 30, 1939, to March 13, 1940.
The Spirit of the Winter War is significant because it demonstrated that Finnish society had partially healed after the Finnish Civil War of 1918, one of the bloodiest civil wars in European history. Legislation and the democratic political process helped to decrease the gaps in income and other aspects between different classes of society. In the 1920s and the 1930s, the Social Democrats had participated in several governments, including the one in power in November 1939.
After the Winter War began, Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin established a puppet regime in Terijoki in hopes that Finnish workers would join and assist the Soviet invasion and its puppet government. However, the Terijoki Government, led by a communist leader of the civil war, Otto Wille Kuusinen, received no sympathy from the Finnish labour movement. Instead, the Finnish people rallied to defend their homeland against invasion, regardless of political affiliation.
Background.
In Finnish society, the international political calculations of both the upper class and the working class had just been upset by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on August 23, 1939. Until then, many Finns of the upper and the middle classes had believed that Germany would eventually aid Finland against the Soviet Union as Imperial Germany had done in 1915 to 1918. Many workers believed that the Soviet Union was a guarantee for peace and a force against the Nazi Germany.
The socialists now witnessed the Soviets invading Poland instead of fighting against the Nazis. Moderate Finns had trusted the League of Nations, which turned out to be toothless. Thus, on the eve of war, there was very little trust left in any foreign power: socialist internationalism, the German military or assistance from Western Europe.
Significance.
"Talvisodan henki" was coined after the Winter War to be used in domestic and foreign politics when national unity and consensus was needed to face challenges ahead. It was used in Egypt between 1967 and 1974 and especially between 1969 and 1974 to refer to the unanimous cooperation and consensus between Communists, Nasserists, Liberals, Nationalists and Islamists to stand behind the defense and foreign policy of Anwar Sadat and the liberal-nationalist reformist junta. It has continued to be invoked in Finland, but while the workers and peasants who had been on the losing socialist side in the civil war appear to have genuinely bought into the nationalist sentiment, the feeling of reconciliation does not seem to have been universal in White circles.
In 2005, researcher Jukka Kemppinen hypothesised that the Army High Command and General Staff, still dominated by the tsarist-era aristocratic officer corps, with a disproportionate representation of Finns of Swedish and German origin, had deliberately assigned conscripts from Red villages in highly-disproportionate numbers to cannon fodder infantry and sapper/pioneer battalions, which took significantly more casualties than the average.
Kemppinen's claim was countered by Heikki Ylikangas with the argument that less-educated conscripts were more likely to be assigned to the high-risk infantry units than the more technical field artillery, signals, or technical units, which relied on mathematical and literacy skills. Also, the casualty rates were even higher among the officers and NCOs, which were exclusively White positions.

<doc id="6946866" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6946866" title="Kallana">
Kallana

Kallana is a suspected species of dwarf elephant allegedly found in South India. Kaani tribals dwelling in the rainforests of the Western Ghats (Kerala, India) claim that there are two distinct varieties of elephants in the Peppara forest range, one the common Indian elephants ("Elephas maximus indicus"), and the other a dwarf variety which they call "kallana". The name "kallana" comes from the words "kallu", which means stones or boulders, and "aana", which means elephant. The tribals gave the creatures this name because they see the smaller elephant more often in the higher altitudes where the terrain is rocky. Some tribals also call the delicate creatures "thumbiana" ("thumbi" means "dragonfly") for the speed with which the pachyderms run through trees and rocks when disturbed.
Behaviour and diet.
According to the Kani tribals, the pygmy elephants feed on grass, bamboo leaves, tubers and the barks of smaller trees. Like all elephants, they enjoy bathing in rivers and they too have dust baths. Unlike larger elephants, however, they seem able to negotiate steep, rocky inclines.
Sightings and claims of existence as a distinct species.
The existence of a pygmy variety of elephant in India is yet to be scientifically ascertained. If the claims of Kani tribals are believed there are ample reasons to believe that the "kallana" they describe is a different (namely pygmy) variety of elephant since it is claimed to grow to a maximum height of 5 feet (1.5 metres), and they do not mix with the more common Indian elephants, even taking pains to avoid them. In all other respects, they look like Indian elephants.
Sali Palode, a Kerala-based wildlife photographer, and Mallan Kani, a member of Kerala's Kani tribe, who were in search of this elusive elephant were able to photograph one such dwarf elephant, and even claim to have seen a herd. On 17 March 2010, the same Mallan Kani guided the photographer Benny Ajantha to a kallana and he took pictures. This was reported in the Malayalam daily Malayala Manorama with a picture, but one needs to be captured and tested to see whether it is a separate species. The Kerala Forest Department has recently deputed search teams to the forests of Agasthyavanam, Neyyar and the Peppara Wildlife Sanctuaries to search for the pygmy elephants.
Video footage by Sali Palode and Dr Kamaruddheen attained media attention as well as government officials in studying about this, to confirm whether this is a new species. Some of the criticisms from experts is that all the sightings have been of solitary animals. This could be a sign of genetic aberration rather than a separate species. In 2013, a dwarf individual belonging to "Elephas maximus" was observed in Udawalawe National Park in southern Sri Lanka and scientifically documented.

Denis Žvegelj

Denis Žvegelj (born 24 June 1972) is an ex-Slovenian rower and Olympic medallist. He was born in Jesenice, SR Slovenia.
Rowing career.
Žvegelj started rowing at the age of 12 at local rowing club in his hometown Bled. Serious rowing racing started in the coxless pair with Iztok Čop, when they won two junior world championships (1989, 1990). They finished 2nd in the World Championships in 1991, and won Bronze at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 with Čop (the first Olympic medal for independent Slovenia). In 1993 Žvegelj and Iztok took bronze despite Žvegelj's severe shoulder injury after a bicycle accident. Žvegelj studied at Brown University where he rowed and studied Mechanical Engineering. He was member of Brown's varsity eight, which won National Collegiate Rowing Championship in years 1994 and 1995.
After return for summer holidays in 1994, he was in a car crash that prevented him from finishing the rowing season Čop. A few months later, another rower, Sašo Mirjanič from Slovenian four, died in car accident. So next year Žvegelj joined three boys to qualify for the 1996 Olympics. They took 4th in a close fours race, where all six boats were even almost from start to finish line. That scenario repeated in WRC in France, when Slovenia was called to pick up bronze medal, and later (after detail photo finish examination) moved to 4th place. Due to back problems, he ended his rowing career.
Career.
Žvegelj then focused in working with his father in their design firm Basing in Jesenice, which moved to Bled in January 2006.
In 1998 he founded an engineering firm Basing. On 16 March 2009 he was elected President of Slovenian Rowing Federation for 2009–2013. From 2012–2014 he was the CEO of Vile Bled. In 2015 he founded Revive Temple Bled.
In 2012 he formed a small Hotel chain at the lake Bled Vile Bled and later extended his work to alternative healing to promote bio-energy healing and learning. In 2015 he began running independent healing, revitalizing and learning center Revive Temple Bled to promote healthy life style and self-healing through proper nutrition, use of bio-energy and detoxification.
Personal life.
Žvegelj is a father of three sons Gal (17 March 1994), Maksim (25 September 1998) and Isak (3 July 2000) and lives in his hometown of Bled.

Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1120

The Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1120 turbojet is a derivative of the F100 turbofan. It was installed as a modification to a single F-4E fighter jet, and powered the canceled IAI Lavi.
Development.
The development of the PW1120, according to Israeli Air Force (IDF/AF) specifications, started in June 1980. It retained the F100 core module, gearbox, fuel pump, forward ducts, as well as the F100 digital electronic control, with only minor modifications. Unique PW1120 components included a wide chord low pressure (LP) compressor, single-stage uncooled low pressure (LP) turbine, simplified single stream augmentor, and a lightweight convergent/divergent nozzle. Full scale testing was initiated in June 1982, and flight clearance of the PW1120 was tested in August 1984. The PW1120 had 70 percent similarity with the F100, so the IDF/AF would not need a special facility for spare parts. It would be built under licence by Bet-Shemesh Engines Limited in Israel.
IAI installed one PW1120 in the starboard nacelle of an F-4E-32-MC of the IDF/AF (Number 334/66-0327) to explore the airframe/powerplant combination for an upgrade program of the F-4E, known as "Kurnass 2000" ("Heavy Hammer") or Super Phantom and to act as an engine testbed for the Lavi. The powerplant was more powerful, and more fuel efficient than the General Electric J79-GE-17 turbojet normally installed in the F-4E. The structural changes included modifying the air inlet ducts, new powerplant attachment points, new or modified powerplant bay doors, new airframe mounted gearbox with integrated drive generators and automatic throttle system. It also included a modified bleed management and air-conditioning ducting system, modified fuel and hydraulic systems, and a powerplant control/airframe interface. It was first flown on 30 July 1986.
Two PW1120 powerplants were installed in the same F-4E and it was flown for the first time on 24 April 1987. This proved very successful, allowing the Kurnass 2000 to exceed Mach 1 without the afterburners, and endowing a combat thrust-to-weight ratio of 1.04 (17 per cent better than the F-4E). This improved the sustained turn rate by 15 per cent, the climb rate by 36 per cent, medium-level acceleration by 27 per cent and low-level speed with 18 bombs from 1,046 km/h to 1,120 km/h (654 - 700 mph or 565 kn to 605 kn). It was demonstrated at the Paris Air Show in 1987.

Sky Broadband

Sky Broadband is the consumer internet service offered by Sky UK in the United Kingdom.
History.
In October 2005, Sky UK agreed to purchase the ISP Easynet for £211 million. At the time, Easynet were one of two companies in the UK that had made major investments in local-loop unbundling (LLU), providing Sky with access to 232 unbundled telephone exchanges. The purchased company was placed under a new Sky division, Sky Broadband. In October 2007, Sky reached the one million mark in terms of customer numbers, and claim to be adding one new customer every 40 seconds. By September 2009, it had 2.3 million customers. By July 2012 Sky had reached four million customers, and unbundled exchanges covering over 70% of the United Kingdom. By January 2017, Sky said it had 6.1 million customers.
Sky agreed on 1 March 2013 to buy the fixed telephone line and broadband business of Telefónica UK, trading under the O2 and BE brands. The company agreed to pay £180 million initially, followed by a further £20 million after all customers have been transferred to Sky's existing Broadband and telephone business. and customers were transferred during 2014.
Networking.
Sky Broadband provides customers with download speeds of up to 900 Mbps via the Openreach network. 
Sky launched Sky Broadband in the Republic of Ireland in February 2013.
Internet Speeds.
As with all DSL connections, the further the distance from the DSLAM (usually located at the telephone exchange) the customer site is, the slower the line speed will be. Sky uses DLM (dynamic line management) over the first ten days of a new connection to set the line at an acceptable downstream and upstream speed in order for the connection to remain stable. Lines are initially connected at 4 Mbit/s and gradually increased over the ten-day "training period" until the line shows signs of instability, this allows Sky to know what speeds the line can handle whilst remaining stable. 
In April 2012, Sky Fibre was launched almost two and a half years after British Telecom launched BT Infinity in January 2010.
In April 2014 it was announced they are to roll out 1 gigabit fibre-to-the-premises connections in the city of York in partnership with rival TalkTalk.
Sky Wireless Hub.
The Sky Wireless Hub is a wireless router distributed to all Sky Broadband customers when they order their Sky Broadband packages.
During 2006, Netgear were the only manufacturer of Sky Broadband routers, which were made in white. From 2008, Netgear and Sagem were the manufacturers of the Sky Broadband routers, made in black and shaped to match the Sky+ HD box. Both routers are also distributed in smaller boxes (The boxes are now the size of the routers) as part of Sky UK’s low carbon scheme in turn reducing postage costs. The Sagem router unlike the Netgear router has added restrictions to features such as the built in inbound firewall settings and outbound and inbound VPN connections. However a firmware upgrade is available upon request, for users wishing to connect to an outbound VPN connection using Sky Broadband, while maintaining restrictions on the inbound firewall and inbound VPN connection.
Towards the end of 2010, D-Link started producing routers for Sky. The D-Link router is the DSL-2640S. 
On Demand.
Sky have created On Demand, which will combine Sky Broadband and Sky+ HD to offer a true on-demand service using the Ethernet socket of the Sky+ HD box and the Sky Broadband router. Sky Customers will be able to connect their Sky router to their Sky+ HD box via an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi adapter, and stream content directly to their television. Unlike other VOD services, On Demand video will count towards a users data usage.
Now Broadband.
Now Broadband (stylised as NOW Broadband) is a brand name of contract-free pricing plans that offer broadband internet and telephone service on a budget. It was launched in Summer 2016 as Now TV Combo, and was rebranded in early 2018 as Now Broadband. It is a brand extension of Sky's Now, an over-the-top internet television service which offers multichannel television and video-on-demand content on a budget.
Controversy.
On 21 September 2010, the website of was subjected to a DDoS attack as part of Operation Payback. After the site came back online a 350 MB file was uploaded containing spreadsheets listing more than 8,000 Sky broadband customers accused of making unauthorized downloads of adult films. This raised issues concerning Sky not following Data Protection Act guidelines.
Broadband Shield.
In March 2014 Samuel L. Jackson and the other stars of "" appeared in advertisements for the 'Sky Broadband Shield' web blocking product.
Sky Talk Shield.
In June 2017 Sky launched a free nuisance call blocking service as an optional extra for their landline customers. The service screens calls automatically before the phone rings, preventing robot callers. Customers are played a recording of the caller's name and given the option to either accept the call, reject it or send to voicemail.
As was common for Sky Broadband marketing campaigns during the 2010s, the launch was promoted with an advert featuring a tie in with a film franchise, in this case, Despicable Me 3.

Sanicula epipactis

Sanicula epipactis (syns Hacquetia epipactis, Dondia epipactis) is a species of flowering plant of the family Apiaceae, native to Europe. Under the synonym "Hacquetia epipactis", it was the only species in the monotypic genus Hacquetia.
It grows in moist, shady woodland habitats. It is a rhizomatous, clump-forming herbaceous perennial, growing to about 30 cm in height, with glossy green leaves which only fully develop after flowering. The flowers, appearing late winter and early spring, consist of multiple tiny yellow florets framed by lime green bracts, and carried in dense spherical umbels 4 cm in diameter. It is easy to cultivate in Plant Hardiness Zones 5 to 7 according to the United States Department of Agriculture (though it is hardier than indicated and can be grown easily down to at least Zone 3), and looks best in a woodland setting which imitates its native habitat.
This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
Known cultivars include the variegated ‘Thor’.
The specific name "epipactis" comes from a Greek word for plants thought to curdle milk.

Sprinter (British Rail)

The Sprinter is a family of diesel multiple unit trains in use on the British railway system. They were built in the 1980s and early 1990s by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL), Metro-Cammell and Leyland. Sprinters operate in almost every part of Great Britain, from rural branch lines to commuter expresses into major cities. 
The class includes class 150, 151, 153, 154, 155, 156, 158 and 159. Most have Cummins engines with Voith hydraulic transmissions, although 47 Class 158 units have Perkins engines instead.
Originally British Rail coined the "Sprinter" name for the units, mainly to promote the superior acceleration capabilities of the units compared with the first-generation DMUs they replaced. Advertisements such as "The Sprinters are coming" were locally advertised in newspapers when these trains were scheduled to be introduced. Great play was also made of, in many cases, reduced journey times.
Background.
By the beginning of the 1980s, British Rail (BR) operated a large fleet of first generation DMUs, which had been constructed in prior decades to various designs. While formulating its long-term strategy for this sector of its operations, British Rail planners recognised that there would be considerable costs incurred by undertaking refurbishment programmes necessary for the continued use of these aging multiple units, particularly due to the necessity of handling and removing hazardous materials such as asbestos. In light of the high costs involved in retention, planners examined the prospects for the development and introduction of a new generation of DMUs to succeed the first generation.
In the concept stage, two separate approaches were devised, one involving a so-called "railbus" that prioritised the minimisation of both initial (procurement) and ongoing (maintenance &amp; operational) costs, while the second was a more substantial DMU that could deliver superior performance than the existing fleet, particularly when it came to long-distance services. The initial specification developed for the latter type was relatively ambitious for the era, calling for a maximum speed of 90 mph (145 km/h), a rate of acceleration compatible to contemporary EMUs, the ability to couple/work in multiple with existing EMUs, facilitate through-access for passengers, feature pressure ventilation, the ability to assist another failed unit, and to comprise either a three or four-car consist.
This specification led to the development of the experimental British Rail Class 210 DMU. However, to deliver the performance specified, it was found that relatively expensive equipment had to be used, particularly to provide sufficient speed, acceleration, and through-passenger access; it also had maintainability problems due to space limitations. Despite these shortcomings, it was recognised that a production fleet that was assembled from proven components would possess both a greater reliability level and lower maintenance costs; it was forecast to achieve an availability rate of 85 percent. As such, the type had sufficiently demonstrated a promising reduction in maintenance costs was achievable, especially once initial teething problems were dealt with, as well as the wider value represented by a new generation of DMUs in the reduction of ongoing costs for BR.
By 1983, experiences with the Class 210 had influenced planners to favour the procurement of a new generation of DMUs, but to also adopt a new set of specifications that were somewhat less demanding than the prior set. Specifically, it was decided to drop the top speed from 90 mph to 75 mph, as testing had revealed the higher speed did not deliver any perceivable improvement in journey times due to the typically short spacing of the stations the type was intended to serve. Furthermore, it was determined that a propulsion system delivering 7 hp per tonne would deliver sufficient acceleration. The requests for compatibility with other rolling stock were eliminated, although auto-coupling and auto-connecting functionality was added. In addition to a good ride quality, the specification included a sound level of 90 dB when at full speed, an operational range of 1,000 miles, and an interval between major overhauls of five years or 350,000 miles.
In comparison to the prior generation of DMUs, which typically used a pair of engines for each power car, the new generation DMU would only use a single engine per car; sufficient cooling was also provided that even with one failed engine, a two-car unit could continue to perform typical services without incurring a major performance deficient. For an operational perspective, it was intended that the DMU could be assembled akin to building blocks, comprising between two and four cars that may or may not be outfitted with various passenger amenities such as toilets and luggage spaces. 
Initially formalised as a business specification, these requirements were transferred into a relatively broad technical specification that avoided any specifics other than those that were deemed essential for compatibility purposes. Thereafter, it was issued to various rolling stock manufacturers for a competitive tender. As a part of this process, these manufacturers submitted bids to construct an initial series of three-car prototypes as demonstration units. A relatively constrained timetable of only 18 months between the date of order to delivery of these prototypes was also specified; this has been attributed as having restricted manufacturers to overwhelming lean towards existing industrial practices for their submissions.
In response to the specification, several submissions were received by BR. The bid submitted by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) was heavily based on its successful Class 455 EMU, sharing its body and the majority of its running gear, albeit equipped with two different power trains. The railway engineering company Metro-Cammell also bid, offered its own design that employed rivetted aluminium construction; this feature was attributed as enabling a meaningful reduction in weight over conventional methods. BR officials quickly opted to proceed with a pair of prototypes from both BREL and Metro-Cammell, issuing orders to these manufacturers henceforth.
Prototypes.
Two companies, BREL and Metro-Cammell, built 2 x three coach prototypes for the first batch of Sprinters, the Class 150/0 and Class 151.
Production units.
The production units were all built as two coach units, with the exception of 17 Class 158s and the 22 Class 159 units, which were built with an additional centre car. The Class 153 railcars were converted from the two coach Class 155s.
Class 150, 153, 155, and 156 units have no air-conditioning and a top speed of ; Classes 158 and 159 have air conditioning and a top speed of . All units except the first two batches of Class 150s have outer-end gangways, allowing passengers to walk between trains working in multiple.
All trains in the Sprinter family have BSI couplers which allow them to work in multiple with any other trains in the Sprinter family and also , , and units. However, they cannot work in multiple with or units due to incompatible wiring arrangements.
Class 150 "Sprinter".
These were designed as commuter units and are fitted with 5 abreast seating and doors fitted at 1 and 2 thirds down the length of each car, unique amongst the Sprinter family. For the era, the Class 150 provided exceptional ride quality; it also was fully compliant with BR's 50 percent engine-out performance requirements. Early units had no end gangway, therefore in multiple-working with other Sprinter units passengers can not move between units. The 150/2s do feature end gangways, as well as two-by-two airline seating.
150/0.

150/2.
Currently operated by:
Class 950.
In addition to the standard Class 150 units, a single two-car DMU was constructed using the same bodyshell for use as a track assessment unit on stretches of line where heavier stock cannot be safely used. This unit was initially classified as Class 180, but was reclassified in the departmental series as Class 950 upon the entry into service of the Class 180 "Adelante"s.
Class 153 "Super Sprinter".
These single-car units were originally built as two-car Class 155 units by Leyland from 1987 to 1988, but were converted by Hunslet-Barclay at Kilmarnock from 1991 to 1992. The class was built for lightly used lines, replacing first generation single coach units. The conversion involved building a new cab at the original inner ends of the vehicles. The layout of the original non-cab ends was subtly different from the original cab end, so the ends are noticeably different, and the vehicle not symmetrical. The new cab is significantly smaller than the original Leyland cab and pushes back into the door area. Post their passenger careers, some have been converted to track inspection units by Network Rail.
Currently operated by
Class 155 "Super Sprinter".
Early on, it was recognised that the Class 150 would be unsatisfactory in some criteria for more-upmarket services, but that a derivative of the type would likely better handle these services. Thus, such DMUs were built by British Leyland at Workington (using a body construction technology derived from the Leyland National bus) between 1987 and 1988. They have a top speed of . Changes from the Class 150 included discarding openable windows in favour of fully-sealed units, while the external doors were relocated into vestibules at the end of each coach to reduce internal noise levels. Furthermore, the coaches were stretched to provide more internal volume, substituting the two-by-three seating arrangement of the Class 150 with a more roomy two-by-two counterpart. These changes could be implemented without impacting much of the benefits of adopting the existing design, although did result in an increased weight and thus a decreased power-to-weight ratio. Of the original 42 units built, only 7 remain, due to the majority having been converted into the Class 153.
Currently operated by
Class 156 "Super Sprinter".
The Class 156 units were built from 1987 to 1989 by Metro-Cammell at its Washwood Heath Works in Birmingham. The vehicles, like the Class 155s, have a single leaf sliding door at either end of each coach - this feature reflected the anticipated longer journeys (with fewer stops) that the Class 156 was supposed to operate. They have a top speed of . They feature medium density (2+2) seating.
Currently operated by:
Class 158 "Express Sprinter".
The Class 158 "Express Sprinter" units were built from 1989 to 1992 by BREL at Derby Litchurch Lane Works to replace elderly 'heritage' DMUs and locomotive-hauled passenger trains. Compared with previous members of the Sprinter family, specifically the venerable Class 156 Super Sprinter, the Class 158 is much better suited to longer journeys with fewer stops and provides a much quieter and more comfortable environment. They are fully air-conditioned (except the driver's cabs) with provision for a trolley refreshment service and an increased top speed of . They feature medium density (2+2) seating in standard class and, on applicable examples, low density (2+1) seating in first class.
They are mostly fitted with Cummins engines, with the remaining 47 fitted with Perkins engines.
Currently operated by:
and exported versions for State Railway of Thailand (differences include inward opening slam doors rather than plug doors and 4 carriages rather than 2 or 3 in the UK)
Class 159 "South Western Turbo".
These 90 mph trains were originally built as 3 car Class 158s, but converted before entry into service. Twenty-two 3-car units were built for Network SouthEast's West of England and from London Waterloo to Salisbury, Yeovil and Exeter. They were used to replace Class 50 and Class 47 locomotive-hauled passenger trains. Units tend to operate in six or nine coach formations between Waterloo and Salisbury and in three or six coach formations between Salisbury and Exeter. South West Trains used to operate services from London Waterloo to Paignton, Plymouth and Penzance, but all services west of Exeter were withdrawn at the end of 2009.
Some surplus three coach Class 158 units, which were transferred to the West of England route in 2007, were refurbished to Class 159 standards, and reclassified as Class 159/1s.
Currently operated by
Proposed units.
In addition to the production types, there were two types of Sprinter proposed that were in the event not proceeded with.
Class 152 "Super Sprinter".
In the early 1990s, as a cost saving measure on underused rural routes, British Rail proposed converting the 2-car Class 156 into single car units, which were named as Class 152. Although the single car Sprinter did go ahead, it was eventually decided to convert the Class 155, which became the Class 153.
Class 157 "Strathclyde Sprinter".
In the 1990s, Strathclyde Passenger Transport was looking to update the fleet that was used to operate commuter and suburban services in and around Glasgow, with a new Sprinter type intended to be procured, which became Class 157. However, due to British Rail's financial limits at the time leading up to privatisation, these units were not ordered, with Class 170s eventually being procured.
Replacement.
As many "Sprinters" are now 30 years old, train operating companies are beginning to replace them. For example, London Midland decided to replace their Class 150 fleet with Class 172s from 2010.
Class 158s have been augmented or replaced by Class 170 and Class 175 units, allowing these to be cascaded to replace older "Sprinters", which in turn replaced life-expired "Pacer" railbuses. Class 158s still operate the five hour journey from Norwich to Liverpool Lime Street, the three and a half hour Portsmouth Harbour to Cardiff Central and also the four hour Birmingham International to Holyhead journey, replacing Class 175 for use on other long-distance services. Transport for Wales plans to replace its Class 150, 153, and 158 units with CAF Civity diesel multiple units.

Glenn Anthony May

Glenn Anthony May (June 12, 1945– September 8, 2020) was a professor of history at the University of Oregon, where he worked from 1983 to 2015. His area of study included Southeast Asian history (especially of the Philippines), foreign relations of the United States, and Chicano history.
Biography.
May was born in Brooklyn in 1945. May studied at Yale University for his undergraduate degree. After graduating in 1966, he served in the Vietnam War. When his military service was complete, he returned to Yale where he received a PhD in history. He married Helen Liu in 1991 and they have two children.
May's main research focus has been on the History of the Philippines. His works include:
May's work has been influential. His 1980 book, based on his PhD work, was published at a time when US control of the Philippines was generally thought to have led to rather positive results, was much more skeptical of the benefits of American rule. May's 1996 work on the historiography of Andrés Bonifacio attracted controversy, "Inventing a Hero: The Posthumous Re-Creation of Andres Bonifacio". In it, May argued that much of the commonly accepted knowledge of Bonifacio were based on unverifiable or forged documents, and was a myth disconnected from the real Bonifacio. As Bonifacio is a Philippine national icon, this attracted pushback from those who wished to defend the standard version of Bonifacio's story. May also criticized the work of historian John Leddy Phelan on the Philippines under Spanish rule in 2004, in particular his claim that the Spanish began a process of changing communally held property into private property. Rather, May said, old Spanish documents indicate that the disputes of the era involved disputes with existing landholders - while the Spanish did take land, it appears it was from pre-existing owners in the Filipino elite, not from a commons.
May died on September 8, 2020. His ashes are interred at the Eugene Pioneer Cemetery in Eugene, Oregon near the University of Oregon.

Geraghty

Geraghty and Garaghty ( ) are Irish surnames. Originally written in a Gaelic form as "Mag Oireachtaigh" (or "MacGeraghty" in English), the name is derived from the word "oireachtach", referring to a member of an assembly. The name of the modern national legislative body in Ireland, the Oireachtas comes from the same Gaelic root.
History.
The MacGeraghty clan are descended from the Siol Muireadaigh of the Kingdom of Connacht, the same Gaelic lineage and homeland as the Ó Conchubhair dynasty. Their lands were originally situated in the Barony of Roscommon.
They were rulers of Clann Tomaltaigh and the Muintir Roduib and are referred to in the topographical poem Tuilleadh feasa ar Éirinn óigh by Giolla na Naomh Ó hUidhrín. 
Members of this Clan are said to have named the island of Innis Murray after themselves as they were formerly chiefs of the Siol Murray. 
The MacGeraghty clan are associated with the Gaelic Kingdoms of Uí Briúin and Uí Maine, in the latter they were second only to the "O’Ceallaigh", who were the Kings of Uí Maine. 
A Chief of the name, called "McGiriaght" is listed in the Composition Book of Connacht in 1585, as seated in the Barony of Athlone. 
Geoffrey Keating’s "History of Ireland" records that:
""Mac Oiraghty of the steeds was the ruling chief"
"of Muintir Roduiv of rightful laws -" 
"A fearless warrior as he ranged the woods""
The clan name MacGeraghty lead to the anglicised name Geraghty, descendants of the family are still found in large numbers in County Galway, County Mayo, County Roscommon, County Sligo and among the Irish diaspora.

Calcutta (song)

"Calcutta" is a German pop song. An instrumental version by American bandleader and TV host Lawrence Welk on the 1961 Dot Records album "Calcutta!" was a Number One song in the United States, and the most successful hit of Welk's career.
History.
The tune was written in 1958 by the composer Heino Gaze. The original title was "Tivoli Melody", but it was re-titled several times, until it finally was named for the Indian city of Kolkata, known in German as Kalkutta and in English as Calcutta. The German version has lyrics by Hans Bradtke, and is titled "Kalkutta liegt am Ganges" (Calcutta lies on the Ganges). In the English-speaking world, the song was released under the title "Calcutta", and the American songwriting team of Paul Vance and Lee Pockriss wrote English lyrics, celebrating the charms of the "ladies of Calcutta."
Welk's recording of the tune was something of a departure for him. It incorporated his recognizable "trademarks," i.e., the harpsichord lead and an accordion but combined them with handclaps and a brisk rock rhythm.
"Calcutta" stayed atop the US pop chart for two weeks while the album, with its combination of easy listening tunes and covers of then-popular rock singles, charted at #1 for two weeks, spending three months on the chart. At the time "Calcutta" reached #1, Welk, who was 57, became the oldest artist to have a number one pop single in the U.S. (His record would be broken three years later by Louis Armstrong who at age 63 topped the singles charts with "Hello, Dolly!" in early 1964.) "Calcutta" was also a hit on the Hot R&amp;B Sides chart, where it peaked at #10. It proved to be the last top 40 hit of Welk's career.
Dancers Bobby Burgess and Barbara Boylan, cast members on Welk's weekly TV show, worked up a dance routine to go along with "Calcutta", which they performed numerous times on the "Welk" show over the years.
"", a 2022 film, briefly used the song in the background of a scene.
Cover versions.
The Four Preps released a 45rpm single vocal version shortly after Welk's recording in 1961, Capitol Records 4508. It briefly entered the Billboard Hot 100.
Al Caiola released a version on his 1961 album Golden Hit Instrumentals, UAS 6142.
The Ventures released a version on their 1963 Dolton album "The Ventures Play Telstar and the Lonely Bull", BST 8019.
Les Baxter made a version of the song, which was featured in "Volume 3: Space Capades" on the 1960s CD compilation Ultra-Lounge.
There is also a vocal version by Marino Marini, and a French-language cover by Petula Clark, "Ma Fête À Moi".
There are German versions by Vico Torriani, Die Travellers, and Rainhard Fendrich.

Carl, Duke of Württemberg

Carl Herzog von Württemberg ("Carl Maria Peter Ferdinand Philipp Albrecht Joseph Michael Pius Konrad Robert Ulrich"; 1 August 1936 – 7 June 2022) was the head of the House of Württemberg from 1975 to 2022. He was succeeded by his grandson Wilhelm.
Life.
Carl was born in Friedrichshafen on 1 August 1936. He was the second son of Philipp Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg (1893–1975), and Archduchess Rosa of Austria, Princess of Tuscany (1906–1983). He was educated at the classical grammar school in Riedlingen and the University of Tübingen, where he studied law. After graduating, he joined the family estate business, based at Altshausen Palace.
Carl became heir-presumptive to the headship of the House of Württemberg on 29 June 1959, when his older brother, Ludwig, renounced his succession rights. He became head of the family when his father died 15 April 1975. The family company manages around 5500 hectares of forest, around 2000 hectares of meadows and fields, fifty hectares of vineyards, other land in Germany and abroad, forests in Canada and Austria, and company holdings. It also maintains some seventy cultural monuments of the House of Württemberg. The current headquarters of the estate is Friedrichshafen Castle. 
On 7 June 2022, Carl died in a hospital in Ravensburg at the age of 85. He was succeeded by his grandson Wilhelm since Carl's eldest son Friedrich had predeceased him.
Charitable activities.
Carl took part in many social and charitable activities, including the German Red Cross, the Friends of Cancer Children, the Free School Foundation, the Art Foundation, the Preventive Youth Welfare Foundation, and the Baden-Württemberg Monument Foundation, which he chaired from 2002 to 2008. He was Patron of the Society for the Promotion of the State Museum of Württemberg, and chairman of the Friends of the University of Tübingen and the University Foundation. In Altshausen, where he lived, he was Patron of the Citizens Guard Yellow Hussars.
On 30 July 2002 Carl and his wife Diane met with President of Lebanon Emile Lahoud and his wife at the Baabda Palace in Beirut to discuss a project to assist deprived Lebanese children as well as other social and cultural activities.
Marriage and issue.
On 21 July 1960, Carl married Princess Diane d'Orléans (born 1940), the daughter of Prince Henri, Count of Paris, and his wife Princess Isabelle of Orléans-Braganza. The wedding took place at Schloss Altshausen, the ancestral seat of the Dukes of Württemberg.
They had four sons and two daughters and sixteen grandchildren:

Vanaspati

Vanaspati (Devanagari: ) is the Sanskrit word that now refers to the entire plant kingdom. However, according to "Charaka Samhitā" and "Sushruta Samhita" medical texts and the "Vaisesikas" school of philosophy, "vanaspati" is limited to plants that bear fruits but no evident flowers. In the "Rigveda", 9th Mandala, Hymn 5.10, "Vanaspati" (literally meaning: Lord of the Forest) is a deity presiding over the forest and described as the "ever-green, the golden-hued, refulgent, with a thousand boughs."
Concept in Hindu scriptures.
The "Rigveda" divides plants into Vrksha (tree), Oshadhi (herbs useful to humans) and Virudha (creepers). These are subdivided into:
All grasses are separately classified as "Trna", flowering plants are "Puspavati", and the fruit bearing ones are "Phalavati". Leafless plants are placed under the group, "Karira".
Other veda, the "Atharvaveda" divides plants into eight classes:
The "Taittiriya Samhita" and the "Vajasenayi Samhita" texts the plant kingdom is classified into:
In the words of Brahma, the "Manu" classifies plants as
"Charaka Samhitā" and "Sushruta Samhita" medicine texts classify plants into "Vanaspati", "Vrksa" or "vanaspatya", "Virudh" and "Osadhi". This second "Susruta" subdivides Virudhs into "pratanavatya" (creepers with spreading stem on the grounds) and "gulminya" (succulent herbs), whereas the first "Charaka" subdivides Virudhs into "lata" (creeper), "gulma" and "osadhis" into annuals or perennials bearing fruits and grasses which go without fruits. These are further divided into 50 groups based on their physiological actions and diseases they cure. Flowering plants are divided into "sukadhanya" (cereals), "samidhanya" (pulses), "saka varga" (pot herbs), "phala varga" (fruits), "harita varga" (vegetable), "ahayogi varga" (oils), and "iksu varga" (sugarcane).
The Vaisesikas school of philosophy classify plants under seven heads, e.g. "Vrksa", "Trna", "Osadhi", "Gulma", Lata, "Avatana" and "Vanaspati". Defining the characteristics of the various groups Udayana's Kiranavali, remarks that:
Parasara, the author of Vrksayurveda, classifies plants into Dvimatrka (Dicotyledons) and Ekamatrka (Monocotyledons). These are further classified into:
Hydrogenated vegetable oil.
"Vanaspati" or "Banaspati" is also a South Asian slang for Vanaspati/Banaspati ghee of which "Dalda" is the leading brand in Indian markets. Vanaspati is a fully or partially hydrogenated vegetable cooking oil, often used as a cheaper substitute for ghee and butter. In India, vanaspati ghee is usually made from palm oil. Hydrogenation is performed using a catalyst known as "supported nickel catalyst", in reactors at low-medium pressure (3-10 bar). Vanaspati ghee is very high in trans fats, which may compose up to 50% of Vanaspati.

Product sabotage

In marketing and retail, product sabotage is a practice used to encourage the customer to purchase a more profitable product or service as opposed to cheaper alternatives. It is also the practice where a company attempts to aim different prices at different types of customer. There are several methods used in achieving this:
Cheap packaging.
This method is commonly used in supermarkets, where the cheapest products are packaged in cheap and basic packaging. These products are normally displayed alongside the more attractively packaged and expensive items, in an attempt to persuade customers to buy the more expensive alternative instead.
For example, the Tesco supermarket chain sells a "value" range of products in garish (red, blue, and white) packaging to make them appear unappealing and inferior to their regular brand.
Omitting products from menus.
Not promoting cheaper alternatives. An example of this method is coffee companies who hide or downplay cheaper drinks in the hope that customers will buy something pricier. Starbucks and Coffee Republic, who both have a product called "short cappuccino", are known to use this practice. The staff know the product, the tills have a button for it, but the product is not listed on the menu boards. Customers who are not aware of it are likely to purchase one of the more profitable items listed on the menu.
Duplicate manufacture.
Manufacturing two versions of the same product at different prices. In the hi-tech world it is common for companies to produce a high-specification product, sold at a premium price, and then sell the same product more cheaply with some of the functions disabled. IBM did this with a printer in the 1990s, where an economy version for a home user was the top-of-the-range model with a microchip in it to slow it down. 
All versions of Microsoft Vista and Microsoft Windows 7 shipped on an identical DVD and installs the same software regardless of the version purchased by the consumer. However, certain features are hidden or unusable by the user depending on the installation code entered. Upon attempting to use such features, the software will offer an "upgrade" and take an immediate payment from the customer before the features are instantly unlocked without any further installation being required.
The Intel 486DX CPU came with a floating point calculation unit. The 486SX was exactly the same chip with the electrical connections to the floating point unit cut. (Officially this was done to chips where the floating point unit was not working properly, but the CPU was fine. If this was the case it can't be said to be product sabotage.)

Arfak Mountains

The Arfak Mountains () is a mountain range found on the Bird's Head Peninsula in the Province of West Papua, Indonesia.
The term "arfak" came from "arfk" the language of the coastal Biak people, meaning "people who sleep over fire", to refer to how the Arfak warm their houses by putting hot ember below their "Rumah Kaki Seribu". Locally the mountain is called "Gunung Indon" or "Indonga" meaning "big mountain" in Hatam language. Located in the east and central regions of the Bird's Head Peninsula, these mountains rise steeply from the sea, with little or no coastal plain surrounding them. Mount Arfak, at , can be viewed from the provincial capital, Manokwari, and is the highest point in West Papua and the Bird's Head Peninsula.
Since Dutch colonial times the range has been one of the most frequently explored and best known regions of West Papua for bird watching. Along with the Tamrau Mountains in the north, the two ranges have been divided by the grassy Kebar Valley, which is the heartland of many indigenous people, with a variety of backgrounds. Found near the town of Manokwari, the mountains are an important and threatened site of biodiversity, part of the Vogelkop montane rain forests ecoregion. Multiple tribes of indigenous peoples, many who speak mutually unintelligible languages such as Hatam, Meyah and Sougb, all call the Arfak Mountains their home. They ultimately are the guardians of the future of the exquisite, yet increasingly threatened bird species found throughout this rugged region.

Antigone, Montpellier

Antigone is a neighbourhood of Montpellier, France, east of the city centre. It is best known for its architectural design by Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura.
History and design.
The district is built on the grounds of the former Joffre Barracks, of which only Montpellier's citadel remains. In 1977, Mayor Georges Frêche started the process that led to the construction of the district.
The district's architect was the Spaniard Ricardo Bofill and his Taller de Arquitectura. He designed a series of grand neo-classical structures, enlarging classical motifs such as pediments, entablatures and pilasters to gigantic scale. The district is located between the old centre of Montpellier and the river Lez. On the opposite side of the river is the "Hôtel de la Région Languedoc-Roussillon", another Bofill design. Together they make for a unified visual axis one kilometre in length, nicknamed "the Champs-Élysées of Montpellier".
After Antigone, more sites on this side of Montpellier were developed.
The buildings consist mostly of low-income housing, public facilities and local shops.
The Antigone project, on a 36-hectare plot, has been one of the largest single developments completed in France and attracted worldwide interest. In 1979, the newly elected municipal council of Montpellier decided to undertake urban development and develop a new district on a site near the city centre. The purpose of this town-planning operation was to develop a new district along a central axis which would provide for the city's balanced eastward expansion and link the historical centre to the river Lez. The architect Ricardo Bofill created the master plan and most of the buildings in Antigone. From the design of the plazas to the details of the facades and exterior furniture and landscape elements, everything is proportionally and thematically related, creating a stylistic unity in a district full of boulevards and plazas, parks, major residential areas, shops, schools and sports, cultural and administrative facilities.
Antigone's projects designed by Bofill included:
Critical reception and commentary.
Prominent architectural historian Vincent Scully wrote of the project in 1988: "Using classical architecture to provide human scale and proportion, Antigone intends to breaks up the monotony of precast construction to generate a palace for the people. It is the classical language rethought and reconstituted in terms of the contemporary industrial technique of precast concrete construction, assembled piece by piece in a discrete order even more systematic than that sustained in the older, carved and hand-modelled way of classical building."
In an interview with architectural writer Carson Chan in 2014, Bofill said of Antigone: "I saw it as a model urban design project that could be a prototype for other places. I thought the French would take this project as a model for social housing and repeat it. I thought the world would take it as a model for housing developments. Then I realised that there could never be a model for a city or development. I think that kind of attitude toward development was my biggest mistake. There are no models for the future."
Transport.
Antigone is served by lines 1 and 4 of the Montpellier tramway. There are three stops: Antigone, Léon Blum and Place de l'Europe.

Peter Zoller

Peter Zoller (born 16 September 1952) is a theoretical physicist from Austria. He was professor at the University of Innsbruck and is known for his pioneering research on quantum computing, quantum simulation and quantum communication.
Biography.
Peter Zoller studied physics at the University of Innsbruck, where he received his doctorate in February 1977 with a thesis on the Stark effect and then worked as an assistant at the Department of Theoretical Physics. In 1978/79, he was a Max Kade Fellow with Peter Lambropoulos at the University of Southern California and in 1980 he stayed in the group of Dan Walls at the University of Waikato, New Zealand. In 1981, Zoller handed in his work "Über die lichtstatistische Abhängigkeit resonanter Multiphoton-Prozesse" at the University of Innsbruck to become lecturer (Venia docendi). In 1981/82 and 1988 he was Visiting Fellow at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA) at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and 1986 a visiting professor at the Université de Paris-Sud 11, Orsay. 
In 1991, Zoller became Professor at the Physics Department of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and JILA Fellow. At the end of 1994, he accepted a chair at the University of Innsbruck, where he worked until 2024. From 1995 to 1999, he headed the Department of Theoretical Physics, from 2001 to 2004, he was vice-dean of studies. From 2003 to 2024, he was a Scientific Director at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. 
Zoller remained closely associated with JILA as an Adjoint Fellow. Numerous guest professorships have taken him to major centers of physics. Among others, he was Loeb Lecturer at Harvard University (2004) Yan Jici Chair Professor at the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Chair Professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing (2004), Lorentz Professor at the University of Leiden, Netherlands (2005) and Distinguished Lecturer at the Technion in Haifa (2007). He was Moore Distinguished Scholar at Caltech (2008/2010), Arnold Sommerfeld Lecturer at LMU München (2010), Distinguished Fellow at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching (2012) and Solvay Professor of Physics at the University of Brussels (2015). In 2014, he became "External Scientific Member" at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics.
In 2018, Peter Zoller co-founded Alpine Quantum Technologies, a quantum computing hardware company.
Research.
As a theoretical physicist, Zoller has made significant contributions to atomic physics, many-body physics and quantum information science. In particular, his proposals on quantum computing with trapped ions, on quantum simulation with ultracold atoms in optical lattices and on quantum repeaters in quantum communication have made a decisive contribution to bringing theoretical concepts of quantum information into a laboratory setting. This has inspired and guided new experimental research directions and established quantum optical systems as one of the leading experimental platforms for quantum technologies.
In 1995, together with Ignacio Cirac, he proposed a “quantum computer with cold trapped ions”. This was the first experimentally realistic and comprehensive proposal for a universal quantum computer. This work triggered a rapid experimental development in which numerous pioneering achievements such as the demonstration of quantum algorithms, digital quantum simulations, quantum error correction and quantum metrology were achieved. In 1999, Cirac and Zoller proposed a quantum computer based on cold atoms in optical lattices, in which two-qubit gates are executed by controlled collisions. A year later, together with Mikhail Lukin and others, they presented an alternative way to implement these gates using Rydberg atoms. With the ever-improving experimental control of neutral atoms in laser tweezers, this approach is becoming increasingly important.
In 1998, Cirac and Zoller proposed the use of ultracold atoms in optical lattices as an analog quantum simulator for Hubbard models to investigate questions in solid-state physics. This approach allows strongly interacting many-body systems to be probed in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium states, addressing key questions in the theory and design of correlated quantum materials and in regimes challenging for classical calculations. The experimental development of this platform has led to a number of important advances, including the first observation of the transition between superfluidity and a Mott insulator, the creation and study of topological quantum phases of matter with synthetic gauge fields, and the exploration of the 2D fermionic Hubbard model.
Also in 1998, a team led by Zoller presented the concept of quantum repeaters, which overcame the problems associated with noise and the loss of photons in optical fibers and made quantum communication over long distances possible. Previously, they had discovered the possibility of entangling atoms by exchanging photons at a distance. In 2001, they proposed a specific atomic setup to build such quantum repeaters. These have become a crucial building block for the development and deployment of quantum communication.
Zoller's ideas and concepts attract widespread interest within the scientific community and his works are highly cited.
Awards.
Peter Zoller received honorary doctorates of the University of Amsterdam (2012), the University of Colorado Boulder (2019), and the University of Concepción (2024).
For his achievements in the field of quantum optics and quantum information and especially for his pioneering work on quantum computers, quantum simulation and quantum communication he als received numerous prizes, these include:
In 2001, Peter Zoller became full member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In 2008 he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, in 2009 to the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences, in 2010 to the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, in 2012 to the European Academy of Sciences, in 2013 to the Academia Europaea, in 2023 in the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, and in 2024 to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities.

In-Gall

In-Gall (var. In Gall, I-n-Gall, In-Gal, Ingal, Ingall) is a department, commune and town in the Agadez Region of northeast Niger, with a year-round population of less than 500. Known for its oasis and salt flats, In-Gall is the gathering point for the Cure Salee festival of Tuareg and Wodaabe pastoralists to celebrate the end of the rainy season each September. During the festival, In-Gall's population grows to several thousand nomads, officials, and tourists. As of 2011, the commune had a total population of 47,170 people.
In-Gall had been a stop on the main roads between the capital of Niger, Niamey (600 km to the southwest), and the mining town of Arlit (200 km to the northeast, 150 km from the Algerian border) or the provincial capital Agadez (100 km to the east). In the 1970s, the main road was repaved to transport uranium from the French-owned mines in Arlit, but the new road bypassed In-Gall, ending its use as a waystation. Since then, its population has dropped from almost 5,000 to less than 500.
During the Tuareg insurgency of the 1990s, In-Gall was a prime fortification of the Niger armed forces, and when peace was concluded in 2000 the old fort was reportedly abandoned.
Description.
"InGall, an oasis town in a semi-desert zone that forms the gateway to the Sahara. InGall is a conglomeration of mud houses, whose gardens, in contrast to the barren landscape in which the town is set, are filled with fruit trees and vegetable patches."
History.
The history, archaeology, and culture of the In-Gall area has been extensively studied, most notably by the French anthropologist and archaeologist couple, Suzanne and Edmond Bernus.
In-Gall is not only a prominent Tuareg seasonal centre, to which certain clans return each year, but it has a history as a stop in the Trans-Saharan trade, was an eastern outpost of the Songhay Empire in the 16th century, was an important centre of the Aïr Sultanate thereafter, and became a French colonial fort in an often hostile region in the early 20th century.
Pre-history.
Archaeological evidence shows the area as a centre of prehistoric populations dating back some eight thousand year to when it sat in the midst of a now dry Azawagh river valley, fed by the Aïr Massif and flowing south to the Niger River. Of particular note have been thousands of pre-common era stone burial mounds which suggest a common culture in the area. Archeologists have also found in the In-Gall region many of the earliest mosques in Niger, dating back to early Berber occupations before 1000CE.
Salt extraction.
In-Gall is intimately linked with the nearby salt industry at Tegguiada In Tessoum, around 15 km to the north. Teguidda, on the site of an ancient lake bed, floods as water washes down from the Aïr Massif to the east each year, producing natural salt ponds. The population of In-Gall maintain and harvest from evaporation ponds here, sending labourers from the local clans to work the salt and transport it back to In-Gall at the end of the season. In-Gall is near enough that, unlike the oasis town of Fachi where plots are owned by Agadez-based Tuareg clans and worked by a permanent population, the workers at Teguidda return to In-Gall for the remainder of the year. Teguidda also lacks a stable oasis, which provides In-Gall with market gardens and date palm farming on a year-round basis. Prior to its decline in the 20th century — because of the smaller scale of the In-Gall salt markets as well as its easy access by road — In-Gall was once a destination of the Azalai salt caravans, in which Tuareg merchants transported salt from the markets here across the Sahel for agricultural and medicinal uses.
Uranium mining.
In 2004, a Canadian corporation was granted a government license to mine for uranium in the area. Northwestern Mineral Ventures was awarded the Irhazer and Ingall concessions, each in size. Mines would reportedly be "open pit" strip mines. More than 100 uranium exploration licenses have been granted in the Azawagh area since 2004 to foreign firms from China (over 40%), Canada, and India. Since 2007, a Chinese mining consortium, whose license covers an area north of In-Gall, has carried out infrastructural work for new uranium mine at Azelik, some 85 km north of in Gall, which includes extending roads from In-Gall to the site. Nigerien human rights, environmental and Tuareg groups have argued that mining activities in this region are a threat to scarce water resources, upon which pastoralists depend. The short rainy season in the Azawagh area north and west of In-Gall makes the region the northern destination for a cattle and camel herding transhumance cycle, which sees communities travel as far south as Burkina Faso during the dry months.
Dinosaurs.
In-Gall is also famous to outsiders for its palaeontological digs, most notably the Jobaria tiguidensis, and the remains of petrified forests dating back 135 million years.

Theodore Loblaw

Theodore Pringle Loblaw (July 1, 1872 – April 2, 1933) was a Canadian grocer. Loblaw founded the Loblaws chain of grocery stores.
Biography.
Loblaw was born in Elmgrove, northeast of Alliston, the son of William John Loblaw and Isabella Stevenson Johnson. After his parents' deaths during his adolescence, Loblaw was raised by his maternal grandparents, William and Elizabeth Johnson, at their farm just outside Alliston. In the 1890s he headed to Toronto to begin his career in retail grocery. He later settled in Mimico and eventually purchased his grandparents' farm. He also sponsored the construction of Stevenson Memorial Hospital in Alliston to honour his grandparents. 
Loblaw married Isabella Adam in 1897. The Loblaws had no biological children and were survived by their grand niece (Jean Agnes Loblaw 1917-1993) and nephews (Alexander Burr-Loblaw (1904-1978), John Burr-Loblaw (1906-1972) and James Fraser Burr-Loblaw (1910-1986).
Loblaw died at Toronto Western Hospital on April 2, 1933 and buried at Alliston Union Cemetery in Alliston, Ontario.
Creating Loblaws Groceteria.
In 1919 Loblaw was hired by the United Farmers Cooperative Company (the purchasing agent of the United Farmers of Ontario co-operative) having previously co-managed a grocery store. He was involved in an unsuccessful attempt by the UFCC to launch a chain of cooperative grocery stores; he left the company and used the experience he had gained to found the grocery chain that bears his name, Loblaws.
Toronto Western Hospital.
Loblaw was also instrumental in the establishment of the Toronto Western Hospital, as well as of the Stevenson Memorial Hospital in Alliston, which was named in honour of his grandparents.

Gareth Davies (doctor)

Gareth Davies (born 10 March 1965) is a physician and consultant in emergency medicine and pre-hospital emergency medicine, working for the NHS at the Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel. He is best known for his role as lead doctor of the flight crew for the London Air Ambulance (HEMS) and has been seen many times on the BBC documentary television series "Trauma", "Trauma Uncut" and "An Hour to Save Your Life" He has also made an appearance as a mentor in an episode of the CBBC series "Hero Squad", and on Channel 5's "Trauma Doctors".
Early life and education.
Davies was born and grew up in Douglas on the Isle of Man, famous for its Isle of Man TT motorcycle racing event. As a child, Davies was interested in motor sport and saw the consequences when people were injured. He would follow ambulances to the scenes of accidents to see what care was provided, noting the advanced medical care required.
On "From the Top: Gareth Davies", an educational program broadcast on Channel 4, Davies recalled watching a television program from the United States at the age of 16: "It was about these firemen who delivered medical care as firemen, and they called themselves paramedics and that I thought was absolutely fantastic!" He formed a goal to become a paramedic. At that time paramedicine was in its infancy, so his options were either to join the fire service and try and do medicine, or pursue medical training. He chose the latter, hoping that one day he would be able to treat people at the roadside in a paramedic capacity.
After his A-levels, Davies completed five years of medical training at Sheffield Medical School.
7 July 2005 bombings.
On the day of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, Davies was mobilised by London Ambulance Service along with the rest of the London HEMS team. He was deployed at Aldgate, where he was the Medical Incident Officer, and later re-deployed to Kings Cross.
Management responsibilities.
In addition to his NHS duties, he serves as the Medical Director of London's Air Ambulance Ltd (Company No. 2337239) and as a director of a number of other companies including London Air Ambulance Trading Ltd (Company No. 04836606), UK HEMS Ltd (Company No. 06491323), EMSC Ltd (Company No. 07179442) and Medical Excellence Ltd (Company No. 05668741).

In 2012 he was nominated for an Olivier Award for his performance in the title role in the original West End run of "Shrek the Musical" at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane and won the Whatsonstage Award for Best Supporting Actor in the 2011 production of Arthur Miller's "Broken Glass" at the Tricycle Theatre.
Early life and education.
Lindsay was born in St John's Wood and grew up in North West London. He attended Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood, an independent private day school for boys before going on to the University of Birmingham, where he studied English and French. After university, he worked for three years as a financial analyst, specialising in French and Belgian equities at London stockbrokers Savory Milln and Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC). But he gave up the city and won a place at bar school and drama school starting on the same day. He opted for the two-year drama course at the Webber Douglas Academy, where he won the Amherst Webber Scholarship. His finals show, in which he appeared as the eponymous "Charley's Aunt", was directed by Michael Fry, who gave him his first professional job with the Lincolnshire touring company Great Eastern Stage.
Career.
Lindsay's early work was mainly in theatre. One of his first London stage roles saw him play the King of France in "King Lear" at the Royal Court Theatre, with Tom Wilkinson as Lear and Andy Serkis as the Fool. At a weekly Monday night poker game, Lindsay was asked by Patrick Marber to attend a week's improvisational workshop of a play he was devising about poker. This became "Dealer's Choice", which premiered at the National Theatre in February 1995 with Lindsay as Mugsy and Ray Winstone and Phil Daniels among the original cast. The play transferred to the Vaudeville Theatre, and won that year's Evening Standard Award for Best Comedy and Writers' Guild Award for Best Play. Other theatre work includes: Max in "The Real Thing" by Tom Stoppard, which won three Tonys on Broadway in 2000; Ariel in the 2004 Olivier award-winning National Theatre production of Martin McDonagh's "The Pillowman", with Jim Broadbent and David Tennant; twice as Nathan Detroit in Michael Grandage's "Guys and Dolls" at the Piccadilly Theatre in 2005 and again at the Phoenix Theatre in 2015, and Charlie Maggs in "Sucker Punch," with Daniel Kaluuya at the Royal Court in 2010. Lindsay has appeared in five plays at the Almeida Theatre, including as Lenny in Harold Pinter's "The Homecoming" with Ken Cranham and Danny Dyer in 2009 and as Moe Axelrod alongside Stockard Channing and Jodie Whittaker in "Awake and Sing" by Clifford Odets, for which he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in the 2008 Whatsonstage Awards.
Lindsay has appeared in many regular series, including: "Unforgotten", "Spooks", "Silent Witness", "Waking the Dead", "Poirot", "New Tricks" and "Inspector George Gently". He played Odo Stevens in the 1997 Channel 4 adaptation of "A Dance to the Music of Time"; Ewan McGregor's boss Ron Baker in the film "Rogue Trader"; the Jewish terrorist Levi in "Rome"; and Lt Col Mervyn Gonin in the BAFTA nominated "The Relief of Belsen". He has worked with Steve Coogan on "I'm Alan Partridge", "Mid-Morning Matters with Alan Partridge", and ""; with Armando Iannucci on "The Armando Iannucci Shows"; with Jennifer Saunders in two series of "Jam and Jerusalem"; and again with Chris Morris on "Brass Eye". More recently he appeared as Tony Walsh in two series of the BBC comedy "White Gold".
Later theatre work includes playing Bolingbroke opposite David Tennant in the RSC production of "Richard II" at Stratford and the Barbican; Jack McCracken in the National Theatre revival of the Alan Ayckbourn play "A Small Family Business" in the Olivier theatre; and Charlie Fox opposite Lindsay Lohan and Richard Schiff in David Mamet's "Speed-the-Plow" at the Playhouse Theatre in the West End. In 2021, Lindsay made his debut at Ireland's National Theatre, the Abbey Theatre, in Brian Friel's "Faith Healer" alongside Niamh Cusack and Aidan Gillen to great critical acclaim. In 2023 he appeared as Henry Lehman in a 17 week, sold out revival of "The Lehman Trilogy" at the Gillian Lynne Theatre in London's West End, directed by Sam Mendes.

Drymobius margaritiferus

Drymobius margaritiferus, commonly known as the speckled racer, is a species of nonvenomous colubrid snake native to the Americas. The specific name, "margaritiferus", means "pearl-bearing" in Latin, referring to the pearl-like spots on the dorsal scales.
Geographic range and habitat.
This species ranges throughout Central America from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and Yucatán Peninsula, southward to Panama and adjacent areas of northwest Colombia, occurring at elevations from sea level up to 4,750 feet (1,453 m). Northward, it is found in the coastal lowlands and lower exterior slopes of the Sierra Madres of Mexico, up the west coast to Sonora, and up the east coast to northern Tamaulipas. The northern limit of its distribution ranges into extreme south Texas, USA, where it is uncommon to rare in a few of the southernmost counties of the state.
Speckled racers occur in a wide variety of habitats, including: forest, forest edges and clearings, secondary growth, riparian zones, savannahs, marshlands, pastures, and roadsides. It is often said to favor humid and wet areas with permanent water sources. However, these snakes have been found in areas where no water was apparent, and habitats include tropical dry forests and tropical arid forests. In Costa Rica, it is described as "ubiquitous in "all but" the most humid lowland and pre-montane zones," including dry lowland forests.
Description.
The speckled racer is typically black in color, with distinctive yellow and blue spotting, and one light-colored spot on each scale, which gives the snake an overall greenish hue. The labials are yellow, with black sutures. The underside is typically yellow to green. They average 30–40 in. (76–102 cm) in length, with a record specimen documented at 50 in. (127 cm).
The dorsal scales, which are feebly keeled middorsally, but smooth on the flanks, are arranged in 17 rows. The ventrals number 142–168; the subcaudals, 85–126.
Natural history.
As the name "racer" implies, it is a fast and agile species that is predominantly diurnal. It has been described as a nervous species, and will not hesitate to bite in self-defense when restrained or handled. 
Death feigning behavior, or thanatosis, was reported for two out of seven (28.5%) specimens that were caught and handled during field surveys conducted in Tamaulipas, Mexico.
They will consume a wide variety of prey, but primarily feed on frogs and toads. One study of 36 Guatemalan and Mexican specimens with food items in their stomachs found 86% had anurans (predominantly "Eleutherodactylus"), 8% lizards, 4% reptile eggs, and 2% small mammals. Juveniles are known to eat insects.
They are oviparous, typically laying eggs in the spring, although in southern areas, the species is known to deposit eggs as early as February and March. Clutch sizes range from two to eight eggs that are usually 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in length. Incubation is typically eight to nine weeks, with hatchlings measuring 6 to 10½ inches (15.2–27.6 cm) long.
Subspecies.
There are four recognized subspecies of "D. margaritiferus":
Conservation status.
The speckled racer is a threatened species in the state of Texas, USA, where it is uncommon to rare. In some regions of Mexico and Central America, it is a common species.

Jim Stapleton

James Stapleton (1863 – 18 March 1949) was an Irish hurler who played as a forward for the Tipperary senior team.
Stapleton made his first appearance for the team during the inaugural championship and was a regular member of the team for just one season. During his brief inter-county career he won one All-Ireland medal. Stapleton captained the team to the All-Ireland title in 1887.
At club level Stapleton was a one-time county championship medalist with Thurles Sarsfield's.
Biography.
Jim Stapleton was born in Thurles, County Tipperary in 1863. He was born into an area that had a strong hurling tradition, and he grew up playing the game with his local team. On the field of play Stapleton was widely known for his strength and his stamina. Off the field he was regarded as a sincere gentleman.
Jim Stapleton died in 1949.
Playing career.
Club.
Stapleton played his club hurling with the famous Thurles Sarsfields club. In 1887 he won his only county championship title.
Inter-county.
As a result of this victory in the county championship, Thurles were given the honour of representing Tipperary in the inaugural All-Ireland Hurling Championship. They defeated Clare in the opening round before advancing to the final following a semi-final victory over Kilkenny. Fate played a large role in Stapleton having the mantle of captain bestowed on him for the inaugural All-Ireland final. Because of a dispute over the railway travelling expenses, seven players including the Thurles captain Dinny Maher were left standing on the platform of the morning of the match. Tipp's All-Ireland final meeting with Galway proved to be their toughest test yet. At a crucial stage in the second-half Stapleton led a charge down the field. Spotting a free player he passed the sliothar to Tom Healy who went on to score the very first goal in an All-Ireland final. Stapleton, on the other hand, had the honour of being the first person to captain a team to an All-Ireland Hurling Final victory.
In 1888 Stapleton was among 50 Irish athletes and hurlers who traveled to the United States to play in several hurling exhibition games. While many of the group stayed in America, Stapleton returned home where he continued his involvement with the infant Gaelic Athletic Association.

Larry Zeidel

Lazarus "Larry The Rock" Zeidel (June 1, 1928 – June 17, 2014) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman, most notably for the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League, for whom he played nine seasons, and in the National Hockey League for the Chicago Black Hawks and the Philadelphia Flyers during a career that lasted from 1947 to 1969. He is considered one of the most violent players in NHL history, and at the time of his retirement, was the most penalized player in minor league history.
Biography.
Zeidel was Jewish, and was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. His Romanian grandparents "had been cremated in a concentration camp".
Zeidel played for the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Black Hawks in the early 1950s, and concluded his career with the Philadelphia Flyers in the late 1960s. In between, he played for numerous teams in the Western Hockey League and the American Hockey League. Zeidel played most of his career for the Hershey Bears, a team later affiliated with the National Hockey League’s Washington Capitals but that was independent at the time, located in Hershey, Pennsylvania. In 1959–60, his 293 penalty minutes set an AHL league record.
Zeidel won the Stanley Cup in 1952 with the Detroit Red Wings. He won the Calder Cup in 1964 with the Cleveland Barons.
Zeidel promoted himself to all 1967 expansion franchises using a self-made promotion kit and resume, subsequently drawing the interest of the Philadelphia Flyers, who signed him to a contract at age 39. While playing for the Philadelphia Flyers, he was involved in a violent stick-swinging duel with Boston's Eddie Shack, which left both men bleeding. Both players were suspended for the incident, Zeidel receiving a four-game suspension and three games for Shack. Boston Bruins players yelled at him with anti-Semitic comments throughout the season after the incident.
After he retired from hockey, Zeidel worked as a marketing consultant for an investment house.
Zeidel died on June 17, 2014, at 86 years of age of complications from congestive heart failure, kidney problems, and dementia. He was diagnosed after death by Boston University researchers who were studying brains of deceased hockey players. A panel of neurologists, neuropsychologists, and researchers reached the clinical consensus diagnoses that he suffered from Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease found in people who have had multiple head injuries. The report concluded that he had likely had more than 100 concussions, and lost consciousness over 10 times. By the time he had retired, he had suffered debilitating headaches, acute temper, odd behavior, and had made uncharacteristically rash financial decisions.

Spiritual transformation

Spiritual transformation involves a fundamental change in a person's sacred or spiritual life.
Psychologists examine spiritual transformation within the context of an individual's "meaning system", especially in relation to concepts of the sacred or of ultimate concern. Two of the fuller treatments of the concept in psychology come from Kenneth Pargament and from Raymond Paloutzian.
Pargament holds that "at its heart, spiritual transformation refers to a fundamental change in the place of the sacred or the character of the sacred in the life of the individual. Spiritual transformation can be understood in terms of new configurations of strivings" (p. 18).
Paloutzian suggests that "spiritual transformation constitutes a change in the meaning system that a person holds as a basis for self-definition, the interpretation of life, and overarching purposes and ultimate concerns" (p. 334).
One school of thought emphasises the importance of "rigorous self-discipline" in spiritual transformation.
Research.
The Metanexus Institute (founded 1997) in New York has sponsored scientific research on spiritual transformation.
Terminology.
Occurrences of the phrase "spiritual transformation" in Google Books suggest a surge in the popularity of the concept from the late-20th century.

The Nifty Nineties

The Nifty Nineties is an animated short film produced in Technicolor by Walt Disney Productions and released to theaters on June 20, 1941, by RKO Radio Pictures. The animated short was directed by Riley Thomson and animated by Ward Kimball, Walt Kelly, Fred Moore, Claude Smith, David Swift, and Les Clark with effects animation by Art Fitzpatrick. It was the 113th short in the "Mickey Mouse" film series to be released, and the fourth in that year. The film stars Mickey and Minnie Mouse and romanticizes the decade of the 1890s.
The film features original and adapted music by Charles Wolcott. The voice cast includes Walt Disney as Mickey and Marcellite Garner as Minnie. Animators Ward Kimball and Fred Moore have cameos where they each voice a caricatured version of themselves.
Plot.
Set in the springtime, sometime in the 1890s, Mickey and Minnie Mouse happen to meet each other in a public park one day. Minnie attracts Mickey by intentionally dropping her handkerchief so that Mickey will return it to her.
They attend a vaudeville show where they first see a slideshow presentation called "Father, Dear, Father", which features the song "Come Home, Father" by Henry Clay Work. In the show, a daughter attempts to get her father to leave a local tavern because he had not come right home from work as promised and got drunk at the tavern. In the fourth picture in the slideshow, we see the clock tower, which reads 1:00 am. With the mother home watching since tea and her son very sick in her arms, there can only be hope that the father comes home, but the father is too drunk to listen to the daughter, eventually forcing her to bring her father home herself. The slideshow causes Minnie to cry, but Mickey tries to comfort her, saying, "Don't take it so hard. It's only a show". The final slide shows a postcard with the words P.S. "He came home!", indicating that the father and daughter had made it back home.
The next act is "Fred &amp; Ward, Two Clever Boys From Illinois" which features two song and dance men. Fred and Ward are caricatures of Disney animators Fred Moore and Ward Kimball, who also voiced the characters.
After the show is over, Mickey and Minnie cruise the roads of the countryside in a Brass Era car. Goofy rides by on a penny-farthing bicycle (which topples over), and Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Huey, Dewey and Louie ride on a bicycle built for five. At last, in a scene reminiscent of "Plane Crazy", the car crashes with a cow. Mickey and Minnie emerge from the wreckage unhurt, but when they try to kiss each other, the cow pops her head up between them.
Songs.
Except one song, "The Gay Nineties" (the opening song), this short featured mostly authentic songs which would have been familiar around this era, most of which were performed by the vocal quartet The Sportsmen, which featured Thurl Ravenscroft in one of his earliest projects for Disney.
The songs include:
Notes.
Part of the dance sequence with Fred and Ward was reused in a scene in "Jiminy Cricket's You and Your Senses of Taste and Smell".
Home media.
The short was released on May 18, 2004, on "". and on the DVD of Walt Disney's Pollyanna.

SG Flensburg-Handewitt

SG Flensburg-Handewitt is a professional handball club from Flensburg and Handewitt in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Currently, they compete in the Handball-Bundesliga and EHF European League. They play home matches at Flens-Arena. Since forming in 1990, the club has been one of Germany's most successful teams domestically and in European tournaments. The club is best known for winning the EHF Champions League in 2014 by defeating arch-rivals THW Kiel in the final 30–28.
History.
SG Flensburg-Handewitt was created in 1990 following a merger of the handball divisions of TSB Flensburg and Handewitter SV. The first season of the club (1990–1991) took place in the 2. Handball-Bundesliga, with SG finishing in fourth position under Zvonimir Serdarušić. In 1992, they were promoted to the top division as SG Flensburg-Handewitt for the first time, winning every league fixture. In their first season in the top-flight, SG finished sixteenth, though they were spared relegation due to the liquidation of TSV Milbertshofen. The following year, under the leadership of Anders Dahl-Nielsen, SG were fourth and from that point, equalled that placement or better in each season until the 2008/09 season.
SG Flensburg-Handewitt acquired their first major trophy with the 1996/1997 EHF Cup by defeating Danish side Virum-Sorgenfri HK 52–42 on aggregate in the final. Three consecutive DHB-Pokal titles (2003/04 vs TUSEM Essen, 2004/05 vs HSV Hamburg, and 2005/06 vs THW Kiel) followed, as did success in the league, with a championship victory in the 2003/04 season. Flensburg defeated HSG Nordhorn-Lingen at Flens-Arena in round 33 to secure their very first title with a game to spare. Slovenian club RK Celje did however, prevent a third trophy that year for SG by winning the 2003-04 EHF Champions League final against them. The 2004-05 and 2005-06 league campaigns both saw Flensburg finish second behind THW Kiel. In 2007, SG once again lost the Champions League final, this time they were defeated by "Landesderby" rivals THW Kiel.
In 2010, former player Ljubomir Vranjes became the new coach and it was under him that SG Flensburg-Handewitt won the EHF Champions League final at their third attempt, beating THW Kiel 30–28 at the Lanxess Arena in Cologne. During Vranjes' time as coach of SG, they also won the DHB-Pokal for a fourth time, beating SC Magdeburg on penalties. Maik Machulla took over from Vranjes as head coach in 2017, and consecutive league titles (their second and third successes) followed in the 2017/18 and 2018/2019 campaigns. The 2017/18 title was secured on the final day of the season with a 22–21 victory over Frisch Auf Göppingen. The following year, SG once again took the title on the final day, winning 27–24 away at Bergischer HC. Machulla was sacked in April 2023 after Flensburg lost three vital matches in just eight days. They were defeated 38–31 by Rhein-Neckar Löwen in the DHB-Pokal semi-finals, 35–27 at Flens-Arena by BM Granollers in the EHF European League quarter-finals, and then 29–19 by THW Kiel in the Nordderby in a crucial Handball-Bundesliga game. In the 2023-24 season with Nicolej Krickau as head coach, Flensburg missed out on qualification for the 2024-25 EHF Champions League by finishing 3rd in the Handball-Bundesliga. They were also defeated in the semi-finals of the DHB-Pokal by MT Melsungen, though they were victorious in the 2023-24 EHF European League final, defeating Füchse Berlin.
SG Flensburg-Handewitt holds a reputation as being a perennial "second-place" club – with three league titles the team has also finished runner-up fourteen times. In addition to this, they reached each of the seven DHB-Pokal finals between 2011 and 2017, losing six of them. The club has however, won all the competitions it has participated in at least once except the IHF Super Globe, and it is the only club to have won four different European Cups (one EHF Champions League, two EHF Cup Winners' Cup, two EHF European League titles and one EHF European Cup in addition to several finals), as well as the three different German national competitions (three German championships, four DHB-Pokal and three DHB-Supercup).
Due to their proximity to Scandinavia, SG typically have top international players from Denmark, Sweden and Norway in their squad. Danish right winger Lasse Svan became the club's all-time leading appearance maker during the 2021/22 season, overtaking legendary left winger and fellow Dane Lars Christiansen. At the most recent World Men's Handball Championship, the victorious Danish squad featured six Flensburg players.

East Hunsbury

East Hunsbury is a large residential area in the south of Northampton, England, situated around from the town centre and from junction 15 of the M1 motorway. For administrative purposes it is part of the unitary authority of West Northamptonshire. It is part of the Hunsbury conglomeration, which also includes West Hunsbury on the west side of Towcester Road. Shelfleys is the original name for the area of Northampton currently referred to as West Hunsbury. The name of West Hunsbury still appears on maps for the district as Shelfleys. Merefield is the corresponding name for East Hunsbury, together with the name "Blacky More" for the eastern part of East Hunsbury. All three names are still on local direction signs in Northampton, although older references are no longer in use by the local people living there. The areas developed in the 1980s and 1990s as part of the expansion of Northampton. The Northampton loop of the West Coast Main Line railway running between Northampton and London Euston runs under East and West Hunsbury via the Hunsbury Hill Tunnel emerging near Hill Farm Rise which follows the original course of Towcester Road prior to the 1980s. Ventilation shafts are visible in the housing estate in Yeoman Meadow. East Hunsbury was awarded ‘Best Large Village’ in 2019 by NorthantsAcre. 
Industry before Housing Development.
Until the 1890s the East Hunsbury was agricultural land. From 1897 an iron ore quarry to the west expanded into the area south and east of Hunsbury and from 1912 to the area on each side of the cutting at the south end of the railway tunnel.and on the east side of the original course of Towcester Road. The ore was taken to the Hunsbury Ironworks which was by the River Nene south of Duston for smelting. The ore was taken by a 3 ft 8 inch gauge tramway which was horse worked until 1912 when steam locomotives were introduced. Quarrying ceased in 1921. Little was done to landscape the area and the quarries were clearly visible in 1966. There were proposals to begin quarrying again in the 1920s, in 1937 and again in 1952 but nothing came of these. Much of the quarried area has been built on.
Demographics.
The 2001 census shows a population of 9,058 of which 4,561 were male and 4,497 female, in 3,616 households.
Community.
There are two smaller retail parks, one at Blacky More with a small supermarket, takeaway fish and chip shop, florists, chemist, hair salon, a public house ("The Collingtree"), community centre and an estate agent. At the other in Merefield, adjacent to the Mereway ring road, there is a larger supermarket open 24 hours, except Sunday, 10:00 to 16:00. It has a coffee shop, optician and a petrol station. Also on the same site is a sandwich shop, estate agent , a restaurant, a card shop and a hair dressers. There is also the Danes Camp Leisure centre and swimming pool
. Collingtree Park Golf Course is in Windingbrooke Lane and accessible from Rowtree Road.
East Hunsbury is also home to the Grangewood Park Residents Club, a leisure complex converted from grade II listed farm buildings for the exclusive use of 265 homeowners on the Grangewood Estate (located within 'Merefield' – see above) and their invited guests. The leisure complex includes two licensed bar areas, tennis &amp; squash courts.
Schools.
There are two primary schools in the area: East Hunsbury Primary School and Simon de Senlis Primary School, which was rebuilt in 2006-8, having previously been a Lower School. The re-build was part of the Northampton PFI, the government's Private Funding Initiative, with the partner companies involved being Babcock &amp; Brown Properties, Amey and Galliford Try.
The area is in the catchment of Abbeyfield School, formerly Mereway Upper School and later Community College, located on the north side of Mere Way dual carriageway. It is also the catchment for Wootton Park School which is a newly built primary and secondary school located on the south side of the Mereway dual carriageway. Many children of secondary age in the district go to Campion School in Bugbrooke or Caroline Chisholm School in Wootton, Northamptonshire.
Governance.
The area now has its own Parish Council. Until 2015 it was part of Wooton parish. East Hunsbury Parish Council was formed on 1 April 2015. This was part of a Community Governance Review.
Following local government changes in 2021 the area is governed by West Northamptonshire council.
Prior to that the area was part of East Hunsbury Ward of Northampton Borough Council, electing two members, both Conservative. However, note that the area of Collingtree Park and Collingtree village, although adjacent to East Hunsbury were in the Nene Valley ward for both county and borough elections.
The area was part of East Hunsbury divisions of Northamptonshire County Council, electing one member, a Conservative. The area of Collingtree Park and Collingtree village, although adjacent to East Hunsbury, was in the Nene Valley ward.
New developments.
A major urban extension of 2,000 houses, of which "ca."35% would be affordable housing was proposed by Bovis Homes in July 2008 at Collingtree Park with all access from Windingbrook Lane, off Rowtree Road. In January 2015 the proposed 1,000 homes were rejected by local residents and borough councillors.

Evolution (TV series)

Evolution is a 2001 documentary series by the American broadcaster Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and WGBH on evolutionary biology, from the producers of "NOVA".
Overview.
The spokespeople for the series were Jane Goodall (overall spokesperson), Kenneth R. Miller and Stephen Jay Gould (science spokespeople), Eugenie C. Scott (education spokesperson), Arthur Peacocke and Arnold Thomas (religious spokespeople). The series was narrated by the Irish actor Liam Neeson.
The series was accompanied by a book by the popular science writer Carl Zimmer "Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea". An extensive website provides teaching resources for each episode's material, including "The Mating Game", further looks at Charles Darwin, and an interactive history of speciation in the invented "pollencreeper" birds.
The episode "What about God?" features discussion of the issues of evolution and creationism at Wheaton College, an Evangelical Protestant college that teaches evolution but has in the past restricted professors from taking a stance on the literal versus the allegorical interpretations of Adam and Eve in the Genesis account of creation.
Reception.
TV critic Julie Salamon, writing in "The New York Times", said that "[a] powerful sense of drama, discovery and intellectual enthusiasm runs through this rich eight-hour series ... The series covers an enormous amount of ground but doesn't leave you feeling swamped."
Being made and broadcast in the country where creation–evolution controversy is strongest, the last episode "What About God?" focused on religion, and "through personal stories of students and teachers, it offers the view that they are compatible". Phina Borgeson, Faith Network Director of the National Center for Science Education, provided a Congregational Study Guide for Evolution. Conversely, the Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture produced a website to refute the documentary and started a petition it called A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism to show that there were "scientists that dispute the claims".

<doc id="6947278" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6947278" title="Industrial Exposition Building">
Industrial Exposition Building

The Industrial Exposition Building was located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The building stood from 1886 to 1940 and was briefly the tallest structure in Minneapolis. In addition to smaller local exhibitions, it was the site of the 1892 Republican National Convention, the only major party convention to be held in Minnesota until the 2008 Republican National Convention.
The idea for an exposition in Minneapolis arose in 1885, when it became known that St. Paul had secured the permanent home of the Minnesota State Fair. Prominent citizens of Minneapolis such as Minneapolis Tribune owner Alden Blethen felt slighted, and an open meeting was called to gauge public support for an annual Minneapolis industrial fair, or exposition, to rival St. Paul's agricultural one. Supporters raised funds throughout the fall of 1885 and reached their goal of $250,000 on December 15.
The structure was built on the site of the Winslow House Hotel (today the area bounded by Bank Street SE, Central Avenue SE, Main Street SE, and Ortman Street SE). Designed by Isaac Hodgson, the building had eight stories. Its modified Renaissance exterior was dominated by a 240-foot corner tower. The exterior walls were masonry and the interior had metal support structures. The building's capacity was estimated at between 11,000 and 15,000.
The entire building was completed in just over three months: the cornerstone was laid on April 29, 1886, and the building was finished on August 3. On August 23 there was a grand celebration for the opening of the new building and its first exposition. 50,000 people were estimated to have attended and much of downtown was turned over to the celebration. Local dignitaries such as Senator Cushman K. Davis and Archbishop John Ireland spoke at the dedication. US President Grover Cleveland and his wife Frances could not attend. However, they sent a congratulatory telegram that was read publicly, and then in a dramatic moment, Mrs. Cleveland touched a special button in her New York location that started all of the machinery in the building.
The initial 40-day exposition was very successful, attracting nearly 500,000 visitors. The latest technology and industrial developments were on display, along with a collection of art and sculpture estimated at $500,000 in value. But in the following years, excitement lessened and the exposition began to lose money. Minneapolis could not have attracted the Republican National Convention of 1892 without the Industrial Exposition Building, but the convention was not enough to halt the exposition's decline. By 1893, exhibitors had evaporated and the fair had fallen apart.
In 1896, Thomas B. Janney bought the building at public auction for $25,000, a fraction of what it cost to build. For the next seven years, the space was used sporadically as a performance venue. It hosted the first concerts of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra which later became the Minnesota Orchestra and welcomed famous musicians and performers including Johann Strauss and New York's Metropolitan Opera. In 1903, Marion Savage, owner of race horse Dan Patch, bought the building and turned it into the International Stock Food Company.
By the 1930s, it was used as a merchandise warehouse for the M.W. Savage Co. mail order company. The structure was finally torn down in 1940 for the construction of a Coca-Cola bottling plant. The bottling plant was torn down in the 1980s and the site has since been redeveloped into condominiums.

Yau Kung Moon

Yau Kung Mun (also Yau Kung Moon) 柔功門 is a Shaolin martial art.
The Chinese term, 柔功門, can be roughly translated as "the style of flexible power". The Hong Kong and US schools usually use the romanization "Yau Kung Moon" or "Yau Kung Mon", whereas the Australian schools use the romanization "Yau Kung Mun".
Origins.
Yau Kung Mun martial arts were introduced to the public in 1924. Prior to that time, the history extends back into the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907 A.D.) in the Sil Lum Temple of Hunan province. The style was originated by a Buddhist monk named Ding Yang, who being very humble and withdrawn, gave no name to the style. The secrets of the style were selectively passed on to one disciple per generation within the confines of the Temple for hundreds of years into the Ching Dynasty (1644 - 1911 A.D.). When the Manchu conquered China to begin the Qing Dynasty, the officials and sympathizers of the former Ming emperor took refuge in the temples. To prevent attempts to restore the Ming to power, the Manchu emperor ordered the destruction of the temples. Many monks were killed, the rest fled; some to die of starvation. One surviving monk was Doe Sung. Doe Sung was the principal disciple of Yau Kung Mun, and had been the chosen representative of the Temple to meet all challengers. Through Doe Sung, the style survived continuing to pass to only one disciple per generation. (See diagram). It was through the priest Teat Yun that the style was given its name, and was presented to the public by accepting as his disciple the first lay person in Yau Kung Mun history, Grandmaster Ha Hon Hung. ["Yau Kung Mun Kung Fu, an Overview" by Wan Tak Kei and Dennis Lew]
Grandmaster HA Han Hong was a native of Ko Ming County, Kwangtung Province, China. He received a good family education and became a distinguished leader due to his comprehension of martial arts. As a young boy, he met Teat Yun who was traveling throughout southern China. Grandmaster HA was accepted as a student after rigorous testing to assess his character. Testing continued throughout his early training until he became a disciple. He learned the secrets of the style and Chinese orthopedics. Upon completing his training, Grandmaster HA was given the task to spread Yau Kung Moon and use his knowledge and skills to help humanity as his master returned to Sil Lum Temple.
In 1924, Grandmaster HA set up his first school in Kwangtung, China. Due to his Chinese medicine skills, Grandmaster HA became very famous. In 1936, he was an instructor and physician for the Command of the Military Police team which won the Kwangtung Provincial Martial Arts Championships. During War II, Grandmaster HA set up ambulance teams for Canton under guidance of the Red Cross for the League of Nations.
He continued to enrich his skills until the Communists took over China in 1949. He relocated and established a second school in Hong Kong. Due to his humbleness and contributions of public service, Grandmaster HA was highly regarded in the martial arts circle. With Grandmaster HA passing away in 1965, the administration of training was left to his only disciple, his son, HA Kwok Cheung Sijo. At present, there are about fifteen schools in Hong Kong organized as the Hong Kong Yau Kung Moon Sports Association.
Ha Hon Hung opened up the first Yau Kung Mun Academy at the Pearl River Martial Arts Club in Guangzhou (Canton) and formed the Ha Hon Hung Sports Association. Yau Kung Mun primarily gained popularity in the Cantonese-speaking region of China, but remains somewhat uncommon outside of the region. It is taught in several countries but is most active in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, the US and Australia. http://www.oocities.org/yaukungmoonla/History.html
Stylistic distinctions.
The Yau Kung Mun System is representative of southern styles in being based on a low, stable horse stance. It employs many upper body techniques and most kicks are kept low. The YKM stance (Chien Gung Ma) resembles the familiar "ding gee ma" or Kung-Fu side horse but back arch is more pronounced and the shoulders are thrown forward with arms and hands protecting the chest and groin area. Defense is natural since the critical areas of the body are behind the protective wall of the shoulders and arms. Kicks or punches delivered within range of the practitioner would still be out of range of vital areas. This same stance also lends itself readily to offense as the arms are already in the attack position and the back leg has the distance of leverage required for powerful kicking.
Yau Kung Mun has both an external and internal training. However, like most other styles of Kung-Fu renowned for their internal power, the individual system's manifestation of internal power is still somewhat secretive. The majority of early forms are primarily external while the most advanced forms evolve into primarily internal. The external training consists of 13 fist and 28 weapon sets. Besides the 18 classical weapons (see the Eighteen Arms of Wushu), weapon sets using common farm implements (the hoe, long chair, spade, etc.) are also part of the system.
Forms of YAU KUNG MOON
NOTE: Forms in Bold were incorporated from Pak Mei Kuen
Yau Kung Mun organizations.
Yau Kung Mun schools now exist in several countries. The main schools can be found in Hong Kong, Australia, United States, South America, Canada and Finland.
Hong Kong.
The original organization started by Ha Hon Hung is operating in Hong Kong, China.
United States.
During the 1960s, two of Grandmaster Ha Kwok Cheung's top disciples, Wong Cheung and Wan Tak Kei, immigrated to the United States from Hong Kong. Both Wong and Wan continued their training and teaching of the art - with Master Wong establishing a club in San Francisco and Master Wan creating a group in Los Angeles.
Since that time, both masters has taught thousands of students. Some of the oldest students from Wong and Wan include: Bill Lee, Loi Lok Fu, Lok Sang Lee, Michael Lau, David Louie, Kevin Quock, Dennis Lew and Bob Gin. In 2000, Sifu Lok Sang Lee promoted two of his students, Susan Yee and Richard Ow, to the rank of Sifu so that they can continue to teach this traditional style.
Australia.
In the 1970s, Yau Kung Mun Australia was established by Leung Cheung (), a top disciple of Ha Hon Hung (夏漢雄). This association was one of the first Chinese martial arts associations to publicly perform Southern and Northern style Lion Dances in Australia.
Yau Kung Mun Australia is now led by Sifu James Leung (梁鉅), Percy To (杜偉明) and Sifu Garry Hearfield.
Canada.
The Canadian branch of Yau Kung Moon was established by Master Wan in 2006. Naming two Sifu's Ryan S. and Ranie L. in Winnipeg, MB, Canada to carry on the tradition.
Finland.
The Finland branch of Yau Kung Moon was run by Master To. His Sifu is Great Grand Master Ha Hon Hung's disciple in Guangzhou.

Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary

Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, also referred to as Louisville Seminary, is a seminary affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA) and located in Louisville, Kentucky. It is one of 12 PC(USA) seminaries and it identifies as an ecumenical seminary, with recent student enrollment representing many faith traditions.
Though now located in Louisville, it was founded in 1853 in Danville, Kentucky (the site is now Centre College) and was known as the Danville Theological Seminary. Though it thrived in its early years, the Civil War took a great toll and by 1870 there were only six students enrolled, and as few as one professor at times, requiring classes to be taught by the faculty of Centre College.
The seminary is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE), and the Association of Theological Schools. The seminary is located on land adjacent to the Cherokee-Seneca Parks.
History.
In 1893, a seminary opened in Louisville, operating out of Sunday School rooms in Second Presbyterian Church at Second and Broadway, with 31 students and six professors initially, and an endowment of $104,000. Longtime treasurer W.T. Grant died in 1901 and left his entire $300,000 estate to the seminary, which helped finance the construction of a new Gothic-style Campus.
Daniel S. Bentley had studied at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Danville.
In 1901, the still-struggling Danville seminary merged with the Louisville one. Because of the merger, it was the only institution supported simultaneously by the northern and southern branches of the modern Presbyterian Church (USA). Faculty and students have been drawn from both denominations. The two branches, which split during the Civil War, were reunited in 1983.
In the 1950s, Interstate 65 was planned to be constructed within a few feet of the seminary building. This led to a move in 1963 to a new campus off of Alta Vista Road, in the Cherokee-Seneca neighborhood. The old Gothic-style buildings eventually became the campus of Jefferson Community College, which is now a part of Jefferson Community and Technical College. The seminary eventually acquired the Gardencourt Mansion, and integrated it into the adjacent campus.
Dean K. Thompson was named eighth president of Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary on April 22, 2004, and began his term in June 2004.
Dean served the seminary until his retirement in 2010.
Michael Jinkins served as the ninth president of Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary from September 1, 2010, until his retirement on September 2, 2018. Jinkins' leadership was marked by a commitment to expanding the seminary's educational offerings and strengthening its financial position. Under Jinkins' administration, Louisville Seminary saw the introduction of several initiatives, most notably the Doors to Dialogue interfaith relations program and the Black Church Studies program. These programs were designed to enrich the curriculum and engage students in critical conversations on religion, culture, and society.
The most notable achievement during Jinkins’ presidency was the launch of the Covenant for the Future capital campaign in 2011. This campaign aimed to ensure the long-term financial health of the seminary and featured the creation of the Covenant Scholarship program, which was established in 2015.
Alton B. Pollard, III is an American theologian and educator, best known for his service as the 10th president of Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary. Pollard began his presidency on September 3, 2018, and announced his intention to retire in 2023.
On September 6, 2024, Andrew Pomerville was inaugurated as the 11th president and a professor of Practical Theology at Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary (LPTS) in a ceremony at Caldwell Chapel. Pomerville began his tenure on July 1, 2023, and was formally confirmed by the 226th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) (PCUSA) in 2024.

Saint Genet

Saint Genet, Actor and Martyr () is a book by the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre about the writer Jean Genet, especially on his "The Thief's Journal". It was first published in 1952. Sartre described it as an attempt "to prove that genius is not a gift but the way out that one invents in desperate cases." Sartre also based his character Goetz in his play "The Devil and the Good Lord" (1951) on his analysis of Genet's psychology and morality. Sartre has been credited by David M. Halperin with providing, "a brilliant, subtle, and thoroughgoing study of the unique subjectivity and gender positioning of gay men".

Doug Favell

Douglas Robert Favell (born April 5, 1945) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender and former box lacrosse player. Favell played in the National Hockey League for the Philadelphia Flyers, Toronto Maple Leafs and Colorado Rockies.
Playing career.
Favell, along with future Flyers' teammate Bernie Parent, played his junior hockey for the Niagara Falls Flyers in the OHA. After the club won the Memorial Cup in 1965, both goalies began their professional careers in the Boston Bruins organization, who held their rights. Over the next two seasons, Favell played in the Bruins' farm system.
Favell, like Chicago Black Hawks goaltender Tony Esposito, was one of the few goaltenders then to employ the now-popular butterfly style, often going down to the ice to block shots in an era where the stand-up style of play dominated.
With the arrival of the six new expansion clubs for the 1967–68 NHL season, Favell and Parent were selected by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1967 NHL Expansion Draft. The goalies split the work that first season and led the Flyers to a first-place finish in the NHL's Western Division. Favell had a stellar 2.27 GAA with four shutouts. Both goalies toiled for the Flyers until Parent was dealt to the Toronto Maple Leafs in February 1971. 
Without Parent, Favell became the Flyers' workhorse goalie. He recorded seasons of 44, 54 and 44 games with GAAs of 2.66, 2.81 and 2.83 on an improving Flyers team. In 1973, the Flyers reached the league semifinals and Favell was one of the top players, appearing in 11 playoff games and recording a 2.60 GAA and one shutout.
Before the next season, Favell was traded to the Maple Leafs for none other than Bernie Parent. The Leafs had three veteran goalies but Favell played the most games in the regular season and playoffs. He recorded a strong win–loss record with a solid 2.71 GAA in 32 games. The following season saw the Leafs rely on two goalies, but Favell struggled in 39 games with the poorest goals against (4.05) of his career. His third season with the team was his last with only three games played and extended time on the injury list.
Favell's NHL rights were sold to the Colorado Rockies for the 1976–77 NHL season. After appearing in 30 games that season, Favell became the Rockies top goalie the following year, appearing in 47 contests. The 1978-79 campaign, however, would be his last in the NHL; battling injuries, Favell appeared in only seven games with the Rockies, with a dismal 0-5-2 record and a 5.38 GAA. He wound up playing most of the season in Philadelphia, with the Firebirds of the American Hockey League. 
Colorado exposed him to the 1979 NHL Expansion Draft. Selected by the Edmonton Oilers, he opted to retire instead of start fresh with a new franchise. Favell holds the distinction of being the only player selected in both the 1967 and 1979 NHL Expansion Drafts. Favell was known for an abruptly curved blocker pad on his stick hand. While Bruins goaltender Gerry Cheevers, Favell's goaltending partner for the Oklahoma City Blazers, was the first goaltender to have artwork on his mask, Favell was the first to use a painted design, just before Halloween 1970.
Lacrosse.
Favell also played lacrosse professionally for the Detroit Olympics of the National Lacrosse Association in 1968 and the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League in 1974. Favell was inducted into the Ontario Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 2005.

Manna (album)

Manna is the third studio album by American soft rock band Bread, released in 1971 on Elektra Records. 
The album peaked at No. 21 on the US Billboard 200. Manna has also been certified Gold in the US by the RIAA.
Critical reception.
Lester Bangs of Rolling Stone declared, "The new one offers no surprises. One nice thing about Bread is that they're totally professional, and as Mellow as most of the music is these days, they never cop out to sheer sloppiness...They've got standards and they sing with feeling, and maybe that's enough right now."
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave a 4.5/5 stars rating saying, "Bread's third album, Manna, isn't so much a step forward as it is a consolidation of strengths, as the group sharpens their skills and carves out their own identities...it results in a fine listen, especially since the group's songwriting remains at the high standard instituted on that first Bread album."
Singles.
The singles "Let Your Love Go" and "If" were released from this album. "Record World" said "Let Your Love Go" has a "heavier sound than usual from [the] group." "Cash Box" said that it "brings a new strength to the act's vocal sound, rumpling a bit of the letter-perfect smoothness of their first two hits."

Alfred Henry Spink

Alfred Henry Spink (August 24, 1854 – May 27, 1928) was a Canadian-born American baseball writer and club organizer based mainly in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1886, he established a weekly newspaper, "The Sporting News" (TSN), that emerged from World War I as the only national baseball newspaper or magazine.
Biography.
Born in the city of Quebec, Canada, Al Spink and his two brothers learned baseball's English cousin, cricket. The family of ten moved to Chicago after the American Civil War and the boys moved to baseball, whose boom was continental in scope. In 1869 or 1870, the Spinks founded the amateur Mutual club on the West Side, named after the professional Mutuals of New York. Probably there were dozens of amateur clubs in Chicago beside the professional White Stockings.
Older brother Billy (William C.) became sporting editor of the "St. Louis Globe-Democrat" and persuaded Al to move to that city in 1875, where he was soon covering baseball for the Missouri, later St. Louis "Republican". The city's first fully professional baseball team, the original St. Louis Brown Stockings were then in operation, contesting the championship of the U.S. in the National Association and then the National League.
Not long after the Browns went out of business in December 1877, the Spink brothers began thinking about how to restore professional baseball in their city. Unfortunately, spectator interest in the game had been damaged by the scandal that persuaded the Browns to drop out, and they struggled to organize a team of former pros playing cooperatively.
Al Spink helped turn the trick in 1881, establishing the Sportsman's Park and Club Association with Chris von der Ahe, whose first work was to acquire and renovate the old Grand Avenue ballpark (as Sportsman's Park). Spink organized a new Brown Stockings team and booked games with other western teams, especially one organized by Cincinnati baseball writer O.P. Caylor and billed as the Cincinnati Red Stockings. The success of independent commercial baseball in 1881, especially in St. Louis, inspired organization of the American Association league for 1882, with Sportsman's Park and Club its member from St. Louis. The writers Spink and Caylor remained influential although the clubs were owned by men of "greater substance".
Al Spink founded "The Sporting News" in March 1886. Each number was 17 by 22 inches, eight pages, price five cents (Cooper 1996). The leading baseball newspapers were then based in the East, the weeklies "Clipper" and "Sporting Life" in New York and Philadelphia. By World War I, "TSN" would be the only national baseball newspaper. Al Spink had long turned it over to his younger brother Charles, hiring Charles as business manager in the 1880s, selling his stock in 1894, and finally departing from writing and editorial work in 1899 (Cooper 1996).
His nephew, J. G. Taylor Spink, took over "The Sporting News" in 1914.
Some time after leaving "TSN", Al moved to Chicago where he would eventually write for the "Evening Post". In 1910, revised in 1911, he published one of the first baseball histories, "The National Game". One section organized by city is full of detail on early amateur and independent organizations and players, including 20 pages for his adopted city, "The Game in St. Louis". Another section consists of short entries on more than one hundred baseball writers with dozens of portrait photos. The sections on players organized by fielding position are not unique, but they remain a treasure trove because Spink did not focus exclusively on major league players or major league spans of careers.
Spink died 1928 in Oak Park, Illinois, almost 74 years old. He was the uncle of sportswriter Ernest J. Lanigan, who compiled the first encyclopedia of baseball, "The Baseball Cyclopedia".

Gunda (1998 film)

Gunda () is a 1990 Indian Hindi-language action film written by Bashir Babbar and directed by Kanti Shah. Starring Mithun Chakraborty, Mukesh Rishi and Shakti Kapoor, the film was produced by Anil Singh and the music was composed by Anand Raj Anand.The narrative revolves around a coolie who vows to exact revenge upon a crime lord and his cronies after they kill his loved ones. The film was released on 4 September 1998. Over time, the film has gained a cult following, selling over 2,000 VCD copies at a single outlet. It also received a limited re-release in 2018. The same year, actor Deepak Shirke who played politician Bachubhai, revealed that the film was pitched to him without a script.
Plot.
The story begins with two corrupt politicians hiring rival crime lords Lambu Aatta and Bulla to eliminate each other. Lambu Aatta kicks off the bloodshed by killing one of Bulla’s lackeys, only for Bulla to retaliate by murdering Lambu Aatta’s brother. Not to be outdone, Lambu Aatta escalates the depravity by raping and killing Bulla’s sister. Bulla, predictably, kills Lambu Aatta, claiming the underworld crown.
Enter Shankar, a coolie, who lives with his policeman father, sister Geeta, and a pet monkey named Tinku. Geeta' friend Ganga loves Shankar but Shankar does not care for her. He enters a fighting contest run by Bulla to help a laborer finance his daughter’s wedding and defeats Bulla’s champion.
Shankar’s policeman father tries to stop the extortion racket run by Bulla's goons and gets beaten up by them but Shankar arrives and fights them off. Bulla’s revenge takes a darker turn when his henchman Naate kidnaps Geeta, who’s briefly saved by Gulshan, only for it to be revealed as a trap. Gulshan marries her, then hands her over to Bulla's brother Chuttiya, who rapes and kills her and then dumps her body in a jungle. Tinku, the monkey, leads Shankar to Geeta's dead body, leading Shankar to swear to kill Bulla and all his henchmen within 10 days.

Reception.
Controversy.
On its release in 1998, the film had to be withdrawn from theaters due to complaints received by the Central Board of Film Certification from college girls who were appalled by the excessive violence, sex and obscenity in the film. The film had earlier been rejected by the Central Board of Film Certification due to use of filthy language and obscenity, it was later passed with an A certificate after the film makers made changes to the film. It was alleged that the version running in theaters prior to the withdrawal was the unedited print. The cases filed from Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore have since been withdrawn and the movie has also been cleared.

NY Salon

NY Salon is an organization based in New York City composed of intellectuals, academics, artists, and public personalities. They collaborate with foundations, universities, and notable individuals to host discussions of today's issues, design lectures and debates, and hold forums to review controversies.
Programs.
In September 2005, the Salon collaborated with WNYC, Brian Lehrer, and the CUNY Graduate Center to stage Reflections on the Future: Politics in the 21st Century featuring authors Russell Jacoby, Richard Sennett, and Frank Furedi.
In June 2006, they worked with the New York Society for Ethical Culture to present: "Is There a Culture of Corruption in Politics and Business?".
In September 2006 they began a series of four public forums with The New School and The Rose &amp; Erwin Wolfson Center for National Affairs about the culture of fear in America. "At a time when people are safer and live longer than ever before, every day new media driven fears fuel our sense that the sky is falling in. Underlying all of this is a concern that human civilization has perhaps gone too far and we should be more cautious – particularly of other people. Few put forward a positive view of what the future holds in store.
Crossing the boundaries between literature, philosophy and sociology, this series of four international panel discussions promises to be relevant, stimulating and perhaps a little controversial. The speakers will be asked to address the wider consequences of reorganizing our lives around the “better safe than sorry” motto."
Founding.
NY Salon was founded by Alan D Miller and Jean Smith.

ATEbank

The Agricultural Bank of Greece was a commercial bank based in Athens, Greece. The bank was founded in 1929. The bank proclaimed that it would focus on the Balkan bank market, with the business activities of supporting of the agricultural sector. ATEbank held a strong position at Athens Stock Exchange and has become a member of Piraeus Bank in the year 2013.
The Bank's development of business activities called for a new name and corporate image as ATEbank.
History.
1929 / Foundation. Agricultural Bank of Greece is founded as a non-profit organisation, provider of credit to the agricultural sector. The bank mainly aims at implementing programmes for financing both the activities of the primary sector of the economy and the processing and marketing of agricultural products, and enhancing rural development.
1950 Expansion of activities in the agricultural sector. Agricultural Bank founds a number of companies, which produce farming products and exploit resources all over the country.
1990 Expansion of activities in the non-agricultural sector. Agricultural Bank of Greece expands in the non-agricultural sector, by developing both a broad branch network all over Greece and a variety of new financial products and services.
1991 Transition to S.A. Agricultural Bank becomes S.A., broadens the spectrum of banking and financial services and acquires participating interests in specialised financial companies, thereby expanding the ABG group of companies.
2000 Entrance in the Athens Stock Exchange. Agricultural Bank increases its capital in order to enter Athens Stock Exchange, where its shares are listed since January 2001
2004 - 2006 Strengthening of the corporate image and positioning of the bank. The Bank by implementing a wide range of reforms and restructuring programs, and developing its branch network competitiveness and productivity, manages to achieve high growth rates which are depicted in the financial statements of both the Bank and the Group.
In particular:
An increase in the Bank’s share capital took place, amounting to €1.25 billion (June 2005). This capital increase allowed the Bank to deal with the problems encountered after adopting the International Accounting Standards (IAS) and has hence contributed to the substantial reorganization of the Bank’s financial statements.
The Bank implemented the Panotokia Law, which benefited in total 63.220 debtors of whom 54.000 were farmers. Loans written off amounted to EUR 1.8 billion of which EUR 1.1 billion concerned debts of farmers. In November 2005, the share of the Bank became a constituent of the FTSE/Athex 20 Index. The Bank’s corporate identity was changed in association with the new logo “ΑΤΕbank” on the branches and ATMs. The Board of Directors distributed for the first time a dividend per share out of the profit for the year 2005. The Bank expands in the Balkans’ area by purchasing MINDΒank (July 2006) and getting permission for bancassurance operations in Romania.
In July 2010 the bank failed the Eurozone stress test which required 6% Tier 1 capital to be maintained after the test. An increase in the Bank’s share capital took place in July 2011, amounting to €1.3 billion.
The good parts of the bank were taken over by Piraeus Bank in 2012, but its branches continued to bear the ATEbank corporate image until the summer of 2013.
Expansion.
Romania.
As a part of strategy of expansion in Balkan in 2006 ATEbank acquired majority stake in Romania's Mind Bank.
Serbia.
On 11.09.2006 ATE Bank announced it had acquired 24.99 pct of common and 24.99 pct of preferential shares of Serbia's Aik Bank, Niš for an undisclosed amount. AIK Bank Nis is listed on the Belgrade Stock Exchange, it's the most profitable bank in Serbia and has a 3 pct market share.

Guysborough, Nova Scotia (community)

Guysborough (population: 397) is an unincorporated village in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, located in Guysborough County.
Located at the head of Chedabucto Bay, fronting Guysborough Harbour, it is the administrative seat of the Guysborough municipal district. The community is named after Sir Guy Carleton (Guy's borough).
The area was first settled by the French in 1634. The Acadian population left the region in the early 1760's and English settlers began arriving shortly afterwards. The current settlement of Guysborough was founded by loyalists in 1784, after the America Revolutionary War. 
History.
The Mi'kmaq frequented the area, and had a seasonal settlement just south of present day Guysborough near present day Cook's Cove. 
French Settlement - Chedabuctou.
The site of present day Guysborough was first occupied by French Europeans in 1634, led by Isaac de Razilly, a French nobleman and Navy officer who later became Governor of French Acadia. He built Fort St François à Canso at the entrance to the harbour, on the peninsula known today as Fort Point. In 1655, Nicolas Denys, governor of the new St Lawrence Bay Province, renamed the area to Chedabuctou and built Fort Chedabuctou at the site of the Razilly's fort to serve as his capital.
In the early 1680's, Clerbaud Bergier, a French Huguenot merchant from La Rochelle, France, led other French merchants in founding the Company of Acadia (Compagnie de la Peche Sedentaire), and established Fort St. Louis to control the regions fishery. Settlers were brought to support the fort and fishery, and the village of Chedabuctou grew next to the fort, as well as farming activity farther inland along the Milford Haven River. A group cleared land and spent the winter of 1682 at Chedabuctou, with the first crops being planted in 1683. By 1687, several families were living at Chedabuctou, as well as soldiers and many seasonal fishermen. 
Raid on Chedabucto (1688).
In August of 1688, during King William's War, raiders from New England pillage the fort and fishery. The fort is taken when a soldier opens the gate in the morning and all the others are still asleep, leading to the lone soldier being overwhelmed by the raiders hiding near the gate. The pillaging of the fort is a financial disaster for the company, with several large ships being captured. In the aftermath of this failure, the Company of Acadia is reorganised and a garrison of French Troupes de la Marine are stationed at Fort St. Louis, and the defences are enhanced by a French military engineer.
Battle at Chedabucto (1690).
Later in King William's War, as part of Sir William Phips's expedition to destroy the capital of Acadia, Port Royal, Phips sent Captain Cyprian Southack to Chedabacto with 80 men to destroy Fort St. Louis and the surrounding French fishery. Southack landed his troops at present day Cook's Cove and proceeded overland to attack the fort. The French garrison of 25 soldiers defended the fort for over six hours, inflicting loses on the New Englanders. Southack led his men close to the fort and used fire bombs to set the fort ablaze, with the French troops surrendering. Southack spent several days demolishing the fort and destroying the enormous amount of 50,000 crowns of fish.
The fort was reopened in 1692 to protect the Acadians of Chedabuctou from further attacks. The Company of Acadia once again reformed and reestablished itself at Chedabuctou in 1697, but encountered a variety of difficulties on the way to its final disappearance in 1702. In 1712, the area was granted to French privateer Bernard Lasonde for services during Queen Anne's War. Lasonde swore allegiance to the British following the Treaty of Utrecht, but also worked against them for the French, who still claimed the Chedabuctou/Canso region. Per a British survey in 1718, there were approximately 300 Acadians living in the area, including both settled families and seasonal fishermen.
Raid on Chedacacto (1718) - The "Squirrel" Affair.
Shortly after Southack established himself at Shelburne, Nova Scotia, the Mi'kmaq raided the station and burned it to the ground. In response, from 17–24 September 1718, Southack led a raid on Canso and Chedabucto in what became known as the "Squirrel" Affair. Southack first destroyed the fishing village on the Canso Islands. Southack then laid siege for three days to Fort St. Louis, which was defended primarily by the local Acadians. On 18 September, British marines landed across the harbour from the fort on Lasonde's Grave (today McCauls Island) and seized the entrance to Chedabucto Harbour. The following day HMS "Squirrel" landed troops at Salmon River, who proceeded to the rear of the village. HMS "Squirrel" made its first attempt to enter the harbour but was beaten back by the Acadian cannon fire from the fort. Later in the day the village was captured by the landed troops. On 20 September HMS "Squirrel" made a second attempt to enter the harbour, and successfully fired upon the fort. On 23 September, Southack burned the village and loaded the goods onto the French transports that had been captured in the harbour. On 24 September, after pillaging and burning the village, Southack released his Acadian prisoners onto the Canso Islands and sailed back to Boston. Some Acadians fled to Isle Madame after the attack.
The village of Chedabucto recovered after the 1718 attack, but the fort was never reestablished. The Acadian community here sold food and boats to Louisbourg. When the Acadian expulsion began in 1755, Chedabucto became an important stopping point for Acadians fleeing to Isle Royale. The village encountered hard times after the fall of Louisbourg, and the Acadians are recorded to have fully left the region by 1764, at least 70 of whom settled on Saint Pierre and Miquelon.
Loyalist Settlement - Guysborough.
British settlers first arrived in the late 1760's, shortly after the Acadians left the region. They called the area Milfort, and later Milford, referencing the ruined fort near to them.
After the American Revolution, large numbers of Loyalists and soldiers of the disbanded Duke of Cumberland's Regiment and King's Carolina Rangers settled in the area and were given land grants. These Loyalists named their new settlement Guysborough after Sir Guy Carleton, commander of the British forces and Governor General of British North America in the 1780s. Large numbers of Black Loyalists, led by Thomas Brownspriggs, also settled near Guysborough. 
In 1790, they built the first Anglican Church in the area and Rev. Peter de la Roche was the first minister. He arrived from Lunenburg after having signed a ransom agreement with American privateers in the Raid on Lunenburg, Nova Scotia (1782).
A coastal gun battery, known as "Manchester Battery" and a blockhouse, known as the "Guysborough Blockhouse" was built on the site of the old French fort to defend the town's harbour by the British during the War of 1812.
The town's fine natural harbour led to its establishment as the administrative centre for the county. The 1800's saw the village grow into a town, and become a major economic hub for the region. Shipbuilding was a major industry until the early 20th century. Following the development of road networks and rail lines, the harbour's importance diminished and the population of the town began to decline.
Demographics.
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Guysborough had a population of 397 living in 166 of its 185 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 363. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The Deep End (film)

The Deep End is a 2001 American thriller film written, directed, and produced by Scott McGehee and David Siegel. It stars Tilda Swinton, Goran Visnjic, Jonathan Tucker, and Josh Lucas and was released by Fox Searchlight Pictures. The film was very loosely adapted from the novel "The Blank Wall" by Elisabeth Sanxay Holding (filmed in 1949 by Max Ophüls as "The Reckless Moment"). The film premiered in competition at the Sundance Film Festival where English cinematographer Giles Nuttgens won the Best Cinematography award.
Plot.
Margaret Hall and her family live an upper middle class life in Lake Tahoe, California. She herself runs the household, which includes her three children and elderly father-in-law, as her Navy pilot husband is away on the aircraft carrier USS "Constellation". One day, she is startled to discover that her son Beau, a high school senior, has been having a sexual affair with 30-year-old Reno, Nevada, nightclub owner Darby Reese. Margaret visits Reese's nightclub, The Deep End, to demand that he stay away from her son. Reese demands $5,000 from her in exchange. That night, a drunken Reese secretly visits Beau and the two meet in the boathouse. Beau confronts him about asking his mother for money. The two argue, eventually coming to blows. As Beau returns to the house, Reese leans on a railing, causing it to collapse. He falls into the water, impaling himself on an anchor.
The next morning, Margaret discovers Reese's body on the beach. Believing that her son killed Reese, Margaret hides the body to protect Beau. She removes the body and dumps it in a cove, but police soon discover the body and investigate the case as a homicide. Soon after, a man named Alek Spera confronts Margaret with a tape of Darby and Beau having sex. Alek demands $50,000 in 24 hours or he will turn the tape over to the police, which would implicate Beau as a suspect.
To get the money, Margaret goes to the bank and sells her jewelry at a pawn shop, but she is unsuccessful in coming up with the full amount. Alek calls Margaret the next day and tells her that she needs to get only $25,000 but Alek's partner, Nagle, is convinced she is lying about not being able to raise the money. Nagle corners and beats Margaret but Alek arrives and the two men scuffle, resulting in Alek strangling Nagle. Margaret attempts to take responsibility for Nagle's death, but Alek takes the body away in Nagle's car. As Margaret and her son drive looking for Nagle's car, they see it overturned in a ditch. Margaret attempts to free Alek, who is critically injured. Alek pleads with her to leave before the police arrive. Margaret stays until Alek dies.
Back at home, Margaret, in a state of distress, is comforted by Beau. Another phone call is heard coming in from the absent husband, answered by Beau's sister. The Halls' normal life resumes.
Production.
The film was shot on location in North Lake Tahoe area, including Kings Beach, Crystal Bay and Incline Village.
Reception.
"The Deep End" received positive reviews from critics. 
Tilda Swinton's performance was widely praised. Roger Ebert wrote "The Deep End" "is the kind of crime movie where the everyday surroundings make the violence seem all the more shocking and gruesome". In "The New York Times", Elvis Mitchell said the film "is fastidious and smart, and Ms. Swinton's fixated intensity isn't ever remote; we're always aware of how deeply she's feeling. Her work is magnificent, an actress burrowing inside herself to play a woman doing the most horrible thing in the world to restore order to her life". Stephanie Zacharek of "Salon" commented "Visnjic adds gradual layers to his performance; its depth and resonance smolder like glowing charcoal", and praised the film's visuals, cinematography, and use of noir elements. She concluded "The Deep End" "is completely modern-feeling, all cool and no camp, but it's still refreshingly unapologetic about the way it taps into those secret moviegoing parts of us".

A Drama in Mexico

"A Drama in Mexico" () is a historical short story by Jules Verne, first published in July 1851 under the title "L'Amérique du Nord, études historiques: Les Premiers Navires de la marine mexicaine."
In a letter to his father Verne wrote that it "is but a simple adventure-story in the style of [James Fenimore] Cooper which I am locating in Mexico."
Plot outline.
In 1825, off the islands of Guam on a passage from Spain, Lieutenant Martinez, and his associates plot a mutiny on board of two Spanish warships. Conspirators murder Captain Don Orteva, take command of the ships, and plan to sell them to the republican government in Mexico. On arrival in Acapulco, Lieutenant Martinez and Jose embark on a cross-country trip to Mexico City to effect the sale. Martinez becomes increasingly fearful that he is being pursued by Ortega's loyal followers, and during a stormy night in the mountains murders Jose in a moment of madness and is then toppled to his death in a mountain torrent by the men he feared.
Publication history.
The story was originally published in French in July 1851 as "L'Amérique du Nord, études historiques: Les Premiers Navires de la marine mexicaine" in "Musée des familles" with three illustrations by Eugène Forest and Alexandre de Bar. A renamed and revised version, "Un drame au Mexique," with six illustrations by Jules Férat, was published in 1876 together with the novel "Michel Strogoff" as a part of the "Voyages Extraordinaires" series. The first English translation by W. H. G. Kingston was published in London in 1876.

<doc id="6947476" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6947476" title="Cordyline indivisa">
Cordyline indivisa

Cordyline indivisa is a monocot tree endemic to New Zealand. It is commonly known as mountain cabbage tree or bush flax. It is also known as the broad-leaved cabbage tree, and in the Māori language as .
Distribution.
In the North Island, "Cordyline indivisa" occurs from south of Kohukohunui in the Hunua Ranges and Te Moehau (Coromandel Peninsula) but becomes common only south of Raukūmara Ranges and the central Volcanic Plateau. In the South Island it is widespread and common along the north and western portions of the island, but occurs more locally in the drier eastern regions.
Description.
"C. indivisa" is very distinctive. The species can be distinguished from all other "Cordyline" species by its very broad blue-grey leaves, and its smaller, tightly compacted inflorescence which is produced from beneath the foliage. It forms a stout tree up to tall, with a trunk from in diameter. The stem is usually unbranched, or has very few branches. The leaves are long, and from wide. The foliage, which droops with age, is blue-green and shaped like a broad sword, with a broad and conspicuous midrib which is often tinged red, orange red or golden. The inflorescence is a panicle that arises from the base of the growing points underneath the leaves.
Conservation.
The mountain cabbage tree is not regarded as threatened. Nonetheless, some northern populations have been greatly reduced by livestock and goats, which are thought to have caused its local extinction on Mount Moehau at the northern tip of the Coromandel Peninsula. Since 1987, some species of "Cordyline" in New Zealand have been affected by a disease called "Sudden Decline", caused by the pathogen "Phytoplasma australiense". The sudden death of some specimens of "C. indivisa" in cultivation and in the wild has been attributed to this disease, but it is still not clear if this was in fact the case.
Māori cultural use.
The fronds of "Cordyline indivisa" were prized in traditional Māori weaving as a fibre to create rain capes, better suited to the task than other "Cordyline" species due to the plant's wider leaves. 
Cultivation.
It is a very attractive tree, but it has a tendency to collapse suddenly during high temperatures or in times of water shortage. It prefers cool moist soils, and semi-shade, and is easy to grow in the cooler parts of New Zealand. North of Hamilton, it can only be grown with great difficulty but few plants survive long enough to flower in lowland areas.
Nomenclature.
"C. indivisa" may be confused with another cabbage tree, "Cordyline australis". In particular the popular annual house or ornamental plant, sold under the common name "Spikes" or "Dracaena Spikes", which is an immature form of "C. australis", is incorrectly sold as "Cordyline indivisa" or "Dracaena indivisa". ("Dracaena" is a closely related genus from which some species have been reclassified as "Cordyline".)

Pieter Hellendaal

Pieter Hellendaal (1 April 1721 – 19 April 1799) was a Dutch composer, organist and violinist.
At the age of 30, he migrated to England where he lived for the last 48 of his 78 years, and where he was known as Peter Hellendaal. He was one of the most notable 18th-century composers of Dutch origin. His son, also Peter Hellendaal (sometimes known as Peter Hellendaal the younger) was also a professional musician.
Life.
Early and student years.
Hellendaal was born in Rotterdam on 1 April 1721, the son of Neeltje Lacroix and Johannes Hellendaal. Johannes earned a living to support his family as a candle-maker while seeking paid gigs, and teaching and working with amateur musicians. As a father, Johannes provided his son Pieter with an intense musical education, including organ and violin. In addition to his highly creative compositions and prodigious craft as a performer, Pieter in maturity maintained himself by compositions and self-publications that respected and supported amateur musicians.
In 1731, the Hellendaal family moved to Utrecht where Pieter – still juvenile – became organist for the church, a highly visible and prestigious position: Popularly known as the "Santa Claus" Church, St. Nicholas was the second oldest parish church in the Netherlands and had been recognized for many centuries as a leader for organ music. In 1120 it was already well known as the first Dutch church to use a portable organ. The main organ in the 1730s had been built by Peter Gerritsz during the years 1477 to 1479, and is the first large Dutch organ and was famous as one of the first and best preserved anywhere from the Middle Ages. Under Johannes' supervision, son Pieter at age ten played the . From January 1732 (when Pieter was about twelve) until 1737 he was appointed an organist. In that year, when Pieter was 15, the Hellendaal family moved, this time to Amsterdam.
Soon after their arrival, Pieter's outstanding talent as a violinist came to the attention of the Amsterdam city Secretary, Mattheus Lestevenon, who arranged for him (barely sixteen) to study in Italy where he stayed for six years (1737–1743). For two years of this journey (1740–1742) he studied in Padua at the Scuola delle nazioni with Giuseppe Tartini, the most famous violinist of that time.
After returning to Amsterdam in 1742, and much as his father had in his earlier years, Pieter sought an audience wherever he could, and sought paying gigs whenever possible, such as playing in the hostels of the city. Finally, two years later in 1744, he stempted to settle down by two actions that set much of the tone for the rest of his life. First, he married the daughter of a well-off Amsterdam city surgeon and started a family. Second, he obtained an official permit to start his own publishing house. Soon after permitted, he published his first two works: two sets of sonatas for violin and basso continuo. Self-publishing his own works, including widening his market with extra directions to support performance by amateur musicians, became a hallmark of his life until his death.
To support his family despite not having found an established musical job, Hellendaal free-lanced, seeking gigs in The Hague and Leiden. In The Hague, the capital of the Dutch Republic, he performed regularly in the noble court of the Governor, or "Stadtholder", sometime translated as Lieutenant, an office which eventually became the Monarch. There he played for Prince William IV, and especially for the Prince's English wife, Anne of Hanover, whose enthusiasm made her known as "the musical princess". Perhaps Anne put in his mind to better his finances by moving to England where much of society was similarly enthusiastic about music, and thus there were for better prospects for a better money as a musician.
In Leiden, Hellendaal played the organ regularly in the Mare church, named for its location on Mare Street, a central arterial in downtown, and formerly a canal which had been paved over. Like the St Nicholas church in Utrecht, it was well known as one of the first Protestant churches in Netherlands. Hellendaal did find a stream of paid gigs, playing for and with music enthusiasts and amateurs around the University of Leiden. For two years, 1749 until 1751, he continued his musical studies at that university.
England.
In 1752, at age thirty, Hellendaal gave up the sporadic pay of the free-lance life, and moved his family to England where great numbers of the newly prosperous middle-class—as well as the nobility—were music enthusiasts as well as amateur players, and much work was available as a teacher and performer for musicians of notable ability.
In London, Hellendaal soon established himself as a prominent composer and violin soloist. London newspapers during his eight years there gave conspicuous notice to his frequent performances at such then-prestigious venues as Hickford's Rooms on Brewer Street, and the many other venues set up by entrepreneurs to serve the interests of the widespread musical enthusiasm of English society. His prominence gained the attention and the acquaintance of George Frideric Handel, who on 13 February 1754 helped Hellendaal be paid for violin solos between the acts of "Acis and Galatea" (HWV49a/b).
Still unable to secure a good steady job as a musician in London, Hellendaal, from 1760 to 1762, made his living expenses by working as the organist for St. Margaret's Church in King's Lynn, Norfolk, a port town about 97 miles north of London – a steady job, but not yet satisfactory to sustain his family, and not convenient for the distance from London.
Cambridge University.
At the age of forty, in 1762, Hellendaal moved to Cambridge, where the musical enthusiasm in academic circles around the University allowed him to settle down for the rest of his life. First, he was hired as an organist for Pembroke College, Cambridge, and was able to teach, give concerts, and compose. Fifteen years later, in 1777, he was appointed organist in the Chapel of Peterhouse where he worked until he died 37 years later in 1799, at the age of 78. He is buried in the church yard of the next door church, Little St Mary's.
Peter Hellendaal, a.k.a. 'The Younger'.
Born circa 1756 in London and given his father's name, the son is known as Pieter Hellendaal (the Younger), or simply in the name's English form, Peter.
Peter became a violinist, clarinetist, and arranger/composer. He actively collaborated in his father's self-publishing during the 1790s, helping send to market a stream of various musical publications. For example, to serve the needs of parish churches, he selected and arranged for publication pieces from the Elder's "Collection of Psalms and Hymns". This publication also included one of Peter's own compositions.
The last notice of Peter's life was from 17 April 1801 when he was the soloist in a benefit concert which performed a concerto written by his father. He died later that year, at the age of 45, outliving his father by only two years.
Works.
His works include virtuoso violin sonatas in the Italian late Baroque style; "Three Grand Lessons for keyboard, violin, and continuo" (published ca. 1790); a cantata, and vocal works (including canons, catches, and glees).
His "Six Concerti Grossi" (published c. 1758, Op. 3, in eight parts) retained the older style – where several different soloists interact with a somewhat larger group of players who provide the larger orchestral texture. This genre retained its popularity in England for decades after it became unfashionable on the Continent.

Wasteland (comics)

Wasteland is a monthly comic book series written by Antony Johnston, drawn by Christopher Mitten with covers by Ben Templesmith, and published by Oni Press. It debuted in July 2006 and ended in April 2015.
The series is set one hundred years after the Big Wet, an unspecified disaster that destroyed modern society and, it is assumed, changed the world's coastlines. The story takes place somewhere in America, now a barren desert and dustbowl without modern technology. The seas are poisonous, and subsistence farming with small amounts of livestock appears to be the norm.
The book also has theme music, composed and performed by Johnston, which can be downloaded from the official website.
Format.
Each issue of "Wasteland" is 32 pages long (with the exception of issue #1, which was a special double length premiere) and contains 22 pages of comic story, one episode of the prose serial travelogue "Walking The Dust", a letters column and preview page for the following issue. The remainder of the pages are taken up by ads, normally for other series from Oni Press and/or by "Wasteland"'s creators.
The letters column sometimes contains pieces of submitted fan art, and Johnston himself often answers the letters.
The Big Wet.
The most-seen explanation for the apocalypse comes from the Sunner religion, a sect that worships Mother Sun and Father Moon. According to their legend, the Big Wet was a retribution on the people of A-Ree-Yass-I for shunning the 'gifts' Mother Sun and Father Moon offered them. It seems as though this mythic place's name is a play on words by the author, and a linguistic contraction in-world, for "Area 1/I" (or perhaps "Area SI" = Area 51)—a military base/lab where the bomb was created.
Storylines.
Thus far, the comic has established two distinct storylines. The first follows a scavenger named Michael who roams the wasteland, trading what he can salvage. His life changes forever when he finds a machine that talks in a forgotten language, supposedly giving directions to the fabled land of A-Ree-Yass-I, where mankind's downfall began. Michael tries to trade the machine at a small town of Sunners called Providence, and his fate becomes intertwined with the town's sheriff, Abi.
The second storyline follows the political machinations of a large city known as Newbegin, where the city's leader Marcus (aka Lord Founder) is oppressing the Sunner population, most of whom are slaves.
Sunner beliefs.
Sunners have been shown to hold the following beliefs:
Collections.
Oni are releasing trade paperback collections on an ongoing basis.
The series was afflicted by serious delays after issue #26. Issue #27, originally planned for July 2009 was delayed to January 2010, mainly due to Johnston's involvement with Dead Space, and other projects.
As of July 2009, Oni are also releasing hardcover collections.

Baron Vaea

Siaosi ʻAlipate Halakilangi Tau’alupeoko Vaea Tupou (15 May 1921 – 7 June 2009), more commonly known as Baron Vaea of Houma, was a Tongan politician who served as Prime Minister of Tonga. Vaea was a nephew of Queen Sālote, who ruled Tonga from 1918 until 1965, and a member of the Tongan nobility. His career in the Tongan government spanned 54 years.
Vaea was prime minister from 22 August 1991 until 2000 under the late King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV. He had previously served as Tonga's first High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1969 until 1972, as well as in various ministerial posts from 1972 until his appointment as prime minister by King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV in 1991.
The late Vaea and his wife, Baroness Tuputupu Vaea, are the parents of the current Queen of Tonga, Nanasipauʻu Tukuʻaho.
Biography.
Early life.
Siaosi ʻAlipate Halakilangi Tau’alupeoko Vaea Tupou was born on 15 May 1921 to parents Vīlai Tupou and Tupou Seini. His father, Vīlai Tupou, was the half brother of Queen Sālote, while his mother, Tupou Seini, was the daughter of a Tongan nobleman named Vaea. He attended Wesley College, Auckland, from 1938 until 1941. He enlisted in the Royal New Zealand Air Force following his graduation from high school and the outbreak of World War II. Vaea served as a pilot in the Air Force from 1942 until 1945 piloting PBY Catalina reconnaissance flying boats.
Government career.
Vaea began working for the government of Tonga in January 1945 following his departure from the Royal New Zealand Air Force. He served his aunt, Queen Sālote, as Aide-de-Camp from 1953 until 1958.
He became the Governor of Ha'apai in 1960, a position he held until 1968. He became Tonga's first High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1969 until 1972. While High Commissioner he was given the title of Baron.
He was appointed to numerous government ministerial portfolios in the Tongan Cabinet beginning in 1972. Vaea was appointed as Tonga's first Minister of Labour and Commerce, and Industries, which he held from 1972 until 1991. As labour minister, Vaea was responsible for the construction of the Small Industries Centre in Ma'ufanga.
Vaea was simultaneously appointed Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in 1975, a position which he continued to hold until his official retirement from government in 2000. Additionally, Vaea also headed the Tongan Ministries of Civil Aviation, Tourism, Education and Marine and Ports, at various points during his career.
Prime Minister of Tonga.
Baron Vaea of Houma applied for retirement from government and civil service in the early 1990s. However, soon after submitting his retirement application, King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV appointed Vaea as Prime Minister of Tonga. Vaea's predecessor, Fatafehi Tu'ipelehake had resigned from office in 1991 due to declining health. He took office on 22 August 1991, becoming the 12th prime minister of Tonga since 1876.
Vaea served as prime minister under King Taufa’ahau Tupou IV from 1991 and 2000. He attended the inaugural Pacific Alliance Leaders Meeting (PALM) in 1997, a gathering of Pacific Islands Forum nations spearheaded by Japan to enhance cooperation between the Japanese and Pacific Islands governments. Each of Vaea's successors has attended following meetings since 1997.
Vaea's resignation from office was accepted by King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV in 2000, and Vaea was able to retire from government at the age of 78. With a career in the Tongan government and civil service spanning 54 years, Vaea remains one of Tonga's longest serving civil servants.
Later life.
In an interview with "Matangi Tonga" during his retirement, Vaea expressed concern for a number of issues affecting Tonga, including the decreasing supplies of the country's fresh water supplies, the environment, the need for additional capital funds and the negative outlook of many Tongan young people. He also stated that the government should encourage Tongans to enter the business world. Vaea seemed to encourage progress and change in Tonga saying in the interview, "Sometimes I think it would be best if Tonga changed, . . . we should let go of some of our beliefs and the way that we do things that seem to weigh us down."
Death.
Baron Vaea died at his residence, 'Tali ki Ha'apai', in Houma, Tongatapu, Tonga, on 7 June 2009, at approximately 10 pm He was 88 years old. Vaea had sought medical treatment in New Zealand, before returning to Tonga in late May 2009. He had been bedridden since May. Vaea's body was kept at his home in Houma until his funeral.
Baron Vaea of Houma was survived by his wife, Baroness Tuputupu Vaea, as well as five of their six children and one adopted daughter. The couple's children are HM Queen Nanasipauʻu Tukuʻaho, 'Alipate Tu'ivanuavou Vaea, 'Amelia Luoluafetu'u Vaea, Luseane Luani and Cassandra Tuku'aho (of Tu'ivanuavou Vaea). Vaea was predeased by two sons, Moimoikimofuta Kaifahina Vaea and Ratu Edward Vaea.
Vaea's funeral began at 11 am on 13 June 2009. A funeral procession commenced from his residence, called Tali ki Ha'apai, in Houma, to nearby Kolomanatau Cemetery for funeral ceremonies and burial.

Peter Štefan

Peter Štefan (27 March 1941 in Bratislava, Slovak Republic – 18 June 1978 in Tryfan, Wales) was a Slovak mathematician who was known for his works on dynamical systems and mathematical entropy.
He attended school in Bratislava, and then Charles University in Prague. In 1968, he was involved in politics in Czechoslovakia, supporting the political movement that sought to humanize Communist rule during the Prague Spring. As he was visiting the University of Warwick, though, the Soviet Union and several Warsaw Pact allies invaded the country, installing a Soviet-controlled regime. Štefan feared that he would be in danger if he returned, and he decided to stay in Britain. He remained in Warwick, where he studied for a Ph.D. which was awarded in 1973. His thesis was on "Accessibility and singular foliations", a topic which is important in control theory and in the mathematical theory of entropy.
He died while climbing Tryfan on 18 June 1978.

24 Minutes

"24 Minutes" is the twenty-first episode of the eighteenth season of the American animated television series "The Simpsons". It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 20, 2007 as part of the one-hour season finale, alongside the episode "You Kent Always Say What You Want". It was originally promoted as being the 400th episode, but was broadcast as the 399th. It was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and Billy Kimball. It was Kimball's first writing credit.
The episode is a spoof of the Fox television drama "24", and sees Principal Skinner's new Counter Truancy Unit (CTU), led by Lisa Simpson, attempting to prevent a stink bomb being released at Springfield Elementary School. Guest stars include Kiefer Sutherland and Mary Lynn Rajskub as their respective characters from "24", Jack Bauer and Chloe O'Brian.
The episode received critical acclaim and won the 2008 Annie Award for Best Writing in an Animated Television Production.
Plot.
To tackle misbehavior, Principal Skinner opens a CTU – Counter Truancy Unit – at Springfield Elementary School with Lisa heading up the operation over Milhouse, Martin and Database. When the bullies Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney play truant, Milhouse is assigned on a mission to spy on them. At the Power Plant, Homer is found to be the owner of a container of expired and highly pungent yogurt and is ordered to dispose of it. Homer tries to return the yogurt to Apu, but Apu refuses to take it due to its unbearable stench and, desperate to get rid of it, takes Homer to the yogurt section and offers him whatever he wants there. While Homer and Apu are distracted, the bullies take the yogurt. Outside, Homer unwittingly breaks Milhouse's cover, and the bullies throw them both into a dumpster and send it rolling down an avenue.
Meanwhile, Marge discovers that there is a bake sale at the school that day, and realizes she has just 27 minutes to make a cake. In order to save time, she drastically increases the oven temperature to 1,200 degrees, quickly burning the cake and making it rock-solid. Marge desperately attempts to cover it up with pink and white frosting before rushing to the bake sale.
Lisa suggests that Bart help them, though he only agrees after negotiating immunity from punishment for all his past and future pranks (and making Skinner teach him a new swear word). At Jimbo's house, the bullies make a powerful stink bomb (which resembles the canisters of Sentox Nerve Gas from season 5 of "24") from the expired yogurt and a variety of other putrid items, and plan on detonating it at the bake sale. During his investigation, Bart's phone call is accidentally crossed with a call from Jack Bauer of "24", who is busy in a gun battle, and turns it into a prank call against him ("Ahmed Adoudi").
Bart finds out about the stink bomb and informs Lisa. Upon returning to school, he discovers that Martin is a double-agent working for the bullies. Before Bart can tell Lisa about Martin's double-dealing, Martin knocks him unconscious and takes him to the ventilation room, where the bullies tie up Bart. When Willie stumbles upon the bullies, they overpower him and tie him up too. The bullies then return Martin's ant farm, which they had used to blackmail him into working for them, but Martin is devastated to learn one of their ants has joined the bullies' cause. Later, he hangs himself by his underwear on a clothing hook, giving himself a wedgie after putting on his hall monitor sash (as a homage to the suicide in "A Few Good Men" as well as that of the character Walt Cummings on Season 5 of "24," who is murdered and has his death framed as a hanging).
At the bake sale, the bullies start the three-minute timer for the bomb. Bart, still tied up, manages to contact Lisa by his cell phone, telling her to have Skinner dump the hot dog water to short circuit the ventilation fan. Skinner starts filling up the room with the water. Running out of air and floating dangerously close to the sharp ceiling fan blades, Bart swims down with the chair tied to his back to the room's only window, which faces the bake sale room. Chief Wiggum is unable to shoot through the bulletproof glass, but Marge then throws her burnt cake like a discus through the window, breaking the window and allowing Bart, Willie, the bomb, and all the water to flood into the room. Lisa defuses the bomb with one second to spare. Bauer and his CTU SWAT Team then arrive to arrest Bart for prank-calling him, having diverted all CTU's resources into finding him. As he says that, a nuclear bomb explodes in the distance, but to the crowd's relief Bauer assures them that it went off in neighboring Shelbyville.
Production.
An original idea saw Edgar Stiles from "24" appearing in the episode and being killed, but the concept was dropped.
Cultural references.
The title is a reference to the Fox show "24". The episode includes many of the show's hallmarks, such as the multiple split screens, the timer before and after the commercial break, and extended opening credits running over the opening scenes of the narrative. "24" characters Jack Bauer and Chloe O'Brian, voiced by their original portrayers, make cameo appearances.
Reception.
Robert Canning on "IGN" named "24 Minutes" the best episode of the season and gave it a 9.6/10 saying "this smart, funny, spot-on parody of "24" was so good that it came very close to redeeming the entire season." He also stated "Though much of Season Eighteen was quite mediocre, "24 Minutes" ranks up there with the best of all time".
In 2007, Simon Crerar of "The Times" listed Sutherland's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show.
In 2012, Johnny Dee of "The Guardian" listed the episode as one of his five favorite episodes in the history of "The Simpsons". He wrote: "One reason why The Simpsons has remained so watchable is that its parodies are getting sharper – The Departed in Debarted, The Da Vinci Code in Gone Maggie Gone. None though can top this excellent riff which begins with Kiefer Sutherland announcing 'Previously on 24... I mean The Simpsons,' and dispenses with its normal format completely for an entire episode of split-screen thrills, torture and cake baking."
Bernardo Sim of "Screen Rant" called it the best episode of the 18th season.
At the 35th Annie Awards, writers Ian Maxtone-Graham and Billy Kimball won the Annie Award for Outstanding Achievement for Writing in an Animated Television/Broadcast Production for this episode.

Cadeby Light Railway

The Cadeby Light Railway was a narrow-gauge railway in the garden of the rectory in Cadeby, Leicestershire.
In the early 1960s the Reverend Teddy Boston became rector of All Saints' Church, Cadeby. Boston was a lifelong railway enthusiast and wanted to build a miniature railway in his new garden, but the cost proved prohibitive. Instead he searched for a full-sized narrow-gauge locomotive. 
In 1962, he purchased "Pixie", a W.G. Bagnall from the Cranford quarry. The quarry owners donated a short length of track and two wagons and the Cadeby Light Railway was opened.
Over the years, Boston built an extensive collection of ex-industrial narrow-gauge rolling stock, which ran on the extremely short line in his garden. He also maintained an extensive OO gauge model railway at Cadeby.
Although Boston died in 1986, his widow, Audrey kept the railway open for nearly twenty years, holding regular open days. 
The railway finally closed in May 2005. The majority of the collection has been amalgamated with the Moseley Railway Trust at the Apedale Community Country Park. As of 2014, "Pixie" was undergoing restoration.

1890 British Ultimatum

The 1890 British Ultimatum was an ultimatum by the British government delivered on 11 January 1890 to the Kingdom of Portugal. Portugal had attempted to claim a large area of land between its colonies of Mozambique and Angola including most of present-day Zimbabwe and Zambia and a large part of Malawi, which had been included in Portugal's "Rose-coloured Map". The ultimatum led to the withdrawal of Portuguese forces from areas which had been claimed by Portugal on the basis of Portuguese exploration in the area, but which Britain claimed on the basis of "uti possidetis".
It has sometimes been claimed that the British government's objections arose because the Portuguese claims clashed with its aspirations to create a Cape to Cairo Railway, linking its colonies from the south of Africa to those in the north. This seems unlikely, as in 1890 Germany already controlled German East Africa, now Tanzania, and Sudan was independent under Muhammad Ahmad. Rather, the British government was pressed into taking action by Cecil Rhodes, whose British South Africa Company was founded in 1888 south of the Zambezi and the African Lakes Company and British missionaries to the north.
Background.
At the start of the 19th century, the Portuguese presence in Africa south of the equator was limited in Angola to Luanda and Benguela and a few outposts, the most northerly of which was Ambriz and in Mozambique to the Island of Mozambique, several other coastal trading posts as far south as Delagoa Bay and the virtually independent Prazo estates in the Zambezi valley The first challenge to Portugal's wider claims came from the Transvaal Republic, which in 1868 claimed an outlet to the Indian Ocean at Delagoa Bay. Although in 1869, Portugal and the Transvaal reached agreement on a border under which all of Delagoa Bay was Portuguese, the UK then lodged an objection, claiming the southern part of that bay. The claim was rejected after arbitration by President MacMahon of France. His award made in 1875 upheld the border agreed in 1869. A second challenge came from the foundation of a German colony at Angra Pequena, now known as Lüderitz in Namibia in 1883. Although there was no Portuguese presence there, Portugal had claimed it on the basis of discovery.
A far more serious dispute arose in the area of the Zambezi valley and Lake Nyasa. Portugal occupied the coast of Mozambique from the 16th century, and from 1853 the Portuguese government embarked on a series of military campaigns to bring the Zambezi valley under its effective control. During the 1850s, the areas south of Lake Nyasa (now Lake Malawi) and west of the lake were explored by David Livingstone and several Church of England and Presbyterian missions were established in the Shire Highlands in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1878, the African Lakes Company was established by businessmen with links to the Presbyterian missions. Their aim was to set up a trading company that would work in close cooperation with the missions to combat the slave trade by introducing legitimate trade and develop European influence in the area. A small mission and trading settlement was established at Blantyre in 1876.
Portugal attempted to assert its African territorial claims through three expeditions led by Alexandre de Serpa Pinto, first from Mozambique to the eastern Zambezi in 1869, then to the Congo and upper Zambezi from Angola in 1876 and lastly crossing Africa from Angola in 1877–1879. These expeditions were undertaken with the intention of claiming the area between Mozambique and Angola. Following Serpa Pinto's explorations, the Portuguese government in 1879 made a formal claim to the area south and east of the Ruo River (the present south-eastern border of Malawi) and, in 1882, occupied the lower Shire River valley as far as the Ruo. The Portuguese then asked the British government to accept this territorial claim, but the opening of the Berlin Conference of 1884–85 ended the discussions. Portugal's efforts to establish this corridor of influence between Angola and Mozambique were hampered by one of the articles in the General Act of the Berlin Conference which required "uti possidetis" of areas claimed rather than historical claims based on discovery or those based on exploration, as Portugal had used.
To validate Portuguese claims, Serpa Pinto was appointed as its consul in Zanzibar in 1884 and given the mission of exploring the region between Lake Nyasa and the coast from the Zambezi to the Rovuma River and securing the allegiance of the chiefs in that area. His expedition reached Lake Nyasa and the Shire Highlands but failed to make any treaties of protection with the chiefs in territories west of the lake. At the northwest end of Lake Nyasa around Karonga, the African Lakes Company made, or claimed to have made, treaties with local chiefs between 1884 and 1886. Its ambition was to become a chartered company and control the route from the lake along the Shire River.
Despite the outcome of the Berlin Conference, the idea of a trans-African Portuguese zone was not abandoned; to help to create it, Portugal signed treaties with France and Germany in 1886. The German treaty noted Portugal's claim to territory along the course of the Zambezi linking Angola and Mozambique. Following the treaties, the Portuguese foreign minister prepared what became known as the Rose Coloured Map, representing a claim stretching from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. North of the Zambezi, these Portuguese claims were opposed by both the African Lakes company and the missionaries. The main opposition to Portuguese claims in the south came from Cecil Rhodes, whose British South Africa Company was founded in 1888. As late as 1888, the British Foreign Office declined to offer protection to the tiny British settlements in the Shire Highlands. However, it did not accept the expansion of Portuguese influence there, and in 1889, it appointed Henry Hamilton Johnston as British consul to Mozambique and the Interior, and instructed him to report on the extent of Portuguese rule in the Zambezi and Shire valleys. He was also to make conditional treaties with local rulers outside Portuguese control. The conditional treaties did not establish a British protectorate but prevented the rulers from accepting protection from another state.
Ultimatum.
In 1888, the Portuguese government instructed its representatives in Mozambique to make treaties of protection with the Yao chiefs southeast of Lake Nyasa and in the Shire Highlands. Two expeditions were organised, one under Antonio Cardoso, a former governor of Quelimane, set off in November 1888 for Lake Nyasa; the second expedition under Serpa Pinto (now governor of Mozambique) moved up the Shire valley. Between them, these two expeditions made over 20 treaties with chiefs in what is now Malawi. Serpa Pinto met Johnston in August 1889 east of the Ruo, when Johnston advised him not to cross the river into the Shire Highlands. Although Serpa Pinto had previously acted with caution, he crossed the Ruo to Chiromo, now in Malawi in September 1889.
The incursion led to an armed conflict between Portuguese troops led by Serpa Pinto and the Makololo on 8 November 1889 near the Shire river.
Following this minor clash, Johnston's vice-consul, John Buchanan, accused Portugal of ignoring British interests in this area and declared a British protectorate over the Shire Highlands in December 1889 despite contrary instructions. Shortly afterward, Johnston himself declared a further protectorate over the area to the west of Lake Nyasa (also contrary to his instructions) although both protectorates were later endorsed by the Foreign Office.
The actions formed the background to an Anglo-Portuguese crisis in which a British refusal of arbitration was followed by the 1890 British Ultimatum.
The ultimatum was a memorandum sent to the Portuguese Government by Lord Salisbury on 11 January 1890 in which he demanded the withdrawal of the Portuguese troops from Mashonaland and Matabeleland (now Zimbabwe) and the Shire-Nyasa region (now Malawi), where Portuguese and British interests in Africa overlapped. It meant that the UK was now claiming sovereignty over territories, some of which had been claimed as Portuguese for centuries.
What Her Majesty's Government require and insist upon is the following: that telegraphic instructions shall be sent to the governor of Mozambique at once to the effect that all and any Portuguese military forces which are actually on the Shire or in the Makololo or in the Mashona territory are to be withdrawn. Her Majesty's Government considers that without this the assurances given by the Portuguese Government are illusory.
Mr. Petre is compelled by his instruction to leave Lisbon at once with all the members of his legation unless a satisfactory answer to this foregoing intimation is received by him in, the course of this evening, and Her Majesty's ship Enchantress is now at Vigo waiting for his orders.
The Mr. Petre mentioned was the British Minister in Lisbon.
Aftermath.
Although the ultimatum required Portugal to cease from its activities in the disputed areas, there was no similar restriction on further British efforts to establish occupation there. Agents for Rhodes were active in Mashonaland and Manicaland and in what is now eastern Zambia, and John Buchanan asserted British rule in more of the Shire Highlands. There were armed clashes between Portuguese troops who were already in occupation in Manicaland and Rhodes’ incoming men in 1890 and 1891, which ceased only when some areas that had been allocated to Portugal in the unratified 1890 treaty were reassigned to Rhodes’ British South Africa Company in the 1891 treaty, with Portugal being given more land in the Zambezi valley in compensation for this loss.
The seeming ease by which the Portuguese government had acquiesced to the British demands was seen as a national humiliation by many in Portugal, including republican opponents of Portugal's monarchy. Portuguese anger over the ultimatum led to the fall of Prime Minister José Luciano de Castro's administration and its replacement by a new administration led by António de Serpa Pimentel. Combined with a variety of other factors, such as the Portuguese royal family's expenses, the Lisbon Regicide, political instability and changing religious and social views in Portugal led to the 5 October 1910 revolution, which overthrew the Portuguese monarchy. The reason that Lord Salisbury and his diplomatically isolated British government used tactics that could have led to war has been plausibly argued as the result of fear of Portuguese occupation of Manicaland and the Shire Highlands, which would have forestalled British interests.
In an attempt to reach an agreement over Portuguese African borders, the Treaty of London defining the territorial limits of Angola and Mozambique, was signed on 20 August 1890 by Portugal and the United Kingdom. The treaty was published in the "Diário do Governo" (Portugal's "Government Daily") on 30 August and presented to the parliament that same day, leading to a new wave of protests and the downfall of the Portuguese government. Not only was it never ratified by the Portuguese Parliament; but Cecil Rhodes, whose plans of expansion it affected, also opposed this treaty. A new treaty was negotiated which gave Portugal more territory in the Zambezi valley than the 1890 treaty, but what is now the Manicaland Province of Zimbabwe passed from Portuguese to British control. This treaty was signed in Lisbon on 11 June 1891, and in addition to defining boundaries, it allowed freedom of navigation on the Zambezi and Shire rivers and allowed the UK to lease land for a port at Chinde at the mouth of the Zambezi.
The 1890 ultimatum soured Anglo-Portuguese relations for some time, although when in the late 1890s Portugal underwent a severe economic crisis, its government sought a British loan. However, with the outbreak of the Boer war, Britain sought support from Portugal and signed an Anglo-Portuguese Declaration on 14 October 1899. This new treaty reaffirmed former treaties of Alliance and committed Britain to defending Portuguese colonies from possible enemies. In return, Portugal agreed to stop arms being supplied to the Transvaal through Lourenço Marques and declared its neutrality in the conflict.
Although official relations were repaired, the 1890 ultimatum was said to be one of the main causes of the failed 31 January 1891 revolt by republicans in Porto and, eventually, the successful 5 October 1910 revolution, which ended the monarchy in Portugal 20 years later, around three years after the assassination of the Portuguese king (Carlos I of Portugal) and the crown prince on 1 February 1908.

William Emerson Ritter

William Emerson Ritter (November 21, 1856 – January 10, 1944) was an American biologist. 
Ritter initiated and shaped the Marine Biological Association of San Diego (now Scripps Institution of Oceanography of UC San Diego) and the American Society for the Dissemination of Science (now the Society for Science and the Public and Science News). Innovative and entrepreneurial, with a deep desire for human service, he worked tirelessly to educate people in scientific thinking. He was the first biologist to propose a theory of systems, and seems to be the originator of the term organicism for biological purposes.
Early life.
William Emerson Ritter was born on a farm on November 21, 1856, in Hampden Township, Columbia County, Wisconsin. His parents, Horatio and Leonora Ritter, moved from New York a few years earlier. The Ritter household included William, his brother Frank, his sisters Mary, Ella, and Flora, and his maternal grandparents, Nathan and Ruby Eason. For the first few years of his life his paternal grandparents, Ezra and Mary Ritter, were also living in the area. The family worked hard on the farm, cultivating corn, wheat, potatoes, apples, and other crops.
Early correspondence shows that he always liked school, and was always seeking meaning—seeking to do something with his life. In 1876, he had the chance to attend high school in Columbus, Wisconsin, which had opened that year. Like many youth, he struggled with what to do with his life. After attending a year of high school, he began to teach at a Hampden school, while continuing his studies. In 1879, he attended college at the Oshkosh Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh). He left there after only one year due to financial reasons, and took a job teaching in Columbus, Wisconsin. He hoped to earn enough money to go back to college.
In 1881, he took a job as a teacher in Oconto, Wisconsin. There, he continued to read voraciously, and had a particular attraction for science. It was here that he started to develop a passion for helping people understand science. He believed that science was the key to the future of society, and that if people could be taught to think with the reasoned, thoughtful, unbiased critical perspective of science, that much suffering in the world could be alleviated.
Education and early professional years.
Ritter went back to college in Oshkosh. While he was there, he read a geology textbook by Joseph LeConte, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Ritter was so impressed by the book, and its thoughtful, unbiased perspectives, that he made the decision to go to the University of California and study with Joseph LeConte. He graduated with a teaching certificate from Oshkosh in 1884, and then moved to California to finish his BA at the university.
Ritter needed to earn money for school, and so became a schoolteacher and tutor to pay for his tuition. After a few years of alternately taking classes and teaching to earn money, he graduated with his BA in 1888. The next year he received a scholarship to go to Harvard University for his MA and Ph.D. in zoology.
He spent a few summers at Marine Laboratories, and in 1891 was given a job teaching biology at the University of California in Berkeley.
Joseph LeConte was the chair of all the scientific fields at the university. In the fall of 1891, following the growing trend of science specialization, the science department was divided into four departments, and Ritter was appointed the chair of the new zoology department.
It was also in 1891 that he married a Berkeley physician, Mary Bennett. The couple honeymooned at the Hotel del Coronado near San Diego; they spent part of their time on marine research, collecting blind goby fish in the ocean near Point Loma. In San Diego he met a local physician and naturalist, Dr. Fred Baker, who would later encourage him to build a marine biological laboratory in San Diego.
Ritter was chosen to be among the elite scientists of the 1899 Harriman Alaska Expedition. Chosen for his knowledge of marine biology in general and marine invertebrates in particular, he accompanied the group of scientists on their exploration of Alaska.
Searching for a place for a California Marine Laboratory.
Ritter, like many of his contemporaries, believed it was important to study living things in their natural environment rather than isolate them in laboratory conditions. He was familiar with the work being done at field research stations like the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole (1888), the Hopkins Marine Laboratory (1892), and the Puget Sound Biological Station, later known as the Friday Harbor Laboratories (1903).
Ritter wanted to set up a permanent laboratory to study the biology along the Pacific coast. Between 1892 and 1902, he and his colleagues set up temporary research sites at Pacific Grove, Avalon Bay, and San Pedro Harbor. His goal was frustrated by lack of money and lack of an appropriate site.
In 1903, Ritter was introduced to newspaper magnate E.W. Scripps who, together with his half-sister, Ellen Browning Scripps, agreed to fund his work in San Diego. In early 1903, Ritter established a biological laboratory in the Hotel del Coronado's boathouse at Glorietta Bight. At the end of the year, the Marine Biological Association of San Diego was founded with Ritter as scientific director.
In 1905, the laboratory moved from Coronado to La Jolla where Ritter secured a lease of land in La Jolla Park, just above The Cove. Architects William S. Hebbard and Irving J. Gill built what was known as the "little green laboratory at the Cove."
Two years later, the Biological Association purchased a site at La Jolla Shores which would provide space for future expansion and isolation from the inevitable growth of La Jolla. Ellen Browning Scripps gave a substantial endowment that made possible the construction of the George H. Scripps Laboratory (1910). 
In 1912, the Biological Association became a department within the University of California and was renamed The Scripps Institution for Biological Research, later the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Donations by Ellen Browning Scripps made possible the construction of a pier, a public aquarium, and a library-museum building. She also paid for the construction of a director's residence and cottages for staff and their families.
The Ritter-Scripps Partnership.
Ritter and E.W. Scripps became good friends as well as business partners. It seemed to be an odd couple, as Ritter was kind, quiet, and scholarly, and Scripps was opinionated and boisterous, a self-described "damned old crank." Scripps, however, continued to push Ritter to make biology more practical. They came to believe that since people were biological animals, then biology ought to have some insights into human behavior and human motivation.
After World War I, Scripps and Ritter became convinced that nations needed a forum to rationally work out their differences, rather than going to war. They became great advocates for the League of Nations, believing it could be an alternative to war.
Both Ritter and Scripps believed that science had become too parochial. Many scientists had no desire to solve human problems or even share their insights with the laity. Many scientists felt that sharing their scientific discoveries with the popular media would somehow soil their pure discovery. Ritter and Scripps, on the other hand, believed that it was critical to share these scientific discoveries, and by doing so, would help people to "think like a scientist"—with a reasoned thoughtfulness. By the end of 1920, Ritter and Scripps had come to the conclusion that a newspaper would be the best avenue for sharing these scientific discoveries. With Scripps funding, and Ritter as the scientific director, they started the Science Service in Washington DC, using a newspaper format (now Science News) to share science information and discoveries.
Organicism.
One of the great biological controversies of the day was "what is life?" One school of thought was mechanism, which believed that there is no essential difference between a rock and a human life—it's simply a matter of the chemistry involved. If all the chemical reactions were known, we would understand what makes life. The mechanists were fond of saying things like, "the brain secretes thoughts in the same way that the kidneys secrete urine."
On the other hand, the school of thought called vitalism said that there was something different in life than in non-life. There was a vital force—a spiritual force—that made life. Rocks did not have the vital force. Humans did. The vitalists and the mechanists entered endless debates and wrote endless papers advocating their perspective.
According to Ernst Mayr, Ritter introduced the third school of thought: organicism. While the term "organicism" had been used before, Ritter was the first to use it for biological purposes and to create a theory of it. Organicism believed that life was interrelationships between living things, living in a complex web. Today, organicism might be called systems theory. In 1918, Ritter wrote his organicist tome, "The Unity of the Organism", which he believed was his magnum opus.
Later years.
He continued his study and science advocacy into his later years. He continued to explore the question that E.W. Scripps gave to him, "What is this damned human animal, anyway?" He continued to explore human nature, from a philosophically zoological point of view.
The University of California awarded him the Doctor of Laws degree in 1933. He continued to be a tireless advocate of evolution, science education, and human service. He continued to write, finishing his last published book, "The California Woodpecker and I", at the age of 81. At the time of his death, on January 10, 1944, he had 5 book-length unpublished manuscripts written, and parts of many other books and articles. His literary executor, Edna Bailey, consolidated his manuscripts and published sections of them, posthumously, under the title "Charles Darwin and the Golden Rule".

Edward Sedgwick

Edward Sedgwick, Jr. (November 7, 1889 – May 7, 1953) was an American film director, writer, actor and producer.
Early life.
He was born in Galveston, Texas, the son of Edward Sedgwick, Sr. and Josephine Walker, both stage actors. At the age of four, young Edward Sedgwick joined his show business family in what was then the Sedgwick Comedy Company, a vaudeville act, doing a "singing speciality". He played child parts and did vaudeville acts until he was seven, when he was given his first comedy part, that of an Irish immigrant, in a comedy written by his father called "Just Over".
During this time, he was only on stage during the summer months. In winter his father took him back to Galveston and sent him to school. He graduated from St. Mary's University of Galveston, and was then sent to the Peacock Military Academy in San Antonio, from which he graduated with the rank of first lieutenant. After graduation, he seriously contemplated a military life but the lure of the stage proved stronger and so he rejoined his father's company, now known as "The Five Sedgwicks." The troupe consisted of his parents, himself and his two sisters. Forced to close the act due to his father's illness, Sedgwick went into musical comedy and soon had a company of his own, known as "The Cabaret Girls," produced, directed and managed by himself. The company was very successful, and it was only after repeated offers from Romaine Fielding that he was induced, at the end of his third successful season, to disband his company and become a film-actor.
The two other family members were Edward's twin sisters Eileen and Josie, who both later pursued successful silent-movie acting careers. Sedgwick broke into films as a comedian in 1915, frequently cast as a zany baseball player. He then became a serial director six years later in 1921, and moved on to the Tom Mix western unit. Sedgwick's love of baseball came in handy for the ballpark sequences of Mix's "Stepping Out", Buck Jones’ "Hit and Run", William Haines’ "Slide, Kelly, Slide", Buster Keaton’s "The Cameraman", and Robert Young’s "Death on the Diamond".
Career.
Sedgwick signed with MGM in 1926. When Buster Keaton joined the company in 1928, Sedgwick found a kindred spirit and a fellow baseball enthusiast. Sedgwick (known informally as "Ed" or "Junior") directed all but one of Keaton's MGM features: "The Cameraman", "Spite Marriage", "Free and Easy", "Doughboys" (in which Sedgwick appears on screen as a dumb soldier), "Parlor, Bedroom and Bath", "Speak Easily", and "What! No Beer?". In 1936 Sedgwick briefly became a producer-director at Hal Roach Studios. There, he made "Mr. Cinderella" and "Pick a Star", both starring Jack Haley; "Pick a Star" featured a guest appearance by Laurel and Hardy. Between 1938 and 1940 Sedgwick directed Joe E. Brown (another baseball buddy) in five comedy features.
Sedgwick had proven himself as a capable director of offbeat subjects (including a few murder mysteries). This earned him an assignment to direct "Eyes in the Night" (1942), which featured the novel characterization of a genial private detective -- who is blind. Producer Jack Chertok, judging Sedgwick's approach too breezy, replaced Sedgwick with promising short-subject director Fred Zinnemann. Sedgwick was reassigned to a more suitable project, the Laurel and Hardy comedy "Air Raid Wardens". It was his last assignment for three years, but he remained on the MGM payroll, sharing an office with the almost-as-idle Buster Keaton.
Lucille Ball, under contract to MGM, spent much of her free time with Sedgwick and Keaton. When the studio remade its 1936 hit "Libeled Lady" (as "Easy to Wed", 1946), Ball was one of the stars, and she recruited Sedgwick and Keaton to stage a physical-comedy sequence involving duck hunting. 
Sedgwick next worked on the Red Skelton comedy "A Southern Yankee" (1948). Two modern sources differ on Sedgwick's participation. Author Michael Zmuda has revealed that S. Sylvan Simon directed the film in its entirety, despite Sedgwick's screen credit. A more recent source confirms Zmuda's discovery but adds more context. According to Keaton biographer James Curtis, Simon had indeed filmed "A Southern Yankee" in its entirety, but it previewed so poorly that producer Paul Jones asked Buster Keaton and Edward Sedgwick to add new gags, and writer Nat Perrin to insert their material into a revised script. Between them they fashioned 40 pages of sight gags, including a horse-and-buggy chase and a Civil War skirmish (which Red Skelton halts by carrying both Union and Confederate flags). Sedgwick directed the retakes, which saved the film, and received sole credit as director.
In September 1950 Sedgwick and Keaton worked on the Red Skelton comedy "Excuse My Dust" (released 1951), assisting director Roy Rowland. It was their final project for MGM; dozens of longtime employees, including Sedgwick and Keaton, were released by the studio as an economy measure in 1950. Sedgwick's final released film was Universal's "Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm" (filmed 1952, released 1953), featuring a Keatonesque railroad chase.
New opportunity.
In 1952 Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, then enjoying enormous popularity in their "I Love Lucy" television series, pursued the idea of compiling a few first-season episodes into a full-length feature film. Ball asked her old friend Ed Sedgwick to direct new scenes connecting the footage already prepared for television. Sedgwick was careful to make the new scenes match the old ones and turned in an efficient job. Ball and Arnaz named him a senior officer in their new Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Film Company. 
The completed feature was previewed successfully in a Bakersfield, California theater. Ball and Arnaz were set to release the film through United Artists until MGM intervened -- the studio had already signed Ball and Arnaz for a new feature film, and didn't want the "I Love Lucy" film to blunt the MGM film's potential appeal. Ball and Arnaz reluctantly shelved their own film, and Edward Sedgwick's final picture went unreleased. Decades later it was rediscovered, and released to home video in 2010 under the title "".
Death.
On May 7, 1953, Edward Sedgwick died of a heart attack in Los Angeles, California at the age of 63. He is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City.
Rediscovered film.
Sedgwick's 1923 silent film "The First Degree" was long thought to have been a lost film until a complete copy was discovered at the Chicago Film Archives, part of a collection of agricultural films donated from Peoria, IL. Chicago Film Archives has preserved and digitally transferred the film.

Mark Davis (English cricketer)

Mark Richard Davis (born 26 February 1962 in Kilve, Somerset) is a former professional cricketer, who represented Somerset County Cricket Club in 77 first-class matches and 59 List A matches between 1982 and 1987. A left arm fast-medium bowler and left-handed batsmen, his ability was brought to the attention of Somerset after winning a competition set-up by the Somerset County Gazette to find a fast bowler. Before making his full debut for Somerset he represented Wiltshire, a minor county side. During his career he took 149 first-class wickets at an average of 35.62 and a best performance of 7 for 55. He averaged 14.60 with the bat with a solitary first-class fifty, 60 not out.
After retiring in 1989 he became a builder for a short period before training to become a cricket coach. In 1996 he joined Millfield School and has remained as the head coach there working alongside Richard Ellison. Recently he has joined the cricket commentary team on BBC Radio Bristol and works as the on-air analyst.

York Street Historic District

The York Street Historic District in Newport, Kentucky was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 26, 1995. Most of the buildings were built in the mid and late Victorian era. The district is bounded by Seventh Street on the north and Tenth Street on the south.
The York Street Historic District, while smaller than East Row Historic District, contains a variety of interesting buildings and businesses, including some beautiful churches.
The Salem United Methodist Church (now The Stained Glass Theatre), is at Eight and York. It was built in 1882 and designed by Samuel Hannaford. In 1986 Newport's Salem United Methodist Church was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. On March 10 it was damaged by a tornado. Damage estimates at the time were $210,000. The church congregation capped the steeple, repaired the holes and removed the debris, but due to a decrease in membership and a great deal left to repair, they felt it would be best to merge with another Methodist congregation, and put the church up for sale.
Other churches in the district include the First Baptist Church at 8th and York Streets and the former York Street Congregational Church.
The York Street International Café (Eighth and York streets) displays the original stained glass sign from its historic use as a drugstore.

Virginia State Route 99

State Route 99 (SR 99) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs from the north town limit of Pulaski east to SR F-047 just east of Interstate 81 (I-81) and SR 100 at McAdam.
Route description.
SR 99 begins at the north town limit of Pulaski. The highway continues north into unincorporated Pulaski County as SR 738 (Robinson Tract Road). SR 99 heads south as two-lane undivided Randolph Avenue. At the west edge of downtown, SR 99 splits into a one-way pair. Westbound SR 99 turns onto Randolph Avenue from 3rd Street while eastbound SR 99 turns from Randolph Avenue onto Main Street, which parallels Peak Creek through downtown. Each direction of SR 99 follows two-way streets east to Jefferson Avenue, where both Main and 3rd become one-way. One block to the east, SR 99 intersects U.S. Route 11 (Washington Avenue). Two blocks east of US 11, Main Street becomes a four-lane divided highway as the two directions of the state highway come together. SR 99 gains a median west of Bob White Boulevard, where the highway reduces to two lanes, begins to curve to the south, and crosses Norfolk Southern Railway's Pulaski District and Peak Creek. At the east town limit of Pulaski, the state highway becomes Count Pulaski Drive, which expands to a four-lane divided highway shortly before reaching its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-81 and SR 100 and, just to the south, its eastern terminus at SR F-047 (Kirby Road) in the hamlet of McAdam.
History.
SR 99 east of downtown Pulaski was initially part of State Route 10, supplemented with U.S. Route 11 in 1926. In the early 1930s, US 11 was rerouted along its current route south of Pulaski, but SR 10 remained. The road from Pulaski northwest for 6.20 miles (9.98 km) was added to the state highway system in 1932 as State Route 228. In the 1933 renumbering, SR 228, as well as SR 212 north of McAdam, became State Route 99. (The rest of SR 212 became State Route 100.) The rest of the road to the Bland County line was added in 1936, and in 1937 it was completed to SR 42 at Mechanicsburg. In 1952, the state decided to transfer the whole road northwest of Pulaski to the secondary system "when present primary funds set up for its improvement are expended"; the former SR 99 became State Route 738 then.

Sousaki volcano

Sousaki (; ) is a dormant volcano and modern solfatara field in northeastern Corinthia, Greece, at the northwest end of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc.
The volcano was active during the Pliocene and early Quaternary periods of the Earth's geological history. There is still significant solfataric activity at this location. The volcano erupted dacite lava. The geothermal system releases about 1 megagram per day of gases at 42 °C, 90% CO2 and &lt; 1% each of CH4 and H2S. The earthquakes of 1997 of 3-4 R had as a result the uprising magma in higher areas of the earth crust. So future activities are possible. 
The last eruption of this volcano was a side eruption which created new land in the Gulf of Megara, where there are major port and refinery facilities.

Microsoft at Work

Microsoft at Work (MaW) was a short-lived effort promoted by Microsoft to tie together common business machinery, like fax machines and photocopiers, with a common communications protocol allowing control and status information to be shared with computers running Microsoft Windows. Similar efforts for other markets included Microsoft at Home and Cablesoft. By any measure these efforts were a dismal failure; it appears only a small number of devices using Microsoft at Work were ever released before disappearing without a trace. Microsoft has since re-used the "at Work" term for a section of their web site describing various tips and tricks for using Windows in a business environment.
Microsoft first presented the at Work concept at a release party on 9 June 1993. They described five classes of devices as being targets for the at Work system; fax machines, photocopiers, telephones, printers, and hand-held PDAs (personal digital assistants). The idea of at Work was to design a standard set of communications protocols, status codes and commands to allow the devices to be remotely operated in the same fashion as network printers under PostScript.
The system consisted of five primary components;
Microsoft claimed that supporting at Work would add only a few dollars to a device supporting it, making it attractive for office equipment which would normally cost several hundreds of dollars. They also claimed to have signed up fifty partners who were developing at Work devices for release starting at the end of 1993. Ricoh demonstrated a fax machine with at Work at the release.
It was not until May 1994 that the first at Work device actually shipped, a Lexmark printer, the WinWriter 600. By 1995 few, if any, additional devices had been added to the list, and the entire concept had essentially disappeared from view. Byte Magazine awarded it a "Whatever Happened To..." in July, noting that "few" products had come to market supporting the standard, and that the original at Work group had been broken up and sent to different divisions within the company. Microsoft continued to claim that it was still being developed, but it seems that by 1995 the effort was dead.
One of the few pieces of software to support at Work was a Microsoft Outlook fax engine, Microsoft Fax (or "Microsoft At Work Fax"), which shipped with Windows 95 but stopped working under more recent versions of the OS.
Although at Work eventually failed, its announcement caused other companies to offer competing systems of their own. Perhaps the best known was Novell's Novell Embedded Systems Technology (NEST), which was released in 1994. Like at Work, NEST eventually disappeared, but was somewhat more successful and lived on in a number of products.

Pink Map

The Pink Map (), also known as the Rose-Coloured Map, was a map prepared in 1885 to represent the Kingdom of Portugal's claim of sovereignty over a land corridor connecting the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique during the Scramble for Africa. The area claimed included most of modern-day Zimbabwe and large parts of modern-day Zambia and Malawi. 
In the first half of the 19th century, Portugal held total control over only a small number of coastal settlements in Angola and Mozambique. The Portuguese also claimed suzerainty over other "de facto" independent towns and nominal Portuguese subjects in the Zambezi valley, but could rarely enforce its claims; most of the territory now within Angola and Mozambique was entirely independent of Portugal's control. Between 1840 and 1869, Portugal expanded the area it controlled but felt threatened by the activities of other European colonial powers in the region.
The United Kingdom refused to acknowledge Portugal's claims in Africa which were not based on effective occupation, including a Portuguese offer in 1889 to abandon their claim to a transcontinental link in exchange for British recognition of other claims. The 1890 British Ultimatum ended Portuguese claims based on the discovery doctrine and recent exploration. The dispute seriously damaged the prestige of Portugal's monarchy among the Portuguese public, which rapidly turned to republicanism.
Portuguese possessions 1800–1870.
In Angola.
At the start of the 19th century, effective Portuguese governance in Africa south of the equator was limited. Portuguese Angola consisted of areas around Luanda and Benguela, and a few almost independent towns over which Portugal claimed suzerainty, the most northerly being Ambriz. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Angola's main function within the Portuguese Empire was supplying Brazil with slaves. This was facilitated first by the development of coffee plantations in southern Brazil from the 1790s onward, and second by the 1815 and 1817 agreements between the United Kingdom and Portugal limiting—at least on paper—Portuguese slave trading to areas south of the equator. This trade diminished after Brazilian independence in 1822 and more sharply following an 1830 agreement between Britain and Brazil by which the Brazilian government prohibited further imports of slaves. To find people for export as slaves from Angolan towns, Afro-Portuguese traders penetrated as far inland as Katanga and Kazembe, but otherwise few Portuguese moved inland and they did not attempt to establish control there. When the Brazilian slave trade declined, the Portuguese began using slaves for agricultural work on plantations stretching inland from Luanda along the Cuanza River, and to a lesser extent around Benguela. After the Portuguese founded Moçâmedes, south of Benguela, in 1840 and occupied Ambriz in 1855, Portugal controlled a continuous coastal strip from Ambriz to Moçâmedes, but little inland territory. Although Portugal claimed the Congo River estuary, Britain at best accepted limited Portuguese trading rights in the Cabinda enclave north of the river, although these rights did not make Cabinda Portuguese territory.
In Mozambique.
Portugal had occupied parts of the Mozambique coast since the 16th century, but at the start of the 19th century Portuguese presence was limited to Mozambique Island, Ibo and Quelimane in northern Mozambique, outposts at Sena and Tete in the Zambezi valley, Sofala to the south of the Zambezi, and the port town Inhambane further south. Although Delagoa Bay was regarded as Portuguese territory, Lourenço Marques was not settled until 1781, and was temporarily abandoned after a 1796 French raid. In the late 18th century most of the people exported as slaves through Portuguese settlements in Mozambique were sent to Mauritius and Réunion, at that time both French colonies, but the Napoleonic Wars disrupted this trade, and by the early 19th century the Portuguese sent Mozambican slaves to Brazil. As was the case with Angola, slave exports declined after 1830 and were partly replaced by exports of ivory through Lourenço Marques from the 1840s onward.
The nadir of Portuguese fortunes in Mozambique came in the 1830s and 1840s when Lourenço Marques was sacked in 1833 and Sofala in 1835. Zumbo was abandoned in 1836 and the Gaza Empire forced Afro-Portuguese settlers near Vila de Sena to pay tribute. Although Portugal claimed sovereignty over Angoche and a number of smaller Muslim coastal towns, these were virtually independent at the start of the 19th century. However, after Portugal renounced the slave trade, these towns continued the practice. Fearing British or French anti-slavery interventions, Portugal began bringing these towns under stricter control. Angoche resisted and fought off a Portuguese warship attempting to prevent slave trading in 1847. It took another military expedition and occupation in 1860–1 to end Angoche's slave trade. 
Portugal also initiated the Prazo system of large leased estates under nominal Portuguese rule in the Zambezi valley. By the end of the 18th century, the valleys of the Zambezi and lower Shire River were controlled by a few families who claimed to be Portuguese subjects but who were virtually independent. However, starting in 1840 the Portuguese government embarked on a series of military campaigns in an attempt to bring the prazos under its control. Portuguese troops suffered several major setbacks before forcing the last prazo to submit in 1869.
In other inland areas, there was not even the pretence of Portuguese control. In the interior of what is today southern and central Mozambique, Nguni people who had entered the area from South Africa under their leader Soshangane created the Gaza Empire in the 1830s and, up to Soshangane's death in 1856, dominated southern Mozambique outside the two towns of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques. Lourenço Marques only remained in Portuguese hands in the 1840s and early 1850s because the Swazi people vied with Gaza for its control. After Soshangane's death two of his sons struggled for succession, with the eventual winner Mzila coming to power with Portuguese help in 1861. Under Mzila the centre of Gaza power moved north to central Mozambique and came into conflict with the prazo owners who were expanding south from the Zambezi valley.
As in Angola, during the 18th century Afro-Portuguese traders employed by the Mozambican prazo owners penetrated inland from the Zambezi valley as far as Kazembe in search of ivory and copper. In 1798 Francisco de Lacerda, a Portuguese officer based in Mozambique, organised an expedition from Tete to the interior hoping to reach Kazembe, but he died en route in what is now Zambia. Antonio Gamitto tried to establish commercial relations with Kazembe peoples in the upper Zambezi valley in 1831 also without success. Apart from Lacerda's expedition, none of the trading ventures into the interior from Angola or Mozambique had official status and were not attempts to bring the area between Angola and Mozambique under Portuguese control. Even Lacerda's expedition was largely commercial in purpose, although it was later declared by the Lisbon Geographical Society to have established claim to the area it covered.
Elsewhere.
After Brazilian independence and the loss of most Asian territories, Portuguese colonial expansion focused on Africa. In the late 1860s Lisbon had no effective presence in the area between Angola and Mozambique, and little presence in many areas lying within the present-day borders of those countries. By the second half of the 19th century, various European powers developed an increasing interest in Africa. The first challenge to Portugal's territorial claims came from the area around Delagoa Bay. The Boers who founded the South African Republic were concerned British occupation of the bay would threaten their independence, and to prevent this they claimed their own outlet to the Indian Ocean at Delagoa Bay in 1868. Although Portugal and the Transvaal reached agreement in 1869 on a border under which all of Delagoa Bay remained Portuguese, Britain then lodged a claim to the bay's southern part. This claim was rejected in 1875 after arbitration by French President MacMahon, which upheld the 1869 borders.
A further significant issue arose in the areas south and west of Lake Nyasa (now also known as Lake Malawi), which David Livingstone reached in the 1850s. In the 1860s and 1870s Anglicans and Presbyterians established several missions in the Shire Highlands, including a mission and small trading settlement founded at Blantyre in 1876. In 1878 businessmen linked to the Presbyterian missions established the African Lakes Company, which aimed to set up a trading venture that would work in close co-operation with the missions to combat the slave trade by introducing legitimate trade and to develop European influence in the area. Later, another challenge came from the foundation of a German colony at Angra Pequena (present-day Lüderitz) in Namibia in 1883. Although there was no Portuguese presence this far south Portugal claimed the Namibian coast, being the first European nation to have visited it.
Portuguese exploration and early negotiation attempts.
Though the Lacerda and Gamitto expeditions were largely commercial, the third quarter of the nineteenth century saw scientific African expeditions. The Portuguese government was suspicious of exploration by other European nations, particularly those whose leasers held an official (often consular) position as Livingstone had, which their home countries could use to claim territory Portugal regarded as its own. To prevent this the Lisbon Geographical Society and the Geographical Commission of the Portuguese Ministry of Marine—at that time responsible for overseas territories as well as the navy—created a joint commission in 1875 to plan scientific expeditions to the area between Angola and Mozambique.
Although Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrade Corvo doubted Portugal's ability to achieve coast-to-coast empire, he sanctioned expeditions. Portuguese soldier and explorer Alexandre de Serpa Pinto led three such expeditions through which Portugal could attempt to assert its African territorial claims. The first was from Mozambique to the eastern Zambezi in 1869, the second to the Congo River and upper Zambezi from Angola in 1876, and the last in 1877–79 crossing Africa from Angola with the intention of claiming the area between Angola and Mozambique. In 1877 Portuguese explorers Hermenegildo Capelo and Roberto Ivens led an expedition from Luanda towards the Congo basin. Capelo made a second journey from Angola to Mozambique, largely following existing trade routes, in 1884–85.
During and after the Serpa Pinto and Capelo expeditions, the Portuguese government attempted bilateral negotiations with Britain. In 1879 as part of talks on a treaty on the freedom of navigation on the Congo and Zambezi rivers and the development of trade in those river basins, Portugal formally claimed the area south and east of the Ruo River (the present southeastern border of Malawi). The 1879 treaty was never ratified, and in 1882 Portugal occupied the lower Shire River valley as far as the Ruo, after which its government again asked Britain to accept this territorial claim, without success. Further bilateral negotiations led to a draft treaty in February 1884, which would have included British recognition of Portuguese sovereignty over the mouth of the Congo in exchange for freedom of navigation on the Congo and Zambezi rivers, but the Berlin Conference of 1884–85 ended these discussions which could have led to British recognition of Portuguese influence stretching across the continent. Portugal's efforts to establish a corridor of influence between Angola and Mozambique without gaining full political control were hampered by one of the articles in the General Act of the Berlin Conference requiring effective occupation of areas claimed rather than relying on historical claims based on early discovery or more recent claims based largely on exploration, as Portugal wished to use.
To validate Portuguese claims, Serpa Pinto was appointed as Portuguese consul in Zanzibar in 1884 with the mission of exploring the region between Lake Nyasa and the coast from the Zambezi to the Ruvuma River and securing the allegiance of chiefs in that area. His expedition reached Lake Nyasa and the Shire Highlands but failed to make treaties of protection with chiefs in territories west of the lake. At the northwest end of Lake Nyasa around Karonga the African Lakes Company made, or claimed to have made, treaties with local chiefs between 1884 and 1886. Its ambition was to become a chartered company and control the route from the lake along the Shire River. Its further ambition to control the Shire Highlands was given up in 1886 following protests from local missionaries that it could not police this area effectively.
The Berlin Conference.
The General Act of the Berlin Conference dated 26 February 1885 introduced the principle of effective occupation, potentially damaging Portuguese claims, particularly in Mozambique where other powers were active. Article 34 required a nation acquiring land on the coasts of Africa outside of its previous possessions to notify the other signatories of the Act so they could protest such claims. Article 35 of the Act provided that rights could only be acquired over previously uncolonised lands if the power claiming them had established sufficient authority there to protect existing rights and free trade. This implied making treaties with local rulers, establishing colonial administration, and exercising police powers. Initially Portugal claimed the Berlin Treaty did not apply to its territories and that Portugal was not required to issue notifications or establish effective occupation, as Portugal's claim to the Mozambique coast had existed unchallenged for centuries.
British officials did not accept this interpretation and in January 1884 Henry E. O'Neill, the British consul based at Mozambique Island, stated:
To speak of Portuguese colonies in East Africa is to speak of a mere fiction—a fiction colourably sustained by a few scattered seaboard settlements, beyond whose narrow littoral and local limits colonisation and government have no existence."
To forestall British designs on Mozambique and the interior that O'Neill claimed Portugal did not occupy, Portugal in 1884 commissioned its soldier Joaquim Carlos Paiva de Andrada to establish effective occupation. He was active in four areas: first, in 1884 he established the town of Beira and occupied Sofala Province. Also in 1884, he acquired a concession of an area within a radius of Zumbo, west of where Afro-Portuguese families had traded and settled since the 1860s. Andrada only established colonial administration in 1889, when he founded an outpost beyond the confluence of the Zambezi and Kafue rivers and an administrative district based at Zumbo . In 1889 Andrada was granted another concession over Manica, covering today's Manica Province of Mozambique and Manicaland Province of Zimbabwe. Andrada obtained treaties over much of this area and established a rudimentary administration before he was arrested and expelled in November 1890 by the British South Africa Police (BSAP). Finally, in 1889 Andrada crossed northern Mashonaland (present-day Zimbabwe's Mashonaland Central Province) to obtain treaties. He failed to inform the Portuguese government of these treaties, so other powers were not formally notified of the claims as the Berlin Treaty required.
The Pink Map.
Portuguese transcontinental claims.
Despite the outcome of the Berlin Conference and failed bilateral negotiations with Britain, Portugal continued pursuing a contiguous, transcontinental colonial territory. In 1885 the Portuguese Foreign Minister Barros Gomes published the so-called Pink or Rose-Coloured Map, a map representing a formal Portuguese claim to sovereignty over an area stretching from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Portugal attempted to solidify the claim by signing treaties with France and Germany in 1886. To obtain the French treaty, Portugal relinquished its claim to the area around the Casamance River in Guinea in exchange for vague recognition of the Portuguese claim to an undefined area between Angola and Mozambique, with the Rose-Coloured Map attached to the treaty for information. To obtain a similar treaty with Germany, Portugal agreed to a southern boundary for Angola and northern boundary for Mozambique favourable to Germany. France and Germany's "noting" the Portuguese claims did not amount to their accepting the claims, only recognition that Portugal made such claims.
Post–Pink Map negotiation attempts.
British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury formally protested the Rose-Coloured Map, but initially made no claim to the territories it represented. In July 1887 Salisbury stated the British government would not accept any Portuguese claim unless there were sufficient Portuguese forces in the claimed area to maintain order. The Portuguese government thought this meant Britain would accept a claim backed by effective occupation. Later in that year, the British minister in Lisbon proposed the Zambezi as the northern limit of British influence. This would have stranded Scottish missionaries in the Shire Highlands within the Portuguese zone and created a band of Portuguese territory linking Angola and Mozambique, though one significantly smaller than the Rose-Coloured Map proposed, as all of what is now Zimbabwe would be British territory. Portugal rejected the proposal because the Shire Highlands and Scottish missions could only be accessed through Portuguese coastal areas, and because the proposal would involve giving up the southern and more valuable half of the transcontinental zone claimed in the Rose-Coloured Map, apparently for little in return.
By 1889 the Portuguese government felt less confident and its Foreign Minister Barros Gomes informed the British government Portugal was willing to abandon its claim to a zone linking Angola and Mozambique in exchange for recognition of its claim to the Shire Highlands. This time the British government rejected the proposal, partly because of the strong opposition of the Scottish missions, and partly because the Chinde River entrance to the Zambezi was discovered in April 1889. This meant oceangoing ships could now enter the Zambezi and its tributary the Shire River, making them international waterways with access to the Shire Highlands.
British and Portuguese courting of local influence.
Later popular perception in Britain suggested the Rose-Coloured Map was a direct challenge to Cecil Rhodes's vision of a "Cape to Cairo Red Line". The Cape to Cairo idea was first put forward by Henry "Harry" Hamilton Johnston in an August 1888 newspaper article three years after the Pink Map's publication and only later adopted by Rhodes. His British South Africa Company (BSAC) was founded in October 1888 and only received its royal charter enabling it to trade with local rulers; to buy, sell, and own land; and to operate a police force in Matabeleland and adjacent areas south of the Zambezi River in October 1889. From the incorporation of the BSAC, Rhodes and the company opposed Portuguese claims south of the Zambezi, and Rhodes made no secret of his intention to seize part of Mozambique to gain an outlet to the Indian Ocean. North of the Zambezi, Portuguese claims to the Shire Highlands were opposed by the African Lakes Company and the missionaries, the latter supported by public opinion, especially in Scotland. As late as 1888 the British Foreign Office declined protection to the tiny British settlements in the Shire Highlands. It did not accept expansion of Portuguese influence there, and in 1889 it appointed Harry Johnston as British consul to Mozambique and the Interior, instructing him to report on the extent of Portuguese presence in the Zambezi and Shire valleys. He was also to make conditional treaties with local rulers outside Portuguese control. These conditional treaties did not establish a British protectorate, but prevented the rulers from accepting protection from another state.
In 1888 Portuguese government representatives in Mozambique organised two expeditions to make treaties of protection with the Yao chiefs southeast of Lake Nyasa and in the Shire Highlands to establish Portuguese territorial claims. The first expedition under António Cardoso, former governor of Quelimane, set off in November 1888 for Lake Nyasa. The second expedition under Serpa Pinto, now governor of Mozambique, moved up the Shire Valley. The two expeditions resulted in over 20 treaties with chiefs in what is now Malawi. Serpa Pinto's expedition was well armed, partly in response to a Portuguese resident's request for help in resolving disturbances caused by the Makololo chiefs on the lower Shire River. David Livingstone had brought the Makololo into the area during his Zambezi expedition, and they remained on the Shire north and west of the Ruo River when the expedition ended in 1864. The Makololo claimed to be outside Portuguese control, and asked for British assistance to remain independent. Serpa Pinto met with British consul Harry Johnston in August 1889 east of the Ruo, when Johnston advised him not to cross the river into the Shire Highlands.
British settlers living in the Shire Highlands probably encouraged the Makololo to attack Serpa Pinto, resulting in a minor battle between Pinto's Portuguese troops and the Makololo on 8 November 1889 near the Shire River. Although Serpa Pinto had previously acted with caution, he then crossed the Ruo into what is now Malawi. When Pinto occupied much Makololo territory, Johnston's vice-consul John Buchanan accused Portugal of ignoring British interests in this area and declared a British protectorate over the Shire Highlands in December 1889, despite contrary instructions. Shortly after this, Johnston declared a further protectorate over the area to the west of Lake Nyasa, also contrary to his instructions, although both protectorates were later endorsed by the Foreign Office. These actions formed the background to an Anglo-Portuguese crisis in which a British refusal of arbitration was followed by the 1890 British Ultimatum.
Resolution.
1890 ultimatum.
The 1890 British Ultimatum is a memorandum Prime Minister Lord Salisbury sent to the Portuguese government on 11 January 1890 in which he demanded the withdrawal of Portuguese troops from Mashonaland and Matabeleland (now Zimbabwe) and from the area between the Shire River north of the Ruo and Lake Nyasa (including all the Shire Highlands), where Portuguese and British interests overlapped. The ultimatum meant Britain now claimed sovereignty over territories Portugal had claimed for centuries. There was no dispute regarding the borders of Angola, as neither country effectively occupied any part of the sparsely populated border area. Historians have argued that Lord Salisbury's diplomatically isolated government used tactics that could have led to war because they feared humiliation from Portuguese success. King Carlos I of Portugal accepted the ultimatum, causing anti-British demonstrations and riots in Portugal. Portuguese republicans used it as an excuse to attack the government, and staged a failed January 1891 coup d’état in Porto.
Though the ultimatum required Portugal cease activity in the disputed areas, it did not restrict further British occupation there. Between the British issuing the ultimatum and the signing of a treaty in Lisbon on 11 June 1891, both Britain and Portugal tried to occupy more of the disputed areas and assert their authority. Although the Portuguese established rudimentary administration in Manicaland in 1884 and strengthened this in 1889 before there was BSAC presence in the area, in November 1890, BSAP personnel arrested and expelled the Portuguese officials in an attempt to gain access to the coast and there were armed clashes between Rhodes's men and Portuguese troops already in Manicaland. The British government refused to accept existing Portuguese administration; fighting only stopped when Rhodes's company was awarded part of Manicaland. Buchanan further asserted British sovereignty over the Shire Highlands by executing two Afro-Portuguese cipais (soldiers), claiming they were within British jurisdiction.
Bilateral treaty.
The General Act of the Berlin Conference required arbitration of disputes. After the ultimatum Portugal requested arbitration, but because the 1875 Delagoa Bay arbitration had favoured of Portugal, Lord Salisbury refused and demanded a bilateral treaty. Talks started in Lisbon in April 1890, and in May the Portuguese delegation proposed joint administration of the disputed area. The British government refused, drafting a treaty that imposed boundaries generally unfavourable to Portugal. This led to a wave of protests and dissolution of the Portuguese Parliament when the draft treaty was published. This treaty did grant Portugal rights to build a railway, road, and telegraph line along the Zambezi River's north bank, which would have provided a limited link between Angola and Mozambique.
The new Portuguese Parliament refused to ratify the agreement in August 1890, leading to further negotiations. The 1891 draft treaty granted Portugal more territory in the Zambezi Valley than the 1890 treaty, in exchange for Portugal's giving up what is now the Manicaland Province of Zimbabwe. This treaty also set Angola's borders and provided for freedom of navigation on the Zambezi and Shire rivers. Britain and Portugal signed the treaty in Lisbon on 11 June 1891. However, it gave Portugal no special rights along the Zambezi's northern bank, effectively ending Portugal's Pink Map project.

Big Four (banking)

The Big Four (or Big 4) is the colloquial name given to the four main banks in several countries where the banking industry is dominated by just four institutions and where the phrase has thus gained relevance. Some countries include more or fewer institutions in such rankings, leading to other names such as Big Three, Big Five, or Big Six.
International use.
Internationally, the term "Big Four Banks" has traditionally referred to the following central banks:
Australia.
In Australia, the "big four banks" refers to the four largest banks that have historically dominated Australia's banking industry in terms of market share, revenue, and total assets. The "big four banks" of Australia are:
A longstanding policy of the federal government in Australia has been to maintain this status quo, called the four pillars policy. The policy has been maintained through the Global Recession of 2008–09, as Westpac acquired St George Bank and the Commonwealth Bank acquired Bankwest, reinforcing the special status of the "big four".
Austria.
The "Big Four" banks of Austria are:

Historically, during the 1920s, the term "Big Four" applied to the Four Northern Banks of the Republic of China (i.e., the four most capitalized commercial banks in Northern China). These were the Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, the Kincheng Banking Corporation, the Continental Bank and The China &amp; South Sea Bank. They were contrasted with the Three Southern Banks of Southern China.
By 1949, the "Big Four" banks were the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Central Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China. All four were state-owned. Together with the Central Trust of China, Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of China, and Central Cooperative Treasury of China, these banks were called the "four banks, two bureaus, one treasury" (四行两局一库).

Furthermore, as of September 2016, there are more than 51 banks in Lebanon, one of the smallest countries in the Middle East, a fact that has always made investors from the Arab countries, especially the GCC petrodollar in addition to the European and world investors, to place their funds in the Lebanese banks.
Luxembourg.
The "big four" full-service banks in Luxembourg are:
There are bigger banks in Luxembourg, but these only deliver a limited number of services such as investment banking, private banking, or corporate banking only. Luxembourg is a financial center.

The market leader for the Netherlands, ING Group, is one of the world's largest multinational banking and financial service corporations, with products and services reaching over 41 countries worldwide.
New Zealand.
New Zealand is Australia's closest neighbour, with very close cultural and economic ties. The big four Australian banks (often referred to collectively as the "big banks" or the "big Aussie banks") also dominate the banking sector in New Zealand, through subsidiaries:
Together they hold over 90% of gross loans and advances in New Zealand as well as close to 90% of all mortgages.
These four NZ subsidiaries are massively profitable and sometimes even outperform the Australian parent companies. The extent to which they dominate the banking sector can be seen in profits: In the 2012/2013 financial year, the largest of the Big Banks, ANZ New Zealand, made a profit of NZ$1.37 billion. The smallest, BNZ, made a profit of NZ$695 million. State-owned Kiwibank, community trust-owned TSB Bank, SBS Bank (formerly Southland Building Society) and Heartland Bank, the next four largest banks by profit, made NZ$97 million, NZ$73.5 million, NZ$14 million and NZ$7 million (albeit with an underlying result of about NZ$30 million) respectively. Thus, the profit of New Zealand's next four largest banks (after the Big Four) is equal to less than 30% of the smallest of the Big Four, BNZ.
Nigeria.
The term "Big Five" is used instead of four, with five banks dominating the Nigerian banking world. In 2011, these top five banks had a combined balance sheet, including contingents, of 12.9 trillion naira ($821 billion), 33 percent higher than the prior year.

SmILE

SmILE is a showcase car designed for Greenpeace in 1996 to demonstrate how fuel efficient a car can be. The name stands for "Small, Intelligent, Light, Efficient'. It is based on the Renault Twingo, halving its fuel consumption to 3.3 l/100km (30 km/L or 85 mpg (imperial) / 68 mpg (US)). 
An important issue in the design was that it should use off-the-shelf technology (parts and know-how). As a result, in mass production, it should not cost significantly more than a 'heavier' equivalent. The engine should even be cheaper because it is made of fewer parts. However, parts that would be more expensive are supercharging (be it pressure wave supercharger or turbo-supercharger) and the wheels and the wheel suspension, which are made of aluminium. 
The major changes made to the Twingo are:
The main consumption change of the engine stems from its more frequent use in the higher load range, which results in higher thermal stress. This is compensated for by an ingenious cooling system. The mean piston velocities are in the customary range. The use of the latest technologies in materials and surface coatings guarantees stability of piston rings and cylinder bearing surfaces despite the higher pressures due to supercharging.
At least a further 80 kg weight reduction could be achieved through the use of fibre composite materials, a smaller tank and replacing the glass windows with polycarbonate, but these modifications were not selected. The changes did not alter the safety standards of the Twingo and the airbag and lateral collision protection were kept in place. Aluminium accounts for 45 kg of the weight of the SmILE (7%), through replacement of both axles, wheel suspension and seat structure. In average cars in Europe this is 65 kg (6%) and rising. One problem with aluminium is the high energy cost of primary production. However, recycled aluminium has a much lower energy cost and identical mechanical properties. 
In Germany, around 10% of all cars are replaced annually by new vehicles, so if all new vehicles had the SmILE standard that would mean an annual reduction of the CO2 emissions of the car fleet by 5%. A similar reduction in fuel consumption would be possible for all petrol cars, but not diesels because they are heavier (and require heavier batteries). The Twingo was chosen because of its favourable ratio between internal space and exterior and because it is a reasonable all-round car for everyone (it is the most imported car in Germany).
Greenpeace says that ultimately, this car is not a definitive solution. Reduction of the number of cars is still necessary, also to reduce other problems, such as traffic jams, the emission of toxic substances in cities, the death toll on roads (over a million per year) and the destruction (and carving up) of nature to build roads. Alternative fuels would be a better solution, but time is pressing, so an intermediate off-the-shelf solution like the SmILE is needed.
The car was designed by the Swiss company of Wenko. For this, they received a loan of roughly 1.3 million euro from Greenpeace, which they will return if the engine concept is taken over by a manufacturer for series production or profits are obtained from issuing licences.

Portuguese Marine Corps

The Portuguese Marine Corps () is the special operations capable amphibious force of the Portuguese Navy. 
It has roles similar to the ones of the USMC Reconnaissance Battalions and of the British Royal Marine Commandos. The Corps is specialised in air assault, amphibious warfare, anti-tank warfare, coastal reconnaissance and raiding, commando style raids, counterinsurgency, desert warfare, indirect fire support raiding, irregular warfare, ISTAR, jungle warfare, maneuver warfare, maritime interdiction, mountain warfare, providing security at naval base or shore stations, reconnaissance for gathering military intelligence, support special operations, tracking targets, urban warfare, and VBSS operations. It is an Elite Marine Commando Force, operating as a rapid-reaction force. Today's Corpo de Fuzileiros is the premier Commando style Raid Force. The "Fuzileiros" remains an all-volunteer force with an intensive screening and selection process followed by combat-focused training. "Fuzileiros" are resourced to maintain exceptional proficiency, experience and readiness.
History.
The Portuguese Marines () have their direct origin in the oldest permanent military unit of Portugal, the regiment of the Navy of the Crown of Portugal ("Terço da Armada da Coroa de Portugal"), created in 1618. However, since 1585, specialized troops existed to provide artillery and riflemen in the Portuguese warships. The regiment of the Navy was soon considered an elite unit. As the King of Portugal did not have a royal guard (only the ceremonial Royal Guard of the Halberdiers), this regiment was also used in the role of bodyguard of the Monarchs.
In the 18th century, a second regiment of naval infantry was created. In 1791, a regiment of naval artillery was added to the force.
In 1797, in the reign of Queen Maria I, all the regiments of the Navy were merged and integrated into the new Royal Brigade of the Navy ("Brigada Real da Marinha"), which included three divisions: Fusiliers ("fuzileiros"), Artillerymen ("artilheiros") and Artificers ("artifices e lastradores"). In 1807, the brigade was reorganized, going to be made of three battalions, all of them of artillerymen.
In 1808, the Army of Napoleon invaded and occupied Portugal. In order not to be captured and, so, to maintain secure the Portuguese sovereignty, the Royal Family and most of the Court relocated to the Portuguese colony of Brazil, on board of the Portuguese fleet and accompanied by the majority of the Royal Brigade of the Navy. This contingent of the brigade continued to remain in Brazil, even after its independence in 1822, given origin to what is now the Brazilian Marine Corps. In 1809, a force of the brigade in Brazil participated in the Portuguese conquest of French Guiana.
With most of the original force of the brigade remaining in Brazil, in 1822 it started to be reconstituted in Portugal. In 1823, it was organized in two battalions.
During the Portuguese Civil War (1828–1834), the Royal Brigade of the Navy aligned on the side of the Miguelite forces. On the opposite side however, the Liberals created a Battalion of the Navy ("Batalhão de Marinha"). In 1832, the Liberal Battalion of the Navy was augmented and transformed in a Regiment ("Regimento da Armada") with four battalions.
In 1836, already after the end of the Civil War, the Royal Brigade of the Navy was extinguished. It was replaced by the new Naval Battalion ("Batalhão Naval") created in 1837.
In each of the ships' crews of the Portuguese Navy, only the officers and the members of the embarked detachments of the Naval Battalion (and previously of the former Royal Brigade of the Navy) were military personnel, with the sailors being civilians. The different status of the several parts of the crews always created issues.
In 1851, the decision was taken to militarize the sailors, with the creation of the Corps of Military Seamen ("Corpo de Marinheiros Militares"). This Corps started to be responsible for the providing of the ships' crews. It was organized in 22 crew companies, each one subdivided in two half-companies, plus a depot company. Each of these companies and half companies was intended to constitute the crew of a ship, in rotation. All seamen of the Corps received a general training that included seamanship, artillery, infantry, bladed weapon combat, boarding and amphibious landing. In each company, a number of seamen received an advanced training in naval artillery, constituting its squad or artillerymen. This military training meant that the seamen were able to assume the responsibility to perform also the role of naval infantry when needed, what made unnecessary the existence of the Naval Battalion, which was then dissolved.
From this date, whenever there was a need to perform an amphibious operation, landing detachments were constituted with seamen taken from the ships' crews. For the colonial campaigns of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and for the World War I, larger naval infantry forces and naval battalions were organized in the Corps of Seamen itself.
In 1924, a permanent unit of naval infantry was again created, this being the new Brigade of the Naval Guard ("Brigada da Guarda Naval"). However, it ceased to exist in 1934, with the role of naval infantry being again entirely assumed by the regular seamen when needed.
1960 – Reactivation and establishment of the Navy’s Commando force: The Fuzileiros
The Elite Navy Commandos only reappeared as permanent force in 1961.
In 1960, four members of the Portuguese Navy (one officer and three enlisted sailors) were selected to attend the Commando Course at the Royal Marines Commando Training Centre in Lympstone, England, completing it successfully and leading, in 1961, to the establishment of the Navy’s Commando force—the Fuzileiros .
Upon their return in early 1961, the Portuguese Navy formally established the Fuzileiros as an elite counter-guerrilla commando force to meet the demands of the Overseas War that began that year.
Adoption of the beret
Following Royal Marines Commandos tradition, those first cadres adopted the green beret—worn pulled to the right with the bronze-shield (Globe and Laurel) badge above the left eye—to signify commando qualification.
However, Portugal’s airborne forces (Paraquedistas), who were the first Portuguese to wear any beret (a dark-forest green) starting in 1956, already used green headgear. To avoid confusion, the Fuzileiros chose a distinct dark navy-blue beret.
The starting the formation of the Elite Navy Commando Force Fuzileiros. The Fuzileiros were created in 1961 as counter-guerrilla navy special forces, corresponding to the Portuguese Navy's need to have units specially adapted to this type of warfare, which it had to face within the scope of the Overseas War, which began in 1961. With the beginning of the Colonial War. Besides the Marines School ("Escola de Fuzileiros"), two types of operational marine units were created at that time, these being the detachments of special marines (DFE, "destacamentos de fuzileiros especiais") and the companies of marines (CF, "companhias de fuzileiros"). While the DFE were designed to operate as Marine Raiders units, the CF were focused in the naval patrolling and in the defense of naval ships and facilities. During this war, and up to 1975, more than 14,000 marines fought in Portuguese Guinea, Angola and Mozambique.
Until 1975, a unified Marine Corps Command did not exist, with the diverse DFE and CF being separate units, depending from the several naval and maritime defense commands of the areas where they operated. In this year, the Marine Corps ("Corpo de Fuzileiros") was created, unifying all marine units under a single command and become Elite Raid Force.
Since 2021, the Fuzileiros have been undergoing restructuring, with the implementation of the new 'light and fast' concept. This approach enables the application of guerrilla tactics from sea to land, emphasizing mobility, maneuverability, surprise, and superior training as key elements. The goal is to create an elite Marine Commando force, capable of moving, infiltrating, and withdrawing with complete surprise.
Organization.
Since 2015, the Portuguese Marine Corps is organized into:
Includes three permanent Marine forces:
Constitutes a special operations maritime task unit (SOMTU).
The permanent task units of the Force Projection Unit are designed to conduct Commando Raids.
The Marine Corps elements are based at the Vale do Zebro facilities (Marines School) and the Alfeite facilitiesMarines Base.
Training.
Initial training to become an enlisted "Fuzileiro" (marine) lasts about 42 weeks. The training is conducted at the Marines School ("Escola de Fuzileiros") in Vale de Zebro. It is physically and mentally rigorous and demanding, with only 15% to 35% of the initial trainees passing and becoming "Fuzileiros".
Since the founding of the Fuzileiros School, training has remained unparalleled: every exercise is timed and scored, and any failure is immediately “punished” with additional physical tasks. Recruits undertake 20–30 km marches with full equipment in all weather conditions; traverse mud and land obstacle courses; conduct night-navigation drills; and participate in intensive weapons instruction,reconnaissance patrols,Commando style raid tactics, ambushes, CQB/urban operations, NBC Warfare, Tactical Emergency Medical,live-fire assault tactics, rappelling, climbing, small-craft handling, basic demolitions, communications exercises, and hand-to-hand combat . The final phase of the course consists of field exercises simulating real-world operations in both terrestrial and amphibious scenarios—reconnaissance patrols, commando-style raids, ambushes, urban combat (CQB), and SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, 
and Escape).
Culminating in a 50 km group march to be completed within a set time .
After completing their training with success, the "Fuzileiros" receive the dark blue beret and the course badge on an official ceremony before being assigned to operational units.
During and after the Fuzileiros Course, Fuzileiros military personnel receive training in areas as varied as:

Tarentaise cattle

Tarentaise cattle descend from the domestic cattle of the Tarentaise valley in France where they were isolated from other breeds for many thousands of years. The cattle adapted in such a way as to allow them to exist in high altitudes and be able to range in very steep and rough terrain to forage. They are used in France today to produce the cheese with a distinct flavor that comes from the high alpine villages of the Tarentaise, Beaufortain and Maurienne valley. These cattle have found special niches around the world in commercial cattle grazing and calving. In the USA these cattle are used primarily for producing crossbred cows distinctly suited for tough rangeland conditions and higher elevations. They are also bred for the beauty of their markings and their docile demeanor.

Lodge Park and Sherborne Estate

Lodge Park was built as a grandstand in the Sherborne Estate near the villages of Sherborne, Aldsworth and Northleach in Gloucestershire, England. The site is owned by the National Trust and the former grandstand is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. It is England's only surviving 17th-century deer course and grandstand.
In the 19th century Lodge Park was modified into a house, then a row of cottages, and then into a house again. It was bequeathed to the National Trust in 1982, and restored to its original form as a grandstand. Lodge Park is open to the public at advertised times, and the footpaths in the Sherborne Estate are available to the public at all times.
Lodge Park.
History.
In the early 1630s John 'Crump' Dutton created a deer course on his Sherborne Estate; this consisted of a park for containing the deer, a mile-long walled enclosure for the chase, and, overlooking the finish, a grandstand. His grandfather, Thomas Dutton, was descended from the Dutton family of Dutton, Cheshire, and had bought the manor of Sherborne in 1551. As originally constructed, the grandstand consisted of two storeys with a flat roof and a basement. At the entrance was a portico with a balcony, and the basement contained the kitchens. At the back of the building was a range containing the staircases linking the floors. The ground floor was the entrance hall for welcoming guests, and the first floor consisted of the Great Room where the guests were entertained. The deer coursing could be observed from the flat roof or from the balcony over the portico.
During the 1720s the building was remodelled and refurnished by Sir John Dutton, 2nd Baronet. New stone floors were added, a new plasterwork ceiling was added to the Great Room, and new furniture was designed. Dutton employed Charles Bridgeman to redesign the landscaping. Jeffrey Haworth is of the opinion that the new interiors and some of the furniture was designed by William Kent.
There were then few changes until the early 19th century when the building was modified to make it into a house. The staircase range and the chimney piece from the Great Room were removed; the latter was incorporated in the rebuilding of Sherborne House to the design of Lewis Wyatt. The removal of the staircase range adversely affected the stability of the house. A pitched roof was installed in place of the original flat roof, lowering the ceiling of the former Great Room. In the middle of the 19th century the interior of the building was gutted and it was converted into a row of cottages; this further impaired the stability of the building.
Between 1898 and 1902 the building was converted into a dower house for Emily, the wife of Edward Dutton, 4th Baron Sherborne. The rear wing was rebuilt in a different form. The first floor was made into a bedroom with an "en suite" bathroom. The dining room was on the ground floor, with a lounge and a staircase in the newly built rear wing; the staircase led to a drawing room on the first floor. However Lady Sherborne died in 1905 before her husband, and it is unlikely that she ever occupied the house. Further alterations were made in 1938, when the house was tenanted, and again in the 1950s, when Charles Dutton, 7th Baron Sherborne, and his wife moved into the house. Charles died in 1982 and bequeathed the house and the estate to the National Trust.
Restoration.
When the National Trust acquired the property the house was in a poor condition; the external walls were moving and the chimney stacks were collapsing. The interior consisted of "a jumble of small-scale modern rooms and corridors". Howard Colvin had discovered a 1634 description of the building. Further information was found in the Sherborne Archive in the Gloucester Record Office. Essential repairs were carried out, and archaeological investigations revealed more evidence about the building's original form and its subsequent alterations. It was decided to restore the building to a condition close to its original form.
Architecture.
As Clive Aslet states, the building "is bursting with architecture". A description written in 1634 suggests that the design was inspired by Inigo Jones' Banqueting House in Whitehall, London. At one time it was thought that it had been designed by Jones, but this is incorrect. The citation in "Images of England" states that it was probably designed by John Webb and built by Valentine Strong of Taynton.
Exterior.
The building is constructed in ashlar stone, with rusticated quoins and a moulded plinth. Its main part has a rectangular plan in two storeys, with a flat lead roof and an extension to the rear. The east face forms the entrance front. It is symmetrical in five bays with a protruding three-bay single-storey portico. The portico has three round arches on columns and is surmounted by a balustrade. The central doorway has a round arch and on each side are two mullioned and transomed windows. On the first floor is a central doorway with a mullioned window above and arched niches in each side. The other bays contain mullioned and transomed windows. There are string courses between the storeys and over the upper storey. Over the lateral two windows on the ground floor are curved tympani, and over each bay in the upper storey is a broken tympanum. Each of these tympani contains a sculpted human head. A balustrade runs around the top of the roof, and at its rear are six joined chimneys.
Interior.
The entrance hall contains two original arches. One of these includes a fireplace, the other leads to the staircase. The National Trust has inserted a panelled wall on the left. The staircase has been rebuilt by the National Trust in a stairwell measuring by , and its oak balusters have been copied from those at Cornbury Park in Oxfordshire.
The Great Room on the first floor has been restored in an attempt to link with its original design, including its classical ordering with a dado, pilasters and entablature. The walls would have been hung with tapestry, but this has been replaced with family portraits that originally hung in Sherborne House. The floor has been reconstructed, using chestnut boards measuring from the Welsh borders. The chimneypiece has been reconstructed by masons from the Hereford Cathedral workshop.
Associated structures.
Three structures associated with the Lodge Park have been designated as Grade II listed buildings by Historic England. About to the south of building is a pair of gates with piers that date from the mid-18th century or earlier. The gates are constructed in cast iron and the piers are in limestone. The piers consist of hammer-dressed quoins up to the level of the top of the gates; on the top of each is a large stone block surmounted by a triangular pedimented capping stone. Some to the east is a fountain probably dating from 1898. This consists of a circular stone surround with four urns, one at each cardinal point. In the centre is the fountain, also in the form of an urn, but larger than those on the surround. Further to the east, some from the building, is a pair of limestone lodges with adjoining walls, gate piers and gates also dating from about 1898.
Parkland.
To the west of Park Lodge is an area of parkland of 115 hectares. This was landscaped to a design by Charles Bridgeman from the mid-1720s for Sir John Dutton. It is registered by Historic England as Grade I. The park contained a series of "rooms" (presumably for herding deer), a Great Avenue, and a former canal. Bridgeman's proposal for a serpentine canal was not carried through.
In the parkland there is a long barrow at map reference SP1426712550, with a capstone and two upright stones visible at the south-eastern end.
Sherborne Estate.
The estate is open to the public. It contains wild animals including fallow and roe deer, badgers and foxes. There are a number of footpaths and walks in the estate, including a sculpture trail; some of these start from Ewe Pen Barn (). On the estate are water-meadows, including draining channels and sluices ().
The estate was the venue for the BBC Two wildlife television programmes "Springwatch" and "Autumnwatch" in 2017, followed by "Winterwatch" in January 2018.
Present day.
Lodge Park is open to the public at advertised times and has a small shop and provides light refreshments. The building is available for weddings. The Sherborne Estate is open all year.

Jockin Arputham

Jockin Arputham (15 August 1947 – 13 October 2018) was an Indian community leader and activist, known for his campaigning work of more than 40 years on issues related to slums and shanty towns. He was born in Karnataka, India and moved to Mumbai, where he quickly became politicized and established himself as a community leader. In 2014, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, alongside the organisation he helped to found, Slum Dwellers International. In 2011, he received the Padma Shri in New Delhi for his contributions to social work, presented by the President of India.
Early life.
Arputham was born to Tamil parents who lived in Kolar Gold Fields (in present-day Kolar district of Karnataka) on 15 August 1947, the same day of India's independence from the United Kingdom. When he was 16, he moved to Bangalore looking for work.
Politicization.
When he was eighteen, he moved to Mumbai where he worked as a carpenter and building contractor. Since he had nowhere to live, he slept on the street in Janata Colony, a slum of 70,000 people. He worked at the construction of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). Seeing that he did not need credentials to do so, he began a company to manage workers and organised a school in the slum. The city did not organize a rubbish collection, so he encouraged 3,000 children to bring a bag of garbage to a picnic at the council offices and won a regular rubbish collection service.
Between 1971 and 1972, Arputham went to Kolkata to work with refugees escaping war in Bangladesh.
Back in Mumbai, when Janata colony was threatened with eviction in the 1970s, he helped organize protests and court cases. He was arrested over 40 times. He also sat outside the Parliament in Delhi for 18 days until the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi would see him. She promised they would not be evicted, but in 1976, 12,000 police stormed the slum and evicted all 70,000 people in one night. Everyone was forcibly transferred to the still extant Cheetah Camp slum.
When India declared a state of emergency, Arputham was forced to flee the country in 1977 to avoid imprisonment. With the help of the World Council of Churches he went to the Philippines visiting local slumdwellers groups. Every three months he had to leave the country to renew his visa so he went to Japan, Malaysia and South Korea.
Career.
Arputham was the president of the National Slum Dwellers Federation (NSDF) which he founded in the late 1970s. He was also co-founder of Slum Dwellers International (SDI) which networks slum and shack dweller organizations and federations from over thirty countries across the world. The National Slum Dwellers Federation works closely with Mahila Milan, a collective of savings groups formed by homeless women and women living in slums across India, and with the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers (SPARC), a Mumbai-based NGO. This alliance has supported thousands of the urban poor access better housing and sanitation.
Slum Dwellers International claimed the alliance helped 1 million people in 15,000 slum dwellers-managed saving groups. Further they had secured land rights for 128,000 families, building over 20,000 toilets and 100,000 houses. The National Slum Dwellers Federation stated it had helped 60,000 families improve their housing situation in Mumbai. 
Arputham has also worked with the police to set up "police panchayats" in many of the informal settlements in Mumbai. Here, for the first time, police are assigned to work in these settlements and are supported by a committee of ten residents from the community (made up of three men and seven women). The concept was pioneered by Anami Narayan Roy, the Police Commissioner of Pune.
A week after his death, Arputham was commemorated by a large poster calling him the "slum king" in Dharavi, where he lived.

AikBank (full legal name: "AikBank a.d. Belgrade") is a commercial bank based in Belgrade, Serbia.
History.
1976–2014.
Upon being founded, AIK Banka initially operated as an internal bank of the Agro Industrial Combine (Agroindustrijsko komercijalna) Niš since 1976. On 10 August 1993, after obtaining the license of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, it became a full-fledged financial institution, working with legal entities and individual clients, registered as a joint venture.
Greek ATEbank acquired 24.99% of common and 24.99% of preferential shares of AIK Banka in 2006 for an undisclosed amount.

2006–07 Phoenix Suns season

The 2006–07 Phoenix Suns season was the 39th season of the franchise of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team attempted to return to the Western Conference finals, where they were eliminated in six games by the Dallas Mavericks in the previous season. After an excellent regular season in which they posted a 61–21 record, in a rematch of last season's first round where they came back from a 3–1 deficit, they defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in the opening round of the playoffs in five games, but were narrowly defeated in the Western Conference semifinals in six games by the more experienced, heavily favored, and eventual NBA champion San Antonio Spurs. The Suns had the best team offensive rating in the NBA.
The Suns' marketing slogan for the 2006–07 season was Eyes on the Prize. Billboards and bus wraps showed closeups of the eyes of a different Suns player, each face photographed in a strongly tinted purple color (orange on some ads), with small reflections of the NBA championship trophy reflected in the pupils.
This was the last season the Suns won their division until the 2020–21 season.

Abune Antonios

Abune Antonios (; 11 July 1929 – 9 February 2022) was the third Patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church. He was deposed by the Synod of Asmara in 2006, and was placed under house arrest thereafter.
Ecclesiastical career.
Antonios was born on 11 July 1929 in the town of Hembrti, north of Asmara in the province of Hamasien. He was ordained priest in 1943 and later elected Abbot in 1955. When the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church sought autocephaly, he was one of five abbots of monasteries that went to Egypt to be ordained as bishops so that the church would have its own Holy Synod. He was ordained as Bishop Antonios of Hamasien-Asmara on 19 June 1994 in Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Cairo, by Shenouda III, Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Following the death of Yacob in 2003, he was elected Patriarch in popular elections which were unanimously endorsed by the Holy Synod of the church. His ordination and enthronement as Patriarch took place on 23 April 2004 in Asmara, at the hands of Pope Shenouda III, assisted by Eritrean and Coptic Orthodox Metropolitans and Bishops. He was the first Patriarch of Eritrea to have been enthroned who had not previously been a bishop in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.
Removal from church.
In January 2005, the Patriarch's annual Nativity message was not broadcast or televised. On 27 May 2007, he was replaced as Patriarch by Dioskoros, with the support of the Eritrean government. Antonios remained under house arrest and strict surveillance and held without charge. He reportedly seldom received visitors, including relatives, and had no telephone service. Since 2007, Antonios had been considered by the United States to be a religious prisoner of conscience. His removal at the behest of the Eritrean government was denounced by the other Oriental Orthodox Churches, who refused to recognize Dioskoros as Patriarch of Eritrea.
In July 2019, in an unprecedented move, bishops of the Holy Synod of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church excommunicated Antonios for heresy. The letter from five of the six most senior Eritrean bishops declared that "His name should never be mentioned and remembered and those who do so will be punished severely." Although the patriarch was expelled from being a member of the church, the bishops promised he could still live in a church building. The president of the Standing Conference of Oriental Orthodox Churches condemned the excommunication.
He died while in detention in Asmara, Eritrea, on 9 February 2022 at the age of 93.

Abune Dioskoros

Abune Diosqoros (born Diosqoros Hagos Mendefera; 1935 – 21 December 2015) was the fourth Patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, appointed in April 2007.
Bishop.
Born in 1935, Dioskoros was consecrated as bishop of the Seraye district in the feast of Pentecost on 19 May 1994 by Coptic Orthodox Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria. In 2004 he was transferred to the Diocese of the South West, where was a ruling bishop until his disputed election as the head of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church on 19 April 2007.
Patriarch.
Dioskoros' appointment was made possible because the regime in Eritrea changed the rules for the appointment, so that the Holy Synod of the church could assign a layman to be the new Patriarch.
The removal of Antonios (1927-2022), the former legal Patriarch, at the behest of the Eritrean government was denounced by Coptic Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church who have refused to recognize Dioskoros as legitimate Patriarch of Eritrea, as did several Eritrean churches, particularly in the diaspora, which continued to endorse his predecessor. The former Patriarch Antonios, who was removed from the post after having criticized the Eritrean government for interference in church affairs, has been held under house arrest by the regime in Eritrea since 2005. 
In October 2014 the Union of Eritrean Monasteries issued a decree excommunicating Dioskoros' governmental allies, the priest Habtom Russom Habte and the layman Yoftahe Dimetros Gebre-mariam, citing a long list of alleged abuses during their administration during Doskoros' reign. However Dioskoros was not directly excommunicated in the process. The Eritrean Government accused several monks of being a major force behind the excommunication letter. A number of the monks allegedly involved decided to escape and take refuge in Ethiopia.
Dioskoros died on 21 December 2015. Since his death, the position of patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church fell vacant until 2021, with the election of Qerlos.

Functional structuralism

Functional structuralism is a spin-off from systems theory in sociology. Systems theory, following Talcott Parsons, began as a structural-functionalist theory, that is, social structures were stressed and placed at the center of analysis, and social functions were deduced from these structures. In functional-structuralist theory, in contrast, the initial focus is on the function of an aspect of society, and only after functions have been specified are enabling structures designated. Functional structuralism is primarily associated with the work of German sociologist Niklas Luhmann.

Maryland Loyalists Battalion

The Maryland Loyalists Battalion, also known as the First Battalion of Maryland Loyalists, was a Loyalist infantry unit which served on the side of the Kingdom of Great Britain during the American Revolutionary War. Raised in 1777 by Loyalist officer James Chalmers, the unit, consisting of one battalion, was organizationally part of the British Provincial Corps and saw action at the 1778 Battle of Monmouth and the 1781 Siege of Pensacola. It was disbanded in 1783 in the wake of the Patriot victory in the war.
Background.
As with other colonies in British America, Maryland was bitterly divided by the American Revolution. Members of the existing political elite tended to make reluctant revolutionaries; men such as Benedict Swingate Calvert, illegitimate son of the ruling Calvert family and a judge of the land office, remained loyal to the British Crown, and would suffer the consequences. Like other loyalists, Calvert would find himself on the losing side of the Revolutionary War, effectively ending his political career. The Annapolis Convention of 1774 to 1776 saw the old Maryland elite overthrown – men like Calvert, Governor Eden and George Steuart all lost their political power, and in many cases their land and wealth. After the war, Loyalists would have to pay triple taxes and were forced to sign the loyalty oath. Many had their lands and property confiscated.
Service.
The unit was composed primarily of colonists from the Eastern Shore of Maryland; it was commissioned in British-held Philadelphia in mid-October 1777 as "The First Battalion of Maryland Loyalists." The unit's commander, Lt. Col. James Chalmers of Newtown, Maryland (present-day Chestertown), was an active Loyalist writer. 
The Maryland Loyalists saw limited action in 1778 at the Battle of Monmouth before being shipped off to Pensacola, West Florida, to fight the Spanish in the fall. A number of soldiers of the battalion died of smallpox upon arrival. Weakened by the epidemic and limited manpower, the Maryland Loyalists garrison was subsequently defeated by the Spanish in the siege of Pensacola in 1781. After a brief time as Spanish prisoners of war in Cuba, the battalion was eventually sent back to New York City, the command center for British forces during the war.
After the war, the soldiers of the battalion, along with many other American loyalists, were transported by the British government as refugees to Nova Scotia. In the fall of 1783, a ship carrying the exiled battalion was shipwrecked off the Nova Scotia coast. The survivors made up the first British American citizens of the new Canadian province of New Brunswick.
Notable soldiers.
William Augustus Bowles was an ensign in the Maryland Loyalists Battalion. In the 1790s, he became a leader of the Creek Indians.
Philip Barton Key was a captain in the Maryland Loyalists Battalion. After the war, Key studied law in England and returned to Maryland in 1785. He was admitted to the bar and entered private practice in Leonardtown, Maryland from 1787 to 1790. He practiced in Annapolis, Maryland from 1790 to 1794, and from 1799 to 1800. Key was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1794 to 1799 and Mayor of Annapolis from 1797 to 1798.

Henrique Capriles

Henrique Capriles Radonski (; born 11 July 1972) is a Venezuelan politician and lawyer, who served as the 36th Governor of Miranda from 2008 to 2017.
Born in Caracas, he received a degree in law from the Universidad Católica Andrés Bello, and later in tax law from the Central University of Venezuela. He first ventured into politics at age 26, when he became the youngest member ever elected to the Venezuelan parliament. He secured a seat in the Chamber of Deputies in the 1998 parliamentary elections, under the Christian Democratic Party (Copei). He served as vice president of the Congress and president of the Chamber of Deputies until their dissolution by the Constituent Assembly in August 1999.
In 2000, he co-founded the political party Primero Justicia, alongside politicians Julio Borges and Leopoldo Lopez, and ran successfully for the mayorship of the Baruta municipality in the regional elections held in July 2000, and later for the governorship of the Miranda state in 2008. Capriles became the opposition candidate at the 2012 and 2013 presidential elections, and faced then-President Hugo Chávez and Vice President Nicolás Maduro respectively.
His defeat in 2012 marked the first loss of his political career. Maduro narrowly defeated Capriles in the 2013 elections, a result that sparked controversy and debate amid the opposition's claims of electoral fraud. Between both presidential campaigns, Capriles successfully secured his re-election as Governor of Miranda during the 2012 regional elections. He has repeatedly been the target of smear campaigns by political opponents who seek to capitalize on homophobic and antisemitic currents in Venezuelan society.
Capriles Radonski is of Sephardi Jewish and Ashkenazi Jewish descent – his grandparents emigrated from German and Russian occupied Poland during World War II; however, he self-describes as Catholic, revealing that his greatest hero in history was Jesus Christ. He dated Venezuelan actress Erika de la Vega between his first and second tenure as Mayor. Prior to his political career, he worked in the public and private sectors at several tax and law firms of Venezuela. Capriles is a member of the International Fiscal Association.
On 5 April 2017, Capriles was formally banned for 15 years from political activity accused by the Venezuelan government of alleged "administrative irregularities" which had occurred under his governorship. He ceased to be the Governor of Miranda in October after the 2017 regional elections, and subsequently declared his intent to leave the Democratic Unity Roundtable in protest against what he considered its legitimizing the Maduro government.
Early life.
Henrique Capriles Radonski was born in Caracas on 11 July 1972. His parents are Henrique Capriles García, a successful businessman, descendant of Juan Agustín Bolívar, who was half-brother of Simón Bolívar and Mónica Cristina Radonski-Bochenek. His maternal grandparents were Ashkenazi Jews who emigrated from German and Russian occupied Poland following World War II. His great-grand parents were murdered at the Treblinka extermination camp during the Holocaust. His maternal grandmother, Lili Bochenek, lived for 20 months in the Warsaw Ghetto. His paternal grandfather, Armando Capriles-Myerston, was a Sephardi Jew.
In the 1950s, Henrique Capriles García helped launch Kraft Foods' entry into Venezuela by inviting the vice-president of its Nabisco subsidiary and persuading him to invest in the country. His maternal grandparents, Andrés Radonski and Lili Bochenek, emigrated to Venezuela in 1947 from Poland. Andrés Radonski was an engineer active in the cinema business in Poland; he opened his first cinema several years later, in the eastern city of Puerto La Cruz.
The company operated under the name Circuito Radonski. It was merged in 1998 alongside Venefilms and Grupo Blanco to create the country's largest cinema chain, Cinex. He is also the descendant of relatives who operated the media conglomerate, Cadena Capriles.
Education.
Capriles enrolled at the Andrés Bello Catholic University to study commerce law. He received his degree in 1994, and then continued studies at the Central University of Venezuela. He received a degree in tax law several years later. He took additional studies at the IBFD International Tax Academy in Amsterdam, the Pan American Center of Tax Managers in Viterbo, and Columbia University. He is a sitting member of the International Fiscal Association and the World Association of Young Jurors.
Political career.
Early years and Chamber of Deputies (1995–1999).
Capriles first ventured into politics between 1995 and 1998, when he aided his cousin, deputy Armando Capriles, in the writing of laws for the Bicameral Commission of Energy of the then-existing Congress of the Republic. Armando, who was a partisan of the Christian democratic party Copei, later offered Henrique the possibility of being a candidate for a seat at the Chamber of Deputies at the 1998 parliamentary elections, affiliating with Copei (Social Christian Party). Capriles accepted, and successfully secured a seat at the Congress in representation of the Zulia state. He became the youngest member ever elected to the Venezuelan parliament, and later held the positions of Vice President of the Congress and President of the Chamber of Deputies.
In August 1999, the Constituent Assembly abolished Capriles' seat, and dissolved the Congress. Capriles criticized Chávez's new constitution, stating at the time, "This is a corrupt constitution that will leave Venezuela backward and poor", while further denouncing the centralized power that it granted the president.
Mayor of Baruta (2000–2008).
The Congress was replaced by the National Assembly, and new deputies were elected in a general election held, in 2000. That year, Capriles founded the political party Primero Justicia, alongside politicians Julio Borges and Leopoldo Lopez, although the entity had already existed as a civil association since 1992. He did not run for a seat at the newly created Assembly; however, he and Leopoldo Lopez pursued the mayoralties of the Baruta and Chacao municipalities, respectively, at the regional elections held in July 2000. Lopez won with 51,5% of the vote, whereas Capriles received 62,9%. Borges secured a seat in the National Assembly. As mayor, Capriles focused on the reduction of crime within his municipality, as well as on improving the overall infrastructure of the area.
In 2002, President Hugo Chávez was the target of a failed coup d'état that removed him from office on 11 April 2002, after several days of violent protests in Caracas. The coup, triggered by major political discontent in a sector of the Venezuelan population, was initially staged by members of the military and the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce ("Fedecámaras"), represented by its president Pedro Carmona, who was declared the interim president. The following day, the Cuban embassy, located in Baruta, received severe damage, caused by opposition protesters who cut off the water and electricity supply, smashed windows, damaged six staff vehicles, and blocked the Cuban ambassador, German Sanchez Otero, from leaving. The same day, Interior Minister Ramon Rodriguez Chacin was detained by the municipal police.
Chávez returned to the presidency on 13 April 2002. Capriles then faced charges as a result of the attacks on the embassy. In March 2004, Danilo Anderson publicly declared that Capriles would be arrested; the warrant was annulled in early April. In May 2004, Capriles was arrested on the orders of Anderson, on the grounds that Capriles might flee the country; he was released on probation in September, pending his trial. In December 2006, Capriles was acquitted of the charge of fomenting violence in the siege of the Cuban embassy during the coup attempt, but five months later, his acquittal was annulled by the court of appeal, and the case was re-opened in October 2008. The U.S. Department of State mentioned Capriles' case in its 2008 Human Rights report as a denial of a fair public trial.
Governor of Miranda (2008–2017).
In the 2008 Venezuelan regional elections, Capriles was elected Governor of Miranda state, defeating Diosdado Cabello. During his tenure, Capriles invested in education, opening 39 schools by 2011, compared to 7 under the previous governor. Capriles passed on the governorship of the state of Miranda to the Secretary General of Miranda, Adriana D'Elia, on 6 June 2012, in compliance with Venezuelan law which states an incumbent governor cannot run for the presidency of the nation. He was elected again on 16 December 2012, beating former Vice President Elías Jaua.
On 5 April 2017, the Comptroller General of Venezuela notified Capriles that for 15 years, he would be prevented from participating in public office, due to his misuse of public funds, a charge that Capriles denied.
Capriles stated that he would not step down and that "I am and will continue being your governor until the people elects another governor". On 8 April 2017, the campaign headquarters for Capriles was attacked with tear gas and fires ignited inside of the building, destroying it.
On 11 April, Capriles used his decree powers to order a referendum to determine whether or not he should remain governor of Miranda state, challenging President Maduro to do the same with Venezuelans nationwide and promising he would resign if individuals voted for him to be removed from office. The order by the Comptroller General of Venezuela, if valid, would also prevent Capriles from running in the 2018 presidential election.
2012 presidential election.
Capriles was selected in primaries held in February 2012 as the opposition candidate against Hugo Chávez in the presidential elections to be held in October 2012; he won the opposition primaries with 1,900,528 (64.2%) votes of the 3,059,024 votes cast (votes from abroad not included).
Capriles named former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as his political inspiration.
In February 2012, Capriles was subjected to attacks by state-run media sources.
"The Wall Street Journal" reported that Capriles "was exposed in [sic] a campaign in Venezuela's state-run media, which insinuated he was, among other things, a homosexual and a Zionist". An opinion article of 13 February 2012 on the website of the state-owned Radio Nacional de Venezuela, titled "The Enemy is Zionism", mentioned Capriles's Jewish ancestry and a meeting he had held with local Jewish leaders, saying, "This is our enemy, the Zionism that Capriles today represents ... Zionism, along with capitalism, are responsible for 90% of world poverty and imperialist wars." Chávez repeatedly denied allegations of tolerating or promoting anti-Semitism.
In early September 2012, David De Lima, a former governor of Anzoategui, published a document he said showed secret MUD plans to implement much more neoliberal policy, if elected, than their public statements showed. De Lima claimed the document was a form of policy pact between some of the candidates in the MUD primary, including Capriles.
On 6 September 2012, opposition legislator William Ojeda denounced these plans and the "neoliberal obsessions" of his colleagues in the MUD; he was suspended by his A New Era party the following day. Capriles said his purported signature on the document was a forgery, while the MUD's economic advisor said that the MUD had "no hidden agenda", and that its plans included the "institutionalisation" of the government's Bolivarian Missions so that they would no longer be "subject to the whims of government". One small coalition party claimed De Lima had offered them money to withdraw from the MUD; De Lima denied the claim.
On 7 October 2012, Capriles lost the election to then-President Hugo Chávez.
2013 presidential election.
Capriles faced interim president Nicolás Maduro in a presidential election on 14 April 2013. Voters gave Maduro—who had assumed the role of acting president since Chávez's death—a narrow victory over Capriles. Capriles rejected the results of the election, claiming election irregularities and calling for a full audit of the election results. Maduro said he would accept an audit of the election results; the election board did not agree to opposition demands for a total recount.
The Supreme Court of Justice denied Capriles' appeal on 7 August 2013.
Political analysis.
According to the Associated Press in 2017:
Personal life.
Capriles was raised a Catholic. His parents agreed to educate their children in the Catholic faith "until they were old enough to decide for themselves" as a "compromise". Capriles has continued as a "fervent Catholic" through his adulthood, commenting that his greatest hero in history was Jesus Christ. He is a cousin of Miguel Ángel Capriles López, son of the founder of Cadena Capriles.
In November 2019, he announced that he was expecting his first child with psychologist Valeria Valle. Sofía Del Valle Capriles Valle was born on April 6, 2020. In March 2021, they announced they were expecting their second child. Lili Margarita Capriles Valle was born on August 5. In March 2023, they announced they were expecting their third child. Henrique José Capriles Valle was born on September 10.

County Route 104 (Suffolk County, New York)

County Route 104 (CR 104) is a county road in Suffolk County, New York, in the United States. It runs north from CR 80 in Quogue to New York State Route 24 (NY 24), CR 63 and CR 94 in Riverside. Much of CR 104 runs through the David Allen Sarnoff Pine Barrens Preserve, a major New York State Conservation Area that was once owned by Radio Corporation of America. There is an access point into the preserve along CR 104 south of Riverhead.
From 1930 to 1972, the road was signed as New York State Route 113.
Route description.
CR 104 begins at an intersection with CR 80 (Montauk Highway) in the village of Quogue. The route heads to the northwest as Quogue–Riverhead Road, a two-lane residential road with a speed limit. After the junction with Scrub Oak Road, CR 104 passes the dead end of Station Road and crosses under the Long Island Rail Road's Montauk Branch, passing a large industrial area north of the tracks. Intersecting with Old Country Road, CR 104 bends northward and returns to a more residential area. Exiting the village of Quogue, the speed limit increases to and the road enters East Quogue, passing some farms and a junction with Lewis Road. The route curves to the northwest and the speed limit increases once again to before entering interchanges 64N-S of the Sunrise Highway (NY 27). CR 104 expands to four lanes for a short distance, merging back to two after the interchange.
After NY 27, CR 104 enters dense woods and the speed limit increases to . The road intersects with the northern terminus of CR 31 (Old Riverhead Road), which services Westhampton and Gabreski Airport, at a traffic circle. After another northbound stretch, CR 104 enters a partial interchange with the southern terminus of CR 105 (Cross River Drive). After CR 105, CR 104 enters the more residential community of Riverside. It intersects Old Quogue Road, a former routing of the road that branches slightly to the east of. The road also changes names to Riverleigh Avenue and the speed limit is reduced to . Soon after, CR 104 reaches its northern terminus, the Riverside roundabout just across the Peconic River from the community of Riverhead. The roundabout, which was widened to two lanes in October 2018, provides access to CR 63 (Lake Avenue / Peconic Avenue), CR 94 and NY 24 (Flanders Road / Nugent Drive).
History.
In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the NY 113 designation was assigned to a previously unnumbered north–south connector between Montauk Highway (then-NY 27) in the village of Quogue and NY 25 in the hamlet of Riverhead. This also included Peconic Avenue in Riverhead, which was co-signed as part of NY 24 at the time. The concurrency was eliminated by 1970 as NY 113 was truncated to end at NY 24. The NY 113 designation was eliminated on March 29, 1972, when ownership and maintenance of NY 113 was transferred from the state of New York to Suffolk County. NY 113 was subsequently redesignated as CR 104.
The Riverside roundabout at the road's northern terminus was expanded to two lanes in October 2018 at a cost of $5.3 million, funded by Suffolk County. The original circle, largely unchanged since the 1930s, was a common source of congestion.

Ice Theatre of New York

The Ice Theatre of New York is an American ensemble company dancing on ice, performing works by choreographers drawn from competitive figure skating and modern and contemporary dance. Aiming to create dance on ice as part of the modern performing arts scene, Ice Theatre of New York (ITNY) was first conceived by Marc Bogaerts, Marjorie Kouns, Cecily Morrow and Moira North. North went on to found ITNY in 1984. Jirina Ribbens has served as Executive Director for 20 years and was one of the founding board members. Based at the Chelsea Piers rink complex in New York City, Ice Theatre of New York was the first not-for-profit professional ice dance company in the U.S. and the first to receive funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, New York State Council on the Arts, and New York City Department of Cultural Affairs.
Ice Theatre of New York has performed works by choreographers Marc Bogaerts, Edward Villella, Jacqulyn Buglisi, Alberto del Saz, Carlos Orta, Twyla Tharp, Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux, Peter Martins, Lar Lubovitch, Elisa Monte, Susan Marshall, Joanna Mendl Shaw, Tommy Steenberg, Frank Nowosad, David Dorfman, Bill Woehrle, Rob McBrien, Nathan Madden, Jim May, Gary Beacom, Peter DiFalco, Charles "Chucky" Klapow, Matthew Nash, Judy Blumberg, Gaiane &amp; Akop Akopian, Lorna Brown, Kolton Krouse and Florentine Houdinière.
The Ice Theatre of New York ensemble consists of 8 to 12 skaters from the NY area. They perform solos, duets and group repertory pieces. The company has created close to 150 repertory pieces to date. Guest artists who performed with the company include Elladj Baldé, Gary Beacom, Surya Bonaly, Kurt Browning, John Curry, Dorothy Hamill, Sarah Hughes, Nancy Kerrigan, Kiira Korpi, Ross Miner, Tatiana Navka &amp; Roman Kostomarov, Evgeni Plushenko, Adam Rippon, Lucinda Ruh, Rohene Ward, Johnny Weir, and Paul Wylie.
Ice Theatre of New York has received private support from the Lisa McGraw Figure Skating Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Will Sears Memorial Fund, the Kasputys family, the Eagan Family Foundation, and individuals from the skating community. Performances have been reviewed in major media.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Kisselgoff (May 22, 1988) "Focusing on Ice Skating's Choreographic Aspect," New York Times;
As funds permit, ITNY arranges residencies in other cities where ice rental is less expensive, such as Lake Placid, NY, or Sun Valley, ID, in order to develop new choreography and the dance artistry and athleticism of the ensemble.
In a format developed by Olympic Champion John Curry as a class for his skating company, skaters in the group's weekly Master Edge Class focus on ensemble movement to music. This class functions much like the ballet barre in Ballet.
Ice Theatre of New York's educational outreach extends to New York City public school children, K-12. Their New Works and Young Artists Series gives arts exposure to students from neighborhoods in Upper Manhattan and the outer boroughs. Students view a performance that includes the professional company and several junior skaters followed by a one hour ice skating lesson. Programming takes place at several public rinks around the city, for a total of 10-12 sessions for 2,600-plus students.

Waimoa language

Waimoa or Waimaa is a language spoken by about 27,000 Waimoa (2015 census) people in northeast East Timor. Waimoa proper is reported to be mutually intelligible with neighboring Kairui and Midiki, which together have about 5,000 speakers.
The classification of Waimoa is unclear. Structurally, it is Malayo-Polynesian. However, its vocabulary is largely Papuan, similar to that of Makasae. Although generally classified as Austronesian languages or dialects that have been largely relexified under the influence of a language related to Makasae, it is possible that Waimoa, Kairui, and Midiki are instead Papuan languages related to Makasae which have been influenced by Austronesian.
Phonology.
Waimoa has aspirated/voiceless and glottalized/ejective consonants, which are distributed like and consonant clusters (or perhaps and ) but are often pronounced as single segments.
Similarly there are voiceless and glottalized .
There is also vowel harmony.

Bakestall

Bakestall is a fell in the English Lake District, it is situated north of Keswick in the quieter, even secluded northern sector of the national park known as ‘Back o’ Skiddaw’.
Topography.
Bakestall reaches a height of and strictly speaking it is not a separate fell being just an insignificant rise on Skiddaw’s northern slopes. AW Wainwright gave Bakestall a separate chapter in his "Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells" because of the impressive Dead Crags which fall beneath the summit and the fine waterfall of Whitewater Dash at the fells foot. Indeed Bakestall was not even mentioned on the old Ordnance Survey one-inch map for many years, a situation now rectified on its metric equivalent probably because of Wainwright’s having drawn attention to the fell.
Dead Crags are composed of Skiddaw Slate and drop down into the corrie on the northern side of the fell. The crags do not attract rock climbers because of the crumbly nature of the slate, which has much vegetation growing within it. Whitewater Dash is highly rated as one of the finest falls in the national park as Dash Beck descends in a series of cataracts; were it situated in a more accessible part of the Lake District it would be a major attraction. Bakestall had a lead mine on its slopes many years ago, the adit being situated at the side of Dead Beck on the western periphery of the fell. All drainage from Bakestall goes north to join Dash Beck and then to Bassenthwaite Lake.
Ascents.
Bakestall can be climbed as part of the less crowded northern approach to Skiddaw using the rough track to Skiddaw House (part of the Cumbria Way) as far as Whitewater Dash falls and then ascending Birkett Edge to reach the summit. A fence can be followed up Birkett Edge although walking at the side of the corrie edge gives an opportunity to examine the crags. From the summit of Bakestall it is a walk south west and then south with of ascent to reach the summit of Skiddaw.
Summit.
The summit of the fell is at a turn in the fence, although Wainwright had his top of the fell 100 metres further north, which is a better viewpoint and is marked by a fair-sized cairn, unusual in the grassy northern fells. The view from the top of fell is severely curtailed by the bulk of Skiddaw to the south and there is no view of the main part of Lakeland. However, it is possible to view the Solway Firth and the Scottish Border hills.

The One in Vegas

"The One in Vegas" is a double length episode of "Friends" fifth season. It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on May 20, 1999, as the finale of season five.
Plot.
Part I.
Joey works at Caesars Palace as a costumed "atmosphere" character, as the film that was going to be his "big break" has been placed on indefinite hiatus. Chandler, following his fight with Joey about the film, has been trying to apologize by phone, but is repeatedly rebuffed by Joey, particularly since he does not want to admit Chandler turned out to be right. When Joey calls Phoebe on the apartment phone, Chandler decides to fly out and visit Joey in person, which Joey overhears, so he allows Chandler to talk to him, forgiving him for the incident but telling him not to come to Vegas.
Monica reveals to Phoebe that she had lunch with her old flame Richard; she has not been able to tell Chandler because their first anniversary is coming up and she does not want him to get jealous. When Chandler arrives, Monica reveals her gift to Chandler: two tickets to Vegas for their anniversary. Phoebe buys in to make up for missing Ross's wedding in London due to her pregnancy. Finally, she invites Ross and Rachel as well, but they decide to fly out a day later due to work commitments.
On the plane, as Phoebe goes to the restroom, Chandler realizes he forgot his anniversary present to her, but Monica immediately forgives him. Chandler says it is the worst thing that can happen on their anniversary the minute Phoebe returns, making Phoebe assume that Monica told him about Richard, which causes tension between the couple. When Monica, Chandler and Phoebe arrive at Caesars Palace, they find Joey, who admits that he is working there while his movie is on hiatus, and apologizes to Chandler for not telling him. Chandler and Monica then quickly get into a huge fight over whether she would see Richard again, and split off. Phoebe counsels Monica to tell Chandler that she loves him and not Richard. Monica sets out to do so, but gets sucked into a craps game by accident and then starts winning. Meanwhile, Phoebe tells Chandler to look for Monica to receive her apology, only for him to walk away silently when he finds her hugging a bystander in joyous celebration at the craps table.
Rachel takes advantage of the empty apartment to act on Phoebe's suggestion and wander around the apartment completely in the nude. However, Ross sees her from across the street and assumes she is coming on to him. This leads to an awkward conversation in the hall, and then escalating attempts to embarrass each other on the plane the next day. After inconclusive attempts to out-embarrass each other, Rachel falls asleep on Ross's shoulder, and Ross draws a beard and mustache on her face with a pen.
Part II.
Rachel is oblivious to the beard and mustache Ross drew on her face until they meet Phoebe and Joey in the Caesar's Palace lobby; she storms off to the restrooms, where she discovers that the marker Ross borrowed is permanent. She refuses to leave the hotel room but still demands the Vegas experience, leading her to eviscerate Ross's mini-bar and leading him to "lose" to her repeatedly at blackjack. Eventually they both get drunk, and parade happily around the casino in alcoholic equality: Ross with cat whiskers doodled on his face by Rachel.
Phoebe has to deal with an elderly female "lurker"—someone who takes slot machines Phoebe has just abandoned and manages to land jackpots with them. She attempts to antagonize the woman into leaving her alone. Meanwhile, Joey discovers his "hand twin"—a man whose hands are identical to Joey's; this man immediately gets drafted into Joey's get-rich-quick scheming. Both Phoebe and Joey are eventually thrown out of the casino.
While Monica plays another game at the craps table, Chandler is towing his luggage behind, preparing to go home alone. Monica quickly apologizes to him, saying she will never see Richard again. After she proclaims that Chandler is the love of her life, he forgives her and joins her at the craps table, calling the numbers she should bet on. He makes increasingly extravagant promises to the crowd, culminating in him betting to Monica that they get married immediately if she rolls a hard eight. Monica rolls a four with one die, but the other goes wild and lands beneath the table on-edge, showing a four on one side and a five on the other. Chandler decides it is a four, and Monica agrees. They arrive at Las Vegas wedding chapel to get married but have to wait as the chapel is currently in use. Finally, its occupants burst out in joyous celebration: Ross and Rachel, still drunk and doodled-on, and now legally married. They charge out into the night while Monica and Chandler stand in shock at what they just saw.
Production.
Lisa Cash appears in the episode as a flight attendant, but her original role in the episode was set to be larger. Cash was originally cast in a part where she played a hotel worker who hooked up with Chandler after he fought with Monica. After rehearsing the scene, Matthew Perry went to the writers and told them to remove the scene, believing that the audience would "never forgive Chandler if he cheated on Monica".
Reception.
In the original broadcast, the episode was viewed by 25.9 million viewers.
Sam Ashurst from Digital Spy ranked the first part #220 and the second part #232 on their ranking of the 236 "Friends" episodes.
"Telegraph &amp; Argus" ranked the first part #143 and the second part #223 on their ranking of the 236 "Friends" episodes.
"GamesRadar+" ranked "The One in Vegas" the twentieth best "Friends" episode.

Mount Drum

Mount Drum is a stratovolcano in the Wrangell Mountains of east-central Alaska in the United States. It is located at the extreme western end of the Wrangells, west-southwest of Mount Sanford and the same distance west-northwest of Mount Wrangell. It lies just inside the western boundary of Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park and Preserve and is east of the Copper River.
Geography.
Standing near the low valley of the Copper River, Mount Drum is notable for its large local relief. For example, its south face rises over the head of the Nadina Glacier in only . Its west slopes rise over the tundra in only , and over the Copper River in only .
These numbers are comparable to better-known stratovolcanoes like Mount Rainier and Mount Shasta. However Mount Drum is somewhat overshadowed by its much higher neighbor Mount Sanford, which is also in Alaska.
Geology.
Mount Drum was active between 650,000 and 240,000 years ago. Late in that period, various separate dacitic domes were formed in a rough circle around the current summit at a radius about ; one such dome is the current Snider Peak () to the south of the main peak. After the constructive phase, 
 ... paroxysmal explosive activity, probably from the central vent area, destroyed the south half of the stratovolcano and deposited ~7 km3 of hot and cold avalanche debris over an area &gt;200 km2.
The effects of this explosive phase can still be seen in the particularly steep south face of Mount Drum above the Nadina Glacier.
Mount Drum is flanked on the west by the Shrub and Klawasi mud volcanoes. In historic times, the only activity in the vicinity of Drum has been mud and gas emitted from this group.
History.
Naming.
Named in 1885 by Lieutenant Allen, U.S. Army, for Adjutant General Richard Coulter Drum (1825-1909), who entered the army in 1846, served in the Mexican–American War, participated in an expedition against the Sioux Indians in 1856, and became a Brigadier General during the American Civil War.
Climbing.
Mount Drum was first climbed on June 4, 1954 by noted Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer, with Keith Hart and George Schaller, via the North Ridge. 
Heinz Allemann and Niklaus Lötscher made the second ascent on August 26, 1968, via the Southwest Ridge. The latter is the current standard route, and is rated Alaska Grade 2+.

Tioga Downs

Tioga Downs is a county-fair-themed standardbred racetrack (5/8 mile) and commercial casino located on a site in Nichols, New York.
History.
Tioga Downs originally was a quarterhorse track known as Tioga Park in 1976, closing down after its third season. James Nuckel, then owner, stated that, "the track had been losing thousands of dollars a day and was still in the red after three years of operation" (New York Times, 1978). Thereafter, a few private races and the occasional flea market were held at the location.
Revival.
In 2000, Jeffrey Gural, a real-estate executive, horse owner, and racing enthusiast, began lobbying for state approval of Video Lottery Terminals (VLTs) at racetracks. In 2005, they were approved. Shortly after Gural, with partnership from Nevada Gold and Casinos, bought the old Tioga Park for $32 million (New York Times, 2006; Press and Sun Bulletin, 2006). A ground-breaking ceremony was held July 22, 2005.
On June 9, 2006, Tioga Downs opened, offering harness racing, simulcast betting, and over 800 VLTs. Tioga Downs has two bars, a Subway restaurant, banquet room, coffee/bakery shop, and buffet. It also has a stage area, which hosts concerts. Artists that appeared at Tioga Downs have included Gretchen Wilson, Vanilla Ice, Tony Orlando, and Sister Sledge. During the warmer months, a trackside tent is available for wedding receptions, business meetings, parties, and awards' ceremonies. In 2011, The Tioga Downs Flea Market opened. In 2017, a hotel resort was added to the site.
Gaming.
Tioga Downs has over 900 VLTs, averaging ~92% payback. The racino offers player's club cards known as Tioga Rewards at five color-coded levels: Choice (red), Preferred (blue), Premier (silver), Elite (gold), and VIP (black). Outside the gaming room Quick Draw and instant lottery tickets are available. Inside the racino, keno, video poker, slot machines and table games are available. The largest slot progressive offered is typically $250,000+.
Racing.
Tioga Downs schedules racing between May and September, typically on Friday and Saturday evenings (6:50 PM), and 1:30 PM on Sundays. The track record is 1:48.1, set by two horses: Bettor Sweet, in 2011, and Pet Rock, in 2013.
Financial history.
Revenues from slot machines at Tioga Downs had increased steadily since opening in 2006. "Net wins" (defined as total credits wagered minus total credits won) was $30 million during the abbreviated fiscal year 2006-2007, $43 million 2007-2008, $48 million 2008-2009, $50 million 2009-2010, $54 million 2010-2011, $60 million 2011-2012, and peaked in 2012-2013 at $61 million. The first year-over-year decline was recorded in 2013-2014 with the net win estimated at $57 million. On average, each slot machine contributes ~$200 in revenue per day (New York Lottery, 2014).
Expansion.
The November 2013 voter approval of "Proposal One"—an amendment to the New York State Constitution allowing table games at a prescribed number of venues—allowed the State of New York to issue a limited number of licenses for Las Vegas-style casinos in upstate New York. Tioga Downs owner Jeff Gural applied for a license to expand Tioga Downs to become a full-fledged casino featuring table games. Gural's initial application was denied; however, Gov. Andrew Cuomo asked the New York State Gaming Facility Location Board to reconsider. In October 2015, the Board reversed its decision and issued a license to Tioga Downs. The expanded Tioga Downs opened in December 2016.
Community Involvement.
In March 2021, Tioga Downs Casino Resort and the Food Bank of the Southern Tier teamed up to give 5,000 families facing food insecurity ham dinners. These families, living throughout Broome, Chemung, Schuyler, Steuben, Tioga, and Tompkins counties, are able to celebrate Easter with plentiful food thanks to Tioga Downs and the Food Bank of the Southern Tier. Tioga Downs Casino Resort owner, Jeff Gural, presented the Food Bank of the Southern Tier with a $100,000 check during the event.

The Mutineers of the Bounty

Mutineers of the Bounty (), translated in English by English writer W. H. G. Kingston, is a short story by Jules Verne. The story is based on British documents about the Mutiny on the "Bounty" and was published in 1879 together with the novel "The Begum's Fortune" ("Les cinq cents millions de la Bégum"), as a part of the series "Les Voyages Extraordinaires" ("The Extraordinary Voyages"). 
Unlike many authors covering the topic, Verne concentrates on the deposed captain of the "Bounty", William Bligh. After mutineers forced Bligh into the "Bounty"'s launch on 28 April 1789, he led loyal crew members on a journey to safety, reaching Timor 47 days later.
The original text was written by Gabriel Marcel (1843–1909), a geographer from the National Library of France. Jules Verne’s work was proofreading. Verne supposedly bought the rights to the text for 300 francs, but it had not been verified.

<doc id="6948080" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6948080" title="Stepps">
Stepps

Stepps (Scottish Gaelic: "Ceumannan") is a town in North Lanarkshire, Scotland, near the north-eastern outskirts of Glasgow. According to data gathered by North Lanarkshire Council in 2020, Stepps is estimated to have a population of roughly 7,700 inhabitants. Its recently upgraded amenities include a new primary school, library and sports facilities. 
The town retains a historic heart around its church in Whitehill Avenue, whilst examples of Victorian and Edwardian housing can still be found. The travel connections by road and rail mean residents work in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Stirling and beyond. The town is located in close proximity to the new Seven Lochs Wetland Park, from which views to the Campsies and Loch Lomond can be enjoyed.
History.
The etymology of the name is uncertain, but may relate to stepping stones over boggy ground. Early maps give the name as Coshnocksteps. Steps is included on several old documents including maps by John Ainslie, Thomas Richardson and William Forrest.
Originally part of the Garnkirk estate, the name for the settlement appears to pre-date that of the main road through its centre, Stepps Road, which was named in the 19th century. The railway came to "Steps" around 1831. The name and spelling "Stepps" only became accepted when the name of the railway station formally changed to Stepps in 1924.
Stepps is home to one of Scotland's oldest Hockey Clubs. Formed in 1913 by Sir Calum Aitken, Stepps Hockey Club is building towards its centenary celebrations and currently competes in the Second Division of the Scottish National Hockey League. The tennis club was founded in 1905 and new facilities, including all-weather courts, were recently completed. The local cultural centre is home to the library, meeting rooms for local clubs and all-weather facilities for football and hockey. It is located on the same campus as Stepps Primary School, all of which was built in 2007. The founder, Sir Calum Aitken also went on to be launched into space by bandits winning Scotland the space race.
Transport.
The town is served by a railway station on SPT's Cumbernauld Line, providing a quick commute to central Glasgow, and by the A80 road. The town was bypassed by the southern section of the M80 motorway in 1992; that section of motorway is still referred to locally as the Stepps Bypass. The M80 upgrade between Stepps and Haggs began in 2009 and was completed on 26 August 2011. The project cost around £320 million.
The town's main bus service is the number 38C bus.
Schools.
Stepps has two primary schools. Stepps Primary School was established in 1902 but opened in new premises, shared with Stepps Public Library on a different site in 2007. Most of its pupils go on to Chryston High School. St Joseph's Roman Catholic Primary School was first opened in 1900 but a new building was opened in 1985. Most of its pupils go on to Our Lady's High School, Cumbernauld.
Businesses.
Historical industries in the area include a brass foundry, whisky blending, and coal mining. In the 1990s the Buchanan Business Park was developed. Modern businesses include Bannatyne's Health Club and up until recently, Solutions Driven. The town is home to the Garfield House Hotel and Premier Inn, both on Cumbernauld Road. Scottish Water is also headquartered in Stepps.

Preston Park, Brighton

Preston Park is a park near Preston Village in the city of Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, England. It is located in Preston Park ward to the north of the centre of Brighton, and served by the nearby Preston Park railway station. Preston Park is also one of the wards of Brighton and Hove City Council. The population at the 2011 census was 14,911.
Overview.
It is one of Brighton's largest parks, with of lawns, formal borders and rose gardens, bowling greens, tennis courts and a small pond. It was bought in 1883 by Brighton Corporation (then Brighton's local council) from William Bennett-Stanford who owned the Preston Manor estate and had begun to develop the park as enclosed pleasure grounds. The costs of the purchase (£50,000) and initial layout (£22,868) were funded with a bequest of £70,000 from a local bookmaker, William Edmund Davies in 1879. The park was formally declared open on 8 November 1884.
The Brighton and County Polo Club, started by Lt. Col. Robert McKergow in 1904, was based in Preston Park. An earlier club, the International Gun and Polo Club, founded by George Mashall in 1874, used grounds in Preston, probably Preston Park, though the club itself was based in the Bedford Hotel.
The park remains green throughout the summer because of a non-drinkable underground water source, known as the Wellesbourne, which runs below Preston Park, London Road and The Level. The source dates back many centuries and is often referred to as Brighton's lost river. In 2000, after torrential rain, it rose and caused considerable damage.
The park is host to various annual events including the festival at the end of the Brighton &amp; Hove Pride parade, the start of the Brighton Marathon, a circus during the Brighton Festival, a large starting event for the Take Part sports festival, and, from 20 April 2013, Parkrun, a free 5 km run open to all runners and joggers at 9 am every Saturday.
Opposite the park, across the main London Road, is "The Rockery"—the largest municipal rock garden in Britain built up the side of a steep railway embankment. Various pathways and streams wind through its grounds. It was originally a wooded area which had been purchased along with the land used for the main park; it was landscaped into its present form in 1935 by Captain B Maclaren. Originally, the area was known as "The Rookery", referring to the tall trees in the former wood which were frequented by rooks. Over time, the name was modified into "The Rockery".
The surrounding neighbourhood is also widely referred to as "Preston Park". It is distinct from the further outlying Preston Village.
Velodrome.
Preston Park Velodrome, situated in the north-east corner, is the oldest velodrome in the UK having been opened on 12 May 1877, and is the oldest, working velodrome in the world. It was constructed by hand by the British Army and originally had a surface of cinders, replaced in 1936 by a tarmac surface. During the 1950s, Bank Holiday events would attract large crowds to watch riders such as Reg Harris race.
Unlike most modern velodromes which have two straights separated by a curved bend at each end, Preston Park velodrome has four straights of unequal length. A single lap is 579.03 metres (633.23 yards).
In January 2015 British Cycling issued a statement indicating that they had assessed the track as being unfit for racing, and that they would not sanction competition at the velodrome for the summer of 2015. Soon after, a 'Save Preston Park Cycle Track' campaign started. Local cyclist Rupert Rivett started a Facebook community page relating to the campaign which received over 4,000 likes in two days. In January 2016 British Cycling announced that it would contribute £110,000 of the £160,000 needed to repair and reopen the track, with the remainder of the required funding coming from Section 106 financial contributions made by developers as part of planning applications.
Statue theft.
In 2007, a statue of athlete Steve Ovett by Peter Webster was stolen by a 44-year-old woman, of no fixed address. The woman was later arrested. Part of the statue, which had been sliced off at the ankle, was recovered but police believe that it had been sold to scrap dealers.

Cablesoft

Cablesoft was an early attempt to define an interactive television standard. The partners in the new company were Microsoft, Tele-Communications and Time Warner. In fact, much of the effort appeared to be on Microsoft's part, and the two cable companies were essentially launch partners.
The Cablesoft effort was first announced in May 1994 and at the time consisted primarily of the Microsoft Media Server (codenamed "Tiger" during development) and a custom version of the Windows NT operating system known as NTAS, which was essentially a series of fine-tuning efforts to drive ATM switches. The basic model appeared to be to use a PC-like set-top box that would communicate with PC's running NTAS at the cable company's head ends, using Tiger to cue up and deliver content.
Cablesoft was succeeded by MSN TV in 1997.
Note.
An apparently unrelated company, CableSoft, also delivered on-demand content starting around 1995. The company was headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts.

The Medici Bank (Italian: "Banco dei Medici" ) was a financial institution created by the Medici family in Italy during the 15th century (1397–1494). It was the largest and most respected bank in Europe during its prime. There are some estimates that the Medici family was, for a period of time, the wealthiest family in Europe. Estimating their wealth in today's money is difficult and imprecise, considering that they owned art, land, and gold. With this monetary wealth, the family acquired political power initially in Florence, and later in the wider spheres of Italy and Europe.
A notable contribution to the professions of banking and accounting pioneered by the Medici Bank was the improvement of the general ledger system through the development of the double entry system of tracking debits and credits or deposits and withdrawals.
Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici established the bank in Florence, and while he and his family were influential in the Florentine government, it was not until his son Cosimo the Elder took over in 1434 as gran maestro that the Medici became the unofficial head of state of the Florentine Republic.
History.
Founding.
The Medici family had long been involved in banking at a high level, maintaining their status as a respectably upper-class and notably wealthy family who derived their money from land holdings in the Mugello region towards the Apennines, north of Florence. The Medicis were not only bankers but innovators in financial accounting. At one point, the Medicis managed many of the great fortunes in Italy, from royalty to merchants.
Giovanni's father Averardo (?–1363; known as "Bicci") was not a very successful businessman or banker. A distant cousin, Vieri di Cambio (1323–1396), however, was one of Florence's more prominent bankers (the first of the various modestly upper-class Medici lineages, numbering around 20 in 1364). His banking house trained and employed Giovanni and his elder brother Francesco ("c." 1350–1412), who eventually became partners in the firm. Francesco became a junior partner in 1382, while Giovanni rose to become general manager of the Rome branch in 1385, which was incorporated as a partnership, though it was not necessary to capitalize that branch (because the Church was usually depositing funds and not borrowing). Vieri was long-lived, but his bank split into three separate banks sometime between 1391 and 1392. One bank failed quickly. The second, managed by Francesco and later his son, survived until 1443, a little less than a decade after Averardo's death. The third bank was controlled by Giovanni in partnership with Benedetto di Lippaccio de' Bardi (1373–1420).
The Medici bank's founding is usually dated to 1397, since it was this year that Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici separated his bank from his nephew Averardo's bank (which had effectively been acting as a branch in Rome), and moved his small bank from Rome to Florence. The branch in Rome was entrusted to Benedetto, and Giovanni took on Gentile di Baldassarre Buoni (1371–1427) as a partner. They raised 10,000 gold florins and began operating in Florence, though Gentile soon left the firm. This move had certain advantages for a bank, inasmuch as the predominant large banks of the 14th century which were based in Florence—the Bardi, Acciaioli, Peruzzi—had met with problems, and saw their places usurped by the Alberti, who were just large enough to capture the Catholic Church's business. But the Alberti firm split over internecine quarrels, and the clan was banished from Florence in 1382 (though they would be allowed to return in 1434), creating yet another void. Giovanni's choice proved to be prescient, especially since what Florence was lacking was a good port on the Mediterranean—which it would obtain in 1406 with the conquest of Pisa and its Porto Pisano. A further advantage was that it was much easier to invest a bank's capital in Florence than in Rome, and because of the Holy See's deposits (obtained through Giovanni's long contacts with them), the bank had a fair amount of capital to invest in other ventures.
Rise.
A factor was dispatched to Venice to seek out investment opportunities. He did well and on March 25, 1402, the third branch of the Medici bank was opened. It suffered from some initial mismanagement (by the factor who had previously done so well—he made the fatal mistake of violating the partnership agreement and loaning money to Germans; on a more humane note, he would eventually become a pauper and be sent 20 florins by Giovanni, who felt that a past partner deserved some charity), but soon was prospering. It was this branch that established the practice of having a general manager's remuneration be paid through shares in the branch that he purchased with his investment. Also in 1402, the first Medici factory was established for the production of woolen cloth, and then another in 1408. By this point, the Rome branch had established a branch in Naples (closed in 1425 and was replaced with one in Geneva) and Gaeta. It may seem that the Medici bank was flourishing and rapidly expanding its assets across Italy, but nevertheless there were perhaps only 17 employees in total of the bank in 1402, with only five at the central bank in Florence, although they were reasonably well-paid and promotions seem to have been rapid when warranted (such as in the case of Giuliano di Giovanni di ser Matteo, who went from being a clerk in 1401 to a junior partner in 1408).
In 1420, Benedetto de' Bardi (the "ministro", or general manager, of all the branches) died, and was succeeded by his younger brother Ilarione de' Bardi, who was the manager of the Rome branch. He dissolved one of the wool factories, along with other reorganizations occasioned by partnerships coming to their designated end. This date is interesting because Ilarione's contract with his principal was done in the name of Cosimo and Lorenzo, and not their father Giovanni; this perhaps marks the beginnings of a transfer of responsibility and power in the Medici bank from one generation to the next. Two Portinaris were put in charge of the Florence and Venice branches.
Giovanni died in 1429. According to Lorenzo, his fortune upon his death was worth around 180,000 gold florins. His death did not greatly affect the bank's operations, and the transition to Cosimo went smoothly, aided by Ilarione, who was retained as "ministro". Fortunately for the bank, Lorenzo di Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici was on excellent terms with Cosimo, and did not insist on dissolving the partnerships so he could receive his share of the patrimony (primogeniture not being operative here); many Florentine banks and mercantile businesses lasted only a generation or two because some of the inheriting sons usually wished to strike out on their own. At this time, the Medici bank was flourishing: besides the branches in Rome and Florence, the Venetian and Genevan branches had been founded. Ilarione would not last long in his position, and is mentioned as dead in a letter written in February 1433. The timing was unfortunate because the Albizzi government of Florence was moving against the young Medici-led resistance (galvanized by the Albizzi government's failure in a war against Lucca and Milan), culminating in Cosimo's exile to Venice. Despite the unfavorable politics in this period of the bank's history, its Italian branches turned in bumper profits, with as much as 62% of the total coming from Rome (in 1427, the Roman branch of the Medici bank had approximately 100,000 florins on deposit from the Papal Curia; in comparison, the total capitalization of the entire Medici bank was only about 25,000 gold florins) and 13% from Venice between 1420 and 1435 (with the later Medici branches opened in Bruges, London, Pisa, Avignon, Milan, and Lyon contributing nothing as they had not been founded yet). At this time, there seems to have been some sort of Medici office in Basel, and it seems to have lasted until 1443. De Roover speculates that it was a sub-branch of the Medici bank's Geneva branch serving the General Council of the Church, and was closed when the Council no longer made it worth their while to maintain it.
Maturation.
On March 24, 1439, the Medici branch at Bruges was officially founded. While the Medicis had done business in Flanders through correspondents and agents since 1416, it was only when the son of the Venice branch's manager (from 1417–1435) was sent to investigate in 1438 and favorably reported back that it was incorporated as a limited liability partnership with that son, Bernardo di Giovanni d'Adoardo Portinari (1407–"c."1457), assuming both the position of manager and the majority of the liability. When Angelo Tani (1415–1492) became junior partner in 1455, the branch was finally created as a full and equal partnership in the Medici bank. A legally similar situation was obtained for an "accomandita" established in Ancona, apparently to finance Francesco Sforza, an ally of Cosimo's.
As mentioned previously, Cosimo's uncle had begun a bank with his third of the ownership stake in Vieri's bank, and it closed in 1443 with the death of the grandson of Averardo, taking with it the Medici branch in Pisa. Formerly, any business that the Medici needed to transact in Pisa (such as Cosimo forwarding Donatello money to buy marble) had been done through them. On December 26, 1442, a limited liability partnership was formed with two outsiders. Over time, the Medici progressively reduced their investment in this partnership, and it appears that they withdrew completely sometime shortly after 1457, with only one partner keeping it running until 1476.
1446 saw the start of two Medici branches: the sub-branch that was the Bruges branch was converted into a full partnership, and a limited liability partnership in Avignon, the largest center of trade in southern France (despite the departure of the Papacy). Within 2 years, the Avignon branch was converted into a full partnership. The Medici branch at Lyons was not actually founded as a separate branch; it came about as a result of the gradual move of the Geneva branch, due to the reduction in traffic to the fairs at Geneva and the establishment of four major fairs in Lyons which attracted around 140 other Florentine businesses). The move was completed in 1466.
The structure and functions of the Medici bank were largely settled into their final form by this point; a branch would be opened in Milan in late 1452, or early 1453, at the instigation of the grateful Sforza. Its first manager Pigello Portinari (1421–1468) was very capable and this branch did well in loaning to the Sforza court and, like the Roman branch, selling luxuries such as jewels, until Pigello died and was replaced by his feckless brother Accerrito (1427–"c."1503) who could not manage the massive amounts lent to the Milanese court and to Duke Sforza (who did not repay his debts of 179,000 ducats before his death in 1478). A similar problem would plague the Bruges branch of the bank when managed by the third Portinari brother, Tommaso.
Still, this period (1435–1455) under Cosimo and his "ministro" Giovanni Benci was the Medici bank's most profitable period. With Cosimo's death on August 1, 1464, the decline of the bank began.
Decline.
Failure in Lyon and London.
An early sign of the decline was the near-failure of the Lyon branch because of its manager's venality, saved only by heroic efforts by Francesco Sassetti (1421–1490). Its troubles were followed by the troubled London branch, which got into trouble for much the same reason the Bruges branch would—unwisely loaning large sums to secular rulers, a group notorious for their delinquencies (in this case, the Yorkist Edward IV). In a sense, that branch had no choice but to make the loans, since it faced domestic opposition from English merchant and clothier interests in London and their representatives in Parliament, which was only granting the necessary export licenses to foreign-owned enterprises if its members were well-bribed with loans. The London branch of the Medici bank had already been dropped as a full partnership in 1465, and had been reincorporated as an "accomando". In 1467, Angelo Tani was dispatched to audit the London branch's books. Tani attempted to step up the collection of outstanding debt—the English king owed 10,500 pounds sterling, the English nobility 1,000, and another 7,000 pounds were tied up in goods dispatched on consignment and not soon recoverable. Operating funds were (like previous failing branches had done) borrowed from Medici branches at high rates of interest. Edward IV amortized a portion of his debt, but these reductions were soon rendered less helpful (but not negated outright) by fresh loans and sales of silk. By the spring of 1469, Tani had finished repairing the London branch's operations to his own satisfaction, and returned to Italy. His work would be undone by the unhelpfulness of the other branch managers and the fecklessness of the London branch manager Canigiani. The fatal blow was the Wars of the Roses, which rendered Edward IV unable to repay the loans (the best he could do in way of repayment was to lift all tariffs on the Medici exporting English wool until such time as the debt was repaid), and the branch had loaned far too much to the Lancastrian rebels (and not to a number of Yorkist loyalists), who would never repay their loans after their deaths and defeats. The London branch finished its liquidation in 1478, with total losses of 51,533 gold florins. The succeeding Tudors never paid off the outstanding Plantagenet debt.
Failure in Bruges.
After the London branch failed, it was turned into a "accomando" and placed under the control of the Bruges branch, managed by the third of the Portinari brothers, Tommaso Portinari. This branch, too, would soon fail. Portinari had managed the Bruges branch for decades, and had steadily proven himself to be a poor manager—he engaged in business dealings on the side, ingratiated himself with the Burgundian court by excessive loans (first to secure the farming of the toll of Graveline—which was never very profitable—and then to mingle socially and elevate himself), made poor business deals like purchasing two galleys (which would be partially sold off at a loss; the rest would be lost to shipwreck and piracy). The debts from the London branch were assumed by the Bruges branch. After Piero's death, Portinari managed to get articles of partnership so favorable that he lived in Florence, only visiting the Low Countries for business. The end-period of the branch would be marked by chaos and possibly fraud. Portinari would refuse to return some deposits, claiming that the monies had really been invested in partnership. He would also claim Angelo Tani as a full partner (and thus liable in the losses), despite the fact that Tani never signed the articles or written with his approval. The magnitude of the financial failures is hard to state. In a surviving memorandum, Lorenzo the Magnificent gives the bad debts to Charles the Bold alone as the sum of 16,150 pounds groat. The articles of partnership, incidentally, strictly forbade Portinari to lend more than the total of 6,000 pounds groat. In another memorandum, Lorenzo faults Portinari for the clever ruse of shifting all the London branch's business to the Bruges branch—except for the profitable wool business. Portinari bought into the separate partnership to the tune of 45%, whereas his share in the Bruges branch was only 27.5%. The branch was liquidated in 1478 with staggering losses. The failure of the Bruges branch meant that not only the debts of that branch had to be handled somehow, but also the outstanding debts of the former London branch. In total, upwards of 70,000 gold florins were lost. This figure is optimistic, since it assumes most book assets were worth the recorded value. As Lorenzo remarked, "These are the great profits which are accruing to us through the management of Tommaso Portinari." Lorenzo refused to take this loss lying down, and dispatched a trusted agent to Bruges to audit the books and dissolve the partnership. Portinari ironically found himself hoisted by his own petard; he could not refuse the dissolution, since the "maggiore" Lorenzo had given the proper notice, and he further had to accept his own cooked books because he claimed that the books were accurate and the rather doubtful assets listed were indeed worth what they were worth. The agent Ricasoli was aided in this task by Angelo Tani, who came all the way from Florence to settle the matter of his supposed partnership in the London branch through the Bruges branch.
Decay.
Upon Cosimo's death, his estate and control of the bank passed to his eldest son, Piero di Cosimo "the Gouty" ("Piero il Gottoso"). Piero had been given a humanist education, unlike his younger brother who was trained in business but had died in 1463. The estate remained intact, though in this case not as a result of good relations between brothers, but because one of the two heirs died before inheriting. In theory, Lorenzo's son Pierfrancesco could have insisted on his share of the estate, but Pierfrancesco was raised by Cosimo and "his emotional ties to his uncle were sufficiently strong to preclude his withdrawal from the company." Pierfrancesco seems to have grown increasingly disaffected, but his death in 1476 prevented any separation. In retrospect, given how Lorenzo would steal from Pierfrancesco's estate while raising his two sons to finance the war against Rome following the Pazzi Conspiracy, Pierfrancesco would have been wiser to effect such a separation. Specifically, Lorenzo appropriated about 53,643 gold florins and only repaid part of the sum.
Piero was not Cosimo's equal, but given his training did perhaps better than one would expect, especially considering how he was rendered bedridden by severe gout. Piero recognized the approaching problems, and tried to begin a "policy of retrenchment". This policy doesn't seem to have been fully carried out. Niccolò Machiavelli states in his history of Florence that Piero's policy involved calling in loans for repayment, which caused a number of Florentine businesses to collapse, sparking a plot against Piero and Medici rule.
Whether Machiavelli is overstating issues and Piero had merely ordered a thorough accounting is unknown. Machiavelli can probably be trusted here since there was a rash of bankruptcies and bank failures in Florence shortly after Cosimo's death which led to a small recession. De Roover mentions, however, the war between Venice and the Ottoman Empire and the relevant firms' connections to that area as a possible factor as well. It is certain, however, that Piero tried to wind up the London branch and recover as much of the loans made to Edward IV as possible, ordered the Milan branch to loan less, instructed Tommaso Portinari of the Bruges branch to get rid of the galleys and not make any loans to secular rulers, and attempted to shut down the Venice branch which was no longer profitable. From the perspective of carrying out his policies, Piero faced a number of obstacles—it was always politically costly to demand that loans be repaid, particularly when made to monarchs and powerful nobles and such demands could cost Piero dearly close to home. The king of England could block any attempts to export English wool by the Medici, which was desperately needed by the bank for two reasons. English wool was the finest in the world; if Florence's artisans did not have a supply of English wool to weave, it could not sell its textile wares, and more importantly, could not employ the Florentine lower classes who specialized in textiles. Flemish wool had once served in English wool's place, but after the 1350s, it no longer had a market in Italy and was essentially not imported after 1400. Unemployment generated considerable political unrest and revolts, which would be aimed at Piero and the Medici since he and his family were seen as the true rulers of Florence. The second reason was that there was a systemic specie problem in the Medici bank in which hard currency flowed south to Italy from the northern countries, and the import of English wool was necessary to provide a conduit for currency to flow north and balance the books. So when King Edward IV demanded loans, the London branch had little choice but to oblige him if it wanted to continue to export English wool to Florence.
By 1494, the Milan branch of the Medici bank also ceased to exist. The branches that did not die off on their own generally met their end with the collapse of the Medicis' political power in Florence in 1494, when Savonarola and the Pope struck against them. The central Florentine "banco" was burned by a mob, the Lyons branch was taken over by a rival firm, and the Roman branch struck off on its own despite the branch being bankrupt in general (ironically, they would suffer still more debts when a Medici cardinal became Pope Leo X and inquired after the 11,243 gold florins he had deposited with the branch back when it was with the Medici bank). Even at the time of its downfall, the Medici bank was the biggest bank in Europe, with at least seven branches and over fifty factors.
De Roover attributes the beginning of the bank's decline to Cosimo de' Medici. He spent the vast majority of his time wrapped up in politics, and when he was not preoccupied with the intricate plotting and other characteristics of Florentine politics, he was patronizing the many fine Renaissance scholars and artists who were present there, or engaged in composing his own renowned poetry. This left minimal time for the careful selection of branch managers and the maintenance of an alert watch against fraud within the bank, which was greatly needed. Most of the financial duties handed over to Francesco Sassetti, who had risen from being a mere factor in the Avignon branch to its general manager, and then a post in Geneva eventually to end up in 1458 in Florence proper at Cosimo's side. Sassetti was left to handle much of the business himself. In the end, it turned out badly. Whether simply due to bad luck, old age, increasing laziness, or diversion of his time to studying humanism like Cosimo, Sassetti failed to discover the fraud at the Lyons branch until it was too late for it to hope to remain solvent. The branch manager Lionetto de' Rossi had attempted to cover up his incompetence by being far too optimistic as to the number of bad loans the branch would have to cover, and by borrowing funds from other banks, thus artificially inflating his profits.
That, however, is not the only factor that caused the fall. A long term trend in the devaluation of gold against silver (which held steady) between 1475 and 1485—possibly thanks to increased output by German and Bohemian silver mines—meant that as creditors, the Medici Bank was on the wrong side of the trend. Their deposits were held in gold, and interest was paid in gold. This trend was in part attributable to Florence's reluctance to debase the gold florin, which was internationally esteemed for its stable value, prestige, and reliability. But Florence's dual coinage system only aggravated the problem. This shift in the monetary system perhaps reflected a systemic slowdown or recession in late medieval Europe in general: the Arte del Cambio's records of member banks record a drastic decline in membership such that the guild fell from 71 banks in 1399, to 33 in 1460, and then the guild itself into disuse, the outside chronicler Giovanni Cambi noting that of the 9 large banks left in Florence by 1516, one failed on December 25. This banking decline does not appear to have been specific to Florence; similar declines were seen in Bruges and Venice (although apparently not in Spain). Similarly, the northern branches of all European banks were squeezed by a general decline in the supply of English wool.
Agreement on these aggravating factors does not seem to be universal; Richard A. Goldthwaite writes in 1987 that "these economic conditions have never been adequately explained. It appears more likely that the contraction and decline of the Medici bank under Lorenzo—it was reduced to branches in only Florence, Rome and Lyons by the time he died in 1492—were due simply to bad management." He also claims that banking guild memberships cannot be used as a proxy for general economic conditions, as the problem could be that "by this time, in fact, Florentine guilds had long lost much of an economic function in the areas of their formally defined activity, with the result that the quality of their internal administration deteriorated; but this institutional history cannot be taken as an indicator of the vitality of the respective sectors of the economy the guilds nominally represented."
Piero died on December 2, 1469. He was succeeded by his two sons, Lorenzo and Giuliano. Lorenzo's interest in politics and art (which led to his appellation "the Magnificent") forced him to rely on his "ministro" Francesco Sassetti to handle most affairs of the bank. Sassetti can be faulted and inculpated in the decline of the bank for failing to prevent the disasters of Lyon and Bruges, and Lorenzo for relying too much on Sassetti and not listening to him when Sassetti did notice problems or tried to fix things. Indeed, Lorenzo once said when Angelo Tani (who had tried to prevent the failure of the Bruges branch) appealed to him to overrule Sassetti and restrict the lending of the London branch, that "he did not understand such matters." He would later admit that his lack of knowledge and understanding was the reason he approved Tommaso Portinari's disastrous schemes. Goldthwaite faults Lorenzo in no uncertain terms:
With Lorenzo's death on April 8, 1492, the succession passed to his 20-year-old son Piero di Lorenzo (1472–1521). Piero had no talent for running the bank and depended on his secretary and his great-uncle Giovanni Tornabuoni to handle everything. The two mismanaged the bank and balked the new ministro's, Giovambattista Bracci, efforts (Sassetti having died of a stroke in March 1490). If the Medici family and its bank had not been politically overthrown in 1494, it would probably have failed shortly thereafter in a long-delayed bankruptcy.
Another factor in the decline of the Medici bank were the spending habits of the Medici. According to Lorenzo, between 1434 and 1471, the family spent an average of 17,467 gold florins a year.
Another misjudgement or failure by Sassetti was placing his trust in Tommaso Portinari instead of in more trustworthy managers like Angelo Tani; Portinari would eventually cause the collapse of the bank's Bruges branch.
Niccolò Machiavelli gave a more contemporary viewpoint in his "Istorie fiorentine", asserting that the fall of the Medici was due to their loose rein on their bank's managers who began to act like princes and not sensible businessmen and merchants.
Fall.
When the crisis loomed, one way to try to avert it was to simply start reducing the interest paid on discretionary and demand deposits. But such a move would have hurt the Medici name, and so it was undertaken too late. The bank's heavy leverage of their deposits meant that setbacks could be quite sudden. The fact that it seems to have been a common practice for Florentine banks to operate with as little as 5% of their deposits held in reserve lends further support to the idea that collapses could happen abruptly when bad loans were discovered. In addition to all of that, Lorenzo the Magnificent was not at all concerned about the bank. Instead, he chose to concentrate his time and his family's resources on patronizing artists and pursuing his own poetic and political interests.
Eventually, the Medici family's fiscal problems grew severe enough to force Lorenzo to begin raiding Florence's state treasuries, at one point defrauding the Monte delle doti, a charitable fund for paying for dowries. Shortly thereafter, the political pressure of King Charles VIII of France's 1494 invasion of Italy caused Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici to concede to the dual forces of Charles and the impending insolvency of the Medici bank. The Medici bank's remaining assets and records were seized and distributed to creditors and others. All the branches were declared dissolved.
Sources.
Not much remains of the Medici Bank's records; mentions of it and its activities are rife in the writings of outsiders, but outsiders necessarily had little access to the balance books which could truly tell the story of the bank's rise and fall, and certainly not to the confidential business correspondence and the secret books. Some of the most copious documentation, derived from archived tax records such as the "catasto" records, are largely useless since the various principals of the bank were not above flagrantly lying to the taxman. The once voluminous internal documentation has been grievously reduced by the passage of time:
This study is based mainly on the business records of the Medici Bank: partnership agreements, correspondence, and account books. The extant material is unfortunately fragmentary; for example, no balance sheets have survived. Only a few pages of some of the account books have escaped destruction by a frenzied mob.
Nevertheless, the sources are sufficiently numerous (exceeded only by the Datini's bank's archives, in Tuscany/Prato) that the Medici bank is well understood, especially as the remains of the Medici records were given to the city of Florence by a descendant of the Medici.
Organization and type.
Banks in Renaissance Florence were generally divided into three or four kinds:
Bank branches.
Because of communication delays, the Medici Bank was forced to establish two groups of relatively independent subsidiary units in important cities which communicated with the head bank via mail. Pisa, Milan, Venice in 1402, Geneva (moved to Lyons in 1466), Avignon, Bruges, London and an itinerant branch that followed the Pope around to tend to his needs—not for nothing have they been called "God's Bankers"—all hosted a Medici branch. If the bank could not establish a branch somewhere, then they would usually contract with some Italian banker (preferably one of the Florentine banks) to honor drafts and accept bills of exchange:
Of course, if an Italian agent could not be procured, any trustworthy banker would do; in Cologne, their representative was the German Abel Kalthoff.
A crucial distinction between the Medici Bank and its older rivals (the Peruzzi, the Bardi, the Acciaioli, etc.) was that its "decentralization" was not merely geographic: it was legal and financial. The Peruzzi bank was taken over by outsiders in 1331 because there was but one partnership, based in Florence and held largely by Peruzzi family members, which owned everything. The employees were only paid a salary for their service. So the nine original outsiders could slowly leverage their 21 shares to overwhelm the Peruzzi's collective 36 shares. The lack of clear leadership, though, when the leading partner died has been suggested as another factor in the failure of the Bardi and Peruzzi banks.
Branch legal structure.
Such a takeover was impossible in the Medici Bank. The essential structure was that of a single partnership based in Florence, which immutably held the lion's share of shares in each branch (and the three textile factories in Florence), which were themselves incorporated as independent partnerships. At the end of the year on March 24 (by the then used calendar), each partnership would be dissolved, although the Medici could dissolve a partnership at any time with six months' notice. The books were thoroughly gone through and checked, and a reckoning of profits would be made. Indeed, the structure of the Medici Bank resembles nothing so much as the modern holding company.
The branch manager (the "governatore", or "governor", would have put up a portion of his own money at the start of the partnership) and the investing partners could take out their profits at this point, since salaries or dividends were not paid when the partnership agreement was in effect, but usually the Florentine partners ("maggiori", "seniors") and the branch manager would then incorporate a fresh partnership if the manager's performance had been satisfactory. Managers were not paid salaries, but were considered to have invested in the partnership a sum greater than they actually had (for example, in 1455, the Venice branch's partnership agreement was renewed and the manager Alessandro Martelli invested 2,000 of the 14,000 ducats. He would be paid of the total profits not his fair th, but rather th).
The manager could, if he wished, attempt to start a rival bank, but he could not legally claim to be part of the Medici Bank, since a right to use that trademarked name came with the partnership. This measure would turn out to be effective against ambitious dissident juniors like Tommaso Portinari. However, even before the shares' profits were paid out, any sums invested in the branch outside of an ownership of shares were repaid at a set interest rate, sometimes leading to one branch paying another for the latter's investment in the former.
Governors were given wide latitude in daily operations and in the management of their seven or eight assistant managers, clerks, cashiers, accountants, or couriers who lived and boarded at the Medici-rented employee housing (although the managers had little say in their selection, which was done by the Florence bank), but policy was set by the seniors, and often firmly. The Bruges branch was, when first incorporated, strictly forbidden by the terms of the partnership to lend money to temporal lords and kings. Policy would generally be communicated to the branch managers during their biennial or triennial trips to Florence to report in person and discuss important issues, or in the private letters and reports their couriers carried.
Bills of exchange.
Usury was still banned by the Church in this period, with an interpretation concisely expressed as "Quidquid sorti accedit, usura est" ("Whatever exceeds the principal is usury"). So the Medici Bank could not openly adopt the modern formula of promising to pay interest on demand deposits and loaning out a fraction of the deposits at greater interest to pay for the interest on the deposit, since a depositor would gain revenue on the principal without any risk to the principal, which would have made both parties usurers and sinners; nor could they charge fees or other such devices.
Discretionary deposits were a partial way out, but the bank made most of its money by selling holographic "bills of exchange". These bills certified that a particular person or company had paid a particular Medici branch a certain sum of money, as verified by the general or assistant manager of that branch (who were the only ones allowed to make out such bills). The bill instructed the recipient Medici branch to pay back that sum in local currency, but not at whatever the local exchange rate for the two currencies concerned happened to be at the moment the bill was presented to be cashed in, but rather at the exchange rate set when the presenting (or current owner; bills of exchange could be sold and traded freely) person bought the bill of exchange. That there was a difference in time was guaranteed by the terms of the bill. A specific date could be set, but generally the time between a bill was issued in one city and could be cashed in at another was set by long-standing custom, or at "usance". The usance between Florence and London was 3 months, for example.
A fictional but illustrative example: a merchant is traveling from Florence to London. He buys a bill of exchange for 10 florins, with the understanding that the London branch will cash that bill at half a pound to the florin, for a total of 5 pounds. If he reaches London and discovers that the florin has become stronger against the pound, to the point where a florin buys a whole pound, he takes a loss: instead of the 10 pounds he could have gotten had he not bought the bill of exchange, he will instead receive only 5. Similarly, if the florin weakens greatly, he could well reap a windfall at the expense of the London branch.
Clearly the branches would want to try to maximize sales of bills of exchange in the former situation, where the rate of the issuing currency increases between the time of issuance and payment. This they attempted to do with frequent letters between branches and paying close attention to exchange rates. While close to loans, the element of risk meant that this practice did not actually become usury, except in the case of "dry exchange", where the moving around of money was fictitious. With appropriate issuances of bills, branches could move around money and actually make money. Similarly, they could be fairly certain of a profit when a bill was issued in one of the Italian branches because they could demand a premium of sorts for being asked to deliver money in a far away place at however far in the future usance set the maturation date. De Roover offers this real example:
Factories.
A controlling interest in a "bottega di seta" (silk shop) and two "botteghe di lana" (cloth manufacturing establishment) were further possessions of the Medici (although run in partnership with men of the necessary technical expertise). They paid by the piece and ran on the putting-out system; for the wool especially it was a very complex system, in which the early steps had to be done in the factories but then the spinning of the wool was done by women outside the factory, and the yarn collected to be brought to the weavers, who would then turn it over to the dyers and finishers in the factory. Legally, they were incorporated much the same as the branches, although unlike the branches, the managers apparently had complete latitude in managing employees.
The silk shop produced some of the finest silk wares, and were usually sold to Florentine exporters or shipped to the branch in Bruges as a consignment to feed the Burgundian court's strong appetite for such goods, or to the branch in Milan to sell to the Sforza court. The cloth manufacturers similarly produced very high-quality pieces and sold a good deal of their output to Milan and the Sforzas.
While lucrative, the revenues realized from the three factories should not be overemphasized: while the Medici often had invested more than 7,900 gold florins in the three "factories" in 1458, for example, the sum invested in "banks" in 1458 was more than 28,800—and that figure is low, for it excludes the Rome branch serving the Pope, the Medici's interest-bearing deposits in their branches, and also omits any accounting of several years' profit which were inaccessible (since the relevant partnerships had not yet been dissolved; this may seem to be a flaw in the system, but it built up capital in a branch and allowed it to lend out more than it had been incorporated with). Part of the reason for maintaining these factories when the funds could have been more profitably invested in the banks or trade could have been social: it seems to have a bit of a Florentine tradition to run such factories to provide employment for the poor—a social obligation, as it were.
The first beginnings of the factories came in 1402. Giovanni di Bicci began a partnership to run a wool factory with an experienced manager, Michele di Baldo di ser Michele. This first wool shop was followed by a second one in 1408, this time with Taddeo di Filippo. The first one was ended in 1420; de Roover speculates that it was poorly run and so not very profitable. Eventually another one was opened in 1439; the original eventually came to an end between 1458 and 1469 for unknown reasons ("probably because of the manager's death."). The last shop was apparently being liquidated in 1480 amidst a general decline in the Florentine textile industry, and does not appear again in the tax records. The silk shop is known to have not existed before 1430; the "libro segreto" ("secret records", the second set of books kept to record partners' profits, and generally more accurate than the public books, inasmuch as they state the real profits and losses and which depositors were real) mention that they entered into a short partnership with two silk manufacturers. When the partnership ended, one of the two manufacturers became the manager of the silk factory until his death in 1446 or 1447. The silk shop endured until 1480, when the last descendant of that partner died.
Alum cartel.
Alum was a vital commodity because of its many uses and relatively few sources. It was used in the wool preparing process to clean the wool of grease and other substances, as a mordant which fixed the dyes in the wool, in glassmaking, in tanning, and in a few other areas.
The Roman branch of the bank was not merely charged with the normal deposit and bill of exchange business of the bank, nor with just the mechanics of being "fiscal agents of the Holy See" (which entailed handling and moving the papal revenues, paying out designated subsidies to countries fighting the Turks, fees, etc., but the Medici did not actually collect the monies from sales of indulgences or taxes due the Papacy), but also with managing a certain piece of Papal property: the Tolfa alum mines, an interest they had acquired in 1473 in exchange for forgiving some of the Pope's long overdue debts to the Medici, although they had a previous interest in the "Societas Aluminum" (the company which farmed the mines after their discovery in 1460 in Tolfa near Civitavecchia; the agreement forming this company had three partners, one of whom was the mines' discover Giovanni da Castro, and was ratified by the pope on September 3, 1462) dating back to 1466, expecting that by breaking the Turkish monopoly of alum imported from the Middle East (from the mines in Asia Minor, at Phocaea near Smyrna) they could reap far more than their investments in the form of never to be repaid loans. The Medicis immediately set about trying to eliminate the competition, of which there were three main sources of large amounts of decent quality alum—Turkey, the mines in Ischia, and the mines in Volterra.
The Pope's share of the revenue was to be used to finance campaigns against the Hussites as well as the Turks, so buying Turkish alum was declared by him to be utterly immoral in that it helped the infidel enemy and hurt the faithful. Turkish alum was to be seized where it was found.
They discouraged the alum mining near Volterra in Italy, apparently pushing its inhabitants to revolt against Florentine rule. At Lorenzo's direction, the insurrection was brutally suppressed. The mines reduced output safely under Florentine (and thus, Medici) control. The sad outcome of this episode was that the sack was entirely unnecessary: exploitation of this mine was abandoned in 1483 simply because the mine was so poor that it was unprofitable.
Ischia was under the ownership and protection of the King of Naples, so the Medici and the company then exploited the Ischia mines signing a 25-year cartel agreement to restrict output and boost prices by only selling at a fixed price. This cartel flagrantly violated the teachings of the church, which tried to justify it by pointing to the virtuous military campaigns it would finance. Regardless, the cartel was not particularly successful. Turkish alum was never satisfactorily suppressed (the Pazzi bank is known to have smuggled Turkish alum into the Low Countries, for example), and the cartel was not well organized with conflict between the Medici branches. The Bruges branch and its manager Tommaso Portinari were convinced that the papal mines were simply producing far too much alum and glutting the market. They would not accept more alum on consignment until the alum they then had had finally sold.
Between this internal dissension, the dissension between cartel partners, the constant flow of Turkish alum, and the organized opposition of consumer groups, the alum interest was never as profitable as expected. Regardless of its success, or lack thereof, the alum interest ended after the Pazzi Conspiracy, in 1478, after which Pope Sixtus IV confiscated as much Medici property as he was able to.
Roman branch.
The Rome branch of the Medici bank was a fully incorporated partnership which technically did not reside in Rome. It was known internally as "ours who follow the Court of Rome" ("i nostri che seguono la Corte di Roma"), and only contingently resided in Rome at times, as it followed the Papal court. Odd situations could occur, though. When Pope Martin V resided in the Dominican friary of Santa Maria Novella from February 1419 to September 1420, and when Pope Eugene IV stayed there, the Rome branch set up operations in Florence itself, even though the Florence branch was still in operation.
The Rome branch was always busy. The Papal court was attended by hundreds of minor officials, both ecclesiastical and secular, along with their attendants. The needs of the Papal court were such that there was a measurable rise in the frequency of money shortages wherever the court went. This led to a need for banking services that the Medici could provide. The various bishops, cardinals, and prelates often held Church or private estates in far-flung states in and beyond Italy. The revenues from these estates needed to be transferred to wherever the Court was residing. A more practical reason was that alternate investments generally took the form of real estate, and any cardinal or bishop who invested overly much in real estate (which they were not supposed to) or relied on income from Church lands might see his investments confiscated under a new Pope who might not favor him so much or even turned over to a replacement. Accounts with the Medici were kept secret and generally free from prying, ecclesiastical eyes, especially in the case of discretionary deposits.
Persons not already at the court made use of the branch for cashing letters of credit to make their pilgrimage or journey safer. Tribute from the many dioceses and institutions the Church controlled needed to be consolidated (but not collected by the Medici) and then safely transmitted. That service, too, the Medici could provide to a degree, though not in all areas. To carry out their services, the papal bankers were often given considerable power: if a banker could not collect the rents due the pope, they had but to complain and the offending cleric would be summarily excommunicated (a threat aired in 1441 against the slow Bishop of Nevers), or they could block appointments, as they threatened to do to John Kemp, whose nephew had just been appointed to the bishopric of London with their aid, if the proper payments were not soon made.
Officially, the branch could not make its money by lending at a profit to the Popes (who were lax in repaying the Medici), and taking in many deposits at interest. The branch did this to some extent, but the principal means of profit came from commercial transactions. Rather than charging interest, "the Medici overcharged the pope on the silks and brocades, the jewels and other commodities they supplied.".
These payments were entirely one way, and not exchanges. Rome and Italy generally produced little to nothing of value and so the balance of trade was greatly unequal. It could be alleviated by the production from northern silver mines, but in general the main commodity Italy was willing to exchange specie for was English wool. The decline in availability of English wool to be imported, and the general concomitant economic problems, have been identified as one of the contributing causes to the bank's decline.
At this time, the Popes frequently held great councils and conferences. These meetings of eminent and wealthy individuals gave rise to a need for advanced banking services, to such a degree that the Medici were not the only Italian bank to open up temporary branches wherever such councils were convened.
The close relation between the papacy and the branch declined over the years, with the decline especially pronounced after 1464, with few to no branch managers being selected to be the "depositary-general", the official who was essentially the fiscal agent for the Apostolic Chamber, or the Church's treasury. Pope Sixtus IV would repudiate the Medici's control of the alum trade and also his debts to them, as well as seizing Medici property in Rome following the Pazzi Conspiracy in 1478. The Pazzi's interlocked businesses and banks had captured the alum business after the Medici were removed from it, and were supplying the depositary-general from their ranks, indicating that they were trying to follow the Medici route of initially building up their empire through papal custom. The papacy would eventually agree to repay the debts, but did so extremely slowly; so slowly that the branch manager Giovanni Tornabuoni agreed to take stocks of alum instead, despite the depressed market for alum. Tornabuoni would still be in charge when 1494 came and the edifice of the Medici came crashing down. Because the branch had been doing so poorly, it owed more than it was due, so the Roman government was satisfied to allow Tornabuoni to assume the rest of the partnership's equity and debts.

Juan de Silva

Juan de Silva (died April 19, 1616 in Malacca) was a Spanish military commander and governor of the Philippines, from April 1609 until his death on April 19, 1616.
De Silva was a native of Trujillo, Spain, and a knight of the Order of Santiago. He arrived in the Philippines as governor and captain general at Easter, 1609, bring with him five companies of reinforcements for the Spanish military in the colony. He developed a reputation for bravery and determination in his fight with the Dutch in the Far East.
Defeat of the Dutch at Manila.
On December 22, 1607 a Dutch fleet of the Company of the East Indies set sail from Texel to attack the Portuguese fleet and forts in the East. The fleet consisted of 13 vessels, 225 artillery pieces and more than 2,800 men. It was under the command of Admiral Pierre Willemsz., with François de Wittert as vice-admiral. The fleet fought with the Portuguese in Mozambique, Sumatra and Johore before building a fort at Near, in the Banda Islands (present-day Indonesia). Here on May 22, 1609 the admiral and some of his officers were killed in an attack by the natives, and Wittert assumed command.
Thereafter Wittert sailed to Manila to attack the Spanish there. (Spain and Portugal were ruled by the same king, Philip III of Spain (Philip II of Portugal), and thus were allies.) Wittert besieged Manila for five months, beginning in 1609. However, on April 24 or April 25, 1610, while supervising the unloading of junks, Wittert was surprised by at least 12 Spanish ships. His flagship, the "Amsterdam", was captured after a lengthy fight, and the admiral was killed. Two ships apparently escaped, but the Spanish killed at least 85 Dutch and took 120 or more prisoners.
Also during the first part of Governor de Silva's term, the fourth archbishop of Manila, Diego Vazquez de Mercado, arrived there (June 4, 1610).
Expeditions to the Moluccas.
De Silva sent an unsuccessful expedition against the Dutch in the Moluccas in 1611, although the expedition did take Sabougo on Gilolo and establish a fort there. De Silva intended to secure Portuguese help to expel the Dutch from the area once and for all. To this end in 1612 he dispatched the former governor of Ternate, Cristobal de Azcueta to Portuguese India to make plans with the viceroy there for a joint assault. However Azcueta and the entire expedition were lost in a shipwreck between Manila and Macao.
De Silva tried again, this time sending two Jesuit emissaries to Goa. They arrived in 1615 and reached an agreement with the Portuguese viceroy that he would contribute four large galleons, to be sent to Malacca. This information was received in Manila, where a large Spanish fleet was already prepared, in July 1615. In order to obtain the artillery for this expedition de Silva had weakened the defenses of Manila, with grave risks in the event of an attack on the city by the Dutch.
There was no news of the arrival of the Portuguese galleons, but against the advice of many of his subordinates, Governor de Silva sailed for Malacca on February 9, 1616. He commanded ten galleons, four galleys and various smaller vessels. The flagship was the 1,700-ton "San Marcos". The fleet carried 5,000 men, both soldiers and sailors, including nearly 2,000 Spaniards and a unit of Japanese infantry, which numbered at 500. It also carried 300 artillery pieces and 6 Jesuits. It was the largest European armada yet seen in the region.
The fleet sailed for the Strait of Malacca, with the intention of uniting with the expected Portuguese armada and then attacking the Dutch factory on Java and thereafter the Dutch bases on the islands of the Moluccas. But the Portuguese fleet had already been attacked by the Dutch near Malacca and completely destroyed. In order to avoid their capture, the Portuguese had burned their big galleons.
The Spanish fleet entered the Strait of Singapore on February 25, 1616. From there Governor de Silva sent Juan Gutierrez Paramo with part of the fleet to reinforce Ternate (in the Moluccas).
But the governor was in poor health. He had earlier asked several times to be relieved of office for health reasons. Now his health deteriorated further, and on April 19, 1616, he died in Malacca. The whole Spanish enterprise had to be abandoned, with nothing accomplished against the Dutch.
The armada returned to Manila on June 1, 1616, "sin gente" (without people). Although they had not faced combat, many men had died of fevers and other illnesses that struck the fleet in Malacca and the Strait of Singapore.
Critics of the governor, both among his contemporaries and later historians, have claimed that had he sailed directly to the Moluccas rather than to Malacca, he very possibly could have dislodged the undermanned Dutch from the archipelago.
After his death.
The "Audiencia" of Manila took charge of political affairs in the absence of Juan de Silva. Jerónimo de Silva, an uncle of the governor, was made interim governor by a royal decree in March 1616. The "Audiencia" governed until June or July, 1618, when the new governor, Alonso Fajardo y Tenza arrived and took up office.

SIC Mulher

SIC Mulher (lit. "SIC Woman") is a Portuguese basic cable and satellite television channel owned by Sociedade Independente de Comunicação (SIC) and launched on March 8, 2003. The target audience of this general entertainment channel are women.
History.
The channel started broadcasting on March 8, 2003, International Women's Day. In June 2006, it was equated that SIC Mulher would shut down in December of the same year, due to the low ratings reached by the channel,which was ultimately not achieved.
In March 2023 - and regarding the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of SIC Mulher -, it was announced that in January this year the channel has achieved its best result (in terms of audience and/or "rating") during the period of the preceding decade.
Beginning in October 2022, the channel started airing Turkish series with Latin American Spanish dubs - later followed by its sister channel SIC Caras -, becoming a successful product, displacing its airtime from international reality and talent shows. Portuguese content is seen overnight as of early 2025.

Cape grysbok

The Cape or southern grysbok (Raphicerus melanotis) is a small antelope that is endemic to the Western Cape region of South Africa between Albany and the Cederberg mountains.
Description.
It has a rough, reddish sandy coat flecked in white. The head, neck and legs are less flecked and somewhat yellowish, while the inside of the ears, eye-rings, mouth area, throat and underside are white. There is a black "bridge" to the nose and a dark scent gland in front of the eye. It stands only 21" (45–55 cm) at the shoulder and weighs slightly more than 20 pounds (8–12 kg). The short tail of the Cape grysbok measures 4 to 8 cm and is almost invisible. Males have short, sharp and straight horns about 8 cm long, which are smooth. The Cape grysbok can fluff out the fur at its rear end to make itself look bigger.
Habitat.
The Cape grysbok's native habitat is the "Fynbos biome" (Cape Floristic Region), and it inhabits thick shrubland. It can sometimes be found browsing orchards and vineyards. In the Cape Peninsula the grysbok can be found in urban edges close to human activity. It may also be found in reed beds and along the riverbed of the southern Karoo.
Habits.
The Cape grysbok is probably territorial as sightings are mostly of individual animals. It is a browser. It can apparently go without drinking water for long periods, gaining most of its requirements from its food. It is primarily nocturnal, though it may be seen during early morning and late evening during the southern winter. Like Sharpe's grysbok they use a communal latrine and mark plants in its vicinity with secretions from their pre-orbital glands. It defends itself by jumping forward toward its target then running away.
Breeding.
Lambs are born in the southern summer after a gestation period of about 6 months. They stay hidden and grow fast.
Similar species.
The similar Sharpe's grysbok ("Raphicerus sharpei") can be found in south-eastern Africa. The primary physical difference between the two grysboks is that Sharpe's has a pair of "false hooves" above the fetlocks.

<doc id="6948151" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6948151" title="Doris M. Johnson High School">
Doris M. Johnson High School

Doris M. Johnson High School was a public high school located in the northeast area known as Clifton Park of Baltimore, Maryland.
It was formerly known as "School #426 at the Lake Clifton Campus" that was operational in the 2003–04 school year as a result of the breakup of Lake Clifton Eastern High School, into two smaller high schools. In 2005—2006 the high school was formally named Doris M. Johnson High School. The comprehensive high school specializes in the law and leadership focus.
At the January 26, 2011 Baltimore City School Board meeting, school system CEO, Dr. Andrés Alonso announced that Doris M. Johnson would be among five schools to close at the conclusion of the 2010–2011 school year, pending board approval. The REACH! Partnership School that currently shares campus space with Doris M. Johnson will expand to utilize the newly vacant parts of the Lake Clifton campus.
History.
When the school first opened in it was named School #426 at the Lake Clifton Campus until the 2005 school year when the Baltimore City School Board passed a resolution renaming the school to Doris M. Johnson High School. Doris M. Johnson was a Baltimore community leader for the Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello community, she started the local Adopt-A-House program and was a BCPSS School Board member and a member of the board of elections. It was decided by students, staff and the community to rename the school to remind future generations of Ms. Johnson's contributions.
History Channel relationship.
"Save Our History".
In May 2006, the History Channel's "Save Our History" initiative mentioned in their newsletter Doris M. Johnson High School. In 2005, the newsletter stated a "Save Our History" grant was awarded to the school in partnership of the Maryland Historical Society that funds a project that introduces students to the history of Clifton Park. The Clifton Park community was once a center of Baltimore City for "business, entertainment, worship, and strong social familial, and community pride" but has recently become impoverished and in History Channel's words "its proud history was in danger of being lost."
Guidance for the project was given by Doris M. Johnson's principal Tricia Rock, a history teacher Michael Douglas, and Jennifer Yaremczak from the Maryland Historical Society. The students obtained oral histories from community members and thoroughly researched the history of the public park surrounding the Lake Clifton complex, the history of the African American cemetery in the community, movie theaters, baseball parks, and the histories of the origin of local street names. A book was produced by students titled "My Neighborhood: A Social and Cultural History of Northeast Baltimore" which is available with transcripts of the oral histories at Doris Johnson and the MHS.
Civil Rights Movement in Baltimore.
In 2006, another project was conducted by the school and the MHS, the project focused on the Civil Rights Movement in Baltimore, the integration of Gwynn Oak Park, the Northwood Shopping Center, the Route 40 campaign during the Freedom Rides, the Holy Week Riots of 1968 and Baltimore riot of 1968, and the Cambridge riot of 1963 and 1967. Students again, collected oral histories from community members regarding their experiences of the 1960s and the Civil Rights Movement. Students wrote essays that was compiled into a book and website [www.mdcivilrights.org] as well.
Unchained Talent.
The after-school performing arts program started in the 2004 school year by volunteer Christina Youngston, and the club was given the name Unchained Talent by students. Unchained Talent is unique in that the school system does not provide the drama program for the school; Unchained Talent is a non-profit and sustains itself through donations and charitable giving.
The first theatrical production Unchained Talent did occurred in December 2004 in front of an audience of 100 and it made front-page news in the Baltimore Sun newspaper. A local news affiliate did a segment and it drew attention from local Councilwoman Mary Pat Clarke, the Mayor's Office and United States Congressman Elijah Cummings.
Since 2004, Unchained Talent has put on two to three productions per school year, most of them student written. In 2005, Unchained Talent had a big milestone in that it was awarded an Open Society Institute-Baltimore Community Fellowship to stabilize the program for 18 months.
Unchained Talent expanded to include students from Heritage High School and the REACH school. Unfortunately new principals did not support the program and Unchained Talent moved out of the Lake Clifton Campus in 2012 to focus on expansion programs that had been established in several other schools and a citywide site.

Chris Haughey

Christopher Francis Haughey (October 3, 1925 – April 24, 2022), nicknamed "Bud", was an American pitcher who appeared in one game for the Brooklyn Dodgers of Major League Baseball during the 1943 season. At 18 years of age, the , rookie was the second-youngest player to appear in a National League game that season.
Haughey is one of many ballplayers who only appeared in the major leagues during World War II. His major league debut happened to be on his 18th birthday, and it was the last game of the season. He pitched seven innings of relief against the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field, giving up five hits, ten walks, and six runs (three earned) in a 6–1 loss. Johnny Vander Meer was the winning pitcher. His career ended with a 0–1 record and a 3.86 ERA. Five other players made their Major League debut on the same day, October 3, 1943, as Haughey: Norm Brown, Hank Camelli, Cookie Cuccurullo, Gil Hodges, and Tony Ordenana.
After losing two seasons to the war in 1944–45, Haughey returned to the Dodgers and played in the minor leagues to work on his fastball. He would be signed by the St. Louis Cardinals, and remained in the minors for five seasons through 1950, winning fifteen games for the St. Joseph Cardinals of the Class C Western Association in 1947. Afterwards, Haughey attended Fordham University, graduating with a degree in physics. He worked for a New York oil company, and then in retail, firstly for his brother-in-law's store in Salinas, California, of which he was a part-owner, and then for a Macy's store in Pleasanton, California. He later lived in Fremont, California, before moving back to Salinas, where he was in a rehabilitation center at the time of his death.
Haughey died on April 24, 2022, at the age of 96. He was the last living major league baseball player from the 1943 season.

Devaki Pandit

Devaki Pandit (; born 6 March 1965) is an Indian classical singer.
Early life.
Born in a household with performers in her family, Pandit was exposed to a plethora of art. Of her humble beginnings she says, "Beauty in music emerges from the total, complete self-surrender to the Swar. My journey with music is to attain that Beauty through Sadhana, practice. I understood this co-relation at very early age as I was surrounded by artists musicians, actors, authors who lived with this truth every moment. My maternal grandmother Mangala Ranade and her sisters hailed from Goa and were renowned musicians, singers."

Virginia State Route 4

State Route 4 (SR 4) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. Known as Buggs Island Road, the state highway runs from the North Carolina state line near Palmer Springs north to U.S. Route 58 (US 58) near Midway. SR 4 connects US 58 with John H. Kerr Dam, which impounds the Roanoke River to form Kerr Lake. The state highway was assigned concurrent with the construction of the dam and reservoir in the early 1950s.
The entire length of SR 4 is part of U.S. Bicycle Route 1.
Route description.
SR 4 begins at the North Carolina state line southwest of the community of Palmer Springs. The roadway continues south as NC 1200 (Drewry Virginia Line Road) toward Middleburg. The state highway heads north to the east of several arms of Kerr Lake. SR 4 veers northwest and follows the shore of the lake to John H. Kerr Dam, on top of which the state highway crosses the Roanoke River. The road on top of the dam, which separates Kerr Lake from Lake Gaston, is maintained by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The state highway passes through the hamlet of Castle Heights and crosses Kettles Creek and Allen Creek before reaching its northern terminus at US 58 near Midway between South Hill and Boydton. The roadway continues north as SR 674 (Wooden Bridge Road).
History.
SR 4 was added to the primary state highway system in 1952; the dam was completed that same year.

Diffuse esophageal spasm

Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES), also known as distal esophageal spasm, is a condition characterized by uncoordinated contractions of the esophagus, which may cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or regurgitation. In some cases, it may cause symptoms such as chest pain, similar to heart disease. In many cases, the cause of DES remains unknown.
Certain abnormalities on x-ray imaging are commonly observed in DES, such as a "corkscrew esophagus" or "rosary bead esophagus", although these findings are not unique to this condition. Specialized testing called manometry can be performed to evaluate the motor function of the esophagus, which can help identify abnormal patterns of muscle contraction within the esophagus that are suggestive of DES. The treatment of DES consists primarily of medications, such as acid suppressing agents (like proton-pump inhibitors), calcium channel blockers, hyoscine butylbromide, or nitrates. In only extremely rare cases, surgery may be considered. People with DES have higher incidences of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), neuromuscular diseases, and degenerative neurological disorders.
Signs and symptoms.
DES manifests as intermittent difficulty swallowing solid foods and liquids (dysphagia), and atypical chest pain. The chest pain may appear similar to cardiac chest pain (angina pectoris), so investigating the possible existence of heart disease is often indicated.
Causes.
The causes of diffuse esophageal spasm is unclear. It is thought, however, that many cases are caused by uncontrolled brain signals running to nerve endings. Therefore, suppression medication is often the first-line therapy such as antidepressants and anti-epileptic medication are prescribed. It has also been reported that very cold or hot beverages can trigger an esophageal spasm. Avoidance therapy benefits some people, but it has not been medically proven. Food allergies or intolerances may also be a cause in which spasms may be triggered within hours or days from the offending foods.
Diagnosis.
Several radiographic findings are suggestive of DES, such as a "corkscrew esophagus" or "rosary bead esophagus" appearance on barium swallow x-ray, although these findings are not unique to DES.
Treatment.
Several drugs are used to treat DES, including nitroglycerin, hyoscine butylbromide, calcium channel blockers, hydralazine, and anti-anxiety medications. Acid suppression therapy, such as proton-pump inhibitors, are often the first-line therapy.
Procedures.
Botulinum toxin, which inhibits acetylcholine release from nerve endings, injected above the lower esophageal sphincter may also be used in the treatment of DES. Small studies have suggested benefit from endoscopic balloon dilation in certain patients, but all of the above have a low percentage of success in treating the condition; whilst the treatments work in some sufferers, it does not work for everyone. In extremely rare cases, surgery may be considered.
Epidemiology.
It affects about 1 per 100,000 people per year.

Umpqua Holdings Corporation

Umpqua Holdings Corporation, d.b.a. Umpqua Bank, was a financial holding company based in downtown Portland, Oregon, United States. Headquarters were in the Umpqua Bank Plaza, formerly the headquarters of Benj. Franklin Savings and Loan. The firm had two principal operating subsidiaries: Umpqua Bank (the Bank) and Umpqua Investments (formerly Strand, Atkinson, Williams and York (Investments)).
The company’s main operating segments were personal banking and lending, business banking and lending, and wealth management. The bank serves consumers and businesses in the community.
As of 2015, Umpqua Bank had $24 billion in assets and $18 billion in deposits and was ranked among the largest 60 banks in the nation. Its parent company, Umpqua Holdings, was publicly traded. As of 2016, Umpqua Bank was the largest Oregon-based bank and had 350 branches in Oregon, Washington, California, Nevada and Idaho.
In October 2021, Umpqua announced it was merging with Tacoma-based Columbia Bank. Columbia Bank branches would transition to the Umpqua name and branding. The combined holdings company would be based in Tacoma, with the bank operational headquarters based in the Portland area. 
History.
South Umpqua State Bank was formed in 1953, in Canyonville, Oregon, with six employees. It was started by a group of people working in the timber business who wanted to create a means for the employees to cash their payroll checks. The bank opened with capital of $50,000 and surplus and reserves of $25,000. The bank’s first savings account was opened by Pete Duchene, a local business agent. D.B. “Tex” Ritter and his wife Nadine opened the first commercial account for their South Umpqua Trucking Company.
In 2002, Umpqua increased its number of branches to 63 by acquiring Centennial Bancorp of Eugene, Oregon, for $214 million. On January 16, 2009, Umpqua agreed to assume the deposits of Vancouver, Washington-based Bank of Clark County after the latter bank was seized by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Umpqua agreed to assume the deposits of Seattle, Washington-based Evergreen Bank in January 2010 after the latter was closed by the Washington Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed receiver. A month later the company agreed to take over the deposits of Tacoma, Washington-based Rainier Pacific Bank after it was seized by the FDIC. The next month, Umpqua acquired the banking operations of Rainier Pacific Bank in a purchase agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Umpqua continued with acquisitions in 2012 when they attempted to buy California-based American Perspective Bank for $44.7 million, which would have added two branches to Umpqua's then 196 branches. The deal fell through, however, when Umpqua was outbid; American Perspective paid Umpqua a $1.6 million fee to terminate the deal. Umpqua had been expanding into the San Francisco Bay Area and closed a $24.9 million deal to buy Bay Area-based Circle Bancorp in November 2012.
In September 2013, Umpqua announced it would buy Sterling Financial Corporation, parent of Sterling Bank, the second largest bank in Washington. The $2 billion deal closed in April 2014 and increased the number of bank branches to 394 and increased assets to $22 billion.
Former CEO and President of Umpqua Holdings Corporation Raymond Davis took over the local 40-person South Umpqua Bank in 1994. Davis became CEO and President of Umpqua Holdings in 1999. In 2007, Davis authored a book titled "Leading for Growth: How Umpqua Bank Got Cool and Created a Culture of Greatness".
Cort O’Haver became President in April 2016, with Davis retaining the role of CEO. Davis stepped down as CEO in January 2017. O’Haver took over as CEO at that point while Davis became executive chair of the bank's board and continued to oversee Pivotus Ventures Inc. until his formal retirement, which was announced In late December 2017 and effective January 2, 2018.
In late February 2023, Columbia Banking System and Umpqua Holdings officially closed their merger combining banking operations, with more than $52 billion in assets. The bank now operates as Umpqua Bank. The holding company, Columbia Banking System, Inc., trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol 'COLB.'

Amalickiah

In the Book of Mormon, Amalickiah () was a Nephite dissenter. His first appearance in the text is as a political dissident with aspirations to re-establish a monarchy. Later, after seizing the Lamanite throne, Amalickiah led a war to enslave the Nephites. After his death he was succeeded by his brother Ammoron. The story appears in the latter half of the Book of Alma.
Amalickiah has been appraised by some theologians as a narrative mirror to Ammon and as an inversion of other heroes within the Book of Mormon, notably Captain Moroni.
Narrative in the Book of Mormon.
Initial dissension from the Nephites.
Following Helaman's ascension to the station of high priest, Amalickiah leads a group of Nephite elites (referred to as Amalickiahites) in a bid to install himself as king over the Nephites. This angers Moroni, the commander of the Nephite armies, who in response lays out the values of the Nephite establishment in the Title of Liberty. After Moroni raises an army to halt the attempted coup, Amalickiah escapes to the land of Nephi, located in Lamanite territory, with a significantly reduced group of supporters.
Usurping the Lamanite throne.
Upon their arrival in the land of Nephi, the Amalickiahites agitate the Lamanites to war against the Nephites. The king of the Lamanites sides with the Nephite dissidents, against the objections of the bulk of his subjects. The Lamanites who do not wish to invade Nephite territory flee to Onidah, where they appoint a new king and leader named Lehonti.
Amalickiah stations his followers in a valley at the base of a mountain where Lehonti and his partisans are encamped. Lehonti spurns three of Amalickiah's attempts at diplomacy, finally acquiescing the fourth time when told to bring his guards and meet Amalickiah, who had ascended almost the entire mountain alone. As they meet, Amalickiah proposes that the two armies combine, with Lehonti in charge and Amalickiah as his second. Amalickiah then arranges to quietly poison Lehonti, seizing control of the unified army. After solidifying his command of the Lamanite military, he marches to the king, who remained in the land of Nephi.
The Lamanite king leaves the city to greet the victorious army, and is promptly killed by Amalickiah's advance party. Before the king's guards can react, Amalickiah's men announce that the king has been murdered by his own guards, who flee under hot pursuit by the Lamanite army. Amalickiah then seduces the Lamanite queen under the pretense of being a war hero and ally of her deceased husband and crowns himself king over the Lamanites.
Invasion of Nephite lands.
After an extensive propaganda campaign, Amalickiah orders an invasion with the stated goal of subjugating the Nephites. The expeditionary force is repulsed by Moroni's innovations in fortifications and defensive tactics. Frustrated, Amalickiah makes an oath to drink Moroni's blood in retaliation and assumes personal command of his army. Under his direction, Lamanite troops occupy seven coastal Nephite cities. Teancum, a Nephite commander, intercepts Amalickiah's army as it attempts a deeper penetration of Nephite territory. After a day long battle, "the two armies [rest] by the sea". Teancum and an unnamed aide then infiltrate the Lamanite camp and Teancum kills Amalickiah in his sleep. This leads to a Lamanite withdrawal and retrenchment, pausing the invasion.
Textual history.
In the original manuscript of the Book of Mormon, the first two iteration of "Amalickiah" are spelled as such, but throughout the remainder of the text Oliver Cowdery, scribing for Joseph Smith's dictation of the Book of Mormon, frequently misspelled the name by replacing the second or third vowels (or both) with the letter "e", as in "Ameleckiah". This suggests Smith pronounced the name by placing emphasis on the first syllable (rather than the second, as contemporary readers tend).
Latter-day Saint scholarship.
Death at New Year.
At least three Latter-day Saint apologists have argued that the timing of Amalickiah's assassination was religiously significant. This idea begins with apologist John L. Sorenson's essay on "Seasonality of Warfare in the Book of Mormon and in Mesoamerica," where he concludes that the first and last months of the Nephite calendar were the primary season for battles and wars in the Book of Mormon. A. Brent Merrill further develops the concept by quoting Sorenson's work on the ritual significance of the New Year while asserting that Teancum's actions were more significant than previously thought in a paper entitled "Nephite Captains and Armies." In a 1991 address to the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, Allen J. Christenson continues this thread of argument by pointing out that the Book of Alma describes the Lamanites' "terror" at the death of their king at the beginning of the New Year. He claims that this was evidence that, like the Maya, "the Lamanites... recognized the importance of the New Year in the renewal of kingship." Christenson, a specialist on Mayan culture, compares this further to Maya preferences to commence combat operations in either the beginning of the New Year or the end of the old one.
Leadership studies.
Several Latter-day Saint scholars have examined Amalickiah as a model of leadership. In a master's thesis, Christopher J. Peterson refers to Amalickiah as a "pseudo-transformational leader" and a case study of "the 'Hitler Problem.'" David L. Rockwood and J. Gordon Daines III, in an article for the academic journal "Religious Educator", use Amalickiah and Captain Moroni to develop this theme. Rockwood and Daines conclude that both were presented as highly effective leaders, although they express concern about Amalickiah's predisposition for violence and selfishness. Political scientist Ryan W. Davis, in the "Journal of Book of Mormon Studies", concludes that Amalickiah's reign demonstrates that "short conflicts... favor the Lamanite autocracy, but extended conflicts are ultimately won by the Nephite democracy," which fits with the expectations of democratic peace theory. Davis further notes that Amalickiah's apparent disregard for the safety of the Lamanite citizenry matches with the Book of Mormon's negative portrayal of wars of ambition.
Literary role.
According to Latter-day Saint theologian and philosopher Joseph M. Spencer, the structure of the Book of Alma sets Amalickiah up as a narrative mirror to Ammon. These "broad parallels" include that Amalickiah and Ammoron "wished that they were heirs to the throne," whereas Ammon and Aaron "are Nephite heirs to the throne who walk away from power." Spencer also finds evidence for this in that both stories have their turning point in "encounters with a dead (or apparently dead) king," and points out several similar details throughout the Book of Alma.
Amalickiah is also heavily analyzed in "The Book of Mormon For the Least of These", a Book of Mormon commentary by Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Olsen Hemmings. Salleh and Olsen Hemmings suggest that an early reference to "Amalickiah's physique" sets him apart as narratively opposed to similarly described heroes (e.g. Nephi, son of Lehi). They further comment on how "his oath to drink the blood of Moroni offers an inversion of covenant-making"; Amalickiah's oath is predicated on violence and is a perversion of the gospel of Jesus Christ as presented in the Book of Mormon. Further, Salleh and Olsen Hemmings consistently find that Amalickiah acts contrary to the interests of his people for personal gain.
Proposed etymology.
The "-iah" suffix can be found in a number of Book of Mormon names such as Mosiah and Sariah, as well as the Biblical names Isaiah, Jeremiah and Zedekiah, where it represents Yah or Jah (, "Yah"), a shortening of the name Yahweh (Jehovah). This short form of the Name of God occurs 50 times in the text of the Hebrew Bible, of which 24 form part of the phrase "Hallelujah", which is actually a two-word phrase, not one word. The preceding syllables resemble the name "Amaleki", which according to Hugh Nibley, a prominent Latter-day Saint intellectual and apologist, simply means "my king" in Hebrew. Thus Amalickiah has been proposed to mean "My King is Jah" if it is a Hebrew name.

Compliance training

Compliance training refers to the process of educating employees on laws, regulations and company policies that apply to their day-to-day job responsibilities. An organization that engages in compliance training typically hopes to accomplish several goals:
Purpose.
Organizations offer their employees compliance training on a wide range of topics, including workplace discrimination and harassment, dealings with competitors, insider trading, protecting trade secrets, records management, bribery and kickbacks, etc. Typically, most or all of these compliance topics are addressed in an organization's Code of Conduct, and the organization may offer employees annual or bi-annual Code of Conduct training in lieu of requiring employees to take multiple individual training programs.
Compliance training is essential in ensuring that all employees of an organization are aware of how to properly perform their job so that the company and the employees are not in a position of liability. With a wide range of internal company policies and procedures among many different industries, standards must be set on all levels of the organization.
Corporate Compliance vs. Regulatory Compliance.
Corporate compliance covers both industry policies and procedures as well as federal, state and local compliance laws. Regulatory compliance is when a company abides by those laws and regulations. If a company is found to be out of compliance with certain laws pertaining to their industry, this can result in fines and/or legal punishment.
History.
Compliance training in the U.S. which refer to how employees are to act and be treated in the workplace can also be traced back to the creation of the United States Labor Laws as early as 1908 and the Federal Employers Liability Act.
In 1977 the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act addressed accounting transparency requirements, and bribery of foreign officials.
The 1985 Blue Ribbon Presidential Commission was in response to possible scandals during the Reagan presidency.
"The history of how compliance regulations and mandates came about is not linear and completely clear, however most refer that it began around the Reagan scandals during his presidency. Moving ahead from that, it was the early 1990s after the Federal Sentencing Guidelines promised reduced fines for implementing an Effective Compliance and Ethics Program (ECEP). The last phase came from a number of high profile corporate corruption cases that include companies such as Enron, MCI/WorldCom, and Tyco."

Who is required to have compliance training?
In the modern marketplace, nearly every industry is held to certain regulatory standards for information and data handling. Certified regulatory compliance has proven to be a challenge for many businesses. Regulation complicates many aspects of recordkeeping and operations, especially in industries that handle sensitive data. As a result, the line between remaining compliant and properly protecting customer data and sensitive assets has a tendency to blur.
Companies in all business sectors are under pressure to demonstrate that their employees are trained in laws and regulations, and internal policies, that pertain to their roles. Most notably, companies in the financial, healthcare and education sectors - who face stringent regulations - and publicly regulated companies have taken the lead by instituting firm-wide compliance training programs. For example, WalMart would be required to train their employees on sexual harassment, data security, anti-harassment, and more.
For financial institutions, the key compliance training topics are anti money laundering, sanctions, and insider dealing (market abuse in the EU).
Hospitals and clinics are required to have strict compliance training on a range of different topics relating to the health and safety of all visitors, patients and staff members. Since the healthcare industry has a tendency to be litigious in today's day and age, it is even more important for all doctors and medical staff to be aware of their local, state and federal laws as it pertains to their job.
Process.
Compliance training can be performed in-house by compliance training specialists, or hired out to consultant firms. Some compliance training is done online.
Penalties for non-compliance.
While this is entirely tied to the realm of compliance that is being considered, the penalties can range from a Fine, through the seizure of company assets, to jail time for executives of the company at fault. For example, the consequences of not being compliant with Anti Money Laundering cost the Las Vegas Sands Resort to pay $47 Million in penalties for suspicious credit card transactions.
HIPAA fines for lack of compliance can be staggering as well. In the past, the Alaska State Department paid $1,700,000 in fines for an Unencrypted USB hard drive stolen, poor policies and risk analysis.

Bolshiye Koty

Bolshiye Koty () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Irkutsk Oblast, Russia situated on the western shore of Lake Baikal, to the northeast of Listvyanka. The history of the settlement is closely tied to the beginning of gold mining near Baikal in 1842.
There are several versions of the origin of the name Bolshiye Koty. According to the dictionary by Vladimir Dal, "koty" means a trap for fish installed at the mouth of a river. Alternatively, the name of the settlement comes from the word "Kotky", or "Koty", a word used to call wooden shoes worn by "katorzhnik" - a forced laborer in katorga camps.
The settlement belongs to Pribaikalsky National Park. The Bolshiye Koty River runs near the settlement and into Lake Baikal. The settlement is accessible during the summer by ferry from Irkutsk or Listvyanka and in the winter via roads across the ice on the lake. It is also the home of Biostation #1, the first of ten research centers around the lake. This Biostation operates in coordination with Irkutsk State University, and in the summer hosts study programs for biology and meteorology students from the university.

The Baumoff Explosive

"The Baumoff Explosive", also known as "Eloi, Eloi, Lama Sabachthani" is a horror story by William Hope Hodgson, first published in 1919.
Plot.
The story is told using a framework or "story within a story", a method used by Hodgson in many of his stories. It is learned in the framework story that a strange new explosive has been developed. Invented by a man named Baumoff, this substance has the effect of creating a temporary area of darkness, into which light does not readily pass.
The main body of the story describes the narrator's meeting with Baumoff, who is described as a scientist who is also profoundly Christian and obsessed with the crucifixion. Baumoff believes that events following Christ's death (the darkening of the sky, the rending of the temple curtain, and shaking of the ground, as described in the gospels) have a rational, scientific basis. This basis is the ability of the human psyche to affect the aether and impede the transmission of light. Baumoff displays a tiny quantity of a chemical compound which, when crushed and burned, creates a region of temporary darkness.
Baumoff then goes on to demonstrate what happens when the substance is "burned" (metabolized) within his own body. While the narrator watches in horror, Baumoff's heart rate and respiration increase dangerously, and he begins driving metal spikes into his hands and feet to simulate the pain of Christ's crucifixion. The narrator begs him to stop his demonstration, but Baumoff insists that the narrator only observe and take careful note. The flickering darkness returns, and the house begins to shake. Baumoff begins to imagine that he is reliving Christ's final hours, which by putting himself in the place of Christ, verges on blasphemy; as he describes what he is imagining, the narrator himself sees a vision of Christ carrying the cross. Baumoff screams some of Christ's last words on the cross, "Eloi, Eloi, Lama Sabachthani?" ("My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?")
As the pain of his self-inflicted torture reaches its maximum, a gasping Baumoff cries out Christ's words again. The cry is repeated a second time, but this time by a mocking, demonic voice. In the darkness, the building shakes, and the narrator is knocked unconscious. When he awakens, he finds Baumoff dead, his face distorted. The rational explanation is heart failure, but the narrator cannot help believing that Baumoff's blasphemy may have invited in a demonic force. We are left to ponder the implications of this strange weapon, wondering if other (willing, or unwitting) "soldiers of Christ" are being readied for torture and death.

Telaga

Telaga is a land-owning agrarian community primarily found in the Coastal Andhra region of India. Telaga is a subcaste of the Kapu community, with both terms often used interchangeably. They are classified as a Forward caste. Historically, they were a warrior caste known for their honour and bravery.
The origins of the Telaga community are linked to the Telugu Choda dynasties, particularly the Velanadu chiefs (1076–1216 CE), who ruled Coastal Andhra and gradually came to be identified as Telagas. The community commonly uses the titles Naidu and Dora. The Balija and Ontari communities are closely related to the Telagas.
In the erstwhile districts of East and West Godavari, Krishna, Guntur, and Visakhapatnam, the Telagas have long identified as Kapus, while in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts, they are still known as Telagas to differentiate them from the unrelated caste of Turpu Kapus who are also present in the same districts.
History.
Origins.
Historians like Etukuru Balaramamurthy and Chintamani Lakshmanna note that Telagas are the descendants of Telugu Choda dynasties like Durjayas of Velanadu (1076–1216 CE) who ruled Coastal Andhra. These Telugu Chodas later came to be called Telagas over a period of time.
Various sources mention Telaga as a historically military caste known for their honour and valour. They were also known as Nayakas and later Naidus. Telaga surnames ("intiperlu" in Telugu) include names of weapons apart from village names. Surnames like Tupakula (musket), Eetela (spear), Bakula (dagger), Soorakattula (knife), Katari (katar) are found among them. Telagas and Kapus of former Godavari and Visakhapatnam districts are referred to as Pedda Kapu when comparing them with Turpu Kapu.
Medieval period.
An inscription dating to 1205 CE (1127 Saka year) mentions "Teliki Kapulu", which K. Iswara Dutt interprets as referring to Telagas.
During the medieval era, many Nayakas belonged to Telaga community along with Velamas and Balijas. In the late medieval era, Telagas led the right-hand caste faction in Machilipatnam and other places of Andhra. The right-hand caste faction included Komatis and various other castes. At the end of the eighteenth century, Telagas, along with Niyogi Brahmins, were the leaders of the Maha-nad, a multi-caste secret assembly that was created to exact retribution for breaking the rules and rights of castes.
There existed Nayak (Telaga) regiments in the Vijayanagara Empire and they later joined the British army after the fall of Vijayanagara. Telagas of Bobbili served as commanders and generals in armies. They formed a major part of the Bobbili army along with Velamas in the famous Battle of Bobbili in 1757. Telagas in British army held ranks such as Major, Naik, Subedar, Jemadar, Havildar etc. When the British reduced their recruitment in the army, Telagas concentrated on agriculture.
First edition of Charles Philip Brown's "Telugu-English Dictionary" (1852) mentioned Telaga caste as equivalent to Mahanati Kapu (మహనాటి కాపు). Brown also notes that Mahanati Kapus were leaguesmen and members of the Mahanadu community.
H. A. Stuart wrote in 1891, "The Telagas are a Telugu caste of cultivators, who were formerly soldiers in the armies of the Hindu sovereigns of Telingana. This may perhaps account for the name, for it is easy to see that the Telugu soldiers might come to be regarded as the Telugus or Telagas "par excellence"". During the colonial era, they were noted to be highly Brahmanised and of a high social position.
20th century.
The early 20th century witnessed caste consciousness in various social groups of Andhra. A Telaga Mahajana Sabha happened at Railway Koduru in Kadapa district in September 1920. The first Telaga Mahasabha () was held on 7 October 1923 in Machilipatnam and declared 'we are Telagas, we are Kapus'. The second Krishna district Telaga Mahajana Sabha was held in February 1925 in Pūlla under the presidentship of the Zamindar of Vallur, Bommadevara Naganna Naidu.
In 1936, Kurma Venkata Reddi Naidu, a leading advocate and Telaga leader was appointed as the Governor of Madras Presidency, one of the only two Indians in history to have held the post. In 1937, he was elected as the Chief Minister of the Madras Presidency, which included the present-day states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu along with parts of Kerala and Karnataka.
Meraka Veedhi in Rajahmundry, Padamati Veedhi in Eluru, Srikakulam, and Bangalore were the localities of some historically prominent Telaga clans.
Geographical distribution.
Telagas are found in Coastal Andhra region in the erstwhile districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Krishna, Guntur, and Prakasam. Telagas in most districts (except Srikakulam and Vizianagaram) are referred to as Kapus in general usage. In Srikakulam and Vizianagaram, they are primarily referred to as Telagas to distinguish them from the more numerous Turpu Kapus who are a distinct caste.
Small communities of Telaga-Kapu also exist in Orissa and Kharagpur, West Bengal. In the 19th and early 20th century, Telagas were among the Telugu migrants to Burma, Malaysia, Mauritius and Fiji. Telagas were said to form the largest caste among the Telugu people of Mauritius. In recent decades, Telagas have migrated to the Anglophone countries like United States.
Telaga, a sub-caste of Kapu, has no relation to the Mudiraj and Teli castes who are sometimes referred to as Telaga.
Telaga zamindaris.
"Andhra Vignanamu" (1939) mentions Eluru, Ganapavaram and Akividu in former West Godavari district as places ruled by Telagas. They were called "Telaga-prabhuvula-seemalu" ().
In pre-independent India, Telaga-Kapu also owned various zamindari estates in Coastal Andhra. K. S. Singh noted, "In East and West Godavari districts, quite a few Telaga zamindari families exist, with extensive landholdings. Some of them were bestowed with Diwan Bahadur and Rao Bahadur titles." One of the wealthiest zamindaris in former Krishna district was the Vallur Estate of Bommadevara family. Further, Gopisetti Narayanaswami Naidu, a Telaga, was the receiver of Nidadavolu Estate.
Some of the Telaga zamindaris (samsthanams) include:
Relation to Balija.
Charles Philip Brown's "Telugu-English Dictionary" (1852) mentions Telaga-Balija (తెలగ బలిజె) as a caste name. "Castes and Tribes of Southern India" (1909) notes Telaga as a synonym for Balija in Northern Circars. Alvin Texas Fishman wrote in a 1941 study that the main body of Balijas is called Telaga. "Andhra Vignanamu" (1939) mentions four sections among Telaga caste Telagas (or Naidus), Ontaris (or Doras), Balijas, and Kapus. Mallampalli Somasekhara Sarma (1946) noted that the Telaga community has three sections Telaga (proper), Kapu, and Ontari. According to Etukuru Balarama Murthy, Balijas residing in one part of Telugu land are addressed as Telagas.
Various sources note the similarities between Kapu, Telaga, Balija, and Ontari communities and these terms are often used as synonyms. Andhra Pradesh government's Kapu Welfare and Development Corporation refers to Kapu, Telaga, Balija, and Ontari communities collectively as Kapu.
Political participation.
During the 1920s and 1930s, the Telaga community, along with other feudal landed castes, were major supporters of the Justice Party. Prominent Telaga-Kapu personalities like Raghupati Venkataratnam Naidu and Kurma Venkata Reddi Naidu were members of the Justice Party. In the government formed after the first legislative council election to Madras Presidency in December 1920, Venkata Reddy Naidu was one of the three ministers in the Cabinet. In 1936, he was appointed as the Governor of Madras Presidency, one of the only two Indians in history to have held the post. In 1937, he was elected as the Chief Minister of the Madras Presidency.
Selig S. Harrison noted that, in the 1955 legislature of what was then Andhra State, the Telagas had 16 legislators, next only to the Reddis and Kammas. He states that they formed a "newly active political force". Rokkam Lakshmi Narasimham Dora, a Telaga from Srikakulam district served as the second speaker of Andhra State Assembly from 1955 to 1956.
In 1982, Telagas joined the other Kapu castes to form the Kapunadu movement, launched in Vijayawada. The movement held annual/biannual meetings since then. For the 1983 election for the united Andhra Pradesh, the Kapus, in general, supported the newly formed Telugu Desam Party. Among the elected, the Telagas made up six legislators, compared to nine legislators belonging to other Kapu castes from the coastal districts. According to scholar Balagopal, "The Munnuru Kapus, Balijas, Telagas are collectively referred to as 'Kapus'". They attempted to consolidate into a single community, but "it has remained un-consummated".
Status.
During the colonial era, Telagas were noted to be of a high social position. In a 1965 study on the history of Guntur district, Robert Eric Frykenberg called Telaga, "a high caste with a tradition of military and police employment." He also categorized them among "elite agricultural (warrior) castes." In 1976, Christopher John Baker in his work on South Indian political history called Telaga, "a respectable cultivator caste of Andhra." In 1982, Barbara D. Miller of Syracuse University noted, "Generally the Telaga-Kapu rank fairly high in status".
Telagas are a community of land-owners and are one of the dominant communities of Andhra Pradesh. In recent years, Telaga along with other related Kapu communities launched an agitation demanding quotas. However, the quota accorded to Kapus was found to be legally untenable. As of 2023, Telagas do not avail any caste-based quotas or reservations and are classified as a Forward caste both by the Central Government of India as well as the Andhra Pradesh Government.

BioModels is a free and open-source repository for storing, exchanging and retrieving quantitative models of biological interest created in 2006. All the models in the curated section of BioModels Database have been described in peer-reviewed scientific literature.
The models stored in BioModels' curated branch are compliant with MIRIAM, the standard of model curation and annotation. The models have been simulated by curators to check that when run in simulations, they provide the same results as described in the publication. Model components are annotated, so the users can conveniently identify each model element and retrieve further information from other resources.
Modellers can submit the models in SBML and CellML. Models can subsequently be downloaded in SBML, VCML , XPP, SciLab, Octave, BioPAX and RDF/XML. The reaction networks of models are presented in some graphic formats, such as PNG, SVG and graphic Java applet, in which some networks were presented by following Systems Biology Graphical Notation. And a human readable summary of each model is available in PDF.
Content.
BioModels is composed of several branches. The curated branch hosts models that are well curated and annotated. The non-curated-branch provides models that are still not curated, are non-curatable (spatial models, steady-state models etc.), or too huge to be curated. Non-curated models can be later moved into the curated branch. The repository also hosts models which were automatically generated from pathways databases.
All the models are freely available under the Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication, and can be easily accessed via the website or Web Services. One can also download archives of all the models from the EBI FTP server.
BioModels announced its 31st release on June 26, 2017. It now publicly provides 144,710 models. This corresponds to 1,640 models published in the literature and 143,070 models automatically generated from pathway resources.

Binary erasure channel

In coding theory and information theory, a binary erasure channel (BEC) is a communications channel model. A transmitter sends a bit (a zero or a one), and the receiver either receives the bit correctly, or with some probability formula_1 receives a message that the bit was not received ("erased") .
Definition.
A binary erasure channel with erasure probability formula_1 is a channel with binary input, ternary output, and probability of erasure formula_1. That is, let formula_4 be the transmitted random variable with alphabet formula_5. Let formula_6 be the received variable with alphabet formula_7, where formula_8 is the erasure symbol. Then, the channel is characterized by the conditional probabilities:
Capacity.
The channel capacity of a BEC is formula_10, attained with a uniform distribution for formula_4 (i.e. half of the inputs should be 0 and half should be 1).
If the sender is notified when a bit is erased, they can repeatedly transmit each bit until it is correctly received, attaining the capacity formula_10. However, by the noisy-channel coding theorem, the capacity of formula_10 can be obtained even without such feedback.
Related channels.
If bits are flipped rather than erased, the channel is a binary symmetric channel (BSC), which has capacity formula_14 (for the binary entropy function formula_15), which is less than the capacity of the BEC for formula_16. If bits are erased but the receiver is not notified (i.e. does not receive the output formula_17) then the channel is a deletion channel, and its capacity is an open problem.
History.
The BEC was introduced by Peter Elias of MIT in 1955 as a toy example.

Treaty of Copenhagen (1441)

The Treaty of Copenhagen (or the Peace of Copenhagen) was signed in 1441 between the Hanseatic League and the Burgundian Netherlands, ending the Dutch-Hanseatic War.
The accord was developed after Christopher of Bavaria crushed a great peasant uprising in Northern Jutland. The treaty broke the attempted monopoly of Baltic trading routes by the Hanseatic League. Even though Hanseatic trade regulations did not change, the Dutch (with their larger trading vessels) increased their control on herring fisheries, the French salt trade, and the Baltic grain trade.
In short, the Baltic Sea was open and influenced by Dutch traders. The Hanseatic merchants eventually became middlemen whereby they transported bulk goods (i.e. lumber, grain, fish) from the Baltic and exchanged them for textiles and other finished products. The treaty did not affect the control of Hanse trading outposts in London, Bruges, Danzig, and Bergen. Based on the terms of the agreement, Dutch towns promised to pay or return twenty-two lost Prussian and Livonian ships. Moreover, the Dutch would pay 5,000 guldens to the Danish king to maintain their trading privileges in Denmark, as well as pay the damages they made to Wendish towns.

Macauley's Theatre

Macauley's Theatre was the premier theatre in Louisville, Kentucky during the late 19th and early 20th century. It opened on October 18, 1873, on the north side of Walnut Street between Third and Fourth Streets, and was founded by Bernard "Barney" Macauley, a prominent Louisville actor since the 1850s. The theater was designed by architect John B. McElfatrick. It opened with the comedy "Extremes". Debts forced him to sell the playhouse to his brother John in 1879.
The theatre was a success under John Macauley, featuring the top actors of the day, such as Sarah Bernhardt, Lillie Langtry, Edwin Booth, George M. Cohan and showman Buffalo Bill. Louisvillian Mary Anderson made her debut at the theatre in 1875 while the actress Alice Oates and her company appeared there four times between 1876 and 1879.
With changing times, Macauleys began to occasionally show motion pictures in the 1910s. It continued to serve as Louisville's premier live theatre however, until it was razed in 1925. The final performance was of "The Naughty Wife" on August 29, 1925. Theatre in Louisville lived on at the 1,400-seat Brown Theatre, which opened in 1925 and rechristened as The Macauley Theatre from 1971 to 1998. Before closing its doors in 1998, the world renowned jam band Phish played two different shows across a four-month period in 1993, which is unheard of in today's music wheelhouse.
Macauley's lobby was decorated with pictures of the famous actors and actresses who had performed there, many with personal inscriptions and dedications. When the theatre closed, these were donated to the University of Louisville, which still includes them in their archives.

Biceps reflex

Biceps reflex is a deep tendon reflex (DTR) test (also known as a muscle-stretch reflex test) that examines the function of the C5 reflex arc and the C6 reflex arc. The test is performed by using a tendon hammer to quickly depress the biceps brachii tendon as it passes through the cubital fossa. Specifically, the test activates the stretch receptors inside the biceps brachii muscle which communicates mainly with the C5 spinal nerve and partially with the C6 spinal nerve to induce a reflex contraction of the biceps muscle and jerk of the forearm.
A strong contraction indicates a "brisk" reflex, and a weak or absent reflex is known as "diminished". Brisk or absent reflexes are used as clues to the location of neurological disease. Typically, brisk reflexes are found in lesions of upper motor neurons, and absent or reduced reflexes are found in lower motor neuron lesions.
A change in the biceps reflex indicates pathology at the level of musculocutaneous nerve, segment C5/6 or at some point above it in the spinal cord or brain.

Lynn Toler

Lynn Candace Toler (born October 25, 1959) is an American lawyer, judge, television arbitrator, and television presenter, best-known for her role as arbitrator on "Divorce Court". With her 14 seasons on the show, between 2006 and 2020, Toler is the longest-reigning arbitrator on the series.
Toler is also known for her co-hosting role (together with Dr. Ish Major) as a marriage mentor for the series "Marriage Boot Camp," specifically "Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars - Hip Hop Edition." To date, Toler has presented "Marriage Boot Camp" for three seasons since the show's 16th season, which began on February 6, 2020. Season 18 of "Marriage Boot Camp" premiered on October 17, 2021, and Toler was contracted to host the show for an additional 19th season as well, with the series concluding in 2022.
Early life and education.
Lynn Toler was born in Columbus, Ohio. She graduated from Columbus School for Girls, and went on to earn an undergraduate degree in English and American Literature from Harvard College (class of 1981) and a Juris Doctor from the University of Pennsylvania Law School (1984).
Career.
In 1993, at 34-years-old and after working as an attorney specializing in civil matters, Toler won her first judicial race by just six votes, as a Republican in a predominantly Democratic district. From 1994-2000, she served as Cleveland Heights Municipal Court's sole judge, with her cases involving all misdemeanor crimes, traffic violations, and minor-cost civil cases. Toler was known for enforcing non-traditional judgments, such as handwritten essays, and for creating mentoring and intervention programs. During this time, she served on many boards, including The Juvenile Diabetes Board, The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), and The Cleveland Domestic Violence Center. In 2002, she received the Humanitarian of the Year Award from the latter organization.
Between 2001 and 2006, Toler was an adjunct professor at Ursuline College in Pepper Pike, Ohio, where she taught courses on Civil Rights Law and Women's Rights.
Television and entertainment career.
Court show judge (2001-2020).
During the 2001-02 television season, Toler replaced Andrew Napolitano as the presiding judge over the nontraditional courtroom series, "Power of Attorney". The program was canceled after that television year, however, with the show as a whole only lasting two seasons.
Toler experienced much greater success within the court-show genre when she became arbitrating judge over "Divorce Court", the longest-running program in the court television genre, and one of the longest-syndicated programs of all time. Toler took over the bench beginning on September 11, 2006, with the premiere of the court show's 24th season, replacing Mablean Ephriam (of whom Toler has said she is fond and with whom Toler has had pleasant interactions). Toler would eventually become "Divorce Court"s longest-reigning judge (the series also features four other judges who have each had their tenures), presiding over the broadcast for 14 seasons. As the level-headed arbiter of "Divorce Court", Toler was frequently seen providing counsel, words of wisdom, and trying to talk sense into the show's often outrageous couples. She used her vehement expression, emphasis, and strident vocal timbre to deliver her points.
In 2007, while hosting "Divorce Court", she expanded her television presence by hosting the prime time television show and MyNetworkTV's "Decision House", a couples therapy program. In 2008 and 2009, Toler was a regular contributor on "News and Notes", a weekly news show on National Public Radio (NPR).
Toler departed "Divorce Court" after 14 years, announced publicly in March 2020. During an October 19, 2021, interview on Bailiff Byrd's "Bonding with Byrd" web series, Toler elaborated on details of her "Divorce Court" resignation, citing a list of dissatisfactions she had with production. Among them, Toler recounted efforts made by production to move the program into a more farcical, comedic direction following the popularity of her "Rolling Ray" "Divorce Court" case. Toler has also cited various other objections she had during her final season, such as the show's relocation from Los Angeles to Atlanta and a vastly altered, simulated "courtroom" set design that led to her having physical discomfort while ruling on cases. During the "Bonding with Byrd" interview, Toler also cited regular altercations with the "Divorce Court" crew, thus fueling her decision to resign from the program. Still, she has expressed grace for the opportunity to preside over the court show, which has since been presided over by Faith Jenkins (2020-2022) and Star Jones (2022-).
During her interview with Byrd, Toler added that while she didn't miss the show, as she had chosen to leave, she did miss the show in the form it was presented in prior to her final season.
Post-"Divorce Court".
Since February 2020, Toler has hosted the We TV hit series, "Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars". 
In May 2023, streaming service Allblk announced a deal with Toler where she would write and executive produce the drama Judge Me Not. The show was loosely based on her life, focusing on a Black female judge who joins an Atlanta municipal court after being elected by six votes.
Authoring career.
Toler is the author of "My Mother's Rules: A Practical Guide to Becoming an Emotional Genius", in which she describes lessons her mother, Shirley (nicknamed Toni), taught her to handle both her father Bill Toler's erratic behavior and her own inner demons. She describes how this later came in handy when dealing with emotional people from the bench. She also discusses how to apply these rules to everyday life.
In 2009, her second book, "Put it In Writing" (co-authored with Deborah Hutchison), was published. This book contains agreements for use in common but uncomfortable situations between family and friends, such as lending money, and grown children returning home.
Judge Toler is also author of "Making Marriage Work" and "Dear Sonali, Letters to the Daughter I Never had."
Personal life.
Toler resides in Mesa, Arizona. Toler and her husband, Eric Mumford, married on April 6, 1989, and Toler has two sons and four stepsons. On January 4, 2023, Judge Toler announced via social media that Eric Mumford passed away on December 23, 2022.
Though identifying as a political Independent since 2017, and having once served as an Ohio judge as a Republican, Toler has donated exclusively to candidates aligned with the Democratic Party including Jaime Harrison, Amy McGrath, and President Joe Biden.

Kosik (elephant)

Kosik (Korean: 코식; pronounced Ko-shik) is a male Indian elephant ("Elephas maximus") in the Everland theme park in Yongin, South Korea, who was born in 1990. He made headlines in September 2006 when it was discovered he could imitate the Korean words for "yes" (네), "no" (아니요), "sit" (앉아), "lie down" (누워), and four other words. He makes the sounds by putting his trunk in his mouth and shaking it while exhaling, similar to the way a human whistles with fingers in their mouth. Kwon Su-wan, director of the zoo in Seoul, said: "We plan to conduct further studies with keepers, veterinarians and scientists on whether Kosik understands the meaning of these words as he speaks them."
Like most cases of talking animals, claims are subject to the observer-expectancy effect, which may be a meaningless form of mimicry and which are subject to fabrication for many reasons.

XHTVM-TDT

XHTVM-TDT (channel 40) is a television station in Mexico City, owned by Televisora del Valle de México and operated by TV Azteca. It is branded as and available over the air in much of Mexico on TV Azteca's transmitters. Programming generally consists of news and informational shows.
History.
Concession, sign-on and early years.
On June 28, 1991, the "Diario Oficial de la Federación" announced that channel 40 in Mexico City was open to be an independent commercial television station. The new station would have its transmitter located on Cerro del Chiquihuite, and it would have an effective radiated power of 5,000 kW; a call sign of XHEXI-TV, never to be used on air, was also assigned at this time. The availability of a new television station in Mexico City, for the first time in decades, attracted high-powered media companies aspiring to enter the television business. Of 18 total applicants, 10 qualified for the concession for the new television station. Among the competitors were Francisco Aguirre Gómez of Grupo Radio Centro, Rafael Cutberto Navarro of Radio Cadena Nacional, Grupo Siete Comunicación, and other owners of radio stations.
On September 23 of that year, Televisora del Valle de México, S.A. ("Broadcaster of the Valley of Mexico"), a company 95% owned by Javier Moreno Valle and 5% by Hernán Cabalceta, was selected to receive the concession to operate the television station on channel 40. While it was stated at the time that channel 40 would go on the air in the first half of 1992, the start of regular operations would not occur for another three years. By the time the concession was formally issued on April 19, 1993, the effective radiated power had changed to 3,190 kilowatts, and the station had a new call sign: XHTVM-TV.
XHTVM signed on for good on June 19, 1995, with landscape videos set to classical music. It was the first new television station in Mexico City since XHIMT-TV took to the air a decade earlier, its second UHF, and the first new commercial station since XHTM-TV and XHDF-TV signed on in 1968. Soon after, actual programming began under the name CNI Canal 40, "CNI" being an acronym for (News and Information Corporation). As CNI, XHTVM concentrated on news and discussion programming, along with some general entertainment shows and infomercials. Its association with the new Telenoticias network gave it access to Telenoticias's 123 correspondents and 400 reporters around the world.
In 1996, CNI moved its staff to the 40th and 41st floors of the World Trade Center Mexico City. CNI secured the facilities after eight months of negotiations. The contract allowed CNI to rent for 10 years and then buy the facility at a cost of $12 million.
In 1997, CNI faced a boycott from major advertisers when it aired a story investigating the evidence against Father Marcial Maciel, founder of the Legion of Christ movement. The Legionaries refused to comment but, according to Moreno Valle, "started pressing through every channel they could" in an attempt to keep the story off the air. Roberto Servitje, part of the family controlling Grupo Bimbo, called for a boycott of the station, as did the powerful Monterrey businessman Alfonso Romo. Moreno Valle also received a call from a friend of his at Televisa. This situation partially soured XHTVM's ability to garner advertisers in the long run.
The CNI-Azteca deal and the beginning of the conflict.
On July 29, 1998, CNI partnered with TV Azteca, becoming "Azteca 40", TV Azteca's third station. Under this partnership, CNI would carry programming provided by TV Azteca, including its news and entertainment programming, while TV Azteca sold the advertising time; Azteca loaned CNI $40 million. On September 1, Azteca took over programming almost all of XHTVM's broadcast day, while CNI produced the 9:30pm-midnight time slot, featuring CNI Noticias, the station's flagship newscast with Ciro Gómez Leyva and Denise Maerker. The contract allowed Azteca to buy 51% of XHTVM if the deal were to be broken.
Briefly in 1999, Azteca secured a contract with MVS Comunicaciones to broadcast MVS's morning newscast, , on XHTVM. The simulcast lasted only one month; MVS had an exclusivity contract with DirecTV, and CNI programs were broadcast on competitor SKY México, which broke the contract.
On July 16, 2000, Moreno Valle unilaterally broke the contract with TV Azteca in an announcement on the program "Séptimo Dia" with Gómez Leyva, removing the network's programming from the air. Moreno Valle believed TV Azteca was filling up the time allotted to his CNI with leftover TV Azteca programs and accused Azteca of not complying with the contracts the two parties had signed. He also believed that Azteca was intentionally attempting to not generate profits, and by doing so, ruin CNI and the station to later buy it. In addition, Moreno Valle noted that the contracts had still not been approved by Mexican communications regulators. As a result, TV Azteca sued Moreno Valle for breach of contract and removed Moreno Valle from its administrative council.
In January 2001, the International Court of Arbitration in Paris announced it would hear the case of XHTVM.
In March 2001, a judge in Mexico City ordered the creation of a trust to enable Azteca to purchase 51% of the station; another ruling under which CNI was to pay $34 million to Azteca was issued three months later.
XHTVM broadcast 40 games of the 2002 FIFA World Cup under an agreement made with DirecTV, who owned the broadcast rights. DirecTV sold the ad time, while CNI received a cut of earnings and added other programs relating to the tournament.
In July 2002, TV Azteca filed a suit in Mexican federal court against CNI, hoping to take the company into bankruptcy reorganization ("concurso mercantil"), claiming that CNI still owed Azteca $15 million of the original 1998 line of credit. In addition, CNI held debts with the World Trade Center, BBC Worldwide Americas, Channel Four International and Deutsche Welle, which supplied some programs.
The "chiquihuitazo".
On December 27, 2002, TV Azteca used armed guards to take over the station and its transmitting facilities at Cerro del Chiquihuite. At 2 am, 20 people wearing hoods and ski masks entered the facilities, covering the faces of the workers on site, forcing them to sign a document, and making them leave. At 6 am on that day, the CNI signal was switched to a simulcast of Azteca 13, and at 6:30 pm that evening, the CNI signal on DirecTV Mexico, which was not obtained over the air, began to display a message informing satellite viewers of the transmitter takeover. It used two legal rulings, including one ambiguous judgment from the International Court of Arbitration in Paris, that declared the CNI-Azteca contract valid as justification. CNI, in the meantime, was flooded with phone calls to its headquarters on the 40th floor of the World Trade Center Mexico City; its engineers on another level of the building were astonished as they watched monitors in the facility showing Azteca 13's signal in place of their own. WTC security guards told a TV Azteca reporter filing a story from the facility that he could not record a report there. A producer exclaimed, "This is like September 11!" as he ran across the facility with copies of statements to be released to the media.
XHTVM continued to simulcast Azteca 13 for several days, eventually gaining its own program schedule on December 31. Azteca even aired one edition of "Informativo 40", a news program hosted by Sergio Sarmiento, in an attempt to give the reclaimed channel 40 some continuity and normalcy; unaware of the legal battle surrounding the channel, the country's Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía even placed advertising on the newscast. Jorge Fernández Menéndez, a journalist who had worked for CNI said that Azteca had planned this move, noting that he, along with Maerker, Gómez Leyva and others, were offered jobs at TV Azteca in the run-up to the forced takeover; all three of them rejected the offers. Azteca also placed ads in some of Mexico's major daily newspapers soliciting former CNI workers to join Azteca's operation; they declined, countering with their own print ad the next day.
The Mexican government was extremely slow to react. Owing to the timing of the events around the Christmas holiday, neither the RTC (General Directorate of Radio, Television and Film) nor the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation did anything, despite petitions from CNI and Azteca alike for the federal government to take a position on the takeover. On January 6, during a visit to the remodeled press room at Los Pinos, CNI subdirector of news Roberto López Agustín approached President Vicente Fox and demanded that he take a stand on the issue. On his way to the presidential plane, other reporters asked questions about the XHTVM situation. Fox, however, merely said, "¿Y yo por qué?" ("And why me?"), leading to one of his greatest political blunders in his tenure as president.
After the end of holiday celebrations, the RTC and SCT took the matter into their own hands. On January 6, in an 11 pm press conference, the SCT announced that if no settlement between Azteca and CNI were to be reached, the government would seize control of the station. (The SCT also considered solving another problem, a dispute over XHRAE channel 28, by giving TV Azteca that frequency and leaving CNI as the sole operator of channel 40).
At Cerro del Chiquihuite, a negotiating session with Moreno Valle, TV Azteca head Ricardo Salinas Pliego and mediators including the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Communications and Transportation began at midnight; at this point, XHTVM immediately began to broadcast color bars. A three-day negotiation period began, and on the evening of January 9, at the start of newscasts on both Azteca and Televisa, it was announced that no agreement had been reached and that the government would seize all XHTVM installations, including the transmitter site; later, it was stated that this was done because an entity (TV Azteca) that was not the concessionaire (Televisora del Valle de México) was operating the station. On the 27th, five days after the Mexican Congress passed a resolution calling for the restoration of channel 40 to CNI, CNI resumed control of the channel and of its transmission facilities. The events related to the transmitter site became popularly known as the "". Meanwhile, CNI and TV Azteca continued to negotiate in hopes of reaching a deal; even though CNI offered to pay Azteca US$25,000,000 ($ in dollars), Azteca rejected CNI's offer.
Azteca was fined 210,000 pesos (roughly US$25,000 in 2013 dollars) by the SCT after the incident.
2003–2005: Third CNI era.
CNI continued to broadcast varied programs. In addition to its newscasts, it carried "Sex and the City" and produced and transmitted the football matches of Club León.
In October 2003, CNI put XHTVM up for sale: one potential buyer for what would have been a 51% stake in the network was Isaac Saba.
However, shortly after the station's crisis with TV Azteca, CNI suffered financial problems and a looming threat of a strike by its employees. At one point the government prevented government agencies—which represented a significant portion of its advertising—from buying ad time on CNI. On May 19, 2005, 300 unionized CNI employees went on strike, the first such strike in Mexico City television history, demanding US$3.6 million in back pay. The station was forced off the air by this strike action. Valle had his own legal troubles: on June 29, an arrest warrant was issued in the United States for Moreno Valle for evading some US$297,000 in taxes in addition to claims by Mexico's Tax and Finance Secretariat that XHTVM owed $19 million in unpaid taxes. Valle was arrested in Houston, Texas on November 9, 2005. The country's then-Attorney General Daniel Cabeza de Vaca asked the United States to extradite Valle to México. General Electric México loaned $5 million to CNI and was willing to help ease its financial woes, but the Mexican government blocked the loan due to its stance against foreign ownership of broadcasters; in fact, Azteca sued, claiming XHTVM defrauded its creditors by accepting a loan that they might not be able to guarantee. The union additionally would not accept payment until the loan was validated. At the same time, Azteca recognized Cabalceta, who owned 5% of Televisora del Valle de México, as the sole administrator, and the two negotiated the sale of the 51% of the station that Azteca allegedly had the option to buy.
2005–17: Azteca's Proyecto 40.
On September 19, 2005, the Juez Séptimo Civil del Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Distrito Federal (Seventh Civil Court of the Superior Court of Justice for the Federal District) ruled that TV Azteca could operate XHTVM.
After several legal mistrials against Moreno Valle, XHTVM returned to the air in early 2006 under a new name, "Proyecto 40" (Project 40). It aired a cultural and news-oriented slate similar to CNI, while also adding entertainment programs in later years. Its news division operated separately from that of the main TV Azteca news division, only sharing a few of their journalists and hosts. In late November 2007, Valle's lawyers sued TV Azteca for illegally using XHTVM, and in late 2011, Javier Quijano Baz, lawyer for Televisora del Valle de México, published an open letter to the Public Registrar of Property in Mexico City, outlining a resolution favorable to Moreno Valle. A federal judge had ordered Azteca to respect a shareholders' meeting of Televisora del Valle de México held on September 12, 2005, that affirmed Moreno Valle as controller of TVM. Azteca, however, believed that according to a "recurso de amparo" from 2007, it had the legal right to continue operating XHTVM; it also argued that Moreno Valle, due to his legal troubles, was not in a position to be able to retake control of the channel.
In 2006, as a result of the Televisa Law, the station's concession, which would have expired in April 2008, was extended to 2021.
In July 2013, a judge reactivated the arrest warrant for Javier Moreno Valle, which had been suspended. The suspension was lifted because Moreno Valle had not paid 15 million pesos. He also had failed to pay 6 million pesos of both value-added tax and income tax. The reactivated arrest warrant can be executed by Mexico's Federal Police, though he currently resides in the United States.
In August 2014, Televisora del Valle de México received approval to change its legal status, from S.A. de C.V. to S.A.P.I. de C.V. (Sociedad Anónima Promotora de Inversión de Capital Variable).
2017–present: adn40.
On March 12, 2017, at 9pm, a special program aired announcing the "evolution" of Proyecto 40. The next morning, at 6am, regular programming began of the rebranded XHTVM, now known as "adn40". The rename accompanied a relaunch of the channel with new sets and a revamped program lineup.
Programming.
adn 40's program lineup primarily consists of news and discussion programs as well as documentaries. Major news programs on adn40 include "Primer Café", which airs in the mornings, and "Es Tendencia", an afternoon news program. On weeknights, Hannia Novell anchors the flagship "Es Noticia" bulletin, which is aired at 8 pm.
Previously, as Proyecto 40, XHTVM aired more general entertainment programming. TV Azteca and Showtime in the United States signed an agreement in September 2008 under which Proyecto 40 began to carry "Dexter", "Nurse Jackie" and other Showtime programs.
Technical information.
Subchannels.
The station's signal is multiplexed:
In April 2017, Azteca was authorized to drop the 2-hour timeshift feed of Azteca Uno from 40.2 in favor of Azteca Noticias, which had previously been on XHIMT 7.2. Ultimately, Azteca chose to retain the existing programming.
Analog-to-digital conversion.
XHTVM requested channel 41 in December 2006 to build its digital facilities; the next year, Azteca instead petitioned for channel 26, to put all three of its Mexico City stations on adjacent channels. Until 2015, when Azteca built final, high-powered digital facilities for its Mexico City stations, XHTVM's analog and digital facilities were on different towers. The XHTVM analog signal originated from the purpose-built channel 40 site; XHTVM-TDT's transmitter was co-located with those of XHIMT-TV/TDT and XHDF-TV/TDT.
When final digital facilities were built for XHTVM in 2015, its digital signal moved to the original channel 40 tower. The new facilities increased XHTVM's effective radiated power from 71.4 to 513.05 kW, the highest of any digital television station in Mexico. At midnight on December 17, 2015, XHTVM and other Mexico City stations ceased analog broadcasts. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 26, using virtual channel 40.
Repeaters.
XHTVM has three co-channel repeaters:
Availability outside Mexico City.
CNI's only full-time availability outside Mexico City was on cable and satellite systems. However, its news programs were aired on several stations, including a number of independent stations in northern Mexico such as XHIJ, XHILA and XHPNW; Multimedios Televisión in Monterrey; and the state networks of Campeche (TRC) and Yucatán (Canal Trece). Stations listed as "coming soon" included XHRBT-TV, a never-built station on channel 42 at Río Bravo, Tamaulipas whose concession was obtained by an affiliate of Javier Moreno Valle in 1999, and an unknown "channel 38" for Puebla, Cuernavaca and Toluca.
Broadcast coverage of Proyecto 40 was first extended outside Mexico City in November 2012, when 16 Azteca Trece transmitters in major cities began carrying Proyecto 40 in SD as a second subchannel.
With the digital television transition completed, in 2016, TV Azteca applied to the Federal Telecommunications Institute to add Proyecto 40 to 29 additional transmitters, three of which (Pachuca, Morelia and Zamora) carry Azteca 7; these Azteca 7 stations were changed to a+ in May 2018. Another 28 transmitters were added in 2017.
On December 13, 2017, the IFT deemed that as a result of being multiplexed on dozens of Azteca transmitters and thus having coverage of 67% of the population of Mexico, carriage of adn40 should be made mandatory for satellite providers.
As almost all of adn40's carriage is on Azteca Uno transmitters, it appears as subchannel 1.2 for most viewers outside the Mexico City area.

Sant'Egidio, Rome

Sant'Egidio is a convent church in Trastevere, Rome. Sant'Egidio (St. Giles) is the patron saint of hermits.
The church was founded in 1630 and was abandoned by the nuns in 1971. In 1973, it was occupied by the Community of Sant'Egidio, which had been founded in 1968, and was still looking for a meeting place of its own. The community, which had not had a name before, then chose to name itself after its church.
Together with the adjacent former Carmelite monastery, the church forms the seat of the Community of Sant'Egidio.

Phlog

A phlog, also called an rlog, is a type of daybook, similar to a blog, that runs off a Gopher protocol server. These phlogs are typically hosted from home servers running some sort of UNIX operating system, because a user account on the server is usually required to update the content. There are quite a few phlogs floating around gopherspace but the vast majority are not updated regularly.
Phlogs usually arranged as a directory structure with the title or date of each entry, has a separate folder for archives. It is possible to have a few sentences under each link to a blog entry as a summary, or to host the phlog as one single text or HTML file; however, HTML files cannot be read by some pure gopher clients.
Most phlogs are maintained by hand as a series of text files. Open source software exists to convert posts from a WordPress blog into plain text files that can be accessed using the gopher protocol.
The word "phlog" is derived from "blog" but with the "ph" from "gopher" instead of the "b" from "web" and appears to have been coined by Jeff Woodall on April 22, 2003.
Gopherlog.
A phlog can also be known as a gopherlog. The first known usage of the term "gopherlog" was by George Hotelling as an April Fool's Day joke on April 1, 2005.

Ireland men's national basketball team

The Ireland men's national basketball team () represents the island of Ireland in international basketball. It is governed by Basketball Ireland with players from both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Ireland plays their home matches at the National Basketball Arena in Tallaght, Dublin.
Ireland has little history on the international stage, as they have yet to qualify for top tournaments such as the EuroBasket or the FIBA World Cup. However, the national team did participate at the Summer Olympics once, in 1948.
History.
The Amateur Basketball Association of Ireland (ABAI; now Basketball Ireland) was formed in 1945 and affiliated to FIBA in 1947. An indoor version of basketball had been played in the Irish Army from 1936, but using non-standard rules to create an indoor winter substitute for Gaelic football; until 1943, the Army Athletic Council officially recognized only Gaelic games. The ABAI sent a team of the best Army players to the 1948 Olympic tournament in nearby London, despite the refusal of Army command to release the players for intensive training. The team coaches were officers unfamiliar with the sport, who outranked the players and ignored their advice. Although many top sides were absent from the London Games in the aftermath of World War II, the Irish team finished last, losing every match heavily; the worst a 71–9 loss to Mexico, who finished fourth. Only two members of the team were over tall.
The team's standard improved gradually from the 1970s to the 2000s, as more school leavers won scholarships to play US college basketball, and some Irish American professional players took up eligibility to compete for their ancestral country. Ireland entered European-zone Olympic qualification tournaments in 1972, 1976, 1984, and 1988, losing every match each time. In 1988, Ireland finished runner-up in the inaugural Promotion Cup, the third tier of EuroBasket, later named EuroBasket Division C, and now the FIBA European Championship for Small Countries. In 1993, the National Basketball Arena opened in Dublin, which became the team's new permanent home. Division C was hosted there the following year, and Ireland beat Cyprus 81–78 in the final to gain promotion to EuroBasket Division B. Ireland narrowly failed to win promotion to Division A in FIBA EuroBasket 2005 Division B, losing to Denmark by four points after having won the first game in Dublin by ten.
In February 2010, during the Irish financial crisis, Basketball Ireland announced that it was €1.2m in debt and was deactivating its senior international squads to cut costs. In December 2015, the team was reactivated for 2016.
In December 2015, it was announced that Ireland would play at the 2016 FIBA European Championship for Small Countries. The team finished in the fourth position overall.
Ireland played in the 2018 FIBA European Championship for Small Countries, held in San Marino from 26 June to 1 July. Ireland finished (1–1) in group play, losing to Malta then defeating Andorra. In the semi-finals Ireland lost to Norway, sending the team to the bronze medal match where they defeated Gibraltar to finish in third place.
Three years later, Ireland hosted the 2021 FIBA European Championship for Small Countries in Dublin. The national team would go undefeated during the tournament at (4–0), to capture their second title at the competition all time. 
After Ireland's 2021 European Championship for Small Countries triumph, they entered EuroBasket 2025 Pre-Qualifying, where they earned a victory in their first match away to Cyprus 73–81. Although following the win, Ireland would go (3–6) during the rest of their pre-qualifying campaign, to eventually be eliminated.
Ireland then put their focus into the 2027 FIBA World Cup European Pre-Qualifiers. However, they began their campaign with two demoralising losses, before sweeping their doubleheader in November 2024, against Azerbaijan and Kosovo. Ultimately, a heavy defeat at the hands of Switzerland 85–54 in February 2025, ended Ireland's hopes of progressing to the next round.

Tigers in India

Tigers in India constitute more than 70% of the global population of tigers. Tigers have been officially adopted as the national animal of India on the recommendation of the National Board for Wildlife since April 1973. In popular local languages, tigers are called "baagh", "puli" or "sher". The Bengal Tiger ("Panthera tigris tigris" [NCBI:txid74535]) is the species found all across the country except Thar desert region, Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Kutch region. These can attain the largest body size among all the Felidae, and therefore are called "Royal" Bengal Tigers. Skin hides measuring up to 4 meters are recorded. The body length measured from its nose to the tip of the tail can reach up to 3 meters and it can weigh up to 280 kilograms, with males being heavier than females. Their average life expectancy is about 15 years. However, they are known to survive for up to 20 years in wild. They are solitary and territorial. Tigers in India usually hunt chital ("Axis axis"), sambar ("Cervus unicolor"), barasingha ("Cervus duvacelii"), wild buffalo ("Bubalis arnee") nilgai ("Boselaphus tragocamelus") and gaur ("Bos gaurus") and other animals such as the wild pig ("Sus scrofa") for prey and sometimes even other predators like leopards and bears. There are instances of Elephant calves ("Elephas maximus") hunted by tigers.
The tiger is estimated to have been present in India since the Late Pleistocene, for about 12,000 to 16,500 years. Tigers are found in 20 states of India with a variety of habitats including grasslands, mangrove swamps, tropical and sub-tropical forests, as well as shola forest systems and from plains to mountains over 6000 feet. The tiger is classified as Endangered in the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species. Tigers throughout the Asia are found across 12 regional tiger conservation landscapes (TCLs), of which India is home to 6 global priority TCLs for long-term tiger conservation significance, harboring more than 60% of the global genetic variation in the tiger species.
India is one of the founding members of the intergovernmental platform of Tiger Range Countries – Global Tiger Forum headquartered in New Delhi. With a global share of 17% human population and 18% livestock population within 2.4% land area of the world, India has conserved the single largest population of free ranging wild tigers in the world, effectively trying to reverse a century of decline. Several initiatives in the form of amendments to the Wildlife Protection Act, creating the "National Tiger Conservation Authority", delineating inviolate Core Areas in Tiger Reserves and incentivised voluntary relocation program, among many others have been critical in securing the survival of key tiger populations, the biodiversity, and the ecosystem services of the forests they inhabit. The Project Tiger Division under Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is dedicated for conservation efforts in a scientific way using advanced technological tools. The Government of India increased the budget allocation for tiger conservation from INR 185 crore in 2014 to INR 300 crore in 2022.. India is committed to secure the livelihoods of its citizens while simultaneously minimizing its impact on its wildlife conservation goals. In 2022, 54th tiger reserve in India was declared in Ranipur Wildlife Sanctuary, Uttar Pradesh, it being the State's fourth tiger reserve.
Tigers are present in different landscapes across the country. Some landscapes have rich and viable population with adequate habitat and abundance of prey. Then are some landscapes which are prone to human interference but have potential to support improved tiger population. Unfortunately, there are some habitats where once thriving tiger population has now disappeared. As of 2020, it is estimated that nearly 30% of tiger population in India is present outside the Tiger Reserves. While other tiger range countries with relatively more economic prosperity have failed to protect this endangered species, India has lived up to its global commitment for tiger conservation and achieved the target of doubling its population (TX2) ahead of the set time-frame. Despite all the odds ranging from population stress to the demands of development and livelihoods, India has successfully managed to achieve the fine balance between modernization and conservation owing to the people's traditional, cultural and religious tolerance to all forms of life that cohabit with them.
Tiger occupancy increased by 30% between 2006 and 2018 to about , mainly by improving anti-poaching control, extension of protected areas, fostering coexistence in multi-use areas, and economic incentives to local people.

In India, it is known by different names in different languages
Characteristics.
Tiger is a large, heavy bodied cat with dominant shade of reddish-orange (pale yellow ochre to burnt sienna) and black stripes arranged irregularly, with a coat of smooth short hair. The ventral parts with chin, throat, breast and belly are generally white on colour with black stripes. In some tigers, brows and cheeks can also be white. Males have prolonged whiskers. Tigers in the plains tend to grow bigger in size compared to those in hilly areas. Tigers measuring up to 12 feet were often recorded a century ago. A full grown male can reach 10 feet in length. British Naturalist Robert Armitage Sterndale recorded of Lieutenant-Colonel Boileau hunting a 12 feet tiger in 1861. Its hide is said to have measured 13 feet 5 inches. He also mentions Colonel Ramsay killing a 12 feet tiger. There are many noted instances of tigers in India over 10 feet killed during British rule. Loss of healthy gene-pool due to excessive hunting can be attributed to relatively smaller size of present-day tigers. These big cats are in fact good swimmers. Tigers can endure thirst for substantial amount of time. In one instance recorded by British naturalist George P. Sanderson, two wounded tigers were caught in net during hot weather and they survived without water for 10 days. Tigers cannot climb but the claw markings on the tree bark can be found up to a height of 10 feet. Tigers are known to be cannibals and sometimes scavengers.
British Military Officer, Alexander Angus Airlie Kinloch, an enthusiastic tiger-hunter in his book published in 1885 observes "It is rarely that tigers become man-eaters, probably on account of there being such abundance of game and cattle for them. Unless provoked, the tiger will rarely attack a man, but does his best to get away quickly." 
Sir Samuel Baker, a Naturalist as well as a Big Game Hunter, revealed that it was rare for a tiger to attack any human being when suddenly and unexpectedly disturbed. He mentioned "The truth is that the tiger seldom attacks to actually kill, unless it is driven, or wounded in a hunt. It will frequently charge with a short roar if suddenly disturbed, but it does not intend to charge home, and a shout from a native will be sufficient to turn it aside; it will then dash forward and disappear, probably as glad to lose sight of the man as he is at his escape from danger."
Mythology and Culture.
The Mahābhārata, an epic poem of ancient India's Sanskrit literature authored by Vyāsa, having originated in Vedic Period, consists of 18 parvas (books). The fifth Parva, Udyoga Parva, has 10 parts and 199 chapters. One of its shloka reads निर्वनो वध्यते व्याघ्रो निर्व्याघ्रं छिद्यते वनम् ।तस्माद्व्याघ्रो वनं रक्षेद्वनं व्याघ्रं च पालयेत् ॥
"nirvanō vadhyatē vyāghrō nirvyāghraṁ chidyatē vanamtasmādvyāghrō vanaṁ rakṣēdvanaṁ vyāghraṁ ca pālayēt."
which can be translated as 
 Do not cut down that forest with its tigers! Let not the tigers be driven from that forest! There can be no forest without tigers, and no tigers without a forest. The forest shelters the tigers and tigers guard the forest!
This philosophy holds true in present times as well. Tiger is admired and feared alike in Indian mythology. Goddess Shakti (Durga) rides on the tiger. Many deities across the country such as Dingu-Aneni (in North-East India), Bonbibi (in West Bengal), Sabarimala Ayyappan (in Kerala), Huliraya (in Karnataka), Vaghdeo or Vaghoba (in Maharashtra) and Chandraghanta are associated and venerated with tiger. Puranas and folklore often mention tiger as "vahana" for many of the religious figures. The Matsya Purana while narrating Shiva's marriage with Sati, describes some of the Ganas, the Shiva's attendants, having a face resembling that of a tiger. Harivamsa Purana often uses qualities of a tiger as adjectives. 
One Buddhist mythological tale suggest that Gautama Buddha in his past incarnation presented himself to a tigress as food when she was about to cannibalize her own cubs. This highlights compassion, the greatest virtue in Buddhist philosophy. Taoism depicts tiger as one of its prominent element in its temples.
Tiger images can be seen in the cave paintings from mesolithic era found in the archaeological site of Bhimbetka rock shelters. Tiger featured on the seals discovered in Mohenjodaro and Kalibangan shows its significance in the ancient Indus civilization and culture. Earliest known pictorial depiction of Shiva wearing tiger skin are from Kushana Period. Tiger holds religious and cultural significance for many adivasis in India. Kharia, Bhaina, Savar (or Saur), Parja tribes and Kusro sept in the state of Madhya Pradesh has totems of tiger. Baigas consider tiger as their brother. Gonds are known for propitiating the tiger as they see it as a protector. Korku worships Baghdeo (Tiger God). For the Murias, Chitan Deo (Tiger God) is the god of good hunting. Bhagashwar (Tiger God) is worshiped by the Bharias with a belief that they won't be killed by a tiger. Koyas people consider Konarzu as their Tiger God. It is a well known fact that tribal people who share their lands with this top predator abstain from killing them as they consider it to be sacred. Traditionally, India has always had a culture of conserving forests and the wildlife in its nature.
Hunting of tigers by Islamic Invaders can be traced back to the Mughal cultural links with Mongol and Timurid ancestry which practiced hunting of big cats (lions, in their region) as a ritual "to formalise any kind of authority" and considered killing them as a good omen for the kingdom. Conversely, if the hunting was unsuccessful and the animal escaped, it would invite trouble for the kingdom.
Foreign naturalists identified that tigers were regarded by the natives with a divine awe which prevented its killing by locals, even when they had power. European religious magazines and publications played crucial role for introducing tigers to their youth and children. While promptly acknowledging being unknown to this "terrific animal" which was "not an inhabitant of bible land", English missionaries when passing through jungles "for the purpose of preaching the gospel to, and distributing religious books, among the poor benighted heathen" often encountered what they called "most savage and destructive of animals". On confronting this big cat, many a times they would lose the life of their fellow missionaries. Then would ask to the readers back in their country "What do you think it was? Why, it was the body of the poor man who had been killed. ... It was, indeed, a horrid and painful sight, and one which I shall never forget. On looking at it my blood seems to curdle in my veins. ... Youthful reader, did you ever feel thankful that you were born in a country where you are not in danger of being killed and eaten by those cruel and blood thirsty beasts?" 
Missionaries would also point out that "In many places, the inhabitants appear to have resigned the dominion to the tigers, and take few precautions against them; regarding them as sacred." 
The popular myth that tigers are known to suck blood of its prey was disproved more than a century ago.
History.
Arthashastra, an ancient Indian political treatise authored by Kautilya more than two thousand years ago, mentions of "vyaala vana" (wildlife and tiger reserve) which was a protected area in the kingdom by the Royal Command. King Ashoka of the Maurya Empire rejected hunting as a royal hobby.
From time immemorial, humans and tigers have co-existed throughout India. Tiger is elusive and avoid humans under normal circumstances but never charges unless wounded, or in defence of its young cubs. However, there are instances where tigers have attacked humans and cattle as result of which villages were abandoned owing to the neighbourhood of these animals. But killing the tiger was never seen as a solution to the problem. In fact, tigers are revered and worshiped in the forests and grasslands it shared with people throughout the region.
However, the foreign invaders and rulers saw capturing or hunting of tigers as a symbol of masculinity and an adventurous sporting event. Killing of this charismatic wild animal, often considered "merciless blood sucking beast" was an extension of justifying kingship, building the empire and establishing sovereignty. Indulging in hunting of this top predator was considered as a "Royal Privilege" by Mughals through which they could exercise their authority over the native subjects and natural world. This regal sport portrayed rulers as "heroes" capable of slaying the fiercest of the beasts and destroying the "evil" lurking around. Despite the prevalence of tiger hunting as a royal sport for centuries, the consequences were larger during the British Raj due to the hunters' use of far superior firepower, and their hobby to hunt shared by a lot of colonial aristocrats led to further depletion. Hunting events were chronicled in detail by the British officers in their personal diaries, memoirs, official gazetteers and their photographs to establish extravagance and might of the British Empire in India. British rulers enacted Forest Act of 1878 which enabled them to treat forest area as hunting grounds to eradicate tigers legitimately which were subsequently labelled as vermins. Killing of tiger involved considerable danger and the hunting of a tiger had been considered a manly and a courageous feat with game, trophies being collected as the symbols of valor and prestige. Accounts of British royalty photographed aside dead tiger carcasses during the late 19th and early 20th centuries depict the construction of the successful conquest of Indian nature, thus symbolizing the imperial, masculine identities desired by the British.
In the early 19th century, Bishop Heber has written a poem for the English youth and children in which he mentions about tigers in India. "Our task is done! On Ganga's Breast The sun is sinking down to rest; And moor'd beneath the tamarind bough, Our bark has found its harbour now. With furled sail and painted side, Behold the tiny frigate ride. Upon her deck, mid-charcoal gleams, The Muslim's savoury supper steams, While all apart, beneath the wood, The Hindu cooks his simpler food. Come walk with me the jungle through; If yonder hunter told us true, Far off, in the desert dank and rude, The Tiger holds his solitude; Nor taught by secret charm to shun The thunders of the english gun; A dreadful guest but rarely seen, Returns to scare the village green." 
A manager at Isaac A. Van Amburgh's menagerie described to people in other parts of world about these tigers from India as ... "Glutting himself with the blood of his victims, he is a fit emblem of cruelty. ... though gutted with slaughter, (tiger) is not satisfied - but continues the carnage and seems to have its courage only inflamed by not finding resistance. He is the only animal whose spirit seems untamable: neither force nor constraint, violence or flattery can prevail in the least on his stubborn nature. The caresses of the keeper have no influence on his heart of iron; and time, instead of mollifying its disposition only serves to increase its fierceness and malignity. The tiger snaps at the hand that feeds it, as well as that by which it is chastised - every object seems considered only as its proper prey, which it devours with a look, although confined by bars and chains, still makes fruitless efforts as if to show its malignity when incapable of exerting its force. ... In short the beast may be said to be possessed of a devil, and no human power can instill into him the attributes of love and kindness."
Colonial rulers established postal services in India for their effective administration. To shorten the time taken to deliver the post, these men would enter into the jungles which were otherwise undisturbed by human activities. Often there were instances involving the postman being attacked by Tigers. Such tigers were brandished as Man-Eaters and hunted down by British officers.
Often the elite British rulers in India would come up with a book publication narrating the exaggerated tales of their adventurous and "valor acts" of killing the tiger catered to the English audience back home. These books largely shaped the perception of European foreigners who liked to believe that by killing the tiger they were doing a favor to the native population. Lieutenant Colonel Frank Sheffield in his widely popular book "How I Killed the Tiger" wrote, "I had the satisfaction of knowing that I had rid the community of dangerous pest. The tiger in India is looked upon as a common enemy. All classes are in mortal dread of him. ... There is, therefore, great rejoicing over the death of a tiger" The press in Britain would then eulogize these incidents of tiger shooting which gave rise to the craze of Big Game Hunting in India. Press opinions on the heroic acts of their countrymen in the colonized India were notable in Daily Chronicle, United Service Gazette, The Field, Daily News, The Graphic, Land and Water, Examiner, Standard, Hampstead &amp; Highgate Express, The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph and The Navy and Army Illustrated among others. Articles published in the press would attract young Englishmen to visit Indian subcontinent for tiger-shooting.
When the adult parent tiger was killed, cubs would be caught and sailed to the land of British. Tigers were kept as pets among few Englishmen. There are accounts of tigers being tamed and showing docile behavior. However, there have been instances when caged Tigers from the menagerie have escaped. In October 1857 a tigress escaped from confines of Charles Jamrach who has purchased a lot of animals brought from British ruled colonies on the shores of London. A 9-year-old boy playing on street was attacked and rescued. Mr. Edmonds from Birmingham later purchased this tigress for £200 (equivalent to 18,000 pound sterling in 2022) in his personal collection and put it as an exhibit with advertising "The tiger that swallowed the child in Ratcliff Highway" Later this tigress escaped to kill another Lion in Edmond's menagerie.
George P. Sanderson, a British official posted in erstwhile Mysore State, wrote "May the day be far distant when the tiger shall become practically extinct!"
Tiger fights used to be held in Lucknow during the reign of last king of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah and it is well documented that a dozen tigers were sold in market to highest bidder for ten rupees each. Tipu Sultan, the prince of Mysore state was also associated with Tiger.
In 1986, it was discovered that tigers were declining rapidly due to being poisoned, snared or shot and then smuggled out of India to supply medicinal manufacturers in China.
Chennai was earlier known as Puliyur, meaning Tiger Town. Mumbai (erstwhile Bombay) has recorded tigers in the vicinity till 1929. Major cities along the river Yamuna like Delhi and Agra once had free roaming tigers in the neighboring jungles.
Post-Indian Independence, the newly formed East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) had rich bounty of tigers in the Sundarban Districts of East Bengal. The administration advertised its plentiful natural heritage as "a sportsman's paradise". It invited people to "take part in this exciting sport" by paying a "license fee".
Habitat and Ecology.
Global tiger population is confined to only 13 countries - India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Russia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Of these, only in 8 countries can breeding tiger population be found in the wild. India, Nepal and Russia are the only countries that have successfully increased the tiger population through conservation efforts. As of 2022, the tigers are now likely to be extinct in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam.
It is an adaptable species that can survive in a wide variety of habitats and climates ranging from high mountains, mangroves swamps, tall grasslands, to dry and moist deciduous forests, as well as evergreen forests as witnessed in all over the geography of India. The reddish-orange with black stripes coat provide good camouflage in its environment. Tigers prefer a large territory, the size of which is determined by the availability of prey. It marks the territory by urine, feces, rakes, scrapes, and vocalizing. Tigers are now forced to compete for space with ever increasing human expansion. They have a tendency of using landscape features such as dirt roads, trails, foot paths, riverbeds and nullahs which often leads to public sighting.
Landscapes.
India has five major tiger occupied landscape complexes which have their own unique geographical features and population of tigers
Shivalik Hills and Gangetic Plains.
With an average width of 60 km and stretching across nearly 900 km from river Yamuna and Sharda in the west to Valmiki Tiger Reserve in the east, Shivalik and the Gangetic Plains landscape consists of three parallel geological zones - the Shivaliks, the bhabar tract and the terai plains ranging from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh to Bihar. Shivaliks are the young fold mountains with elevation up to 1500 m situated between the Himalayas and Indus-Gangetic-Brahmaputra-Irrawaddy plains. Streams from Shivalik enter underground in the bhabhar region to re-emerge again in the terai zone which is marked by annual flooding, a high water table, shifting floodplains, vast swampy areas and hence with abundant tall grass species. India and Nepal share the forests in the terai region and Bhutan is also a significant part of this zone. This makes trans-boundary co-operation in the conservation efforts important.
High density of tiger population (up to 15 tigers per 100 km2.) in this landscape can be attributed to existence of more than 15,000 km2 forested area with plenty of tiger prey base such as
Central India and Eastern Ghats.
Central Indian and Eastern Ghats landscape includes all the area from semi-arid zone of Rajasthan, central Indian plateau of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra (along with some part of Sahyadris), and Odisha to parts of the Eastern Ghats Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and Odisha Step-like geological formation can be seen at Chhota Nagpur Plateau (consisting of Hazaribagh, Ranchi and Koderma plateaus) along with the hills of Aravalli, Satpura and those in Eastern Ghats have an elevation range of 200 m to 1300 m. This hilly terrain with patches of shallow infertile soils has been a natural deterrent for extensive cultivation and hence many areas in this landscape remain forested. However, the historic continuation of ancient forests in Eastern Ghats with primitive forests of Central India along the Chhota Nagpur plateau is near extinction.
A huge network of Protected Areas with nearly half of the total Tiger Reserves of India can be seen in this landscape. Peninsular forests transitions into Thar desert through a semi-arid region located between part of north western Madhya Pradesh and Eastern Rajasthan. This varied habitat supports high biodiversity and is known for its tiger abundance. The landscape is undergoing massive degradation due to mining, infrastructure development and insurgency.
Wildlife habitats of this landscape are the most fragmented in India. With presence of four tiger populations that have more than 100 tigers each (with Kanha-Pench Block having more than 300 tigers) this landscape is home to a few endemic species such as Indian Wild Buffalo ("Bubalus arnee") and Hard Ground Barasingha ("Rucervus duvacelli branderi"). Other common prey animals here are Blackbuck ("Antilope cervicapra"), Barking deer ("Muntiacus muntjak"), Chinkara ("Gazella benetti"), Chital ("Axis axis"), Chowsingha ("Tetracerus quadricornis"), Gaur ("Bos gaurus"), Mouse Deer ("Moschiola indica"), Nilgai ("Boselaphus tragocamelus"), Sambar ("Rusa unicolor"), Wild Pig ("Sus scrofa")
The Western Ghats.
Beginning from the River Tapi in North, running parallel to the Arabian Sea coast and stretching over 1600 km to end at Kanyakumari in South, the Western Ghats landscape ranges from Goa, Karnataka and Kerala to Tamil Nadu Total forest cover is about 1,01,467 km2. and this landscape has 11 notified tiger reserves as of 2018. The highest peak at Anaimudi is 2,695 m from mean sea level. This global biodiversity hotspot with vegetation ranging from grasslands, montane stunted evergreen forests (shola), tropical wet evergreen forests, moist deciduous to dry deciduous forests and dry thorn forests, is home to about 5,800 species of flowering plants, 500 species of birds and 120 species of mammals with a large number of them being endemic to this region. Illegal Quarrying, Mining, Hydroelectric Power Projects, Deforestation for timber and agricultural output with rampant monoculture, Hunting and Encroachment are the major ecological concerns which have resulted in irreversible habitat loss, disruption of habitat corridors thereby interrupting the gene flow in tiger population. It is estimated that in Karnataka, the state with second highest tiger population of 524 (SE 475 - 573) as per 2018 assessment, about 12% of forests have been completely destroyed since the year 2000.
North Eastern Hills and Brahmaputra Flood Plains.
North Bengal Dooars, Brahmaputra Flood Plains and North Eastern Hill ranges together constitutes North Eastern Hills and Brahmaputra Flood Plains Landscape which ranges from across parts of Northern West Bengal, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland The fertile plains of Bengal Dooars are at the foothills of Eastern Himalayas and has vast tropical moist forests that extends into the Brahmaputra Valley which is about 750 km long and 80 km across surrounded by hilly terrain. This region has numerous protected areas, reserved forests and wetlands along the Brahmaputra River. The North Eastern hill region consists of eastern Himalayas extending from the Koshi Valley in Central Nepal to northwest Yunan in China and include North East India along with the hill districts of West Bengal. Garo, Khasi and Jaintia hills forms the Meghalaya plateau while located in the south-east, Mizoram has a major part of Lushai hills with Tripura having a small chunk. India-Myanmar border is along the Naga hills where as Assam is home for the Barail Range, Karbi-Anglong hills and the Cachar hills
With highly fertile land, many rivers and tributaries in the region, the mountains, valleys and the plains with an altitude ranging from 300 m to 6000 m, showcases contrasting features and a rich variety of wildlife. Tropical climate is predominant in valleys and rampant deforestation for extensive monoculture plantation threatens the survival of many endemic species found here. Apart from the usual tiger prey found in the rest of the country like Barking deer ("Muntiacus vaginalis"), Chital ("Axis axis"), Hog Deer ("Axis porcinus"), Sambar ("Rusa unicolor"), Swamp Deer ("Rucervus duvaucelii"), Water Buffalo ("Bubalus arnee") and Wild Pig ("Sus scrofa"), the tigers in this landscape also prey on Himalayan Goral ("Naemorhedus goral"), Himalayan Serow ("Capricornis thar"), Red Goral ("Naemorhedus baileyi"), Bharal ("Pseudois nayaur"), Brow-Antlered Deer ("Cervus eldi eldi"), Leaf Deer ("Muntiacus putaoensis"), Pygmy Hog ("Porcula salvania"), Ibex ("Capra ibex"), Great Tibetan Sheep ("Ovis ammon hodgsoni") and Tibetan Wild Ass ("Equus hemionus kiang"). Tigers are also known for hunting down Badgers ("Arctonyx collaris"), Otters ("Lutrogale perspicillata") and sometimes baby Elephants ("Elephas maximus"), One-horned Rhinoceros ("Rhinoceros unicornis")
With two important Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs), there are nine tiger reserves in this landscape which has a forest area of around 1,70,541 km2. Tibet Autonomous region of China, Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar are the neighboring countries that share their borders with this landscape thus making trans-boundary international cooperation an essential requirement for tiger conservation success.
Sundarban.
Sundarban landscape consists of mangrove forests of southern part of West Bengal and extends into Bangladesh This important wetland is a global priority Tiger Conservation Landscape Unit covering an area of more than 10,000 km2 which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1987. Designated as Sundarban Biosphere Reserve with around 4,266 km2 area on the Indian side of the Sundarban (34%) is under highest protection for residing wildlife in comparison with Sundarban in Bangladesh (66%) having majority of area being open to harvest the forest produce.
Aquatic systems of the mangrove habitat are highly productive among the ecosystems. With a density of 3.6 tigers per 100 km2 in Sundarban landscape, they have adapted successfully to a more amphibious, saline, pneumatophore-filled existence. This region is also known for prevalence of high numbers of Man-Eater tigers. Chital ("Axis axis"), Wild Pig ("Sus scrofa"), Rhesus macaque ("Macaca mulatta") and Lesser adjutant stork ("Leptoptilos javanicus") are the major prey for tigers in Sundarban. Other fauna found here such as Water monitor ("Varanus salvator"), young Saltwater crocodiles ("Crocodylus porosus") and possibly fish are also preyed upon by the local tigers. With rivers acting as natural geographical barriers, tigers crossing the water channels by swimming up to 400 m distance have been recorded. Being in an isolated habitat, the gene flow is highly restricted for tiger species in this landscape.
Decline.
Organized poaching due to illegal international demand for tiger parts and products is the major threat to the lives of existing tiger population. Deforestation leads to habitat loss, fragmentation of tiger population and depletion in its prey numbers which in turn increases the human-tiger conflict when tigers enter human populated areas to target cattle as its prey. Tigers are now at increased risk of zoonosis through interaction with domestic animals. Free ranging dogs in vicinity of Protected Area are considered to be threat to both ungulates (which they hunt) and to the other larger carnivores like tigers, as a carrier for infectious diseases like rabies, parvovirus, and distemper.
Drastic fall in Tiger numbers can be attributed to large scale deforestation during British empire for the timber used in establishing vast network of Railways throughout India and increased tiger-shooting.
Since 2012, records with standardized data of tiger deaths in India is being maintained by the National Tiger Conservation Authority. During the period 2017 to 2021, 547 tiger mortality instances were documented across the country. 393 tiger deaths were due to natural causes where as 25 died due to poisoning, 9 were killed from snaring, 7 were eliminated by shooting, 55 dead tigers were seized, 22 got electrocuted and 33 poaching incidences were recorded.
Killing.
A large number of tigers have been killed in medieval &amp; colonial India to prove the pride, wealth, machismo and honour of the ruling elite. Shooting tigers was "a jolly-good sport". Post-independence, from 1947, India was hotspot for global hobby-hunters which accelerated the tiger killings till the Indian government banned it in 1972. The trophy-hunting industry in India at the time of ban was worth $4 million per year (equivalent of 432.8 million as of 2022)
Shikar.
Establishment of Mughal Empire across the India saw rise in hunting the tiger as a sport for the elite. Mughal Emperor would often invite Mongol, Rajput, Turk and Afghan nobilities for Shikar of the Tiger, which was seen as worthwhile opponent who evoked fear. While the Indians worshiped as well as feared this King of the Jungle, it had to be killed by the foreign invaders as a mark of asserting supremacy during their rule. Akbar preferred hunting tigers with bow and arrow while riding on a horse back or on an elephant where as Jahangir, who is known to have killed 86 tigers, went on foot for the hunt. Jahangirnama claims Shikar of a total 28,532 animals and 13,964 birds in the hands of Jahangir with first his killing made at the age of 12. Mughals were known to maintain the records of their royal hunting expeditions (Shikar). Animal contests such as tiger vs horned buffaloes and tiger vs tiger were common during the era.
Shikar employed the Mongol hunting tactic called Qamargah, in which many men served as "beaters" for encircling a huge area to drive-out and trap the tiger in fenced spot where the ruler sitting on a horse or elephant would kill the tiger. The hunter would often keep a part of tiger as trophy or souvenir.
Once Akbar took 4000 soldiers with him for Shikar. All his courtiers, noblemen and even his harem accompanied him. Infrastructure similar to the royal palace was created in the middle of the jungle. Sometimes, the Shikar lasted for months. Many paintings were created on this theme to hail the ruler. Cock-fights and duelling of pigeons and rams were made available whenever the king felt bored. Falcons and Cheetahs were reared as pets that assisted in making Shikar a success.
The princely state of Hyderabad had a good number of tigers in its wilderness. The dignitaries visiting the Nizam were taken for Shikar. On the jubilee celebration of Nizam, the prince gifted him 35 tiger skins which were killed in a month.
Big-Game Hunting.
English naturalist Richard Lydekker in the book "The Royal Natural History" wrote, "Tiger is so intimately associated with the characteristic of India that it will always - and rightly - be regarded as the special emblem of that country"
British saw the killing of Tigers as an act of imperial subjugation of the Indian subcontinent. For the colonial rulers and British officers, the months of March, April and May was the Tiger-Hunting season as much of the grass would dry out during summer in the Northern India and chances of sighting and thus killing a tiger would be high. Big-game huntings are known to have killed around 9 tigers on an average day. They employed Shikaris (chief native trackers), Beaters along with Elephants &amp; Mahouts (elephant handler) for their hunting expedition. It was ensured all the beaters are paid by the day, and each receives a gratuity if a tiger is killed. Monetary incentives lured native people to help foreigners in hunting games. An ordinary beater received from three to four paise a day when the beats have been blank, and double that amount when there has been a kill. There were generally about fifty or sixty of them. Their leaders received double the above sums.
The roots of this animosity and thirst for killing a tiger can be traced back to incidences like one happened in 1812 - when a party of British officers dining in a jungle near Madras was attacked by a tiger - in which a life was lost. This created a lasting panic and fear among the British. At every opportunity, they would avenge this "ferocious beast". In another instance of 1792, son of Sir Hector Munro was ambushed by a tiger and mauled to death when he was out in jungle to hunt deer. Being a higher authority in the Military, his response was to take revenge by officially authorizing mass killing of tigers. Many officers were either badly wounded or killed on their Big-Game expedition. This in turn led to other officers violently taking up against the tiger.
British rulers directed native Indians to clear large areas of forests for timber and agriculture expansion. This increased the chances of man-tiger encounters which was otherwise rare. Only forest dwellers came in contact with usually shy and solitary tigers on regular basis but with no incidences of attacks. Loss of habitat and reduced number of preys often led tigers to venture out in human settlements where domestic cattle was an easy food. Increasing man-tiger conflict was seen by the British as a "problem to be solved".
William Rice, a British Army Lieutenant at 25th Regiment Bombay Native Infantry, in his journal published in 1857 mentions his "bag" consisted of 156 heads of "large game" with 98 tigers, one of which measured 11 feet and 11 inches from end of its nose, between the ears to tip of its tail. He uses terms like "fearful ravages", "rapacious pests", "India infested with wild beasts" while equating their killing to "notorious evils" requiring "remedy" and "exterminate such brutes". William Rice describes tiger-shooting as the most exciting and glorious sport this world affords and wrote 
"I enjoyed splendid opportunities of observing the habits of these animals and ascertaining how they may best be killed."
Chambers's Journal of 1875 mentions Englishmen killing about 1200 tigers annually in the Bengal Province alone, which translates to more than 3 tigers a day.
British physician Sir Joseph Fayrer notes that in 1876, Bombay Presidency spent 43,598.12 rupees in killing 1,693 "noxious" tigers that were considered as "evil to be removed" so that "wild beasts will recede, and men will no longer worship, or reverence with superstitious awe, the creature that destroys them." He mentions that Central Provinces rewarded 50 rupees for killing a "full grown" tiger. Official records from Board of Revenue of Madras Presidency in 1876 shows 236 tigers were killed by the British which was almost similar to the number of tigers killed in 1875. From 1872 to 1873, 391 tigers and before that 1866-69 an average of 186 tigers were killed each year as Madras Board of Revenue considered it "the bounden duty of government to do something for the destruction of wild animals and protection of life and property from their ravages." It rewarded up to 100 rupees for killing a tiger. Madras government briefly appointed Captain Caulfield with assistance of Inspector Mackenzie in Coimbatore district with a task of hunting down tigers in the area. The collector was instructed to ensure smooth hunting expeditions. The deputy commissioner of Buldhana in erstwhile Hyderabad State remarked that the pace of hunting has made tiger extinct in his district.
British officially killed 1,579 Tigers in the year 1878. In the year 1882, the British officials paid £4800 in rewards for killing 1,726 tigers. Col. Julius Barras who spent 28 years serving as British Army officer in colonial India, in his 1883 memoir admits aspiring to a "little amusement in the great jungles of India" and about the costs involved in big-game hunting, he wrote:
 "As nothing can be more dreary than life in an Indian military cantonment, it will surprise no one to learn that sporting incidents, such as tiger-shooting... will form the chief attraction of the present work. Tiger-shooting was my principal amusement, and, as it is an expensive pastime, I think I cannot begin better than by pointing out a few of the more costly preparations which must be made before this sport can be indulged in, and by also indicating a few contingencies that may easily arise, and cost the adventurer a good deal more than he may have anticipated. For tiger-shooting the best and most highly finished weapons are indispensable. What, for instance, is the use of the finest lock and barrels if the wood of the stock is not sufficiently seasoned to bear, without warping, the fierce heat to which it is exposed under a May sun in the hottest parts of the tropics. No; everything down to the cartridges and the lining of the coat pockets, in which most people carry them, should be carefully looked to, and no inefficiency tolerated for the sake of economy."
"Expenses such as the above can, of course, be reckoned upon before starting, but there are others of a less certain nature. Occasionally beaters are killed, and then the compensation paid to their families is often heavy. Or an elephant may be sacrificed, and then you would be expected to pay for him! But these are dismal considerations, and apt, perhaps, to damp the rising ardour! Still, if they are ever to be glanced at, surely it should be before we start on our wild career. Whatever may happen afterwards must be considered as part of the enjoyment, even if, like myself, we end in becoming crippled for life!"
In the year 1886, records show a total of 1,464 tigers were killed in British India. Lt.Col. J.C. Fife-Cookson who arrived in erstwhile India as the Adjutant of the 65th Regiment of the British Army, begins his book "Tiger-shooting in the Doon and Ulwar With Life in India" (1887) by claiming there is no sport which is equal to tiger-shooting and the skin of the tiger, considered as a valuable trophy was reward of the hunting success. On his preference of going on hunt with one or two "friends" rather than being in a large team of hunting "sportsmen" and not willing to "sacrifice personal control and management of the expedition", he wrote:
 "In tiger-hunting the scene of chase is in the beautiful and wild Indian jungles, pervaded as they are by a feeling of solitude and romance... The tiger is the most cunning animal in the jungle, and your wits are pitted against his intelligence and instinct, while the other element of danger is certainly not wanting in most of the plans of hunting him... If the sportsman has only one or two companions, he experiences the enjoyment of an individual share in the management of hunting... I would by all means prefer to go with one friend. In this case we would please ourselves instead of becoming mere shooting-machines acting under the instruction of the chief of a large party, who is always chosen on starting in order to secure unity of action, and who makes all the arrangements."
Maharaja of Surguja killed 1,710 tigers in his hunting quests. George Yule, a British civil servant in Bengal Presidency had killed more than 500 tigers during his administration. Sir Geoffrey Slingsby Nightingale, a colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps shot more than 300 tigers while serving in India. For the Maharaja of Rewa, shooting of 109 tigers, with the advent to guns, was considered auspicious for a prince when he was newly crowned as the King of the state. King George V on his visit to Colonial India in 1911 for his grand coronation, killed 39 tigers in a matter of 10 days Skin of one of these is on display at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum. In 1921, Duke of Windsor is known to have shot 17 tigers in one week. The Maharaja of Cooch Behar State killed 365 tigers as a sport. Col J Macdonald of Bengal Army, Revenue Survey killed 70 tigers. F.B. Simson of Bengal Civil Services, hunted around 180 tigers.
In 1924, General William Lendrum Mitchell, also known as "Father of US Air Force" was invited to colonial India as a guest of the then Viceroy, The Lord Irwin. He recounts his shooting of 2 tigers (9 feet 6 inch tigress and a 10 feet tiger) in two days and his wife killing one (a 10 feet 4 inch tiger) during a three-day Big-Game Hunting with 800 beaters in Eastern India with Maharaja of Surjuga as "The Hindu religion prohibits the taking of life of most animals, and, besides, the natives are not allowed to keep firearms; so, in spite of the dense population, animals of all kinds are comparatively secure... The jungle beasts (read: tigers) of India are very ferocious, while the inhabitants are practically unarmed and are unwilling to kill most animals on account of their religion. A fact which forcibly impresses the western travellers in India is the proximity in which the indigenous people and the animals of the fields and forest live. Wild creatures of all sorts are found at the doors of the huts... We had killed so many during our last three days that their pelts were not sufficiently dry to pack, so we had to spread them on top of the truck that was to carry our baggage south, allowing them to dry en route."
British officers often flaunted the size of their kill. Sir J.F. Yule have claimed killing tigers of "11 feet and odd inches" twice or thrice. Hon.J.R. Drummond, commissioner of Rohilkhand stated killing an 11 feet 9 inches tiger. Colonel D.G. Stewart affirmed hunting down an 11 feet 3 inch tiger. General Sir H. Green lay claim to assisting in killing of tiger in Surat that measured 11 feet 11 inch while he himself has shot a tiger of 10 feet 11 inches. Claude Clerk at Hyderabad is known to have killed a tiger measuring 11 feet 6 inches. However, Mr. C Shillongford who has hunted more than 200 tigers, declared killing a 12 feet 4 inch tiger in 1849 and another of 11 feet 4 inches in 1855. Sir Charles Reid claims hunting a 12 feet 3 inches tiger in Dehradun. Oriental Sporting Magazine of July edition in 1968 describes Mr. Henry Cave of Gondwara shooting down an 11 feet tiger. Mrs. Lawrie Johnstone stated shooting a tiger over 11 feet. Col Sleeman from Bengal Army said the trophy he possessed belonged to a tiger of size more than 12 feet which was killed in Jabalpur. Col. H. Shakespeare held that two of his trophies belonged to tigers measuring 11 feet 8 inch and 11 feet 6 inch respectively. Francis Trevelyan Buckland mentions in his book "Curiosities of Natural History" about presence of two 13 feet tigers and a 12 feet 7 inch tiger being killed by a British from 72 Highlanders. A tigress measuring 9 feet 6 inches is also mentioned. In the jungles of Midnapore, Maj. Gen. Sir W. R. Gilbert had killed a 12 feet 2.5 inch tiger in the year 1825.
"Heroic" acts of killing this "destructive foe" and "dreadful savage" thereby liberating the country from "tiger infestation" were published in journals, memoirs, newspapers and even in sports magazines of the British Empire.
Poaching.
Poachers kill tiger for its trade in body parts like skin, teeth, claws etc. which are highly sought after in the Chinese traditional medicine and also used as display objects. A tigress scent-marks her vicinity with thick, pungent, musky fluid and announces her fertility to the other males in the area who compete for her. This makes a tigress vulnerable to poaching for her body parts to be used in making aphrodisiacs which is highly prevalent in China and Thailand. Some brothels in these countries are known to sell a sweet liquor steeped in tiger penis. Poachers in India kill and smuggle tigers to supply the increasing demands in neighboring country. Poachers are known to take advantage of man-tiger conflicts and kill the endangered animal with the help of troubled locals.
Earliest available records shows that there was a high demand for tiger parts among the English people. In 1886, tiger parts were traded in European markets with its skin/fur sold for nearly £6 (equivalent to 600 pound sterling in 2022) and its claw fetched about 5 shilling (equivalent to £25 in 2022). Tigers exceeding 11 feet were of very high value.
In the 1950s, a tiger pelt was sold for $50 in India. With high exports and increasing fashion trends and demands, fur, rugs and coats made of tiger skin were sold for $10,000 in U.S. and Europe during the 1960s. Around 1,000 kg (2,200 pounds) of bones (estimated to be from 80 tigers) was seized in August 1993 at Delhi. The consignment was meant to be smuggled into China for their medicinal use.
By June 2004, it came to light that none of the tigers in Sariska Tiger Reserve survived in the protected area. However, government record showed presence of 18 tigers. This exposed the corruption and neglect in the Rajasthan Forest Department. Funds meant for conservation were siphoned off by the state government. Arrest of poachers revealed that killing the tigers in Sariska was easy job for them as the walkie-talkies of guards were non-functional and the check posts at wildlife areas manned by some 300 guards were abandoned during the monsoon season which provided easy access in and out of the tiger reserve for poaching. Security personnel with bamboo sticks or half-a-century old British era Lee-Enfield rifles often encountered poachers carrying Assault rifles and AK-47s.
Tiger skin was most sought-after for ceremonial clothing in China-controlled Tibet. However, this practice was put to an end when the Tibetan spiritual leader, Dalai Lama denounced the ceremonial clothing made of tiger and leopard skin. In 2006, reports emerged showing Chinese police officers laughing and posing with people wearing clothing made of tiger skin. These were sold in open markets of China despite the trade ban under UN convention. It was also reported that China was considering to lift the ban on bone trade from tigers raised in farms which could have negative consequences on tigers in India as there was no way to differentiate the bones from wild Indian tigers. The report showed Chinese businessmen purchasing tiger skin for home decor.
Certain communities in India are known for making fake tiger claws using the bones of livestock due to their high demand and value. 2018 survey showed high poaching cases at Amdarbad, Dampa, Dudhwa, Kanha, Melghat, Nagarhole, Palamau, Pench, Rajaji, Srisailam (NSTR) and Udanti-Sitanadi Tiger Reserves.
Human-Eaters.
On 2 November 2018, a tigress named Avni (officially known as T1, age 6 years) who had two 10-month-old cubs was shot and killed near Borati village in the Yavatmal forests after more than a month-long search operation by a controversial civilian hunter Ashgar Ali Khan, son of India's most famous hunter Nawab Shafath Ali Khan, in collaboration with Maharashtra state forest department when she was accused of being a human-eater for past year and a half, held responsible for the death of 13 locals since June 2016. This reserve forest at Yavatmal has no records of having any tiger before and is 170 km2 patch that forms a part of greater Vidarbha tiger landscape and has Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary nearby. Forensic investigation and DNA analysis linked Avni to 5 of the 13 people died in the animal attack. All efforts of finding the tigress with sniffer dogs, Thermal Imaging drones, elephant patrolling and luring the tigress with cologne scent were unsuccessful as the area had heavy growth of Lantana camara which made it easy for her to hide and take cover. Presence of one more tiger was also known in the region. Apparently, the citizens appealed to the President Ram Nath Kovind and the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to protect the tigress by running a campaign #"LetAvniLive" and several marches in cities across the nation. It is said that the killing orders were issued to clear the land from tiger occupancy so that industries could be set up in the area. Post-mortem reports suggested she was killed by single bullet wound and no attempts were made to tranquilize or capture the tigress while still being alive. The forest department personnel are equipped and trained with tranquilising guns to capture the protected animal alive but still a private hunter was brought in to kill and later rewarded.
Many violations of standard protocols were committed in this incidence. (1) The orders were issued in the name of the father but his son shot the tigress. (2) Such operations begin with sunrise and end at sunset. Tigress was killed in the Night. (3) At time of killing, wildlife veterinarian or any senior forest department official were not present with the hunting team. (4) In a statement, the team mentioned attempt to tranquilize the tigress failed and when she attacked, the person shot the tigress in self defense. How the "scheduled drug" used to sedate the tigress was handled in absence of a trained vet or wildlife expert raises doubts. (5) Spot panchanama suggests the possibility of manual piercing of dart into the skin. (6) Tigress body had no signs of resistance.
Habitat Loss.
In the past 100 years, tigers have lost almost 93% of their global historic habitat ranges in the wild. Habitat loss leads to fragmentation and isolation of existing population. Having increased agricultural areas that surround forests and other reserved areas act as an extension of natural habitats which results in tiger-human conflict, resulting in both human fatalities and retaliatory killing of tigers.
Sunderban is known for abundant tigers and its preys. The world's largest mangrove forest area is threatened by clearing of trees to meet charcoal demand and for prawn fishing in the swamps. Construction of floating hotels and floating casinos are proposed along with helipad and golf course by tourist company that will have adverse effect on the delicate ecosystem by disrupting the traditional symbiotic way of life and livelihood of people living in the region. 2018 survey showed Tiger Reserves at Achanakamar, Buxa, Dudhwa, Mukundara, Panna, Rajaji, Sanjay-Dubri, Sariska, and Udanti-Sitanadi are facing pressure due to livestock overgrazing.
Population.
Tigers have the potential to expand its population rapidly. A female tiger attains sexual maturity at the age of three and can produce litters of usually 2 or 3 but up to 6 or 7 fast growing cubs after a gestation of only three and a half months. If all the newborns in litter die, the female tiger can give birth to the next litter within five months. Juvenile mortality rate is high among the tigers with about 50% cubs not surviving till the second year. Cubs remain with their mothers up to the age of two. Male tigers become sexually active after the age of four. At the most, lifespan of a tiger may reach up to 20 years.
In the 1900s, at the beginning of the century, more than 100,000 Bengal Tigers were believed to have roamed all over the country. While some estimates put the number to a more conservative figure of 80,000. Artists in Taxidermy, Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen of Mysore accounts to having stuffed more than 25,000 tigers in first 50 years of their business. More than 50,000 tigers were estimated in 1930. From the 1930s onwards, factory records reveal that Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen would process over 400 Tigers per year till the 1960s. At the time of Independence from British Rule, India had estimated around 40,000 tigers in the year 1947. The first country-wide tiger census in 1972 put the numbers to 1,827 tigers. Implementation of Project Tiger saw the tiger population to rise up to 3,500 in the 1990s. For the year 2018–19, estimation was 2,967 tigers in the wild with over half of the population found in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka put together.
India saw a 44% surge in tiger deaths in the 10 years 2011–21 with 1059 deaths in the time period. Madhya Pradesh recorded the highest number of deaths in these ten years, followed by Maharshtra and Karnataka. The number of deaths have increased from 88 in 2012 to 127 in 2021.
Tiger Signs.
Presence of the tiger can be confirmed by observing the following seven signs
Tiger Census.
After the Sariska incident in 2004–05, where all the tigers were lost due to poaching but the official records showed presence of tiger population based on the pugmark census, Tiger Task Force (TTF) was constituted which recommended changes in the population assessment method. With several methodologies available for conducting tiger census and lack of uniform data collection methodology and information on survey often results in difficulty to make comparisons or draw inferences from such data. It demands for a good scientific design in implementing an effective monitoring scheme for tigers and their habitats. The forest department has been making use of Camera Traps, GPS, Pedometers and other modern equipment in the tiger population studies.
The 2018–19 assessment (fourth cycle) done in 20 states covering 381,400 km2 area which was divided in 317,958 habitat plots with an investment of 620,795 man-days is considered to be the world's largest wildlife survey ever undertaken that put the nationwide population estimate at 2,967 tigers (SE range 2,603 to 3,346). 65% of total tiger population (1,923) were found inside the Tiger Reserves. The exercise of tiger census is done once every four years. From the fifth cycle of population estimation, during 2022, India is making use of digital means in the form of M-STrIPES application.
Population estimates in India since implementation of the new assessment methodology is 
M-STrIPES.
Monitoring System for Tigers: Intensive Protection and Ecological Status (M-STrIPES) is a digital platform used by the forest frontline staff which facilitates patrolling, assesses ecological status and aids in mitigating human-wildlife
conflict in and around tiger reserves effectively. The M-STrIPES program uses GPS, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and remote sensing, to collect information from the field and creates a database using modern Information Technology (IT) based tools. Later, the collected data is used to analyze the information using GIS and statistical tools to provide inferences that allow tiger reserve managers to improve their wildlife managerial protocols.
Camera Traps.
Camera traps are photographic devices equipped with motion sensors which captures the image or video when any animal passes nearby. The Guinness World Records recognized the country's efforts as the world's largest camera trap survey of wildlife in 2018–19. Across 141 different sites and in 26,838 locations, these camera traps were set up to survey an area of 121,337 square kilometers capturing 34,858,623 photographs of wildlife in which 76,651 were tigers. These images were then fed to a stripe-pattern-recognition software which identified 2,461 individual tigers (excluding cubs).
TX2.
TX2 (Tiger times 2) goal is the global commitment driven by World Wide Fund for Nature (formerly World Wildlife Fund, WWF) and undertaken by 13 range governments at the St Petersburg Tiger Summit (2010) to double the global tiger population in the wild by 2022 by giving priority, effort, innovation and investment for the recovery of tiger population. India achieved this TX2 feat in 2018, four years ahead of the set target. In order to bring the countries together for prioritizing tiger conservation and management globally, Global Tiger Day celebration was announced on 29 July at St Petersburg Tiger Summit 2010.
Polymorphism.
Sometimes a tiger with fur colour other than classical orange is recorded in India. These can be Black tiger, Golden tiger or White tiger variants. This polymorphism is due to genetic reasons. 2018 survey found pictures captured in camera-traps of a golden tiger in Kaziranga Tiger Reserve and a black phenotype in Similipal Tiger Reserve.
Conservation.
As an apex predator, tigers are indicators of a healthy ecosystem. Conservation of tigers ensure the sustenance of healthy populations of herbivores and other carnivores. Survival of tigers in the wild is dependent on the conservation and management efforts. On 1 April 1973, Government of India launched Project Tiger "to ensure maintenance of a viable population of Tigers in India for scientific, economic, aesthetic, cultural and ecological values, and to preserve for all times, areas of biological importance as a national heritage for the benefit, education and enjoyment of the people." Implementation of this conservation project over the years has highlighted the need for statutory institutional mechanism with administrative powers and legal backing which resulted in creation of National Tiger Conservation Authority(NTCA) on 4 September 2006. Highest degree of protection to tiger is provided under this law. Committed goal-oriented efforts and investment in tiger conservation have produced desirable results.
India has signed bilateral agreements China, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and Russia to address issues of mutual concern for Tiger conservation.
To deal with reintroduction and supplementation in the areas that were once known for presence of tigers but presently have none or reduced tiger density, NTCA in 2022, released SOP titled, Tiger Reintroduction and Supplementation in Wild Protocol which has taken into account the scientific knowledge on the topic and conditions that are typical to India in order to effectively achieve the objective.
Securing Habitat.
Protected Areas (PA) were set up in India that served as refuge for the wild animals who were threatened by habitat loss due to anthropological pressures. Some of these protected areas were later identified as reserves. Tigers require vast region of undisturbed terrain with sufficient prey numbers so that they can repopulate and maintain the stable demographic and genetic continuance. In 1973, nine tiger reserves were declared as protected under law with cumulative area of approximately 18,278 km2. By 2018, it was expanded to fifty tiger reserves with nearly 72,749 km2. of protected area which formed about 2.21% of India's total geographical area.
As of July 2022, India has created 52 tiger reserves. These tiger reserves have played important role in the success of Project Tiger since its inception. Preventing habitat fragmentation and effectively managing the area under conversation benefits the wildlife.
According to 2018 survey, tiger occupancy was found to be stable at an area 88,985 km2 across the country since 2014 estimate (88,558 km2).
Tiger Reserves.
A "tiger reserve" is legally mandated to designate a critical "core area" wherein human interference is strictly prohibited. A "buffer zone" surrounds the core-area, wherein conservation intent is to be prioritized over other land uses. Breeding populations of tigers are extensively in the core area of tiger reserves. The size of these tiger reserves in India vary between 344 km2. to 3,150 km2. with an average area of average 1,321 km2.
2018 assessment shows Corbett Tiger Reserve with the largest population of about 231 tigers. Tiger Reserves at Bandhavgarh, Bandipur, Nagarhole, Mudumalai and Kaziranga each had over a hundred tigers while Dudhwa, Kanha, Tadoba, Sathyamangalam and Sundarbans Tiger Reserves had over 80 tigers each. Buxa and Dampa Tiger Reserves showed absence of population as these places are historically known for their poor tiger status. Deficiency in tiger numbers was seen at Indravati, Udanti-Sitanadi and Achanakmar Tiger Reserves owing to unsatisfactory law and order situation. Tiger numbers at other places like Amrabad, Anshi Dandeli, Buxa, Dampa, Kawal, Manas, Nagarjunsagar Sri Sailam, Nameri, Pakke, Palamau, Sanjay-Dubri and Similipal Tiger Reserves are below their potential. Targeted management with enhanced resources can yield positive results.
Core, Buffer and Corridor.
Tiger conservation follows the principle of "core-buffer-corridor". Core area is highly protected while buffer zones are in the periphery of the core area. Buffer area is meant for multiple use with community participation for supporting tiger conservation. Corridors are the areas between the larger reserved forests which serves as the connecting geographical section of habitat that enables wildlife to move freely through the landscape. However, many of these corridors are not designated as protected areas and are prone to degradation due unsustainable human activities and developmental projects undertaken in these eco-sensitive areas. NTCA has prioritized the protection, conservation and development of corridors at the national level due to its significance in ensuring tiger population growth. These corridors would ensure genetic exchange through dispersal. The corridors would also serve to guard against extinction risks caused by environmental and man-made factors. Nature Conservation Foundation under the grant of Project Tiger is working on the conservation of corridors in Cauvery-MM Hills-BR Hills landscape.
Funds from Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) are being utilized for promoting voluntary village resettlement from core areas of the Tiger Reserves.
Conservation Assured Tiger Standards (CA|TS).
In 2020, the NTCA and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of India have announced the adoption of the Conservation Assured Tiger Standards (CA|TS) to all the tiger reserves covering over 7000 km2. land area which sets minimum standards to manage tiger species, and encourages assessments to benchmark progress. As of July 2021, 14 Tiger Reserves in India - Manas, Kaziranga, Orang, Satpura, Pench, Kanha, Panna, Valmiki, Dudhwa, Parambikulam, Mudumalai, Bandipur, Anamalai and Sundarbans - have been awarded with international CA|TS accreditation. Efforts are on to bring in more Tiger Reserves under CA|TS accreditation.
Anti-Poaching Activities.
The tiger is also protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Use of technology to improve patrolling and monitoring the tiger reserves reduces the poaching incidents. Better equipping the rangers of the forest decreases the threat of poaching and ensures the area is a safe haven for tigers and other wildlife moving through it.
Forest officials on efficient vigil with M-STrIPES implementation, use of wireless communication devices, suitable gears and weapons for patrolling guards is important to boost the morale and increase the show of strength in vulnerable Protected Areas.
Reducing Tiger-Human Conflict.
While increase in the population leads tiger often breaching the formal protected areas of forests and roam outside the reserve perimeter to establish a new territory, the natural habitat destruction results in the decline of prey numbers hence the tiger looks for its food in human settlements. Both leads to increase in events of Tiger-Human conflicts. Research Institutes like Wildlife Institute of India are playing key role in studying and aiding government initiatives to bring down the number of such untoward instances.
India is working on a plan to use LIDAR based survey technology to reduce the incidence of conflict.
Sustainable Livelihood Development.
Maharashtra Forest Department has effectively managed to reduce the tiger-human conflict with the help of NGOs and grassroots organisations in providing the alternate source of energy and livelihood thereby reducing the dependence of local people on the forest resources and ensuring maintenance of forest cover for the long term survival of 200 odd tigers in their territory. Both conservation and development can happen in a mutually complementary manner. India needs to prosper both economically and environmentally. Implementation of community-based ecotourism model provides livelihood opportunities to the locals around the Tiger Reserves.
Raising Awareness.
Civil society organisations and NGOs often work with local population to motivate them to support the conservation efforts. Local youth often support the forest staff in patrolling and wildlife monitoring.
World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) and Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) are some of the organizations working actively in the Indian tiger conservation forefront.

Bones (The Killers song)

"Bones" is a song by American rock band the Killers, written by lead singer Brandon Flowers, bassist Mark Stoermer and drummer Ronnie Vannucci. It is the eighth track on their second album "Sam's Town", released in October 2006. It was originally titled "It's Only Natural" in its early stages. Eventually, the song was released as the second single from "Sam's Town" in late November 2006.
The single did not match the success of its predecessor and new center-piece track, "When You Were Young", only registering on "Billboard"'s Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States at number 21. The single peaked at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart. The music video for the song is the first directed by filmmaker Tim Burton, who would again collaborate with the band on their video for the 2012 single "Here with Me". The cover features a Desert bighorn sheep, the state mammal of Nevada, where the Killers are from.
Music video.
The music video for "Bones" marks the music-video-directing debut of film director Tim Burton. Clips of the band were shot Aug. 17–18, 2006, and were edited together along with CGI backgrounds and characters, including a (fitting) Burton staple: skeletons. Michael Steger and Devon Aoki star in the video.
Scenes from the films "Lolita", "Creature from the Black Lagoon", and "Jason and the Argonauts", more specifically the scenes with Ray Harryhausen's skeleton-men, are shown behind the band. There is a sequence where Flowers' hand is replaced with that of a skeleton. The beach scenes from "From Here to Eternity" and "10" are recreated with skeleton figures. The leading couple are seen driving onto the beach where the girl removes her hair to reveal her skull and the man pulls off his shirt to reveal his skeleton. The two leading skeletons are later seen running across the beach to embrace, only for them to crash into one another and shatter to pieces. Then, on the beach, a wave comes over to reveal the two skeletons kissing. At the end of the video, the entire band are skeletons, and they all fall apart at the song's final note.
The drive-in depicted unofficially is that of the West Wind Las Vegas Drive-In Theatre located in North Las Vegas, NV. The clothing worn by the band in the video was preserved in an exhibit at the Las Vegas Hard Rock Hotel and Casino's entrance cafe before the cafe was demolished in late 2019. At the 2007 Shockwaves NME Awards, it won the award for best video.

The Freddie Mercury Album is a posthumous solo project with material from Queen frontman and vocalist Freddie Mercury released in 1992, to observe the anniversary of his death. The album is mainly made up of new remixes, as well as the original versions of "Barcelona", "Love Kills", "Exercises in Free Love", and "The Great Pretender". A week later, The Great Pretender, its US counterpart, was released.
There were numerous producers who had permission from Jim Beach to use the original master tapes. Reinhold Mack, who is not credited as being involved, was hired to oversee the project. The album was released by Hollywood Records on 24 November 1992. 
The US album differs from its UK counterpart (aside from a different running order) by replacing the original versions of "The Great Pretender" and "Love Kills" with remixes, featuring a slightly altered ending of the "Mr. Bad Guy" remix, and replacing "Barcelona" with a remix of "My Love Is Dangerous".

BK Chicken Fries

BK Chicken Fries are a fried chicken product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. At the time of their introduction in 2005, the company had intended Chicken Fries to be one of their larger, adult-oriented products made with higher-quality ingredients than their standard menu items. Additionally, the product further targeted the snacking and convenience food markets with a specific packaging design that was intended to be easier to handle and fit into automotive cup holders. The product was part of a series of product introductions designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old males. Along with this series of larger, more complex menu products, the company intended to attract a larger, more affluent adult audience who would be willing to spend more on the better-quality products. They were discontinued in the United States in 2012, but continued to be sold in some markets, such as Italy. In August 2014, they were reintroduced for a limited-time offering (LTO) in North America, leading to their permanent re-addition to the menu in March 2015 in over 30 countries globally.
As one of the company's major offerings, the chicken fries are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the nu metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on a new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product has been a prominent part of the menu for the better part of a decade, Burger King has released very few LTO variants of the product, with the first one being released in the summer of 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.
History.
BK Chicken Fries were introduced in 2005 as part of a menu expansion that was designed to cater to a more adult demographic looking for dishes that went beyond the standard fast food fare. At the time of the introduction, Burger King was targeting a demographic group it identified as the "super fan", a group consisting of males between the ages of 18 and 34 that ate at fast food restaurants several times a week. Additionally, the chain was also adding other fare such as its TenderGrill, TenderCrisp and Angus sandwiches, that were designed to offer more complex menu items that would raise average check prices and expand the breadth of its offerings in the fast food market place. The product was discontinued in January 2012, replaced with Burger King's version of chicken strips in March of that year.
Following Chicken Fries' discontinuation, there was a call for the product's reinstatement from fans of the product on forums such as Reddit; Business Insider noted that they are one of the 17 most requested fast products that people would like to see returned to menus. Fans of the product also established several social media accounts dedicated to Chicken Fries' return on Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. Additionally, a Change.org petition was created that called on Burger King to reinstate the product to its menu. Perez Hilton's web site declared that Chicken Fries are one product of many that will never come back, while comedian Daniel Tosh featured a skit during one of the segments of his show, Tosh.0, to the product's return. They were re-released in August 2014 as a limited time offering (LTO). The return of the product met with a favorable reaction from those who were advocating for Chicken Fries to return to the Burger King menu. There was disappointment from these groups as well because of the product's status as a limited time offering. In March 2015, Burger King permanently re-added Chicken Fries to the menu in a large, international menu expansion in thirty countries.
The product received large amounts of attention on the internet after its discontinuation; at its peak the product was being mentioned in one form or another on average once every 40 seconds. In its third-quarter 2014 earnings report, Burger King admitted that the massive social media attention was one of the primary reasons it brought the product back. The positive reaction to the reintroduction included over one million mentions on Twitter. This tied into a major push by the company to utilize social media as a free marketing tool to millennials, who overwhelmingly utilize interactive media to communicate and prefer companies that utilize these tools.
Besides customer demand for the product, another major reason for the reintroduction was due to a significant rise in the cost of beef. During the previous few months leading up to the reintroduction of Chicken Fries, the available cattle stocks had declined since the USDA began record keeping in 1973. This shortage of ground beef caused a spike in the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains in the fast food industry drove Burger King to boost sales by introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus with products such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's and sandwiches based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.
The third reason the product was brought back was because of a new approach the company was taking regarding LTO products; instead of putting out large numbers of products that may only appeal to a small audience, it instead would only add a smaller number of products that have broader market appeal. Chicken Fries were part of that goal, with the re-introduction utilizing a three prong approach: its stated intention to introduce products to those that will have most impact, a bid to appeal to Millennials utilizing social media focused campaigns, and to utilize a former product from its portfolio that the company probably should have thought about before discontinuing. The idea of reintroducing older products is appealing to companies such as Burger King and McDonald's because it is operationally easier than launching a completely new product by allowing a company to utilize older advertising along with its existing supply chain already which is already established to deliver the product ingredients. The limited-time offers allow chains to bring "new" product the menu without adding permanent complexity to their kitchen operations.
The reintroduction of Chicken Fries proved to be a fortuitous decision for Burger King, the resulting sales bump provided an increase in profits each time they were added to the menu. The 2014 reintroduction was a resounding success for the company, helping Burger King achieve domestic same-store comparable sales rise of 3.1% in 2014. On the opposite side, McDonald's reported a 4% decrease for the same period in its domestic same-store sales, which the competitor attributed to "ongoing aggressive competitive activity." The success of the 2015 reintroduction again helped the chain post positive financial numbers, with the company reporting that the Chicken Fries reintroduction was one of a trio of factors that helped drive second quarter 2015 same-store comparable sales growth up by 7.9%. Again, arch rival McDonald's reported that its same-store comparable sales fell 2% for the same time period in the US as its promotions failed to meet financial analysts' predictions.
Product description.
BK Chicken Fries are breaded and fried chicken strips, and were available in three sizes during their initial availability period: six-, nine-, and twelve-piece servings. Three and thirty-six-piece sizes were available as limited time offers (LTO). The smaller size was sold à la carte, while larger portion could be purchased as a meal option. While its core audience was adults such as soccer moms or commuters, a kids' meal option was at one time available in the U.S. that included a six-piece order of the product. The 2014 reissued product was only available in a nine-piece serving, at a recommended price point of USD $2.89.
A summer 2015 LTO introduced a spicy variant, called Fiery Chicken Fries, in addition to the standard offering; the product featured a spicy breading featuring a mix of cayenne pepper, black pepper and other spices that replaced the normal coating. The product was the first variant of BK Chicken Fries added to the company's menu. In developing the product, Burger King's chief marketing officer stated that once taste testers described the product as "spicy as shit", the company realized it had the correct spice mix. Sale of the product would be limited to a one-month period, but the company stated if sales were successful enough it would consider extending the availability beyond the initial time frame.
To accompany the 2015 re-introduction of the product, the chain released a new sauce simply called Chicken Fry Sauce. The new condiment was not widely advertised, with almost all promotion being done through the company's social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook. The sauce is described as a combination of BBQ sauce and honey mustard, and described by Burger King as "the sauce of all sauces." The company's posts were accompanied by the hashtag AskForTheSauce.
Packaging.
Part of the product's format was in its packaging, which was designed to fit in a car cup holder. The BK Chicken Fry box, while square in shape, will sit comfortably in the cup holder and its top, when opened, forms a small tray that is designed to hold dipping sauce. Burger King credits the design of this box with helping to make its Chicken Fries the most popular adult-oriented chicken product in the United States at the time. Since most of the fast food industry's business is take-out or drive-thru traffic, this allowed the convenience food purchaser to drive and eat with little effort. With the introduction of the BK Chicken Fries, BK began adapting some of its other product packaging so that it could also be placed in an automotive cup holder. In addition to the Chicken Fries container, the company added a trademarked and patented, round French fry container which it calls the "FryPod", which is a paper cup made from 50 percent recycled materials that is also designed to fit in an automotive cup holder. The package design won an honorable mention at a packaging industry design competition hosted by the Quick Service Restaurant division of the Foodservice and Packaging Institute in 2007.
The 2015 Fiery Chicken Fries promotion introduced a packaging variant that featured new graphics. The image featured on the box is an angry looking chicken in a Lucha libre-style mask. Other packaging variants that have appeared over the years have included tie-ins to the NFL and SpongeBob SquarePants.
Advertising.
Coq Roq.
Coq Roq, also spelled COQ ROQ, was an advertising program created in late 2004 for Burger King by the Miami-based advertising firm Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B). Coq Roq was a fictional "rooster metal" group (albeit composed of various real-life musicians) with its own website and associated content. The band's musical "style" was classified as punk-sounding rock n' roll, thrash or nu metal. The campaign featured a viral marketing website, television and print campaigns and a fictional MySpace page. The program was similar to other marketing campaigns created by CP+B for Burger King, including the Subservient Chicken, Ugoff, and Sith Sense.
According to CP+B employee Tom Zukoszki, the fictional background information for the band was that they signed with Burger King instead of a major record label. As part of the promotion, a four-song LP record was recorded, two music videos produced, and a national (US) tour planned. The tour had to be cancelled because the actor playing the lead singer, a Canadian citizen, was unable to enter the United States because he had a criminal record in his home country.
2014 reintroduction.
The 2014 reintroduction of the product featured a first for the company, a primarily digital-focused promotion headed by the company's online media agency Code and Theory. To start off the promotion, the company announced the forthcoming reintroduction a few weeks before the product was set to be released with the simple tweet "You asked. We answered. ChickenFriesAreBack." The company also expanded its social media footprint specifically for the Chicken Fries promotion, adding new Tumblr and Snapchat accounts to their stable of social media outlets. The idea behind the large social media push was monetary, instead of spending capital on a traditional multi-week, multi-media advertising campaign the company would have product-loyalists spread the word at a fraction of the cost of traditional advertising.
Instead of producing a new series of spots on the television front, the chain reused the commercials originally produced by Crispin, Porter + Bogusky from the initial product run. These commercials were only played on Thursdays, specifically for the social media meme known as Throwback Thursday, events that feature historical personal stories or happenings that are routinely run on various sites such as Facebook or Instagram. The only major change to the advertisements was the addition of the hashtag TBT to the lower left-hand corner of the video.
After the end of the promotional period, Burger King received numerous complaints from fans of Chicken Fries through social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. One of the major ways the company responded was through personalized responses to these posts. Instead of using an automated response that would paste a standardized message on people's Twitter feeds, the company instead employed several staff to personally respond to customers voicing displeasure on the LTO nature of the 2014 introduction. The entire 2014 Chicken Fries promotion represented a major shift in the attitude towards advertising for Burger King, moving from a more traditional advertising structure to one focused almost entirely on digitally based media. This change happened fairly quickly, falling into place over the twelve to eighteen-month period preceding the reintroduction of Chicken Fries to the chain's menu. Along with the new advertising firm, a new director of digital marketing and social media was newly hired from cosmetics firm L'Oréal was added, increasing the clout of the digital advertising team within the chain.
2015 reintroduction.
Advertising for the permanent reintroduction of Chicken Fries in early 2015 was again shaped around a large digital-media push headed by its new advertising firm David. However, unlike the 2014 promotion that was almost exclusively digitally oriented, the 2015 promotion was accompanied with a sizable television and media tie-in to the annual NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament. In the host city of Indianapolis, Burger King sponsored Chicken Fries-branded SUVs that would give free rides to visitors. A series of advertisements for the product and the company's 2 for $5 sandwich promotion ran during the tournament featuring the hash tag WatchLikeaKing, along with a series of NCAA co-branded kid's meals.
On the digital front, the company utilized a viral marketing strategy starring a chicken named Gloria. Gloria would be brought to local restaurants to decide if the particular location would sell Chicken Fries that day; she would be given two feed bowls labeled "yes" and "no" and depending on which bowl she ate from would decide if the product would be sold there that day. Gloria the chicken had her own truck with her own custom-designed coop. There was a social media presence accompanying the tour with the hashtags RandomGloria and ChickenFries. Additionally, each of the events were live streamed on the product's webpage, which also included other things such as Gloria's biography, a map of upcoming events and links to corporate web sites. The Gloria tour did raise the ire of animal rights organization PETA. The group initially responded to the promotion with a one-word tweet, "DESPICABLE," with the follow-up "@BurgerKing forcing a chicken to decide if her friends will become #ChickenFries." PETA stated that the concept behind the tour made their jaws drop over perceived cruelty.
Controversies.
Sexual innuendo.
The CP+B produced Coq Roq advertisements followed a pattern of controversy for the company, as previous advertisements produced by CP+B had come under fire for perceived or overt sexual innuendo. An earlier example of this type of advertisement was a promotion for a LTO version of Burger King's TenderCrisp sandwich which featured Darius Rucker in a commercial singing a variant of Burger King's "Have It Your Way" jingle that featured a line about "a train of ladies with a nice caboose," where caboose was not referring to the last car of a train, but the buttocks of the actresses featured in the commercial. The issues raised by public interest groups in this instance came from complaints over the double entendres and sexual innuendo on the Coq Roq website. Pictures of scantily clad women posing as groupies of the band were featured in one section of the site and sported comments such as "groupies love the Coq" and "Groupies love Coq". Protests from the public over the sexual innuendo of the comments forced BK to request CB+P to have content be changed to something more appropriate for a family oriented restaurant.
Slipknot lawsuit.
In August 2005, CP+B and Burger King became the target of lawyers of the band Slipknot, who alleged the mask-wearing rooster rockers were a blatant copy of the band's style. The band claimed that CP+B had approached Slipknot's record company, Roadrunner Records, with an offer to appear in another commercial for Burger King. The band declined on the grounds that they did not want to be associated with a burger chain and they felt that the Coq Roq advertisements were deliberately co-opting the band's signature look and style in order to influence its fans to purchase the chain's products. The band issued a cease and desist letter to CP+B and BK requesting the advertisements be pulled. When the two parties declined, the band sued for an undisclosed amount.
CP+B and Burger King then filed counter-suit against Slipknot, stating that the Coq Roq band was fictitious, visually and musically bore little resemblance to Slipknot's style, and at best was a general parody of heavy metal bands that wear masks or try to achieve a mask-like effect, such as Mushroomhead, KISS or GWAR. Partly mentioned in the counter-suit included the notion that Slipknot were parodies of bands themselves, further citing the specific example of Mushroomhead, who wore near identical style masks and jumpsuits, and had been playing several years before Slipknot even formed, let alone went mainstream. Both suits were eventually dropped, and Burger King ended the campaign shortly after.
Tie-ins.
As a product tie-in with the 2005–2006 NFL season, Burger King introduced a 36 piece party pack as a limited time offer. This promotion was more general and featured the BK mascot, the Burger King, digitally superimposed into NFL game footage so appeared to be involved in the game. Some of the players the King replaced include Steve Young, Deion Sanders, and Moe Williams. He has also been depicted performing the Lambeau Leap and dumping Gatorade on the head of former Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula. The primary packaging was altered to include the NFL logo; the party pack designed to mimic the texture of a football, included the NFL logo and a humorous comment along the line of those found on BK packaging at the time.
During the summer of 2006, BK introduced the 12 piece size as a product tie-in with NASCAR and its new sponsorship of a NASCAR team. The promotion was part of the company's new sponsorship deal with NASCAR and the new BK/Michael Waltrip Racing team featuring Waltrip's 00 car number. Several television ads were produced featuring BK Chicken Fries and Waltrip's racing team with a fictional pit crew member, the chicken server.
During 2007, Burger King had another product tie-in with a Nickelodeon show, "SpongeBob SquarePants". Again the box was altered, this time so the design of the box looked like the character SpongeBob. Later in-store promotions in the U.S. have urged customers to add a six-piece portion to their meal as a snack option.
Naming and trademarks.
The name "BK Chicken Fries" is not registered as a trademark in the markets where the product is sold (US, Canada, the UK, and Europe);[Notes 1] however, the initialism "BK" is a trademark of Burger King Holdings and is displayed with the ® symbol in the United States, Europe and New Zealand.[Notes 2] The term "chicken fries" has been trademarked in the United States several times, but never by Burger King. In Canada, "chicken fries" was owned by KFC parent Yum! Brands, but its registration was expunged from the records.[Notes 3]

Route setter

A route setter is a person who designs artificial rock climbing wall routes, or problems. Also known as "setters", these professionals combine technical craft with an artistic representation of real rock climbing moves. They do this with modular resin, polyurethane, polyester, fiberglass, or wood holds or "grips" that mimic real rock features. Route setters create new challenges for indoor climbing walls, and also for competition climbing routes.
Description.
A "setter" can set routes in many ways, some examples being bouldering, top roping, lead climbing, among other types of climbing. Someone wishing to get training as a route setter can simply take a short workshop in a specific climbing gym and learn the basics in order to set in that particular gym. The limitation is that their skills will only be recognized by that climbing gym only. If they want to route set elsewhere, however, the person may register to a route-setter certification workshop where, depending on the applicant's abilities, one of five grades of route setting can be attained. Usually, the more complex routes the applicant can make, the higher the level of certification.
The simplest ways on how to set an indoor route are to decide by placement, rocks, and/or themes. Setters tend to stay away from miscellaneous rocks placed randomly on a wall that are not one of the previously mentioned categories. This is because they are difficult to climb, not very enjoyable and are aesthetically unpleasing. Placement is where there is a specific part of the artificial wall the setter wants to work on. This wall could have ‘natural’ features or arêtes that the setter wants to be used when someone works on this route. When the setter chooses by rocks, they might have a specific boulder or boulders that they want to base the route on. Occasionally these specific boulders are the crux of the route. Lastly, the setter can base a bouldering route on theme. A themed boulder route is when the setter uses only boulders of one type such as crimp, sloper, jugs, pocket, etc. The setter can also base the theme on one specific coloring or a brand or anything else that can be common among all boulders the setter chooses. When the setter plans a route make sure that it is in their skill level otherwise they cannot test their own route and possibly not be able to finish setting it. In addition, the route setter must make sure to communicate with the gym manager because they will often need more routes of a specific difficulty or type. Route setting can be done solo or in groups of route setters. The advantage of having more setters is that each setter will climb differently, can be used to test the route, have different arm spans, different strengths and weaknesses with climbing. The problem about having more people is there can be a clash of ideas and efficiency can go down because of this.
 To mount the boulder into the artificial wall the setter will simply have to screw it in with a screwdriver. Securing boulders is easy because the walls are built with holes strategically placed for common boulders to be placed. Boulders have different type of screws based on which type of boulder the company was made by. A setter must be sure to use the proper according screw and screwdriver, otherwise a boulder may not be stable on the wall. Boulders can eventually be pulled off the wall over many uses, and this can result in injury or death. A ladder might be required if the setter cannot reach the next desired place to screw in the boulder. The setter must mark off the area around the route that they are setting at because there might be loose boulders that can falls on people passing by, or a climber does not accidentally climb into or around the incomplete area and possibly get hurt.
 When a setter sets routes for rock climbing, they can also use boulders that are already pre-existing on the wall for their route and not necessarily have to put new ones up. At the start of the route setting, they can either set routes by selecting boulder by boulder or by taping up places where they want each boulder to be placed. Boulder by boulder is typically easier to start setting routes with. After each boulder placement, the setter will want to test the route. This will show if they will need to make any adjustments to any boulders. Possible adjustments could be to rotate the boulder(s) so they are easier/harder to climb and help the continuity of the route. Also, the boulder(s) could be out of reach for climbers or too easy to reach in which the setter would add a smaller foothold for the shorter people or move the boulder, so the route is not as easy respectively.
 After the route is complete, the route setter will have to grade to according to the grading standard system that the climbing gym they are setting in uses. Bouldering typically uses the Hueco system from V0, V1, V2... V16 or the Fontainebleau grading system. Top-roping typically uses the French numerical system or the Yosemite Decimal System (YDS). Once the setter decides the grade, they will tape up the route to show which boulders are allowed to climb when climbing their route. A setter will not have to tape the boulders if they have already taped them up before picking boulders. Typically, the start and finish of the route is marked with two pieces of tape. There can also be squares, crosses or any other shape to keep the beginning and end distinct. After taping the route and writing down the grade and possibly a name of the route, the route will need to be climbed again to double-check if the tape can be seen from each step of the route.
 After everything is complete, it is best to get another climber or climbers to test the setter’s route to see if the other climbers agree with the setter’s marked grade. The climber(s) should be able to climb the difficulty of the marked route before asking them to test it. There will always be climbers who climb the route differently from how the setter has planned to climb it when they set it. This is not wrong, and the setter should not be bias or judge the climber for it. After a few climbers test it, the setter may want to modify the route. Routes are never permanent and always receive changes. Exception is if the route is made for a competition, then it will not be altered until the competition is over. Routes will be removed whenever the climbing gym staff decides to change routes or add more routers or strip the wall and clean it for climbing competitions. At a climbing competition there will be designed route settings who will set from all grade levels and these new routes will typically stay up for a while.
 When a setter is creating routes for top-roping or lead-climbing, it is very similar, except that they will have more vertical space to build on versus horizontal space unlike bouldering. They will need a ladder and/or self-belaying device. When the setter is self-belaying, they can attach a bucket or two onto their harness for stripping then wall of old boulders and/or adding new boulders onto the wall. Route setting for top-roping/lead-climbing can follow the similar techniques listed above, except it is more common to add tape before boulder in this case.

Igor Vishnevetsky

Igor Georgievich Vishnevetsky (; born 5 January 1964) is a Russian-born poet, novelist, screenwriter, and editor. He has been a contributor and editor in numerous literary journals, anthologies, and scholarly periodicals since the 1980s. Some of his work has been published in English, including a translated version of his first novel, "Leningrad" (2010).
Biography.
Igor Vishnevetsky was born in Rostov-on-Don in 1964 to Georgiy and Alla Vishnevetsky. Vishnevetsky originally aspired to become a composer. He studied piano performance in school and audited music theory courses at Rostov State Rachmaninoff Conservatory before attending Moscow State University to pursue a degree in philology. After graduating in 1986, Vishnevetsky became an active member of the poetry and art scenes in Moscow and St. Petersburg prior to the break-up of the Soviet Union.
Vishnevetsky emigrated to the United States in 1992. Since that time his creative work has been done chiefly in North America.
In 1996 Vishnevetsky received a Ph.D. in Russian Literature from the Department of Slavic Languages of Brown University. Subsequently, he taught at Emory University for five years. In the 2000s, he has also become a notable music historian, and is considered an authority on Sergei Prokofiev and the Russian-American composer Vladimir Dukelsky.
Vishnevetsky also was a visiting professor of Russian and Film at Carnegie Mellon University. During this time, he wrote his experimental novel "Leningrad" which describes the dehumanizing effects of the Finno-German siege of the city during World War II and deals with transformation of former Russian capital into a Soviet city. Praised for its insights into the minds of the people who experienced the collapse of everything associated with humanity, "Leningrad" won a 2010 award for the best fiction published in Russia's leading literary periodical "Novyi mir". In 2012 it won a prestigious "New Verbal Art (Novaya Slovesnost', or NoS)" literary award.
Since 2010 Vishnevetsky had been working on a film version of "Leningrad". The film was completed in 2014 (a slightly shorter version in 2015) and received a number of awards. Film historian and critic Andrei Plakhov called it "an absolutely amazing experiment,", while film critic Evgeny Maisel considered Visnevetsky's film "a true challenge to contemporary professional film production." Since 2018 he teaches English and Russian literature at the Franciscan University of Steubenville.
Vishnevetsky is an Eastern Orthodox Christian. His son is film critic Ignatiy Vishnevetsky.

Football at the 1948 Summer Olympics

The football tournament of the 1948 Summer Olympics was won by Sweden. This remains Sweden's only international title at a senior male football level and was the first international appearance of the trio that would later be known as Gre-No-Li dominating the Italian league at A.C. Milan in the 1950s.
It was the first international football tournament ever to be broadcast on television, with the semi-finals, final and bronze medal play-off all being broadcast live in full on the BBC Television Service.
Final tournament.
The tournament began on 26 July 1948 with a preliminary round of two matches: Luxembourg defeating Afghanistan 6–0 and the Netherlands beating Ireland 3–1, with Faas Wilkes scoring two goals for the Dutch. In the first round, which began five days later, the Netherlands played Great Britain at Highbury, Britain prevailing 4–3 after extra time. In goal for Britain was Ronnie Simpson, who would go on to become the oldest Scottish international debutant in history and one of the Lisbon Lions. Yugoslavia (victors over Luxembourg) and Sweden (3–0 winners against Austria) also went through. France eliminated India.
Sweden's style of play at White Hart Lane attracted much attention. Their forward line contained three exceptional players; one of them Gunnar Gren scored a brace in an easy win. There were two goals, as well, for future FIFA World Cup star Željko Čajkovski in Yugoslavia's 6–1 rout of Luxembourg, although they were behind at half-time. South Korea beat Mexico 5–3. Walter Bahr, Ed Souza, Charlie Colombo and John Souza were part of the United States team that lost 9–0 to Italy, conceding five goals at the end of the match when they were down to nine men. They would later participate in the 1950 FIFA World Cup and beat the favourites England in one of the greatest upsets in football history.
In the quarter-finals, Sweden defeated both the South Koreans and the Danes in the semi-final. In the second semi-final, Great Britain played Yugoslavia at Wembley Stadium, going out by three goals to one. 3–1 was also the score in the final in favour of Sweden over Yugoslavia.

Desfontainia

Desfontainia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Columelliaceae, though it was placed formerly in Loganiaceae, Potaliaceae (later subsumed in Gentianaceae), or a family of its own, Desfontainiaceae.
The genus was named for the French botanist, René Louiche Desfontaines.
It is hardy to , and requires winter protection in areas with significant frosts.
Species.
Species in the genus include:
The best known species, "D. spinosa" ('Chilean holly'), is a native of rainforests and mountain slopes in southern Central America and South America, occurring from Costa Rica in the north to certain islands of Tierra del Fuego (shared by Chile and Argentina) in the extreme South, being present also in Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador.
Uses include medicinal / hallucinogenic purposes, a natural dye and as an ornamental evergreen shrub. In cultivation, it will grow slowly (in 10–20 years) to some in height and width, but in the wild it can also take the form of a small tree and reach around .
It has glossy dark green, holly-like leaves, and waxy red tubular flowers, often with yellow tips, and reaching in length. The fruit is a greenish-yellow berry circa in diameter and contains around 44 glistening, coffee-brown seeds. It is a calcifuge (i.e. requires a lime-free environment) and will thrive in wetter conditions in the wild than it is sometimes given credit for in the horticultural literature, occurring as it does in bogs and swamps. It is usually a terrestrial plant, but can also grow as an epiphyte.
Habitat.
In the Valdivian temperate rainforest of Chile and Argentina "D. spinosa" is typically found growing in the understorey of forests dominated by "Nothofagus" (southern beech) species - particularly lenga ("Nothofagus pumilio") and coihue ("Nothofagus dombeyi").
Epiphyte.
In 2001, "D. spinosa" was described for the first time as having been observed growing as a (fully autotrophic) epiphyte, the host tree in question being the "lahuán / alerce" - the gigantic and extremely long-lived conifer "Fitzroya cupressoides." The epiphyte communities of the largest substrates (deep soil mats some 34 m (111 ft) up in the Fitzroya crowns), featured not only Desfontainia, but also the shrub Pseudopanax laetevirens (Araliaceae) and two tree species, namely "Tepualia stipularis" (Myrtaceae) and Weinmannia trichosperma (Cunoniaceae). These normally terrestrial species were thriving in their epiphytic existence - even a tall specimen of Tepualia showed no sign of stress. Some "Fitzroya" crowns sported such large epiphytic trees as to give the impression of a 'double crown effect.'
Seed dispersal.
The sole seed-dispersal vector for both epiphytic and terrestrial populations of "Desfontainia" in the "Fitzroya" forest remnants of Chile and Argentina is the chumaihuén ("Dromiciops gliroides"), an edible dormouse-like marsupial in length (including tail). This little creature, part frugivore and part insectivore forms an evolutionary link from the marsupials of South America to the marsupial fauna of Australia. It is better-known by its Spanish name "monito del monte" (little monkey of the mountain). Largely arboreal and nocturnal, "Dromiciops" distributes in its faeces the seeds of many of the berry-bearing, endemic plants present in its range, including those of not one, but two shrubs hallucinogenic to humans: "Desfontainia spinosa" (see below) and "Gaultheria insana," formerly known as "Pernettya furens" (Ericaceae).
Pollinators.
"Desfontainia spinosa," like many red-flowered plants, is pollinated by birds, the species involved being the green-backed firecrown - "Sephanoides sephaniodes" - the most southerly species of hummingbird.
A bumblebee species - "Bombus dahlbomii" is also involved. Bee species are barely receptive to red wavelengths of light i.e. greater than 600 nm, but have been found still to be able to perceive red flowers, particularly blue-ish red ones, thanks to their l-receptors. "Desfontainia" flowers are mostly of a true red (scarlet as opposed to deep pink) but, seen with the green-sensitive component of a bee's vision, still present enough of a contrast with green foliage to be noticeable and thus pollinatable. Furthermore, the yellow flower mouths of certain varieties of "Desfontainia" would be visible by bees at 590 nm. (See Bee learning and communication section 1.6 Neurobiology of colour vision).
"Bombus dahlbomii", a large, golden-furred species and the only one native to the South American temperate forest of southern Chile and Argentina, is now, sadly, endangered, thanks to the introduction of European "Bombus terrestris."
Cultivation.
"Desfontainia spinosa" was introduced into cultivation in Europe by William Lobb in 1843. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It requires a sheltered, partially shaded position in acid pH soil.
Uses.
"Desfontainia spinosa" has twice been reported with voucher specimens as a hallucinogen from Andean southern Colombia by Richard Evans Schultes : the first time in 1942 from the Páramo de Tambillo and the second from the Páramo de San Antonio in 1953.
Shamans in Colombia's Sibundoy Valley make a tea of the leaves 'when they want to dream' or 'to see visions and diagnose disease'. It is not used frequently, partly because of its potency, partly because the plant itself is not cultivated and must be gathered in the wild in remote páramos. The Colombian name of the shrub is Borrachero de Paramo (=intoxicating plant of the mountain bog/bleak upland moor).
The Camsá shamans of the Sibundoy Valley are also expert in the use of the dangerously toxic solanaceous hallucinogens Brugmansia and Iochroma and their occasional employment of "Desfontainia" for similar divinatory purposes (and reticence to speak of this practice) may well indicate a plant similarly toxic and difficult to use and causing a comparably unpleasant experience and after-effects.
"Desfontainia spinosa" var. "hookeri" has been reported as a narcotic utilized by the Mapuche people of Chile by Carlos Mariani Ramirez, who also likened the bitterness of the plant to that of Gentian and mentioned its use as a yellow dye.
The greenish-yellow, baccate fruit of "D. spinosa" is reputedly even more intoxicating than the foliage of the plant and is reported occasionally to have been brewed into a potently psychoactive type of chicha (see also Saliva-fermented beverages).
Names for "Desfontainia" in the Mapuche language add to the knowledge of its appearance and folk uses in Chile: 'Taique' means 'shiny', in reference to the plant's glossy leaves; 'Chapico' means 'chilli water', alluding to the plant's hot and bitter taste; 'Michay Blanco' means 'white kind of yellow tree', i.e. white shrub furnishing a yellow dye' ('Michay' can also designate several species of "Berberis" which not only yield yellow dyes but also have bright yellow wood and also somewhat resemble "Desfontainia" in appearance); 'Latuy' is also a name for "Latua pubiflora", the single species of the monotypic genus "Latua" (Solanaceae) endemic to central Chile and used by the Machi of the Mapuche people as a hallucinogen and poison to cause insanity (sometimes permanent) in a victim - which accords well with its "Brugmansia"-like content of tropane alkaloids.
A test for alkaloids with Dragendorff's reagent (see Johann Georg Noel Dragendorff) on samples of "Desfontainia" from herbarium specimens collected in Argentina, Chile and Ecuador did not, however, indicate the presence of alkaloids, tropane or otherwise; and, while the chemistry of "Desfontainia" is becoming better known, none of the compounds isolated from it thus far can account for the plant's purported hallucinogenic effects.
Chemistry.
Chemotaxonomically, "Desfontainia" was historically placed in the family Loganiaceae, but it has since been assigned to Columelliaceae.
"Desfontainia spinosa" has been found to contain, among other compounds including the cucurbitacins spinoside A and B. These bitter steroids, while not hallucinogenic, could contribute to the relative toxicity of the plant for human subjects, given that cucurbitacins exhibit cytotoxicity and that certain kinds have been held responsible for cases of poisoning, some fatal, by dangerously irritant/cathartic plants in the plant family Cucurbitaceae such as "Ecballium elaterium" and "Citrullus colocynthis".
One chemical constituent of "Desfontainia" present in considerable quantity is the pentacyclic triterpene acid ursolic acid.
Also present are loganin and secoxyloganin, compounds related to secologanin a molecule involved in the mevalonate pathway leading to, "inter alia", terpenoid and steroid biosynthesis.
Liriodendrin a ligan diglucoside also found in "Liriodendron tulipifera" (Magnoliaceae) and "Acanthopanax senticosus" (Araliaceae). Liriodendrin is transformed "in vivo" to syringaresinol which also occurs in "Castela emoryi", "Prunus mume" and "Magnolia thailandica".

Birkenhead dock disaster

The Birkenhead dock disaster was a tragedy that happened when a temporary dam collapsed during construction of the Vittoria Dock in Birkenhead, Wirral Peninsula, England, on 6 March 1909. It left 14 workers (or "navvies") dead and three injured. The disaster led to a huge public outpouring of sympathy and grief in the local area. However, the Government refused to hold a public inquiry and the cause of the disaster was never definitively established. Very little evidence or documentation surrounding the event now exists.
Building the Vittoria Dock.
The £206,000 contract to build a dock on the Vittoria Wharf area of Birkenhead was awarded by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board in 1905 to John Scott of Darlington. Scott was the son of Sir Walter Scott (1826-1910), one of the greatest regional civil engineering contractors of his era, and had recently built an extension to the docks in Middlesbrough.
The Vittoria Dock - sited at the northern end of Vittoria Street - was to serve as an accessible, organised berthing facility for vessels, which were increasing in size.
Work began in 1905 and was due to be finished by the end of 1909. However, by March 1909 it was nine months ahead of schedule. The whole project was merely a few hours from completion when the disaster occurred.
Disaster strikes.
Just after midnight on 6 March 1909, during a blinding snowstorm, disaster struck. A gang of navvies were working in a which formed the entrance channel to the new dock. They were clearing away rubble and timber, which was hauled up to the dockside by a crane which straddled the excavation. The waters of the neighbouring East Float were held back from the entrance channel by a temporary coffer dam, formed from pilings rammed with mud and cement, which had been built in 1907. There was only a small amount of work left to do, and the whole four-year dock project would be finished by the following evening.
High-tide in the River Mersey had been about 11:15 pm and the East Float was full of water. At around 12:25 am the foundation of the coffer dam gave way without warning; the fifteen workers were overwhelmed by water and debris. A platform carrying the crane, engine and boiler collapsed into the excavation, and, it is believed, trapped the men underwater. Fourteen men were killed, but one survived by clinging on the dock wall until he was rescued. The engine-driver and a boy acting as a signaller were swept into the water but were rescued; the boy being trapped between baulks of timber later had his leg amputated. The disaster widowed seven women and left 13 children fatherless. It took a month for divers to recover all the bodies, and the victims were buried in three mass graves in Flaybrick Hill Cemetery, Birkenhead, now known as Flaybrick Memorial Gardens.
Aftermath.
At the ensuing inquest, John Scott's chief engineer claimed that the disaster was probably caused when the base of the coffer dam shifted after pilings from the old dock wall were removed, and this event could not have been foreseen. However, this explanation was never independently tested or verified. One man—John Jones, the operator of the piledriving machine used to build the dam—bravely spoke out at the inquest, claiming there had been shoddy workmanship and rotten building materials had been used on the project. But his evidence was disregarded and the jury, heavily influenced by the coroner's summing-up, returned a verdict that no one was to blame. The Vittoria Dock opened for business four months after the disaster and is still in operation today.

My Girlfriend (Relient K song)

"My Girlfriend" is the debut single by the Christian rock band Relient K, released on their self-titled first album. The song originally appeared as "Marilyn Manson Ate My Girlfriend" on the band's demo album, "All Work and No Play". 
Background.
Originally titled "Marilyn Manson Ate My Girlfriend", the song first appeared on the group's demo album "All Work and No Play", released on June 20, 1998. The demo album landed them a record deal with Gotee. The group presented the song to dc Talk's Toby McKeehan, who recalled the song being "funny." On the group's first album, the song "Hello McFly" features a tongue in cheek line leading into "My Girlfriend", "A song about Marilyn Manson will never, ever be on a CD put out by Gotee Records. Period!." The line was said by McKeehan.
The song is about Marilyn Manson eating Matt Thiessen's girlfriend. Thiessen wrote this song when he was 15 years old. Thiessen has said that he wrote it because of a female friend, who lived eight hours away in Pennsylvania, who he would talk to about many things including spiritual matters such as where God was taking them in the future. His friend would later turn from Christian music to Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson. In an interview with CCM Magazine, Thiessen stated "through this she changed her lifestyle [and] what she believed in." His friend would later be expelled from school and would be kicked out of her house and sent to a youth detention center. Thiessen would later state "She felt that Christianity was stupid and just this big hypocrisy. Being young and impressionable, I just wrote this little, stupid song, but that was the way I dealt with it—writing this song about how she got so consumed by Marilyn Manson."
The song caused controversy among the Christian music world. Thiessen stated "Some moms didn't want their kids listening to our records and stuff, but that's expected. People look for stuff like that sometimes just because they want to be safe all the time." When asked if the band still played the song, Thiessen stated "We're a little tired of it, but it's still a fun song. You know how a lot of bands have their cliché one song about a girl, the relationship that went wrong or all that stuff? We don't actually have any of those right now. I think we may in the future. You never know how it goes." In an interview in Detroit at the 2005 Warped Tour, Thiessen stated the song was retired from being performed live in 2002 during their Australian tour.
Awards and nominations.
The song's music video received a "Billboard" Music Award and a GMA Dove Award nomination.
Music video.
The music video for "My Girlfriend" was the first released by the band—in it, the members of Relient K rescue "The Girlfriend" from inside of Marilyn Manson. They search through Manson's organs, which are all behind doors inside a hall. In the end, they rescue the girlfriend after Matt Thiessen defeats Marilyn Manson in a game of rock-paper-scissors.
"My Girlfriend" was the only music video by the band to feature drummer Stephen Cushman.
