Inter-Island Ferry Authority

The Inter-Island Ferry Authority (IFA) is a ferry service in the U.S. state of Alaska with its headquarters in Hollis, Alaska on Prince of Wales Island.
History.
The Inter-Island Ferry Authority was created in 1997 by the Prince of Wales Island communities of Klawock, Craig, Thorne Bay, Coffman Cove in addition to the communities of Petersburg and Wrangell. By 1998, the state Department of Transportation was behind the idea of a shuttle ferry service between Prince of Wales Island and outlying communities and soon the Alaska Congressional delegation secured funding for two day boats to seed the ferry authority. In 2002, the first vessel, the M/V "Prince of Wales", inaugurated service between Hollis and Ketchikan, and in 2006, the M/V "Stikine" followed suit with a northerly route.
Traffic.
One of the primary reasons for the creation of the authority was the spotty service to Prince of Wales Island provided by the Alaska Marine Highway System, which, while regular, was often placed at inconvenient times, specifically the regular occurrence of ferries near midnight, to the annoyance of many island residents. In its last two years of operation to Prince of Wales Island (on the same Hollis-Ketchikan route the IFA operates) it averaged 38,615 passengers and 10,644 vehicles annually. In the IFA, on its first year of operation, carried 54,906 passengers and 14,156 vehicles.
Routes and vessels.
The Inter-Island Ferry Authority owns two vessels:
As of 2013, the IFA offers daily, round-trip service between Hollis, on Prince of Wales Island, and Ketchikan.
The "Stikine" or "Prince of Wales" depart Hollis every morning at 8am and arrives in Ketchikan at 11am. The ferry then leaves Ketchikan at 3:30pm and arrives back in Hollis at 6:30pm. Although Hollis is the only Prince of Wales Island community to receive direct service from the ferries, since most of the island is connected by a network of logging industry-era roads, the ferry service also serves the Prince of Wales Island communities of Craig, Hydaburg, Kasaan, Klawock, Nautaki, Thorne Bay, and Whale Pass.
The "Stikine" formerly provided round-trip service from Coffman Cove to Wrangell and Petersburg for the summers of 2006, 2007 and 2008, but that route was suspended after the summer of 2008.
A new Authority, the Rainforest Islands Ferry Authority, was created and in 2014 may possibly operate the North End route. The Authority would connect Coffman Cove with Wrangell and Petersburg, and may also provide service to Ketchikan. In 2012, the authority purchased the "Ashley Alyse McCall", a former oil-rig supply vessel built in 1992 that is long and can carry 14 vehicles and 70 passengers. The "McCall" will be renamed the "Rainforest Islander".

Marshall M. Parks

Marshall Miller Parks (July 6, 1918 – July 25, 2005) was an American ophthalmologist known to many as "the father of pediatric ophthalmology".
Early life.
Parks was born in Old Mission, Michigan to Ruth E. and Reuben Elvin Parks. In 1939, he earned a BS from Illinois College and in 1943 graduated from the Saint Louis University School of Medicine. His success in medical school gained him induction into Alpha Omega Alpha Society. During World War II, Parks served as a medical officer on destroyers in the United States Navy, including the USS "Gamble" and USS "Terror" during the battle of Iwo Jima.
Professional career.
Parks studied under the guidance of Frank D. Costenbader, the first ophthalmologist to dedicate his practice solely to the care of children. At Children's Hospital in Washington, D.C., now known as the Children's National Medical Center, they began the first ophthalmology fellowship training program of any subspecialty. This evolved from the rotation of Heed Fellowship ophthalmologists who had trained with Costenbader for many years. The first Children's Hospital of Washington fellow was Leonard Apt in 1959.
Parks' scientific contributions include:
Positions.
From 1974 to 1975, Parks was the first president of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, a professional association of which he was a founding member. In 1982, he was president of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
Editor / Assistant Editor
Legacy.
Perhaps Parks' greatest legacy are the 160 fellows he trained in pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus. Many of these former fellows have gone on to leadership positions within the field themselves.
Dr. Kenneth Wright, a former Parks fellow and current director of Pediatric Ophthalmology Research and Education at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, published a tribute to Dr. Parks in the medical text Pediatric Ophthalmology &amp; Strabismus, calling him “the driving force that has led to the development and maturation of our specialty, pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus.” 
Family life.
Parks and his late wife, Angeline Miller Parks, raised eleven children. Following the death of his first wife, Parks and Martha McSteen Parks married and resided in Washington, D.C. for 14 years prior to his death. He is a devout Catholic.

Patrick Quentin

Patrick Quentin, Q. Patrick and Jonathan Stagge were pen names under which Hugh Callingham Wheeler (19 March 1912 – 26 July 1987), Richard Wilson Webb (August 1901 – December 1966), Martha Mott Kelley (30 April 1906 – 2005) and Mary Louise White Aswell (3 June 1902 – 24 December 1984) wrote detective fiction. In some foreign countries their books have been published under the variant Quentin Patrick. Most of the stories were written by Webb and Wheeler in collaboration, or by Wheeler alone. Their most famous creation is the amateur sleuth Peter Duluth. In 1963, the story collection "The Ordeal of Mrs. Snow" was given a Special Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. In 1949, the book "Puzzle for Pilgrims" won the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière International Prize, the most prestigious award for crime and detective fiction in France.
History.
In 1931, Martha Mott Kelley and Richard Wilson Webb collaborated on the detective novel "Cottage Sinister". Kelley was known as Patsy (Patsy Kelly was a well-known character actress of that era) and Webb—an Englishman (born 1901 in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset) who worked for a pharmaceutical company in Philadelphia—was known as Rick, so they created the pseudonym Q. Patrick by combining their nicknames—adding the Q "because it was unusual".
Webb and Kelley's literary partnership soon ended, with Kelley's marriage to Stephen Shipley Wilson. Webb continued to write under the Q. Patrick name, while looking for a new writing partner. He wrote one novel with the journalist and "Harper's Bazaar" editor Mary Louise Aswell, before he found his permanent collaborator in Hugh Wheeler, a Londoner who had moved to the US in 1934.
Wheeler's and Webb's first collaboration was published in 1936. That same year, they introduced two new pseudonyms: "Murder Gone to Earth", the first novel featuring Dr. Westlake, was credited to Jonathan Stagge, a name they would continue to use for the rest of the Westlake series. "A Puzzle for Fools" introduced Peter Duluth and was signed Patrick Quentin. This would become their primary and most famous pen name, even though they also continued to use Q. Patrick until the end of their collaboration (particularly for Inspector Trant stories).
In the late 1940s, Webb's contributions gradually decreased due to health problems. From the 1950s and on, Wheeler continued writing as Patrick Quentin on his own, and also had one book published under his own name. In the 1960s and '70s, Wheeler achieved success as a playwright and librettist, and his output as Quentin Patrick slowed and then ceased altogether after 1965. 
Writing.
The early Q. Patrick detective stories generally follow the Golden Age "whodunit" conventions, with elaborate puzzle mysteries reminiscent of Agatha Christie or John Dickson Carr. In the 1940s, the stories start to move away from the traditional detective pattern: "Puzzle for Fiends" is a Hitchcockian thriller, "Puzzle for Pilgrims" a noir novel, and "Run to Death" a pulpy spy novel.
The majority of the Webb–Wheeler collaborations feature one of their recurring characters: Peter Duluth, a Broadway director, WWII veteran and recovering alcoholic who, with his wife Iris, always seems to stumble across murders; Inspector Timothy Trant of the New York City Police, a Princeton University-educated dandy whose remorseless investigations often seem to be aimed at some innocent person before he reveals his real target; and the country doctor, Dr. Hugh Cavendish Westlake with his daughter Dawn. When Webb bowed out on the writing, these characters disappeared or receded into the background.
A study of all the Q.Patrick/Patrick Quentin/Jonathan Stagge novels has appeared in French, "Patrick Quentin: Du roman-probleme au Thriller Psychologique" by Roland Lacourbe, Vincent Bourgeois, Phillippe Fooz and Michel Soupart (France: Semper Aenigma, 2016).
Legacy.
Francis Iles called Quentin "number one among American crime writers". 
A few of Quentin's stories have been filmed (see below), most notably the Peter Duluth mystery "Black Widow", which was filmed under that title by Twentieth Century Fox in 1954 as a color Cinemascope feature. Van Heflin portrayed the Peter Duluth character, who was renamed Peter Denver.

George D. Lundberg

George D. Lundberg (born March 21, 1933) is an American board-certified pathologist and writer.
Lundberg served as editor of the "Journal of the American Medical Association" ("JAMA") for 17 years. In 1999, AMA Executive Vice President E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. fired Lundberg from this position after publishing a controversial article on how college students define oral sex. When asked about firing Lundberg, AMA EVP E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. said he was fired for "inappropriately and inexcusably interjecting JAMA into the middle of a debate that has nothing to do with science or medicine”. Lundberg's article coincided with President Clinton's impeachment trial during which the question of whether oral sex constitutes “sexual relations” was an issue. Executives from the American Medical Association stated that the article had nothing to do with medicine and it jeopardized the high standard of the journal. 
Lundberg from February 1999 to January 2009, was the editor of Medscape. He currently serves as an editor-at-large for the site.

Lifan Yuan

The Lifan Yuan (; ; Mongolian: Гадаад Монголын төрийг засах явдлын яам, "γadaγadu mongγul un törü-yi jasaqu yabudal-un yamun") was an agency in the government of the Qing dynasty of China which administered the empire's Inner Asian territories such as Mongolia and oversaw the appointments of Ambans in Tibet. Until the 1860s, it was also responsible for the Qing's relations with the Russian Empire.
Name.
The name Lifan Yuan has various translations in English, including the "Board for National Minority Affairs", "Court of Territorial Affairs", "Board for the Administration of Outlying Regions", "Office for Relations with Principalities", "Office of Barbarian Control", "Office of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs", and "Court of Colonial Affairs". etc. The office was initially known as the Mongol Yamen (; , lit. the Mongol department) when it was first created in 1636. In 1639 the department was renamed and expanded to "Lifan Yuan" in Chinese and "Tulergi golo be dasara jurgan" in Manchu. The Manchu name literally means the department for the administration of outlying regions. During the period of the late Qing reforms (or "New Policies"), the name was changed again to Lifan Ministry () in 1907 and existed until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912.
Function.
Prior to the establishment of the Zongli Yamen, the Court also supervised the empire's relation with Russia under the treaties of Nerchinsk and Kyakhta. Lifan Yuan was exclusively staffed with members from the Eight Banners. Lifan Yuan was the closest administrative office that the Qing dynasty had that would have been comparable with a foreign policy department.
Guests of the Lifan Yuan were housed in the Bureau of Interpreters () in the southeast part of the Inner City, later also known as the Russian hostel () due to the predominance of Russian visitors there. It was also called the 'south pavilion' (南館 "nan kuan") to distinguish it from the 'north pavilion' (北館 "pei kuan") where the Albazinians lived. From the Treaty of Kyakhta this residence became permanent.
There was also a Russian Language Institute (), which was a school where Manchus learned to speak Russian. Founded in 1708, it was incorporated into the newly founded Tongwen Guan in 1862.
The Lifan Yuan was roughly a Qing version of the Xuanzheng Yuan () or Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, instituted by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty for administering affairs in Tibet. It is to be distinguished from the Ministry of Rites, which was the traditional Chinese institution for dealing with all outsiders during the Ming dynasty. The Qing used the Board of Rites to deal with its tributary states to the south and east like the Joseon dynasty of Korea, the Nguyen dynasty of Vietnam, the Ryukyu Kingdom, and the Westerners who came by sea like the Dutch and the English. The Lifan Yuan was established during the reign of Huang Taiji to deal with the empire's Mongol subjects. It later continued to be a separate institution for handling the affairs of the empire's Inner Asian territories and its foreign relations with the Russians.

Vilasantar

Vilasantar is a municipality of northwestern Spain in the province of A Coruña in the autonomous community of Galicia. It belongs to the comarca of Betanzos.
Geography.
Vilasantar is located in the south of the comarca of Betanzos. It is bordered to the north by the municipalities of Curtis and Oza-Cesuras; to the west by Mesía, to the east with Sobrado and to the south with Boimorto. Its surface is 59.2 km².
It is situated in an area of medium altitude, with most of the municipality being between 400 and 500 meters above sea level. The Tambre river (which delimits the southern border with Boimorto), and its tributaries, including the Cabalar river and the Río das Gándaras river, are of great importance.
History.
Megaliths are preserved, such as the mámoas de Vilariño, the mámoa de Pedriño or the medorra de Fanegas, in the parish of San Vicenzo de Curtis. Castros such as those in Vilariño or As Corredoiras are preserved from the Castro culture.
Of the romanization there are remains of the Roman camp of Ciadella, the bigger of those discovered in Galicia, between the municipalities of Sobrado and Vilasantar.
In the Middle Ages, these lands belonged to the county of Présaras, which had its origin in the Roman praessurae, desert lands offered to settlers to be populated and cultivated. The area was strongly linked to the Sobrado Abbey and Monastery of Santa María de Mezonzo. This last one may have its origin in the Suevian era, because the church retains two capitals of the sixth or seventh centuries and appears in Latin documents as monastery of Mosontio. In the middle of the tenth century, Pedro de Mezonzo, who became the abbot of the convent and bishop of Compostela, joined him.
In the Modern Age there were numerous hidalgos in the municipality, as evidenced by several manor houses. Vilasantar was established as municipality in 1834. Its population grew until 1950, when it began to fall due to emigration.
It was an area of great activity during the Civil War and the postwar period. In 1938, the mayor of Vilasantar and neighbor of Présaras, Antonio Iglesias Corral, was executated in Miraz, Friol. In the years following the war, the Guerrilla Army of Galicia took some actions in the municipality, as well as the mythical Foucellas, who acted in the area and lived a time hidden in the house of his cousin in Ru, Vilasantar. In the parish of Mezonzo was born other guerrilla, Manolito Bello.
Economy.
The primary sector and the tertiary one have a predominant weight in the area, and in the secondary sector the manufacture of wooden board stands out, due to the presence of the Losán Group in the municipality.
During the first half of the 20th century, the textile industry was very important because of the La Arzuana factory in Présaras, founded by Luís Miranda and José Núñez de la Barca, and in which hundreds of people worked, most of them women.
Demography.
According to the National Institute of Statistics, the population of Vilasantar in 2017 was 1,241 inhabitants.
Evolution of the population in the last century:
Parishes.
The municipality is formed by the following seven parishes:

He subsequently studied at the Imperial Academy of Arts from 1903 to 1911 under the battle-painter Franz Alekseevitch Rubo and the most famous of Russian realists, Ilya Repin. For his diploma work he received the academy's highest honor, the gold medal. The academy also gave him a scholarship which enabled him to study in Germany, Italy, and France from 1911 to 1912. He would later join the AKhRR, which is unsurprising given his contact with the leaders of the Peredvizhniki movement.

Réunion cuckooshrike

The Réunion cuckooshrike (Lalage newtoni) is a passerine bird in the cuckooshrike family. It is endemic to the island of Réunion, where it is restricted to two areas of mountain forest in the north of the island. Males are dark grey above and pale grey beneath, while females have dark brown upper parts and a streaked breast. The population has been declining and the range contracting, being currently about , and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the species as "critically endangered", with the possibility that the bird could be wiped out by a tropical storm. Conservation efforts are being made by attempting to control the cats and rats which prey on the chicks, and this seems to have resulted in the population stabilising.
Taxonomy.
Dutch naturalist François Pollen described the Réunion cuckooshrike in 1866.
Description.
The Réunion cuckooshrike is a small arboreal bird. The plumage is dimorphic between the sexes. The male is grey coloured with a darker back and lighter underside; the face is darker and has the impression of a mask. The female is quite different, being dark brown above and striped underneath with a white eye-line. The call of the species is a clear whistled "tui tui tui", from which is derived its local Réunion Creole/French name, tuit-tuit.
Distribution and habitat.
The species is restricted to the forest canopy, with a distribution limited to two small patches of Réunion's native subtropical mountain forests in the north of the island. Although it once ranged across Réunion in suitable habitat, its stronghold is the Plaine des Chicots – Plaine d'Affouches Important Bird Area near the island capital of Saint-Denis. Its diet is principally insects, though fruit are also taken.
Status and conservation.
The Réunion cuckooshrike is a critically endangered species and is currently the focus of conservation efforts. Its range has declined significantly and is currently an area of just 16 km2. The population of the species is currently stable but at the low number of around 50 adult birds, and is very vulnerable to localised disasters such as forest fires or habitat degradation. Introduced cats and rats prey on the species (particularly on young birds), and introduced herbivores such as deer degrade what little habitat remains.
Formerly classified as an endangered species by the IUCN, it was suspected to be rarer than generally assumed. Following the evaluation of its status, this was found to be correct, and it is consequently uplisted to critically endangered status in 2008 as it is in immediate danger of extinction, numbering so few birds that it might be entirely wiped out by a single catastrophic event such as a tropical cyclone.
Pilot studies have shown that controlling rat and cat numbers around nesting sites leads to increased survival of chicks, and the test programme of trapping and poisoning is going to be expanded. The species' survival plan also includes recommendations to translocate some individuals to suitable habitat in other parts of the island.

Utagawa Yoshiiku

, also known as or , was a Japanese artist of the Utagawa school.
Life and career.
Born the son of teahouse proprietor Asakusa Tamichi in 1833, Yoshiiku became a student of ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi toward the end of the 1840s. His earliest known work dates to 1852 when he provided the backgrounds to some actor prints by his master.
Yoshiiku's earliest works were portraits of actors (yakusha-e), beauties (bijin-ga), and warriors (musha-e). He later followed Kuniyoshi into making satirical and humorous pieces, and became the leading name in the field after Kuniyosh's death in 1861. He illustrated the "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" ("Tokyo Daily News") from 1874 to 1876, and then co-founded the "Tokyo E-iri Shinbun" ("Tokyo Illustrated News"). The latter folded in 1889, and Yoshiiku returned to making prints. He struggled during his last years, and his last known print appeared in 1903. His three known students, Ikumura, Ikuei, and Ikumasa, failed to achieve recognition.
Yoshiiku had ten children with his second wife, only one of whom survived childhood. Yoshiiku died at age 71 in a temporary residence on 6 February 1904 in Honjo. He was buried at Anseiji temple in Asakusa and given the posthumous Buddhist name Juzen'in Hōkinikkaku Koji.
Prints.
Yoshiiku's works include the print "Kokkei Wanisshi-ki" (, "Comical Record of Japanese History"), which employs the traditional theme of "Hyakki Yagyō" on contemporary Japanese military actions in China. He cooperated with Tsukioka Yoshitoshi in the production of the "muzan-e" ("cruel pictures") series "Eimei nijūhasshūku" ("Twenty-eight famous murders with verse").

<doc id="6924889" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6924889" title="Maritime lien">
Maritime lien

A maritime lien, in English and US law and elsewhere, is a specific aspect of admiralty law concerning a claim against a ship for services rendered to it or injury caused by it.
Overview.
The maritime lien is one of three "in rem" claims capable of being brought under UK admiralty law. Whilst being a common law instrument, it has been codified under s.21(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 along with s.21(2) and s.21(4), its statutory counterparts. Maritime lien and ship mortgage have a single corresponding term in the civil law, namely the ship hypothec.
The maritime lien is a proprietary instrument meaning it concerns the property: the "res". This includes the vessel (also covering its appurtenances and equipment), services rendered to it or injuries caused by that property. For example, a 2006 US case named the vessel (M/V Henrich S) and "her engines, tackle, nets, gear, apparel, appurtenances, etc., in "rem"" as defendant. The rights include "jus in re" (right on the property) and "jus in rem" (right against the property). This means the lien treats the ship as the wrongdoer; however, the lien is said to "implede" the owner into representing the "res".
The maritime lien is a privileged claim upon maritime property which attaches to the res from the moment a cause of action arises. It remains "inchoate" until the issuing of a writ. By remaining invisible from the moment of attachment, the lien is capable of surviving a change of ownership, even by a good faith purchaser.
Two significant differences between maritime liens, which only exist in admiralty law, and the right to keep that exist in general civil law are (1) that in general civil law, "Prior in time is prior in right", i.e., the rights of the lienholder with the earliest lien are superior to those of later lienholders, whereas in maritime law the rights of the most recent lienholder are superior, and (2) all maritime liens are superior to all non-maritime liens. For instance, in the United States, a federal tax lien, which is a non-maritime lien, is subordinate to every lien for supplies, fuel, repairs, etc., which are all maritime liens.
Normally, a maritime lien relates to the different marine transactions in the admiralty jurisdiction and creates the maritime claims. It will be created by the statute such as the Ship Mortgage Act.
Characteristics of maritime lien.
The characteristics of maritime lien are as follows:
Although there is a list recognized by the admiralty jurisdiction, the definitions and criteria are not the same under the maritime law of differing jurisdictions. For example, bunker suppliers are not protected by maritime lien under UK law. However, the supplier of bunker goods might have the right of lien in the US if it can satisfy all statutory requirements. In the UK there is a closed list of situations where a maritime lien arises, being; salvage, seamen's wages, damage done by a ship due to wrongful act of manoeuvre, bottomry (although this no longer is used) and masters remunerations and disbursements.
Distinguished from shipowner’s lien.
A shipowner's lien is a possessory lien which is the major difference between it and other maritime liens. The right to this lien can be applied only on the goods which are delivering by the shipowner when the shipper is the contractual party. It may entitle the shipowner to retain the cargoes as security for the payment of a debt. The contractual shipowner's lien is currently found in all contracts for carriage of goods by sea nowadays, and may be claimed if the shippers fail to pay the due on time. However, some authorities state that there is no difference between shipowner's lien and maritime lien.
Advantage of action "in rem".
Action "in rem" (property) is an action separated from the action "in personam." The action is against the maritime property such as vessel, cargo or freight, but not against the owner. This concept is why such an action is said to be against “all the world”.
Claimants take advantage of the action "in rem", rather action "in personam", because an action "in rem" is easier and convenient to institute. It is more difficult, in an action "in personam", to summon the defendant via writ outside the jurisdiction unless the defendant is a resident of EU or EFTA countries. Besides, the processes to find the rightful shipowner, the defendant, are very complicated and time-consuming due to the complex and inconsistent ship registration in different countries. An action with respect to a bareboat ship will frequently encounter this problem.
The Admiralty action "in rem" will concern when the claims and ship are put within the Admiralty Jurisdiction, an adequate and secure place for the claimants to ask for compensation. If the defendant does not provide enough security as compensation, the court may sell the" “res”" in order to achieve the satisfaction for the claim.
There are two distinct advantages to an admiralty action "in rem" in England.
1) Bringing the claim in England secures jurisdiction of the English Admiralty Court, though it can be disputed. London is world renowned for its fair, efficient, and consistent application of maritime law. It also promotes the certainty that commercial law demands. The claim can be brought against foreign ships.
2) It has the effect of turning the claimant into a secured creditor so upon insolvency the claimant will be preferred over other crediting parties thereby securing priority financial redress. Furthermore, a maritime lien will rank above other secured creditors and only is after the costs arising from the arrest and sale of the ship.
Discharge and distinction of lien.
Although the maritime lien is attached to the maritime property whoever the shipowner is, it is possible to discharge or eliminate the lien by several ways. They include payment of the claims, waiver, laches, foreclosure, and sale or destruction of the res.
The lienholder could give up the right of maritime lien either by expressed or implied intention. The intention to waive the lien should be shown clearly required by the court and the credit of the lienholder will be considered.
Laches is a form of "estoppel" for delay. A person fails to arrest the ship within a reasonable time may result in cancellation of the original claim. The time of delay will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The idea is that the holder must show diligence exercising the lien.
Another method is an execution sale in a "rem". This also removes the attachment of the lien. The new shipowner will get the vessel with clear title. This rule could be applied in case of an international judicial sale, such as an action "in rem".
Destruction of the res results in the extinction of the lien. In this case, the lien is eliminated when the whole ship is destroyed. However, partial destruction of the vessel will not remove the lien and the lien will be attached to the remaining part of the vessel.
Conflict of laws and choice of law.
“Proper law” is the decision as to which territorial law is to govern the contract, defines the obligations of the contractual parties and determines whether the contract is valid and legal. It also determines the effects and conditions of discharge. Selection of the “proper law” to adjudicate the marine contract is a difficult task in Admiralty Jurisdiction because the issue of whether enforcement of the maritime lien is allowed by international law may turn on interpretation of the law of the country where the litigation is. So, the question is over the priority of the law where the lien was created ("lex loci"), as opposed to the law of where the court exercising jurisdiction ("lex fori").. For example, in the Republic of Korea, Korean Courts shall look to the law of the country of the vessel.
The answer is found in the application of a multiplicity of contract analysis process. The court will weight and analyze all related factors between the transaction and the respective legal systems by a case-by-case analysis. The factors may include: (a) the need of the international system; (b) the protection of justified expectation; (c) ease in determination and application of the law to be applied; (d) relevant policies of other interested states; (e) the place of the wrong; (f) the law of flag; (g) the allegiance or domicile of the injured party; (h) the law of forum; (i) the place of the contract; (j) the allegiance of the defendant shipowner and so on. The prefect decision will result from a balance between the relevant factors.
However, the US courts will choose the factors which could be applied to protect the American. If the relevant factors direct to select international law, the case may be dismissed on the grounds of "forum non conveniens". If the choice of law is to apply the US law, the court will retain jurisdiction. The reason for this is that Federal Maritime Lien Act is used to protect Americans, not the foreigners.

Singapore Prison Service

The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) is a government agency of Singapore under the Ministry of Home Affairs. Based in Changi Prison Complex in the eastern part of Singapore, the service runs 14 prisons and drug rehabilitation centres in the country. Its responsibilities encompass the safe custody, rehabilitation and aftercare of offenders, and preventive education.
History.
Under British colonial rule (1825–1965).
On 18 April 1825, the first batch of penal convicts arrived in British-ruled Singapore and were housed in temporary huts along the Bras Basah Canal. The philosophy of deterrence through punitive measures rather than rehabilitation was adopted. In 1847, Outram Prison was built at Pearl's Hill but overcrowding remained a major issue and a continued punitive approach in prison management led to a high rate of recidivism.
In 1936, Changi Prison was opened and operational as a maximum security prison and as a training ground for the reform and rehabilitation of its inmates.
From 1942 to 1945 during World War II, Changi Prison was used as a prisoner-of-war camp.
After the war, the Singapore Prison Service was institutionalised as a government department in 1946 and G.E.W.W. Bayly became its first Commissioner.
Post-independence (1965–1999).
After Singapore gained independence in 1965, Quek Shi Lei was appointed Director of Prisons on 1 November 1973.
The Ministry of Home Affairs set up a Prisons Re-Organisation Committee to review the system of rehabilitation, industrial training and work discipline. A new system of classification was then adopted in which inmates were grouped into 16 classes under three broad categories.
On 1 January 1988, Tee Tua Ba took over Quek as Director of Prisons. Quek remained as an advisor to the Singapore Prison Service while serving as chief executive officer of the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE), which is now known as Yellow Ribbon Singapore.
When Tee was posted to the Singapore Police Force as Commissioner of Police on 1 July 1992, Poh Geok Ek took over as Director of Prisons and served until his retirement on 1 November 1998, after which he was succeeded by Chua Chin Kiat.
On 23 April 1994, Tanah Merah Prison and Changi Women's Prison were officially opened by Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng. On 31 December 1999, at the groundbreaking ceremony for the redevelopment of Changi Prison Complex, Wong also unveiled the new vision and revised mission for the Singapore Prison Service, together with the service's tagline "Captain of Lives".
2000–present.
On 3 January 2000, Kaki Bukit Centre was established as a prison school for inmates' education and skills learning. Teaching resources were centralised and more inmates were able to pursue further education.
In the present-day, Changi Prison Complex houses the most serious offenders in the country, including those serving long sentences (including life imprisonment) and those who have been sentenced to death. The prison complex serves as the detention centre for death row inmates before they are executed by long-drop hanging, which traditionally takes place on a Friday morning. Corporal punishment, in the form of caning, is also carried out twice a week in the prison complex.
The Yellow Ribbon Project, formerly the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises, was renamed and launched on 2 October 2004 to raise public awareness and acceptance towards ex-offenders and support their re-integration into society.
On 1 November 2007, Ng Joo Hee succeeded Chua Chin Kiat as Director of Prisons after the latter left to serve as the executive director of Aetos Security Management. In the same year, Selarang Park Prison was also transformed to a community supervision centre to manage inmates on community-based programmes and released on supervision.
After two years as Director of Prisons, Ng was transferred to the Singapore Police Force to serve as Commissioner of Police. On 1 January 2010, Soh Wai Wah took over office as Director of Prisons. During his tenure, Soh oversaw the opening of Cluster B in Changi Prison Complex on 20 January 2010. The title "Director of Prisons" was also changed to "Commissioner of Prisons" during this time.
On 10 December 2012, it was announced that a new prison headquarters for Changi Prison Complex would be constructed by December 2014 at a cost of S$118.5 million. The project was awarded to Sembawang Engineers and Constructors, which is owned by Indian EPC company Punj Lloyd. After its construction, the prison headquarters has four main buildings and several smaller ancillary buildings for office facilities, a multi-purpose hall, a club house and an auditorium. It is also located closer to Clusters A and B within the prison complex.
In October 2016, Desmond Chin replaced Soh as Commissioner of Prisons. During Chin's tenure, the Singapore Prison Service obtained the Singapore Quality Award in 2019. Chin also oversaw various initiatives under the service's 2025 transformation plans, including the "Prisons Without Guards" programme which uses technology to automate mundane and routine tasks, as well as the "Prisons Without Walls" programmes which allows more inmates to be supervised in the community and support their reintegration into society.
On 28 September 2020, Shie Yong Lee succeeded Chin as Commissioner of Prisons, becoming the first woman to take up this role in Singapore.
Organisation.
The Singapore Prison Service is a uniformed organisation under the Ministry of Home Affairs. Its responsibilities encompass the safe custody, rehabilitation and aftercare of offenders, and preventive education. Its staff comprises uniformed officers as well as civilian staff, including psychologists and counsellors
Rank Structure.
The rank structure of Singapore Prison Service is as such, in order of ascending seniority:
Organisational structure.
The Singapore Prison Service currently administers 15 institutions. They make up the service's line units and are grouped under five Commands – Cluster A and B contain five institutions each, which are situated within Changi Prison Complex. Cluster C, with two institutions, is situated at the adjacent Tanah Merah Centre. The Community Corrections Command oversees Lloyd Leas Community Supervision Centre, Community Rehabilitation Centre, and Selarang Halfway House. In addition to them, the Operations and Security Command oversees and manages Changi Prison Complex Security and the Prison Link Centres.
Related initiatives.
CARE Network.
The Community Action for the Rehabilitation of Ex-Offenders (CARE) Network was formed in May 2000 to coordinate and to improve the effectiveness of various agencies engaging in rehabilitative works for ex-offenders in Singapore.
The CARE Network is the first formal structure that brings together key community and government agencies to promote seamless in-care to aftercare support for ex-offenders. The network consists of eight major community and government organisations responsible for the rehabilitation of ex-offenders.
Community-Based Programmes.
Overseen by the Community Operations Command (COMC), Community-Based Programmes represent a step-down approach to help offenders make a seamless transition from incare to aftercare by allowing them to serve the tail-end of their sentences in the community. These include the Home Detention Scheme, Halfway House Scheme and Work Release Scheme, where offenders are supervised and counselled by officers from different community and government agencies. In 2018, there were 1,098 inmates on Community-Based Programmes, an increase of 15.4% from the previous year.
Technology.
In 2017, the Singapore Prison Service announced its Prison Without Guards transformation plan, which uses technology to enhance operational capabilities and enable prison officers to take up higher order jobs.
Rolled out to all institutions in October 2015, iKiosk has multiple functions that allow inmates to perform self-service tasks. This includes submitting administrative requests (for example, asking for extra letter-writing materials), checking the status of these requests and redeeming privileges.
Launched as part of a pilot project in 2017 in Changi Prison Complex, the Digital Rehabilitation Records Management System automatically tracks inmate activities and attendance records through near field communications technology embedded within inmates’ wrist tags. Inmates can also make purchases by scanning their wrist tags at self-service vending machines.
The Millimetre Wave Body Scanner is designed to screen and detect hidden or contraband objects under inmates' clothing and reduce the reliance on physical searches.
Avatar, launched in 2018, is a human behaviour detection system that uses facial recognition technology and video analytics to recognise aggression and detect abnormal activities in the cell. The system triggers an alert within 15 to 30 seconds of detecting such actions, which could include violence, fighting or suicide attempts.
The Digitisation of Inmate Rehabilitation and Corrections Tool (DIRECT), launched in 2019, provides inmates with shared tablets that allow them to access apps such as e-books, e-news, e-letters and e-learning to support them in their rehabilitation.
Equipment.
Although the Singapore Prison Service officers are armed with less-than-lethal weapons such as the Monadnock PR-24 side handle baton/knightstick (more commonly known as the T-baton) and pepper spray while on duty, they are trained in firearms, which may be issued depending on the circumstances.

Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation

The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation abbreviated as (MSRTC, or simply ST), is the state-run bus service of Maharashtra, India, which serves routes to towns and cities within Maharashtra as well as to its adjoining states. It also offers a facility for online booking of tickets for all buses. Recently from 21 May 2020, the Corporation started goods transportation, private bus body building, and private vehicle tyre remoulding. In the future, the Corporation plans to start petrol pumps for private vehicles all over the Maharashtra.
History.
The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation was established by the State Government of Maharashtra as per the provision in Section 3 of RTC Act 1950. The MSRTC operates its services by the approved scheme of road transport published vide Notification MVA 3173/30303-XIIA dated 29 November 1973 in the official gazette. The area covered by the scheme is the entire area of the state of Maharashtra. The undertaking is operating stage and contract carriage services in the entire area of the state of Maharashtra except S.T. undertaking defined under Section 68 A (b) of M. V. Act and other exceptions published in the scheme. The first bus was flagged off from Pune to Ahmednagar in 1948.
In the 1920s, various entrepreneurs started operations in the public transport sector. Till the Motor Vehicle Act came into being in 1939, there were no regulations monitoring their activities which resulted in arbitrary competition and unregulated fares. The implementation of the Act rectified matters to some extent. The individual operators were asked to form a union on defined routes in a particular area. This also proved to be beneficial for travellers as some sort of schedule set in; with a time table, designated pick-up points, conductors, and fixed ticket prices. This was the state of affairs till 1948, when the then Bombay State Government, with the late Morarji Desai as the home minister, started its own state road transport service, called State Transport Bombay. And, with this, the first blue and silver-topped bus took off from Pune to Ahmednagar.
There were 10 makes of buses in use then – Chevrolet, Ford Motor Company, Bedford Vehicles, Seddon Atkinson, Studebaker, Morris Commercial, Albion Motors, Ashok Leyland, Commer and Fiat. In the early 1950s, two luxury coaches were also introduced with Morris Commercial Chassis. These were called Neelkamal and Giriyarohini and used to ply on the Pune-Mahabaleshwar route. They had two by two seats, curtains, interior decoration, a clock, and green tinted windows.
In 1950, a Road Transport Corporation Act was passed by the Central Government which delegated powers to states to form their individual road transport corporations with the Central Government contributing one-third of the capital. The Bombay State Road Transport Corporation (BSRTC) thus came into being, later changing its name to MSRTC with the re-organization of the state.
The ST started with 30 Bedford buses having wooden bodies, coir seats. The fare charged on the Pune-Nagar route was nine paisa. With time, the S.T. buses underwent many changes, including increasing the seating capacity from the original 30 to 45 to the present 54, introduction of all-steel bodies to replace wooden bodies to make them stronger and cushion seats for more comfort. Later, in 1960, aluminium bodies were introduced as steel corrodes, especially in coastal areas, and the colour code also changed to red from the blue and silver. A partial night service was launched in 1968; the overnight service about a decade later and the semi-luxury class came into being during the 1982 Asian Games.
The S.T. buses are also used for transportation of the postal mail, distribution of medicines, newspapers and even tiffins sent by people from rural areas to their relatives in cities. They also are used to transport agricultural goods to cities.
Fleet.
MSRTC is operating a fleet of approximately 15,512 buses that ferry 8.7 million passengers daily.
The Ordinary, Parivartan, Asiad and City Buses are built at MSRTC's in-house workshops at Pune city, Aurangabad, and Nagpur on Ashok Leyland and TATA chassis. These workshops produce as many as 20,000 buses per year on average. The corporation has nine tyre retreading plants along with 32 divisional workshops. The Shivneri air-conditioned bus service consists of Volvo 9400R and Scania Metrolink buses. The Shivshahi buses are air-conditioned luxury buses which are operated by MSRTC and some private contractors.
In 2018, MSRTC added approximately a 1,000 special non-AC Vithai buses, which were introduced to ferry passengers to the pilgrim town of Pandharpur in Solapur district. They have a seating capacity of 45 seats and a similar design to that of 'Parivartan' buses.
In 2019, the MSRTC introduced new non-air-conditioned buses with beds and recliner chairs specially designed for long overnight routes. Extra facilities like reading lamp, night lamp, charging point, fan and two huge storage compartments have also been provided.
MSRTC’s first electric bus 'Shivai' that plies from Pune to Ahmednagar was flagged from Pune in presence of the then Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and the then state Transport Minister Anil Parab on 1 June 2022. MSRTC would get 50 electric buses in July 2022 which will be deployed from Pune to four cities — Nashik, Solapur, Kolhapur and Sambhajinagar.
In 2024 MSRTC gave contract to Ashok Leyland for procurement of 2000 non A/c ordinary buses(Lalpari). MSRTC plans to induct 300 buses per month in the fleet from March 2025.
Passengers will be able to know the live location of ST buses through a new mobile app developed by ST Corporation

NathJal.
On Monday, November 2, 2020, MSRTC has launched 'Nathjal' with a focus to provide low-cost and pure potable water to the commuters. The bottled water will be available at the bus stations for INR 10 and 15, and a private company based out of Pune has been selected for bottled water supply. The new initiative was inaugurated by Transport Minister and President of ST Corporation Adv. Anil Parab.
The corporation plans to sell the drinking water at every bus stand of the corporation. Talking about the same, he said, "The bottled water of other companies cannot be sold on ST stands. The MSRTC has taken the responsibility of making quality water available to the passengers at affordable rates." Over the decades, Maharashtra has seen a great tradition of Warkari sector, whereby the Guru is called 'Nath'. Sharing more, Minister Parab said that the official bottled drinking water being named 'Nathjal' is a moment of honour for Maharashtra.
Which aims to increase its revenue. 
2021–22 strike.
During the COVID-19 lockdown in India which started in March 2020, MSTRC was unable to process salaries of employees for many months. Salaries of nearly 90,000 employees were held up for 3–4 months, leading to few employees committing suicides finding it difficult to meet their needs. Employees put in various demands in front of the then Maharashtra government; like pay hike, remunerations for losses and also to consider merger of MSTRC with state government by which benefits of state government would get extended to the employees of MSTRC. With failure to reach any conclusion on demands; over 92,600 employees of MSTRC went on strike from 27 October 2021.

Jackson River (Virginia)

The Jackson River is a major tributary of the James River in the U.S. state of Virginia, flowing . The James River is formed by the confluence of the Jackson River and the Cowpasture River.
Course.
The Jackson River rises in Highland County, Virginia, near the border of West Virginia. It flows south between Back Creek Mountain and Jack Mountain, entering Bath County, where it continues to flow south. The Jackson River is impounded by Gathright Dam in Alleghany County, creating Lake Moomaw. From the dam, Jackson River flows south and then east through Alleghany County, through the city of Covington and the town of Clifton Forge, before joining with the Cowpasture River to create the James River.
The river is named for the first white settler on its banks, William Jackson, who received a grant of from King George II in 1750. Jackson was possibly an acquaintance of Alexander Dunlap, the first white settler on the Calfpasture River.

Renaissance (Lionel Richie album)

Renaissance is the sixth studio album by American singer Lionel Richie. It was released by The Island Def Jam Music Group on October 16, 2000 in the United States. A breakaway from his previous two albums "Louder Than Words" (1996) and "Time" (1998) which had been released after a decade-long hiatus and featured chief production from James Anthony Carmichael, Richie consulted a team of new collaborators to work with him, including Walter Afanasieff, Brian Rawling, Daryl Simmons, and Mark Taylor as well as Rodney Jerkins and his brother Fred.
Upon release, "Renaissance" earned largely mixed reviews, with critics comparing it to other Eurodance-influenced, Taylor-produced albums such as Cher's "Believe" (1998), Enrique Iglesias' "Enrique" (1999), and Tina Turner's "Twenty Four Seven" (1999). Commercially, it became Richie's most successful album since "Dancing on the Ceiling" (1986), particularly in German-speaking Europe, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, where it entered the top ten of the albums charts and was certified gold or platinum, respectively. Lead single "Angel", a top ten hit throughout Europe, received a Grammy nomination in the category of Best Dance Recording.
Critical reception.
Upon release, "Renaissance" received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 48 based on 6 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews". "Billboard" wrote that "equal parts Cher's "Believe" and Enrique Iglesias' "Enrique", "Renaissance" finds Richie in an oh-so-contemporary setting, encompassing uptempo dance, Latin-hued and funky pop, and power ballads [..] While this may sound like a farfetched concept on paper, it works surprisingly well on disc – albeit without breaking any new ground." "Rolling Stone" critic Richard Skanse described "Renaissance" as "unabashedly slick adult contemporary fare – file between Eric Clapton's work with Babyface and the last Tina Turner album – but Richie can still write and sing the hell out of a get-you-right-there-where-it-hurts ballad [...] Richie scores a hit with it himself."
AllMusic editor Liana Jonas found that "Renaissance" was "another post-Commodores album that misses the mark. Most of the songs don't particularly fit any radio format, with the exception of adult contemporary, but that's not the problem. Lacking a radio home doesn't make for a bad recording. It's the material on "Renaissance", which is uninteresting, and Richie's voice is often out of place with the music [...] It's painful to hear such floundering work by a performer who listeners know can do better." "Entertainment Weekly" critic Matt Diehl remarked that "on "Reniassance", the soul slickster tries to get back on top with the help of superproducer Rodney Jerkins and by channeling Cher on the Eurodisco "Angel". But the sappy lyrics indicate he hasn’t ended his affair with romantic cliches, and the island rhythms of "Cinderella" call to mind Richie’s own 1983 smash "All Night Long". More a retread than a renaissance."

Barry Beach railway line

Barry Beach in Australia was a railway branch line that opened on 2 April 1969 to service the oil fields in Bass Strait. During the existence of the branch line, twice or occasionally thrice weekly diesel fuel supplies were delivered to the Barry Beach Marine Terminal in order to serve the large ocean vessels that serviced the Bass Strait oil rigs south of Corner Inlet. The oil train was not the only main source of freight transported beyond Leongatha as the once or at times twice weekly superphosphate goods freight trains serving nearby farming communities and townships would usually combine in a mixed goods train configuration. The Esso-Mobil Barry Beach oil rail freight service operated until the closure of the South Gippsland line beyond Leongatha on 30 June 1992 and the branch line itself was eventually dismantled in 1994. The oil fields in Bass Strait are still active with ocean ships still transporting the oil drilled from the still active Exxon-Mobil Marine Terminal at Barry Beach situated in Corner Inlet.
The terminus was the southernmost mainland section of Australia's linked railway tracks. The branch line to Lavers Hill and Crowes, at the Melba Gully Road, went slightly further south, but did not link to the mainline Victorian network as it was a narrower gauge.

Canon AF35M

The Canon AF35M, by Canon Japan or the Sure Shot by Canon USA, was Canon Inc.'s first autofocus 35mm lens-shutter compact camera. It was launched in November 1979 and received the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry's 1980 Good Design Award in September 1980. It proved successful among similar cameras from the competition and sold well; production reached 110,000 per month by the second half of 1981. It was partly supplanted by 1981's higher-specified AF35ML and wholly replaced by 1983's AF35M II. 
The active autofocus system used a near-infrared emitting diode and a PIN photodiode to determine the subject position by triangulation in a manner similar to a coincident-image rangefinder. This meant that the system was independent of ambient light levels and achieved a high degree of accuracy; however, it could be fooled by glass (which is not transparent to infrared radiation). The autofocus area was marked on the reverse-Galilean optical viewfinder, which also had projected framelines, zone focusing marks for near, medium and far (lit to indicate the approximate area the autofocus had selected), parallax correction marks, and battery-check and camera-shake warning LEDs. Viewfinder magnification was 0.5× and coverage was 85% of the full 135 frame area.
The lens was of 38 mm focal length and with a maximum aperture of . A ring around the lens optic itself was used to set the film speed (ISO 25 to 400), which was indicated on a small window on the front of the lens assembly; also there, but below the lens optic itself, was the cadmium sulfide (CdS) photoresistor for the light meter. The location of this, inside the filter ring of the lens, meant that the meter would function accurately even with filters fitted to the lens.
Film transport was fully automatic in both directions, but the camera was not fitted with Canon's Quick Load feature; film still had to be manually threaded to the take-up spool.
An integral flash was fitted; this retracted into the top of the camera on the left (from the user's perspective) and was manually extended via releasing a catch on the camera's front. The unit had a guide number of 14 (at ISO 100 in meters) and featured auto-exposure with the camera's light meter as well as supporting fill flash. Also on the front was a self-timer control.
All electronic functions drew power from two AA batteries. Some of the later models drew power from a single 2CR5 battery.

Loeng Nok Tha district

Loeng Nok Tha (, ; , ) is a district of Yasothon province in northeastern Thailand. Loeng Nok Tha town, the administrative center of the district, lies 69 km from Mueang Yasothon, and approximately 600 km from Bangkok.
History.
Loeng Nok Tha was established as a minor district ("king amphoe"), under jurisdiction of Mueang Amnat Charoen district in Ubon Ratchathani province on 1 September 1937. It then consisted of the three "tambons" Kut Chiang Mi, Bung Kha, and Som Pho.
On 1 November 1947, Loeng Nok Tha was elevated to district ("amphoe") status in Ubon Ratchathani Province. When Yasothon was established as a province in 1972, Loeng Nok Tha was one of six districts reassigned to the new province.
Etymology.
The name "Loeng Nok Tha" consists of two parts:
The area of Loeng Nok Tha is so called because there once were large numbers of "nok tha" living around the swamps of the region, but they have now disappeared almost entirely as a result of human habitation; not to be confused with similarly named Tambon "Nong" ('fen') Nok Tha (Thai: หนองนกทา) in Khemarat district, Ubon Ratchatani Province; or "None" ('hill') Nok Tha (Thai:โนนนกทา) a Thai prehistoric archaeological site in Phu Wiang district, Khon Kaen Province.
Geography.
Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Nong Sung, Nikhom Kham Soi, and Don Tan of Mukdahan province; Chanuman and Senangkhanikhom of Amnat Charoen province; Thai Charoen and Kut Chum of Yasothon Province; and Nong Phok of Roi Et province.
Administration.
The district is divided into 10 sub-districts ("tambons"), incorporating 143 villages ("mubans").

Forced Landing (1941 film)

Forced Landing is a 1941 American action film directed by Gordon Wiles and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film recounts the exploits of a pilot in Mosaque, an imaginary country in the midst of turmoil. "Forced Landing" stars Richard Arlen, Eva Gabor, J. Carrol Naish, Nils Asther and Evelyn Brent.
Plot.
In faraway tropical Mosaque, as soon as American pilot Dan Kendall (Richard Arlen) joins the country's Air Corps, he is in trouble. Along with his mechanic Christmas (Mikhail Rasumny), he is thrown into the military prison. His troubles start at a cantina after buying exotic beauty Johanna Van Deuren (Eva Gabor) a drink, not realizing he has antagonized her fiancé, Colonel Jan Golas (Nils Asther). A fight breaks out, leading to the pilot's arrest.
Colonel Golas releases Dan from prison when he learns that his fiancée had nearly been run down by a car and Dan had come to her rescue. The bargain he makes with Dan is that the stranger has to resign from the military and take a job with the Mosaque Civil Airline. Golas has an ulterior motive for helping Dan, as he has been responsible for the airline being sabotaged on its last flights to bring payrolls to workers at the local fort. Unknown to him, Dan's pilot friend Petchnikoff (Harold Goodwin) lost his life in a crash engineered by Golas. Johanna, accompanied by Dan, flies to the fort to visit her sick father (Victor Varconi), only to find the disgruntled and penniless workers there are set to revolt.
Dan promises to have their pay flown to the workers within three days. When he spots his friend's aircraft on the ground, after landing and searching for Petchnikoff, Dan and Johanna are captured by Andros Banshek (J. Carrol Naish), a bandit who has been working against the government in Mosaque. Banshek is sure the two would reveal his hideout unless they are silenced. When Banshek's son Nando (Bobby Dillon) is shot during their attempt to escape, Banshek implores Dan to fly his son to a doctor. While Nando is saved, Banshek is captured in Mosaque and killed by the police.
Workers at the fort finally revolt, forcing Golas to react. Dan will fly with the payroll while Golas will fly as an escort. Johanna, afraid her father is in danger, stows away on Dan's aircraft. She is alarmed that the box containing the payroll is smoking. Dan dumps the box out of the aircraft just as it explodes. Golas then tries to shoot down Dan's aircraft but is himself downed by a box of metal parts that Dan throws out. When Golas crashes to his death, Dan brings the workers their pay and is able to quell the rebellion. The general (John Miljan) in charge of the military, absolves Banshek of his crimes and declares that he was a true patriot. Dan marries Johanna, with the newlyweds leaving Mosaque to go to the United States.
Production.
"Forced Landing" was the second from Pine-Thomas Productions, whose first three films were all aviation dramas starring Richard Arlen. The film was shot over 12 days but involved 10 weeks of planning and three weeks of rehearsal to enable specially designed sets and a speedy shoot.
Principal photography for "Forced Landing" took place from April 18 to early May 1941 at the Fine Arts Studios in California.
The aerial scenes in "Forced Landing" were a mix of studio footage and live action, including the opening scene that incorporated the fiery crash of a Ford Trimotor from "Only Angels Have Wings" (1939). New aerial sequences were flown by Garland Lincoln, a pilot and supplier of aircraft for motion picture work, along with pilots Herb White, Richard Probert and Joel Thorne. The climactic air duel is fought between an armed Culver Dart G and a Pilgrim 100 airliner.
The film "...was the first in a series of three Pine-Thomas war adventures ('Forced Landing', 'Flying Blind' and 'Submarine Alert') featuring Asther as a villainous European trying to steal American military secrets, only to be thwarted by a heroic Richard Arlen."
Reception.
"Forced Landing" earned over six times its cost. The "Los Angeles Times" called it an "effective melodrama".

Rome plow

Rome plows were large, specially modified armored bulldozers used in South Vietnam by the United States military during the Vietnam War.
Background.
The plow tractors were equipped with a very sharp "stinger blade" which weighed more than two tons and was able to cut down trees, which were then burned. When fully equipped, a Rome plow tractor weighed without the rome plow kit.
Deployment.
Rome plows were first used in III Corps (Military Region III) to destroy trees and other jungle flora that could be used by enemy forces. Major land clearance operations did not commence, however, until May 1967 with the arrival of the 169th Engineer Battalion.
The plows were assigned a tank platoon and an infantry company for security. These would, prior to plowing operations, send preparatory machinegun, mortar, and 90mm tank guns into the forests and jungles; subsequent fire was continuously directed into uncleared areas to deter ambushes while the Rome plows performed their task. A search team, consisting of an infantry platoon and a squad of engineers, was also on hand to destroy any enemy installations, such as camps and tunnels, that were encountered, as well as to gather information.
During the American incursion into Cambodia on 1 May 1970, Rome plows cleared over of jungle near the "Fishhook" region, and destroyed over 1,100 enemy positions.
Legality.
Richard Falk, a professor of international law and a prominent opponent of the war, wrote in 1973: "I think it is not easy to conclude that Rome plowing, however much it offends ecological consciousness, constitutes a violation of existing standards of international law." Citing post-World War II indictments against nine German officials who had overseen "the wholesale cutting of Polish timber to an extent far in excess of what was necessary to preserve the timber resources of the country", however, he also concluded that "it is possible to view such environmental devastation as an instance of 'a crime against humanity' in the Nuremberg sense".

Gary Windo

Gary Windo (7 November 1941, in Brighton, England – 25 July 1992, in New York City) was an English jazz tenor saxophonist.
Career.
Windo came from a musical family in England. By age six he took up drums and accordion, then guitar at twelve and saxophone at seventeen. He lived in the United States during the 1960s but returned to England in 1969. In the early 1970s, his career grew as he founded the Gary Windo Quartet and worked with Carla Bley, Brotherhood of Breath, Centipede, Matching Mole, The Running Man, and Nick Mason.
Sonny Stitt heard Windo play at the Berlin Jazz Festival and asked him to join the band, which he declined. He worked outside jazz, with the Psychedelic Furs, Robert Wyatt, NRBQ, and for the comedy television show "Saturday Night Live". He taught music lessons with his friend Eric Peralli.
Windo could play many reed instruments, including soprano sax and bass clarinet. His time in America exposed him to all types of jazz, and he was at home in any idiom. He used harmonics often and could split a note into its components using his prodigious technique and a metal mouthpiece with a wide lay and a hard reed. He died from a drug overdose in 1992. He is survived by his wife Siobhan Hunter.

Bow Wow (band)

Bow Wow are a Japanese rock band formed in 1975. Originally consisting of guitarist and vocalists Kyoji Yamamoto and Mitsuhiro Saito, bassist Kenji Sano and drummer Toshihiro Niimi, they were one of the first Japanese metal bands. After releasing nine studio albums, Saito left in 1983. The band then adopted a mainstream sound by recruiting lead vocalist Genki Hitomi and keyboardist Rei Atsumi and renamed themselves to Vow Wow in 1984. They released three studio albums, before relocating to England in 1986. Sano left the band the following year and Yamamoto and Niimii asked original Whitesnake bassist Neil Murray, to replace him. After two studio albums, Murray left to join Black Sabbath and American session bassist Mark Gould played on Vow Wow's last album, before they disbanded in 1990.
Yamamoto reformed Bow Wow in 1995 with all new members, before it became a trio when original members Saito and Niimi rejoined the band, in 1998. Niimi left in 2015 and the group now performs under the name Bow Wow G2, which refers to the two guitarists being the only official members.
Tomoaki Hokari of "OK Music" wrote that Bow Wow was one of the first Japanese bands to prove that domestic musicians could compete with Western hard rock acts. In Japan their best-selling album is "V" which reached number 12 on the Oricon chart. Internationally their best-selling album is "Helter Skelter", which reached number 75 on the UK Albums Chart.
History.
1975–1984: Bow Wow.
Bow Wow was formed in 1975, by Yoshimi Ueno who was a record producer and was looking to create an idol-like band, similar to The Monkees or the Bay City Rollers. After recruiting vocalist and guitarist Mitsuhiro Saito and drummer Toshihiro Niimi, from the band Do T. Doll, whom he had managed before, vocalist and guitarist Kyoji Yamamoto and bassist Kenji Sano, who were scouted from Yamaha Music School joined and Bow Wow was officially formed. Hokari wrote that, once 19-year-old guitar virtuoso Yamamoto joined and was elected to sing in English, the idol concept was largely dropped in favor of authenticity. Niimi himself stated that if Yamamoto had not joined, they would have never become a hard rock band.
They were quickly signed to Victor and used the money to buy a truck, that could double as a stage, which earned them interviews with many magazines and television shows. Bow Wow released their self-titled debut studio album in 1976. Yamamoto recalled that when he joined, he told the producer he was a guitarist and not a singer, but during recording someone suggested he sing in English and he went with it. In 1977, they opened for Aerosmith and Kiss on their Japanese tours and released two more studio albums, "Signal Fire" and "Charge".
According to AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia, their next few albums were criticized by critics and fans, as being musically all over the place, veering from their hard rock roots, and suffering from poor production values. Yamamoto himself has described the three consecutive studio albums, "Guarantee" released in 1978 and "Glorious Road" and "Telephone," both released in 1980, as being the band's "pop era." He noted that Saito was the main vocalist on "Guarantee" and "Glorious Road", but he took over vocal duties again on "Telephone", where he looked to fuse pop with rock. For "Telephone," the band switched record labels to Sounds Marketing System and worked with producer Touru Yazawa, who had produced for the folk rock group Alice.
Bow Wow released the studio album "Hard Dog" in 1981, which returned the band to a respectable hard rock act. In 1982, they switched labels again to VAP and released two more studio albums, "Asian Volcano" and "Warning from Stardust". The band also performed at that year's Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland and the Reading Festival in England. The following year they toured with Hanoi Rocks across the UK and played their final concert at Nakano Sun Plaza, on 21 November 1983. It was Saito's last concert with the band, as he left to join ARB.
1984–1990: Vow Wow.
In early 1984, the remaining three founding members were joined by vocalist Genki Hitomi and keyboardist Rei Atsumi, this resulted in a more commercial sound and the band decided a name change was necessary. Now called Vow Wow, the group released their debut album "Beat of Metal Motion" in 1984, before signing to Toshiba EMI for their second album "Cyclone," released in 1985 and relocated to England in 1986. After releasing their third album "III," during that same year, they found themselves without a bassist when Kenji Sano returned to Japan, for personal reasons in May 1987. He would later retire from music completely. Another Japanese bassist flew out to England for an audition, but it did not work out. Niimi then suggested that Yamamoto call Neil Murray, who had recently left Whitesnake and whom they both knew, from having worked on the second album by Phenomena. After a jam session, Murray agreed to join the band for their next album and later agreed to a tour of Japan. Although, Murray would later state that he never became a full band member. Vow Wow then began recording their fourth album "V" in 1987, in Ibiza with producer Kit Woolven (Thin Lizzy, David Bowie) and co-producer John Wetton, who wrote the lyrics for the album's hit single "Don't Leave Me Now". They were asked by Tommy Vance to create the jingles for his British radio program, the "Friday Rock Show". After releasing their fifth album "Vibe" in 1988, which included the hard rock anthem "Rock Me Now" which was released as a single, the band returned to Japan for a national tour. Although experiencing commercial success, Hitomi wanted to remain in Japan, to start a family. Vow Wow recorded what was supposed to be their final album, "Helter Skelter" in 1989, which was produced by Tony Taverner (Gipsy Kings) and was, as Rivadavia put it, a "re-sequenced, repackaged, and reissue" of "Vibe". After the album, Atsumi joined RC Succession for a tour, while Murray joined Black Sabbath. According to Yamamoto, Murray told him he had to leave Vow Wow because drummer Cozy Powell, was insistent that he join Black Sabbath and the bassist could not say no to his close friend.
Shortly after, producers Nick Griffiths (Queen, Paul McCartney) and Bob Ezrin (Kiss, Pink Floyd) requested to make an album with Vow Wow. The band reformed in Los Angeles, and utilized American session bassist Mark Gould for their sixth and final album, "Mountain Top" released in 1990. Vow Wow disbanded after their 28 May 1990 concert, at the Nippon Budokan. Yamamoto later said that the band had thought they could get signed to an American record label, but when that did not happen, "We lost our aim and then we started to get frustrated and our relationships collapsed. It was sad but 1990 was a bad year for hard rock bands. The hard rock and heavy metal scene was in decline." Hitomi became a high school English teacher, while the other members each continued separate musical careers. Yamamoto formed the power trio Wild Flag in 1991. Niimi formed the bands Lance of Thrill and The Slut Banks; both with Ziggy bassist Norio Toshiro, while the latter also included vocalist Tusk.
1995–present: Bow Wow revival and Vow Wow reunion concerts.
In May 1995, Yamamoto reformed Bow Wow with his bandmates from Wild Flag, brothers Shotaro and Eiji Mitsuzono on bass and drums, respectively, and recruited vocalist Tetsuya Horie and guitarist Hiroshi Yaegashi. After an EP, "Bow Wow #0", and an album, "Bow Wow #1", Eiji was replaced by the return of Niimi in 1996. They then released the studio album "Bow Wow #2 Led by the Sun" before briefly pausing activities in 1997. In 1998, fellow original member Saito reunited with Yamamoto and Niimi to make Bow Wow a trio and they released the album "Back". The band released an album a year for the next four years; "Ancient Dreams" in 1999, "Beyond" in 2000, "Another Place" in 2001 and "What's Going On?" in 2002. In August 2003, they performed in Daegu, South Korea at the O.K.! Crazy!! World Rock Festival. In 2005, Bow Wow released "Era", their most recent studio album to date.
Vocalist Genki Hitomi and keyboardist Rei Atsumi reunited with Yamamoto and Niimi for a Vow Wow reunion concert on December 25, 2009, and for two sold-out shows the following year, on 25 December and 26 December 2010. Bow Wow released a single called "King or Queen" in 2014. Niimi left Bow Wow in 2015 and the group now performs sporadically under the name Bow Wow G2, which refers to the two guitarists, Yamamoto and Saito, being the only official members. In August 2016, Bow Wow G2 held a concert for the band's 40th anniversary, which was later released on home video. Three years after their last performance in 2018, the duo held a concert for their 45th anniversary on 26 September 2021, at Ebisu Garden Hall, where they recreated the setlist of Bow Wow's 1978 live album "Super Live". On June 1, 2023, Yamamoto announced that Niimi had died from cancer on 27 May. Having felt unwell since the beginning of the month, the drummer was admitted to a hospital on 6 May, after being diagnosed with Stage IV cancer that had metastasized throughout his body. Niimi died at 7:38 pm on 27 May, at the age of 66.
Yamamoto, Hitomi and Atsumi reunited as Vow Wow for two concerts at Club Citta on 29 June and 30 June 2024, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of their first album and to pay tribute to Niimi. Hitomi announced that he was returning to professional musical activities during the second night, and Yamamoto later said that all three members would like to reunite as Vow Wow at least once a year. Bow Wow performed at the Time to Rock Festival in Knislinge, Sweden on 7 July 2024. Vow Wow performed two reunion concerts at the Tokyo Dome City Hall on 8 and 9 January 2025.
Legacy.
Bow Wow were one of the first Japanese metal bands. Tomoaki Hokari of "OK Music" wrote that they were one of the acts that proved domestic musicians could compete with Western hard rock acts. Writing for "Rolling Stone Japan", Daisuke Kawasaki ranked "Warning from Stardust" at No. 23 on a 2007 list of the "100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time". The title track from "Signal Fire" was named the 28th best guitar instrumental by "Young Guitar Magazine" in 2019. Lars Ulrich is a fan of Bow Wow and used to cover their songs with Metallica before they made their debut. X Japan guitarist Hide admired Yamamoto and Saito, and played the Mockingbird-style of guitar because Saito used it. Siam Shade guitarist Daita has also cited Yamamoto as an influence. "Rhythm &amp; Drums Magazine" wrote that Niimi was influential on later drummers, including by pioneering the use of rubber mats under drum kits. Kouichi of Laputa is a fan of the band and covered their songs while in high school.

Pseudobulweria

Pseudobulweria is a genus of seabirds in the family Procellariidae. They have long been retained with the gadfly petrel genus "Pterodroma" despite morphological differences. Mitochondrial DNA cytochrome "b" sequence analysis has confirmed the split out of "Pterodroma" and places the genus closer to shearwaters. They thus represent either a plesiomorphic lineage still sharing some traits of the ancestral Procellariidae with the gadfly petrels, or convergent evolution of a shearwater to the ecological niche of gadfly petrels.
They are a poorly known and highly endangered group: 3 of the 4 extant species are listed by the IUCN as critically endangered. The Tahiti petrel ("Pseudobulweria rostrata") is the most familiar and the best studied.
Description and ecology.
They are generally largish darkish petrels, but may have white undersides. They are long-winged and fly about with rather leisurely wingbeats and soar a lot. Though they are attracted by chum, "Pseudobulweria" petrels are not particularly prone to following ships. They often approach floating prey from downwind, picking it up without landing on the water or during a brief landing in which the wings are kept raised.
The breeding range of "Pseudobulweria" is limited essentially by the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn, and possibly always has been. Non-breeding birds range more widely, but in general they are rarely met with in the Northern Hemisphere or outside tropical regions. Today, the genus inhabits only the Indo-Pacific region; formerly it was also found in the Atlantic. Three of the four extant "Pseudobulweria" species are listed as critically endangered. All three of these species are poorly known: the Fiji petrel ("P. macgillivrayi"), Beck's petrel ("P. becki") and the Mascarene petrel ("P. aterrima") are among the least well known seabird species on Earth, with the breeding colonies of all three species still a matter of speculation and awaiting confirmation. Both the former species have been seen very seldom since their discovery by science, although the Mascarene petrel is encountered on Réunion island as a result of light-induced fallout. Only the Tahiti petrel ("P. rostrata") is more common across the Pacific Ocean, but it is still listed as near threatened. One species of "Pseudobulweria" has gone extinct in recent history; it has been described from subfossil remains found on Saint Helena.
Taxonomy.
The genus "Pseudobulweria" was introduced in 1936 by the Australian born ornithologist Gregory Mathews with the Fiji petrel as the type species. Mathews suggested that petrels in his new genus "Pseudobulweria" had longer wings than those in "Bulweria": "In "Bulweria" the wing measurement is less than twice the tail measurement; in "Pseudobulweria" the wing measurement is more than twice that of the tail."
Species.
The genus contains five species of which one is now extinct.

Eddie McGrath

Edward J. McGrath (born January 31, 1906 – 1994) was an Irish-American crime boss from New York City, who controlled the Hell's Kitchen Irish Mob and the lucrative waterfront throughout the 1940s.
Criminal career.
Born to Irish immigrant parents, McGrath grew up in the Gashouse District on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. In contrast to other gangsters of his era, whose childhood typically consisted of street crime and juvenile detention, his upbringing was stable. McGrath served as an altar boy and sang in the choir at St. Stephen's Roman Catholic Church on East 29th Street. He dropped out of school after the 10th grade to work as an office clerk.
McGrath worked as a truck driver for Owney Madden and Bill Dwyer. He was arrested numerous times throughout the 1920s and 1930s for offenses ranging from burglary to murder.
After serving a lengthy stretch in Sing Sing, McGrath ended up as an organizer for the International Longshoremen's Association on the Hell's Kitchen waterfront. With the notorious Joseph P. Ryan in control of the ILA, McGrath became the primary muscle on the waterfront, with gangsters like John "Cockeye" Dunn (who was McGrath's brother in law) and Andrew "Squint" Sheridan as his enforcers. He became a close ally of powerful organized crime figures such as Joe Adonis, Albert Anastasia, and Meyer Lansky.
Eddie McGrath was forced to abscond from New York after Dunn and Sheridan were executed for the murder of a hiring stevedore named Andy Hintz in 1949, and the investigation of waterfront criminal activity subsequently began to escalate.
He left New York in the early 1950s and was living in Miami in 1970, when mobster Hughie Mulligan was reported to be McGrath's "on-premises manager."
McGrath's biography, "Dock Boss: Eddie McGrath and the West Side Waterfront", was written by Neil G. Clark and published by Barricade Books in 2017.

LMT (company)

LMT (, 'Latvian Mobile Telephone') is a mobile GSM/UMTS/LTE operator in Latvia.
LMT was founded on January 2, 1992. It was the first mobile network operator in the country and established itself as an operator for the NMT system, but in January 1995 it started operating a GSM network alongside the existing NMT network. Based on market research, it requested for its license to be expanded to permit the use of the 1800 MHz range, which was allowed in the summer of 1999. On December 1, 1999, there were 14 active GSM 900/1800 base stations, with the plan to have 11 more operational before the end of the millennium.
History.
LMT announced on April 3, 2000 that it was partnering with Hansabank to release the first ever mobile banking solution in the country. It allowed the user to, for example, look up currency rates, check the account balance, see the transactions done on the account and receive text messages notifying about actions done on the account. The account holder was able to choose how often those notifications should arrive with the options ranging from monthly up to after each action takes place. It was also noted right away that there are plans to provide a method for making payments via mobile banking as that was not initially possible saying that this marks the start of a new generation of services.
In November 2000, LMT started a prepaid service called OKarte (OCard) along their existing subscription based service. The cooperation with Hansabank was continued by allowing the prepaid accounts to be instantly refilled from any Hansabank ATM. On October 7, 2013, the prepaid service was merged with the LMT branding and renamed to LMT Okarte.
LMT announced in January 2002 that it will stop supporting the NMT network at the end of the year and started rolling out GPRS later that year, providing GPRS everywhere in Latvia by September 2002. Following the expansion, LMT announced the support for MMS on March 31, 2003. After acquiring the licence, the initial release of the commercial UMTS network was in December 2004. Soon after that, in June 2005, EDGE was introduced in Riga and Jūrmala by LMT and the HSDPA rollout started in August 2006.
In cooperation with TeliaSonera, LMT started selling the iPhone in Latvia on September 26, 2008.
The LTE network was commercially released on May 31, 2011, but was not made available to phone users initially. The first citywide coverage of the network in Latvia was in Liepāja in July 2012 and following further network development, LTE was made available to phone users on November 5, 2013, without any additional charges. As of April 2014, 50% of Latvians had access to the LTE network with the future goal of providing it in the whole territory of Latvia, including rural areas, by 2016.
In April 2013, LMT started the project ‘LMT for Latvia’ ("LMT Latvijai" in Latvian) – a comprehensive and nationwide CSR project, in cooperation with local municipalities and locals of different Latvian towns and cities. New children’s playground and modernized library in Preiļi, outdoor fitness equipment in Tukums, purchase of binoculars for bird watching in Sātiņi Nature Reserve and a youth festival in Saldus are few of the ideas implemented in 2014 thanks to the initiative ‘LMT for Latvia’. The ultimate goal of the project is to improve the life and environment of Latvian regional communities and support the initiatives of the individuals, companies and various NGOs in order to achieve growth of the city/town and make life better and surroundings – more beautiful.
In 2014, 88 ideas were submitted in eight Latvian cities and towns, 32 were chosen for the implementation. More than 28 000 people participated in the voting and the initiative was covered in more than 200 press cuttings. The winners of the competition received 500 to 2000 euro funding or co-financing. In total, LMT donated 64 thousand euro for the project in 2014. The project has greatly improved the local communities, as well as helped establish excellent cooperation with the local municipalities, that has improved the relations and business results in the specific towns.
As of June 2014 LMT had roaming agreements for voice calling and text messaging services with 446 operators in 204 countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania and America also including ships and satellite communication networks while mobile internet services were available in 372 operator networks in 171 country.
LMT is now the largest telecommunications service provider, in the beginning of year 2015 serving 1 113 197 clients, which is 30 thousand more than the year before.
On June 1, 2021, it was announced that SIA "Latvijas mobilais telefons" will purchase the data transmission network and IT security solutions company SIA Santa Monica Networks, which also operated in Lithuania. Until then, the owners of SIA Santa Monica Networks were the limited partnership KS EuVECA Livonia Partners Fund I (51.89%), SIA C 3 (34.68%), the Estonian company Alkonda OÜ (11.64%) and several natural persons. After receiving permission from the Competition Council of Latvia and Lithuania, LMT completed the acquisition of Santa Monica Networks on October 11. In several rounds of 700 MHz frequency auctions held in Latvia in December 2021, LMT acquired 700 MHz frequency bands for 5.758 million euros.
On July 15, 2025, Government of Latvia announced that they plan to buy out Telia Company's shares of both LMT and Tet with help from Latvenergo and Latvian State Radio and Television Centre (LVRTC), to make both companies state-owned. Telia confirmed the sale on July 17 by signing a memorandum of understanding with Latvia, Latvenergo and LVRTC, with the transaction expected to be completed in the first half of 2026. 
Main products.
While subscription based telephone services are the most prominent product of LMT, prepaid plans (LMT Karte) are also provided, along with a variety of data plans aimed at tablets and computers. As of June 2014, three mobile internet tiers are available for whole households consisting of unlimited data, with the top tier not imposing any arbitrary speed restrictions for the transfer.
Events.
LMT has been a major sponsor of the LMT Smart Future Conference since 2016. The conference purports to bring “experts across multiple industries and disciplines” to the in Riga each year.
Speakers have included former Culture Minister Dace Melbarde, journalist Ilze Jaunalksne and Emojipedia founder Jeremy Burge.
Patron of the University of Latvia.
LMT is a silver patron of the University of Latvia Foundation. The company has been supporting the University of Latvia since 2007 by donating to exact sciences projects and providing conferences and forums. The direction of support is research and development of the learning environment.

Eastern Area railway line

Eastern Area was a railway branch line built in the 1910s to service the State Coal Mine (Eastern Precinct) located in Wonthaggi. The Eastern Area Mine operated from 1919 to 1947 while this section of track operated until the 1950s.
The short section of line extended approximately 2 km beyond Wonthaggi Railway Station which was the terminus of the Wonthaggi Line.
This branch was closed at a time when the Victorian Railways was closing a number of other small branch lines and stations around Victoria.

Tom Corbett

Thomas Wingett Corbett Jr. (born June 17, 1949) is an American politician, lobbyist, and former prosecutor who served as the 46th governor of Pennsylvania from 2011 to 2015, and as of 2025 is the most recent Republican to hold that office. Corbett was also the attorney general of Pennsylvania from 1995 to 1997 and again from 2005 to 2011.
Born in Philadelphia, Corbett is a graduate of Lebanon Valley College and St. Mary's University School of Law and served as a captain in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. Corbett began his career as an assistant district attorney in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, in 1976. Corbett then joined the U.S. Department of Justice as an assistant U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, serving from 1980 to 1983, upon entering private practice. In 1988 Corbett was first elected to public office as a Township Commissioner in the Pittsburgh suburb of Shaler, before serving as the United States Attorney for Western Pennsylvania from 1989 to 1993 in the George H. W. Bush administration.
In 1995, Corbett was appointed to fill the remainder of Ernie Preate's term as Attorney General of Pennsylvania, until 1997. Corbett then reentered private practice and worked as the general counsel for Waste Management, Inc before being elected Attorney General of Pennsylvania in 2004. Corbett was then reelected to a second term in 2008, serving a total of two non-consecutive tenures as attorney general from 1995 to 1997, and 2005 to 2011.
Corbett was elected Governor of Pennsylvania in 2010, defeating Democratic nominee Dan Onorato in the general election. He was the second Pennsylvania attorney general to win the state's highest office. Corbett lost his bid for a second term to Democrat Tom Wolf in 2014, marking the first time an incumbent Pennsylvania governor lost their reelection bid since William Bigler in 1854, and the first time in history that a Republican governor lost reelection in Pennsylvania. After his defeat, he returned to private life and registered as a lobbyist in 2021. 
Early life, education, and early career.
Corbett was born in Philadelphia, the son of Mary Bernardine (Diskin) and Thomas W. Corbett. He received his Bachelor's degree at Lebanon Valley College and was employed as a 9th grade teacher for one year at Pine Grove Area School District Corbett then earned his J.D. from St. Mary's University Law School. He served in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard's 28th Infantry Division from 1971 to 1984, rising to the rank of captain.
Corbett's career has been split between private practice and civil service. He began his legal career as an assistant district attorney in Pittsburgh's Allegheny County in 1976. After three and a half years, he was hired in 1980 as an assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania.
In 1983, Corbett entered private practice as an associate partner at Rose, Schmidt, Hasley &amp; DiSalle. From 1988 and 1989, Corbett won his first election as a township commissioner in the Pittsburgh suburb of Shaler Township.
In 1988, a judge appointed him to monitor the Allegheny County jail while it was under the court's supervision. In 1989, Senators John Heinz and Arlen Specter recommended to President Bush that he nominate Corbett as U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Corbett served in the post until May 1993, when he was dismissed by President Bill Clinton.
Corbett then returned to private practice, also serving as an adviser to the gubernatorial campaign of Tom Ridge. Following Ridge's victory, Corbett served on a number of state commissions including the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency, which he served as chairman.
Corbett left office in 1997 and again went into the private sector, first as general counsel for Waste Management, Inc., then opening his own practice.
Attorney General.
1995 appointment and tenure.
In 1995, Corbett was appointed to the position of State Attorney General by Governor Ridge to fill the remainder of the term left by the conviction of Ernie Preate. As a condition of his Senate confirmation, Senate Democrats required him to pledge that he would not run for re-election in 1996. This is a common practice in Pennsylvania for appointments to elected offices. Jerry Pappert made the same pledge in 2003 when he succeeded Mike Fisher as State Attorney General. While Attorney General, Corbett's office received multiple allegations of sexism and derogatory treatment of women. One woman claimed that while working in the office that executives had shared pornographic emails between one another, forcing the office into a $15,000 settlement.
During one of Corbett's first years as Pennsylvania's Attorney General, in September 1996, Corbett and others granted the Lehigh Carbon Community College and the Cedar Crest EmergiCenter full membership of the Drugs Don't Work Here (DDWH) Program. The DDWH Program is a program that assesses substance abuse in the workplace. Three months later in December, Corbett assured that a used-car dealer in Northampton County to pay violations for state laws, in which the dealer, Matthew Connolly, complied to pay the fines.
Corbett considered challenging incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Arlen Specter in the 1998 primary, although he ultimately did not run.
2004 and 2008 elections.
After early returns were reported, the Associated Press called the race in Democratic nominee Jim Eisenhower's favor, only to retract that call later as the numbers closed. Corbett declared victory the following morning, having defeated Eisenhower by nearly 110,000 votes, winning 50.4 percent to 48.3 percent. Green Party candidate Marakay Rogers captured 1.3 percent of the vote. 
Corbett was re-elected in 2008. He won with the largest vote total of any Republican in the state's history. He defeated Democrat John Morganelli, bucking the trend of Democratic success in Pennsylvania that year.
Tenure.
In October 2008, Corbett prosecuted four individuals who were part of a $9 million meth ring in Berks and Montgomery County.
Corbett convened a grand jury in 2009 to investigate longstanding allegations of child sexual abuse by former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. The grand jury uncovered evidence of criminal misconduct, and a 40-count indictment against Sandusky was issued in 2011, ultimately leading to Sandusky's criminal conviction in 2012. Corbett has been criticized for the three year time span between the grand jury investigation and Sandusky's indictment, and for his gubernatorial staff approving a $3 million grant to Sandusky's Second Mile charity for children, which, according to the grand jury findings, served as a repository for potential sex-abuse victims.
On March 23, 2010, Corbett, along with 13 other state attorneys general, filed a lawsuit against the mandates in the just-signed federal Healthcare Bill, claiming it is unconstitutional. While Corbett personally believed in the federal Healthcare Bill's unconstitutionality, Corbett said he intended to implement the law once he was Governor of Pennsylvania, according to one spokesperson.
Corbett commented, regarding Dwight Evans (Pennsylvania's House Appropriations Committee), that while Evans had the constitutional right to criticize Corbett as attorney general, it would be a matter of statewide concern if Evans were to cut funding due to a legal position taken [by Corbett as Attorney General]. As of January 2011, a total of 27 states have joined this lawsuit.
In 2010, Corbett subpoenaed the social media app, Twitter, in order to "testify and give evidence regarding alleged violations of the laws of Pennsylvania". Corbett ordered Twitter to give information about two Twitter accounts that had been anonymously criticizing him. One of them was responsible for "exposing the hypocrisy of Tom Corbett". Had Twitter failed to appear in court with the information regarding the accounts, Corbett would hold the company accountable and also issue an arrest warrant for the Twitter representative for contempt of court.
2010 gubernatorial campaign.
On March 17, 2009, it was reported that Corbett had formed an exploratory committee and had begun filing the paperwork necessary to begin a run for Governor of Pennsylvania. On September 15, 2009, Corbett formally declared his candidacy. He faced State Representative Sam Rohrer in the May 18, 2010, Republican primary and defeated him with nearly 70% of the vote. In the general election, he faced Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato, who won the Democratic primary with 45% of the vote.
In May 2010 Corbett filed a criminal subpoena against Twitter ordering them to divulge "any and all subscriber information" of the person(s) behind two accounts that were criticizing the Republican candidate. Corbett's office denied that the subpoenas were related to the criticism, but rather to an ongoing grand jury investigation. Corbett's office ultimately withdrew the subpoenas.
In July 2010, Corbett garnered attention for suggesting that some of the unemployed are exploiting the extension of unemployment benefits prior to seeking employment, and later noted the prevalence of "help wanted" ads in the newspapers as evidence of the availability of employment.
In September 2010, at the first gubernatorial debate, Corbett again gained attention for seemingly violating his "no-tax pledge" in suggesting that he would consider raising the payroll contribution tax.
On November 2, 2010, Corbett was elected Governor of Pennsylvania, defeating Onorato by 357,975 votes (54% to 46%).
Governor of Pennsylvania (2011–2015).
Corbett assumed the office of governor on January 18, 2011, succeeding term-limited Democrat Ed Rendell. As governor, Corbett maintained a conservative profile; he endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 United States presidential election, enforced tax cuts, and cut spending.
Economy.
According to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, between January 2011, when Corbett took office, and June 2014, Pennsylvania gained a net 124,800 jobs during that period. This ranked Pennsylvania 47th in the nation for job creation – ahead of only New Mexico (1 percent), Alaska (1.58 percent) and Arkansas (1.91 percent). Economist Tara Sinclair noted that Pennsylvania suffered fewer job losses during the recession from 2008–2010, so it might be expected to experience a "less robust recovery". In addition, government employment in the state declined 7 percent during Corbett's term.
In 2012, Corbett crafted a proposal for Shell Oil that would give the company tax incentives worth over $1.6 billion over a 25-year period and exempt the company from most state and local taxes if it built a polymer manufacturing plant in Beaver County. Proponents argued that the investment by taxpayers would pay for itself over time by boosting the economy. Shell produced two studies that purported to show economic benefits, but independent researchers found the methodology in the studies to be inadequate.
Budget.
Corbett became governor on January 18, 2011. One of his first actions was the proposal of a new state budget that would decrease spending by 3 percent. The proposed budget received significant criticism due to its cuts in state-supported higher education by 50 percent. Under the new budget, funding granted to the 14 universities of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education and state-related universities Penn State, Pittsburgh, Temple, and Lincoln would be cut in half, totaling $625 million. Corbett has said, however, that he will not attempt to limit collective bargaining, as have Republican Governors John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin.
Corbett's 2013–14 budget included a $90 million increase to basic education, as well as increases to programs that help people with mental and physical disabilities.
Public opinion.
Polling reflected that most Pennsylvanians disapproved of Governor Corbett's job performance, including his decision to privatize the Pennsylvania Lottery, but supported Corbett's desire to sell off state-owned liquor stores and fix Pennsylvania's ailing transportation system. Governor Corbett and his wife were criticized for accepting gifts as reported in the "Philadelphia Daily News". Some politicians have claimed that the governor violated the code of conduct of his office.
An August 2011 poll by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute found that the governor's statewide approval rating was 44 percent. In October, after the state's response to Tropical Storm Lee, another Quinnipiac poll found that Corbett's approval rating was 50 percent, up six points from August.
In 2013, Franklin &amp; Marshall College commented on the fact that Corbett was the least-popular governor in their poll's 18-year history. Their August 2013 poll found that only 17 percent of voters thought Corbett was doing an "excellent" or "good" job, only 20 percent thought he deserved to be re-elected and 62 percent said the state was "off on the wrong track". In November 2013, Public Policy Polling announced that Corbett was the most unpopular governor in the country, with 65 percent of registered voters and 51 percent of registered Republicans disapproving of his job performance.
Natural gas.
Corbett maintained that Pennsylvania should not institute a natural gas extraction tax, due to its already high corporate net income tax. In February 2011, Corbett repealed a four-month-old policy regulating natural gas drilling (including hydraulic fracturing) in park land, deeming it "unnecessary and redundant" according to a spokesperson. The Pennsylvania Democratic Party called the repeal a "payoff" to oil and gas interests which donated a million dollars to Corbett's campaign. According to Corbett, "had they not given me a dime, I would still be in this position, saying we need to grow jobs in Pennsylvania".
On February 17, 2012, Corbett signed The Marcellus Shale Law (House Bill 1950). The law subjected natural gas drillers to an impact fee to offset any environmental or community impacts of drilling. In 2012, the law generated over $200 million for Pennsylvania municipalities, much less than the estimated amount of an extraction tax. The law also changed the zoning laws applicable to Marcellus Shale well drilling, more commonly known as hydraulic fracturing. Some provisions are that all municipalities must allow Marcellus Shale well drilling in all zoning districts, including residential and municipalities may not limit hours of operation. Water and wastewater pits must also be allowed in all zoning districts, including residential. Compressor stations must be allowed in industrial and agricultural zoning districts and towns may not limit hours of operation. Gas processing plants are allowed in industrial zoning districts and hours of operation cannot be limited. Gas pipelines must be allowed in all zoning districts, including residential. The law helped gain access to land for new pipelines, one of which transports natural gas from Pennsylvania to export terminals in Maryland, from which it will be shipped to Europe and Asia. Others contend that the pipeline's purpose is to transport the gas to Maryland and D.C. markets. There were concerns that exporting natural gas will result in more jobs going overseas, leading to increased unemployment in Pennsylvania and other states as gas prices rise globally.
The Marcellus Shale Law (House Bill 1950) also contained a provision that allows doctors in Pennsylvania access to the list of chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluid in emergency situations only, but forbids them from discussing this information with their patients. The information can only be used for emergency medical treatment, and the doctor must immediately verbally agree to keep the information confidential and later sign a document to that effect. The bill also reduced the legal responsibility of vendors, service providers, and operators regarding the identity and impact of contents of the hydraulic fracturing fluid they use.
Gay marriage/incest remark.
In an interview broadcast on October 4, 2013, Corbett was on WHP-TV in Harrisburg when an anchor asked a question regarding a member of his staff comparing the union of gay couples to that of 12-year-old children. Corbett replied: "It was an inappropriate analogy, you know." "I think a much better analogy would have been brother and sister, don't you?" Later Friday, Corbett issued a statement saying his "words were not intended to offend anyone" and apologizing if they did. His office said the interview was taped Monday. "I explained that current Pennsylvania statute delineates categories of individuals unable to obtain a marriage license," he said. "As an example, I cited siblings as one such category, which is clearly defined in state law. My intent was to provide an example of these categories." He said the legal status of same-sex marriage will be decided with "respect and compassion shown to all sides." A federal judge struck down Pennsylvania's ban on same-sex marriage on May 20, 2014.
Other issues.
On January 30, 2013, Corbett unveiled his plan to privatize Pennsylvania's state-run wine and spirits stores. Corbett estimated the sale of retail and wholesale licenses would raise an estimated $800 million to $1 billion. His administration pledged to use this money for an educational block grant used toward school safety, enhanced early education programs, individualized learning and science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses and programs.
Corbett is against both the decriminalization of cannabis for recreational use and the legalization of medical cannabis. He believes cannabis to be a "gateway drug that creates all of the drug problems we see in the United States."
2014 gubernatorial campaign.
Corbett formally announced his candidacy for reelection on November 8, 2013.
Corbett was considered vulnerable, as reflected in his low approval ratings. An August 2013 Franklin &amp; Marshall College poll found that only 17 percent of voters thought Corbett was doing an "excellent" or "good" job, only 20 percent thought he deserved to be reelected, and 62 percent said the state was "off on the wrong track". "Politico" called Corbett the most vulnerable incumbent governor in the United States, "The Washington Post" ranked the election as the most likely for a party switch, and the majority of election forecasters rated it "likely Democratic".
Despite Corbett's unpopularity and speculation that he would face a primary challenge, he was unopposed in the Republican primary. Attorney and conservative activist Bob Guzzardi announced a run against Corbett, however the state Supreme Court ordered Guzzardi's name struck from the ballot due to his failure to file a statement of financial interest, leaving Corbett unopposed for the Republican nomination.
In the general election, Corbett faced Democratic nominee Tom Wolf, a businessman and former Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. Polling indicated a very difficult path to reelection for Corbett; he had trailed Wolf in every single poll taken since March 2013. RealClearPolitics reported an average lead of 10.8 percent for Wolf. HuffPost Pollster's model estimated that Corbett would lose to Wolf 54.2 percent to 36.8 percent and reported that the probability of Wolf beating Corbett was 99 percent.
On November 4, 2014, Corbett lost to Wolf in the general election. by 344,844 votes (55% to 45%). Under the 1968 constitution, he is the first incumbent governor to lose a bid for re-election. Out of 19 Republican governors, Corbett and Alaska's Sean Parnell were the only governors who lost their positions during the 2014 election cycle.
Post-gubernatorial career.
After his term expired on January 20, 2015, Corbett returned to private life. He registered as a lobbyist in October 2021. He is currently the Distinguished Executive in Residence at the Thomas R. Kline School of Law of Duquesne University.
Personal life.
Corbett married Susan Manbeck Corbett in 1972. The couple met as students at Lebanon Valley College in Annville. Mrs. Corbett has worked as a teacher and a legal secretary. Lately, her career has been in arts administration: as special projects manager for the President's Office at Carnegie Museums and the Director's Office of Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. She served as Assistant Producer and then Executive Director of Pittsburgh Arts and Lectures and Vice-President for Programs and Development for the Gettysburg Foundation.
Corbett and his wife, Susan, have two children, Tom and Katherine.

PABPII

PABPII, or polyadenine binding protein II, is a protein involved in the assembly of the polyadenine tail added to newly synthesized pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules during the process of gene transcription. It is a regulatory protein that controls the rate at which polyadenine polymerase (PAP) adds adenine nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing tail within the nucleus of the cell. In the absence of PABPII, PAP adds adenines slowly, typically about 12. PABPII then binds to the short polyadenine tail and induces an acceleration in the rate of addition by PAP until the tail has grown to about 200 adenines long. The mechanism by which PABPII signals the termination of the polymerization reaction once the tail has reached its required length is not clearly understood.
PABPII is distinct from the related protein PABPI in being localized to the cell nucleus rather than the cytoplasm.

Kirrak railway line

Kirrak was a railway branch line, it was built in 1939 to service the Kirrak Coal mine located near the town of Wonthaggi, Australia. The last day of operation of the mine was Fri 20 December 1968. Monash Railway Club chartered the local 102 hp [75 kW] Walker railmotor to travel to State mine and to Kirrak mine that day. The last wagons of coal were not removed from Kirrak until the end of the month. All references to the line were removed from railway records in 1976. The photo in the external link was taken at State mine, not at Kirrak.

André Boudrias

André Gerard Boudrias (September 19, 1943 – February 5, 2019) was a Canadian professional ice hockey centre who spent 12 seasons in the National Hockey League as well as two more years in the World Hockey Association between 1963 and 1978. He is best remembered for his time with the Vancouver Canucks, where he was the first offensive star in the team's history. He was most recently a scout for the New Jersey Devils.
Playing career.
Boudrias was signed by his hometown Montreal Canadiens at an early age and starred for the Montreal Junior Canadiens between 1961 and 1964. He would twice lead the Jr. Canadiens in scoring, including the 1963–64 team which featured future Hall of Famers Yvan Cournoyer, Jacques Lemaire and Serge Savard. He had an explosive start to his NHL career in a four-game callup during the 1963–64 season, notching 4 assists and 5 points.
When he turned pro in 1964, Boudrias was projected to have a great future for the Canadiens, but his career would stall while former teammates like Cournoyer became stars. He would see just three games of NHL action over the next three seasons, recording a single assist, while buried in the Canadiens' deep farm system.
However, the NHL's expansion in 1967 would prove to be a great opportunity for players like Boudrias, and he was dealt to the Minnesota North Stars on the day of the 1967 Expansion Draft. He would go on to a terrific rookie NHL season in 1967–68, leading the North Stars in assists with 35 and finishing 2nd in points with 53 in their inaugural season. However, he would struggle the following season, posting just 13 points in 53 games. He, along with Mike McMahon was sent to the Chicago Black Hawks for Tom Reid and Bill Orban on February 14, 1969. He would have a strong finish to the season in Chicago, but was lost to the St. Louis Blues in the intra-league draft that summer. Boudrias would endure another disappointing season in St. Louis, as he recorded just 3 goals in 50 games, and was demoted to the minors for 19 games. However, he would notch 6 points in 14 games in helping the Blues to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they would lose on Bobby Orr's famous goal.
Boudrias' career would finally take off when he was dealt to the expansion Vancouver Canucks for the 1970–71 season. He would quickly become the team's top offensive player, leading the team with a career-high 66 points. He would ultimately lead the team in scoring in 4 of their first 5 seasons, and only trailed Bobby Schmautz by a point the other year.
In Vancouver, Boudrias would earn the nickname 'Superpest' for his tremendous skating and forechecking abilities. Despite being a top-notch offensive centre, he was also a tremendous defensive player who could give opposing players fits with his buzzing presence all over the ice pressuring the puck. He would become one of the young franchise's most popular and identifiable players, and would be the team's first real offensive star.
Boudrias would set franchise records for assists and points in 1973–74, and break both his own records in 1974–75. His 62 assists that year remained the franchise record for more than three decades until it was broken by Henrik Sedin in 2006–07. He helped Vancouver to their first-ever playoff appearance in 1975, the only player from the inaugural squad in 1970 to do so.
For the 1975–76 season, Boudrias was named the team's captain, but slumped to his lowest totals as a Canuck, finishing with just 7 goals and 38 points as he began to be used in a more exclusively defensive role.
Now in his mid-30s and with his NHL career on the decline, Boudrias left the Canucks following the 1975–76 season to return closer to home, signing with the Quebec Nordiques of the WHA. He would spend two more successful seasons in Quebec, helping the Nordiques to the WHA Championship with a strong playoff performance in 1977, before retiring in 1978.
Boudrias finished his NHL career with 151 goals and 340 assists for 491 points in 662 games, along with just 216 penalty minutes. He also notched 22 goals and 48 assists for 70 points in 140 WHA games.
Later life.
Following his career, Boudrias would go on to become one of the game's most respected scouts with Montreal Canadiens and New Jersey. In 1986, 1993 won the Stanley Cup with Montreal Canadiens as assistant general manager/director of scouting. He then joined New Jersey in summer of 1994. A long-time employee of the New Jersey Devils, Boudrias later served as one of the team's pro scouts and helped build the team which won Stanley Cups in 1995, 2000 and 2003.
Boudrias died on February 5, 2019, at the age of 75.

Just for You (Lionel Richie album)

Just for You is the seventh studio album by American singer Lionel Richie. It was released by Island Records first on March 8, 2004, in the United Kingdom. Released shortly after Richie's divorce from his second wife Diane, the album features Richie in collaboration with singers and musicians from different backgrounds, including frequent collaborators Chuckii Booker, Mark Taylor, and Ric Wake as well as contemporary R&amp;B producer 7 Aurelius and singers Daniel Bedingfield and Lenny Kravitz, both of whom appear as guest vocalists.
"Just for You" received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the album's lyrics. It entered the top five in Austria and the United Kingdom, and reached the top ten of the German and Swiss Albums Chart. In the UK, the album sold more than 100,000 copies and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). In the US, it debuted at number 47 on the "Billboard" 200 and number 22 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, eventually selling 207,000 copies. The album spawned several singles, with lead single "Just for You" reaching the top thirty on several charts.
Background.
Richie, previously a member of the Commodores, had become a solo artist in the early 1980s. With the release of "Can't Slow Down" in 1983, he became one of the biggest solo acts in the country before leaving the industry in 1987. He began working towards a comeback in the late 1990s but while he enjoyed international success, his albums failed to chart or sell noticeably in the United States. Following the release of his hit compilation album "The Definitive Collection" in 2003 and his daughter Nicole's appearance in "The Simple Life", Richie returned to public attention. Shortly before producing "Just for You" Richie and his wife, Diane, were divorced.
For his seventh album Richie brought singers and musicians from different genres. Lenny Kravitz and Daniel Bedingfield sang duets with him, while songwriters Paul Barry and Mark Taylor – who were best known for light works – wrote several songs. Another guest songwriter and producer was 7 Aurelius, of Murder, Inc. In a 2004 interview with NBC, Richie stated that he had been approached to record "Just for You" by his manager in London. He found it easy to write, because "all I had to do was play myself." In another interview, Richie said that – as opposed to "Three Times a Lady", which he had dedicated to his ex-wife Brenda – "Just for You" was dedicated to himself, an "introverted perspective" on what had excited him.
Critical reception.
"Just for You" received mixed reviews, with Album of the Year collecting 4 reviews and calculating an average of 51 out of 100. Dominic Darrah of "Soul Shine Magazine" gave the album four out of five stars, praising its mix of "sweet ballads" and "new sounds". "The Guardian" Dave Simpson found that Richie was "disturbingly in tune with the times," mixing "boy band anthems" with funk, rock, and soul. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, writing for AllMusic, gave "Just for You" three out of five stars, considering the album "well-crafted" and consistent in sound quality and cohesive. He found, however, that the album was weaker than Richie's work in the 1980s. Marcus Reeves of "Vibe" likewise gave the album three stars, finding that several tracks – such as "She's Amazing" – to be reflective of Richie's earlier work, although he dismissed the "cheesy, clichéd lyrics" of the "we-are-the-world social anthems" included. He concluded that, although the album was well made, it would please only Richie's existing fans.
Jack Smith of BBC Music found "Just for You" "far better than many would ofdreamed possible", highlighting the album's two duets as among its best and describing "Just to Be with You Again" as "sensitively produced and performed to absolute perfection". Clare Colley of "musicOMH" described the album as a "back to basics record", with "Do Ya" and "If You Belong to Me" as its best tracks. Ultimately she was disappointed with the release; she criticized the lyrics as generally "mawkish", with the album overall "chronically underdeveloped and bland". Christian Hoard and Jon Caramanica of "Rolling Stone" gave the album two stars out of five, writing that Richie had not "stray[ed] too far from his strengths" in producing the work. Kristina Feliciano of "Entertainment Weekly" was highly critical of the album, writing that its lyrics were "flaccid", with the sound unproportional. Katie Moten of RTÉ.ie found the album "disappointing", lacking originality; she considered "Do Ya" the only good song.

Benjamin Fine

Benjamin Fine (September 1, 1905May 16, 1975) was an American journalist and writer. He worked at "The New York Times" from 1938 to 1958. Fine was born in Attleboro, Massachusetts, and died while on vacation in Busan, South Korea.
Biography.
Early years.
Benjamin Fine was born September 1, 1905, in New York City to Belarusian immigrants of Jewish descent, Charles and Rebecca Fine, and spent his youth in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. It was Rhode Island where he began his college education, he received his bachelor's degree in 1928 from Rhode Island State College. In 1933 he received a Master of Science from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. His education continued at Columbia where, in 1935, he earned another master's degree and a PhD in 1941. Fine also held seven honorary degrees; they were bestowed by Bryant College, Rhode Island State College, Yeshiva University, and the University of Toledo.
Career.
Fine began a 20-year career at "The New York Times" in 1938, where he started as an education reporter. By 1941 he had been named education editor, a position he retained for 17 years. In 1944 his series of articles on the teaching of history in American high schools and colleges won the paper the Pulitzer Prize "for the most distinguished and meritorious public service rendered by an American newspaper during the year."
On September 4, 1957, while covering the attempt at desegregation at Little Rock Central High School, Fine famously sat down beside a lonely and scared Elizabeth Eckford and sympathetically said "don't let them see you cry." Fine was one of two whites at the scene that day who is said to have helped Eckford in some way. The other was Grace Lorch, the wife of a professor who helped her get on board a bus and get away.
Senate testimony.
During his tenure as editor at the "Times", he was implicated by Winston Burdett's 1955 testimony about Communists in the media before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. Fine was subpoenaed by the subcommittee in November 1955. He testified in January 1956.
Fine cooperated with the Senate panel calling his one-year membership in the Communist Party from 1935 to 1936 while he was a student at Columbia University's Teachers College. He told the subcommittee that his advice to young people today would be "keep away from anyone who talks the Communist line to you on the campus."
The committee chair, Senator James Eastland complimented Fine for his candor and called him "a fine citizen." Fine's appearance prompted Senator Thomas Hennings of Missouri to criticize the subcommittee. He objected "strenuously" that Fine was on public display after his "full disclosures in executive session."
His appearance also explained his brother's, David Fine, appearance two days earlier. David Fine was a New York movie exhibitor specializing in Russian films. He was the only non-newspaper witness.
Later years.
Fine resigned as education editor at the "Times" in 1958 to accept the position of dean of the Graduate School of Education at Yeshiva University, a position he relinquished in 1960. In 1962 Fine took a job as headmaster of Sands Point Country Day School, in Long Island, where he stayed until 1971. It was in 1971 that he founded Horizon School for Gifted Children in Key Biscayne, Florida; the job he left Sands Point for. Fine retired from Horizon in 1974. An award is named for him at the National Association of Secondary School Principals.
Benjamin Fine died May 16, 1975. He was 69 years old at the time of his death.

Chromeffects

Microsoft announced Chromeffects as an add-on for Windows 98 to play 3D graphics and video through a web browser or in separate player software, for ads with flashing text and other animation, or to generate user interface enhancements for Web-based applications.
Chromeffects promised to deliver complex multimedia over low-bandwidth connections. Using HTML, XML, C++, VBScript, and Jscript, developers would turn a web browser into a rippling, 3D space with audio and video playback. Later versions of Chromeffects were planned to have the ability to be used for representing databases in 3D.
A "MacWeek" article from August 1998 quoted David Card, an analyst at Jupiter Communications as saying, "Chromeffects is cool software, and it's not often I say Microsoft has cool software. Apple doesn't have anything comparable".
Chromeffects had problems with its business model, it was not intended to be a freely distributed technology, rather OEM PC manufacturers or other commercial entities would license the technology to provide to their customers as an IE add-on. However, despite a hard marketing push in mid-1998, OEM interests never materialized and Microsoft canceled the project as part of a major internal reorganization in November 1998. The different components of Chromeffects were separated and integrated into other Microsoft products, such as DirectAnimation in Internet Explorer.
The Microsoft Liquid Motion technology used Chromeffects "under the hood".
A similar newer modern initiative by Microsoft is Silverlight.

1994 AFL draft

The 1994 AFL draft consisted of a pre-season draft, a national draft, a trade period and a rookie elevation. The AFL draft is the annual draft of talented players by Australian rules football teams that participate in the main competition of that sport, the Australian Football League.
In 1994 there were 97 picks to be drafted between 15 teams in the national draft. The Fremantle Dockers were given the first pick as they were to compete for the first time in the 1995 AFL season.
1995 pre-season draft.
1995 uncontracted and concession player selections.
As part of Fremantle Football Club's impending entry to the AFL in the 1995 AFL season, clubs that lost uncontracted players to the new side were allocated a 16-year-old concession selection to compensate them for their loss. These players were otherwise not eligible to be drafted until the following draft. Fremantle and Essendon Football Club arranged a deal where they would not recruit any uncontracted players from clubs below Essendon on the ladder, to allow Essendon the chance to have the first selection in the concession selections, which they used to recruit their future captain and leading goalscorer, Matthew Lloyd.

Swear It Again

"Swear It Again" is a song by Irish boy band Westlife. The ballad was released on 19 April 1999 in the United Kingdom as the first single from their self-titled debut album (1999). The song peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks, giving Westlife their first of 14 UK number-one singles. "Swear It Again" is Westlife's only single to have charted in the US, peaking at number 20 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and ranking number 75 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 year-end chart in 2000.
The single has sold over 600,000 copies in the UK and has achieved platinum status there. It is the band's fifth-best-selling single in combined sales and seventh-best-selling single in paid-for sales in the UK as of January 2019.
Background.
In "Westlife - Our Story" the band recalled being "excited" hearing the demo of this song saying "Wow, this is a great song. It's a big chorus, great harmonies. This is exactly what we want to be recording".
"Swear It Again" is notable for being, along with "Flying Without Wings", one of the first two songs that Steve Mac wrote for both Westlife and Simon Cowell. The success of the two tracks led to Mac becoming Cowell's preferred producer and songwriter. It was revealed that Cowell let his father Eric listen to all of the songs recorded by the group for their debut album to decide what would be the album's lead single, with Eric choosing "Swear It Again". Significantly, Eric died of a heart attack during the week the single was released.
The song's B-side, "Forever", was a significant choice because, as originally recorded by Damage, it first alerted Cowell to the talent of Steve Mac and then led to the producer working with Westlife. It was composed in the traditional verse–chorus form in A major, with Filan and Feehily's vocal ranging from the chords of B3 to F5.
An exclusive live track version of the single was included in the Arista Records 25th anniversary compilation album in 2000.
Music video.
The original version of the video was not released. Simon Cowell had spent £150,000 on it, didn't like it and ordered a re-shoot.
The remade British music video features the band members in a mini theatre and singing on a stage fitted with lighting panel flooring while they face a screen with black-and-white videos of their studio recording process. This version was directed by Wayne Isham and aired in May 1999. The video was shot at Pinewood Studios in March 1999. 
The American music video features the band members at a car wash and subsequently washing a white car as they're singing the song. This version was directed by Nigel Dick and aired in June 2000.

Na-Mi-Ba mine

The Na-Mi-Ba is a Czechoslovak minimum metal bakelite cased anti-tank blast mine. The mine uses a horizontal lever fuze, with a very low operating pressure that breaks open a glass capsule containing acid, which initiates a flash composition. The mine has a small main charge, and is normally used as the initiator for larger charges. The low operating pressure means that the mine could be used as an anti-personnel mine.

Tree well

A tree well, also known as a spruce trap, is the space around a tree under its branches that does not get the same amount of snow as the surrounding open space. This creates a void or area of loose snow below the branches and around the trunk that is dangerous to any hikers, snowshoers, skiers, snowboarders, and snowmobilers who fall into them. If someone lands in such a well, often as a result of a fall, it can be too deep for them to climb up the surrounding loose snow before they are buried. Making the situation more dangerous, they often fall into the well head-first and as the result of an accident which could leave them injured or unconscious.
Formation.
A tree's branches shelter the area around its trunk from snowfall. If the snow is deep enough, there is a significant void or area of loose snow underneath the branches around the trunk. Such wells have been observed as deep as . Similar "wells" can also occur near rocks and along streams.
Tree wells occur outside of groomed trails and represent a significant risk to those who ski or snowboard off-piste, in backcountry areas, but can also be found on the boundaries between groomed and ungroomed areas. The risk of encountering one is greatest during and immediately following a heavy snowstorm.
Hazard.
Victims become trapped in tree wells and are unable to free themselves. In two experiments conducted in North America, 90% of volunteers temporarily placed in tree wells were unable to rescue themselves. If the snow is deep enough, the surrounding snow banks can collapse over them, depriving them of air. "If a partner is not there for immediate rescue, the skier or rider may die very quickly from suffocation – in many cases, he or she can die as quickly as someone can drown in water", according to the Tree Well and Snow Immersion Suffocation (SIS) Information website.
Frequently victims fall into wells head-first, complicating recovery efforts. Often they are injured in the process, suffering joint dislocation or concussion. When fatal, this type of incident is termed a "non-avalanche related snow immersion death" (NARSID).
In the United States, on average several skiers or snowboarders die each year from non-avalanche related snow immersion.

Southeast Kansas

Southeast Kansas is a region of the U.S. state of Kansas. It can be roughly defined by Woodson County in the northwest, Bourbon County in the northeast, Cherokee County in the southeast, and Montgomery County in the southwest. Geographically it is dominated by a broad rolling landscape located between the Flint Hills to the west and includes the Ozarks to the southeast. Some notable towns there include Pittsburg, Parsons, Coffeyville, Independence, Chanute, Fort Scott, and Iola.
The region has a land area of 13,624.13 km² (5,260.30 sq mi) and a 2000 census population of 180,815 inhabitants. It has 6.43% of the state's land area and 6.73% of its population. It is dominated by a broad rolling landscape that includes the Ozarks. It receives more precipitation than any other part of Kansas. Southeast Kansas is located in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem of North America.
Originally inhabited by several Native American tribes, frontier towns largely dependent on cattle ranching, and mining, were wracked by violence over the issue of slavery both before and during the American Civil War (see Bleeding Kansas). While the area was part of the Tri-State lead and zinc mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northeast Oklahoma, the most prevalent mining in Southeast Kansas was coal mining. This is attributed to the amount of coal found and also the quality and thickness of coal in Southeast Kansas. Southeast Kansas offers one of the premier reconstructions of early life in the United States Army at Fort Scott National Historic Site.
Definition.
The following nine counties are included in all definitions of Southeast Kansas:
Southeast Kansas with the addition of Anderson, Chautauqua, Coffey, Elk, and Linn counties is promoted as the "Little Ozarks". When KOAM-TV refers to this area, Greenwood is included. The Southeast Kansas Library System also includes Greenwood County in the Southeast Kansas region. When Southeast Kansas, Inc. refers to this area, Miami County is included, with the exclusion of Elk, Chautauqua, and Greenwood counties.

Cleavage stimulation factor

Cleavage stimulatory factor or cleavage stimulation factor (CstF or CStF) is a heterotrimeric protein, made up of the proteins CSTF1 (55kDa), CSTF2 (64kDa) and CSTF3 (77kDa), totalling about 200 kDa. It is involved in the cleavage of the 3' signaling region from a newly synthesized pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. CstF is recruited by cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and assembles into a protein complex on the 3' end to promote the synthesis of a functional polyadenine tail, which results in a mature mRNA molecule ready to be exported from the cell nucleus to the cytosol for translation.
The amount of CstF in a cell is dependent on the phase of the cell cycle, increasing significantly during the transition from G0 phase to S phase in mouse fibroblast and human splenic B cells.

<doc id="6925377" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6925377" title="Ampang–Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway">
Ampang–Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway

Ampang–Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway (AKLEH), (Malay: Lebuhraya Bertingkat Ampang–Kuala Lumpur), is the first elevated highway in Malaysia. The elevated highway connects Ampang (in Selangor state) and Kuala Lumpur. This highway was built to reduce traffic congestion at Jalan Ampang and make access to the city more convenient. Motorcycles and other vehicles with two wheels were banned from using this highway for safety reasons; the ban on motorcycles was lifted on 19 June 2008 because of escalating fuel prices.
Route background.
The Kilometre Zero is located at the entrance from Jalan Raja Abdullah at Jalan Sultan Ismail Interchange, Kuala Lumpur.
History.
The construction of the Ampang–Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway was approved on 16 May 1996 when Prolintas was awarded the concession of the highway, which will end in 2029. Construction began in the same year at the banks of the Klang River and was completed in 2001. The highway opened to traffic on 17 May 2001 after numerous delays, and the toll collection started on 1 June 2001.
Plans.
The highway was designed to accommodate future expansion of the Jelatek–Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2 section from the current four-lane carriageway to six-lane carriageways. The expansion will take place along the northern bank of the Klang River and Ampang River. According to the concessionaire agreement between Prolintas and the federal government, Prolintas is required to expand the highway once the average daily traffic exceeds 93,000 vehicles. As a result, a chicane was formed right after the Exit 1203 Jelatek Interchange for Ampang-bound traffic. Prolintas will only be allowed to raise the toll rate once the upgrading works of the Jelatek–MRR2 section to six-lane carriageway begins.
On 5 November 2015, the upgrading works (called AKLEH Phase 2) of the AKLEH (Ampang-bound traffic) from Jelatek to Ampang-MRR2 was opened to traffic.
Tolls.
The Ampang–Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway (AKLEH) uses open toll collection systems. Since 2015 all toll transactions at the highway's sole toll plaza have been conducted electronically via Touch 'n Go cards or SmartTAGs. Cash payments are no longer accepted. In October 2022, it was one of the four expressways maintained by PROLINTAS to have its toll rates deducted between 8% and 15%.

BAIF Development Research Foundation

The BAIF Development Research Foundation is a NGO based in Urali Kanchan near Pune in Maharashtra, India, that pioneers agricultural development. It was founded in 1967 by Manibhai Desai as the Bharatiya Agro Industries Foundation. 
Under Manibhai, BAIF pioneered cross breeding of high yielding European cattle such as Holstein Freisian and 
Jersey with the sturdy Indian breeds such as Gir from Gujarat. Later BAIF expanded the scope of activities to include animal health, nutrition, afforestation wasteland development, and tribal development.
In 1997, the organization received the Adivasi Seva Sanstha award from the State Government of Maharashtra.
History.
Mahatma Gandhi stayed in the Urali Kanchan village near the city of Pune in 1946. At that time Gandhi had lost trust in western medicine and wanted to explore Nature therapy. For this purpose he nominated Manibhai as the manager of the newly established Nature therapy Ashram at Urali. The young Manibhai gave a pledge to Mahatma Gandhi to devote his life to uplifting of Uruli. Although Gandhian principles were central to Manibhai's work, he believed the rural poor can benefit from scientific advances During his work at the Nature cure ashram, Manibhai self-taught himself aspects of horticulture and cattle breeding.
To take this work further, Bharatya Agro-Industries Foundation, was organised and registered in 1967 under the Indian Public Charitable Trust Act of 1950. The purpose of the foundation was to help rural communities to improve their socio-economic status by increasing food production along modern lines by making improvements to agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and other allied activities. 
Manibhai was appointed managing trustee and director of the foundation. Yashwantrao Chavan, then a senior cabinet minister in the Indian government and Vasantrao Naik, then chief minister of Maharashtra were chairman and deputy chairman of the organization respectively.
In early years the Foundation received aid from Western countries such as Denmark, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia as well as the Indian dairy cooperation. The British charity Oxfam donated farming equipment whereas the British milk marketing board donated semen from premium sires for artificial insemination program.
In the 1980s BAIF pioneered the "WADI" agroforestry model for creating fruit orchards in tribal areas of Gujarat with limited rainfall and marginal landholding. This program was later implemented in 21 other states.
Manibhai died in 1993. BAIF named Narayan Hegde as Manibhai's successor. Hegde ran the organization until 2009 when he was succeeded by his long-time deputy Girish Sohani. 
In the year 2021, Bharat Kakade who served the organisation in different capacities, took charge as President and Managing Trustre of BAIF. Kakade holds PhD from IIT Bombay and has acquired expertise in sustainable development and climate change adaption and mitigation.
Activities.
The developmental activities of BAIF include animal husbandry, sustainable agriculture, horticulture, water resources management, and various rural non-farm activities for generating employment for landless families and Indian tribal communities. BAIF also tried digital marketing of its agricultural products by a tie-up with an internet marketing firm but that was a failure.
Animal husbandry.
For the last five decades starting in the late 1960s, the main thrust of BAIF activities has been animal husbandry. This has principally involved artificial insemination (AI) of indigenous Indian cattle breeds with semen from bulls of high milk yielding European cattle breeds such as Jersey and Holstein Friesian. The organization maintains its main research facilities at Uruli Kanchan with a large group of scientists, veterinarians and technical staff. Urali Kanchan also serves as the major semen production station in India. In 2015, the Urali facility produced over seven million doses of semen. Over the decades, BAIF has established AI centres in 16 Indian states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka etc. The organization offers door-to-door breeding services to farmers by employing and training local youth as Artificial Insemination Technicians (AIT). By 2018 the organization had helped nearly six million farmers with improved animal husbandry. The cattle improvement programme has enabled farmers to generate higher income by selling surplus milk and animals. The organization also has programs to improve the quality of water buffalo breeds to obtain better milk yields. Murrah has been the preferred indigenous breed for this program. In arid and semi-arid areas of India such as Rajasthan, BAIF has initiated programs to improve the quality of goat breeds for milk as well as for mutton. The organization also conducts surveys with farmers on best practices for cattle management.|
Horticulture and the Wadi program.
In the 1980s BAIF pioneered the "WADI" agroforestry model for creating fruit orchards in tribal areas of Gujarat with limited rainfall and marginal landholding. The success of the program led to it being implemented in the neighboring state of Maharashtra followed later by introduction to 21 other states of India. This model involves establishment of multi-purpose trees around the field periphery along with fruit and/or nut trees in the field. The wide spacing of trees allows continued cultivation of annual crops. The tree planting also involves soil and water conservation measures such as trenches and bunds on the plot. BAIF and allied organizations offer support to the farmers for five years which involves free planting and construction materials, technical assistance, financial compensation for establishment and aftercare in the first three years of the fruit trees, and marketing assistance through farmer cooperatives.
Micro-insurance.
BAIF introduced the idea of self-help groups (SHG) to make insurance facilities available for rural communities. An SHG usually has 109-20 members and works as a financial intermediary. BAIF operates many SHG where conventional insurance facilities are difficult to obtain.
Sources of funding.
From the very beginning, Manibhai relied on government support as well as support from International governments as well as NGOs to fund the activities of BAIF. This is still the main source of funding for BAIF. Organizations that have funded BAIF activities include KfW, the German German state-owned investment and development bank, the Indian National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development or NABARD, and private charities such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.
In addition, the organization also receives significant income from farmers for the cattle semen and insemination services.
VAPCOL.
VAPCOL(Vasundhara Agri-Horti Producer Co. Ltd.) is a for profit organisation promoted by BAIF for improving the agricultural Value chain for the farmers in taking their produce to the consumer. It was registered in 2004 as a farmer producer company (FPO)under the Indian company law. Unlike cooperatives in India, VAPCOL is able to operate across different states. VAPCOL has a membership of 55 producer organisations and a membership of 41,000 farmers. It was started by BAIF to help farmers under the Wadi scheme to be able to process and take their produce to the market. It is regarded as second tier farmer organization for procurement, grading, marketing, selling, the export of farm produce. Products marketed by VAPCOL include primary farm products such as cashew, mango, amla, flowers, milk, tomatoes and vegetables as well pickles, pulp, jam and juice. The products are sold under the brand name, Vrindavan. VAPCOL has its own independent website, Facebook page and sales through distribution network as well as online sales. The company has branches in Nasik, Vansda (Gujarat), Udaipur (Rajasthan) and Raipur (Chhattisgarh).
Challenges and opportunities.
Some critics of BAIF argue that the emphasis on imported breeds of cattle has been instrumental in the decimation of Indian breeds. P. Sanath in the Hindu argues that cross-breeds give higher yields, but require more feed and are not suited to Indian conditions. BAIF believes that Innovation in agrarian technology still remains under-financed, and therefore provides an opportunity to the organization to continue its research and development activities and provide services to rural communities across the country.
Turf encroachment.
Even as a professionally competent NGO, BAIF has encountered resistance to its services. In one instance, when BAIF expanded its AI services with financial support from the Rajasthan Department of Rural Development, it faced opposition in some districts from the Rajsthan Department of Animal Husbandry (DoAH). To avoid duplication of services, BAIF had to leave areas where the DoAH had subsequently developed insemination facilities. There is also resistance from lower-level government employees in their perception that NGOs are eroding employment security in the government by offering cheaper contractual services.
A1/A2 controversy.
After more than fifty years of crossbreeding programme all over India, drawbacks of crossbreeding with European breeds such as susceptibility to diseases, high rate of infertility, poor tolerance to heat, high feeding cost, etc. were pointed out by critics in the last decade. In response BAIF started to offer AI with quality native breeds in interior villages with poor access to veterinary services. The unverified claims of A1 milk causing multiple health issues also affected consumer acceptance of milk from crossbred cows. These reports have led to many political and religious groups taking up intensive campaign for prevention of crossbreeding in cattle. The campaign has led BAIF to assess the implication of these campaigns on milk production and income of dairy farmers if raising of high yielding crossbred cows is discouraged. This was compounded by the Indian government's launch of the Rashtriya Gokul Mission scheme in 2014.One of the aim of the scheme was to improve the genetics of local cattle using indigenous breeds, while preventing crossbreeding to discourage the production of A1 type milk. BAIF scientists have countered the claims by showing that only pure-bred Holstein Friesian cows from United States produce A1 milk whereas water buffalo, Jersey cows, and the crossbred ones produce A2 milk.

Louder Than Words (album)

Louder Than Words is the fourth studio album by American singer Lionel Richie. It was released by Mercury Records on April 16, 1996, in the United States. The album marked Richie's debut with the record label as well as his first album of new material in 10 years after a longer hiatus during which he went through a much-publicized divorce from his first wife Brenda Harvey and the loss of his father and a close friend. Apart from chief producer James Anthony Carmichael, the singer worked with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Babyface and David Foster on "Louder Than Words".
Upon release, the album earned generally mixed to positive review from music critics, many of whom praised Richie's vocal performances and the ballads on the album but found the overall material old-fashioned. Commercially, "Louder Than Words" failed to reprise the success of Richies's previous multi-platinum studio albums "Can't Slow Down" (1983) and "Dancing on the Ceiling" (1986), though it entered the top thirty on the majority of the album charts it appeared on, going gold in France and the US and silver in the United Kingdom.
Background.
Following years of intense touring and recording, Richie was suffering from burnout symptoms by March 1986. While he only intended to take a year off, his father, Lionel Richie Sr., fell ill before dying in 1990. After his death, Richie struggled with what he described as "a massive depression". At the same time, he was divorcing from his first wife Brenda Harvey after nearly two decades of marriage. Right after that, amid the release of his first compilation album "Back to Front" (1992) and the pre-production of a new studio album, his best friend informed Richie that he was dying from AIDS-related causes. It was not until his passing, that Richie felt ready to produce new music. Welcoming his second child, son Miles, with his second wife Diane Alexander in May 1994 eventually helped jumpstarting a return to recording. In a 2018 interview with "People" magazine, Richie commented: "They didn’t know what the hell I did for a living so I thought at that particular point, let’s go back and prove to the kids what I do. And so that was the incentive. I realized, this is what I should be doing."
Critical reception.
AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine found that "although there are some slight attempts to incorporate new jack and hip-hop influences into Richie's sound, "Louder Than Words" relies on his trademark balladeering, which remains his forte. All of the weak moments on "Louder Than Words" are ill-advised forays into rap – to put it bluntly, he can rap about as well as Snoop Dogg can sing. Although the ballads aren't as strong as his late-'70s and early-'80s standards, they are nevertheless pleasant, which makes the record a worthwhile purchase for fans." "Chicago Tribune" critic Calvin Wilson declared the album "a mixed bag. Some of the selections are little more than filler – but when Richie is fully engaged, he comes up with music that's truly exhilarating. To be sure, Richie understands what's expected of him."
Cheo Hodari Coker, writing for the "Los Angeles Times", called the album a "welcome return" and wrote: "From beginning to end, "Louder Than Words" is palatable enough for the crossover crowd, but also soulful enough for his now-older black female fans, many of whom moved on to Babyface in Richie’s absence. The elegant “Don’t Wanna Lose You,” the uncharacteristically sensual "Say I Do" and the easygoing jam "Ordinary Girl" show that Richie hasn’t lost any of his charm or compositional powers." "Entertainment Weekly" critic J.D. Considine remarked that "Richie’s middle-of-the-road R&amp;B may as well be from another century. It isn’t that he can’t work a groove; what makes Richie seem so old-fashioned is that he doesn’t understand that these days the groove is everything. A pity, because even if he hasn’t kept up with the times, he has grown [...] Even if "Louder Than Words" doesn’t put him back on top of the charts, it’s proof that Richie is on top of his game."
Chart performance.
In the United States, "Louder Than Words" debuted at number 33 on the US "Billboard" 200 with first weeks sales of 28,000 copies. It peaked at number 28.

Sports in Vancouver

There have been a wide variety of sports in Vancouver since the city was founded. Team sports such as ice hockey, lacrosse, and Canadian football have extensive history in the area, while the city's relatively mild climate and geographical location facilitate a wide variety of other sports and recreational activities.
Sports teams.
A number of amateur and professional sports teams are based in Vancouver.
Amateur.
The Vancouver Giants of the Western Hockey League, founded in 2001, play their home games in Langley. The Giants hosted and won the 2007 Memorial Cup. The Vancouver area also has a number of hockey teams in the Tier II British Columbia Hockey League.
There are a number of amateur lacrosse teams in Greater Vancouver, competing under the auspices of the British Columbia Lacrosse Association. The New Westminster Salmonbellies have won the Mann Cup, Canada's senior lacrosse championship, a record 24 times. There are also several amateur teams in sports such as soccer, baseball, softball, Canadian football, field hockey, rugby, Gaelic football, Water Polo, disc ultimate and roller derby.
Prominent annual amateur sports events in Vancouver include the BC High School Basketball Championship at the PNE Agrodome, the High School Football Championship at BC Place, and the Canada Cup softball tournament in South Surrey. Also notable is the college rivalry between the UBC Thunderbirds and Simon Fraser Red Leafs (formerly SFU Clan), who meet annually in the Shrum Bowl (football) and Buchanan Cup (basketball). These are very popular sport events in Vancouver.
Professional.
Vancouver is home to a number of professional sports teams, including a number of teams in major professional sports leagues of North America, including the Canadian Football League, Major League Soccer, and the National Hockey League.
BC Lions.
The British Columbia (BC) Lions have played in the Canadian Football League since 1954, and have won the Grey Cup six times, in 1964, 1985, 1994, 2000, 2006 and in 2011. Vancouver has hosted the Grey Cup championship fourteen times, most recently in 2011. The Lions play their home games at BC Place Stadium in downtown Vancouver, having previously played at Empire Stadium in East Vancouver until the end of the 1982 season.
Vancouver Canadians.
The Vancouver Canadians play in the High-A West of the Minor League Baseball (MiLB). The Canadians play their home games at Scotiabank Field at Nat Bailey Stadium and are affiliated with the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball. Minor league baseball has a long history in Vancouver, including the Vancouver Beavers, the Vancouver Capilanos, an earlier incarnation of the Canadians and the Vancouver Mounties; both the latter two played in the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. Vancouver has been recently suggested as a potential expansion site for a Major League Baseball team although it is possible they would need a specific stadium rather than playing their home games at BC Place Stadium in downtown Vancouver. (Link)
Vancouver Canucks.
The Vancouver Canucks have played in the National Hockey League since 1970, and have reached the Stanley Cup finals three times, in 1982, 1994 (the Canucks' 1994 run was unfortunately marred by the 1994 Stanley Cup riot) and 2011 (which again incited the 2011 Stanley Cup riot after the Canucks' loss to Boston). The Canucks play their home games at Rogers Arena, having previously played at the Pacific Coliseum until 1995. Previous incarnations of the Canucks played in the Pacific Coast Hockey League and Western Hockey League and won multiple championships. The Vancouver Blazers, a World Hockey Association team, attempted to compete with the Canucks between 1973 and 1975, but moved to Calgary thereafter. An early professional hockey team known as the Vancouver Millionaires won the Stanley Cup in 1915.
Vancouver Warriors.
The Vancouver Warriors are a box lacrosse team in the National Lacrosse League. The team moved from Everett, Washington for the 2014 NLL season. Between 2014 and 2017, the team (then known as the Vancouver Stealth) were based in the Vancouver suburb of Langley, British Columbia, with home games played at the Langley Events Centre (LEC). In 2018, the team was purchased by Canucks Sports &amp; Entertainment, who relocated the team to Rogers Place in Vancouver, and announced that they would be rebranding the team as the Vancouver Warriors for the 2018-19 season.
Vancouver Whitecaps FC.
In the 2011 season, the Vancouver Whitecaps FC joined Major League Soccer. The squad plays their home games in a renovated BC Place Stadium.
Vancouver Knights.
The Vancouver Knights were one of the inaugural teams in the Global T20 Canada Twenty20 cricket tournament. The team does not have a designated home venue, playing all their matches at Brampton, Ontario. They were the inaugural champions, having won in 2018.
Vancouver Rise FC.
Vancouver Rise FC joined the Northern Super League in 2025, which is planned to be the top division of women's soccer in Canada.
PWHL Vancouver.
PWHL Vancouver joined the Professional Women's Hockey League in 2025 as the league's first expansion team.
Former teams.
The expansion Vancouver Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association were one of the anchor tenants of GM Place upon its completion in 1995, but moved to Memphis, Tennessee after just six years of operations in Vancouver. Professional basketball has been rumoured to return to Vancouver, most recently in the form of the Vancouver Dragons of the Continental Basketball Association, but has yet to establish itself. Vancouver continues to have a huge interest in acquiring a full-time National Basketball Association team and having them play their home games at Rogers Arena. Vancouver has also had professional lacrosse (Vancouver Ravens, National Lacrosse League, 2001-2004) and roller hockey (Vancouver Voodoo, Roller Hockey International, 1993-1996) teams. The Vancouver Blazers of the World Hockey Association played in the Pacific Coliseum for two seasons (1973/74 and 1974/75).
The Vancouver Royal Canadians were an association football team based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada that played in the United Soccer Association. The league was made up of teams imported almost entirely from Scotland and England. The Vancouver club was actually Sunderland A.F.C. of English Football League.
Following the 1967 season, the USA merged with the National Professional Soccer League to form the North American Soccer League with the teams from the former USA having to create their rosters from scratch. The San Francisco Golden Gate Gales franchise folded and their owners bought a controlling interest in the Royal Canadians renaming them the Vancouver Royals. Their home field was Empire Stadium.
The Vancouver Nighthalks were a semi-professional ultimate team that competed in the Major League Ultimate association. They played home games at the Thunderbird Stadium at University of British Columbia until 2016 where they had suspended play after the MLU was suspended.
The Vancouver Riptide played in the American Ultimate Disc League from 2013 to 2017 playing home games at the Burnaby Swangard Stadium. They folded after the 2017 AUDL Season due to a lack of attendance and sponsorship and are moving down to Portland for the 2020 season.
Sporting events.
The Vancouver area has also hosted multiple BC Games amateur sports events. The Slam City Jam skateboarding championship was held in Vancouver from 1994 to 2005, and was set to return in 2008. Upcoming events include the 2008 World Ultimate and Guts Championship and the 2009 World Police and Fire Games.
Annual events include the Vancouver Marathon (42K/21K), the Vancouver Sun Run (a 10 km race), Scotiabank Vancouver Half-Marathon and the Cloverdale Rodeo. The British Columbia Derby is a nine furlong horse race held at the Hastings Racecourse in the third week of September. Former annual events include the Molson Indy Vancouver, a Champ Car race held from 1990 to 2004; and the Greater Vancouver Institutional, a golf tournament held from 1996 to 2010. The Canadian Open, a golf tournament which alternates venues annually, was last held in Vancouver in 2011.
The 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics took place in Vancouver, and was organized by what was called VANOC (Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games). The 2010 Winter Olympics was the third Olympics hosted by Canada, and the first by the province of British Columbia. In the 2010 Winter Olympics, the mascots were Miga, a mythical sea bear, part orca and part kermode bear, Quatchi, a sasquatch, and Sumi, an animal guardian spirit with the wings of the Thunderbird and legs of a black bear. Miga and Quatchi were the mascots for the Olympics while Sumi was the mascot for the Paralympics.
Vancouver will host multiple matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
Other past sports events hosted in Vancouver include:
Facilities.
Major sports facilities in Vancouver are Rogers Arena (a.k.a. GM Place, Canada Hockey Place), BC Place, the Pacific Coliseum, the PNE Agrodome and Nat Bailey Stadium. BC Place is also home to the BC Sports Hall of Fame, founded in 1966. There are many other facilities throughout the city and surrounding area, including 8 Rinks in Burnaby, the Canucks' main practice venue.
The relatively mild climate of Vancouver, its extensive parkland, and close proximity to ocean, mountains, rivers and lakes provides it with a number of areas for outdoor sporting activities, both competitive and recreational. The area is a popular destination for outdoor sports and recreation, including on and off-road cycling, skateboarding, hiking, alpine and cross-country skiing, snowboarding, disc sports, golf, and water sports. The nearby North Shore Mountains are home to three ski hills, Cypress Mountain, Grouse Mountain, and Mount Seymour; each are within 20 to 30 minutes (driving time) of downtown Vancouver.
Vancouver's iconic Seawall is the longest uninterrupted waterfront path in the world at 28km, stretching from the Vancouver Convention Centre near Stanley Park, all the way to Spanish Banks Park towards the city's western edge. Its length, friendliness to pedestrians, and iconic views have made it a popular destination for Vancouver's many run clubs. These free public facilities, plus a mild climate relative to the rest of Canada, have led to a rapid spread these urban running groups, with the city now being home to several.
Media.
Vancouver's major daily newspapers, the Vancouver Sun and Vancouver Province, provide extensive coverage of local sports. CKNW was historically the main radio broadcaster of Vancouver's sports teams, but CKST, an all-sports station founded in 2001, broadcasts the Canucks, Lions, Whitecaps and Canadians . On television, most events are carried by Sportsnet Pacific, TSN, CBC, or Shaw TV.
Famous athletes.
The Vancouver area has produced a number of notable athletes, including Cam Neely (born in Comox, raised in Lower Mainland), Joe Sakic, Cliff Ronning, Milan Lucic, Mathew Barzal, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Morgan Rielly, Carey Price, Martin Jones, Brent Seabrook, Ryan Johansen and Paul Kariya (hockey); Larry Walker, Justin Morneau, Jeff Francis, and Adam Loewen (baseball); Bob Lenarduzzi, Domenic Mobilio, Emilio Reuben, Brian Budd (born in Toronto, raised in Vancouver) and Christine Sinclair (soccer); Lui Passaglia, Paris Jackson and Adam Braidwood (football); Harry Jerome, Charmaine Crooks, Percy Williams (Track &amp; Field); Steve Nash (born in South Africa, raised in Vancouver) (basketball)

Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia

The Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia (, "Assotsiatsia khudozhnikov revolutsionnoi Rossii", 1922–1928), later known as Association of Artists of the Revolution (Ассоциация художников революции, "Assotsiatsia khudozhnikov revolutsii" or AKhRR, 1928–1932) was a group of artists in the Soviet Union in 1922–1933. Diverse members of the group gained favor as the legitimate bearers of the Communist ideas into the world of art, formulating framework for the socialist realism style.
It was a large association of Soviet artists, graphic artists and sculptors, which, thanks to the support of the state, was the largest and most powerful of the creative groups of the 1920s. Founded in 1922, AKhRR was active for about 10 years before it disbanded in 1932. During this time it was the forerunner of the united Artists' Union of the USSR.
Original founding members included Alexander Grigoriev, Pavel Radimov (the last chairman of Peredvizhniki movement), Sergey Malyutin, Yevgeny Katzman, Pyotr Shukhmin and other realist painters, who already established themselves in artistic world before the Russian Revolution of 1917. The group formed within the Peredvizhniki movement, that held their last, 47th, public exhibition in 1922 and clearly placed itself in opposition to avant-garde art.
They claimed that their art style was meant to capture "revolutionary impulse of this great moment of history" without "insult[ing] the revolution in the eyes of the international proletariat."
Their first public statement as a new entity was a 1922 exhibition in Moscow; all proceeds were used for the relief of Russian famine of 1921. By 1928, the group sponsored 10 nationwide exhibitions with high publicity. Despite its revolutionary title, it successfully united artists of the "old school" like Abram Arkhipov, Aleksandr Makovsky, Nikolay Kasatkin, Konstantin Yuon and the younger ones like Sergei Gerasimov and Isaak Brodsky. In a decade, it grew up from 80 to over 300 members. Broad membership and dominance of mature artists born in the 1870s and 1880s helped in establishing AKhRR as a reliable institution, far from ultra-revolutionary rhetorics.
During the crackdown on independent art movements in 1932–1933, AKhRR served as the nucleus for the USSR Union of Artists and was liquidated after its formation.
Their artwork had influenced capitalist art in England, originally brought by British communists during and after the Spanish Civil War and eventually, after the Second World War, the fascination with Soviet aesthetics. The work had shifted advertising to portray the working class and the newly emerging middle class in their normal daily activities. With the Cold War, British critics began to be repulsed with the art as a socially inclusive medium, but its core aesthetic remained and spread globally.

François de Callières

François de Callières, sieur de Rochelay et de Gigny (; 14 May 1645, Thorigny-sur-Vire, Lower Normandy – 5 March 1717, Paris) was a member of the Académie française, a diplomat and writer, a special envoy of Louis XIV who was one of three French plenipotentiaries who signed the Peace of Ryswick in 1697; his "De la manière de négocier avec les souverains", 1716 ("On the manner of negotiating with sovereigns", translated as "The Practice of Diplomacy"), based on his experiences in negotiating the Treaty and having its origins in a letter to the Regent, Philippe, duc d'Orléans, to whom the work was dedicated, became a textbook for eighteenth-century diplomacy: Thomas Jefferson had a copy in his library at Monticello. Of this book John Kenneth Galbraith declared "One wonders why anything more needed to be said on the subject."
The companion volume, on the other hand, "De la science du monde et des connaissances utiles à la conduite de la vie" is less known, though it was quickly translated into English and was admired by Jefferson and Harold Nicolson.
Biography.
He was the son of Jacques de Callières, governor of Cherbourg and the author of "La Fortune des gens de qualité et des gentilshommes particuliers, enseignant l'art de vivre à la cour suivant les maximes de la politique et de la morale" ("The Fortune of people of quality and private gentlemen, teaching the art of living at court according to the maxims of politics and morality")
His first commission, at the age of twenty-two, was on behalf of Henri, duc de Longueville, who sent him to Poland in order to press for the election of his son Charles Paris d'Orléans, Count of Saint-Pol as King of Poland. The unlucky count was killed or drowned in a crossing of the Rhine in 1672, and the commission came to nothing.&lt;br&gt; 
Callières served discreetly in several European negotiations in the following years: Carlo Emmanuele II, Duke of Savoy employed him in attempting an alliance with France that was cut short by the Duke's death in 1675, but as the Savoyard envoy to Bavaria, Callières was involved in early stages of the negotiations that would eventually bring a Bavarian princess to the court of Louis as bride of the Grand Dauphin.
In Paris he produced several books, including in 1688 a sensible and even-handed contribution in the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, "Histoire poetique de la guerre nouvellement declarée entre les anciens et les modernes" ("Poetic history of the war recently declared between the ancients and the moderns"); it included a poem on the subject by Charles Perrault. On 23 December 1689 he was elected to the Académie française; his reception piece was a panegyric on Louis XIV. Three "galante" works followed, a volume of the latest courtly expressions and the right moves, one reporting "bons mots" and witty anecdotes of railery and one on the "bon usage" of the French spoken at Court, contrasted with middle-class expressions, for people of quality to avoid.
In 1694, when the misfortunes of war and a bad harvest in France had brought Louis round to negotiating with the League of Augsburg, Callières' Polish connections in Amsterdam alerted him that the United Provinces were ready for peace. Callières in turn alerted Colbert de Croissy, who sent him in great secrecy to Flanders with Louis de Verjus accompanying Nicolas Auguste de Harlay-Bonneuil, charged with making contact with the representatives of William III. At the end of negotiations he signed the Peace of Ryswick for France in 1697, the high point of his diplomacy. His success brought him an appointment as one of the private secretaries of the king. In his memoirs, Saint-Simon gives a good character of Callières, a gentleman with the courage to tell the truth to the King.
His great work begins with the maxim
Today the opening of his second chapter has stronger resonances than ever, two centuries after it was published:
At his death, still unmarried, he left a house in the rue Saint-Augustin filled with French, Italian and Dutch paintings, a large and well-chosen library, and the bulk of his estate to the poor of Paris.

Virginia State Route 83

State Route 83 (SR 83) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs from U.S. Route 23 Business (US 23 Business) in Pound east to the West Virginia state line in Paynesville, where the highway continues as West Virginia Route 83 (WV 83). SR 83 is the main highway of Dickenson County, where it connects the county's three towns of Clintwood, Clinchco, and Haysi. The state highway connects those towns with Pound in Wise County and Grundy in Buchanan County, and connects Grundy with McDowell County, West Virginia.
Route description.
SR 83 begins at an intersection with US 23 Business (Main Street) in the town of Pound. The state highway heads northeast as Clintwood Highway, a two-lane undivided road that crosses the Pound River and exits the town. SR 83 passes through the hamlet of Meade before reaching the Wise–Dickenson county line at Georges Fork Gap, just east of which the highway intersects SR 361, the access road to Red Onion State Prison. The state highway continues as Dickenson Highway through an intersection with SR 72 (Coeburn Road) to Clintwood, the county seat of Dickenson County. SR 83 enters the town on Main Street, turns onto Mullins Avenue, then continues on Fremont Avenue, which has a sharp curve as it ascends Baker Ridge and leaves the town. The state highway re-assumes the name Dickenson Highway and descends to and crosses the Cranes Nest River. SR 83 summits Hill Ridge at Bearpen Gap before descending to the hamlet of Fremont, where the highway crosses over CSX's Kingsport Subdivision and the McClure River and intersects SR 63 (Dante Mountain Road).
SR 83 runs concurrently with SR 63 and parallels the river and railroad to the town of Clinchco. At the north end of the town, the two state highways diverge for separate routes to Haysi. SR 63 ascends onto and follows Big Ridge to the town while SR 83 follows the Kingsport Subdivision and the McClure River to the town. On arriving in the town of Haysi, SR 83 veers east away from the river and railroad and crosses Russell Fork to intersect SR 80 (Helen Henderson Highway). The two highways head north into the center of town on Sandlick Drive, which crosses Russell Prater Creek at its confluence with Russell Fork and meets the northern end of SR 63 (Main Street). SR 83 and SR 80 turn east onto Main Street and follow Russell Prater Creek to the north end of town, where SR 80 heads north as Breaks Park Road. SR 83 continues east as Dickenson Highway along the creek into Buchanan County.
SR 83 follows Russell Prater Creek to the hamlet of Prater, then follows War Fork to its source at Lovers Gap. The state highway follows Big Lick Branch and Big Prater Creek and passes to the south of Grundy Municipal Airport on its way to Vansant. There, SR 83 crosses Levisa Fork and joins US 460 on a four-lane undivided highway through Tookland and Royal City to the town of Grundy, which the two highways enter on Riverside Drive. In the center of the Buchanan County seat, SR 83 turns east onto two-lane undivided Edgewater Drive and passes by the Buchanan County Courthouse and the Appalachian School of Law. The state highway exits Grundy on Slate Creek Road, which follows Slate Creek through the hamlet of Stacy. Near the source of Slate Creek, SR 83 veers north and ascends to the top of State Line Ridge, where the highway reaches its eastern terminus at the West Virginia state line in Paynesville. The road continues as WV 83, which parallels the state line through the West Virginia section of Paynesville before descending from the ridge to Bradshaw.

Étude Op. 10, No. 5 (Chopin)

Étude Op. 10, No. 5 in G major is a study for solo piano composed by Frédéric Chopin in 1830. It was first published in 1833 in France, Germany, and England as the fifth piece of his "Études Op. 10". The work is characterized by the rapid triplet figuration played by the right hand exclusively on black keys, except for one note, an F natural in measure 66. This melodic figuration is accompanied by the left hand with staccato chords and octaves.
Significance.
The so-called "Black Key Étude" is one of the composer's most popular. It has been a repertoire piece of pianists since Chopin's time and has inspired numerous exercises, arrangements and paraphrases. Chopin himself did not believe the study to be his most interesting one, and in a letter to his pianist friend and musical executor Julian Fontana he comments on Clara Wieck’s performance:
Hans von Bülow (1830–1894) spoke rather disdainfully of Op. 10, No. 5 as a "Damen-Salon Etüde" ("ladies' salon étude").
Structure and stylistic traits.
The piece is marked Vivace and written in 2/4 meter. Like all of Chopin's other études, this work is in ternary form ABA. The two eight-bar periods of the A section are characterized by frequent dynamic contrasts. Each reentry of the first bar, occurring every four bars, is marked by a forte, followed in the second bar by a piano restatement in a lower register. This capricious opening in the tonic is replied by an upward movement and a syncopated accompaniment in the third and fourth bar. This pattern is repeated four times. The harmonic scheme of the A section is relatively simple, featuring tonic (first two bars) versus dominant (third and fourth bars), but the consequent of the first period shifts to B major ("poco rallentando", ), while the consequent of the second one modulates to the dominant key D major.
D major is also the key of the middle section which is exactly twice as long as the A section. Its 32 bars though do not subdivide into four eight-bar periods but into sections of bars with six motivically distinct modifications of the original semiquaver triplet figure, thus offering an attractive break from the symmetry. An effective dynamic increase begins in bar 23 but does not end in a climax as the crescendo does not lead to fortissimo but eases off in diminuendos (bars 36 and 40). Harmonically the section (bars 23–41) may be interpreted as an extended and ornamented D-flat major cadence. Musicologist Hugo Leichtentritt (1874–1951) compares the left hand of bars 33–48 to horn signals. These "announce" the recapitulation of the A part which begins as a literal restatement in bar 49, seems to approach a climax and eases off with a sudden "delicatissimo pianissimo smorzando" passage, leading via a cadence to the coda. The coda consists of two periods, the last one stretched by three bars. Only the last nine bars (from bars 77 to 85) uses the black keys on both hands. The first one is a restatement of the middle section's opening transposed to the tonic G major. The consequent of the second period contains a brilliantly swooshing, widely positioned arpeggio for both hands (bars 79(83) and is pianistically attractive. Its effect is based on the accent enforced by a third at the beginning of each triplet, as well as on the tenth and eleventh stretches of the left hand and the ascending bass line covering the entire range of the keyboard. The piece ends with a rapid octave passage, and staccato, played by both hands on black keys, in a G major pentatonic scale. Some prominent performers, including Horowitz and Rosenthal, choose to perform the final octave passage "glissando".
Black keys.
Étude Op. 10, No. 5 is known as the "Black Key Étude" as its right-hand part is entirely on black keys, except for one note. Leichtentritt states that the melodic character resulting from the use of black keys is "based on the pentatonic scale to which the piece owes its strangely playful, attractively primitive tint." He presents a melodic reduction of the right hand part which, played in octaves by piccolo and flute, resembles a frolicsome Scottish jig.
The cadence to the coda (bar 66) contains the only white key, F, to be played by the right hand. But in the original editions the two thirds (G–E and D–F) are placed on the left hand staff, though editors like Jan Ekier recommend them to be (partially) played by the right hand.
Character.
Chopin gave the tempo/character indications "vivace" (lively, vivid) and (in small print) "brillante". German pianist and composer Theodor Kullak (1818–1882) says that the piece is "full of Polish elegance." American music critic James Huneker (1857–1921) calls it "graceful, delicately witty, a trifle naughty, arch and roguish and […] delightfully invented." Leichtentritt states "the piece shall glisten and sparkle, giggle and whisper, entice and flatter, have charming, occasionally coquettish, accents, bubble over with lively agility, enchant with amiable elegance". Chopin scholar Robert Collet believes that it "needs to be played with real gaiety and wit, though not without tenderness."
Technical difficulties.
In Robert Schumann’s 1836 Neue Zeitschrift für Musik article on piano études, the study is classified under the category "speed and lightness" ("Schnelligkeit und Leichtigkeit"). Huneker states "it requires smooth, velvet-tipped fingers and a supple wrist." Chopin's original indication concerning articulation of the right hand is "legato". A "sempre legatissimo" indication is given at bar 33. Nevertheless, Austrian pianist and composer Gottfried Galston (1879–1950) questions these indications and calls them "completely incomprehensible." He argues for a ""leggierissimo" with tossed fingers" ("mit geworfenen Fingern") and is backed up in this opinion by Leichtentritt. French pianist Alfred Cortot (1877–1962) modifies the "legato" indication and talks about a "brilliant and delicate legato—so-called ‘"jeu perlé"’ ["pearly" play]." He believes the main difficulty, among others, to concern "suppleness while shifting the hand in order to facilitate even action of the fingers in disjunct positions."
Preliminary exercises are given by both Galston and Cortot. Hungarian pianist and composer Rafael Joseffy (1852–1915) introduces exercises in his "instructive edition" including numerous "octave-exercises on black keys."
Paraphrases and arrangements.
In the "Studienbuch" (1922) Galston published his complete arrangement in double notes. Seven versions can be found in Leopold Godowsky’s 53 "Studies on Chopin's Études". They include a version for both hands reversed, a transposition to C major for the white keys, a "Tarantella" in A minor, a "Capriccio" "on the white and black keys," an inversion for the left hand, an inversion for the right hand and a version for the left hand alone. Besides these, there is a combination of Op. 10, No. 5 and Op. 25, No. 9 ("Butterfly"), called "Badinage" (banter), which Canadian pianist Marc-André Hamelin calls a "brilliant "jeu d’esprit"" and a "fantastically clever feat of combinatorial wizardry." German pianist Friedrich Wührer's version for both hands reversed resembles Godowsky's first one.

Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor

Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) is involved in the cleavage of the 3' signaling region from a newly synthesized pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) molecule in the process of gene transcription. In eukaryotes, messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNA) are transcribed in the nucleus from DNA by the enzyme, RNA polymerase II. The pre-mRNA must undergo post-transcriptional modifications, forming mature RNA (mRNA), before they can be transported into the cytoplasm for translation into proteins. The post-transcriptional modifications are: the addition of a 5' m7G cap, splicing of intronic sequences, and 3' cleavage and polyadenylation.
According to Schönemann et al., "CPSF recognizes the polyadenylation signal (PAS), providing sequence specificity in pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation, and catalyzes pre-mRNA cleavage." It is required to induce RNA polymerase pausing once it recognizes a functional PAS. It is the first protein to bind to the signaling region near the cleavage site of the pre-mRNA, to which the poly(A) tail will be added by polynucleotide adenylyltransferase. The 10-30 nucleotide upstream signaling region of the cleavage site, polyadenylation signal (PAS), has the canonical nucleotide sequence AAUAAA, which is highly conserved across the vast majority of pre-mRNAs. The AAUAAA region is usually defined by a cytosine/adenine (CA) dinucleotide, which is the preferred sequence, that is 5' to the site of the endonucleolytic cleavage. A second downstream signaling region, located approximately 40 nucleotides downstream from the cleavage site on the portion of the pre-mRNA that is cleaved before polyadenylation, consists of a U/GU-rich region required for efficient processing. This downstream fragment is degraded. The mature RNA are transported into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into proteins.
Protein Structure &amp; Interactions.
In mammals, CPSF is a protein complex, consisting of six subunits: CPSF-160 (CPSF1), CPSF-100 (CPSF2), CPSF-73 (CPSF3), and CPSF-30 (CPSF4) kDa subunits, WDR33 and Fip1 (FIP1L1).
The subunits form two components: mammalian polyadenylation specificity factors (mPSF) and mammalian cleavage factor (mCF). The mPSF is made up of CPSF-160, WDR33, CPSF-30, and Fip1. It is necessary for PAS recognition and polyadenylation. The mCF is made up of CPSF-73, CPSF-100, and symplekin. It catalyzes the cleavage reaction by recognizing the histone mRNA 3' processing site.
CPSF-73 is a zinc-dependent hydrolase which cleaves the mRNA precursor between a CA dinucleotide just downstream the polyadenylation signal sequence AAUAAA.
CPSF-100 contributes to the endonuclease activity of CPSF-73.
CPSF-160 (160 kDa) is the largest subunit of CPSF and directly binds to the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal. 160 kDa has three β-propeller domains and a C-terminal domain.
CPSF-30 (30 kDa) has five Cys-Cys-Cys-His (CCCH) zinc-finger motifs near the N terminus and a CCCH zinc knuckle at the C terminus. Two isoforms of CPSF-30 exist and can be found in CPSF complexes. The RNA binding activity of CPSF-30 is mediated by its zinc-fingers 2 and 3. WD repeat domain 33 (146 kDa) has a WD40 domain near the N terminus. The WD40 domain interacts with RNA. WDR33 and CPSF-30 recognize the polyadenylation signal (PAS) in pre-mRNA, which aids in defining the position of RNA cleavage. CPSF-30 recognizes the AU-rich hexamer region by a cooperative, metal-dependent binding mechanism.
Although CPSF-160 is the largest subunit of CPSF, a study conducted by Schönemann et al., debate that WDR33 is responsible for recognizing the PAS and not CPSF-160 as previously believed. The study concluded that the reason that CPSF-160 was believed to be responsible for recognizing the PAS was due to the fact that the WDR33 subunit had not been discovered at the time of the claim.
Fip1 binds to U-rich RNAs by its arginine-rich C-terminus. It binds to RNA sequences upstream of the AAUAAA hexamer region in vitro. Fip1 and CPSF-160 recruit poly(A) polymerase (PAP) to the 3' processing site. PAP is stimulated by Poly(A) binding protein nuclear one to add the poly(A) tail, a non-templated adenosine residues, at the cleavage site.
Only CPSF-160, CPSF-30, Fip1, and WDR33 are necessary and sufficient to form an active CPSF subcomplex in AAUAAA-dependent polyadenylation. CPSF-73 and CPSF-100 are disposable.
CPSF recruits proteins to the 3' region. Identified proteins that are coordinated by CPSF activity include: cleavage stimulatory factor and the two poorly understood cleavage factors. The binding of the polynucleotide adenylyltransferase responsible for actually synthesizing the tail is a necessary prerequisite for cleavage, thus ensuring that cleavage and polyadenylation are tightly coupled processes.
Alternative Polyadenylation (APA).
Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a regulatory mechanism that forms multiple 3' end on mRNA.
APA isoforms from the same gene can encode different proteins and/or contain different 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Deregulation of APA has been associated with a number of human diseases. Since longer UTRs have more binding sites for microRNAs and/or RNA-binding proteins in comparison to shorter UTRs, APA require different stability, translation efficiency, and/or intracellular localization. 
Mammalian PASs have a number of key "cis" elements.
PAS sequences are variable, and many PASs lack one or more "cis" elements. PAS recognition is accomplished by protein-RNA interactions.
CPSF synergistically binds to the AAUAAA hexamer and CstF synergistically binds to the downstream element (DSE). The CFI complex binds to the UGUA motifs. CPSF, CstF, and CFI bind directly to RNA. They also recruit other proteins such as CFII, symplekin, and the poly(A) polymerase (PAP) to assemble the mRNA 3' processing complex, also known as the cleavage and polyadenylation complex. The assembly of these factors are facilitated by the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) large subunit. The CTD provides a landing pad for mRNA processing factors.
Other Protein Complexes in the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Complex.
Symplekin (SYMPK) is a scaffolding protein that mediates the interaction between CPSF and CstF.
In mammalian CPSF, both cleavage factor I (CFIm) and cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) are required for cleavage and polyadenylation whereas cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) is only essential for the cleavage step. CPSF and CstF travel along with RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) during nascent gene transcription in search of the PAS.
Cleavage factor I (CFIm) is made of 25 (CPSF5), 59 (CPSF7), and 68 (CPSF6) kDa proteins. Cleavage factor II (CFIIm) is made of Pcf11, Clp1, and cleavage stimulation factor (CstF). CFIIm binds to the RNAP II C-terminal domain and other CpA factors.
Cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) has three subunits: CstF77 (CstF3), CstF50 (CstF1), and CstF64 (CstF2 and CstF2T). CstF recognizes the PAS that is 20 nucleotides downstream the signaling region of the cleavage site, which is a GU-rich sequence motif followed by U-rich sequences. CstF contributes to the selection of the cleavage site, as well as alternative polyadenylation.
Coupled Processes.
Coupling of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription can influence processing reactions in three ways.

Dog whipper

A dog whipper was a church official charged with removing unruly dogs from church grounds during services. They were most prominent in areas of England and continental Europe between the 16th and 19th centuries.
Those employed for the position were given a three-foot-long whip and a pair of dog tongs with which to remove the animals. They were given the task of keeping stray animals away from the church and preventing communion bread and priests from being assaulted. The whip was utilized both for enforcement and as a deterrent while the tongs enabled the whipper to clasp a problematic animal from a safe distance.
It was not uncommon for household dogs to accompany—or at least follow—their owners to church services at this time. If at any point they became loud, fought with other animals, attacked congregation members, or were otherwise disruptive, it was the job of the dog whipper to remove them from the church as well as to allow the service to continue in peace.
Dog whippers were generally paid for their services, and records of payments to the local dog whipper exist in old parish account books in many English churches. In some areas a portion of village land was made available for the use of the dog whipper; the small park named 'Dog Acre' in Birchington-on-Sea is the remnant of such a grant.
Some villages employed dog whippers in a more general capacity, dealing with stray and disruptive dogs throughout the village. In this sense dog whippers were precursors of modern animal control officers, much like church 'bang beggars' were to today's police officer. In addition, churches that found their coffers lacking had the option of hiring out their services or giving their staff other tasks to complete. The role was similar to the 'Sluggard waker' that entailed poking or hitting drowsy members of the congregation on the head with a long, outfitted pole.
Dog whippers became less common from the late 18th century onwards, presumably because animals were increasingly unwelcome at church services. One of the last recorded dog whippers to perform the original function was one John Pickard, who was appointed to Exeter Cathedral in 1856. A small room in Exeter Cathedral is still known as the Dog Whipper's Room. Exeter still has a dog whipper, now a purely ceremonial role, for processions and other significant occasions. 
A dog whipper's whip survives in St. Anne's Church, Baslow, Derbyshire, and a dog whipper's pew is preserved in St. Margaret's Church in Wrenbury, Cheshire. A notable carving of a dog whipper removing a dog with his whip can be seen in the Great Church of St. Bavo in Haarlem.
With the advent of animal shelters, this job became largely obsolete.

 was a Japanese avant-garde jazz and jazz fusion trumpeter.
Career.
Kondo was born in Ehime Prefecture. He attended Kyoto university in 1967, and became close friends with percussionist Tsuchitori Toshiyuki. In 1972 the pair left university, and Toshiyuki went on to work with Peter Brook, while Kondo joined Yosuke Yamashita. In 1978 he moved to New York, and began performing with Bill Laswell, John Zorn, Fred Frith, and Eraldo Bernocchi. A year later he released his first recording, toured Europe with Eugene Chadbourne, and collaborated with European musicians such as Peter Brötzmann. Returning to Japan, he worked with Ryuichi Sakamoto, Kazumi Watanabe, and Herbie Hancock. In the mid-1980s he began focusing on his own career, blending his avant-garde origins with electronic music. In the 1990s he was part of the collective called Die Like a Dog whose first album "Fragments Of Music, Life And Death of Albert Ayler" was released in 1994. In 2002, he worked on an international peace festival in Hiroshima after being approached by the Dalai Lama about organizing one. He was a former member of Praxis. Kondo cooperated with Bill Laswell to make the album "Inamorata" in 2007.
He founded the band Kondo IMA in 1984. Kondo IMA achieved commercial success but moved to Amsterdam to be alone and to start "Blow the Earth" in 1993. They started "Blow the Earth in Japan" in the summer of 2007 and ended in the autumn of 2011. The film "Blow the Earth in Japan" is his first experience as a film director.

Grevillea alpina

Grevillea alpina is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It has several common names, including mountain grevillea, alpine grevillea, and cat's claws. It is endemic to Australia. It is not limited to alpine environments, and in fact is less common at high elevation than low. The species is variable in appearance, with five general forms described: small-flowered, Grampians, Northern Victorian, Goldfields, and Southern Hills forms. It is found in dry forests and woodlands across Victoria and into southern New South Wales.
Some forms of the plant are low to the ground, and some become a spreading shrub. The flowers come in many colours, from white to green to shades of red and pink, or a pattern of several colours. The curled flowers are in length. It is attractive to nectar-feeding insects and birds.
Description.
There is considerable variation in the form, leaves and flowers of the species. Plants are between in height. The leaves may be linear, oblong or elliptic and are generally between long and wide. Both surfaces of leaves may or may not have hairs. The leaf edges may be curved backwards or revolute.
Flower colour is one of the most variable characteristics. The main colour of the perianth may be red, orange or pink or more rarely yellow or cream. There is often a transition of colour along the length of the perianth leading to commonly seen red-yellow or red-cream combinations. The main months of flowering are from August to December in the species' native range. The flowers are followed by hairy, leathery, ovoid fruits (follicles) that are between long. These split open, releasing winged seeds.
Taxonomy.
The species was first formally described in 1838 by English botanist John Lindley in "Three expeditions into the interior of Australia". This description was based on plant material collected from Mount William in the Grampians during Thomas Mitchell's expedition in 1836.
In the "Flora of Australia" (1999), the species was positioned within the genus "Grevillea" by means of a hierarchical tree as follows:
"Grevillea" (genus)
Distribution.
"Grevillea alpina" is widespread in Victoria extending from Melbourne northwards into New South Wales through Albury and as far north as Canberra where it is found on Black Mountain. Its westernmost extent is found in the Grampians in Victoria. It occurs in woodland, heathland and mallee.
In "The Grevillea Book" published in 1995, the authors Peter Olde and Neil Marriott identified five informal forms:
Naturally occurring hybrids have been recorded with "G. lavandulacea"."G. dryophylla" and "G. obtecta". In New Zealand, hybrids with "Grevillea rosmarinifolia" have become naturalised.
Ecology.
Honeyeaters are believed to be the major pollinators. Honey bees have been observed feeding on the nectar, but are able to do so without touching the pollen presenter.
Conservation status.
"Grevillea alpina" is listed as "Least Concern" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It has a wide distribution, its population is assumed to be stable and there are no major threats to this species.
Cultivation.
The species was first introduced to cultivation in England in 1856 and by 1858 was in cultivation at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne. Though widely grown, it has a reputation for being short lived. This problem, which is accentuated in humid climates with summer rainfall, has been addressed by grafting on various rootstocks. "G. alpina" grows best in dry environments and does not tolerate excess moisture well. Regular pruning from a young age will encourage denser growth and reduce woodiness.
Plants are readily propagated from pre-treated seed, though seed sourced from gardens often leads to hybrid progeny. The species hybridises readily with "Grevillea rosmarinifolia", "Grevillea juniperina" and "Grevillea lavandulacea". The use of cuttings is the preferred method of propagation for assuring that particular forms and cultivars are true to type.
In 2003, it was reported that the fungal disease "Phytophthora palmivora" had been detected in plant nurseries in Sicily, leading to root rot and death of potted "Grevillea" cultivars. Of these plants of "Grevillea alpina" were the most severely affected.
Cultivars.
A large number of hybrid cultivars and selected forms have been introduced to horticulture including:
Numerous naturally occurring forms have been named after the locality from which they originate including Albury, Axedale, Bendigo, Black Mountain, Castlemaine, Chiltern, Grampians, Greta West, Kinglake, Lerderderg Gorge, Morrl Morrl, Mt Dandenong, Mt Ida, Mt Pleasant, Mt Slide, Mt Zero, Murphys Hill, One Tree Hill, Porcupine Ridge, Pyalong, Reef Hills, Rushworth, Seymour, South Mandurang, St Arnaud, Strathbogies, Tallarook, Tamminack Gap, Tawonga Gap, Tooborac, Warby Range, Whorouly and Wombat State Forest.

The Pixilated Peeress

The Pixilated Peeress is a fantasy novel by American writers L. Sprague de Camp and Catherine Crook de Camp. It is the second book in their sequence of two Neo-Napolitanian novels, following "The Incorporated Knight". It was first published in hardcover by Del Rey Books in August 1991, and in paperback by the same publisher in September 1992. An E-book edition was published by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.
Plot summary.
Soldier and aspiring scholar Thorolf Zigramson of Rhaetia is out fishing when he encounters the proverbial damsel in distress in the form of Yvette, fugitive Countess of Grintz from the neighboring kingdom of Carinthia. She is fleeing the forces of the avaricious Duke of Landai, occupier of her fief and aspirant to her hand. But Thorolf gains a burden rather than gratitude by rescuing the self-important peeress from her pursuers.
To hide the countess from her enemy Thorolf takes her to the Rhaetian capital of Zurshnitt, where his enchanter friend Doctor Bardi undertakes to magically disguise her features. The spell goes badly awry, mistakenly turning Yvette into an octopus instead. In order to reverse the spell Thorolf must resort to the more powerful wizard Doctor Orlandus, a shady cult-leader. But matters go from bad to worse; while Orlandus cures Yvette all right, he also makes her one of his spirit-controlled slaves to advance his scheme of taking over the government of Rhaetia. On top of that, his henchmen murder Doctor Bardi, leaving Thorolf under suspicion of perpetrating the crime.
The soldier flees and seeks sanctuary with the trolls, some of whom he has befriended in the past, only to find them more inclined to eat than succor him; he has managed to put himself among the "wrong" trolls, arch-foes of the band he knows. To gain their favor and protection he promises to rid his captors of a local dragon. Accordingly, he directs them in a successful effort to capture the beast and sell it to the director of Zurshnitt's zoo. But to bind him to them, his new allies insist he marry one of their number. The troll lass finds the hapless warrior as unattractive as he does her, and they settle by mutual agreement into a union in name only.
Parlaying his membership in the troll band into a bid to reverse his fortune, Thorolf uses their secret tunnels to spy on Orlandus and ultimately to kill the wizard and rescue Yvette. The two are pursued by the late cultist's followers and trapped between them and the forces of Yvette's lordly suitor, which contend over who will get them. The situation resolved only after the duke kills the new cult leader in single combat and is then in turn bested and taken hostage by Thorolf. Meanwhile, the latter's troll wife complication is resolved when the beauty in question elopes with her true love, a stalwart troll lad.
Sharing a mutual attraction, Thorolf and Yvette have during their adventures alternately quarreled and reconciled, coming close at times to a physical relationship only to be thwarted by circumstances. With the downfall of the countess's enemies, all chance of this is lost; able to act the aristocrat again, Yvette throws herself with a will into raising an army to reconquer Grintz. Thorolf, as a commoner, has no place in this picture.
Bowing to the inevitable, Thorolf leaves and enlists as a mercenary in the wars between the contending city-states of Tyrrhennia. Finding a more amenable bride there, he eventually returns to Zurshnitt to find Yvette much reduced in circumstances. Her bid to regain her county has miscarried, and she has had to settle for becoming the wife of a commoner after all – Thorolf's old friend the zoo director. But Yvette chafes in the role. Now seeing her former rescuer in a different light, she proposes they abandon their spouses and run off together. Thorolf, satisfied with his new bride and finally close to achieving his longed-for academic position, declines.
Setting.
"The Pixilated Peeress" and its predecessor "The Incorporated Knight" are both set in the medieval era of an alternate world sharing the geography of our own, but in which a "Napolitanian" (Neapolitan) empire filled the role of Rome and no universal religion like Christianity ever arose, leaving its nations split among competing pagan sects. The present-day of the novels corresponds to the High Middle Ages, in which the preeminent power is the German-based Neo-Napolitanian Empire, an analog to the historical Holy Roman Empire. The Rhaetia of which Thorolf is a citizen roughly corresponds to our world's Switzerland, and neighboring Tyrrhenia to northern Italy. In keeping with the character of de Camp's fantasy world as a cognate of our own, its place names tend to echo those of the real world. There was an actual Rhaetia in the region de Camp places his that was a province of the Roman Empire and an actual Carinthia in Austria, while Tyrrhenia is an ancient name of Tuscany, and gave its name to the neighboring Tyrrhenian Sea. De Camp's Zurshnitt corresponds to Zürich, and his Landai may be intended to represent the actual Landau in southwestern Germany. His trolls are envisioned as remnant Neanderthals, currently inhabiting marginal high-altitude regions but represented as a formerly widespread aboriginal race displaced by humanity.
Reception.
Reviews were favorable. Sharon Miller, writing for United Press International, states that the book demonstrates de Camp "has come as close as anyone to perfecting" what she calls "light-hearted fantasy." Further, "[t]his being a proper fantasy, you know [the protagonists] are going to quarrel constantly and fall in love. But this also is the de Camps, so you'd be wise not to count on anything else except being thoroughly entertained."
"Kirkus Reviews" characterized the book as the authors' "latest lightweight sword-and-sorcery adventure," noting that "[t]here are no pretensions here: the de Camps deliver what they promise and no more--a lighthearted adventure laced with some outright comedy and a dash of bawdiness. Though the tale often follows the track of the cliché, the unassuming style and verve of the telling carry it through; and the authors veer from the expected course often enough to keep the pages turning. Pure prose junk-food, but a pleasant romp."
"Publishers Weekly" notes that "[w]ith its direct, matter-of-fact tone, this wry and delightful fantasy punctures the pretensions to which the genre is often prone."
In "The Booklist" Roland Green calls the book "good fun," and cites its hero as "a fine specimen of the de Camp hero, able to outthink as well as outfight his enemies." Sally Estes calls it "a lightweight but fun fantasy romp" and "a hilarous adventure with a surprise ending."
The book was also reviewed by Don D'Ammassa in "Science Fiction Chronicle" no. 142 August 1991, Carolyn Cushman in "Locus" no. 367, August 1991, Jean-Marc Lofficier in "Starlog" no. 173, December 1991, Baird Searles in "Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine", March 1992, Darrell Schweitzer in "Aboriginal Science Fiction", Fall 1992, and Steven Sawicki in "Quantum", Summer/Fall 1992.
Relation to other works.
The main plot device of bickering male and female protagonists not destined for a happy ending together is featured in several late de Camp novels, notably "The Prisoner of Zhamanak" (1982), "The Bones of Zora" (1983), and "The Incorporated Knight" (1987). Thorolf's method of dragon hunting echoes that employed in "King Fusinian the Fox and the Teeth of Grimnor," an inset tale in de Camp's "The Goblin Tower" (1968). The plot feature of the protagonist gaining sanctuary with a nonhuman race, facing an unwelcome marriage, and being saved by the reluctant bride's betrothed is reused from de Camp's much earlier short story "The Blue Giraffe" (1939).

Swede Halbrook

Harvey Wade "Swede" Halbrook (January 30, 1933 – April 5, 1988) was an American National Basketball Association (NBA) player from 1960 to 1962. He played in college for Oregon State University, and at 7 ft 3 in (2.21 m), was at the time the tallest player to ever play college and professional basketball.
High school career.
Swede Halbrook played high school basketball at Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon where he also starred in track as a high jumper and hurdler. Lincoln won the state tournament in Halbrook's senior year. In one tournament game, he scored 50 points and had 34 rebounds.
College career.
When Halbrook joined the Oregon State Beavers, "Life magazine" declared him the "World's Tallest Basketball Player" in their January 18, 1954, issue. Under head coach Slats Gill, he instantly turned the team into a national title contender, earning All-American status in 1955 and All-Pacific Coast Conference first team and All-Northern Division first-team honors in 1954 and 1955, the only two seasons he played. As of 2006, he still holds the top three spots on Oregon State's single-game rebound records, his top performance of 36 being tied for 15th in NCAA history. He also holds the Oregon State record for free throws attempted at 28.
Professional career.
Halbrook joined the Wichita Vickers of the National Industrial Basketball League in 1955. He played six seasons and led the team to the national AAU title in 1959. The next year, he was selected to play for the Syracuse Nationals.
Halbrook played in 79 games in the 1960–61 season, which saw the third-place Nationals earn an NBA playoffs berth. The rookie was a major factor in several games, none moreso than in the Eastern Conference semi-finals, where the Nats swept a hard-fought, three-game series against sophomore sensation Wilt Chamberlain and the Philadelphia Warriors. Halbook was particularly effective in the first two games. In the series opener, he contributed 15 points and 15 rebounds in a 115–108 triumph at home. The big guy followed with 12 points and a dozen rebounds in a 115-114 road victory. Meanwhile, the center tandem of Halbrook and veteran Johnny Kerr held Chamberlain below his regular-season averages at the other end. As Syracuse coach Alex Hannum told the Oregonian, "Wilt was really concerned with Swede ... Wilt never had to look anyone in the eye and he would get more involved in trying to outplay Swede than he would in trying to win the game."
The following season, Halbrook played in 64 games for the Nationals, that season marking the end of his professional career. He remained the tallest player in NBA history until the 1982 draft brought Mark Eaton and Chuck Nevitt into the league.
Personal life.
Off-court issues cut short both Halbrook's college and professional careers. He would reportedly go missing for days, sometimes weeks at a time without explanation. Oregon State coach Gill was forced to cut him from the team after only two seasons for skipping class so often. Nationals coach Hannum is quoted to have said that "He could have had a worthwhile career if he had taken care of himself. During his second season, he disappeared for a week and we sent the police out to look for him. But they couldn’t find a 7-footer! He came back on his own but he never would tell me where he had been."
Swede moved back to Portland, Oregon after being released from the Nationals and worked at a variety of odd jobs for the remainder of his life. In later life, he worked as a circus clown and was given the title of the "World's Tallest Clown". He died of a heart attack on April 5, 1988, on a Portland city bus.

Cleavage factor

Cleavage factors are two closely associated protein complexes involved in the cleavage of the 3' untranslated region of a newly synthesized pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule in the process of gene transcription. The cleavage is the first step in adding a polyadenine tail to the pre-mRNA, which is one of the necessary post-transcriptional modifications necessary for producing a mature mRNA molecule.
In mammals, the two cleavage factors are known as CFIm and CFIIm. The proteins that constitute these complexes are recruited to the cleavage site by cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor and cleavage stimulatory factor, and form a larger complex that also includes polyadenine polymerase, which performs the polyadenylation reaction.
The CFIm complex.
Involved in the earliest step for the formation of the active cleavage complex, the CFIm complex is formed by three proteins of 25, 59 and 68 kDa, respectively:
CFIm25 and CFIm68 are sufficient for the activity of the complex, proving the expected redundancy of CFIm68 and CFIm59, which share great sequence similarity.
The CFIIm complex.
The CFIIm complex is responsible for transcription termination and triggering the disassembly of the elongation complex. It is composed of only two proteins:

Anasazi flute

The Anasazi flute, named for the Anasazi people, is a prehistoric end-blown flute replicated today from findings at a massive cave in Prayer Rock Valley in Arizona, United States by an archaeological expedition led by Earl H. Morris in 1931. The team excavated 15 caves; the largest among them had 16 dwellings and many artifacts, including several wooden flutes, which gave the site its name, the Broken Flute Cave. 
The flutes found in the cave were dated between 620 and 670 AD. They were all made of box elder, have six finger holes and are end-blown. It is similar in many respects to a Hopi flute, which has only five finger holes.
A detailed analysis using radiocarbon dating techniques was published in 2007. The analysis included one item from a burial pit in the Broken Flute Cave. The dating placed the artifact in the range 599–769 AD.
The Anasazi flute has in recent years been reproduced and restored to the catalog of world flutes. While difficult to play in many respects, it has a rich, warm voice that can potentially span over three octaves.

Banksia micrantha

Banksia micrantha is a species of small shrub that is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a spreading bush with sharply-pointed linear leaves, pale yellow flower spikes and up to twenty-five follicles surrounded by the remains of the flowers. It was first formally described by Alex George in 1981.
Description.
"Banksia micrantha" grows as a spreading, bushy shrub up to high and wide and forms a lignotuber. Its branches are often horizontal and underground at first. It has hairy stems and sharply-pointed, linear leaves long and wide on a petiole long. The edges of the leaves are tightly rolled under. The flowers are pale yellow and arranged in a spike long with hairy involucral bracts long at the base of the head. The perianth is long and the pistil hooked and long. Up to twenty-five egg-shaped to elliptic follicles long high and wide form in each head, surrounded by the remains of the flowers.
Taxonomy.
"Banksia micrantha" had been recorded since 1938, but considered part of a broad "B. sphaerocarpa" complex, until officially described in 1981 by Alex George in his monograph "The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)". The specific epithet ("micrantha") is from ancient Greek words meaning "small" and "flower".
George placed "B. micrantha" in "Banksia" subgenus "Banksia" because of its characteristic "Banksia" flower spike, section "Oncostylis" because its flowers have hooked styles, and series "Abietinae" because of its roughly spherical flower spike. Its closest relative is said to "B. sphaerocarpa" (fox banksia).
A 1996 cladistic analysis of "Banksia" by Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges confirmed "B. micrantha"'s placement in series "Abietinae" alongside "B. sphaerocarpa", finding "B. micrantha" to be more closely related to "B. sphaerocarpa" var. "sphaerocarpa" and "B. sphaerocarpa" var. "caesia" than is "B. sphaerocarpa" var. "dolichostyla". As a result, this last variety was upgraded to species rank as "B. dolichostyla", and the four taxa were placed with "B. grossa" in a new subseries of "Abietinae", "Banksia subser. Sphaerocarpae". However, these changes were not accepted by Alex George in his authoritative 1999 contribution to the "Flora of Australia" series.
Distribution and habitat.
"Banksia micrantha" grows in kwongan and occurs amongst heath on sand or sand over laterite on the gentle slopes of lateritic hills between Eneabba and Cervantes.
Ecology.
This banksia is fire tolerant, resprouting from its lignotuber but the follicles also remain closed until after a bushfire, when the follicles open to release the seed.
Conservation status.
"Banksia micrantha" is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.
Use in horticulture.
Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 21 days to germinate.

James Aronson (1915–1988) was an American journalist. He founded the "National Guardian". He was a graduate of Harvard College and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
Career.
Aronson, known as "Jim" to his friends, worked at several publications prior to founding the "National Guardian". He worked on the staffs of the "Boston Evening Transcript", the "New York Herald Tribune", the "New York Post" and "The New York Times" from 1946 to 1948.

BnF Museum

The BnF Museum or Museum of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, formerly known as the Cabinet des Médailles (), is a significant art and history museum in Paris. It displays collections of the "Département des Monnaies, Médailles et Antiques de la Bibliothèque nationale de France" as well as manuscripts and books from the Library's collections. The BnF Museum is located in the Richelieu site, the former main building of the library bordering rue de Richelieu.
Overview.
The Cabinet des Médailles is a museum containing internationally important collections of coins, engraved gems, and antiquities, with its distant origins in the treasuries of the French kings of the Middle Ages. The disruptions of the Wars of Religion inspired Charles IX (1560–1574) to create the position of a ("Special guardian of the King's medals and antiques"). Thus the collection, which has been augmented and never again dispersed – unlike the first royal library, assembled at the Palais du Louvre by Charles V, which contained 973 volumes when it was inventoried in 1373, but was dispersed during the following century. It passed from being the personal collection of the king to becoming a national property – a – as the royal collection was declared during the Revolution. A stage in this aspect of its development was the bequest of the collection of pioneering archeologist comte de Caylus, who knew that in this fashion his antiquities would be most accessible to scholars. Other collectors followed suit: when the duc de Luynes gave his collection of Greek coins to the "Cabinet Impérial" in 1862, it was a national collection rather than simply an Imperial one he was enriching. The State also added to the treasury contained in the Cabinet des Médailles: a notable addition, in 1846, was the early sixth century gold Treasure of Gourdon.
The cabinet, in the sense of a small private room for the conservation and display of intimate works of art and for private conversations, rather than a piece of furniture, took a stable shape under Henry IV, who nominated the connoisseur Rascas de Bagarris "garde particulier des médailles et antiques du roi", the "particular guardian of the medals and antiquities of the King".
Among the antiquarians and scholars who have had the charge of the , one of the most outstanding was Théophile Marion Dumersan, who began working there in 1795 at the age of sixteen, protected the collection from dispersal by the allies after Napoleon's defeat, and published at his own expense a history of the collection and description, as newly rearranged according to historical principles, in 1838
Earlier printed catalogues of parts of the collection had been published. Pierre-Jean Mariette, urged by the comte de Caylus, published a selection of the royal carved hardstones as volume II of his.
Louis XIV of France, an acquisitive connoisseur, brought together the cabinet of curiosities of his uncle Gaston d'Orléans and acquired that of Hippolyte de Béthune, the nephew of Henri IV's minister Sully. In order to keep the collections closer at hand, he removed them from the old royal library in Paris to the Palace of Versailles.
When Louis' great-grandson Louis XV had attained majority, the "Cabinet" was returned to Paris in 1724, to take up its present space in the royal library that was designed under the direction of Jules-Robert de Cotte, the son of Mansart's successor at the Bâtiments du Roi. In the "Cabinet des Médailles", the medal-cabinet delivered in 1739 by the "ébéniste du roi" Antoine Gaudreau figures among the greatest pieces of French furniture. Other medal cabinets were delivered for Louis XIV by André-Charles Boulle. The "cabinet" also still houses its paintings by Boucher, Natoire and Van Loo.
Following the French Revolution, a number of precious objects previously kept at the Treasury of Saint-Denis joined the collection of the Cabinet. 
The Cabinet des Médailles is considered the oldest museum in France. It is located in the former building of the Bibliothèque Nationale, 58 rue Richelieu, Paris I, and can be visited for free every afternoon (13:00–17:00), seven days a week.

Haud

The Haud (also Hawd) (, ), formerly known as the Hawd Reserve Area, is a plateau situated in the Horn of Africa consisting of thorn-bush and grasslands. The region includes the southern part of Somaliland as well as the northern and eastern parts of the Somali Region of Ethiopia. Haud is a historic region as well as an important grazing area and has multiple times been referenced in countless notorious poems. The region is also known for its red soil, caused by the soil's iron richness. The Haud covers an estimated area of about 119,000 square km (or 46,000 square miles), more than nine-tenths the size of England, or roughly the size of North Korea.
History.
The Haud region, a vast plateau in the Horn of Africa, has historically been a significant area inhabited primarily by Somali pastoralist clans. It is part of the larger Somali ethnic territories.
Ancient and Medieval Periods.
The Haud is believed by some scholars to have been part of the ancient Land of Punt, a kingdom renowned to the ancient Egyptians for its wealth in incense, gold, and exotic animals. The exact geographical boundaries of Punt remain debated, but many suggest it encompassed parts of the Horn of Africa, including the Haud.
During the medieval era, the Haud region came under the influence of the Ifat Sultanate, an Islamic kingdom which flourished from the late 13th to the early 15th centuries.Ifat controlled parts of what are now eastern Ethiopia and Djibouti. After Ifat’s decline, the Adal Sultanate rose to prominence, continuing to assert Islamic cultural and political influence in the region.
The Isaaq Sultanate.
By the 18th century, the Haud was central to the Isaaq Sultanate, governed by the Rer Guled Eidagale branch of the Garhajis clan within the Isaaq clan-family. The sultanate’s authority extended across parts of present-day Somaliland and Ethiopia, with capitals at Toon and later Hargeisa. The Isaaq Sultanate played an essential role in the political, social, and economic life of the region until the late 19th century.
Colonial Era and the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty.
European colonial expansion dramatically reshaped the Haud. The 1941 Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty saw Britain cede the Haud and Ogaden regions to Ethiopian sovereignty.This transfer was contentious since the Haud was predominantly inhabited by ethnic Somalis, many of whom had been under British protection as part of British Somaliland. The treaty ignored Somali claims to the land, fueling long-standing resentment.
Despite the formal cession, Britain continued to administer the Haud as part of its Somaliland Protectorate for 13 years, effectively acting as a buffer between Ethiopian authorities and Somali pastoralists. The 1954 Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement reaffirmed Ethiopian sovereignty, intensifying tensions as Ethiopia sought to assert stronger control over the region.
Post-Colonial Period and the Ogaden War.
Following Somali independence in 1960, the Somali government adopted irredentist ambitions to unify all Somali-inhabited territories, including the Haud and Ogaden, into a Greater Somalia. These claims heightened tensions with Ethiopia.
In 1977, Somalia invaded the Ogaden and Haud regions, igniting the Ogaden War (1977–1978). Somali forces initially occupied much of the Haud, including key towns like Jigjiga.However, Ethiopia, with Soviet and Cuban support, repelled the invasion. The war entrenched animosities and complicated the Haud’s political future.
Background and Causes of the Afraad Rebellion.
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Haud became a site of intense conflict and abuses against the Isaaq clan. The Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF), primarily composed of Ogaden fighters and backed by the Somali National Army (SNA), waged armed struggle against Ethiopia.However, some WSLF and SNA units perpetrated massacres, looting, rape, and destruction targeting Isaaq civilians in the Haud.
The Isaaq repeatedly appealed to both the WSLF and the Somali government to end these atrocities, but their pleas were ignored. The SNA's support of the WSLF further enabled continued abuses, deepening grievances.
In response, Isaaq officers and fighters from the WSLF’s Fourth Brigade—known locally as the Afraad—rebelled in 1978. Rejecting WSLF leadership’s complicity, they launched an independent insurgency focused on defending Isaaq territories.Led by figures such as Mohamed Farah Dalmar Yusuf, Afraad engaged in guerrilla warfare across Gobyar, Dhaberooble, Wajaale, and Gaashaamo.
By 1982, Afraad had gained broad Isaaq support, expelled many WSLF fighters from the Haud, and formally joined the Somali National Movement (SNM), the main resistance group for Somaliland autonomy.
Culmination into the Somaliland War.
The Afraad rebellion was a catalyst for wider Isaaq opposition to the Somali government. Continued government repression and refusal to protect Isaaq civilians led to the escalation of the Somaliland War throughout the 1980s. The conflict saw harsh counterinsurgency tactics, including aerial bombings and mass atrocities by the Somali regime. The war ultimately resulted in the collapse of the Siad Barre regime and Somaliland’s declaration of independence in 1991.
The 2024 Dacawaley Conflict and Liyu Police Involvement.
In December 2024, the Haud region became a focal point of the Dacawaley conflict, centered in the pastoralist settlement of Dacawaley in Ethiopia’s Somali Regional State.The conflict involved inter-clan clashes primarily between the Isaaq and Ogaden clans over grazing lands and resources.
The situation escalated when the Liyu Police, an Ethiopian regional paramilitary force aligned with the Somali Regional State government, intervened. Reports indicated severe abuses, including attacks on civilians, destruction of property, and dozens killed. Violence peaked from December 19 to 25, 2024, resulting in over 35 casualties and mass displacement.
Elders attempting mediation were ambushed and some abducted, worsening the conflict. The Liyu Police’s role was condemned by Ethiopian federal authorities and Somaliland officials.
Subsequently, Ethiopian federal forces took control of security in the region, and agreements were reached to remove the Liyu Police from Dacawaley. Joint Ethiopian-Somaliland talks in Jigjiga sought to reduce tensions and address land and resource disputes.
Humanitarian Impact.
The 2024 conflict caused significant humanitarian suffering. Hundreds were displaced, homes and livelihoods destroyed, and vital livestock lost.
Overview.
The Haud is of indeterminate extent; some authorities consider it denotes the part of Ethiopia east of the city of Harar. I.M. Lewis provides a much more detailed description, indicating that it reaches south from the foothills of the Golis and Ogo Mountains, and is separated from the Ain and Nugal valleys by the Buurdhaab mountain range. "The northern and eastern tips lie within the Somali Republic, while the western and southern portions (the later merging with the Ogaden plateau) form part of the Harari Province of Ethiopia." For decades it (as well as the entire Ogaden) has been an area of conflict and controversy. The eastern portion of Haud is traditionally referred to as Ciid. Due to its lack of permanent wells except to its west, the region is for the most part uninhabited during the dry season (January to April) when the nomads cross into Somaliland for grazing.
The British exerted control of the Ogaden beginning in 1941 as part of the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement, administering the Haud as part of the British Somaliland protectorate, although Ethiopian sovereignty was still recognized in the area. This region was defined in the 1942 agreement as including the Ethiopian territory within a continuous belt of Ethiopian territory 25 miles [40km] wide contiguous to the frontier of French Somaliland running from the frontier of Eritrea to the Franco-Ethiopian Railway. Thence south-west along the railway to the bridge at Haraua. Thence south and south-east, excluding Gildessa, to the north-eastern extremity of the Garais Mountains and along the crest of the ridge of these mountains to their intersection with the frontier of the former Italian colony of Somalia. Thence along the frontier to its junction with British Somaliland.
Topography.
The terrain of the Haud consists mainly of plains. The plateau is covered by a characteristic red sand, which conceals solid rocks like Nubian, Lower and Middle Eocene limestones as well as gypseous shales. In the Sool region there is a central area consisting of Middle Eocene anhydrite.
The region is largely covered by bushes, with many species of Acacia and other trees that measure up to 6-10 metres in height with much grass. There is also vast stretches of bush-less grassy plains referred to as "ban" in Somali"." The region is filled with anthills rising up to 7 metres in height.
Flora and fauna.
The region is home to a wide variety of fauna including lions, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas and jackals, as well as many species of antelopes, wart-hogs and a wide array of other smaller animals. The Haud is also home to the Somali ostrich, which is endemic to the region.
Cessation to Ethiopia.
In 1948, under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of Somalis, the British signed the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement and gave Haud and the Somali Region to Ethiopia, based on the earlier Anglo-Ethiopian treaty they signed in 1897 in which the British ceded Somaliland territory to the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against raids by Somali clans. Britain included the proviso that the Somali residents would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over the area. This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somaliland territory that it had turned over (which some presume was a "protectorate" by British treaties with the Somali clans in 1884 and 1886).
Haud delegation.
In response to the cessation of Haud Reserve and the Ogaden regions to Ethiopia in the year 1948, the fifth Grand Sultan of the Isaaq, Abdillahi Deria, led a delegation of politicians and Sultans, including the Habr Awal Sultan Sultan Abdulrahman Sultan Deria and political activist and heavyweight Michael Mariano of the Habr Je'lo, to the United Kingdom in order to petition and pressure the government to return them.
In "Imperial Policies and Nationalism in The Decolonization of Somaliland, 1954-1960", Historian Jama Mohamed writes:The N.U.F. campaigned for the return of the territories both in Somaliland and abroad. In March 1955, for instance, a delegation consisting of Michael Mariano, Abokor Haji Farah and Abdi Dahir went to Mogadisho to win the support and co-operation of the nationalist groups in Somalia. And in February and May 1955 another delegation consisting of two traditional Sultans (Sultan Abdillahi Sultan Deria, and Sultan Abdulrahman Sultan Deria), and two Western-educated moderate politicians (Michael Mariano, Abdirahman Ali Mohamed Dubeh) visited London and New York. During their tour of London, they formally met and discussed the issue with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Alan Lennox-Boyd. They told Lennox-Boyd about the 1885 Anglo-Somali treaties. Under the agreements, Michael Mariano stated, the British Government 'undertook never to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation, save to the British Government, any portion of the territory inhabited by them or being under their control'. But now the Somali people 'have heard that their land was being given to Ethiopia under an Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1897'. That treaty, however, was 'in conflict' with the Anglo-Somali treaties 'which took precedence in time' over the 1897 Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty[.] The British Government had 'exceeded its powers when it concluded the 1897 Treaty and ... the 1897 Treaty was not binding on the tribes.' Sultan Abdillahi also added that the 1954 agreement was a 'great shock to the Somali people' since they had not been told about the negotiations, and since the British Government had been administering the area since 1941. The delegates requested, as Sultan Abdulrahman put it, the postponement of the implementation of the agreement to 'grant the delegation time to put up their case' in Parliament and in international organizations.
Demography.
The Haud is primarily inhabited by the Isaaq clan-family, most notably the Garhajis, Habr Awal, Habr Je'lo and Arap clans, and is part of the wider clan-family's core traditional territory. Several subclans of the Darod clan are also a present minority in the region, most notably the Ogaden, Jidwaaq. Dhulbahante

Elizabeth Fulhame

Elizabeth Fulhame (fl. 1794) was an early British chemist who invented the concept of catalysis and discovered photoreduction. She was described as 'the first solo woman researcher of modern chemistry'.
Although she only published one text, she describes catalysis as a process at length in her 1794 book "An Essay On Combustion with a View to a New Art of Dying and Painting, wherein the Phlogistic and Antiphlogistic Hypotheses are Proved Erroneous." The book relates in painstaking detail her experiments with oxidation-reduction reactions, and the conclusions she draws regarding phlogiston theory, in which she disagrees with both the Phlogistians and Antiphlogistians.
In 1798, the book was translated into German by Augustin Gottfried Ludwig Lentin as "Versuche über die Wiederherstellung der Metalle durch Wasserstoffgas." In 1810, it was published in the United States, to much critical acclaim. That same year, Fulhame was made an honorary member of the Philadelphia Chemical Society. Thomas P. Smith applauded her work, stating that "Mrs. Fulhame has now laid such bold claims to chemistry that we can no longer deny the sex the privilege of participating in this science also."
Personal life.
Elizabeth Fulhame published under her married name, as Mrs. Fulhame. She was married to Thomas Fulhame, an Irish-born physician who had attended the University of Edinburgh and studied puerperal fever as a student of Andrew Duncan (1744–1828). Dr Thomas Fulhame was listed in Edinburgh directories between 1784–1800 (Bristo Square in 1784, Bristo Street in 1794, at 9 Society 1799, in Brown's Square 1800). Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, referred to her as "the ingenious and lively Mrs. Fulhame", however this opinion may reflect the style of her book.
Work.
Mrs. Fulhame's work began with her interest in finding a way of staining cloth with heavy metals under the influence of light. She originally considered calling her work "An Essay on the Art of making Cloths of Gold, Silver, and other Metals, by chymical processes", but considering the "imperfect state of the art", decided to select a title reflecting the broader implications of her experiments.
She was apparently encouraged to publish an account of her 14 years of research as a result of meeting Joseph Priestley in 1793. Fulhame studied the experimental reduction of metallic salts in a variety of states (aqueous solution, dry state, and sometimes an ether or alcohol solution) by exposing them to the action of various reducing agents. The metal salts she examined included gold, silver, platinum, mercury, copper, and tin. As reducing agents, she experimented with hydrogen gas, phosphorus, potassium sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, phosphine, charcoal, and light. She discovered a number of chemical reactions by which metal salts could be reduced to pure metals. Rayner-Canham considers her most important contribution to chemistry to be the discovery that metals could be processed through aqueous chemical reduction at room temperature, as an alternative to smelting at high temperatures.
Her theoretical work on catalysis was "a major step in the history of chemistry", predating both Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Eduard Buchner. She proposed, and demonstrated through experiment, that many oxidation reactions occur only in the presence of water, that they directly involve water, and that water is regenerated and is detectable at the end of the reaction. Further, she proposed "recognisably modern mechanisms" for those reactions, and may have been the first scientist to do so. The role of oxygen, as she describes it, differs significantly from other theories of the time. Based on her experiments, she disagreed with some of the conclusions of Antoine Lavoisier as well as with the phlogiston theorists that he critiqued. Her research could be seen as a precursor to the work of Jöns Jakob Berzelius, however Fulhame focused specifically on water rather than heavy metals.
Further, Eder, in 1905, and Schaaf consider her work on silver chemistry to be a landmark in the birth and early history of photography. Fulhame's work on the role of light sensitive chemicals (silver salts) on fabric, predates Thomas Wedgwood's more famous photogram trials of 1801. Fulhame did not, however, attempt to make "images" or representational shadow prints in the way Wedgwood did, but she did engage in photoreduction using light.
Reception.
In addition to her book being republished in Germany and America, Fulhame's experiments were reviewed in a French journal, and several British magazines, and were positively commented on by Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, and Sir John Herschel.
According to the introduction of her book by her American editor in 1810, her work was lesser known than it could or should have been, adding that "the pride of science, revolted at the idea of being taught by a female". 
Fulhame says as much in her own preface to the work: 
Such a reaction, she says, was particularly acute amongst some who held esteemed positions, whom she described as having a 'dictatorship in science'.
Fulhame published her experiments on reductions using water with metals in a book in the first place in order not to be "plagiarized." She also describes her book as possibly serving as "a beacon to future mariners" (e.g. women) taking up scientific inquiries. Antoine Lavoisier was executed six months before the publication of her book and thus could not respond to her theory. Irish chemist William Higgins complained that she had ignored his work on the involvement of water in the rusting of iron, but magnanimously concluded "I read her book with great pleasure, and heartily wish that her laudible example may be followed by the rest of her sex."
Fulhame's work was largely forgotten by the end of the 19th century, but it was rediscovered by J. W. Mellor. In the 20th century, she was noted in "Physics Today," as being the first to 'systematically' vary 'her reaction conditions' and to 'generalise a whole class of reactions... the reduction of metals' and first to suggest an explanation for the situations where 'water dissociated into its ionic form, facilitated the intermediate reaction steps, and was regenerated by the end of the metal reduction.'

MV Prince of Wales

MV "Prince of Wales" is a ferry operated by the Inter-Island Ferry Authority. She serves as a replacement for her sister ship, , when she is out of service for maintenance. Her route is from Ketchikan to Hollis in Southeast Alaska.
Origin.
In 1992 the state of Alaska passed the Municipal Port Authority Act which allows cities and groups of cities to establish port authorities with powers to sell bonds to support local transportation-related operations. In early 1994 the Alaska Department of Transportation granted $50,000 to the city of Craig to study the potential of such an authority to provide ferry service to Prince of Wales Island. The Alaska Marine Highway System supported this study because it was losing money serving the island with intermittent stops by , and wanted to stop altogether. The residents of the island, on the other hand, wanted daily service and thought that it would stimulate business. In August 1994, the Craig City Council received this report outlining a two-ferry system with a southern route linking Hollis with Ketchikan, and a northern route connecting Prince of Wales Island with Wrangell, and Petersburg. The system would be run by a municipal port authority.
In 1997 six Southeast Alaska communities banded together to form the Inter-Island Ferry Authority. With the help of Alaska's congressional delegation, the authority received a grant of $12.6 million from the Federal Transit Administration, contingent on local matching funding. The state of Alaska declined to support the grant with the local matching funds required, so they were provided by a $200,000 loan from the city of Wrangell, and $1.9 million in municipal bonds backed by a loan guarantee from the Ketchikan Gateway Borough. This initial funding launched the agency and paid for "Prince of Wales".
Construction and characteristics.
"Prince of Wales" was designed by the Elliott Bay Design Group of Seattle, Washington. Based on this design, Inter-Island Ferry Authority requested bids for the construction of its first ship with an option to purchase the second ship in its plan. It received five proposals by the deadline of September 25, 2000. Dakota Creek Industries of Anacortes, Washington won with the low bid of $12.2 million on the first ship. Sea trials on "Prince of Wales" began in early November 2001.
"Prince of Wales" is long with a beam of , and a draft of . Her gross tonnage is calculated as 2,309 and her net tonnage as 1,083. Her hull is constructed of welded steel plates.
"Prince of Wales" cruises at . Her propulsion is provided by two Caterpillar 3512B diesel engines which generate each. These in turn, drive two four-bladed variable-pitch propellers. She has an Omnithruster HT400 bow thruster to improve maneuverability.
The ship is certified to carry 160 passengers and 30 standard-sized cars. Her passenger amenities include a hot-food cafeteria, solarium, forward observation/recliner lounge, and children's play area. Since she is intended for day-use only, there are no staterooms for passengers or crew. The crew does have a break room, lockers, and a separate restroom. She normally sails with a crew of five. Her namesake is Prince of Wales Island, where she is home-ported.
Operating history.
"Prince of Wales" arrived in Ketchikan for the first time on December 29, 2001. Her maiden voyage between Hollis and Ketchikan occurred on January 13, 2002. Later that month she was taken out of service for several days for lack of spare filters for her variable-pitch propeller system. Another early difficulty was that the restaurant concessionaire aboard found that its operations were not economic and broke its 5-year contract after nine months. The restaurant was replaced with the current cafeteria service.
Inter-Island Ferry Authority's second ship was launched in 2006 to support the northern route during summers. During the winter, the two ships took turns maintaining service on the southern route during maintenance periods. In early 2007, for example, "Prince of Wales" returned to Anacortes to receive some of the upgrades built in to "Stikine" from the start, including a more powerful bow thruster, a third generator, and enclosed bridge wings. Meanwhile, "Stikine" maintained the company's sailing schedule on the southern route between Hollis and Ketchikan.
The northern route could not sustain "Stikine" economically, so after the summer of 2008 both ships were used on the southern route. As "Stikine" had slightly greater capacity, she became the primary ferry on the HollisKetchikan route, with "Prince of Wales" becoming a reserve for when "Stikine" broke down or was scheduled for routine maintenance. She was an expensive back-up plan, and cost the authority about $200,000 a year in moorage, insurance, and maintenance. In 2012 Inter-Island Ferry Authority considered selling the ship to save money, but this was never executed.
In May and June 2020 "Prince of Wales" proved an inadequate back-up for "Stikine". She suffered a major propulsion system failure while "Stikine" was already in the shipyard for repairs. This left Prince of Wales Island without ferry service. To assist island residents , operated by the Alaska Marine Highway System, made several runs on the HollisKetchikan route before "Stikine" could be returned to service.

MV Stikine

MV "Stikine" is a ferry operated by the Inter-Island Ferry Authority. Her regular route is between Ketchikan and Hollis, in Southeast Alaska.
Origin.
In 1992 the state of Alaska passed the Municipal Port Authority Act which allowed cities and groups of cities to establish port authorities with powers to sell bonds to support local transportation-related operations. In early 1994 the Alaska Department of Transportation granted $50,000 to the city of Craig to study the potential of such an authority to provide ferry service to Prince of Wales Island. The Alaska Marine Highway System supported this study because it was losing money serving the island with intermittent stops by , and wanted to stop altogether.

In August 1994, the Craig City Council received this report outlining a two-ferry system with a southern route linking Hollis with Ketchikan, and a northern route connecting Prince of Wales Island with Wrangell, and Petersburg. The system would be run by a municipal port authority.
In 1997 six Southeast Alaska communities banded together to form the Inter-Island Ferry Authority. With the help of substantial federal and state investments, the Inter-Island Ferry Authority built and launched service between Hollis and Ketchikan on January 13, 2002. After some early financial and operational challenges, the southern route became a success. Ridership was up sharply in 2003, and an operating profit was projected for fiscal year 2003/2004. With this successful experience, Inter-Island Ferry Authority was able to gain funding for a ship for the northern route, "Stikine".
Construction and characteristics.
"Stikine" began as a twin of "Prince of Wales". Her design incorporated improvements suggested by two years of operating experience, however, so "Stikine" was more capable than her sister ship from her beginning. Bids were solicited, and the winner was Dakota Creek Industries of Anacortes, Washington, which had built "Prince of Wales". Contracts between Inter-Island Ferry Authority and Dakota Creek Industries were signed on December 13, 2004. The contract price for "Stikine" was $16,940,984. Her naval architect and owner's representative during the construction process was Guido Perla &amp; Associates of Seattle, Washington.
"Stikine" was launched on January 23, 2006. She was christened by Nancy Murkowski, First Lady of Alaska. Her husband, Governor Frank Murkowski, was a speaker at the launch ceremonies.
Stikine is long with a beam of , and a draft of . Her gross tonnage is calculated as 2,334 and her net tonnage as 918. Her hull is constructed of welded steel plates.
The ship is certified to carry 190 passengers and 30 standard-sized cars. Her passenger amenities include a hot-food cafeteria, solarium, forward observation/recliner lounge, and children's play area. Since she is intended for day-use only, there are no staterooms for passengers or crew. The crew does have a break room, lockers, and a separate restroom.
"Stikine" cruises at 15 knots. Her propulsion is provided by two Caterpillar 3512 Diesel engines which generate 1,500 hp each. These in turn, drive two variable-pitch propellers. She has an Omnithruster HT400 bow thruster to improve maneuverability.
She normally sails with a crew of five.
Her namesake is the Stikine River, which reaches the sea near Wrangell, one of the stops on the northern route for which she was built.
Operating history.
"Stikine" made her maiden voyage on the northern route on May 18, 2006. She completed one round-trip per day between Coffman Cove and south Mitkoff Island, with a stop in Wrangell. Her sailing from Coffman Cove to Wrangell took about 2 hours and 45 minutes, and from Wrangell to Mitkoff Island about another hour. With an hour budgeted for loading and unloading in Wrangell, the trip from Coffman Cove to Mitkoff Island took about 4 hours and 45 minutes.. The fare from Coffman Cove to Mitkoff Island was $49 for an adult, and $7/foot for cars. Larger vehicles were more expensive. The northern route operated only four days a week so as not to require a second crew for "Stikine". The route operated only in the summer when ferry traffic in Southeast Alaska peaked with tourist crossings.
During the winter, Inter-Island Ferry Authority made use of its two ships to maintain service on the southern route during maintenance periods. In early 2007, for example, "Prince of Wales" returned to Anacortes to receive some of the upgrades built in to "Stikine" from the start, including a more powerful bow thruster, a third generator, and enclosed bridge wings. Meanwhile, "Stikine" maintained the company's sailing schedule on the southern route between Hollis and Ketchikan.
The northern route could not sustain "Stikine" economically. During her first six weeks of operation in 2006, she embarked only 844 passengers and 199 vehicles. Inter-Island Ferry Authority experimented with various traffic-building promotions, without success. After sailing the northern route for the summers of 2006, 2007, and 2008, annual travel never exceeded 3,000 passengers, and 1,000 vehicles. The route was abandoned.
After the abandonment of the northern route, "Stikine" and "Prince of Wales" were both dedicated to the southern route, with the two ships filling in for each other when they had scheduled maintenance or an unexpected mechanical failure. "Stikine" was the primary vessel because of her slightly greater capacity, with "Prince of Wales" acting as a replacement boat. One round trip per day was scheduled. The trip takes three hours each way to cover the 36 miles between Hollis and Ketchikan. In 2020 a one-way fare for an adult was about $50 and for a 16-foot car about $200.
The Alaska Marine Highway System and the Inter-Island Ferry Authority provide each other with back-up capacity when their ships require maintenance. For example, was diverted from her normal MetlakatlaKetchikan schedule in May and June 2020. "Prince of Wales" suffered a major propulsion system failure while "Stikine" was already in the shipyard for repairs. This left Prince of Wales Island without ferry service. "Lituya" made several runs on the HollisKetchikan route before "Stikine" could be returned to service. In a similar manner, Inter-Island Ferry Authority ships have provided service to Annette Island when "Lituya" was under repair.

Bob Finley

Robert Edward Finley (November 25, 1915 – January 2, 1986) was an American professional baseball catcher, who was an SMU back drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1943 and 1944. Finley was a native of Ennis, Texas. He and Charlie Hudson are the only two Ennis natives to appear in Major League Baseball.
Finley played both baseball and football at Southern Methodist University from which he graduated in 1937. He was a member of the SMU 1935 national champions and 1936 Rose Bowl team. At SMU, Finley is most famous for his play on November 30, 1935, in which No. 1 SMU played No. 2 TCU and Sammy Baugh in Ft. Worth. SMU scored the first 14 points of the game. But TCU came back and with the Horned Frogs leading late, 14–13, the Mustangs had fourth-and-four at the TCU 37. Out of punt formation, Finley threw a 37-yard touchdown to Bobby Wilson. SMU won, 20–14, and went to the Rose Bowl.
Finley was the varsity baseball coach at SMU from 1965 to 1976.
Finley was also a football official who worked in the Southwest Conference. He officiated professional football as an umpire and as a referee, one of nine on-field officials to serve in the American Football League (AFL) for its entire ten-year existence, 1960 through 1969. He also was a referee in the National Football League in 1970, the first season following the AFL–NFL merger. Finley retired following the 1970 season; his last game was a Pittsburgh Steelers–Philadelphia Eagles matchup at Franklin Field December 20.
Finley's 1970 crew included umpire Lou Palazzi, head linesman Cal Lepore, line judge Art Holst, back judge Grover Klemmer, and field judge Bob Wortman.
Finley wore uniform number 14 in 1970, which was claimed by line judge and future referee Gene Barth in 1971. Bob Frederic, a back judge on the crew of Jack Vest in 1970, was promoted to referee in 1971 to succeed Finley as crew chief. The other five members of Finley's 1970 crew remained with Frederic through the 1973 season, prior to Lepore's promotion to referee for 1974.
Finley was drafted in the second round (15th overall pick) by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1937 NFL draft. However, he signed to play professional baseball with the Boston Red Sox in 1937 and spent six seasons in the Red Sox organization. Finley is one of many ballplayers who only appeared in the major leagues during World War II. His major league debut came with the Phillies, in a 4th of July doubleheader against the Chicago Cubs at Shibe Park. During Finley's two seasons in the big leagues he appeared in 122 games — 98 as a catcher. Finley batted .251 (91-for-362) with 2 home runs, 28 runs batted in (RBI), and 27 runs scored. In 1944 he ranked fifth in the National League in the hit by pitch category with 5.
On January 2, 1986, Finley died at the age of 70 in West Covina, California.

Pinolenic acid

Pinolenic acid (often misspelled as pinoleic acid) is a fatty acid contained in Siberian Pine nuts, Korean Pine nuts and the seeds and xylem of other pine ("Pinus") species. The highest percentage of pinolenic acid is found in Siberian pine nuts and the oil produced from them.
Chemistry and biochemistry.
Pinolenic acid is formally designated as "all-cis-5,9,12-18:3". Some sources also use the term columbinic acid for this substance. But "columbinic acid" sometimes designates an E-Z isomer ("trans","cis","cis"
"delta"-5,9,12/18:3) in the biologic literature.
Pinolenic acid is an isomer of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). GLA is an ω-6 essential fatty acid (EFA) but pinolenic acid is not. However, like the EFAs, it forms biologically active metabolites in the presence of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase. These metabolites can partially relieve some of the symptoms of EFA deficiency.
Physiology.
Recent research has shown its potential use in weight loss by curbing appetite.
Pinolenic acid causes the triggering of two hunger suppressants—cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).
Pinolenic acid may have LDL-lowering properties by enhancing hepatic LDL uptake.
Natural occurrence.
Oftentimes, it is found in conifers together with other fatty acids (juniperonic, coniferonic, taxoleic, sciadonic acid) that have a double bond in the position 5, separated by more than one methylene group from the next double bond.

Aquarium du Québec

Aquarium du Québec (English: Aquarium of Quebec) is a public aquarium located in the former city of Sainte-Foy in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The facility is home to more than 10,000 animals representing more than 300 species. It is operated by Société des établissements de plein air du Québec (Sépaq), and is a member of the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA).
History.
The origin of the Aquarium du Québec dates back to 1953, when ichthyologist Dr. Vadim D. Vladykov convinced Dr. Arthur Labrie, Deputy Minister of Ministry of Fisheries, to obtain a site near the Quebec Bridge that belonged to the Canadian National Railway. The provincial government acquired the land in 1954, and work to construct the buildings began in 1955.
In 1956, the Biological Centre of Quebec opened, and included laboratories occupied by research teams in marine biology and fisheries, a rotunda, and two series of aquariums. Soon, a research wing was added to house laboratories for research on species with commercial potential, such as salmon, eel, and lobster, and to gather all documents in the library of the Ministry of Fisheries. 230,000 gallons of freshwater were supplied by tanker from Lake Saint-Charles and drawn directly from the St. Lawrence River. The 320,000 gallons of saltwater were brought in from as far away as Rimouski (Pointe-au-Père).
In 1959, after the completion of reception areas and a restaurant, the aquarium opened to the public as the Organic Centre. The Organic Centre's educational mission was provided in collaboration with the Linnean Society of Quebec that establishes a program for children, a first for a museum in Quebec. The 150,000 visitors that were welcomed in the first year caused additional investment for the site that included outdoor pools for seals additional aquariums.
In 1971, researchers at the Biological Centre eventually moved to the new Science Complex of Quebec. To reflect the fact that the aquarium had evolved into a public education facility (although research work in collaboration with universities continues), it changed its name to the Aquarium du Québec.
In 1999, the aquarium welcomed its eight-millionth visitor. However, the facilities had become antiquated, and the Quebec government (the owners) did not want to continue funding a facility that did not pay for itself. The Sépaq was created, with the mandate to manage and renovate the Aquarium, along with the Jardin Zoologique du Québec (Zoological Gardens of Quebec).
In 2002, after two years of closure for renovation, the newly named le nouveau Parc Aquarium du Québec opened its doors next to the zoo. The main building, outdoor gardens, and seal pools were completely refurbished. Most of their international species replaced by aquatic species from Quebec. A polar bear exhibit with an underwater viewing pool was added, though the Aquarium was accused of having a design "off" from the definition of marine life, and of copying another popular attraction, the Zoo Sauvage de St-Félicien. The aquarium did not meet its ambitious attendance targets initially and it reduced its entry price and offered children of Quebec residents free admission until 2006.
In 2005, Michel Després, the provincial minister responsible for the Quebec region announced that the Jardin Zoologique du Québec would close, some activities at the Aquarium would be stopped, and management would be turned over to the Société des établissements de plein air du Québec (Sépaq). The government of Quebec would invest $6.5 million at the aquarium to expand its collection.
In November 2008, the institution changed its name back to Aquarium du Québec and unveiled a new logo.
Attractions.
The Aquarium has a garden, several outdoor pools, and a main building with several exhibits. The Aquarium it also has an annual Light Festival (Festi Lumière) where they display more than 50,000 LED lights in a Holiday motif.
The Aquarium has around 300 species of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and marine mammals in their exhibits housing around 10,000 animals. The Aquarium specializes in boreal and arctic wildlife.
The Aquarium du Québec has seven individual exhibits sectors. Each sector is representative of the wildlife and nature found in a specific geographical region. The sectors are:
Indoors.
The Awesome Ocean exhibit is the main attraction in the aquarium. Visitors walk through a tunnel in a sea water tank and see the marine life from the vantage point of a diver. There are often divers in the exhibit that will showcase the marine life.
This sector showcases the world of Canada's marine invertebrates from both the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean. Visitors are also given the opportunity to interact and even touch the animals such as starfish, sea urchins, hermit crabs, sea cucumbers, and more.
Two levels of aquariums exhibit the estuarine life in the St. Lawrence basin where the fresh water from the river mixes with the salt water of the Atlantic Ocean.
Discover the research that makes the Aquarium du Québec an important place for marine biology in Canada and learn more about marine labs and marine research.
Outdoors.
An exhibition that showcases the ecosystem of the St. Lawrence corridor that includes many birds, amphibians, insects, reptiles, and plants that inhabit the surrounding environment.
While visitors overlook the mighty St. Lawrence River, they can observe the grey and harbour seals as they frolic and play amongst the waves.
Visitors can observe animals that exist in the Arctic, such as Harp seals, walruses, and polar bears as they move through the four different seasons with an underwater glass view. Visitors are also entertained with a daily walrus show that has two Pacific Walruses and one Atlantic Walrus. The Aquarium claims to be the first and only institution of its kind to care for the two subspecies.

Oak Forest High School

Oak Forest High School is a public high school located in Oak Forest, Illinois. It is part of Bremen Community High School District 228 which also includes Tinley Park High School, Hillcrest High School and Bremen High School. It serves most of the community of Oak Forest, as well as portions of Midlothian and Crestwood in Bremen Township in the south suburbs of Chicago in Cook County.
History.
In March 1968, taxpayers of District 228 approved a US$1.3 million loan from the Illinois School Building Commission to begin first phase construction of the district's fourth high school. In August 1968, the Board of Education approved the new school's name, and in September, the architectural plans were approved. The construction contract was approved in March 1969, with the plan calling for an initial "first phase" of construction, and a second phase to be added on if necessary.
Oak Forest High School opened in 1971 as a remedy to the excessively high numbers of students attending the three other existing high schools in the district. Before the school had even opened, it became clear that the school would not be sufficient to contain the increasing student population. The district again turned to voters to approve a bond issue to add onto the school. After two failures, and threats of students needing to attend double shifts, the bond issue passed in December 1971.
On December 2, 1985, a fire broke out at the school causing severe damage to the school's electric systems. After missing a week of school, and with the building still not inhabitable, Oak Forest students were required to temporarily attend classes at Tinley Park High School with split shifts set up (Tinley Park students from 7 am to noon, and Oak Forest students from 12:40 to 6 pm).
Construction to the building in the summer of 2005 created a new Instructional Materials Center (IMC), which serves as media lab and library. Additionally, the space occupied by the old IMC was re-structured into additional classrooms, a move towards solving the approaching five-year deadline of the outdoor portable classroom mobile units (commonly referred to as the "trailers").
Academics.
In 2007, Oak Forest High School had an average ACT score of 21.2 and graduated 97.3% of its senior class. The average class size was 20.2.
In accordance with the federal law No Child Left Behind, Oak Forest has achieved Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). The school has no subgroups that meet the minimum number to be included in testing.
As of January 17, 2022, OFHS has a rating of 9/10 on GreatSchools 
Athletics.
Oak Forest is a member of the South Suburban Conference, with its teams named as the Bengals. The school's teams participate in state championship tournaments sponsored by the Illinois High School Association (IHSA).
The school sponsors interscholastic teams for boys and girls in basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. Boys may also compete in baseball, football, wrestling, while Girls may also compete in badminton, and softball. There are also district water polo and lacrosse teams which students from Oak Forest, Bremen, Hillcrest, and Tinley Park High Schools collectively compete.
The following teams placed in the top four of their respective class in their respective sports in IHSA sponsored state championship series:

Kydex

Kydex is a line of thermoplastic acrylic-polyvinyl chloride materials manufactured by Sekisui SPI. It has a wide variety of applications, including for aircraft bulkheads, firearm holsters, and sheaths.
A similar acrylic polyvinyl chloride material (IPK Acrylic-polyvinyl chloride) is manufactured by Emco Plastics and Interstate Plastics, which carries nearly identical properties with an added layer for screen printing. Kydex has become a generic trademark, and often refers to any material of a similar composition.
Development.
Kydex sheet was originally produced in 1965 by Rohm and Haas, having been designed for use in aircraft interiors. In 1987, the product line was purchased by Kydex, LLC, formerly Kleerdex Company, LLC, which manufactures the material under the name Sekisui SPI at a location in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. In April 2020, the company was renamed Sekisui Kydex, LLC.
Characteristics.
It is an acrylic-polyvinyl chloride composite engineered for thermoforming fabrication, and combines properties of both the acrylic and the polyvinyl chloride components. From acrylic, it obtains rigidity and formability; from PVC, toughness, chemical resistance and good interior finish ratings. Sheet thickness ranges from and can be thermoformed, post formed, brake formed and laminated.
For some applications it is used as replacement for leather, where it has the following advantages:

Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow

Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow is a 7" extended play released in March 1980 by Australian Punk band The Saints. It was produced by the group's singer-guitarist, Chris Bailey using the pseudonym L. Lambert. It is their first release after founding guitarist, Ed Kuepper, had left the band. The Saints line-up for the EP was Chris Bailey on lead vocals and guitar; C. Barrington on guitar; Cub Calloway on guitar; Ivor Hay on drums; and Janine Hall on bass guitar. A 12" version with an additional track, "Miss Wonderful", was issued on the French label, New Rose.
Reception.
Clinton Walker described "Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow" as, "shambolic in the extreme, but still possessed of a certain spark." Australian musician, Paul Kelly remembered that he had "cottoned onto The Saints around the time of "Prehistoric Sounds", their third album. "Paralytic Tonight" is a four track EP that came not long after. I played it over and over again in a flat on Punt Road. This was their great middle period." AllMusic's Mark Deming rated it as three-and-a-half stars out of five and explained, "While these four songs (or five, depending on which version you buy) are tougher and more rock-oriented than the albums that would soon follow from Bailey's edition of the group, they're still a far cry from the breakneck fury of "(I'm) Stranded" or "Eternally Yours"."

Legislative districts of Basilan

The legislative districts of Basilan are the representations of the province of Basilan in the various national legislatures of the Philippines. The province is currently represented in the lower house of the Congress of the Philippines through its lone congressional district.
History.
Prior to gaining separate representation, areas now under the jurisdiction of Basilan were represented under Zamboanga Province (1898–1899; 1935–1953), the Department of Mindanao and Sulu (1917–1935), Zamboanga del Sur (1953–1972) and Region IX (1978–1984).
Even after separating from Zamboanga City and receiving its own charter on June 16, 1948, the city of Basilan remained part of the representations of the Province of Zamboanga (pursuant to Section 42 of Republic Act No. 288) and of the Province of Zamboanga del Sur (pursuant to Section 7 of Republic Act No. 711).
The promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 356 on December 27, 1973, created the province of Basilan out of most of the territory of the former city of Basilan. The city of Basilan itself was delimited only to the downtown area of present-day Isabela until P.D. 840 finally abolished the city on December 11, 1975; the former city's territory, along with the municipality of Malamawi, was merged into the municipality of Isabela. The new province was represented in the Interim Batasang Pambansa as part of Region IX from 1978 to 1984.
Basilan was granted separate representation for the first time in 1984, when it returned one representative, elected at large, to the Regular Batasang Pambansa.
Under the new Constitution which was proclaimed on February 11, 1987, the province constituted a lone congressional district, and elected its member to the restored House of Representatives starting that same year.

Virginia State Route 63

State Route 63 (SR 63) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs from U.S. Route 58 Alternate (US 58 Alternate) in St. Paul north to SR 80 and SR 83 in Haysi.
Route description.
SR 63 begins at an intersection with US 58 Alternate (Bull Run Road) in the town of St. Paul. The state highway heads east through town as Wise Street, which passes under Norfolk Southern Railway's Clinch Valley District. The highway intersects SR 270 (4th Street) in the center of town. SR 63 parallels the Clinch River and CSX's Kingsport Subdivision, formerly the Clinchfield Railroad, east to Lick Creek. The highway and railroad turn north to follow Lick Creek out of St. Paul and cross the Wise–Russell county line. The state highway heads north as Dante Road to Dante, where the rail line diverges to pass through the Sandy Ridge Tunnel. SR 63 crosses Sandy Ridge and the Tennessee Valley Divide at Flint Gap and enters Dickenson County. SR 63 descends as Dante Mountain Road into the valley of McClure Creek and rejoins the Kingsport Subdivision at Trammel. The state highway heads northwest through the village of Nora, where McClure Creek merges with Open Fork to become the McClure River.
SR 63 begins to run concurrently with SR 83 (Dickenson Highway) at Fremont; SR 83 heads west toward Clintwood, the county seat of Dickenson County. The two highways diverge after passing through the town of Clinchco. SR 83 and the railroad continue to follow the river to Haysi while SR 63 turns onto Big Ridge Road. The state highway ascends and has a winding path atop Big Ridge. SR 63 leaves the ridge to descend to the town of Haysi. The state highway passes over the Kingsport Subdivision at the south end of the railroad's short tunnel and crosses Russell Fork of the Big Sandy River just north of its confluence with the McClure River. SR 63 turns east and becomes the town's Main Street before the highway reaches its northern terminus in the center of town at its three-way intersection with SR 80 and SR 83, which follow Main Street east and Sandlick Drive south to cross Russell Prater Fork at its confluence with Russell Fork.

Miami Independent School District

Miami Independent School District is a public school district based in Miami, Texas (USA).
It covers most of Roberts County, and a small portion of the district extends into Gray County.
Miami ISD has one school that serves students in grades pre-kindergarten through twelve.
In 2009, the school district was rated "recognized" by the Texas Education Agency.
History.
A former high school building was rendered useless after a 1969 tornado, so a new facility was built after that.
In 2007 Donna Hale, of the Miami High School class of 1994, became the superintendent, but left the school prior to the 2023-2024 academic year.
The voters approved a bond for $32 million for a new school building in 2014; the decision of the rural Miami community to maintain its own school district and build a new school contrasts with other area communities which instead chose to consolidate with other area school districts.
By 2017 the Miami ISD high school section began an early college program where students may take tertiary courses and receive associates degrees while graduating from high school.

History.
By 1937, most of the rural schools in what is now the Silverton Independent School District area of Briscoe County had transferred their high school students into Silverton High School. The enrollment soared. A.L. (Bud) Kelsey was Superintendent and W.E. Sherman was High School Principal. Superintendents of the District between 1939 and 1950 included Paul S. Rogers, F.M. McCarthy, and M.F. Talley. M.G. Moreland became Superintendent in 1950 and served until his retirement in 1960. J.S. Hinds was Superintendent from 1960 to 1970. O.C. Rampley became Superintendent in 1970. David Cavitt became Superintendent in 1987 after Mr. Rampley's retirement. Cavitt filled the position until 1992 when Frank Kirchoffner was hired. Mr. Kirchoffner was Superintendent until 2002, and Bill Mayfield was hired as Interim Superintendent until current Superintendent Jerry Birdsong was hired in the Fall of 2004.
High School Principals between 1939 and 1953 included W.E. Sherman, Aulton Durham, Mrs. Ben O'King, Frank Porter, and A.D. Gay. M.J. Schofield was Principal from 1953 to 1955. O.C. Rampley became Principal in 1955 until 1970, when he became Superintendent.
The present high school building was built in 1929 after the old building burned. In 1957, the present gymnasium and the original four rooms of the elementary building were constructed. In 1958, the Vocational Agriculture department was added to the west end of the gymnasium. Four elementary classrooms were added to the existing four in 1959. In 1964, the cafeteria was built. This building also includes the home economics department, along with other classrooms. The high school was extensively remodeled in 1970, and a new junior high wing was added to the south side of it. Partitions from the old junior high building were removed to create a football field house and weight room in 1977. A new shop was added to the existing agriculture facilities in 1978. The aging field house was razed in 1996, and a new P.E. gym and athletic field house was built and named in honor of former Superintendent O.C. Rampley.
Many renovations were made in 2006, including entirely replacing the school's lighting systems and HVAC controls, as well as minor renovations in the elementary buildings.
The district has one school that serves students in grades pre-kindergarten through twelve.
The district changed to a four day school week in fall 2021.

Captorhinida

Captorhinida (older name: Cotylosauria) is a doubly paraphyletic grouping of early reptiles. Robert L. Carroll (1988) ranked it as an order in the subclass Anapsida, composed of the following suborders:
While they all share primitive features and resemble the ancestors of all modern reptiles, some of these families are more closely related to (or belong to) the clade Parareptilia, while others are further along the line leading to diapsids. For this reason, the group is only used informally, if at all, by most modern paleontologists. All members of this group are thought to be extinct.

Florence Bascom

Florence Bascom (July 14, 1862 – June 18, 1945) was a pioneer American woman geologist and educator. Bascom became an anomaly in the 19th century when she earned two bachelor's degrees and a masters degree. Earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1882, and a Bachelor of Science in 1884 both at the University of Wisconsin. Shortly after, in 1887, Bascom earned her master's degree in geology at the University of Wisconsin. Bascom was the second woman to earn her PhD in geology in the United States, in 1893. Receiving her PhD from Johns Hopkins University, this made her the first woman to earn a degree at the institution. After earning her doctorate in geology, in 1896 Bascom became the first woman to work for the United States Geological Survey as well as being one of the first women to earn a master's degree in geology. Bascom was known for her innovative findings in this field, and led the next generation of female geologists. Geologists consider Bascom to be the "first woman geologist in America".
Early life.
Florence Bascom was born in Williamstown, Massachusetts, on July 14, 1862. The youngest of five children, Bascom came from a family who, unlike most at the time, encouraged women's entrance into society. Her father, John Bascom, was a professor at Williams College, and later president of the University of Wisconsin. He was the driving factor of her career and her first contact in the field of geology. Her mother, Emma Curtiss Bascom, was a women's rights activist involved in the suffrage movement. Her parents were steadfast supporters of women's rights and encouraged women to obtain a college education.
Her father became the president of the University of Wisconsin in 1874. One year later in 1875, the university began accepting women and Bascom Hill, within the Madison campus, was named after the family and their legacy.
Florence Bascom had a very close relationship with her father and he played a very influential role in her life. Her father had struggled with mental illness and would often take his children exploring into the mountains. These explorations and the various scientific instruments they had in their household encouraged her to have an interest in sciences. Florence graduated with high grades from Madison High School at the age of 16.
Education.
Bascom graduated from the University of Wisconsin with two bachelor's degrees. The first degree was in arts which was received in 1882 and the second was a Bachelor of Science in 1884. Bascom also received her master's in geology in 1887 at the same university and this is where she discovered her interest in geology but specifically in the very unknown field at that time – petrography. After completing her master's, Bascom enrolled at Johns Hopkins University when it allowed women to attend graduate school and continued her studies in petrography there. Bascom's thesis was on "A Contribution to the Geology of South Mountain, Pennsylvania". In 1893, Bascom graduated from Johns Hopkins with her PhD, making her the first woman to graduate the university with that degree and the second woman in the United States to earn a PhD in geology.
While attending the University of Wisconsin, Bascom was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma chapter and was one of the first members to join an all women's fraternities between 1867 and 1902.
Career.
After receiving her PhD, Bascom spent the next two years as an instructor and associate professor at Ohio State University teaching geology. Bascom then went on to Bryn Mawr College and founded the department of geology in 1895 which led to it becoming one of the best departments in the country. Bascom was appointed assistant on the U.S. Geological Survey and later was assigned that section of the Piedmont which lies in Maryland, Pennsylvania and part of New Jersey. In 1899 Bascom went on to teach petrography and by 1906 Bascom became a full professor and had an associate. Bascom spent many summers mapping the schists and gneisses of that area and studied the thin sections of the rocks both during summer and winter. This area of work came with great complexity, however Bascom's work and careful study provided much clarification. Throughout her career of thirty-three years, Bascom continued to work at Bryn Mawr College and retired when the college had just expanded its science building. By 1924, Bascom became a councillor of the Geological Society of America and in 1930 she was appointed as vice-president of that society making her the only woman to have ever held those offices. Bascom's career consisted of her being an editor of the "American Geologist", a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Research Council, as well as the Geophysical Union and many other scientific societies. Bascom had also written many short papers, some which were in the field of geomorphology. Bascom also taught at Hampton Institute of Negroes and American Indians, later renamed Hampton University (1884–1885), Rockford College (1887–1889) and Ohio State University (1903–1895).
Work.
Florence Bascom contributed to a special type of identification for acidic volcanoes. Her article, "The Structures, Origin, and Nomenclature of Acidic Volcanic Rocks of South Mountain", begins by identifying various rock structures formed by the volcano. Bascom argues that South Mountain's rock formations have changed over time, with some rocks originally showing signs of being rhyolite, but now holocrystalline rock. These rocks defy the nomenclature used to identify rocks invented by German and English scientists, so she created prefixes to add to these pre-existing names, to identify acidic changes in rocks. The prefixes she came up with are meta-, epi-, and apo-.
Bascom presented a second notable new conclusion regarding the cycles of erosion within Pennsylvania; earlier scientific thought was that the Piedmont province of Pennsylvania was made by two to three erosion cycles, while she discovered that there were at least nine cycles. Bascom found this by compiling a stratigraphic record of Atlantic deposit in the province, listing the depth, unconformities, and different grain sizes (like sand, clay, or gravel). The cycles occurred over a large period of time, with six cycles occurring in the post-Cretaceous period and three occurring in the Cretaceous period. This conclusion gave scientists new ideas about erosion cycles regarding their rate of occurrence and how to define a cycle. In 1896, Bascom worked as an assistant for the USGS. Her role in the team was to study crystalline schists in a square degree of area along eastern Pennsylvania and Maryland, as well as a portion of northwest Delaware. For part of her life as a teacher, Bascom simultaneously worked in the geological survey and her work lead to a multitude of comprehensive reports of geologic folios.
Bascom spent a year learning and researching advanced crystallography in the laboratory of Victor Goldschmidt in Heidelberg before going back to teaching as she did not want to spend time doing "overspecialistic research", that she would not be able to teach to her students in the courses offered.
Bascom's specialization in petrography focused on complex layers of rocks and mountains. The formations that took place there had been regarded as sediments previously however, the closer study of it done under microscopes proved them to be altered volcanics and not sediments which Bascom then named "aporhyolites" with the prefix of "apo-".
At Bryn Mawr College, geology was considered adjunct in comparison to other natural sciences. Her workspace consisted of storage space in a building constructed solely for chemistry and biology. Over a two-year period, Bascom managed to develop a substantial collection of minerals, fossils, and rocks. Bascom founded Bryn Mawr's department of geology in 1895 and proceeded to teach and train a generation of young women in this department. In the first third of the 20th century, Bascom's graduate program was considered to be one of the most rigorous in the country, with a strong focus on both lab and fieldwork. It was known for training the most American female geologists. Her students did not just graduate, they often succeeded in important geology careers for themselves. Additionally during WW II some of her students were involved in confidential work for the Military Geology Unit in the U.S. Geological Survey. Bascom was known to set high standards for her students as well as herself. Though she was extremely tough, her students were grateful for the quality of education that she gave to them. In 1928, Bascom retired but continued to work at the United States Geological Survey until 1936.
Notable mentors.
Her father, John Bascom, played a pivotal role in Florence Bascom becoming a geologist, beginning when Florence was 12 and her father moved her and her family from their hometown to accept the position as president of the University of Wisconsin, the university where Bascom would begin her education. It was a drive with her father who pointed out a landscape that she did not understand, which intrigued her enough to learn about the earth and its geologic processes. In addition to her father's influence, Bascom's mother, Emma Curtiss Bascom, was an influential member in the suffragette movement in the 19th century.
Bascom trained under experts in metamorphism and crystallography. Bascom's choice of study was strongly influenced by Roland Duer Irving, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, and Charles R. Van Hise, who was Irving's assistant. In the years Bascom worked under the two, 1884–1887, the Geological Survey in Washington had established a division of glacial geology, motivating her to enter the field of petrography and structural geology. This led Bascom to the discovery of "aporhyolites".
George Huntington Williams (1856–1894): Bascom met George Huntington Williams through her early mentor Irving, and later worked with Williams in field research while she was at Johns Hopkins University. Bascom began her studies at Hopkins, and was told there was a chance she would not get her degree because she was a woman. Williams supported her and she later received her PhD.
Edward Francis Baxter Orton (1829–1899): Bascom worked with Edward Francis Baxter Orton while she was at Ohio State University.
Victor Mordechai Goldschmidt (1853–1933): Bascom studied crystallography under Victor Mordechai Goldschmidt while on leave in Germany in 1906–1907.
Legacy.
Florence Bascom left a legacy in part due to her significant scientific discoveries, but also partly due to her legacy of training women geologists. Bascom founded the geology department at Bryn Mawr College and encouraged other women to enter the field of geology. Bascom trained and mentored Louise Kingsley, Katharine Fowler-Billings, petrologist Anna Jonas Stose, petrologist Eleanora Bliss Knopf, crystallographer Mary Porter, paleontologist Julia Gardner, petroleum geologist Maria Stadnichenko, glacial geomorphologist Ida Ogilvie, Isabel Fothergill Smith, Dorothy Wyckoff, and Anna Heitonen.
Bascom's students went on to become successful scientists, and some were featured in "American Men of Science". Those featured were Ida Ogilvie, Eleanor Bliss (Knopf), Anna Jonas (Stose), Isabel Smith, and Julia Gardner.
Death.
Bascom died of a stroke (cerebral hemorrhage) on June 18, 1945, at the age of 82. She is buried in a Williams College cemetery in Williamstown, close to family members.
Publications.
Florence Bascom published over 40 articles on genetic petrography, geomorphology (specifically the provenance of surficial deposits), and gravel. Her own account of her youth in Madison may be found in the "Wisconsin Magazine of History" with the title "The University in 1874–1887", March 1925.

BSA Gold Star

The BSA Gold Star is a motorcycle made by BSA from 1938 to 1963. They were 350 cc and 500 cc single-cylinder four-stroke production motorcycles known for being among the fastest bikes of the 1950s. Being hand-built and with many optional performance modifications available, each motorcycle came from the factory with documented dynamometer test results, allowing the new owner to see the horsepower (bhp) produced.
The Gold Star was almost continuously developed over its lifetime by BSA's engineers and riders, who improved its capabilities and increased output from its essentially simple push-rod petrol engine beyond what had been thought possible. It was highly successful across almost all areas of motorcycle sport for well over a decade and is widely regarded by enthusiasts as a notable design of its era.

In 1937, Wal Handley lapped the Brooklands circuit at over on a BSA Empire Star and was awarded one of the traditional Gold Star badges. That inspired BSA to produce the BSA Gold Star.
The first Gold Star was an M24 model. It had an all-alloy bore and stroke, displacement, with a separate rocker box, bolted to the aluminium head, pushrod valve actuation, an Elektron (magnesium alloy) gearbox with close ratio option, and a rigid frame and girder forks made of Reynolds 531 light tubes devoid of sidecar attachment lugs. This model continued up to the start of World War II.
There were two variants of the M24; 1938, JM24 and 1939, KM24. Both had a capacity of 496cc Several modifications were made to the design during its lifespan. The 1939 KM model used a redesigned crank and crankcase with timing gears on fixed shafts, supported by a strong steel "outrigger" plate (a feature carried on throughout the Gold Star's entire production period.) The earlier JM model had cams that ran directly in the timing cover, with the potential for premature wear, hence the re-design. Power outputs were around 30bhp. The cast Elektron gearbox was dropped in 1939 to use the side-valve M20's cast aluminum shell but with close gear ratios as an option. Some KMs were used by the military at the start of WW2. 266 JM24 models were produced and 298 KM24, of which 120 were sent to destinations outside the UK. There are over 100 recorded survivors on the bsa-m24.com website
1948 ZB32GS introduced.
After the war, in 1945–46, BSA introduced the iron engine B31 and subsequent B33. In preparation for the 1949 model season, and to attract sporting buyers, the bore and stroke, all alloy 348 cc ZB32 type Gold Star was first shown at the Earls Court motorcycle show at the end of 1948, with an extensive list of optional components. Unlike the pre-war M24 engine, the cylinder head was a strong one-piece casting, with the rockers incorporated into the unit. The all-new spring frame had so-called plunger suspension, halfway between the earlier rigid and later swingarm types. These used undamped springs mounted on shafts and forgings on either side of the rear wheel spindle and although they offered more comfort for regular road riding compared to rigid frames, they came in time to be regarded by competition riders and racers as often criticized by competition riders as heavy and difficult to handle. Once ordered the bike was assembled by hand, and the engine bench tested and not released unless an acceptable power output was achieved, which was around , depending on specification. They were lighter than the comparable cast-iron barrel and head B series single. They were almost immediately successful, winning the Manx Grand Prix Clubmans 350 class from 1949 and remained so until 1956 when the class was discontinued. They could be specified in tourer, trials, ISDT, scrambles, racing or Clubman trim. Racing models used the well-established Amal TT carburettor.
The rest of the 1948 BSA OHV B range "YB" models in the standard and competition forms had heavy but reliable cast iron heads and barrels. BSA reportedly experimented with new prototype components. It has been suggested that a very small number of YB32 competition engines may have had aluminum ZB32-type barrels and heads. These would have been "works" prototype bikes rather than true production Gold Stars.
In BSA's model numbering system, Y denotes the year and B the range, followed by the engine number; YB is 1948, ZB is 1949, and so on, except that some models were available for more than one year so the number remained the same over that time. All genuine bench-tested Gold Stars had the addition of "GS" after the year and range letters; thus ZB32GS, followed by the actual engine number. A standard YB32 or subsequent years competition machine was not a Gold Star as it did not have a bench-tested engine or the full "GS" engine number. In subsequent years BSA produced competition machines delineated with a stamped "A" to signify an aluminium engine. They were not bench-tested Gold Star engines, despite the physical similarities and use of some of the same parts.
1949 ZB32GS and ZB34GS.
In 1949 the B32 Gold Star was in full production. The 499 cc B34 Gold Star was introduced, with a modified heavier crankshaft, stronger drive side crankcase, larger diameter drive-side main shaft, and a different design main bearing. The 350 cc continued as before. Spring plunger frames were most commonly used, along with a standard B-type rigid option for trial competition use. In 1950 both received larger 8" front brakes. In late 1951 the 500 gained a new barrel and Bert Hopwood design head with a separate rocker box, and the 350 had a new barrel and head of that design the following year The earlier connecting rod was shortened by , which with other improvements gave an increase in power beneficial for performance. This engine redesign initially used sand-cast heads and barrels, still designated as ZB. After engine number ZB32GS-6001 production moved to die castings which allowed a more accurate and cleaner finish.
1953 BB34GS and BB32GS.
In 1953, a swingarm duplex (twin front downtube) frame was introduced, although rigid and plunger frames were still available, along with a much-improved gearbox for the new frames, with a choice of gear ratios These frames and all later GS and pre-unit B series swingarm frames had a distinctive kink in the lower offside rail, to accommodate and protect the oil-pump casting on the lower timing-side crankcase. A small number of the early swingarm frames had a separate cast steel kink welded or brazed in place. Some modifications were also made to the general design so later frames are somewhat different from the BB type. In all later frames the frame rail was pressed out to form the kink. Some machines specified for lighter-weight competition use had no rear loops that normally held the pillion footrests. Due to the new frame a new larger and more distinctive chrome plated fuel tank was introduced. The engines maintained the same die-cast barrel and head with a separate rocker box design as with the late ZB models. The BB models remained in production for touring and trial competition use into 1954.
1954 CB34GS and CB32GS.
The new CB engine was introduced, (subsequently known as the Big Fin engine), given deeper and squarer finning, a 5 bolt head, quite soon changed to 8 bolts, a stronger crankshaft, an even shorter connecting rod at , oval flywheels (500), improved valve gear with eccentric adjustment, and an Amal GP carburettor. Power outputs were once again increased to around respectively.
1955 DB32GS and DB34GS.
The DB Gold Star had an improved oil feed to the crankshaft and finned front brakes. DB32 models had smaller exhaust valves than the CB32 and power increased slightly to over . Power outputs of the 499 cc engines were developed to about over the next few years. The Clubman cam and timing option included a special silencer. At the end of this year, the BB and CB models were discontinued. The last batch of 350 cc DB32 machines left the factory in 1963.
1956 DBD34.
The 500 cc DBD34 was introduced in 1956, with clip-on handlebars, the same big finned alloy engine with a newly designed head, ) bell-mouth Amal carburettor and swept-back exhaust. The DBD34 had a top speed. The Gold Star dominated the Isle of Man Clubmans TT that year. Later models had an ultra close-ratio gearbox (RRT2) with a very high first gear, enabling before changing up to a second. Amongst the options available were a tachometer and a 190mm full-width front brake that gave a larger lining area than the standard 8" single-sided unit. A scrambles version was also offered. Many of the machines were exported to the USA where there was high demand for them. A series of special models were made for this lucrative market.
Production ended in 1963.
Gold Star Daytona.
In 1954, BSA wanted to win the prestigious United States Daytona 200 race. During the 1950s, the race was run partly on asphalt and partly on the beach at Daytona. A team of workers prepared Gold Stars and A7 Shooting Stars were entered. The race was won by a Shooting Star with a Gold Star in 3rd place. A replica of the work Gold Star was offered to the public. The specification included a rigid frame, which saved over the swinging-arm frame. Engine modifications included using a 350cc head, which had a better downdraught angle, machined to 500cc dimensions and fitted with a large inlet valve. The engine produced 44bhp. The model was also offered in subsequent years.
Rigid framed machines became successful on the USA "Flat Track" scene in the hands of riders such as Dick Mann and tuners like CR Axtell. Special lightweight rigid frames such as the "Trackmaster" were also produced by American makers specifically for this purpose.
A swinging arm version, known by the factory as "USA Short Circuit" was also produced in 1956 and 1957.
Gold Star Catalina.
In 1956, Chuck Minert won the Catalina Grand Prix on a modified Gold Star. (The Catalina Grand Prix was a popular 100-mile race on the island of Santa Catalina off the coast of Los Angeles. In 1956 more than 1,000 bikes started the race.) Modifications included a larger fuel tank, an air scoop on the front brake and a 19" front wheel.
US West Coast BSA distributor, Hap Alzina, persuaded the factory to produce a replica named after the race. The Gold Star Catalina was manufactured from 1959 to 1963.
End of production.
Towards the end of its production life, the Gold Star was offered only in scrambles or Clubman trim. In 1963 Lucas ceased to produce the magneto used in the B series, and that line of singles was ended. The demise of the Lucas magneto was a prime reason that BSA and Triumph reconfigured their pre-unit-construction parallel twins into engines with integral gearboxes, simultaneously converting the ignition system from magneto to battery and coil. The Gold Star was not considered for progression to unit construction, and instead, the 250 cc BSA C15 was developed (via the B40) into the 500 cc B50. Although the B50 never attained the kudos of the DBD34, a B50 fielded by Mead &amp; Tomkinson once held the class lap record in the Production TT, as well as gaining a class 2nd at the 24-hour endurance races in the Le Mans Bol d'Or and a class win at the Montjuïc circuit in Barcelona. CCM used BSA B50 bottom ends in their early specials.
New ownership.
In 2021, the Mahindra Group, the new owners of the BSA marque, announced the production of a new BSA Gold Star.
The first units were shipped to the UK from their manufacturing base in India in October 2022 and are expected to go on sale shortly thereafter through UK dealers.
Isle of Man TT wins.
BSA Gold Stars won the following Isle of Man TT races.

Surhuisterveen

Surhuisterveen () is the largest of the 12 villages of the municipality of Achtkarspelen, in the province of Friesland, the Netherlands. As of 1 January 2017, Surhuisterveen had a population of 5,929.
General information.
The village was first mentioned in 1603 as Surhustera feen. Surhuisterveen began to develop at the end of the 16th century as peat-excavators and boatmen built their homes in the area. The name Surhuisterveen refers to the time of the peat-colonies, and means "the peat-bogs of Surhuizum". The earliest settlers were mainly Mennonites. Surhuizum is another constituent village of Achtkarspelen, which is significantly smaller, but also significantly older than Surhuisterveen. After World War II, Surhuisterveen became a regional centre with an emphasis on retail.
The Protestant Church was built in 1685. The Mennonite Church dates from 1801. The grist mill Koartwâld or Feanstermoune was built in 1864. In 1907, an electro motor was installed. The windmill sail was damaged during a storm in 1946, and not repaired. The wind mill started to become a derelict, and only a ruin remained. In 1990, a restoration project started, and the wind mill was recommissioned in 1995. Surhuisterveen was home to 1,289 people in 1840.
The Centrumcross Surhuisterveen is a cyclo-cross event organized in the village. There is a restored windmill in the village, "Koartwâld". The source of the Lauwers river, as a small stream, is located southeast of the village.

Kingdom of Doom

"Kingdom of Doom" is a song by the British alternative rock supergroup the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen, made up of Damon Albarn, Paul Simonon, Simon Tong and Tony Allen and is the fourth track on their 2007 album "The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen" (see 2007 in British music).
The song was also released as the band's second single in January 2007. Note that the single release, issued a week before the album came out, quite clearly credits the artist as The Good, The Bad &amp; The Queen, although Albarn later claimed the band was unnamed, and that The Good, The Bad &amp; The Queen was simply the name of the album.
Upon release, the single charted at #20, the only one of the band's three singles to reach the Top 20.
Packaging.
The artwork for the red vinyl 7" format of the single was created by the band's bassist Paul Simonon, making reference to the building in which the group recorded the video.

Chet Covington

Chester Rogers Covington (November 6, 1910 – June 11, 1976) was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1944. The 33-year-old rookie, recipient of "The Sporting News" Minor League Player of the Year Award in 1943, was a native of Cairo, Illinois.
Covington is one of many ballplayers who only appeared in the major leagues during World War II. He made his major league debut on April 23, 1944, in a doubleheader against the Boston Braves at Braves Field. His first and only major-league win was in the first game of a doubleheader against the Braves at Shibe Park on April 30, 1944. He pitched in relief and was the pitcher of record in a 14-inning, 2–1 victory.
For the season, part of which was spent in the minor leagues, he appeared in 19 games, all in relief, and had a 1–1 record with 10 games finished. He allowed 20 earned runs in 38 innings pitched for a final ERA of 4.66. In addition, Covington pitched 15 seasons in minor league baseball, winning minor league 220 games.
Covington died at the age of 65 in Pembroke Park, Florida.

Peter O'Sullevan

Sir Peter O'Sullevan (3 March 1918 – 29 July 2015) was an Irish-British horse racing commentator for the BBC, and a correspondent for the Press Association, the "Daily Express", and "Today". He was the BBC's leading horse racing commentator from 1947 to 1997, during which time he described some of the greatest moments in the history of the Grand National.
Early life.
The son of Colonel John Joseph O'Sullevan , resident magistrate at Killarney, and Vera ("née" Henry), Peter O'Sullevan was born in Newcastle, County Down before returning as an infant to his parents' home at Kenmare, County Kerry; he was brought up in Surrey, England. He was educated at Hawtreys, Charterhouse, and later at Collège Alpin International Beau Soleil in Switzerland.
Career.
O'Sullevan was involved, in the late 1940s, in some of the earliest television commentaries on any sport, and made many radio commentaries in his earlier years (including the Grand National before it was televised for the first time in 1960). On television, he commentated on many of the major events of the racing year, including the Cheltenham Festival until 1994, The Derby until 1979, and the Grand National, Royal Ascot and Glorious Goodwood until he retired in 1997. During his career, he commentated on around 30 runnings of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris and racing from the United States and Ireland as well as trotting from Rome during the 1960s.
During his 50 years of commentating on the Grand National, O'Sullevan commentated on numerous historic victories. These included Bob Champion's run on Aldaniti in 1981 after recovering from cancer, 100/1 outsider Foinavon's win in 1967, and the three-times winner Red Rum in 1973, 1974 and 1977. He also commentated on the 1993 Grand National, which was declared void after 30 of the 39 runners failed to realise there had been a false start, and seven went on to complete the course. As the runners approached the second-last fence in the so-called "race that never was", O'Sullevan declared it "the greatest disaster in the history of the Grand National."
O'Sullevan became known as the "Voice of Racing". In a television interview before his 50th and last Grand National in 1997, he revealed that his commentary binoculars came from a German submarine. He was knighted the same year – the only sports broadcaster at that time to have been bestowed that honour. O'Sullevan was also a racehorse owner, including of Be Friendly, who won the King's Stand Stakes at Ascot, and Prix de l'Abbaye de Longchamp. He was twice successful in the Haydock Sprint Cup (then Vernons Sprint) in 1966 and 1967. Another horse he owned was Attivo, whose victory in the 1974 Triumph Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival was described by O'Sullevan as the most difficult race to call. After passing the line, O'Sullevan uttered: "And it's first Attivo, owned by, uh, Peter O'Sullevan... trained by Cyril Mitchell and ridden by Robert Hughes."
Attivo also won the Chester Cup and the Northumberland Plate during the 1970s. O'Sullevan's final race commentary came at Newbury for the 1997 Hennessy Gold Cup, and he visited the winners' enclosure as a winning owner in the race which followed courtesy of Sounds Fyne's victory in the Fulke Walwyn Chase. He was succeeded as the BBC's lead commentator by Jim McGrath.
After his retirement, O'Sullevan was actively involved in charity work fundraising for causes which revolve around the protection of horses and farm animals, including the International League for the Protection of Horses (ILPH), the Thoroughbred Rehabilitation Centre and Compassion in World Farming. The National Hunt Challenge Chase Cup (run at the Cheltenham Festival) was named after him in 2008 to celebrate his 90th birthday. In 2010, Aintree Racecourse named O'Sullevan as one of the eight inaugural "Grand National Legends". His name is inscribed on a commemorative plaque at the course, alongside the likes of Ginger McCain and Captain Martin Becher.
Personal life.
O'Sullevan met his wife Patricia, daughter of Frank Duckworth of Manitoba, Canada, at a ball in Manchester in 1947. She died of Alzheimer's disease in 2010.
He died of cancer at his home in London on 29 July 2015 at the age of 97.

<doc id="6925977" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6925977" title="Ducati Apollo">
Ducati Apollo

The 1964 Ducati Berliner 1260 Apollo was a prototype V4 engine motorcycle producing and capable of over . It was never put into production, but did influence other production Ducatis that followed. Both Ducati and their United States distributor, Berliner Motor Corporation, were experiencing declining sales of existing small-capacity single-cylinder models, and sought to create a bike to compete with Harley-Davidson. Berliner Motor was keen to have a model that could win lucrative police motorcycle supply contracts, and that could also sell as a civilian touring bike.
Concept.
In 1959, the Berliner Motor Corporation approached Ducati about creating a rival to the Harley-Davidson to sell to police departments around the US. Author Greg Field, based on interviews with Mike Berliner, contends that Berliner went so far as to ship two Harley-Davidsons to Italy as examples (one was for Moto Guzzi), and that Ducati, rather than any Japanese company, was the first Harley-Davidson imitator.
The Berliner brothers were enthusiastic. Ducati's government management was not. It was only when Berliner agreed to underwrite a portion of the development costs in 1961, that the project went ahead. They decided to call it the Apollo, in honor of the Moon mission series of the time.
Ducati was to produce two prototypes and two extra engines as spares. Today only one survives.
Mechanicals.
Fabio Taglioni was to develop a bike that conformed to US police specifications, and was bigger than any current model Harley-Davidson. Taglioni decided on an air-cooled 1257 cc 90° two-valve head V4 using a 180-degree crankshaft with roller bearing big ends. That crankshaft fitted into a horizontally split wet sump crankcase with a center main bearing support. The bore was 84.5 mm, and the stroke 56 mm. Valve actuation was by pushrods and rocker arms.
The engine was a stressed member of the heavy duty open cradle frame with a central box section front downtube between the forward cylinders. A small car-sized starter motor and generator were fitted. It had a five-speed transmission, at a time when most motorcycles had four. Ceriani developed the suspension package, but riders today would be alarmed by the inadequate front and rear single leading shoe drum brakes. The stopping distance was huge, and had to be allowed for. It had a wheelbase, and weighed dry. Taglioni dismissed the Berliners' suggestion of shaft drive, and chose chain final drive. The police specification stipulated 16-inch tyres, so there was little choice in that.
Performance.
Initially it was putting out @ 7000 rpm, and could exceed . The Harley of the time made 55 bhp. The first test rider Franco Farne came back from his first ride, and said it “handles like a truck.” Farne normally rode small racers. It soon became evident that even specially made tyres were not up to the power of the engine. A tyre disintegrated at speed on the Autostrada, and the test rider rated his survival “a miracle”. The engine was detuned to give . Tyres continued to disintegrate. The engine was brought down to , and the survival rate of the tyres became acceptable. This was late 1963. In comparison, in 1958 Moto Guzzi had used a 20-inch rear tyre on the Grand Prix 500 cc V8, and they had worn rapidly with 
In March 1964 a gold-painted prototype was handed over in a formal ceremony.
The reduction in power meant that the Apollo could now be outperformed by the British and BMW twins, which restricted the anticipated market to police forces. Berliner was printing advertising, demonstrating the prototype to Police Chiefs, and genuinely preparing to market the Apollo.
Berliner specification sheet.
This is from a promotional flyer distributed by Berliner Motor Corporation, which also included a front three quarter black and white view of the gold bike. The US$1,500 selling price would be US$ in 2008 dollars.
Project end.
The Apollo appeared at the Earls Court, London motorcycle show in November, 1964. UK magazine "Motor Cycle" confirmed the massive 1,260 cc four-cylinder engine of the Apollo attracted plenty of attention on the Ducati stand, and further carried a quip allegedly heard between two visitors: "I wonder if I could get that lot into a Norton Featherbed frame?".
The Italian government decided that the limited market did not justify the tooling costs of production, and withdrew project funding. This was a severe blow to Berliner's business plans.
It could have been a superbike before its time, but tire technology was not ready. There were other bikes developed as a result: the 1970 500 cc GP bikes and 750 cc production 90-degree V-twins.
The second prototype, a black and silver sports version with four Dell'Orto SS 1 carburettors, survived, and was on display at Ducati's factory museum in Bologna, courtesy of its owner, Hiroaki Iwashita, from 2002 to 2003, but now resides in his museum in Yufuin on the island of Kyushu.
The machine's sole public appearance in recent decades was at the 2002 Goodwood Festival of Speed, where it was display-ridden up the test hillclimb by motorcycling journalist Ian Kerr. It had previously been substantially overhauled at the Ducati works in Italy by two ex-race mechanics. 
The fate of the first gold painted prototype was unknown until a recent YouTube video published in June 19 2025 revealed that a Japanese collector owns it. 
Sequel.
The Berliner brothers' quest for an offering in the police fleet and big touring cruiser market did not end with the Apollo. As the Apollo project was wrapping up, Joe Berliner saw the Moto Guzzi V7 for the first time, a prototype to be entered in a contest, set to begin in 1966, by the Italian Ministry of Internal Affairs to select a replacement for their outmoded military and police fleet.

Fort Duffield

Fort Duffield is a Union American Civil War fort located outside West Point, Kentucky. It saw use in 1862, and was abandoned when it appeared that the war would never come near the fort. Ironically, John Hunt Morgan would in 1863 lead his Raiders right past the fort and may have been stopped had the fort not been abandoned.
William Tecumseh Sherman was concerned with the Confederate positions in Bowling Green and Columbus, and sent the 37th Indiana and the 9th Michigan regiments to West Point. The plan was to use West Point as a Union supply base for Elizabethtown. Sherman ordered the fort to be built on Pearman Hill to protect the town and supply route. Construction began on November 3, 1861, and was finished in two months. The fort was named for the Rev. George Duffield of Detroit, whose son, Colonel William W. Duffield, led the 9th Michigan Infantry. There were 950 troops stationed there, but they were soon sent to the front lines and the fort was mostly unused in 1862, seeing its last use that fall.
The fort is mostly a serpentine wall, unlike the typical star-shaped Civil War forts in Kentucky. The earthworks of the fort are well-preserved. Originally there was a one-mile clearing between the fort and any trees, but since the fort's abandonment the forest has grown back around the fort. A fresh water spring was located inside the fort.
In 1995 a team of volunteers led by Billy Morris and Dennis Wren started the clearing of overgrowth. By 1996 it was opened as a tourist attraction. You could catch a bus in the town of West Point and ride it to the top of the steep hill where there are wooden facilities and an information station showing a map of the fort and the different paths to take. The full tour of the fort included wooden walkways to the top where you could see small cabins built and tents where reenactors would do demonstrations. You could follow the path on to the lookout point that gives a clear view of the Ohio River and West Point. From there you were able to take a small pathway past the very natural spring that was used in the times of the Civil War. This trail took you back to the beginning of the wooden pathway and start of the walking tour by the information station and outhouses.
As of 2021 there are not any reenactments or bus rides currently but you can still hike the hill and follow the trails and pathways and see the little cabins. There is a bench to sit at the lookout point. However it's too dangerous to go by the natural spring so that has been excluded from the public trail. Volunteers from West Point Historical Society and the West Point Historical Museum including Mony Matthews and Chris Lueken help with the upkeep of the fort. There is also a Civil War cemetery on the west side of Fort Hill that has been updated with new grave markers and cleared out for visitors to experience. The bottom of Fort Hill has a parking lot and there are multiple biking trails that start right off the parking lot to take advantage of the beautiful area. Also there is a boat dock/camp ground to the left of the entrance off of Dixie hwy (31w) that puts you in to the Salt River.

Harkema

Harkema () is a village in the municipality of Achtkarspelen, province of Friesland, the Netherlands.
Harkema is in the eastern part of Friesland, north of Drachten. It was once known as "Harkema-Opeinde". As of January 2017, the village had a population of 4,295.
History.
The village was first mentioned in 1530 as "Opeyndt". The name "Harkema" means 'settlement of the descendants of Buwe Harkema'. In 1972, the name was officially changed from "Harkema-Opeinde" to "Harkema". 
Harkema was originally a peat-excavation settlement. The initial linear settlement which mainly consisted of sod houses disappeared in the 18th century, but re-emerged during the 19th century. In 1840, it was home to 484 people. In 1883, a church was opened in a wooden shed, and was replaced in 1891 by a real church. The church was too small and was replaced by the current church in 1913. In the 1960s, Harkema experienced growth and started to attract industry.
Sports.
Harkema is home to the amateur football club Harkemase Boys. Cyclist Pieter Weening, who was the first Frisian to win a stage in the Tour de France, is from Harkema—along with another former cyclist pro, Wiebren Veenstra.

Florence Cushman

Florence Cushman (1860–1940) was an American astronomer specializing in stellar classification at the Harvard College Observatory who worked on the "Henry Draper Catalogue".
Life.
Florence was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and received her early education at Charlestown High School, where she graduated in 1877. In 1888, she began work at the Harvard College Observatory as an employee of Edward Pickering, observing and classifying stars. Florence was one of the "Harvard Computers" who worked under Pickering and, following his death in 1919, Annie Jump Cannon. Her classifications of stellar spectra contributed to "Henry Draper Catalogue" between 1918 and 1934. She stayed as an astronomer at the Observatory until 1937 and died January 30, 1940, at the age of 80.
Career at the Harvard College Observatory.
Florence Cushman worked and was a member of the Harvard College Observatory from 1888 to 1937. She started her work by observing and classifying starts as one of Annie Jump Cannon’s assistants. Florence was also in charge of proofreading text and tables in the catalogs before publication alongside other colleagues. Over the course of her forty-nine years at Harvard, she employed the objective prism method to analyze, classify, and catalog the optical spectra of hundreds of thousands of stars. In the 19th century, the photographic revolution enabled more detailed analysis of the night sky than had been possible with solely eye-based observations. In order to obtain optical spectra for measurement, male astronomers at the Observatory worked at night, exposing glass photographic plates to capture the astronomical images. 
During the daytime, female assistants like Florence analyzed the resultant spectra by reducing values, computing magnitudes, and cataloging their findings. She is credited with determining the positions and magnitudes of the stars listed in the 1918 edition of the "Henry Draper Catalogue", which featured the spectra of roughly 222,000 stars. In describing the dedication and efficiency with which the Harvard Computers, including Florence, undertook this effort, Edward Pickering said, "a loss of one minute in the reduction of each estimate would delay the publication of the entire work by the equivalent of the time of one assistant for two years." She is referred to as a “dignified galleon of a woman” and a “Lady of the Old School” by Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, a fellow Women Astronomical Computers member that discovered the chemical composition of stars and pointed out the abundancy of hydrogen and helium atoms in them.

KVEC

KVEC (920 AM) is a commercial radio station that is licensed to San Luis Obispo, California, United States and serves the Central Coast of California. The station is owned by American General Media and broadcasts a news/talk radio format featuring a variety of nationally syndicated talk shows as well as a program hosted by Dave Congalton.
KVEC is rebroadcast on FM translator station K243CL on 96.5 MHz in San Luis Obispo.
History.
KVEC first signed on in 1937 on the 1200 kHz frequency. The station originally was owned by Valley Electric Company (hence its call sign), headed by Christina M. Jacobson. In March 1941, under the terms of the NARBA Havana Treaty, KVEC was relocated to 1230 kHz. The station changed frequencies once more in 1946 to 920 kHz.
In April 1956, Jacobson sold KVEC and its television sister station KVEC-TV (channel 6) to The Valley Enterprises Company for $450,000. The media company, headed by John C. Cohan, was the owner of KSBW-AM-TV in Salinas, California. Cohan took sole ownership of KVEC and its TV counterpart, then known as KSBY-TV, the following year. In November 1965, Cohen sold KVEC and its three-year-old FM sister station (now KZOZ) to West Coast Broadcasters Inc., majority owned by James L. Sephier, for $360,000. On January 6, 1975, West Coast Broadcasters sold KVEC to Century Broadcasting Company for $500,000.
The 1980s and 1990s saw KVEC face a series of financial troubles and ownership changes. In 1985, Five Cities Broadcasting Inc. purchased the station from the Century Broadcasting Company Liquidating Trust for $500,000 and paired it with KPGA (95.3 FM). However, the following year, Five Cities defaulted on a loan, leading to the involuntary transfer of both stations' licenses to U.S. Media Company. In August 1989, U.S. Media sold news/talk-formatted KVEC to Chorro Communications Inc. for $300,000; KPGA was divested separately a month later. In September 1991, Richard Mason sold his 70% stake in Chorro Communications to partner Francis Sheahan for $353,900, granting the latter full control of KVEC. Portions of the proceeds were used to settle a debt owed to Mason and to pay taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service.
In November 2000, Clear Channel Communications purchased KVEC from Chorro for $950,000 as part of a nationwide station buying spree. In July 2007, the station was among 16 Clear Channel outlets in California and Arizona that were sold to El Dorado Broadcasters for $40 million. In early 2016, El Dorado began selling off its Central Coast stations. These divestitures included KVEC, sold to Bakersfield, California-based American General Media for $450,000 that May.

Methoxypropane, or methyl propyl ether, is an ether once used as a general anaesthetic. It is a clear colorless flammable liquid with a boiling point of 38.8 °C.
Marketed under the trade names Metopryl and Neothyl, methoxypropane was used as an alternative to diethyl ether because of its greater potency. Its use as an anaesthetic has since been supplanted by modern halogenated ethers which are much less flammable.

Legislative districts of San Jose del Monte

The legislative districts of San Jose del Monte are the representations of the component city of San Jose del Monte in the Congress of the Philippines. The city is currently represented in the lower house of the Congress through its lone congressional district.
History.
San Jose del Monte was represented as part of Bulacan's at-large district in the Malolos Congress (1898–1899) and the National Assembly of the Second Philippine Republic (1943–1944) and the second district from 1907 to 1941 and from 1945 to 1972. The province of Bulacan was represented in the Interim Batasang Pambansa as part of Region III from 1978 to 1984, and elected four representatives at-large to the Regular Batasang Pambansa in 1984.
San Jose del Monte was placed in the fourth district of Bulacan after the reorganization of the province's legislative districts under the new Constitution which took effect on February 7, 1987. San Jose del Monte, which became a city in 2000, was separated from the fourth district of Bulacan on December 18, 2003 by virtue of Republic Act No. 9230 which amended the city charter (Republic Act No. 8797) authored by then Congressman Angelito Sarmiento, and elected its own representative starting in the 2004 elections. However, the city's residents still vote as part of the province's 4th "Sangguniang Panlalawigan" district for the purpose of electing Provincial Board members.

Transradio Press Service

Transradio Press Service was founded by Herbert Moore in 1934. Its mission was to supply news to radio stations by teleprinter and shortwave. The service folded in 1951.
The beginnings.
After leaving CBS in 1934 Herbert Moore, a former United Press reporter, had the idea to create a dedicated service to provide copy for radio news broadcasts. At that time newspapers saw radio stations as competition for advertising dollars - so much so that when CBS attempted to set up its own news service the major newspaper chains threatened to stop carrying CBS program listings. Accordingly, Press-Radio Bureau, an agency set up by the three major press agencies, Associated Press, United Press, and International News Service, limited the news content they made available to two five-minute broadcasts and intermittent news flashes for major breaking stories. Moore was able to raise $150,000 of start up capital and launch the Transradio Press Service in Manhattan.
When the service began it had 50 radio clients and another 75 clients which received limited news by sending reports written in Morse code over shortwave radio. Some of Transradio's early clients included: KNX in Hollywood, KSTP in St. Paul, the Michigan Network, the Yankee Network in New England, WLS in Chicago, KWK in St. Louis, CFCF in Montreal, and CJRM in Regina, Saskatchewan. Transradio charged different rates for different clients, depending on their market. A station in Casper, Wyoming paid only $15 per week while the Yankee Network paid $1,000 per week.
In October 1934 Moore managed to work out a deal with WOR in Manhattan for $1,500 a week, rising to $5,000 if WOR was able to sell commercials for the bulletins. The deal launched Transradio into the largest radio market in the country.
Transradio's heyday.
Within five years the company had 400 radio and newspaper clients and 600 stringers and reporters worldwide. In fact, Transradio's success was influential over the other big news services, Associated Press, United Press and the International News Service. They all soon realized that they had missed the boat with radio coverage and began to peddle their own news to radio stations. This put the squeeze on the upstart Transradio.
By 1940, Transradio was sending news out to hundreds of stations in the U.S. and Canada, distributing foreign news from France's Agence Havas, Britain's Central News Agency, Germany's Trans-Ocean News Service (part of DNB (Deutsche Nachrichten Buro)), British Official Wireless, and its own private sources, including the pioneering foreign correspondent Betty Wason, who started the Czechoslovakian bureau in 1938. In 1940, Canadian authorities expressed their ire with commercially sponsored news, which was outlawed in Canada, when Transport Minister Clarence Howe arose in Ottawa's House of Commons and announced the two sponsored news services in Canada, Transradio and British United Press, must "show their news sources to be accurate," or risk losing their licenses on July 1.
Moore went up to Ottawa and claimed there was a plot by "selfish publishing and monopolistic interests ... to destroy independent news services throughout the Dominion." As the licenses were set to expire the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, whose own unsponsored news came from Canadian Press, reversed the decision and agreed to let Transradio transmit indefinitely. 
Herbert Moore left Transradio in 1942 for the publishing business and his brother, Robert Moore, took over as president.
The end of an era.
Transradio folded in 1951 with only 50 clients and 25 staff left.

Quebec (1951 film)

Quebec is a 1951 American historical drama film directed by George Templeton and written by Alan Le May. Set in 1837, it stars John Drew Barrymore in a fictional account of the Patriotes Rebellion. The popular uprising in Lower Canada, now Quebec, sought Democratic reforms, and happened around the same time as a similar revolt in Upper Canada, now Ontario.
Plot.
The film tells the tale of Mme. Stephanie Durossac, also known as Lafleur (played by Corinne Calvet), a fiery pro-independence leader, and Mark Douglas (Barrymore), a young man who discovers that Lafleur is his long-lost mother he believed to be deceased. The actions of Lafleur create problems since she is also the wife of the British governor of the province. Lafleur ultimately sacrifices herself to prevent Douglas from being taken hostage. The climax of the movie depicts a military assault on the British fortress.
Production.
The film was actually shot on location in Quebec, in the fashion typical of post-war Hollywood. It captured therefore local sights like the Citadelle of Quebec City, Montmorency Falls and the Quebec countryside. It also cast local actors. "Quebec" also features Patsy Ruth Miller, a former silent-screen star making her first screen appearance since 1931.

Legislative districts of Zamboanga Sibugay

The legislative districts of Zamboanga Sibugay are the representations of the province of Zamboanga Sibugay in the Congress of the Philippines. The province is currently represented in the lower house of the Congress through its first and second congressional districts.
History.
Prior to gaining separate representation, areas now under the jurisdiction of Zamboanga Sibugay were represented under the Department of Mindanao and Sulu (1917–1935), the historical Zamboanga Province (1935–1953), Region IX (1978–1984) and Zamboanga del Sur (1953–1972; 1984–2001).
The passage of Republic Act No. 8973 on November 7, 2000, and its subsequent ratification by plebiscite on February 22, 2001, separated the entire third district of Zamboanga del Sur to form the new province of Zamboanga Sibugay. Zamboanga del Sur's former third district automatically became the representation of Zamboanga Sibugay upon its establishment in February 2001, but the new province only elected a representative under its own name beginning in the May 2001 elections.
The enactment of Republic Act No. 9360 on October 26, 2006, increased Zamboanga Sibugay's representation by reapportioning the province into two congressional districts, which began to elect their separate representatives in the 2007 elections.

Moscow International House of Music

The Moscow International Performing Arts Centre was officially opened on September 28, 2003 with the debut of a new orchestra, the National Philharmonic of Russia under musical director Vladimir Spivakov. Also known as the Moscow International House of Music ("Dom Muzyki"), it is situated on the Kosmodamianskaya Embankment off the Garden Ring Road.
The architects were Yury Gnedovsky, Vladilen Krasilnikov, Dmitry Solopov, Margarita Gavrilova, and Sergey Gnedovsky of Krasniye Kholmy Russian Cultural-business Centre and Tovarishestvo Teatralniy Arkhitekturov. The project won the Khrustalny Dedal architectural award at the XI All-Russian Zodchestvo festival. The first stone was laid on September 7, 2000 by Spivakov and Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov. The Turkish firm Enka Insaat ve Sanayi A.S. constructed the centre. The centre cost US$200 million to construct, and was financed entirely by the City of Moscow. It was the first classical music hall constructed in the city in over a century. It is part of a business and hotel complex called Riverside Towers, intended by the City to be its equivalent of Lincoln Center.
The centre has a circular concert hall similar to the Philharmonie in Berlin. Seating is laid out on two principal levels, and arranged in various tiers that almost surround the stage. The hall is on the third storey, with promenade areas below. The auditorium seats 1,735, and is composed largely of Siberian larch wood, a blonde wood considered among the best for acoustics, with a light, airy look. The centre also houses a 575-seat chamber hall and a 532-seat theater. In addition to the three concert venues, it also has sound studio, a rehearsal hall, an audio-video complex, an exhibition hall, a hall of light, music rooms, the Allegro restaurant, a Bluthner music room, a summer patio called the Music Terrace and another concert hall that seats 120. The modernistic, cylindrical glass and steel centre is topped by an enormous, 9.5 metre-tall, 2 metric-ton treble clef covered in mozaic gold that rotates like a weathervane, designed by sculptor Zurab Tsereteli.
It also has the largest organ in Russia, installed in Svetlanov hall in 2004. The organ was co-designed and built by the German firms of Glatter-Goetz and Johannes Klais. It has more than 5,500 pipes, ranging in size from 8 millimetres to 9.25 metres, and weighs 30 tons. It has 84 stops – three more than the second-largest Russian pipe organ, located at Moscow's Tchaikovsky Concert Hall.
An early review in the newspaper Vedomosti questioned the "imperfect acoustics" of the main hall, although this review preceded installation of the organ, which was expected to alter the acoustics, and after which adjustments were anticipated.
The centre was originally conceived as a home for the Russian National Orchestra. At the end of the 2002–2003 concert season, the Russian National decided not to renew Spivakov's contract as principal conductor and musical director, and he abruptly resigned. Spivakov lobbied government officials to conduct a new orchestra in Moscow. The National Philharmonic Orchestra was then formed under an executive order of Culture Minister Mikhail Shvydkoi, supported by President Vladimir Putin. Shortly after Spivakov became president of the Centre in May 2002, the Centre canceled the bookings for the Russian National, which rebooked some dates at higher fees and lost others.
Performances and premieres.
In 2003, the world premiere of Vladimir Martynov's opera "Vita Nova" was performed by the Kirov Opera in concert format as a part of the 2003 Moscow Easter Festival.
In December, 2003, the National Philharmonic performed the Moscow premiere of Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki's oratorio "The Seven Gates of Jerusalem".
In 2007, the world premiere of Greek composer Dimitri Arapis's Symphony No.3 was performed by the State Symphony Orchestra and Capella of Russia, conducted by Valery Poliansky.
In February 2018, the Musica Viva Chamber Orchestra (Московский камерный оркестр Musica Viva) performed the World Premiere of Mexican composer Venus Rey Jr's song cycle "The Pavlova Songs", with poems of Russian poet Vera Pavlova.

Virginia State Route 65

State Route 65 (SR 65), formerly State Route 66 (SR 66), is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs from U.S. Route 23 (US 23), US 58, and US 421 in Clinchport north to US 58 Alternate in Castlewood.
Route description.
SR 65 begins at an intersection with US 23, US 58, and US 421 (Orby Cantrell Highway) just west of the town limit of Clinchport. The state highway heads northeast through the town as 2nd Avenue, which passes under CSX's Kingsport Subdivision. SR 65 becomes Clinch River Highway east of town and parallels the Clinch River and Norfolk Southern Railway's Clinch Valley Division northeast to Fort Blackmore, where the highway begins to run concurrently with SR 72 (Veterans Memorial Highway) to the town of Dungannon. Within the town, SR 72 continues north parallel to the railroad and the Clinch River as Hanging Rock Parkway while SR 65 crosses the river and heads east as Sinking Creek Highway, which follows Sinking Creek across the Scott–Russell county line. The state highway, now named Mew Road, passes through the hamlet of Mew while passing through a broad valley on its way to its northern terminus at US 58 Alternate (Castlewood Road) at Banners Corner in the unincorporated area of Castlewood.
History.
SR 65 was designated in March 1958 as a result of the renumbering of the former SR 66 between Clinchport and Castlewood. SR 66 was renumbered due to the impending construction of Interstate 66 in the northern part of the state; the Commonwealth Transportation Board recommended that all routes that shared a number with a proposed Interstate be renumbered. No major routing changes have occurred to the route since its designation.

Rolling (video game)

Rolling is a 2003 extreme sports video game developed by Rage Software and published by SCi for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game is a simulation of aggressive inline skating in which players skate as one of twenty professional skaters and complete various goals across fourteen levels. Described by the publisher as "the world's most realistic in-line skating game", the game was developed with a realistic design approach, using the input of professional skaters and basing several levels on international skate parks. Production of "Rolling" was troubled, with the game's release endangered following the financial troubles and collapse of developer Rage Software. SCi acquired and published the game in Europe, with plans for a Game Boy Advance and GameCube release abandoned. Upon release, "Rolling" received mixed reviews, with several reviewers critiquing the game's linear and dated design compared to the innovations in more recent extreme sports titles, including the "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater" series. 
Gameplay.
"Rolling" is an extreme sports video game in which the player completes aggressive inline skating challenges across self-contained levels, and earns points for various tricks performed by pressing the controller's face buttons, including grabs, flips and grinds, while in the air or near edges of objects. While skating normally, the user can also "cess slide" by using the shoulder buttons, and 'manual' by pressing the Up and Down directional buttons in quick succession. In the game's main 'Career' mode, players choose a professional or custom skater and skate across time-limited runs across ten street levels and four competition levels. Street level objectives include earning a certain number of points in a run, collecting various objects, and earning enough points or performing a certain trick in front of a cameraman. Competition level objectives consist of completing three runs to earn the highest overall score, based on points accumulated, with the first run being a qualifier and the second runs being judged. As the player progresses in objectives, they earn reputation, which allows them to unlock new levels, sponsors, and tricks. Completing tricks across the game improves the player's statistics in ten areas, allowing them to improve their speed, air, and performance of tricks. 
in 'Practice' mode, players can freely skate in levels unlocked in the Career mode without a time limit, although there are no objectives and statistics cannot be improved. "Rolling" features a multiplayer mode supporting two-player co-operative play across several challenge types, including to get the highest score in 'High Score', collecting pickups dropped by completing high scoring tricks in 'Stealing Scores', passing a bomb in 'Time Bomb', following or avoiding players in 'Close Up', performing tricks in certain zones in 'In the Zone', and tagging a logo in as many zones as possible in 'Tagging'. The game also features a player editor that allows the user to assign biographical details, different hair, skin, tattoos and clothing items unlocked in career mode, and a level editor that allows the player to create their own skatepark for use in practice and multiplayer modes.
Development.
"Rolling" was created by Rage Software, a Liverpool based studio who developed several sports video games including the "Striker" series of association football video games. Originally announced under several working titles, including "Cesar and Fabiola's Inline Skate" and "SK8", the title was announced for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 at E3 2001, with the game featuring inline skaters including Cesar Mora and Fabiola da Silva, described as an "athletic, fast and exciting" aggressive inline skating title. Majesco Sales originally was slated to publish the title in North America, with ports of the game planned for the GameCube and independent developer Fluid Studios to port the game to the Game Boy Advance. The game was developed with the intent of being an "authentic" representation of aggressive inline skating, engaging regular input from professional skaters and representing several international skate parks, including Rampworx Skatepark in Liverpool, Escondido Skatepark in California and G-Skates Skatepark in Kobe.
"Rolling" experienced a troubled publication due to the collapse of developer Rage Software. In 2002, the developer entered financial problems following a decision to engage in heavy investment in a transition towards publishing games, leading to a sharp fall in the company's share prices. Following the collapse of the company in January 2003, plans to publish the game with Majesco Sales in North America were abandoned, with SCi acquiring the title for a planned release in Europe. SCi development director Darren Barnet noted the publisher was "extremely impressed" with the title, and hired members of the original development team to finalize the final touches on the "very complete" game.
Critical reception.
"Rolling" received mixed reviews, with an average review score of 57% according to review aggregator GameRankings. Several reviewers assessed the game as a poorer imitation of the "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater" series of extreme sports games. Describing the game as "playable" but "mediocre", "Official Xbox Magazine UK" described the game as "dated and derivative" due to its resemblance to earlier "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater" titles, writing "had this been released two years ago, it might have felt quite ordinary. Now, it's almost bordering on the retro." "Game Power Australia" similarly critiqued the game, citing its "seemingly pointless goals" and absence of innovations in newer extreme sports titles, such as the removal of time limits, manual tricks, and reverts, writing "if you've played a "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater" game, you really have seen everything "Rolling" has to offer. "GamesMaster" critiqued the game as a "step backwards compared to practically every other extreme sports game around", citing the "dull" backgrounds, lack of depth, and "dodgy controls". However, whilst noting that the game "copies "Tony Hawk's" but can't match (its) gnarled greatness", "Official PlayStation Magazine UK" stated that the game "defies expectations" and praised the game's animation, career mode, and soundtrack.

2006 Washington Redskins season

The 2006 season was the Washington Redskins' 75th in the National Football League (NFL), and the third under head coach Joe Gibbs since his return to the team in 2004.
The team had posted a 10–6 record and a postseason berth the previous season (up from 6–10 in 2004). In 2006, however, the Redskins posted only five wins and finished last in the division.
The 2006 Redskins set an NFL record for fewest takeaways in a (non-strike) NFL season, with only twelve.
Offseason.
After the end of the 2005 season, the Redskins were reported to be $20 million over the salary cap. However, due to the NFL and NFL Players' Union agreement the salary cap was raised to $102 million and LaVar Arrington paying $4.4 million of his salary back, Washington managed to get under the cap.
The Redskins released 3-time Pro Bowl linebacker LaVar Arrington and starting safeties Ryan Clark and Matt Bowen.
The Redskins signed the following free agents: wide receiver Antwaan Randle El, defensive end Andre Carter, strong safety Adam Archuleta, and tight end Christian Fauria. They also traded draft picks for wide receiver Brandon Lloyd, quarterback Todd Collins and running back T. J. Duckett
In the 2006 NFL draft, the Redskins did not have a first round pick due to a 2005 trade used to acquire quarterback Jason Campbell. However, they traded up in the second round to draft linebacker Rocky McIntosh out of the University of Miami, who was slated to be the replacement for Arrington. The Redskins then used their next pick on Minnesota DT Anthony Montgomery. The rest of their picks included Northern Colorado Safety Reed Doughty, Georgia DT Kedric Golston, Arizona Guard Kili Lefotu, and Tennessee LB Kevin Simon (who was later cut).
The Redskins finished the 2006 preseason with a record of 0–4, losing to the Cincinnati Bengals 19–3, the New York Jets 27–14, the New England Patriots 41–0 and the Baltimore Ravens 17–10. Starting running back Clinton Portis was injured in the first game of the preseason. The Redskins scored the fewest points of any team in the preseason.
The Redskins severed long-standing ties with radio station WJFK-FM for broadcasting rights to Redskins games. The new flagship station is Triple X ESPN Radio, which consists of three simulcast frequencies that cover the greater Washington, D.C. area.
Regular season.
Week 1: vs. Minnesota Vikings.
"at FedExField, Landover, Maryland"
The Redskins started the regular season against the Minnesota Vikings at home on September 11, in the first game of an ESPN "Monday Night Football" doubleheader on opening weekend. The Redskins defense allowed Minnesota quarterback Brad Johnson and the Vikings' offense to convert often on third down, and the Vikings won the game 19–16 after a failed field goal attempt by John Hall late in the fourth quarter quieted any chance of a Redskins comeback. With the loss, the Redskins were 0–1.Stats
Week 2: at Dallas Cowboys.
"at Texas Stadium, Dallas, Texas"
The Redskins traveled to Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas to take on one of their NFC East rivals, the Dallas Cowboys in a Sunday night match-up. The Redskins trailed early, as Dallas kicker Mike Vanderjagt completed a 26-yard field goal and Drew Bledsoe completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton in the first quarter. In the second quarter, kicker John Hall would get Washington a 39-yard field goal, but Dallas responded with RB Marion Barber's 1-yard TD run. RB Rock Cartwright would return a kickoff 100 yards for a TD, but that would be the last time in the entire game that Redskins would score a single point. Even though there wouldn't be a single point scored in the third quarter, the Cowboys sealed the win with a 40-yard TD pass to WR Terry Glenn and a 50-yard field goal by Vanderjagt. With the loss, the Redskins dropped to 0–2. Stats
Week 3: at Houston Texans.
"at Reliant Stadium, Houston, Texas"
The Washington Redskins defeated the Houston Texans by the score of 31–15. Washington quarterback Mark Brunell set a new NFL record for consecutive completed passes in one game by completing his first 22 pass attempts against the Texans' defense. Brunell finished 24 of 27 passes for 269 yards and one touchdown. Newly signed Redskins receiver Antwaan Randle El scored his first touchdown of the season. Clinton Portis rushed for 89 yards and two touchdowns. Ladell Betts finished with 124 rushing yards and one touchdown. With their first win of the season, the Redskins moved to 1–2.Stats
Week 4: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars.
"at FedExField, Landover, Maryland"
The Redskins welcomed Byron Leftwich and the rest of the Jacksonville Jaguars to FedExField. Mark Brunell passed for 329 yards, three touchdown passes (all to WR Santana Moss), and one interception. The Redskins came up with 153 total rushing yards, as Clinton Portis led the team with 112 rushing yards and one touchdown. The defense forced one interception from Leftwich, logged four sacks, and allowed only 33 rushing yards. John Hall was 3 for 3 on field goals and extra points. The game ended in overtime when Brunell threw a 68-yard game-winning touchdown pass to Moss. With the win, the Redskins moved to 2–2.Stats
Week 5: at New York Giants.
"at Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey"
Mark Brunell and the Redskins marched into Giants Stadium with a victory in mind. It ended up being misery within three hours, as they lost to a team who, at the time, had a poorly rated defense. Clinton Portis rushed for 76 yards. Santana Moss caught 3 receptions for only 39 yards, while Chris Cooley beat out Santana Moss with 4 receptions for 41 yards. Total offense for the Redskins was 164 yards, while the New York Giants put up 411 yards. The Redskins defense ended up with no sacks, interceptions, or turnovers. John Hall was 1/2 on field goals with no PATs. With another loss, the Redskins dropped to 2–3. Stats
Week 6: vs Tennessee Titans.
"at FedExField, Landover, Maryland"
Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Giants, the Redskins returned home for a Week 6 fight with the Tennessee Titans. In the first quarter, Washington trailed early as Tennessee kicker Rob Bironas kicked a 32-yard field goal. RB Clinton Portis got a 10-yard TD run to help the Redskins regain the lead. In the second quarter, the Skins increased their lead with QB Mark Brunell completing a 24-yard TD pass to TE Chris Cooley. However, the Titans regained the lead with Bironas nailing a 26-yard field goal and QB Vince Young completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Jones. In the third quarter, the Redskins continued to dig themselves a huge hole, as RB Travis Henry got a 2-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Titans got a safety on a blocked punt that rolled out the back of the end zone. In the fourth quarter, Washington tried valiantly to fight back, as Portis got a 4-yard TD run, but in the end, Bironas got a 30-yard field goal for Tennessee and a late interception by Free Safety Lamont Thompson killed any chance of a comeback. With the loss, the Redskins fell to 2–4. Stats
Week 7: at Indianapolis Colts.
"at the RCA Dome, Indianapolis, Indiana"
The Redskins started the game looking to prevent Peyton Manning from overwhelming their defense, and hoping to drive the ball in a more effective manner. What was a close game at the half however quickly degenerated into a blood bath in the 3rd quarter as Peyton Manning connected on 3 touchdown passes to seal the deal. Overall, the offense again looked confused, and surprisingly it was the defense of the Redskins that ended up giving up big running plays on a regular basis. With the loss, the Redskins dropped to 2–5 for the season. Stats
Week 9: vs. Dallas Cowboys.
"at FedExField, Landover, Maryland"
Coming off their Bye Week, the Redskins avenged their Week 2 loss by defeating the Dallas Cowboys after a wild final minute of the fourth quarter which ended with a game-winning 47-yard field goal by kicker Nick Novak. With less than a minute left in the fourth quarter, Novak missed from 49 yards. With nine seconds left Dallas kicker Mike Vanderjagt's field goal was blocked by newly signed Redskins cornerback Troy Vincent, and recovered by Redskins free safety Sean Taylor, who ran the ball down to the Dallas 45-yard line as time expired. During the runback by Taylor, Dallas offensive lineman Kyle Kosier grabbed his facemask and pulled it, adding an additional fifteen yards to the play and, since the penalty was defensive in nature, extended regulation by one additional play as a period cannot end on a defensive penalty according to NFL rules. Novak then came back out to hit the game winner and give the Redskons their third win of the year.Stats
Week 10: at Philadelphia Eagles.
"at Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia"
In their first game against the Eagles, the Redskins lost in convincing fashion, 27–3. Although they dominated the time of possession in the first half and had several long drives, they came away with only three points. On the other hand, the Eagles had several big plays which resulted in scores, including a second half interception for a touchdown. With the loss the Redskins fell to 3–6.Stats
On the Monday after this game, it was announced that quarterback Mark Brunell was being benched in favor of second-year quarterback Jason Campbell.
Week 11: at Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
"at Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, Florida"
New starting quarterback Jason Campbell played his first game at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Only field goal points took the first half, with both teams tied at halftime 3–3. In the second half Jason Campbell threw a three-yard touchdown pass to TE Chris Cooley, then Bruce Gradkowski threw a three-yard touchdown pass intended for Galloway but instead bounced off him into Becht's hands, making the game tied in the third quarter 10–10. Though the Redskins performed fairly well in the fourth quarter, Jason Campbell throwing another touchdown pass to Yoder, the Buccaneers had already pulled ahead by ten points. The final score was 20–17, Bucs, dropping the Redskins to 3–7. Stats
Week 12: vs. Carolina Panthers.
"at FedExField, Landover, Maryland"
In his first game at home as the starter for the Redskins, Jason Campbell, again, had an encouraging game completing 11 of 23 passes for 118 yards and two touchdowns.

In the second half Jason Campbell threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Antwaan Randle El and the Redskins took the lead at 10–6. In the fourth quarter Steve Smith scored on an 8-yard pass from Jake Delhomme to give Carolina a 13–10 lead.

In the first quarter, Washington struck first with kicker Shaun Suisham nailing a 31-yard field goal. However, the Eagles struck back with QB Jeff Garcia getting a 10-yard TD pass to TE L.J. Smith.

In the third quarter, Washington started to come back with Suisham kicking a 32-yard field goal, while QB Jason Campbell completed a 34-yard TD pass to WR Antwaan Randle El.

Li Jinhui

Li Jinhui (; 5 September 1891 – 15 February 1967 although some sources suggest he died 1968) was a Chinese composer and songwriter born in Xiangtan, Hunan, Qing China. He created a new musical form with shidaiqu after the fall of the Qing Dynasty—moving away from established musical forms. The Nationalist government attempted to ban Li's music. Critics branded his music as "Yellow Music", a form of pornography, because of its sexual associations and he was branded a "corruptor" of public morals. This kind of music was banned in China after the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949, and Li was eventually hounded to his death, a victim of political persecution in 1967 during the height of the Cultural Revolution.
Early years.
Born into a scholarly family in Xiangtan, Hunan, Li Jinhui was the second oldest of the renowned eight Li brothers. His older brother Li Jinxi was a linguist and acquaintance of Mao Zedong, and his youngest brother Chin Yang Lee (Li Jinyang) later became an author in the US.
Li grew up studying the Confucian classics and attending progressive schools like Shaoshan and Xiangtan. In total he had 8 brothers, including Li Jinxi. One of the earliest instruments Li studied was the guqin.
During his teenage years, he became fascinated with Chinese folk music, which he later incorporated into his revolutionary new musical style. Even as a student at Changsha Normal High School, Li's musical aptitude was apparent; the teen served as a musician, choir director, and part-time music instructor before he graduated in 1911.
Career.
After a brief stint in Beijing working as the new National Assembly's secretary from 1911 to 1914, Li returned to his native Hunan to direct other student choirs. Li's burgeoning career began in a dramatic way. He wrote several satirical political songs for a Changsha newspaper, but one such song so angered a local warlord that Li received a beating for it.
Li decided in 1916 to move back to Beijing, where he became involved in the New Culture Movement centered at Peking University. He participated in the May 4th Movement of 1919. In Beijing, Li also delved deeper into his lifelong pursuit of his two passions: the pedagogy of language and folk music. A Mandarin Chinese and music teacher, Li spent his time writing textbooks about effective classroom language instruction and exploring many musical genres. He was inspired by the Hunanese flower-drum opera, which is performed over a stage theatre monologue. Because of this, it can be said that the very first inspirations of Chinese popular music are derived from these forms.
As the head of the division of Peking University's Institute for the Promotion and Practice of Music focused on Hunan music, Li began adapting, transcribing, and performing regional Chinese folk songs to celebrate and reach the common people of China. However, Li's efforts were shunned by his colleagues because he failed to focus on the European Romantic music which was in vogue at the time or on traditional musical forms like the kunqu opera. Instead Li focused on the folk songs, which were considered to be “vulgar” and common.
In 1920, Li organized the Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe, the name of which Li derived from the New Culture Movement's rhetoric; Li described the focus of his musical endeavors, declaring, “we raise a banner of a ‘music for the common people,’ like the bright moon in the sky, shining across the land for all the people to enjoy". In that same year, Li also became the editor of the "Common People’s Weekly Magazine", and the next year became an editor at the China Book Bureau, and the following year was promoted to be the principal of the National Language Institute in Shanghai.
Also in 1922, Li began editing the children's magazine "Little Friend", which soon became the nation's best selling periodical. In "Little Friend", Li promoted anti-feudalist attitudes, national use of Mandarin Chinese, family values, sharing, harmony with nature, and good citizenship through nursery rhymes and children's operas. The songs were stripped down to just the melody, written in simplified notation, and they fused Chinese instrumentation with guitars, violins and pianos.
Though Li's early work is completely innocent and educational in content, it still met with disapprobation from some critics despite its immense popularity. This resistance may be due to the manner in which these songs were performed. Beginning in 1923, Li's broke the taboo of not allowing women to perform on stage when he hired young girls to sing and dance in his school musical productions, including "The Sparrow and the Child" and "The Little Painter". Even more controversial was his decision to allow his own daughter, Li Minghui, to perform. Minghui grew to become a singer, actress and child film star, but she was also brutally criticized for her public performances due to the traditional distrust of entertainers as “tawdry and shameful”. In 1927 he organized the "Chinese Dance School" () and then the "Chinese Song and Dance Troupe" ().
Although Li was forced to disband the Bright Moonlight group due to pressure from the Kuomintang (KMT) and financial troubles, he established the Beauty School for Girls in 1928 so that he could continue to work with a group of his pupils. After a financially unsuccessful tour with his girls, Li released a wildly popular album called "Family Love Songs" and later released "Patriotic Songs" in 1932. Armed with the success of his first album, Li reconstituted the Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe in 1929 and toured around the country. The tour began mostly as political squeeze due to the National Revolutionary Army during the Northern Expedition. When he was situated at Singapore, that was when his "period song" compositions began. The style would have some western influence and it moved Chinese music to a new direction. Those period songs would then be labeled as shidaiqu.
As radio became more widely accessible, so then did Li's jazz, for which he received vicious criticism as “Yellow (or pornographic) Music.” One 1934 reviewer said of Li that he is “vulgar and depraved beyond the hope of redemption…[but] as popular as ever”. His greatest source of Jazz influence came from American Buck Clayton who worked with Li for two years. Clayton played a major role in shaping the musical scores written by Li. Li's revolutionary Chinese jazz music dominated the nightlife scene, and it was performed at cabarets, cafes and nightclubs around southeast Asia. Li himself led the first all-Chinese jazz band, which played at an upscale Shanghai nightclub. Li's songs were often performed by different “song-and-dance troupes” composed of female singers and male musicians, many of whom had formerly been members of Li's groups. Among the stars who came to prominence due to Li's efforts were Wang Renmei, Nie Er, and Zhou Xuan. Zhou Xuan would later become one of the Seven great singing stars of the Republic of China.
In 1931, Li's troupe merged with the Lianhua Film Company. Li began writing music for films like "Romance at the Dancehall", one of China's first musical talkies. Li's music began to be associated with the urban mass marketing of the female image, and an obsession with stardom and commercialism. By 1934, the musical and star-driven movement he began progressed without him. In 1949 he was a composer for the Shanghai Animation Film Studio. Li continued to compose music the rest of his life, though he would eventually pay dearly for his fame. Classified as a founder of Yellow Music by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), he became a victim of political persecution during the Cultural Revolution.
Personal life.
In 1930, Li married Xu Lai, a member of the Bright Moon Troupe. She gave birth to a daughter named Xiaofeng. In 1933, Xu Lai became a movie star with the Mingxing Film Company. Their marriage broke down after the sudden death of Xiaofeng in 1935, and the couple divorced in November that year. Li was devastated by the loss of his daughter and wife. It was an acrimonious divorce and he requested compensation from Xu Lai for the investment he had made in training her. Xu later married Kuomintang general Tang Shengming and worked as a Juntong secret agent during the Second Sino-Japanese War.
Li Jinhui had a daughter, Li Minghui (1909–2003), from an earlier marriage. She is considered China's first pop singer, performing songs written by Li Jinhui.
Li also adopted Qian Zhenzhen, the daughter of Qian Zhuangfei, a legendary CCP secret agent. She changed her name to Li Lili, and became one of the most famous Chinese actresses of the 1930s.
Legacy.
Though a controversial figure in his time, Li Jinhui contributed hundreds of songs to the musical community released by many major recording companies, including Great China, Pathe-EMI and RCA-Victor. He also discovered and catapulted into stardom some of Shanghai's most famous recording artists and actress during the late 1920s to 1940s. In his lifetime, critics derided his work as "Yellow Music" because of its sexual associations. His work was labeled pornographic and was accepted only by select groups. His music movement would later grow into the cantopop and mandopop phenomenon, which became the main genre of music in Hong Kong and Taiwan respectively in the 20th century.

Virginia State Route 61

State Route 61 (SR 61) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs from SR 16 in Tazewell east to U.S. Route 460 (US 460) in Narrows. SR 61 passes through several narrow creek valleys as it parallels the West Virginia state line through Tazewell, Bland, and Giles counties. The only sizeable community between the highway's endpoints is Rocky Gap, where the highway meets US 52 and Interstate 77 (I-77).
Route description.
SR 61 begins at an intersection with SR 16 in the North Tazewell neighborhood of the town of Tazewell. SR 16 continues west along Riverside Drive and south as Tazewell Avenue, which heads into the downtown area. SR 61 parallels the Clinch River east through a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with US 19 and US 460 to the neighborhood of Fourway. There, SR 61 turns south, meets a Norfolk Southern Railway rail line at grade, and crosses the North Folk Clinch River. Just south of the river, just east of the confluence of the North and South forks to form the main river, the state highway intersects US 19 Business and US 460 Business (Fincastle Turnpike).
SR 61 leaves the town of Tazewell and curves to the east to follow the South Fork Clinch River through the Clinch Valley between Buckhorn Mountain to the north and Rich Mountain to the south. The state highway passes through the hamlet of Burtons Shop on its way to the source of the South Folk just west of the Tennessee Valley Divide in the community of Gratton, where the highway intersects SR 623 (Burkes Garden Road), which leads over Rich Mountain to Burkes Garden. SR 61 continues east along Clear Fork through the community of Shawver Mill and enters Bland County. The state highway continues east as Clear Fork Creek Road, which passes through Cove Creek, Stowersville, and Clear Creek on the way to Rocky Gap. SR 61 has a short concurrency with US 52 (Scenic Highway), during the road briefly expands to a four-lane divided highway through a diamond interchange with I-77. The two highways make a sharp turn north, then split in the center of the village where Clear Fork enters Wolf Creek.
SR 61 continues east as Wolf Creek Road through the valley of Wolf Creek between Buckhorn Mountain to the north and Wolf Creek Mountain to the south. The highway passes through Round Bottom then enters Giles County. SR 61 passes through the tiny communities of Day, Phlegar, First Ford, Boxley, Chapel, Penvir, and Shumate on their way to Narrows. The state highway enters the town as Park Drive, crosses Wolf Creek, and continues as Monroe Street. North of its intersection with SR 100 (Main Street), SR 61 continues as McArthur Lane, which passes under a Norfolk Southern rail line and crosses over the New River and US 460 (Virginia Avenue). The state highway turns east onto Fleshman Street and turns south to reach its eastern terminus at an intersection with US 460.

2006 Minnesota Vikings season

The 2006 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 46th in the National Football League (NFL). Under new head coach Brad Childress, the team finished with a 6–10 record; however, they led the league in rushing defense, surrendering only 985 rushing yards; they are one of only two franchises in NFL history to allow fewer than 1,000 rushing yards in a 16-game season (the other was the Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens in 2000).
Offseason.
On January 6, 2006, the Vikings hired Brad Childress to take over from Mike Tice as head coach, making them the first team to hire a new head coach during the 2006 offseason. Childress previously held the quarterbacks coach position with the Philadelphia Eagles from 1999 to 2002, and was the offensive coordinator from 2002 to 2005; he was also offensive coordinator for the Wisconsin Badgers from 1993 to 1999 under Barry Alvarez.

Game summaries.
Week 1: at Washington Redskins.
The Vikings started the regular season on the road against the Washington Redskins on September 11, the first game of a "Monday Night Football" doubleheader on opening weekend. The Vikings drew first blood as running back Chester Taylor ran in a 4-yard touchdown on their opening drive; however, during the extra-point try, holder Chris Kluwe fumbled the snap and instead tried to go for a two-point conversion, which failed. The Vikings lead was cut in half later in the quarter, as Redskins kicker John Hall made a 27-yard field goal. In the second quarter, things were starting to look grim for the Vikings, as Redskins running back Clinton Portis and kicker Hall gave the Redskins a 5-yard touchdown run and another 27-yard field goal to make the score 13–6. The Vikings responded with a last-second 46-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Longwell to close the first half. In the third quarter, the Vikings continued their comeback as quarterback Brad Johnson threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marcus Robinson to give Minnesota a 16–13 lead. However, the Redskins tied the game up on a 22-yard field goal by Hall. Late in the fourth quarter, Longwell gave the Vikings a 19–16 lead, as he kicked a 31-yard field goal. During the final minute of the game, the Vikings held their ground and hung on to give Brad Childress his first head coaching win, as Hall missed a 48-yard field goal for the home side.

The Vikings fell to their doom, as Chester Taylor fumbled and the Bears quarterback Rex Grossman completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Rashied Davis, which gave the Vikings their first loss of the year. Of the first five games played by the Bears in the 2006 season, this was the closest game. All others have been decided by at least 26 points.
Week 4: at Buffalo Bills.
Hoping to rebound from the previous week's loss, the Vikings traveled to Ralph Wilson Stadium for a match-up with the Buffalo Bills. In the first quarter, the Vikings drew first blood as kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 37-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, Minnesota got into a tiny hole, as Bills running back Willis McGahee got a 1-yard touchdown run. Longwell gave the Vikings a 49-yard field goal as time ran out of the first half, but in the third quarter, the Vikes found themselves in a bit of a hole, as Buffalo quarterback J. P. Losman connected with wide receiver Peerless Price on an 8-yard touchdown pass for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota trailed even further, as Bills kicker Rian Lindell got a 28-yard field goal. The Vikings tried to come back, as quarterback Brad Johnson completed a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marcus Robinson. The two-point conversion failed and during their next drive, they ran out of time. With their loss, the Vikings fell to 2–2.
Week 5: vs. Detroit Lions.
After dropping two straight games, the Vikings came home for an NFC North fight with the Detroit Lions. The Vikings struck first with a 26-yard field goal, which were the only points scored in the first quarter. The Vikings did not score again until the fourth quarter. Detroit got close, but Napoleon Harris got the first interception of his five-year career at the end of the first. In the second quarter, Detroit quarterback Jon Kitna ran 8 yards to score a touchdown, putting the Lions ahead 7–3. Detroit's next drive resulted in a field goal to put them ahead 10–3. In the third quarter, Detroit recovered a Vikings fumble and then go on to score another touchdown to bring their lead to 17–3. In the first minute of the fourth quarter, the Vikings' Travis Taylor scored a touchdown on a three-yard reception to bring the score to 17–10. The Lions' next drive ended in a forced fumble when Pat Williams burst through the line untouched and Kitna lost the ball, which was picked up by the Vikings' Ben Leber in the end zone for a touchdown; however, the extra point was blocked, leaving the score at 17–16. With a 4th-and-1 for the Vikings on the Lions' 34, kicker Ryan Longwell pooch-punted the ball to the Lions' 7. Later, the Vikings scored a 20-yard field goal to take the lead at 19–17. Detroit then threw an interception on 4th-and-10 to E.J. Henderson, who ran 45 yards to score a touchdown, bringing the score to 26–17. The Vikings' Darren Sharper got an interception in the last minute to seal the victory, bringing the Vikings' record up to 3–2.
Week 7: at Seattle Seahawks.

In the fourth quarter, the Seahawks had Brown kick a 26-yard field goal. The Vikes pulled away and won with defensive tackle Kevin Williams recovering a Seattle fumble in their endzone. With the win, Minnesota improved to 4–2.
Week 8: vs. New England Patriots.
The Vikes fell to 4–3 with a loss at home on "Monday Night Football" to the New England Patriots.
The Pats, who came out passing instead of bothering to even try challenging the Vikings rush defense, got out to an early lead on the opening drive as quarterback Tom Brady hit wide receiver Reche Caldwell for a 6-yard touchdown pass. Kicker Stephen Gostkowski connected on a 23-yard field goal early in the second quarter. Brady threw his second of what turned out to be four touchdown passes, this time to tight end Benjamin Watson just before halftime to give the Pats a 17–0 lead. The Vikes finally got on the board as running back Mewelde Moore returned a punt 71 yards for a touchdown early in the third quarter. That was all the Vikings could muster as Brady threw his final two touchdowns to wide receivers Troy Brown and Chad Jackson respectively to close out the scoring.
Week 9: at San Francisco 49ers.
Hoping to rebound from their disappointing home loss to the Patriots, the Vikings flew to Monster Park for a Week 9 clash with the San Francisco 49ers. In the first quarter, the Vikings scored first, as kicker Ryan Longwell completed a 21-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the 49ers get two Joe Nedney field goals (a 25-yarder and a 30-yarder) and take the lead.

Week 10: vs. Green Bay Packers.
Trying to end their two-game skid, the Vikings flew home for an NFC North fight with the Green Bay Packers. In the first quarter, the Vikings trailed early as Packers kicker Dave Rayner nailed a 20-yard field goal, while quarterback Brett Favre completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to running back Noah Herron. In the second quarter, the Vikes took the lead as quarterback Brad Johnson completed a 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Billy McMullen. Afterwards, McMullen recovered a fumble within the Packers end zone for another touchdown. However, Green Bay retook the lead with Favre completing an 82-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donald Driver. In the third quarter, Rayner helped the Packers with a 24-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Rayner kicked one more field goal for Green Bay, as he kicked a 29-yard field goal. Minnesota tried to fight back, but all they could get was kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 34-yard field goal. With their third-straight loss, the Vikings fell to 4–5.
Week 11: at Miami Dolphins.
Trying to stop a three-game skid, the Vikings flew to Dolphin Stadium for an interconference fight with the Miami Dolphins. In the first quarter, the Vikes struck first with running back Chester Taylor getting a 1-yard touchdown run for the only score of the period. However, in the second quarter, the Dolphins took the lead with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 44-yard field goal, while quarterback Joey Harrington completed an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Justin Peelle. In the third quarter, Minnesota tied the game with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 35-yard field goal. Afterwards, in the fourth quarter, Longwell kicked a 19-yard field goal to help the Vikings retake the lead. However, Miami's defense made some huge stops on the Vikes, with free safety Renaldo Hill returning a fumble 48 yards for a touchdown, while defensive end Jason Taylor returned an interception 51 yards for a touchdown. The only response that Minnesota could muster was on the final offensive play of the game, as Taylor got another 1-yard touchdown run. With their fourth-straight loss, the Vikings fell 4–6.
Week 12: vs. Arizona Cardinals.
Hoping to end their four-game skid, the Vikings returned home for a Week 12 fight against the Arizona Cardinals. This game was notable for the return of Head Coach Dennis Green, who formerly coached the Vikings and now works for the Cardinals. Right out of the gate, the Vikes trailed early as Cardinals running back J. J. Arrington returned the opening kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings responded with running back Chester Taylor getting a 1-yard touchdown run. In the second quarter, Cards kicker Neil Rackers helped increase Arizona's lead with a 21-yard and a 50-yard field goal. Afterwards, Minnesota struck back with quarterback Brad Johnson completing a 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marcus Robinson. In the third quarter, the Vikings took the lead with Johnson completing a 9-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Billy McMullen, while kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 40-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Vikes managed to put the icing on the game with Johnson completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to fullback Jeff Dugan.

Minnesota held on to snap its four-game losing streak. With the win, the Vikings improved to 5–6.
Week 13: at Chicago Bears.
Trying to build on their win over the Cardinals, the Vikings flew to Soldier Field for an NFC North rematch with the Chicago Bears. After a scoreless first quarter, the Bears drew first blood in the second quarter with defensive back Devin Hester returning a punt 45 yards for a touchdown. Afterwards, Minnesota had kicker Ryan Longwell nail a 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Longwell kicked a 30-yard field goal, but that was as close as the Vikings got to Chicago in the game, because after Longwell's field goal, the Bears took over with defensive back Ricky Manning, Jr. returning an interception 54 yards for a touchdown, while running back Cedric Benson got a 24-yard touchdown run. By the time the fourth quarter came around, quarterback Brad Johnson was benched for the game, due to throwing four interceptions. Back-up quarterback Brooks Bollinger took over, but he fare any better, as he got sacked in his own end zone by defensive tackle Tank Johnson for a safety. Afterwards, the Vikings had their only successful drive of the game with running back Ciatrick Fason getting a 4-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, Bollinger sprained his left arm during a sack, so rookie quarterback Tarvaris Jackson came in to finish the game. With the loss, Minnesota fell to 5–7.
Week 14: at Detroit Lions.
After getting swept by the Bears, the Vikings flew to Ford Field for an NFC North rematch with the Detroit Lions. In the first quarter, running back Artose Pinner (a former Lion) helped Minnesota gain an early lead with a 3-yard and a 4-yard touchdown run. In the second quarter, quarterback Brad Johnson got a 3-yard touchdown run, yet it was followed up with a failed two-point conversion. Detroit retaliated with defensive back Jamar Fletcher returning an interception 88 yards for a touchdown, while kicker Jason Hanson kicked a 53-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikes got a 30-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Longwell, yet Detroit's Hanson nailed a 45-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Pinner helped wrap the game up with a 1-yard touchdown run. Even though Lions quarterback Jon Kitna completed a 23-yard touchdown pass to running back Kevin Jones, Minnesota held on to sweep Detroit. With the win, the Vikings improved to 6–7.
Week 15: vs. New York Jets.
Following their win over the Lions, the Vikings went home for a Week 15 interconference fight with the New York Jets. In the first quarter, the Vikes took an early lead with quarterback Brad Johnson completing a 30-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Travis Taylor. However, the Jets struck back with running back Cedric Houston with a 6-yard touchdown run. In the second quarter, things got bad for Minnesota. First, New York got a 25-yard field goal from kicker Mike Nugent. Then, quarterback Chad Pennington completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Laveranues Coles. Afterwards, Nugent kicked a 52-yard and a 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Jets' lead increased with Nugent's 20-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, rookie quarterback Tarvaris Jackson came in a completed a 35-yard touchdown pass to running back Mewelde Moore. That was the only response from the Purple People Eaters. With the loss, the Vikings fell to 6–8.
Week 16: at Green Bay Packers.
Trying to keep their slim playoff hopes alive, the Vikings flew to Lambeau Field for an NFC North rematch with the Green Bay Packers in a Thursday night fight. For this game, Minnesota gave rookie quarterback Tarvaris Jackson the start. In the first half, the Packers took an early lead as kicker Dave Rayner nailed a 38-yard field goal in the first quarter and a 44-yard field goal in the second quarter. In the third quarter, the Vikes took the lead with cornerback Fred Smoot returning an interception 47 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Rayner gave Green Bay the win with a 44-yard field goal. With the loss, not only did the Vikings fall to 6–9, but they also got eliminated from the NFC playoff race.
A huge cause for Minnesota's loss was that the offense was only able to get three first downs the entire game. Also, in keeping with the fact that the Vikings were the most penalized team in the league in 2006, they committed 10 penalties for a loss of 68 yards.
Week 17: vs. St. Louis Rams.
Trying to end their season on a high note, the Vikings went home for a Week 17 intraconference fight with the St. Louis Rams. In the first quarter, Minnesota trailed early as Rams defensive back Ronald Bartell returned an interception 38 yards for a touchdown. Also, kicker Jeff Wilkins helped St. Louis with a 42-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Vikings managed to score with quarterback Tarvaris Jackson getting a 1-yard touchdown run. However, in the second quarter, things got worse for the Vikes as Rams running back Steven Jackson got a 4-yard touchdown run and even a 10-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Marc Bulger. In the third quarter, things continued to get worse for Minnesota as Wilkins kicked a 53-yard field goal, while Jackson got a 2-yard touchdown run. In the fourth quarter, St. Louis wrapped up its domination with Jackson with a 59-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, the Vikes got its remaining points with running back Chester Taylor getting a 1-yard touchdown run, while Tarvaris Jackson completed a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Travis Taylor. With three straight losses to close out the season, the Vikings finished at 6–10.

Randolph Bresnik

Randolph James "Komrade" Bresnik (born September 11, 1967) is a retired officer in the United States Marine Corps and an active NASA astronaut. A Marine Aviator by trade, Bresnik was selected as a member of NASA Astronaut Group 19 in May 2004. He first launched to space on STS-129, then served as flight engineer for Expedition 52, and as ISS commander for Expedition 53.
Biography.
Bresnik was born in Fort Knox, Kentucky, but considers Santa Monica, California, to be his hometown.
Bresnik graduated from Santa Monica High School in Santa Monica, California, in 1985. He then earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from The Citadel in 1989, and later a Master of Science degree in Aviation Systems from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville in 2002. He then graduated from the Air War College in 2008. Randy is the first graduate of The Citadel to fly in space.
Bresnik's family includes his wife, Rebecca Burgin of Pompton Plains, New Jersey, a son, and a daughter who was born while he was in orbit during STS-129. This marked the second time a space traveler became a parent while on orbit; it first happened when Franz Viehböck's daughter was born while he was in space in 1991. Bresnik's wife Rebecca has worked at NASA as acting associate general counsel of its International, Space and National Security Law Group. His father is Albert "Randy" Bresnik, a pilot himself, serving in the Vietnam War and later in domestic duties. His grandfather, Albert Louis "Al" Bresnik, was Amelia Earhart's photographer.
Marine Corps.
In May 1989, Bresnik received his commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps from the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps at The Citadel. After graduation he attended The Basic School (TBS) and Infantry Officers Course (IOC) at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. Following Aviation Indoctrination and Primary flight training in Pensacola, Florida, he entered Intermediate and Advanced flight training in Beeville, Texas, and was designated a Naval Aviator in 1992.
Bresnik then reported to the Navy Fighter/Attack Training Squadron VFA-106, Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida, for initial F/A-18 training. Upon completion of training, he reported to Marine Fighter/Attack Squadron, VMFA-212 at Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, then MCAS El Toro, California, and additionally MCAS Miramar, California, where he made three overseas deployments to the Western Pacific. While assigned to VMFA-212, he attended the Marine Corps Weapons and Tactics Instructors Course (WTI) and Naval Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN).
Bresnik was selected for the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS) at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, and began the course January 1999. After graduation in December 1999, he was assigned as an F/A-18 Test Pilot/Project Officer at VX-23, the Naval Strike Aircraft Test Squadron (NSATS). While at Strike, Bresnik flew the F/A-18 A-D and F/A-18 E/F in all manners of flight test.
In January 2001, he returned to the USNTPS as a Fixed-Wing and Systems Flight Instructor, where he instructed in the F/A-18, T-38 Talon, and T-2 Buckeye. Bresnik returned to NSATS in January 2002 to continue flight test on the F/A-18 A-F as the Platform/Project Coordinator.
In November 2002, he reported to Marine Aircraft Group 11 (MAG-11) as the Future Operations Officer. In January 2003, MAG-11 deployed to Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait. From Al Jaber, he flew combat missions in the F/A-18 with VMFA(AW)-225 in support of Operation Southern Watch and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Bresnik was the Operations Officer of VMFA-232 when he was selected for the astronaut program.
Bresnik has logged more than 6,000 hours on 81 different aircraft.
During his military service he was awarded: Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, Strike/Flight Air Medal (3), Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Combat "V" (3), Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (3), Presidential Unit Citation and various other service awards.
NASA career.
Bresnik was selected by NASA in May 2004 as an astronaut candidate. He was one of two pilots chosen in the Astronaut Class of 2004. In February 2006, he completed Astronaut Candidate Training.
Bresnik participated in the first analogue ESA CAVES mission in September 2011, staying underground and exploring the caves for 6 days, simulating Mars mission technologies.
On June 10, 2014, NASA announced that Bresnik would command the undersea exploration mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, which began on September 7, 2014, and lasted seven days. Bresnik was the lead astronaut assigned to the closeout crew for the final STS-135 launch in the Shuttle program.
Spaceflight experience.
STS-129.
In September 2008 NASA announced that Bresnik was assigned as Mission Specialist STS-129, a shuttle mission to the International Space Station. The mission was then slated to launch in October 2009 aboard Space Shuttle "Discovery", although this was later pushed back to November 2009 aboard Space Shuttle "Atlantis".
Bresnik and his five crew mates launched from the Kennedy Space Center on November 16, 2009, ahead of an approximately two day rendezvous with the ISS, following which the crew joined the Expedition 21 crew, Commanded by Belgian ESA astronaut Frank De Winne. The main objective of STS-129 was to deliver and install the first two of four ExPRESS Logistics Carriers (ELCs) to the ISS. ELCs are exposed pellets installed on the outboard truss of the ISS intended to support vacuum capable payloads such as scientific experiments built for operations on the outside of the station or for holding spare parts.
Bresnik participated in the second and third EVA of STS-129. On November 21, 2009, Bresnik stepped outside the station with veteran spacewalk Michael Foreman, the two spent six hours and eight minutes outside of the ISS installing a piece of equipment called the Grappling Adapter to On-Orbit Railing (GATOR) on the European "Columbus", installing a wireless video system on the outside of the station and setting up a cargo attachment system. Bresnik's second spacewalk took place on November 23, 2009, and was alongside NASA astronaut Robert Satcher. Satcher and Bresnik spent five hours and 42-minutes outside the station installing a similar cargo attachment system to the one on the last spacewalk, but on the opposite side of the station, installing the MISSE-7 experiment and transferring a high pressure gas tank.
STS-129 returned to Earth on November 27, 2009, returning Bresnik and his five crew mates, as well as Expedition 21 flight engineer Nicole Stott from the ISS.
Expedition 52/53.
 Bresnik launched aboard Soyuz MS-05 to the ISS on July 28, 2017, and served as flight engineer for Expedition 52, and as ISS commander for Expedition 53.
On October 5, 2017, Bresnik performed his third spacewalk, along with Mark Vande Hei. The spacewalk replaced the gripping mechanism on Canadarm2, the latching end effector A, or LEE-A. Spacewalk duration was 6 hours and 55 minutes. On October 10, 2017, Bresnik and Vande Hei completed the second EVA of the mission. They lubricated the newly installed end effector and replaced cameras, and the duration was 6 hours and 26 minutes. On October 20, 2017, Bresnik and Joe Acaba performed an EVA to continue with the lubrication tasks, and to install more cameras. The duration was 6 hours and 49 minutes.
Bresnik returned to Earth on December 14, 2017. The Soyuz MS-05 landed on 8:38 UTC. The duration of the mission was 138 days, 16 hours, 56 minutes and 37 seconds.

On 23 November, Jacobson joined Accrington Stanley on loan. On 7 January Stanley announced the loan had been extended until 29 January with an option to extend until the end of the season. The following day he scored his first goal for the club as they beat Bury 1–0. On 31 January 2011, he signed for Stanley on a permanent basis, helping them to achieve a playoff place.
Shrewsbury Town.
Following the expiration of his Accrington contract, on 28 June 2011 it was announced that Jacobson would join Shrewsbury Town on a two-year deal. In an interview he told reporters: "it's the place I wanted to be." Joe made his first appearance for Shrewsbury Town in a 2–0 home win against Crewe Alexandra
 and scored his first goal as a Shrewsbury player in a 7–2 away win against Northampton Town. In the 2011–12 season he made 45 appearances for Shrewsbury Town in all competitions establishing himself as first-choice left-back with manager Graham Turner and securing promotion to League One. In the 2012–13 season, he was selected as captain in the absence of Matt Richards as Shrewsbury confirmed their League One status in a 0–0 draw away at Colchester United on 20 April 2013. He retained this role for the final two matches of the season, also scoring in both, against Oldham Athletic and Portsmouth.
By playing an undisclosed number of matches for Shrewsbury Town, Jacobson triggered a clause in his contract to earn another year, extending his stay to the end of the 2013–14 season. Following Shrewsbury's relegation, Jacobson was released at the end of his contract.
Wycombe Wanderers.
On 1 July 2014, Jacobson signed a two-year contract with Wycombe Wanderers following his release from Shrewsbury Town. In the 2015 League Two play-off final, Jacobson's free kick was deflected into his own net by Southend United's goalkeeper Daniel Bentley to open the scoring. He later scored a penalty in the shootout, but Wycombe lost on penalties. He scored his first career hat-trick with a free kick and two direct corners in a 3–1 win over Lincoln City. In 2016 he was selected in League Two's PFA Team of the Year. In November 2019 he received the League One Player of the Month Award. In the 2020 League One play-off final, Jacobson scored the winning goal from the penalty spot as the club reached the Championship for the first time. In July 2020 Jacobson was in discussions about extending his contract with Wycombe. Jacobson was awarded the 'Players' Player' award in May 2021, voted for by the playing squad. During the 2022 season, Jacobson has been the captain for the Wanderers. Having been defeated 2–0 by Sunderland in the 2022 EFL League One play-off final, Jacobson was offered a new contract at the end of the 2021–22 season. Near the end of the 2023–24 season, it was confirmed that he would leave Wycombe at the end of his contract. He made his 400th and final appearance for Wycombe in a 1–0 victory against Charlton Athletic, retiring soon afterwards. 
International career.
Jacobson represented Great Britain at the 2001 Maccabiah Games in Israel at the age of 14.
Jacobson captained the Wales Under-21 side that beat France and Romania until narrowly losing over two legs to England U21 in the 2009 European Championship play-offs in October 2008. John Toshack named him in the senior squad for several friendlies but he did not make his debut for the senior team.
Honours.

Christopher Cassidy

Christopher John "Chris" Cassidy (born January 4, 1970) is a retired NASA astronaut and United States Navy SEAL. He achieved the rank of captain in the U.S. Navy. His first spaceflight was on a Space Shuttle mission in 2009. He was the Chief of the Astronaut Office at NASA from July 2015 until June 2017.
Early life and education.
Cassidy was born in Salem, Massachusetts on January 4, 1970. He attended York High School, in York, Maine. He then graduated from the Naval Academy Preparatory School in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1989. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics at the United States Naval Academy in 1993 and a Master of Science degree in ocean engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2000.
Military experience.

NASA career.
Cassidy was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in May 2004. In February 2006 he completed Astronaut Candidate Training, which included scientific and technical briefings, intensive instruction in Space Shuttle and International Space Station systems, physiological training, T-38 Talon flight training, and water and wilderness survival training. Completion of this initial training qualified him for various technical assignments within the Astronaut Office and future flight assignment as a mission specialist.
STS-127.
In February 2008, Cassidy was assigned to his first spaceflight as a mission specialist on STS-127, a Space Shuttle mission to deliver the Exposed Facility of the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EF) to the ISS aboard Space Shuttle "Endeavour".
Cassidy and his six fellow crew members lifted off aboard "Endeavour" from the Kennedy Space Center on July 15, 2009. The seven astronauts docked with the ISS on July 17, joining the six-person Expedition 20 crew commanded by Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka. This marked the first time that 13 people had been in space together, a record that has not been surpassed since. On July 22, 2009, Cassidy stepped outside the ISS with NASA astronaut David Wolf for his first spacewalk. The two began work replacing batteries on the P6 Truss and continued work on installing the JEM-EF. The EVA was called off after 5 hours and 59 minutes for excess carbon dioxide in Cassidy's suit.
Over the course of STS-127, Cassidy participated in two more spacewalks with NASA astronaut Thomas Marshburn. The two completed replacing the batteries on the P6 truss and completed the installation of the JEM-EF during two excursions lasting 7 hours and 12 minutes and 4 hours and 57 minutes, respectively. Cassidy's third spacewalk marked the completion of the Japanese Experiment Module, a feat that took three space shuttle missions starting with STS-123.
On July 31, 2009, Cassidy returned to the KSC Shuttle Landing Facility, wrapping up his first spaceflight after 15 days in space.
Expedition 35/36.
Cassidy was assigned to the Expedition 35 crew as a flight engineer and flew to the ISS aboard Soyuz TMA-08M ("US designation: 34S"), which launched on March 28, 2013. On May 11, 2013, Cassidy and Thomas Marshburn performed an unplanned spacewalk to replace a pump controller box suspected to be the source of an ammonia coolant leak.
Cassidy participated in two US spacewalks from the ISS in June/July 2013. On July 16, 2013, he was joined by Luca Parmitano on a spacewalk. The EVA was cut short when Parmitano reported water floating behind his head inside his helmet. During the EVA, Cassidy took his space selfie. That photo became one of the best selfies of 2013 listed by many news sites.
Chief of the Astronaut Office.
Cassidy was named Chief of the Astronaut Office at NASA in July 2015, succeeding Bob Behnken.
On June 2, 2017, Cassidy was replaced by Patrick G. Forrester as Chief of the Astronaut Office and was returned to normal flight status.
Expedition 62/63.
Cassidy launched onboard Soyuz MS-16 on April 9, 2020, as part of Expedition 62. He was the ISS commander for Expedition 63, which consisted of Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Ivan Vagner and Anatoli Ivanishin. Cassidy was joined by fellow NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken on May 31, 2020, with the docking of Crew Dragon Demo-2. Cassidy and his crew returned to Earth on October 21, 2020. They landed in Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan at 10:54 pm.
Cassidy's last two years as an astronaut were the central feature of the Disney+ docuseries "Among the Stars". The series was removed from Disney+ on May 26, 2023, amidst the Disney+ and Hulu purge.
Post-NASA career.
Cassidy joined the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation as President and CEO in August 2021 after retiring from the Navy and the NASA Astronaut Corps earlier that year. Since his retirement from government service, Cassidy has also been active on the boards of directors for several non-profits, including the Navy SEAL Foundation and the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. He also serves as an advisor for New Vista Acquisition Corp, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC).
Awards and honors.
Cassidy was awarded the Bronze Star with "V" device and the Presidential Unit Citation for leading a nine-day operation at the Zhawar Kili cave complex, a national priority objective directly on the Afghan–Pakistan border, during Operation Enduring Freedom. Cassidy was a guest speaker at the USNA Combat Leadership Seminars in 2003 and 2004. He was awarded a second Bronze Star for combat leadership service in 2004 during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.
Chris Cassidy is also the 500th person in space. He achieved this when his crewmates so designated him during the STS-127 mission. He is also the second SEAL to fly in space, following William Shepherd, a veteran of four missions.
Personal life.
Cassidy is married to the former Peggy Yancer from Elyria, Ohio. They have five children between the two of them. Recreational interests include traveling, biking, camping, snow skiing, weight lifting, running, basketball, real estate, and home improvement.
Cassidy is a licensed amateur radio operator (ham), holding U.S. Technician level license KF5KDR. Cassidy has participated in several Amateur Radio on the International Space Station events with students in the United States.
Cassidy announced his retirement from both the Navy and NASA Astronaut Corps on May 28, 2021.

Circus Joseph Ashton

Circus Joseph Ashton, formerly trading as Ashton's Circus, is the longest-surviving circus in Australia, pre-dating most others in the English-speaking world. 
The circus was founded in Hobart, Tasmania, in 1847 by Thomas Mollor, and acquired in February 1850 by James Henry Ashton, a man schooled in the tradition of English circus and who had experienced the hard times of the nineteenth century. The circus operated as the Royal Amphitheatre or Royal Circus.
Ashton's at its height, had more than 180 personnel and 80 animals and thousands of dollars worth of equipment, and toured internationally in New Zealand and Papua New Guinea
When founder James Henry Ashton died in 1889, his son Fred, then aged 22, inherited the circus. The circus continued to be handed down throughout the family, and today it is run by the 6th generation of Ashtons, Michelle and Joseph and their sons, Jordan and Merrik. As Joseph had founded 'Circus Joseph Ashton' in 1998 prior to his grandfather's retirement in 2000, it was decided to apply this name to the family's main circus reflecting the current state of ownership and operations. The prior name of "Ashton's Circus" was therefore retired.
Circus Joseph Ashton travels mainly in South Australia and Western Australia.
The company employed Tommy Hanlon Jr., after his career in television
Other circuses and entertainment businesses run by other members of the Ashton family include Ashton Entertainment, Infamous the Show, Lorraine Ashton's Classic Circus, and Circus Xsavia.

Satoshi Furukawa

 is a Japanese surgeon and JAXA astronaut. Furukawa was assigned to the International Space Station as a flight engineer on long-duration missions Expedition 28/29 (2011) and Expedition 69/70 (2023-2024).
Medical career.
Furakawa graduated from Eiko high school, Kamakura, in 1983; he received a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Tokyo in 1989, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Medical Science from the same in 2000.
From 1989 to 1999, Furukawa worked in the Department of Surgery at the University of Tokyo, as well as the Department of Anesthesiology at JR Tokyo General Hospital, the Department of Surgery at Ibaraki Prefectural Central Hospital, and at Sakuragaoka Hospital.
NASDA/JAXA career.
In February 1999, Furukawa was selected by the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) as one of three Japanese astronaut candidates for the International Space Station (ISS). He started the ISS Astronaut Basic Training program in April 1999 and was certified as an astronaut in January 2001.
Since April 2001, he has been participating in ISS Advanced Training, as well as supporting the development of the hardware and operation of the Japanese ISS Experimental Module "Kibō".
On October 1, 2003, NASDA merged with ISAS (Institute of Space and Astronautical Science) and NAL (National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan) and was renamed JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency).
In May 2004, he completed Soyuz-TMA Flight Engineer-1 training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC), Star City, Russia.
Furukawa arrived at the Johnson Space Center in June 2004. In February 2006 he completed NASA Astronaut Candidate Training that included scientific and technical briefings, intensive instruction in Shuttle and International Space Station systems, physiological training, T-38 Talon flight training, and water and wilderness survival training. Completion of this initial training qualified him for various technical assignments within the NASA Astronaut Office and for flight assignment as a mission specialist on Space Shuttle missions.
In August 2007, Furukawa served as an aquanaut during the project, an exploration research mission held in Aquarius, the world's only undersea research laboratory.
In 2013, Furukawa served as cavenaut into the ESA CAVES training in Sardinia, alongside Jeremy Hansen, Michael Barratt, Jack Fisher, Aleksei Ovchinin, and Paolo Nespoli.
Spaceflight experience.
Furukawa was assigned as a flight engineer to the International Space Station Expedition 28/29 long duration missions. The Soyuz TMA-02M spacecraft carrying Furukawa, cosmonaut Sergey Volkov and NASA astronaut Michael Fossum lifted off from the Baikonour Cosmodrome on 7 June 2011. Carrying the same crew, Soyuz TMA-02M undocked from the ISS at 11:00 pm UTC on 21 November 2011. The spacecraft soft-landed safely—albeit on its side—in Kazakhstan at 2:26 am UTC on 22 November.
In 2023-2024, he completed a second long-duration flight to the ISS as a mission specialist on Expedition 69/70, lifting off on the Crew-7 mission of a SpaceX Crew Dragon on 26 August 2023 from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida and returning to Earth on 12 March 2024.
Controversies.
In 2016 and 2017, Furukawa was overseeing a two-week-long spaceflight analog mission in Tsukuba, a city northeast of Tokyo. 40 participants were confined to closed environments to simulate what astronauts experience during spaceflight, and their stress levels and mental well-being were to be assessed by two researchers. The researchers fabricated research data, compiling psychological assessments without actually conducting interviews and rewriting participant diagnoses. They also claimed that three researchers had conducted the interviews when there were only two. In November 2020, JAXA began investigating the research results and subsequently suspended the 190 million yen ($1.4 million) experiment. Furukawa was officially reprimanded by JAXA due to his role as project supervisor. However, since he was not personally involved in fabricating the data, Furukawa was allowed to remain on the current ISS mission in 2023.
Personal.
Furukawa was born in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. He enjoys baseball, bowling, music, and traveling. He is married and has two children.

Edin Džeko

Edin Džeko (; born 17 March 1986) is a Bosnian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Serie A club Fiorentina and captains the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team. He is the all-time top goalscorer and most capped player of the Bosnian national team. Džeko was named Bosnian Footballer of the Year for three years in a row. He has been nicknamed "the Bosnian Diamond" () or simply "Diamond" ("Dijamant") by football fans and journalists in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Prior to joining Fiorentina, he played for Manchester City, Roma, Inter Milan and Fenerbahçe, but he made a name for himself while playing for German club VfL Wolfsburg, with whom he won the Bundesliga in the 2008–09 season. He was the second-highest goalscorer with 26 goals. In the 2009–10 season, Džeko was the top scorer with 22 goals. He also registered ten assists in both seasons. During the 2011–12 Premier League season, Džeko scored four goals in one game for Manchester City against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. On the final day of that season, he scored an equaliser against Queens Park Rangers in the 92nd minute, before Sergio Agüero won it for City with seconds to go, ensuring the team won a league title for the first time in 44 years. Džeko finished as the top scorer of Serie A in the 2016–17 season, scoring 29 goals for Roma. On 3 March 2018, he scored his 50th league goal for the club, thus becoming the first player ever to score 50 goals in three of Europe's top five major leagues.
A former youth international for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Džeko made his senior international debut in 2007, earning over 140 caps and scoring over 65 goals since. Džeko became the highest Bosnia and Herzegovina goalscorer of all time on 7 September 2012 in a game against Liechtenstein, scoring a hat-trick to surpass Zvjezdan Misimović and Elvir Bolić. On 11 September 2018, in a game against Austria, he played his 95th game for Bosnia and Herzegovina and surpassed Emir Spahić to become the country's most-capped player. His ten goals in the qualifying campaign helped his national team qualify for its first international tournament, the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
Club career.
Early career.
Džeko began his career at Željezničar, playing as a midfielder between 2003 and 2005, but with little success playing in that position. He was widely regarded as too tall, and with poor technical abilities. Džeko's coach at the time though, Jiří Plíšek, saw his potential and when Plíšek returned home, he advised Teplice to buy him. Željezničar accepted a bid of just €25,000 for Džeko, one of Željezničar's directors saying years later, "[we] thought we won the lottery".
Džeko had a loan spell with Ústí nad Labem in 2005, during which he scored six goals in 15 games. Later that year, he moved back to Teplice, staying there until 2007. With 13 goals in 30 games, he was the second-top goalscorer of the Czech League in the 2006–07 season. Due to his performances, VfL Wolfsburg manager Felix Magath signed him for €4 million.
VfL Wolfsburg.
After moving to Wolfsburg, Džeko scored five goals and recorded three assists in his first 11 games: he was named by "Sportal" as the best striker in the first half of the 2007–08 Bundesliga season. During his first season in Germany, Wolfsburg finished in fifth place, qualifying for a UEFA Cup spot for the following season. Džeko finished the 2007–08 season with eight goals and seven assists in 17 games started.
After Wolfsburg acquired fellow Bosnian international Zvjezdan Misimović in July 2008, Džeko's performances improved significantly. During the first half of the 2008–09 Bundesliga season Džeko scored five goals and added seven assists, but after the winter break he added 21 goals and three more assists. This upturn was especially visible during their ten-game winning streak from 7 February to 26 April, in which he scored 11 goals and added an assist. In May 2009 Džeko scored a hat-trick against Hoffenheim, and did so again two weeks later against Hannover 96, contributing 26 goals and 10 assists overall in 32 league matches. His goal tally was second only to teammate Grafite, with whom he formed the most successful strike duo in Bundesliga history; Misimović, the team's main assist and key pass provider, himself broke a longstanding Bundesliga record for assists by setting up 20 goals, the three players becoming known as "the magic triangle". Wolfsburg ended the season as Bundesliga champions for the first time in the club's history; they finished two points clear of Bayern Munich, the key match being the meeting between them on the 26th matchday which finished 5–1, Džeko and Grafite scoring two goals each in an impressive performance (the latter added his second and the team's fifth with a memorable dribble and backheel). At that point Wolfsburg, in third at the start of the day, gained the lead in the table for the first time and retained the position for the rest of the season to take the title.
In the DFB-Pokal, Džeko scored six goals in two matches, and in the UEFA Cup, four goals and two assists in eight matches. These performances resulted in him being given the Bundesliga "Players' Footballer of the Year" award. Despite attracting interest from A.C. Milan Džeko decided to stay, renewing his contract until June 2013.
He scored his first UEFA Champions League goal on 30 September 2009 against Manchester United in a 2–1 defeat at Old Trafford. He was one of 30 players nominated for the 2009 Ballon d'Or. He was the Bundesliga top scorer in the 2009–10 season with 22 goals.
On 28 August 2010, Džeko became the top league scorer in Wolfsburg's history with 59 goals in 96 appearances, surpassing Diego Klimowicz who scored 57 in 149 games. At the winter break stage of the 2010–11 Bundesliga season, Džeko had scored 10 goals in 17 matches.
Manchester City.
After heavy speculation, Roberto Mancini, manager of Manchester City, confirmed on 3 January 2011 that a fee of £27 million (€32 million) had been agreed with Wolfsburg for Džeko, which was City's second highest transfer figure, after Robinho's £32.5 million (€42.5 million) move from Real Madrid in 2008. The transfer fee was the sixth highest in the Premier League history at the time. Also, the sum broke the Bundesliga record departure transfer fee, Bosnian record transfer fee, as well as that of any player from former Yugoslavia at the time. The previous ex-Yugoslav record stood for more than a decade – the transfer fee paid by Real Madrid to Fenerbahçe for Elvir Baljić in 1999 (€26 million). In August 2014 he signed a new four-year deal with the club, taking his contract up to 2018.
2010–11 season.
Following his medical examination in London, he travelled to Manchester on 5 January, and on 7 January, Džeko was confirmed as a Manchester City player, joining the club on a four-and-a-half-year deal.
He made his debut for the club in a 4–3 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on 15 January in which he set up Yaya Touré for the third goal of the match. Džeko marked his FA Cup debut on 30 January 2011 with the equalising goal in Manchester City's fourth round match against Notts County which ended in a 1–1 draw. In the replay on 20 February, Džeko again scored, helping Manchester City progress to the next round with a 5–0. Džeko scored twice against Aris Thessaloniki within four and a half minutes at the Etihad Stadium in the second leg of the last 32 of the UEFA Europa League on 24 February 2011.
On 25 April 2011, Džeko scored his first Premier League goal with a right footed finish against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. This was the only goal of the game in a 1–0 win for Manchester City
His last goal was against Bolton Wanderers on the final day of the season and guaranteed City third place in the Premier League over Arsenal and automatic qualification into the group stage of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League.
On 14 May 2011, Džeko was an unused substitute in Manchester City's 1–0 win over Stoke City the 2011 FA Cup Final, winning his first trophy with the club.
2011–12 season.
Džeko started his second season with City by scoring the team's second goal in a 2–3 defeat against Manchester United in the FA Community Shield. In his third Premier League game of this season, Džeko scored four goals against Tottenham. In this game, Džeko broke another record by becoming the first Manchester City player to score four goals in one Premier League match. His tally of six league goals in three games won him the Premier League Player of the Month award for August.
Further on, he grabbed some important goals such as a header against Wigan Athletic that sealed a 1–0 win for City and extended their lead over title rivals Manchester United to three points, and a goal that put Manchester City 2–0 up against Porto in the Europa League, as they won 6–1 on aggregate. He also scored a headed goal against Blackburn Rovers, which put Manchester City 3–0 up, and sealed the game, this subsequently maintained City's narrow two-point margin over Manchester United.
Bosnia and Herzegovina national manager Safet Sušić urged Džeko to leave City at the end of the season because of lack of first-team football towards the end of the season, with the likes of Juventus and Bayern Munich interested. On the final day of the season, Džeko scored a 92nd-minute equaliser before Sergio Agüero scored in the 94th minute to beat Queens Park Rangers 3–2 and secure the Premier League title, the club's first in 44 years. Following his goal that helped win the championship, his 19th goal and 40th appearance in all competitions, Džeko's agent denied reports that the striker would leave City saying it was all media speculation.
2012–13 season.
Džeko began the new 2012–13 season with an equalising goal against Southampton in a 3–2 win. He scored another goal against Queens Park Rangers taking his tally to two goals in the opening three games. He then scored the first goal of City's Champions League campaign against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu. On 29 September, he scored an 87th-minute winner away at Fulham, one minute after appearing as a substitute. On 20 October, he came off the bench in the 79th minute to score a minute later. He scored a second goal two minutes into stoppage time to seal a comeback win for 10-man City against West Bromwich.

Roma.
After months of speculation during the 2015 summer transfer market, Džeko officially signed for Serie A outfit Roma on 12 August 2015, on a €4 million loan with an €11 million option to buy that would become mandatory after certain performance related goals were met. These clauses were activated on 1 October 2015, making Džeko a permanent member of Roma.
2015–16 season.
He made his Serie A debut ten days after his move from Manchester City, playing the entirety of a 1–1 draw at Hellas Verona, and in his second appearance on 30 August, he scored the winning goal in the 79th minute to defeat reigning champions Juventus 2–1 at the Stadio Olimpico. On 21 February 2016, he scored his first brace for Roma, scoring the first and last goals in a 5–0 win over Palermo.
2016–17 season.
After a relatively disappointing first season with the club, in which Džeko scored only 8 Serie A and 10 goals in all competitions for Roma, he started the 2016–17 season with 12 goals in 15 games, 17 goals in 20 overall, thus equaling the start of the season that Gabriel Batistuta had, in which he won the league title with Roma. On 24 November 2016, he scored a hat-trick in the Europa League, in a 4–1 win over Viktoria Plzeň. On 16 February 2017, he also scored a hat-trick in the first leg of a Europa League match against Villarreal, which Roma won 4–0. On 12 March 2017, he became the fourth Roma player to reach 30 goals in all competitions in a season.
On 1 April 2017, Džeko became the first Roma player ever to reach 33 goals in a season in all competitions, surpassing the previous record of 32 goals jointly held by Rodolfo Volk and Francesco Totti. He ended the season with a tally of 39 goals in all competitions of which his 29 goals in Serie A made him the Capocannoniere for that season becoming the first Bosnian player to do so.
2017–18 season.
Džeko started his third season at the Roman club with six goals in first five league games. He scored his first goal of the season against Inter Milan on 26 August 2017, which Roma lost 1–3. In the next two games, he scored two braces, against Verona and Benevento. He continued his goalscoring form by opening the score against A.C. Milan on 1 October, in a 2–0 win away at San Siro.

Džeko then scored a brace against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 19 October. The game ended in a 3–3 draw. His next big game of the season came against Napoli, in which he scored a brace and helped his team to a 4–2 victory. Džeko also helped Roma reach UEFA Champions League quarter-finals by scoring the winning goal against Shakhtar Donetsk. Džeko was instrumental in Roma's qualification to UEFA Champions League semi-finals, their first in over 30 years. He scored in both quarter-final legs against Barcelona, which Roma won on away goals. In the semi-finals, Džeko scored in both legs, but it wasn't enough, as Roma were eventually eliminated by Liverpool 6–7 on aggregate. Džeko ended the season with 24 goals, 16 of which he scored in Serie A, making him club's best goalscorer in the league and joint sixth overall. He also added 8 goals in Champions League, which meant he ended as competition's fifth best goalscorer.
2018–19 season.
Džeko started his fourth season with Roma by scoring a winning goal away at Torino on 19 August. Džeko scored his first UEFA Champions League hat-trick on 2 October when he again put three past Viktoria Plzeň, in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League group stage.

In a game against Cagliari on 6 October 2019, Džeko fractured his zygomatic bone (cheekbone), needing to go get surgery and afterwards wear a protective mask in some of his first games after the recovery. He scored his 5th goal in the season for Roma in the club's 2–1 home league win against Milan on 27 October 2019. With a goal in a UEFA Europa League game against Wolfsberg on 12 December 2019, which Roma drew 2–2, Džeko helped his team qualify for the last 16 of the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League season.

Inter Milan.
2021–22 season.

Later that day, Inter announced that he had signed a two-year deal. He scored his first goal for the club in a 4–0 win against Genoa.
In his first season with the club, he scored 13 goals in 36 Serie A matches, and totally 17 goals and assisted 10 more in all competitions in 49 matches.
2022–23 season.
On 4 January 2023, Džeko scored the only goal of the match against championship leaders Napoli, giving them their first league defeat for the 2022–23 season. Fourteen days later, he scored in the 3–0 win over Milan in the 2022 Supercoppa Italiana and was named Man of the Match; with this goal he became the oldest goalscorer (36 years and 307 days) of the competition, breaking the previous record set by Cristiano Ronaldo (35 years and 350 days) in 2020.
On 10 May 2023, Džeko scored a volley in a 2–0 win over Milan in the Champions League semifinals, and in doing so at the age of 37 years and 54 days, he became the second oldest player to score in the semifinals of the UCL, after Ryan Giggs (37 years and 148 days in April 2011). On 3 June 2023, Džeko played his 100th Inter match in all competitions in a 1–0 away win over Torino in the last matchday of Serie A. On 10 June, he was in the starting eleven in Inter's UEFA Champions League final against his former side Manchester City. Džeko was substituted for Romelu Lukaku in the 57th minute.

International career.
Džeko's first appearance for his home country came with the Bosnia and Herzegovina national under-19 football team. He was also part of the under-21 team who played in the play-offs for UEFA European Under-21 Championship hosted by the Netherlands in 2007. Bosnia's first challenges in this competition were Armenia under-21 and Norway under-21. They beat Armenia 3–2 and drew with Norway 1–1, qualifying for the playoff against the Czech Republic under-21. In the first leg, Bosnia lost 2–1; in the second, the game ended in a 1–1 draw. Džeko scored one goal in the tournament.
He made his senior debut against Turkey on 2 June 2007. It was a memorable debut for the player, scoring a volleyed goal during the first half stoppage time. The goal levelled the score at 2–2 and Bosnia went on to win 3–2.
On 28 March 2009, Bosnian sports commentator, Marjan Mijajlović, named Džeko "the Bosnian Diamond" during a game versus Belgium in Genk in which he scored a remarkable goal.
He scored nine goals in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying and finished as the second highest goalscorer in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, tied with England's Wayne Rooney, behind Greek striker Theofanis Gekas' 10 goals.
On 8 September 2012, in an 8–1 win over Liechtenstein, Džeko scored his first hat-trick for the national team and at the same time became the leading goal scorer in the history of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team with 24 goals. The record was previously held by Elvir Bolić who scored 22 goals.
Džeko ended the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign as second-top scorer with ten goals as Bosnia and Herzegovina qualified for the first major tournament in its history.
In June 2014, Džeko was named in Bosnian squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He debuted in the team's opening group match, a narrow defeat to Argentina at the Maracanã Stadium. On 25 June with the team already eliminated, in the final group match against Iran, Džeko scored the opening goal to help Bosnia and Herzegovina to their first ever FIFA World Cup win.
In August, following the retirement of Emir Spahić from the international team, manager Safet Sušić named Džeko the new captain.
On 28 March 2015, Džeko netted his second international hat-trick, scoring all of the goals in a 3–0 away win over Andorra in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying, their first win in five games of the qualification campaign.
On 13 November 2016, Džeko had an altercation in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Greece with Greek player Kyriakos Papadopoulos, in which he pulled down Sokratis Papastathopoulos' shorts while trying to obtain the ball. The subsequent fight between the two teams saw both Džeko and Papadopoulos sent off. It was his first red card in the national jersey.
On 28 March 2017, Džeko became the first Bosnian player to score 50 international goals. On 23 March 2019, he made his 100th appearance for Bosnia in a 2–1 win over Armenia in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers.
On 14 June 2022, by playing against Finland in a 2022–23 UEFA Nations League B game, Džeko became his country's oldest player at 36 years and 2 months, beating Samir Muratović's record. On 7 September 2024, by scoring a goal against the Netherlands in an 2024–25 UEFA Nations League A game, he became Bosnia and Herzegovina's oldest goalscorer at 38 years and 5 months, surpassing Emir Spahić's record.
On 7 June 2025, Džeko scored the only goal in a 1–0 win over San Marino in the 2026 World Cup qualification, becoming at 39 years, 2 months and 21 days UEFA’s oldest goalscorer in a FIFA World Cup qualification game, beating the record of Andorran Marc Pujol.
Style of play.
Džeko is renowned for his physical presence, strength and aerial ability. Considered by pundits and managers to be one of the best strikers in Europe at his peak, although he is mainly known for his goalscoring abilities, he is also a generous player, who has a penchant for providing a good number of assists in addition to scoring many goals. He is also known for shooting the ball with both feet equally well. Wherever he played, he posted impressive goalscoring records, playing mainly as a striker. His former Roma manager Luciano Spalletti once described him as the "perfect prototype" of a striker, noting that he is "strong, tall, fast for his height, combative, aggressive and has good technique." In his youth, he also played as a midfielder, and as a winger.
During his time with Manchester City, he was considered a "super-sub", as he scored many important goals coming off the bench, a label which he himself rejected on several occasions. In retrospective, Džeko is now often described, by his peers and experts alike, as one of the most underrated players in recent history, whose career is too often overlooked in discussions and considerations by football writers and pundits.
Personal life.
Džeko was born in Sarajevo, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, at that time part of SFR Yugoslavia, to Midhat and Belma Džeko. He stated that his family was always supportive throughout his career, especially his father, who took him to training sessions while he was at Željezničar. His father also played professionally in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Džeko is considered a local superstar in Sarajevo.
Džeko was six years old when the Siege of Sarajevo began, lasting for the next three years. His family home was destroyed, and 15 family members had to live in his grandparents' apartment that measured 35 square metres. He continued to play outside in the neighbourhood of Otoka; on a rare occasion that his mother forbade him to play outside, a missile killed several children on the local football pitch.
Džeko is multilingual, speaking five languages fluently: Bosnian, Czech, German, English and Italian. He is a Muslim, and has dual citizenship of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Džeko stated that Milan has always been his favourite club, although he played two seasons for city rivals Inter Milan, and Andriy Shevchenko his favourite player. Džeko is a first cousin of former fellow national team player and captain Emir Spahić.
In November 2009, Džeko became Bosnia's first UNICEF ambassador. He has since visited schools and children in his home country affected by the Bosnian War. On 6 July 2012, Džeko was accepted to the University of Sarajevo to study sport and physical education. On 10 September 2018, he graduated with a bachelor's degree.
Džeko has been in a relationship with model and actress, Amra Silajdžić since 2011, marrying her in 2014. They have three daughters and a son.

Pako Ayestarán

Francisco Martín "Pako" Ayestarán Barandiarán (born 5 February 1963) is a Spanish football manager and coach. He is currently the assistant head coach at Premier League club Aston Villa.
Ayestarán was assistant manager to Rafael Benítez at Valencia and Liverpool. After parting ways with Benítez in 2007, he became a head coach in his own right, managing clubs in Mexico, Israel, Spain, and Portugal. He led Maccabi Tel Aviv to a domestic treble in 2015.
Early life and education.
Ayestarán was born in Beasain, Gipuzkoa, and played youth football at Real Sociedad. He studied physical activity and sport sciences, later earning a master's degree in high-performance training from the Spanish Olympic Committee and becoming a licensed UEFA Pro coach. 
After starting his career as a fitness coach, he was appointed Rafael Benítez's assistant at Osasuna, and remained behind the manager at Extremadura, Tenerife, Valencia and Liverpool. 
Coaching career.
Valencia.
In 2001, Ayestarán followed Rafael Benítez to Valencia, joining as assistant manager. The club won two La Liga titles (2001–02 and 2003–04) and the 2003–04 UEFA Cup.
Liverpool.
In 2004, he moved to Liverpool as assistant manager. There, Ayestarán modernized the team’s fitness regime, introducing data-driven methods, individualized recovery programs, and the “Pako Hills” training slopes at Melwood. Steven Gerrard called him “the perfect number two,” while Peter Crouch remarked “Pako ran the show,” crediting him as one of the best coaches he had worked with. During his time at the club, Benítez won the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, 2005 UEFA Super Cup, 2005–06 FA Cup, 2006 FA Community Shield, and a runner-up finish in the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League.
On 1 September 2007, Ayestarán announced his departure from "the Reds" after 11 years partnering Benítez. Benítez accused Ayestarán of "betrayal" as Ayestarán "contacted other clubs behind his back" while Ayestarán rejected the accusations, claiming instead that Benítez "forgot his principles". 
During the summer of 2007, FC Barcelona expressed interest in adding him to their technical staff, though Liverpool initially blocked the move. He was also invited by Avram Grant to join his coaching staff at Chelsea, but Ayestarán declined the offer.
Real Sociedad.
After leaving Liverpool, Ayestarán was briefly appointed sporting director of Real Sociedad in January 2008, but resigned after a few weeks due to conflict with club president Iñaki Badiola.
Benfica and return to Valencia.
In the 2008–09 season, he served as fitness coach under Quique Sánchez Flores at Benfica in Portugal, where the club won the Taça da Liga. He returned to Valencia for the 2009–10 season as fitness coach under Unai Emery. Ayestarán left the club in June 2010, stating that he wanted to pursue other professional opportunities.
After a year out, he joined Sánchez Flores again for the 2011–12 season at Al-Ahli Dubai, where they won the UAE League Cup.
Estudiantes Tecos.
On 24 August 2013, Ayestarán took his first head coaching role at Estudiantes Tecos in Mexico. In May 2014, Tecos won the Clausura 2014 title under his management, defeating Correcaminos UAT on penalties. They went on to lose the promotion play-off to Leones Negros, and the franchise was later relocated to Zacatecas. Ayestarán chose not to continue with the team, stating he had no intention of remaining in the second division.
Maccabi Tel Aviv.
Ayestarán was appointed Maccabi Tel Aviv manager on 26 August 2014, replacing fellow Spaniard Óscar García, who had resigned due to the war in Gaza. During the 2014–15 season, Ayestarán led Maccabi Tel Aviv to a domestic treble—winning the Israeli Premier League, the Israel State Cup, and the Toto Cup after defeating Maccabi Haifa 2–1 in the final—becoming the first manager to win all three major domestic trophies in a single season in Israel.
Ayesterán resigned from the club on 20 August 2015. He was later linked with a return to Liverpool as assistant to Brendan Rodgers, but made clear he intended to continue as a head coach.
Santos Laguna.
On 19 August 2015, Ayestarán returned to Mexico, being appointed at the helm of Santos Laguna in Liga MX, replacing Portuguese coach Pedro Caixinha, who had resigned days earlier. Under his leadership, the team played 14 official matches across domestic and international competitions, including the CONCACAF Champions League, achieving 5 wins, 4 draws, and 5 losses, with 24 goals scored and 17 conceded, for an average of 1.36 points per match. Notable results included 0–3 away victories against Chivas and Veracruz, as well as a 6–1 home win over Deportivo Saprissa in continental competition. On 21 November 2015, it was announced that Ayestarán would not continue with the club for the Clausura 2016 tournament.
Return to Valencia (2016).
On 14 February 2016, Ayestarán returned to Valencia CF for a third spell, though for the first time not as a fitness coach but as a member of Gary Neville's coaching staff. His arrival marked a key addition to the backroom team, which also included Miguel Ángel Angulo and Phil Neville.
On 31 March 2016, following Neville’s dismissal, Ayestarán was appointed head coach for the remainder of the 2015–16 La Liga season. He began his tenure with a defeat to UD Las Palmas, but then won three consecutive league games over Sevilla, Barcelona, and Eibar. 
The club confirmed Ayestarán’s appointment as full-time manager on 24 May 2016, with a contract running until 30 June 2018. However, after a poor start to the 2016–17 campaign — with four league defeats, he was relieved of his duties on 20 September 2016.
Las Palmas.
Ayestarán replaced Manolo Márquez as the new Las Palmas manager on 27 September 2017. Taking over a struggling side early in the season, he managed seven league matches, recording one draw and six defeats, before being dismissed on 30 November 2017.
Pachuca.
On 29 May 2018, Ayestarán returned to Mexico's top flight as manager of Pachuca in Liga MX. During his time in charge, he led the team in 28 official matches, recording 13 wins, 7 draws, and 8 losses, with 55 goals scored and 42 conceded. Pachuca reached the semi-finals of the Copa MX Apertura 2018 and produced notable performances, including a 6–2 win over Club Necaxa and a 3–0 victory against Querétaro. He left the club on 20 January 2019 following a poor start to the Clausura tournament, which included a 3–0 loss to Club América at the Estadio Azteca.
Tondela.
On 10 August 2020, Ayestarán was appointed head coach of Portuguese Primeira Liga side Tondela, replacing fellow Basque Natxo González. In his first season, he led the club to its best-ever finish in the Primeira Liga, securing 12th place. The following year, he guided Tondela to the Taça de Portugal semi-finals for the first time in the club's history. In the first leg, they earned a 3–0 home victory over Mafra. Ayestarán departed the club on 16 March 2022, shortly before Tondela confirmed their place in the final with a 4–1 aggregate win.
Aston Villa.
On 4 November 2022, Ayestarán was announced as assistant head coach to Unai Emery at Aston Villa. 
Personal life.
Ayestarán is married and has three children: a daughter and two sons. His wife is from Lanzarote, where the family often spends holidays. They have lived in both Spain and England, and Ayestarán maintains a home on the Wirral, which he has described as a second home. He has stated that his son, who spent most of his childhood there, also considers England home.

In February 1999 Hoshide was selected by NASDA (now JAXA) as one of three Japanese astronaut candidates for the International Space Station (ISS). He started the ISS Astronaut Basic Training program in April 1999 and was certified as an astronaut in January 2001. Since April 2001, he has participated in ISS Advanced Training, as well as supporting the development of the hardware and operation of the Japanese Experiment Module Kibō and the H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV).
From 21 July 2014 to 29 July 2014 Hoshide commanded NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations Mission 18 (NEEMO 18) to the Aquarius Reef Base of the coast of Key Largo, Florida. He was joined by NASA astronaut Jeanette Epps and Mark Vande Hei as well as ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet during the nine-day mission.
In 2016 he served as part of the 2016 European Space Agency's Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behaviour and performance Skills (CAVES) expedition. Where he spent two weeks underground in caves alongside NASA astronauts Ricky Arnold and Jessica Meir, CNSA taikonaut Ye Guangfu, Roscosmos cosmonaut Sergei Korsakov and ESA astronaut Pedro Duque in order to simulate spaceflight conditions.
STS-124.
Hoshide's first mission was as mission specialist on board Space Shuttle "Discovery" for the STS-124 mission, which was the second of three missions to deliver the Japanese Experiment Module, nicknamed "Kibō", to the ISS. STS-124 launched on 31 May 2008 from the Kennedy Space Center on its mission to the space station.
"Discovery" and its crew docked to the International Space Station on 2 June 2008, beginning 8 days of operations to install the Japanese Experiment Module-Pressurised Module (JEM-PM). On Flight Day 4, NASA astronauts Mike Fossum and Ronald Garan performed a spacewalk to prepare the ISS and the JEM-PM for installation, during this Hoshide and fellow STS-124 Mission Specialist Greg Chamitoff robotically removed the module from "Discovery"s payload bay and moved it to its new home on the port the side of Node 2. The next day the STS-124 and Expedition 17 crews opened "Kibō" for the first time.
Hoshide and the STS-124 crew remained on the ISS until 11 June 2008, when "Discovery" undocked from the International Space Station and began its return to Earth, leaving Greg Chamintoff on board as a flight engineer on the Expedition 17 crew, and returning Expedition 17 Flight Engineer Garrett Reisman. On 14 June 2008, "Discovery" landed on the Shuttle Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center following 13 days, 18 hours, 13 minutes in space, officially ending the STS-124 mission.
Expedition 32/33.
In November 2009 Hoshide was assigned to the crew of ISS Expedition 32/Expedition 33 as a flight engineer. He started training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, and served on the backup crew for Expedition 30/31, which launched aboard Soyuz TMA-03M on 21 December 2011.
Following the launch of Expedition 30/31, Hoshide started training for his own flight, alongside Roscosmos cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko and NASA astronaut Sunita Williams. The trio launched onboard Soyuz TMA-05M on 15 July 2012 ahead of a two-day flight to the ISS. The three crewmembers arrived on board the ISS on 17 July 2012 and officially became members of the Expedition 32 crew, joining Russian Commander Gennady Padalka, Russian Flight Engineer Sergei Revin and NASA Flight Engineer Joe Acaba.
On 27 August 2012 Hoshide robotically captured and berthed JAXA's HTV-3 uncrewed cargo spacecraft, on 30 August he ventured outside the ISS alongside Williams for his first spacewalk, over the eight hour, 17-minute spacewalk, the two astronauts prepared a Main Bus Switching Unit (MBSU) for replacement on a later spacewalk and switched some cables on the Russian Orbital Segment ahead of the launch and docking of the future Nauka laboratory module. On 5 September he and Williams went outside the station again, for a 6-hour, 28-minute spacewalk to replace the MBSU the two had prepared for replacement on the last spacewalk. They also replaced a camera on Canadarm-2.
On 16 September 2012, Paldalka, Revin and Acaba departed the station onboard Soyuz TMA-04M, following which Hoshide, Williams and Malenchenko became part of the Expedition 33 crew, with Williams taking command of the station for the increment. They were later joined by Soyuz TMA-06M crewmembers Oleg Novitsky and Evgeny Tarelkin, both of Roscosmos, and NASA astronaut Kevin Ford. On 11 October 2012 Hoshide and Williams successfully robotically captured SpaceX's Cargo Dragon CRS-1 uncrewed resupply spacecraft, the first mission contracted under NASA's Commercial Resupply Services contract. On 1 November Hoshide stepped outside the station with Williams for a third time and performed a six-hour, 38-minute spacewalk to carry out several maintenance tasks on the US Orbital Segment of the station, during which Hoshide took hold of the record for most cumulative spacewalk time for a Japanese astronaut, at 21-hours and 23-minutes total.
Expedition 33 officially ended on 18 November 2012 with the undocking of Soyuz TMA-05M. Malenchenko, Williams and Hoshide safely landed approximately six hours after undocking near the remote town of Arkalyk, Kazakhstan following 127 days in space.
Expedition 65/66.
Hoshide launched into space for the third time in 2021 aboard SpaceX Crew-2. He served as a flight engineer on Expedition 65. On 27 April 2021, Hoshide assumed command of the ISS from NASA astronaut Shannon Walker, becoming only the second Japanese astronaut to command the station, following Koichi Wakata, who commanded Expedition 39 in 2014.

Silvers Circus

Silver's Circus was an Australian circus started by Mervyn King and entrepreneur David Hardie Snr. and his two sons Les and David Jnr.
History.
The original Silver's Circus was founded by Mervyn King and David Hardie Snr, Les Hardie and David Hardie Jnr, the Hardie family in Sydney NSW in 1946. 
The professional name of 'Silvers' was chosen for the circus, inspired by the neon sign King saw flashing one night outside a Sydney restaurant, The Silver Grill. King's circus expertise combined with the financial and technical support of the Hardies proved a winning combination. An official opening was given at Jude's Corner, Rockdale. King took the stage name of Alwyn Silver as 'there had to be a Mr Silver around the show' as Ring Master. Within five years, Silver's Circus was Australia's largest road show and toured every state of the Australian mainland. 
Silvers Circus became one of the most well organised, best looking and popular circuses in the country. It also was the first to cross the Nullarbor by road, then a corrugated dirt track full of potholes and bulldust. The company was dissolved at the peak of its success in 1953 but other companies revived the name of 'Silver' in years to follow.
King, an orphan, was given to St. Leons Circus at the age of seven. He spent his entire life performing in the ring and became one of the Australian Circus' best known animal trainers and acrobats. He started with a first class lion act and training show horses. When Silver's was sold in 1953, King admitted later that the sale was premature since TV didn't make much of an impact on Australian rural life until well into the 1960s. He saw television as a threat. Mervyn King had two sons. He died in 2003 at age 96.
Although it's not the original circus, the name Silver's Circus still travels Australia. It is run by Anton and Anna Gasser and has been since 1976.
Second incarnation.
In 1976, Anton and Anna continued Silvers Circus in Australia. Their three children Tony, Rosita and Dominik, have all followed in the family's footsteps to become circus artists. A two-hour TV spectacular was filmed in Sydney and was viewed by European and American audiences. Silvers was voted as "One of the best Ten Circuses in the world" in 1982. With artists continually arriving from all parts of the world, Silvers are proud of the ever-changing program they are able to present. Rosita and Dominik, along with their parents, still currently perform and direct Silvers Circus, whilst their eldest son, Tony, and his wife, Debbie, run a company called Unique Attractions.
Ross Skiffington was the creator, writer, director and ringmaster of Silver's Grand Magic Circus. Gordon Arnie was the set designer; Wendy Dalton, Sue McCrohon and Bruce Wood were assistant dancers. It was a theatrical presentation of grand illusions in a circus environment that played to more than 150,000 people in 10 months. It toured Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales and South Australia. It continues to this day.

Hurd (band)

Hurd (, , "speed") is a Mongolian rock band. Formed in 1987 as Skorost (, , also "speed") by drummer Dambyn Ganbayar, Hurd is considered the first band to have introduced the heavy metal genre into the Mongolian music landscape. Along with Chingis Khaan, Haranga or Niciton, they are considered "veterans" of the Mongolian pop rock scene, and, as such, they have greatly contributed to its diversification and encouraged the emergence of many new rock acts.
Hurd has released nine studio albums, one live album, one compilation album, two video albums and one box set. The band has won numerous Pentatonic Awards (Mongolia's equivalent of the Grammy Award) and Golden Microphone Awards. Guitarist Dambyn Otgonbayar is a member of the Pentatonic Academy.
Drummer Dambyn Ganbayar is a board member of the Mongolian Drummers Association.
In November 2009, singer Dambyn Tömörtsog and bassist Namsraijavyn Naranbaatar were respectively awarded with the Merited Artist of Mongolia and the Polar Star awards.
History.
Early years (1987–1995).
In 1987, drummer Dambyn Ganbayar founded his first rock band with his fellow workers of Ulaanbaatar's train depot. The formation was dubbed "Skorost" by the depot's director, but Ganbayar renamed the group to the Mongolian "Hurd". This early incarnation of Hurd won second place at the first Mongolian Pop and Rock Festival in 1989. As the members didn't really get along, this first line-up didn't last.
In 1991, lead guitarist Dambyn Otgonbayar joined Hurd after having finished secondary school. He was followed the next year by bassist Namsraijavyn Naranbaatar. With the arrival of singer Dambyn Tömörtsog in 1993, this second formation was complete and thus began the modern band.
Rhythm guitarist T.Naranbaatar joined Hurd at some point between 1993 and 1995.
Best Collection I, Best Collection II, Unplugged (1995–1999).
The first major concert by Hurd, called "Khar salkhi" (, "black wind"), was held at the State Circus in March 1995. For this reason, Hurd is considered to be officially founded in 1995, although they were active since 1987.
Hurd started to be famous among music listeners, especially with the song "Tsergiin bodol" (, "soldier's thoughts"), which quickly became a hit. From 1996 to 1997, Hurd made the "Kharankhui" (, "darkness") tour and released their first two albums - "The Best Collection I" and "The Best Collection II". These albums are out of print today and have become rarities. Also in 1997, the band made their first tour outside of Mongolia, traveling to China's Inner Mongolia region.
Prior to 1993, the drummer's duties were filled by Ganbayar, until D.Otgonbaatar has joined the band. From that point on, Ganbayar concentrated more on the band's management and playing secondary instruments.
In another never-been-done move, in May 1998, Hurd held a series of acoustic concerts, later released on CD as Unplugged. The best of Hurd's songs were re-arranged for this event and performed accompanied by a string ensemble, a saxophonist, a morin khuur player and a pianist.
Ödör Shönö, Myangan Jild Gants, Best Collection III (1999–2003).
From 1999 to 2007, the band was under the patronage of "Erel" (a Mongolian mining company) and its owner B.Erdenebat. The founder of the Motherland Party provided the band with new equipment and a rehearsal space, in exchange for their electoral support and participation in the party campaigns. For the release of their 1999 album "Ödör Shönö", the band used a new name - "Erel-Hurd" (), although it remains the sole occurrence other than a cassette tape compilation, "Shildeg duu", from that era.
In 2001, the band released a third studio album, The Best Collection III. It contained the hit single "Ekh oron", which was previously released in 1999, "Ekh oron"s B-sides and some more unreleased material from "The Best Collection I" and "II"'s sessions, plus a new track, "Shine jil", which was later put in their next album "Myangan Jild Gants", which included nu metal styled songs.
Mongold Törsön, Züirlekh Argagüi, Talarkhalyn Kontsert, Unplugged II (2003–2009).
In 2004, they released "Mongold Törsön", an album of patriotic songs, which was dedicated to the entire Mongol diaspora. The album is more hard rock and rock 'n roll based. In 2004, they experimented with industrial metal and recorded 16 songs with that theme, releasing them as "Züirlekh Argagüi" in 2005. On Naadam day, they played a concert in Sukhbaatar Square, releasing it as "Talarkhalyn Kontsert" in 2009.
In 2006, they recorded a second unplugged album, a DVD named "Unplugged II", releasing it in 2009 (a CD version of the show was released in 2006 in Inner Mongolia).
In July 2007, when the band returned from a 4-month stay in the United States, Erel's managers ordered the band to leave the rehearsal space and ceased any further cooperation.
The reasons that led the company management to proceed in that manner remain still unclear today.
Both sides came out of this 8-year partnership with their reputations damaged - the company for having exploited the band to achieve their political goals before rejecting them, and the band for having fraternized with politicians by interest.
Rhythm guitarist T.Naranbaatar has left Hurd at some point in late 2008 for undisclosed reasons.
Khairyn Salkhi, Black Box (2009–2014).
In 2010, they announced the release of their album "Khairyn Salkhi", which contains 12 songs revolving around the theme of love. The album did not get released properly - only a few promotional card-sleeve CD copies, homemade CDrs and cassette tapes and at least one semi-official pressing for the Inner Mongolian market were released.
In 2013, they released a box set called "Black Box - 20th anniversary limited edition" which contains all their studio albums, "Unplugged", a CD version of "Acoustic Unplugged-II kontsert" and two bonus CDs, thus putting their older albums back into print and giving "Khairyn Salkhi" its first official release.
Narlag Divaajin and 7,000,000,000 (2014–present).
A new album, Narlag Divaajin, was recorded in 2014 and was released in 2016.
2018 marked Hurd's official 25th anniversary and the 40th anniversary of the song "Tsergiin bodol", originally written in 1978.
Hurd's ninth studio album "7,000,000,000" (7 Billion) was released in July 2021.
In 2023, Hurd celebrated its 30th anniversary with an Asian tour, including their first shows in Australia (they performed in Sydney and Perth).
Style and lyrical themes.
Influenced by heavy metal and hard rock bands such as Metallica, Iron Maiden, WASP, Judas Priest or Guns N' Roses, Hurd's earlier material was classic heavy metal. As their career unfolded, they kept on exploring rock music genres. Nu metal material was written for Myangan Jild Gants, whereas in Mongold Törsön the band displayed more rock and roll and hard rock influences. Züirlekh Argagüi saw the band's return to their heavy metal roots with a shade of industrial metal.
Some songs are reminiscent of traditional Mongolian music, using pentatonic scales, traditional melody styles and instruments, most notably morin khuur. Also characteristic are ballads, which often revolve around the theme of love, respect for parents or national pride.
The band's roots in tradition and a focus on national pride make them especially popular in rural areas of Mongolia, as well as with Mongolian migrant workers abroad, such as in South Korea.
They are also popular in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and their sales figures for tapes and CDs are higher there than at home. When they first tried to enter into the Chinese market, they faced various problems: officials asked them to translate their lyrics from Mongolian into Chinese, and then banned some of them.
Hurd usually writes songs by composing music around proses and poems coming from either regular contributors or anonymous people.

Edward Blishen

Edward Blishen (29 April 1920 – 13 December 1996) was an English author and broadcaster. He may be known best for the first of two children's novels based on Greek mythology, written with Leon Garfield, illustrated by Charles Keeping, and published by Longman in 1970. For "The God Beneath the Sea" Blishen and Garfield won the 1970 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject.
There is also his series of autobiographical books, including "A Cack-Handed War" (1972), a story describing his experiences as a conscientious objector, set against the backdrop of the Second World War, and "Roaring Boys" (1955), an honest account of teaching in a London secondary modern school in the 1950s, a book still valuable to understand teaching in a "rough" part of a city. Its sequel, "This Right Soft Lot", was published in 1969. He finished the concluding volume of his autobiographical sequence, "Mind How You Go", in 1996, just before his death; it was published posthumously by Constable in 1997.
Biography.
Edward Blishen was born in Barnet, Hertfordshire, England. He attended Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Barnet, and after failing his exams at the age of 17 he left school to work on a local newspaper.
When the Second World War was declared, he became a conscientious objector.
Later, he taught for three years teaching in a Hampstead prep school, before going on to a secondary modern school in Holloway Road, north London, where he wrote his best-selling first book, "Roaring Boys", in 1955. Following its success, he gave up teaching in 1959 – although he did some part-time teaching at York University between 1963 and 1965 – in order to devote more time to writing and then to developing a career in broadcasting. Fans of "Roaring Boys" and its sequel, "This Right Soft Lot", ranged from the novelist Kingsley Amis to former Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.
For more than 33 years, from its inception in 1961 until, at least, 1994, Blishen was the editor of the "Junior Pears Encyclopaedia", published by Pelham Books.
Blishen had a regular column in "The Young Elizabethan".
As a broadcaster, Blishen did some notable work with the BBC's African Service and later was a presenter of the BBC Radio 4 programme "A Good Read" and regular contributor to "Stop the Week".
He also compiled a number of collections in the Kingfisher "Treasury of Stories" series and "Children’s Classics to Read Aloud".
In June 1995, Blishen was awarded an Honorary Degree from the Open University as Doctor of the University.
He died in Hadley Wood, Hertfordshire, in 1996, at the age of 76. He had two sons and was married to Nancy Smith.

Motomachi, Yokohama

 is a district in Naka Ward, Yokohama, Japan. It is situated immediately west of Yamate and east of Chinatown. The area features the Motomachi Shopping Street, which is a five-block-long stretch of boutiques and shops. It is known in Japan for its cosmopolitan atmosphere, distinctive fashion, and Western influences.
History.
Motomachi was originally a quiet farming and fishing village until 1859, when the Port of Yokohama was opened. Since then, the nearby Kannai district became the foreigners' business district, and the adjacent Yamate and Yamashitacho districts became the foreigners' residential districts. Situated in between Yamate to the east and Kannai and Yamashitacho to the west, Motomachi became frequented by many foreigners. Shops and businesses were opened, catering to the needs of foreigners.
In the early years of the Meiji era, there was a notable increase in the foreign population in Motomachi. This influx brought about a growing Western influence, leading to the establishment of various cafés, bakeries, and boutiques. These establishments were relatively uncommon in Japan at that time, and Motomachi played a role in introducing aspects of Western culture, contributing to the era known as "bunmei kaika," or cultural enlightenment. This marked the initial stages of what is now recognized as the Motomachi Shopping Street.
During the 1970s, the "Motomachi Shopping Street" became a catalyst for a unique fashion style known as "Hama tora" (short for "Yokohama traditional"). This style was popularized by renowned boutiques like Kitamura, Mihama, and Fukuzō, which were prominent in Motomachi's fashion scene at the time. 
Naming.
Upon the opening of the Port of Yokohama in 1859, this area was called . The name was changed to "Motomachi" in 1860.
Education.
Motomachi is zoned to Motomachi Elementary School (元街小学校), which caters to Minato Junior High School. ().

Columbia Queer Alliance

Columbia Queer Alliance (CQA) is the central Columbia University student organization that represents lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning LGBTQ students. It is the oldest such student organization in the world, originally called the Student Homophile League, established in 1966 and recognized by the university on April 19, 1967.
History.
During its first year, the Student Homophile League had about ten members who fought with university administrators until the group was officially recognized. Stephen Donaldson, a bisexual-identified LGBT rights activist, is commemorated by a plaque and a portrait in the queer student lounge that bears his name, in one of Columbia's residence halls, for spearheading the creation of the group. One of the key issues over which Donaldson clashed with the administration was the right to keep members' names confidential.
When the group's charter was finally granted in April 1967, Donaldson sent an announcement to every media outlet he knew, but the only response was a radio interview on WNEW, a New York station, and an article in the "Columbia Daily Spectator", which reported that some students believed the new group was an April Fools' Day joke. Two weeks later, on May 3, "The New York Times" reported the story on its front page. Donaldson later wrote: "The next couple days were frantic as media—which had ignored the press release—suddenly wanted the information I had already given them."
Student activists at Cornell University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Rutgers University, and Stanford University formed similar groups of their own within two years. More than 150 such student groups had been established by the end of four years.
Activities.
Among other activities, the Columbia Queer Alliance has hosted "First Friday Dances" for decades, which at their inception were one of the few places where college-age LGBT people could socialize with one another.
Many of the Columbia Queer Alliance's activities have been historically held in Earl Hall, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018 in recognition of its role in queer history.

Princess Margarita de Bourbon de Parme

Princess Margarita of Bourbon-Parma, Countess of Colorno (; born 13 October 1972), is the eldest daughter of Princess Irene of the Netherlands and Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma. She is a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma as well an extended member of the Dutch royal family. Per a 1996 royal decree issued by Queen Beatrix, she is entitled to the style and title "Her Royal Highness" Princess Margarita de Bourbon de Parme in The Netherlands as a member of the extended royal family.
Early life.
Born in Nijmegen, she is the twin sister of Prince Jaime. She also has an elder brother, Prince Carlos, and a younger sister, Princess Carolina. Her godparents are Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands (maternal aunt) and Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma (paternal uncle). She is the eldest granddaughter of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard.
In 1981, her parents divorced. Together with her mother and her siblings she moved from Spain to The Netherlands, to live with her grandparents, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld at Baarn. Later she moved to Wijk bij Duurstede. Margarita studied Cultural Anthropology at the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam and is an interior decorator. She studied interior architecture in The Hague.
First marriage and controversy.
On 19 June 2001, Princess Margarita married the entrepreneur Edwin Karel Willem de Roy van Zuydewijn, member of a Dutch patrician family. The civil marriage of the couple took place in Amsterdam, and the Roman Catholic marriage was held in Auch Cathedral (France), presided by Ronald Philippe Bär, the former Bishop of Rotterdam, on 22 September 2001. De Roy van Zuydewijn was, however, not trusted by the Dutch Royal Family, whose senior members therefore did not attend the marriage.
In 2003, a series of incidents became known as the "Margarita-affair". Margarita and her husband accused the Dutch Royal House and the Dutch secret service of obstructing the affairs of "Fincentives", the company of de Roy van Zuydewijn. They also said that their telephone conversations had been secretly tapped. Eventually it was revealed that the Queen's personal Cabinet had indeed ordered an investigation; the right to do so had been legally removed from the Queen.
The couple's home was the Bartas Castle in Saint-Georges, Gers, France, but by 2004 the princess was increasingly seen more often in Amsterdam than there. On 13 August 2004, it was revealed that she was filing for a divorce; the official divorce was signed on 8 November 2006. The marriage did not produce any children.
Because of the quarrels between the princess and the Dutch Royal family during the Margarita-affair, she was not welcome at the marriage of her cousin Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange to Máxima Zorreguieta, or at the funeral of her uncle, Prince Claus of the Netherlands. However, after her divorce from De Roy van Zuydewijn, her relationship with the royal family improved.
Second marriage and family.
On 3 May 2008, she married Tjalling Siebe ten Cate (born 23 December 1975, in Dordrecht), a lawyer at De Nederlandsche Bank (the Dutch National Bank), also a member of a Dutch patrician family. On 20 February 2023, Princess Margarita and Ten Cate announced their divorce. Together they have two daughters:
Margarita currently lives in Wassenaar.
Titles, styles and honours.
Already a ducal princess from birth, her father bestowed on 2 September 1996 the substantive title "Contessa di Colorno" (Countess of Colorno) upon her. The same year she was incorporated into the Dutch nobility by her aunt Queen Beatrix, with the highest noble title "Prinses de Bourbon de Parme" (Princess of Bourbon-Parma) and styled "Hare Koninklijke Hoogheid" ("Her Royal Highness"). She does not belong to the House of Orange-Nassau or the limited Dutch royal house, but as a granddaughter of Queen Juliana, she is officially a member of the more extended Dutch royal family.

<doc id="6926558" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6926558" title="Ivan Southall">
Ivan Southall

Ivan Francis Southall AM, DFC (8 June 192115 November 2008) was an Australian writer best known for young adult fiction. He wrote more than 30 children's books, six books for adults, and at least ten works of history, biography or other non-fiction.
Personal life.
Ivan Southall was born in Melbourne, Victoria. His father died when Ivan was 14, and he and his brother Gordon were raised by their mother. He went to Mont Albert Central School (where he wrote the first of his "Simon Black" stories) and later Box Hill Grammar, but was forced to leave school early, and became an apprentice process engraver. He joined the Royal Australian Air Force on 19 Jun 1942 serving with 461 Squadron RAAF (raised under an Article XV of the Empire Air Training Scheme) . He was decorated with the Distinguished Flying Cross for his role in sinking a German U-boat, U-385, in the Bay of Biscay on 11 August 1944 (in concert with the destroyer HMS Swift). He returned to Australia with his English bride, Joy Blackburn. Their youngest daughter was born with Down syndrome. His was discharged on 19 Nov 1946.
He tried his hand at farming at Monbulk, but the attempt foundered, so he became a full-time writer.
He met his first wife, Joy Blackburn, during the Second World War and they had four children, Andrew, Roberta, Elizabeth and Melissa. He remarried, to Susan Stanton, whom he met in 1974 on his United States visit to deliver the May Hill Arbuthnot Lecture at the University of Washington. Southall died of cancer on 15 November 2008 aged 87.
His daughter Elizabeth had three daughters, the eldest of whom was murdered in 1999. Elizabeth wrote a book about the case in 2002 titled "Perfect Victim". The story was made into a film called "In Her Skin" in 2009.
Writer.
Ivan Southall began his career as a writer primarily writing historical accounts for adults. Notably, he wrote the biography of Keith Truscott, an Australian fighter ace who served in England in the last stages of the Battle of Britain and the aftermath, and later in Darwin and at Milne Bay.
Southall also wrote the official history of his Royal Australian Air Force squadron, 461 Squadron, based at Pembroke Dock, a town in South West Wales, when he was pilot of Short Sunderland flying boats. Later he published a version of this history as "They Shall Not Pass Unseen" and much later returned to his experiences of combat in Sunderlands in books for younger readers.
Southall also wrote "Softly Tread the Brave", describing the courage of Royal Australian Volunteer Naval Reserve bomb disposal officers, Hugh Syme (GC, GM and Bar) and John Mould (GC, GM), who served in England disarming parachute mines. Southall later published a version of this story for younger readers under the title "Seventeen Seconds" — the time available to run in case the fuse of the mine was accidentally triggered while trying to disarm it.
From 1950 to 1962, Southall also wrote, for younger readers, adventure stories about a fictional brave pilot, 'Simon Black' — an Australian counterpart to W.E. Johns' hero 'Biggles'. Several of these ventured into science-fiction, with space flight, aliens and lost humanoid races.
After 1960, Southall's career pivoted into the everyday world of children and teenage characters. Southall dealt in his books both with survival in the face of dramatic events such as fire and flood and with personal and psychological challenges. He was one of the first to write specifically for young adults.
Southall's best known children's novels include "Hills End", "Ash Road", "Let the Balloon Go" and "Josh" (1962 to 1971). The non-fiction "Fly West" recounts his experiences in Short Sunderland flying boats during the Second World War. He is the only Australian winner of the annual Carnegie Medal for British children's books, the 1971 award to "Josh".
A retrospective exhibition "Southall A–Z: Ash Road to Ziggurat" was held in the State Library of Victoria in 1998 and is available online. It includes an interview conducted in 1997, a biography, bibliography and exhibition of book cover designs with information about the books.
Honours.
Ivan Southall won the 1971 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising "Josh" as the year's best children's book by a British subject. He was the first Medalist from outside the United Kingdom and remains the only one from Australia.
"Ash Road", "To the Wild Sky", "Bread and Honey" and the nonfiction "Fly West" were all named CBCA Australian Children's Book of the Year (1966 to 1976).
Southall was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1981.
In 2003 he was awarded the Dromkeen Medal by the Oldmeadow Foundation for his lifetime contribution to children's literature in Australia.
Earlier that year, the Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association had recognised "The Long Night Watch" (Methuen Children's Books, 1983) as the best English-language children's book that did not get a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. It is named for the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book's rise from obscurity.
"The Sly Old Wardrobe", written by Southall and illustrated by Ted Greenwood, was named Children's Picture Book of the Year in 1969.
Works.
Fiction.
After "Simon Black", Southall changed emphasis "from the actual adventure ... to the depiction of the way children respond, interact and grow".

On March 18, 2025, he returned to Earth on the SpaceX Dragon capsule with the other crew members of Crew-9. The crew that replaced the Boeing Crew Flight Test astronauts aboard the ISS arrived on March 16.
Prior to being selected as a NASA astronaut in July 2000, Wilmore was an experienced Navy test pilot. He also participated in the development of the T-45 Goshawk jet trainer.

Wilmore self-identifies as a Christian. During a press conference on March 31, 2025, he said that it was vital for him to continuously connect with his faith and church family, and this is why, while in orbit, he continued to regularly attend remote Sunday services streamed from Providence Baptist Church in Pasadena, Texas and Grace Baptist Church in Mount Juliet. He serves as an elder at Providence Baptist.
Background education.
Wilmore graduated from Mount Juliet High School in Mount Juliet, Tennessee.

His test tour also included a stint at USNTPS as a systems and fixed wing "Flight Test" instructor. Prior to his selection to NASA, Wilmore was on exchange to the Air Force as a "Flight Test" instructor at the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California.
NASA experience.
Wilmore was selected as a pilot by NASA in July 2000 and reported for training that August 2000. Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation, Wilmore was assigned technical duties representing the Astronaut Office on all propulsion systems issues including the Space Shuttle Main Engines, solid rocket motor, external tank, and also served on the astronaut support team that traveled to the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, in support of launch and landing operations.
STS-129.
In 2009, Wilmore piloted the for the STS-129 mission to the International Space Station.
Expedition 41/42.
Wilmore returned to space in September 2014 as a member of the Soyuz TMA-14M long duration International Space Station crew. During this mission, humans manufactured off world for the first time. The International Space Station's 3-D printer, designed and built by Made In Space, Inc., was used to print a tool with a design file transmitted from the ground to the printer. The tool was a ratchet wrench needed by Wilmore, who would have had to wait for the tool to be delivered on the next supply mission from Earth. The wrench was later returned to the ground for analysis and testing, along with the other parts printed in space.
Boeing Crew Flight Test.
On October 7, 2020, NASA and Boeing announced Wilmore would join astronauts Michael Fincke and Nicole Mann for NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test (CFT), the inaugural crewed flight of the CST-100 Starliner launching to the International Space Station in 2021. On April 18, 2022, NASA said that it has not finalized which of the cadre of Starliner astronauts, including Wilmore, Fincke, and Sunita Williams, would fly on the Crewed Flight Test mission or the first operational Starliner mission. On June 16, 2022, NASA confirmed that CFT will be a two-person flight test, consisting of Wilmore and Williams. On June 5, 2024, Starliner was launched successfully to orbit with Williams as the spacecraft's pilot. On June 6, Starliner docked to the ISS after over a day in space.
The mission was meant to last eight days, ending with a landing in the southwestern United States on June 14. However, the capsule's thrusters malfunctioned as Starliner docked with the ISS. Despite months of testing, NASA felt it was not able to understand why the thrusters malfunctioned and decided that it was too risky to return Wilmore and Williams to Earth aboard Starliner. The Boeing Starliner spacecraft returned uncrewed on September 6, 2024, and landed intact at White Sands Space Harbor, New Mexico at 12:01 a.m., September 7, after three months in space docked to the ISS. In December 2024, it was announced that Wilmore and Williams would return to Earth no earlier than late March 2025 on a SpaceX Dragon capsule.
On January 30, 2025, Williams and Wilmore were scheduled to begin the station's 274th spacewalk, retrieving hardware from the exterior of the International Space Station.
On March 18, 2025, Williams and Wilmore finally returned to Earth on the SpaceX Dragon capsule with the other crew members of Crew-9.
On August 6, 2025, NASA announced Wilmore's retirement from the agency.

Swedish Dancesport Federation

Swedish Dancesport Federation (DSF) administers all dancesport in Sweden. The association was formed on February 25, 1968, and is one of 68 different sports federations in Sweden. DSF became a member of the Swedish Sports Confederation (RF) in 1977, which administers all sports in Sweden. Apart from this membership Swedish Dancesport Federation also is a member of the International Dancesport Federation (IDSF) from June 19, 2011, known as the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF) and the World Rock'n'Roll Confederation (WRRC). The office lies in Farsta, Stockholm.
Overview.
Swedish Dancesport Federation covers approximately 38,500 members in 156 associated danceclubs (2008), from Kiruna in the very north of Sweden to Malmö in the south.
Swedish Dancesport Federation is divided into 9 regions. These regional dancesport federations are more often called districts.
The presidium is selected from the annual general meeting. The presidium comprises the federation's chairman and six general members, and three deputies selected from the annual meeting. In order to support the activities, the organisation is divided in different committees, whose members are elected by the presidium.
These committees are; Dance BRR (Bugg and Rock'n'Roll dances), Dance Tendance, Information-PR, Youth, Jurisprudence, District-Central Projects and Line Dance.
Dancesport within the association is divided in three dance categories. Namely Ballroom dancing (Tendance), Swing dances or as called in Sweden Bugg and Rock'n' Roll dances (in short terms just BRR dances) besides Line dance. Ballroom covers five Latin dances (Cha-Cha-Cha, Samba, Rumba, Paso Doble and Jive), and five Standard dances (Slow Waltz, Tango, Slow Foxtrot, Viennese Waltz and Quickstep). BRR dances covers Bugg, Double bugg, Lindy Hop (Jitterbug), Boogie Woogie and Rock'n'Roll dance.
The danceclubs, associated to Swedish Dancesport Federation, arranges each year approximately 75-100 dance competitions around Sweden.

On dance competitions in Sweden all ages and a majority of the classes often occur. Common is however, that dance competitions are separate for Line dance, Ballroom dances and BRR-dances. District championships and Swedish championships are arranged annually in all dances, as well as Swedish Championships for danceclubs (teams).

Boriçi was pursuing secondary studies in the Xaverian College of his city, and was only 15 when he played as part of the first team of Vllaznia Shkodër in an August 1937 friendly against Dragoi Pogradec. He went to Italy, and registered at La Sapienza University, Rome, to pursue Jurisprudence studies, and in 1941, became part of the SS Lazio team, where he played in the first year with the reserves, and in the second year he was part of the first team, with which he scored 6 goals in 19 matches. Upon his return to Albania he captained Vllaznia Shkodër to two titles, the 1945, and the 1946 ones, after which, in 1949, at the age of 27, he joined Partizani Tirana. With Partizani Boriçi won the 1949 and 1954 titles. He closed his career at Spartak Tirana, but it is believed that he may have played some games also with Flamurtari Vlorë.
International career.
Boriçi made his debut for the Albania national team in an August 1946 friendly match against Montenegro and earned a total of 24 caps, scoring 6 goals. His final international was a September 1957 friendly match against China. Boriçi captained Albania in winning the Balkan Cup in 1946.
Managerial career.
Boriçi became then manager at KF Partizani, a team which he led to winning the 1962–63, the 1963–64, and the 1970–71 titles, in addition he led also the 1963–64, the 1965–66, the 1967–68, and the 1969–70 Albanian Cups.
Aside Partizani, he managed the Albania national team in five separate stints.
Personal life.
Boriçi never married, but it was believed that he had fathered a son with a married woman. KF Tirana fans during the derbies against FK Partizani Tirana, would usually sing the name of his natural son, in order to make him angry, which usually succeeded.

Boris Pandža

Boris Pandža (born 15 December 1986) is a Bosnian football manager and former player who is currently working as an assistant manager at Bosnian Premier League club Široki Brijeg.
Club career.
Early career.
Pandža, who played solely in defense, started his youth career at hometown club Zrinjski Mostar before moving to Široki Brijeg, where he started his professional career.
Hajduk Split.
After two-years at Široki Brijeg, Pandža joined Croatian First League club Hajduk Split in January 2006, but the move was completed in late-2006 and the fee was worth about €200,000 on a four-and-a-half-year contract. After spending two season limited in the first team, he started to be used more regularly under the management of Ante Miše.
On 17 May 2009, Pandža scored his first goal for the club, in a 2–0 victory against Šibenik. After an impressive display at the club, he attracted interests from Premier League side Stoke City. Upon his departure from Hajduk, Pandža said he wasn't sorry for leaving the club.
Mechelen.
In July 2010, Pandža joined Belgian side Mechelen as a replacement for Jonas Ivens on a three-year contract, with a €350,000 transfer fee. He made his debut for the opening game of the season, in a 2–0 win over Lokeren on 31 July 2010 and then scored his first goal for the club, in a 2–1 win over Zulte Waregem one week after his debut. He then scored his second goal, in a 1–0 win over Standard Liège on 17 September 2010 and a third goal came on 1 October 2010, in a 2–2 draw against Genk. In his first full season at the club, Pandža scored four goals in thirty-seven appearances in all competitions. His second season was more enjoyable, scoring the club's first goal of the season, as they beat Sint-Truidense 2–1 on 30 July 2011. He then scored another on 25 January 2012, in a 3–2 win over Genk.
In his second season at the club, Pandža scored two goals in thirty-one appearances in all competitions. His last season with the club saw him stay at the club after his scheduled move to Arsenal Kyiv collapsed following a failure to meet Pandža's requirements. However, it went appalling for Pandža when he sustained a knee injury, in a 2–0 loss against Beerschot on 1 September 2012 and was out for four weeks. However, it was announced furthermore that he was to be out for 6 months with an injury that could miss the rest of the season. His knee surgery was a success. After three years at the club, Pandža left the club upon after his contract expired. Upon leaving Mechelen, he expressed "disappointment" for leaving the club.
In July 2013, Pandža was linked with a move to Scottish League One side Rangers. He then began talks with the club over possibly joining Rangers. He himself pleaded to Rangers, quoting: "come and get him" and even willing to risk his wages. Despite the expected agreement which lasted for two months, the move appeared to be stalled. The move was stalled, which was believed to put on hold by the club's chief executive Craig Mather and Pandža would later accuse the club of lacking professionalism for shattering his move to Rangers.
Górnik Zabrze.
Despite a shattered move to Rangers, Pandža joined Polish side Górnik Zabrze on a one-year contract with an option to extend it. However, after making only thirteen appearances in all competitions, he was released by the club after one season.
Later stage of career.
Pandža then returned to Široki Brijeg for the 2014–15 season, making 17 appearances as the club finished in 4th place. The following season, he managed just 9 league appearances. After Široki Brijeg, he also played at Čelik Zenica and Croatian club Šibenik. He finished his career at the end of the 2020–21 season at Šibenik.
International career.
Pandža was part of the Bosnia and Herzegovina U21 national team together with players like Edin Džeko, Vedad Ibišević and Sejad Salihović. He captained the team on a few occasions. He received his first senior call up for a game against Norway on 18 March 2007. He made his international debut on 2 June 2007 against Turkey in a 3–2 win. He then became a regular member of the squad.
In May 2014, Pandža was left out of the final squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. On 5 September 2014, he announced his retirement from the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team.
Managerial career.
On 12 May 2024, Pandža was appointed as Široki Brijeg's caretaker manager for the remainder of the 2023–24 Bosnian Premier League season.

Michael Barratt (astronaut)

Michael Reed Barratt (born April 16, 1959) is an American physician and a NASA astronaut. Board certified in internal and aerospace medicine, he served as a flight surgeon for NASA before his selection as an astronaut and has played a role in developing NASA's space medicine programs for both the Shuttle–Mir program and International Space Station. His first spaceflight was a long-duration mission to the International Space Station as a flight engineer on the Expedition 19 and 20 crew. In March 2011, Barratt completed his second spaceflight as a crew member of STS-133. Barratt made a second long-duration mission to the International Space Station as a flight engineer on the Expedition 70, 71, and 72 crew and also served as the pilot on the SpaceX Crew-8 mission.
Education.
Barratt graduated from Camas High School in 1977. He graduated from the University of Washington in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology, going on to earn an M.D. from Northwestern University in 1985. He completed a three-year residency in internal medicine at Northwestern University in 1988; his Chief Residency year was at Veterans Administration Lakeside Hospital in Chicago in 1989. In 1991, Barratt completed both a residency and a Master of Science in aerospace medicine jointly run by Wright State University, NASA, and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. He is board certified in Internal and Aerospace Medicine.
Barratt holds a private pilot's license and has been qualified on NASA's T-38 Talons.
NASA career.
Barratt first came to NASA's Johnson Space Center in May 1991 as a project physician working for KRUG Life Sciences, serving on the Health Maintenance Facility Project as manager of the Hyperbaric and Respiratory Subsystems for the Space Station Freedom project. In July 1992, he was hired by NASA as an aviation medical examiner working in Space Shuttle Medical Operations.
In July 1993, Barratt was one of a team of the first three Americans invited to witness the recovery of a Soyuz spacecraft. Asked to help evaluate the potential of the Soyuz as a Crew Return Vehicle for a NASA space station, he flew with the recovery team that picked up the crew of Soyuz TM-16 after they landed in Kazakhstan. (The Soyuz was ultimately chosen as the return vehicle for the International Space Station).
In January 1994, he was assigned to the Shuttle-Mir Program. He spent over 12 months working and training in the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia as one of two flight surgeons supporting Norman Thagard and his backup Bonnie Dunbar, a role that often included negotiations to resolve different approaches to medicine by NASA and Russian doctors. Barratt and fellow flight surgeon David Ward developed a Mir Supplemental Medical Kit to augment Russian equipment on Mir and developed a program of training for its use, taught to both NASA astronauts and Russian cosmonauts.
Thagard launched to Mir aboard Soyuz TM-21 and returned to earth on STS-71; during the 115-day flight, Barratt and Ward effectively served as CAPCOMs for the NASA Shuttle-Mir team in addition to their duties as flight surgeons.
From July 1995 through July 1998, Barratt served as Medical Operations Lead for the International Space Station (ISS). A frequent traveler to Russia, he worked with counterparts at Star City and the Institute of Biomedical Problems and other ISS partner centers, developing medical procedures, training, and equipment for ISS. Barratt served as lead crew surgeon for ISS Expedition 1 from July 1998 until selected as an astronaut candidate. He serves as Associate Editor for Space Medicine for the journal Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine and is senior editor of the textbook "Principles of Clinical Medicine for Space Flight".
Barratt was selected by NASA to join Astronaut Group 18 as a mission specialist in July 2000. Barratt reported for training in August 2000. Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation, he was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Station Operations Branch.
NEEMO 7.
In October 2004, Barratt served as an aquanaut during the mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for eleven days. During NEEMO 7 the crew tested technologies and procedures for remote surgery, as well as using virtual reality for telemedicine.
Expedition 19/20.
Barratt was assigned to the Expedition 19 crew in February 2008 and launched to the International Space Station in March 2009 aboard Soyuz TMA-14. His stay aboard the ISS continued until the end of Expedition 20 in October 2009.
During Expedition 20, Barratt performed both an EVA and IVA together with Gennady Padalka. The first EVA, on June 5, 2009, lasted for 4 hours and 54 minutes and prepared the "Zvezda" service module transfer compartment for the arrival of the "Poisk" module, installed docking antenna for the module, photographed an antenna for evaluation on the ground, and photographed the Strela-2 crane.
The second was an internal spacewalk (IVA) in the depressurized "Zvezda" transfer compartment to replace one of the "Zvezda" hatches with a docking cone in preparation for the docking of the "Poisk" module later in 2009. This IVA lasted 12 minutes.
Barratt returned to Earth on October 11, 2009 after spending 198 days, 16 hours, and 42 minutes in space on Soyuz TMA-14 along with Padalka and space tourist Guy Laliberté.
STS-133.
Barratt next flew to space as a mission specialist on STS-133, the final flight of Space Shuttle "Discovery". The mission launched on February 24, 2011, and landed on March 9, 2011. The mission transported several items to the space station, including the Permanent Multipurpose Module "Leonardo", which was left permanently docked at one of the station's ports. The shuttle also carried the third of four ExPRESS Logistics Carriers to the ISS, as well as a humanoid robot called Robonaut. During the mission Barratt was in charge of robotics activities. The total duration of STS-133 was 12 days, 19 hours, and 4 minutes.
Post-Shuttle era.
From January 2012 through April 2013, Barratt was manager of the Human Research Program at NASA Johnson Space Center, researching the health and performance risks associated with long-duration human spaceflight and mitigating them.
In 2013, Barratt served as cavenaut during the ESA CAVES training in Sardinia, alongside fellow NASA astronaut Jack Fisher, CSA astronaut Jeremy Hansen, JAXA astronaut Satoshi Furukawa, ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin.
Expedition 70/71/72.
Barratt made a second long-duration mission to the International Space Station as a flight engineer on the Expedition 70, 71, and 72 crew and also served as the pilot on the SpaceX Crew-8 mission, which launched on March 4, 2024. The mission successfully splashed down on October 25, 2024, concluding a nearly eight-month science mission.
Personal life.
Born in Vancouver, Washington, Barratt considers Camas, Washington to be his hometown. He is married to Dr. Michelle Lynne Barratt (née Sasynuik); they reside in League City, Texas, and have five children. His father and mother, Joseph and Donna Barratt, reside in Camas.

Batch distillation

Batch distillation refers to the use of distillation in batches, meaning that a mixture is distilled to separate it into its component fractions before the distillation still is again charged with more mixture and the process is repeated. This is in contrast with continuous distillation where the feedstock is added and the distillate drawn off without interruption.
Batch distillation has always been an important part of the production of seasonal, or low capacity and high-purity chemicals. It is a very frequent separation process in the pharmaceutical industry.
Batch rectifier.
The simplest and most frequently used batch distillation configuration is the batch rectifier, including the alembic and pot still.
The batch rectifier consists of a pot (or reboiler), rectifying column, a condenser, some means of splitting off a portion of the condensed vapour (distillate) as reflux, and one or more receivers.
The pot is filled with liquid mixture and heated. Vapour flows upwards in the rectifying column and condenses at the top. Usually, the entire condensate is initially returned to the column as reflux. This contacting of vapour and liquid considerably improves the separation. Generally, this step is named start-up. The first condensate is the "head", and it contains undesirable components. The last condensate is the "feints" and it is also undesirable, although it adds flavor. In between is the "heart" and this forms the desired product.
The head and feints may be thrown out, refluxed, or added to the next batch of mash/juice, according to the practice of the distiller. After some time, a part of the overhead condensate is withdrawn continuously as distillate and it is accumulated in the receivers, and the other part is recycled into the column as reflux.
Owing to the differing vapour pressures of the distillate, there will be a change in the overhead distillation with time, as early on in the batch distillation, the distillate will contain a high concentration of the component with the higher relative volatility. As the supply of the material is limited and lighter components are removed, the relative fraction of heavier components will increase as the distillation progresses.
Batch stripper.
The other simple batch distillation configuration is the batch stripper. The batch stripper consists of the same parts as the batch rectifier. However, in this case, the charge pot is located above the stripping column.
During operation (after charging the pot and starting up the system) the high boiling constituents are primarily separated from the charge mixture. The liquid in the pot is depleted in the high boiling constituents, and enriched in low boiling ones. The high boiling product is routed into the bottom product receivers. The residual low boiling product is withdrawn from the charge pot. This mode of batch distillation is very seldom applied in industrial processes.
Middle vessel column.
A third feasible batch column configuration is the middle vessel column. The middle vessel column consists of both a rectifying and a stripping section and the charge pot is located at the middle of the column.
Feasibility studies.
Generally, the feasibility studies of batch distillation are based on analyses of the following maps:
During the feasibility studies, the following basic simplifying assumptions are made:
Bernot "et al." used the batch distillation regions to determine the sequence of the fractions. According to Ewell and Welch, a batch distillation region gives the same fractions upon rectification of any mixture lying within it. Bernot "et al." examined the still and distillate paths for the determination of the region boundaries under high number of stages and high reflux ratio, named maximal separation. Pham and Doherty in pioneering work described the structure and properties of residue curve maps for ternary heterogeneous azeotropic mixtures. In their model, the possibility of the phase separation of the vapour condensed is not taken into consideration yet. The singular points of the residue curve maps determined by this method were used to assign batch distillation regions by Rodriguez-Donis "et al." and Skouras "et al." Modla "et al." pointed out that this method may give misleading results for the minimal amount of entrainer. Lang and Modla extended the method of Pham and Doherty and suggested a new, general method for the calculation of residue curves and for the determination of batch distillation regions of heteroazeotropic distillation.
Lelkes "et al." published a feasibility method for the separation of minimum boiling point azeotropes by continuously entrainer feeding batch distillation. This method has been applied for the use of a light entrainer in the batch rectifier and stripper by Lang "et al." (1999) and it applied for maximum azeotropes by Lang "et al." Modla "et al." extended this method for batch heteroazeotropic distillation under continuous entrainer feeding.

WFXQ-CD

WFXQ-CD (channel 28) is a low-power, Class A television station in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States. It is a translator of dual NBC/CW+ affiliate WWLP (channel 22), owned by Nexstar Media Group. WFXQ-CD's transmitter is located at the old Mount Tom Ski Area summit in Holyoke. Its parent station maintains studios at Broadcast Center in the Sandy Hill section of Chicopee at the northwest corner of the I-391/MA 116/Chicopee Street interchange.
History.
The station first went on-the-air May 6, 1987, on VHF channel 11. Using the calls W11BJ, it originally aired a low-powered analog signal from the Rattlesnake Mountain transmitter site of Connecticut's Fox affiliate WTIC-TV (channel 61). The station was an independent that aired local shows to a senior retirement community in Farmington, Connecticut. It used a live skycam weather forecast which consisted of a character generator and a home video camera with shots of the window from the transmitter building. The owner of the station was the Chase family (who also owned WTIC-TV).
When LIN TV bought W11BJ in 2004, there was a construction permit approved to broadcast this station on UHF channel 28 from a new transmitter on Mount Tom in Holyoke. During the building of this transmitter, WWLP temporarily put on a simulcast of Connecticut's UPN affiliate WCTX (a sister station) through an off-air pickup. In early 2006, W28CT signed-on from the top of Mount Tom and the W11BJ transmitter on Rattlesnake Mountain was shut down. Right from the start, the station began to simulcast WWLP in a full-time manner. LIN TV had initially changed the call sign to WXCW-CA in reference to The CW in anticipation of it becoming an affiliate of that network. This affiliation eventually went to cable-only WB affiliate "WBQT".
As a result, the channel's call sign was changed again to WFXQ-CA referring to a possible Fox affiliation. This caused rumors on several television industry message boards that it would become an affiliate of that network. Speculation also existed that WFXQ might affiliate with Fox's new sister network, MyNetworkTV. At the time, cable television viewers in the Springfield–Holyoke market received Fox from WTIC-TV and the network's owned-and-operated station in Boston, WFXT, with MyNetworkTV coming from WCTX.
On November 16, 2007, the "Springfield Republican" reported that ABC affiliate WGGB-TV would be launching a Fox affiliate on a new second subchannel which was expected to launch at the end of that year. This was ultimately delayed until the end of March 2008 when the new service took on a primary Fox and secondary MyNetworkTV affiliation. Up to that time, Springfield held the distinction of being the largest television market without a Fox affiliate of its own.
Until December 9, 2008, WFXQ's analog signal transmitted on the same frequency as CW affiliate WLWC in Providence, Rhode Island. After the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved a construction permit, the station "flash-cut" to digital sometime after June 12, 2009, although, at the time, the station was still assigned a "-CA" suffix. Eventually, the FCC updated its listing and this channel began using the WFXQ-CD calls. Since that point it has mainly served as a local UHF translator of WWLP for the central part of the Springfield market, including Northampton, Easthampton, and Holyoke, and most of Springfield.
On March 21, 2014, Media General announced that it would purchase LIN Media and its stations, including WWLP and WFXQ-CD, in a $1.6 billion merger. The merger was completed on December 19.
On January 1, 2015, WWLP began to carry what had been the cable-exclusive CW affiliate WBQT as their second digital subchannel, which also applied to WFXQ-CD's second subchannel, finally fulfilling the original purpose of LIN's purchase of the station.
On September 8, 2015, Media General announced that it would acquire the Meredith Corporation for $2.4 billion, with the combined group to be renamed Meredith Media General once the sale is finalized. Because Meredith already owns WGGB-TV, and the Springfield-Holyoke market does not have enough full-power television stations to legally allow a duopoly in any event (WGGB and WWLP are the only full-power licenses assigned to the market), the companies would have been required to sell either WGGB or WWLP to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as recent changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations that restrict sharing agreements. Meredith-owned CBS affiliate WSHM-LD (channel 3) is the only one of the three stations affected by the merger that could legally be acquired by Meredith Media General, as FCC rules permit common ownership of full-power and low-power stations regardless of the number of stations within a single market. On January 27, 2016, however, Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Media General, who subsequently abandoned its plans to purchase Meredith.
Subchannels.

Following retirement of the Space Shuttle, Behnken was Chief of the Astronaut Office from 2012 to 2015. Assigned to the SpaceX Dragon 2 in 2018 as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, Behnken launched aboard the spacecraft's first crewed mission with fellow astronaut Doug Hurley on May 30, 2020, and became one of the first two astronauts launching aboard a commercial orbital spacecraft in spaceflight history. The mission, Crew Dragon Demo-2, took Behnken and Hurley to the International Space Station (ISS), where they docked and stayed aboard for 62 days. Behnken completed four spacewalks with NASA astronaut Christopher Cassidy.
Education.
Behnken attended Pattonville High School in Maryland Heights, Missouri (in St. Louis County), and went on to earn Bachelor of Science degrees in mechanical engineering and physics from Washington University in St. Louis in 1992. He then attended the California Institute of Technology, where he earned an MS degree in 1993 and a PhD in 1997, both in mechanical engineering. While at Caltech he shared a doctoral advisor, Christopher E. Brennen, with another future NASA astronaut, Garrett Reisman.
Behnken's graduate thesis research was in the area of nonlinear control applied to stabilizing rotating stall and surge in axial-flow compressors. The research included nonlinear analysis, real-time software implementation development, and extensive hardware construction. During his first two years of graduate study, Behnken developed and implemented real-time control algorithms and hardware for flexible robotic manipulators.
Air Force career.
Before entering graduate school, Behnken was an Air Force ROTC student at Washington University in St. Louis, and after graduate school was assigned to enter Air Force active duty at Eglin AFB, Florida. While at Eglin, he worked as a technical manager and developmental engineer for new munitions systems. Behnken was next assigned to attend the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School Flight Test Engineer's course at Edwards AFB, California. After graduating, he was assigned to the F-22 Combined Test Force (CTF) and remained at Edwards. While assigned to the F-22 program, Behnken was the lead flight test engineer for Raptor 4004 and a special projects test director. These responsibilities included flight test sortie planning, control room configuration development, and test conduct. Behnken also flew in both the F-15 and F-16 aircraft in support of the F-22 flight test program.
NASA career.
Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in July 2000, Behnken reported for training in August 2000. Following the completion of 18 months of training and evaluation, he was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Shuttle Operations Branch supporting launch and landing operations at Kennedy Space Center, Florida.
In September 2006, Behnken served as an aquanaut during the mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for seven days.
STS-123.
Behnken was a crew member of the STS-123 mission that delivered the Japanese Experiment Module and the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator to the International Space Station in March 2008. Behnken took part in three spacewalks during the mission.
STS-130.
Behnken flew to space for the second time as a mission specialist on STS-130, which launched at 04:14 EST (09:14 UTC) February 8, 2010. This mission delivered the "Tranquility" module and Cupola to the International Space Station. Behnken again took part in three spacewalks during this mission.
Chief of the Astronaut Office.
In July 2012, Behnken was named Chief of the Astronaut Office, succeeding Peggy Whitson. He held the job until July 2015, when he was succeeded by Chris Cassidy, after being selected as one of four astronauts training to fly spacecraft contracted under NASA's Commercial Crew Program.
SpX-DM2.
In August 2018, Behnken was assigned to the first test flight SpX-DM2 of the SpaceX Crew Dragon. Behnken and fellow crewmember Douglas Hurley were humorously compared in news and social media to the fictional brothers Bob and Doug McKenzie because of their friendship when they participated in the first commercial astronaut launch on SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2.
It successfully launched on May 30, 2020. The spacecraft successfully docked with the International Space Station on May 31, 2020. Behnken and Doug Hurley joined the ISS Expedition 63 crew, which also consisted of NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Ivan Vagner and Anatoli Ivanishin. They returned to Earth in the same capsule on August 2, 2020. His seat of the SpaceX "Endeavour" was later used by his wife, K. Megan McArthur in SpaceX Crew-2 mission, which was the second flight of "Endeavour".
Behnken retired from NASA on November 11, 2022.
Personal life.
Behnken is married to fellow astronaut Megan McArthur and they have one son. Behnken holds an amateur radio license with the call sign KE5GGX. His wife flew on the Crew-2 mission, using the same Dragon capsule and the same seat that he used during the Demo-2 mission. She returned from the International Space Station on November 8, 2021.

Gabe Jones

Gabriel "Gabe" Jones is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist and co-plotter Jack Kirby, he made his first appearance in World War II war comics series "Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos" #1 (May 1963).
Derek Luke portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film "". Additionally, B. J. Britt portrayed Jones' grandson, Antoine "Trip" Triplett in the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."
Publication history.
Gabe Jones appeared as a regular cast-member in virtually every issue and annual of "Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos." In present-day stories, initially in the feature "Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D." in "Strange Tales", he appears as an agent of that fictional espionage organization — inexplicably aged very little, like fellow World War II vet and agent Dum Dum Dugan, despite a retcon explanation for agency head Nick Fury's youthfulness. As a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Jones has appeared in issues of "The Avengers", "Iron Man", "Captain America", "The Incredible Hulk", "Godzilla", the first two volumes of "Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.", and the 1988 miniseries "Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D."
Although colorist Stan Goldberg knew that Jones was African American, the company that made the engraving plates for "Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos" #1 thought a mistake had been made and colored him the same color as the rest of the Howling Commandos.
Fictional character biography.
Gabe Jones was born in New York City. He is an original member of the Howling Commandos combat squad of World War II. The squad's senior officer Samuel "Happy Sam" Sawyer was given virtual carte blanche in choosing its members, including the African-American Jones, despite the fact that (at the time) integrated units were unheard of; The U.S. Armed Forces in real life were not integrated until 1948 by executive order of President Harry S. Truman. He is one of Nick Fury's close confidantes, serving under his sergeant during the Korean War and the Vietnam War in reunion missions and also joined the international espionage organization S.H.I.E.L.D. at some unspecified point after the World War II.
During the war, the Howling Commandos travel to Wakanda to combat a Nazi invasion of that land. Jones helps out the ruling family by killing a Nazi agent who had taken an infant hostage.
In 1959, he is shown working with Dum Dum Dugan and Fury, hunting down and executing Nazis. Later in the same year, Gabe assisted Fury and Dugan in creating the first team of Avengers. They successfully stopped a Nazi splinter group from gaining a version of the Super-Soldier formula.
Jones retired from S.H.I.E.L.D. sometime after, but returned to help train a new corps of recruits. This new class is slain by the terrorist organization HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s primary nemesis.
Gabe spends time trying to bring down the evil Secret Empire from within. Following the events of Secret Invasion both he and Dugan quit S.H.I.E.L.D. and recreate the Howling Commandos with ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
Jones is seen commanding the murder scene investigation of his old friend Clay Quartermain.
Jones and fellow Commando Eric Koenig are later killed by the Gorgon during a battle with HYDRA, while both were fighting a holding action against enemy forces to give time for allies to retreat.

Mathieu d'Escouchy

Mathieu d'Escouchy (Le Quesnoy, Nord, 1420 – 1482) was a Picard chronicler during the last stages of the Hundred Years War.
His "Chronique" was a continuation of the chronicle of Enguerrand de Monstrelet, with manuscripts of which it occurs as a third volume; it was edited by G. du Fresne de Beaucourt, (3 vols., Paris, Societé de l'Histoire de France, 1863–64). Matthieu covers the years 1444-61, from a point of view favourable to Burgundy, but with an attempt at impartiality, though he was in the service of Louis XI, with whom he fought at the Battle of Montlhéry (16 July 1465), after which he was ennobled. Like most literate men of his time, he was fascinated by feats of arms, brave tourneys and the social stature of the men (and a few women) who figure in his chronicle. His account of the Banquet du Voeu du Faisan, describes the ceremonious feast held at Lille in 1454 by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, whose court set the standards for elegant extravagance in the fifteenth century.
He was appointed Echevin and Prévôt of Péronne. He fell afoul of justice, was even arrested and tortured but set free at last.
In "Escouchy" some editors read a variant of the familiar seigneurial name "Coucy".
He described the arrival of Mary of Guelders bride of James II in Scotland on 18 June 1449. She sailed from Sluis and landed first on the Isle of May in the Forth, making a pilgrimage to the Chapel of St Adrian on 18 June 1449.

Stephen Bowen (astronaut)

Stephen Gerard "Steve" Bowen (born February 13, 1964) is a United States Navy submariner and a NASA astronaut; he was the second submariner to travel into space. Bowen has been on four spaceflights, the first three of which were Space Shuttle missions to the International Space Station. His first mission, STS-126, took place in November 2008, and his second was STS-132 in May 2010. His third was STS-133 in February 2011, and his fourth was SpaceX Crew-6 in March 2023.
In March 2011, Bowen completed his third spaceflight as a mission specialist on STS-133, which was Space Shuttle "Discovery"'s final planned flight. Having flown on both STS-132 and STS-133, he became the first and only astronaut to fly on consecutive shuttle missions. Originally Tim Kopra was scheduled to fly on STS-133, but had a bicycle injury shortly before the mission, and so he was replaced by Bowen. On December 16, 2021, NASA assigned Bowen as commander of SpaceX Crew-6 mission to the ISS, launched in March 2023.
Personal life and early education.
Bowen resides in Friendswood, Texas. He is married to Deborah Alden; they have three children. He graduated from Cohasset High School, Cohasset, Massachusetts in 1982, received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the United States Naval Academy in 1986 and received an M.S. in Ocean Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1993. He is a member of Tau Beta Pi, Phi Kappa Phi and Sigma Pi Sigma.
In his spare time, Stephen Bowen has also had connections with the organisation ISSET, through him being the resident astronaut during a few of their Mission Discovery programs. Here he shares his experiences with students as well as try to teach them new skills and influence them to maybe follow a career in the sciences.
Military career.
Upon completion of the submarine training pipeline, Bowen spent three years attached to and completed qualification in submarines on . After attending the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Ocean Engineering he reported to for duty as the Engineering Officer. During this tour, he qualified for command of nuclear powered submarines. In 1997, he reported to the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in the Office of Plans and Policy and worked on the USSOCOM Future Concepts Working Group. For nine months in 1999, he was the Reactor and Propulsion inspector for the Navy's Submarine Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV). In May 2000 he became the first Executive Officer of the Pre-Commissioning Unit , the first of the new s.
NASA career.
Bowen is the first Submarine Officer selected by NASA. He was selected as an astronaut candidate in July 2000, as one of NASA's Astronaut Group 18. He reported for training at the Johnson Space Center in August 2000. Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation, he was initially assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Station Operations Branch while awaiting assignment to a Shuttle flight as a mission specialist. Bowen was originally assigned to STS-124 but was moved to a later flight to allow the Shuttle to rotate an ISS crew member.
STS-126.
Bowen was then assigned to the crew of STS-126, aboard Space Shuttle "Endeavour", which launched November 14, 2008, to the International Space Station. STS-126 carried a reusable logistics module that held supplies and equipment, including additional crew quarters, exercise apparatus, equipment for the regenerative life support system, and spare hardware.
During STS-126, Bowen participated in three spacewalks, for a total time of 19 hours, 56 minutes.
STS-132.
Bowen's next mission was STS-132, aboard Space Shuttle "Atlantis", which launched on May 14, 2010, to the ISS. While docked to the station, Bowen conducted two spacewalks and logged 14 hours and 34 minutes of EVA time.
STS-133.
On January 19, 2011, Bowen was named as the replacement for Timothy L. Kopra on STS-133. Kopra was injured in a bicycle accident, preventing him from flying on the mission. With this mission, Bowen became the first and only astronaut to fly on consecutive Shuttle missions. George Nelson was the first astronaut to fly consecutive Space Shuttle missions in which the Shuttle landed successfully (STS-61-C and STS-26), having the Space Shuttle "Challenger" disaster between his missions. Bowen conducted two spacewalks and logged 12 hours and 48 minutes of EVA time.

Junior Juniper

Jonathan "Junior" Juniper is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, his first appearance was in "Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos" vol. 1 #1. He is known to be the first major character death in a Marvel comic and the only Howling Commando ever to die in battle.
Publication history.
Jonathan "Junior" Juniper appears in "Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos" #1-4. In the fourth issue, he was killed, with his death continuing to haunt Nick Fury all the way up to modern day stories.
In "What If?" #14 (April 1979), an alternate version of the character appears in "What If... Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos Had Fought World War II In Outer Space?".
Fictional character biography.
Jonathan "Junior" Juniper was a founding member of the original Howling Commandos and fought alongside the team during World War II. He was the youngest on the team as he was still attending an unnamed Ivy League college before he enlisted in the Air Force. Juniper was later transferred from the Air Force to the Commandos because he had flown B-17 Flying Fortress in bombing raids as a tail gunner.
Juniper saves the group on its first mission. The group was surrounded by Nazis. As they were waiting in the snow, Juniper read the Biblical story of Gideon frightening his enemy with raucous noise. The commando stole a sound trunk and used its loudspeakers to frighten the Nazis with their cries. With this mission, the group earns the nickname "Howling Commandos"
With the Howling Commandos, Juniper participated at a rescue mission of the leader of the French Resistance who knows when D-Day is scheduled. In another mission, the Howling Commandos invaded a French coast town to create a diversion while the Allied navy destroyed the German U-boat pens. After, they are reassigned on a mission to destroy a German atomic energy research facility. In the process, they also end up liberating a concentration camp.
Nick Fury had a relation with Pamela Hawley, a British countess. During a rescue mission to bring back Percy Hawley known as Lord Ha-Ha, her brother and Nazi sympathizer, Junior was killed. Fury put the blame for Juniper's death on himself, thinking he did not push the Commandos enough. Fury decided to deepen their training until they become the toughest, most dangerous squad in the war. A few missions later, the British soldier, Percival Pinkerton, replaced Juniper in the team. Jonathan Juniper was the grand-uncle of S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Roger Juniper.
Abilities and accessories.
Junior Juniper was a trained commando and an ace tailgunner on a B-17. He is proficient with a knife, grenade, dynamite, and Thompson Submachine gun M1.
Death impact.
Jonathan "Junior" Juniper was killed in action after a few issues of "Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos". As the magazine "Jack Kirby Collector" wrote in 1999, "Today that's no big deal but in 1963, comics heroes simply didn't die; not permanently, anyway. Suddenly, with the death of 'Junior' Juniper, the series acquired some real cachet. It now played like a true-life war drama where people got killed and never came back. You wondered who would be next".
This question is clearly written in the comic book when the Howling Commandos react to the death of their youngest member. The character Dino Manelli said "Which of us will be next?" and his teammate Izzy Cohen answered "What's the diff? We're all expendable". Paul Brian McCoy reviewed this issue for Comics Bulletin and considers it as the "best thing Marvel's publishing in 1963". The story "Lord Ha-Ha's Last Laugh!" mixes emotional complexity, action and adventure. This is the first time a main character has actually died in a Marvel Comic. As the comic writer and editor Tom DeFalco told it in an interview, some of the early Marvel fans were startled by the death of "Junior" Juniper.
Alternate versions.
"What If?".
An alternate version of the character appears in "What If... Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos Had Fought World War II In Outer Space?", "What If?" #14 (April 1979). In this reality, the space is divided into the alpha and the beta sectors as the earth was divided into eastern and western fronts during the World War II. Junior Juniper is a member of the Howling Commandos of this reality. They are soldiers of the alpha sector and they received orders from a command computer. Their first mission is to protect the earth station midway against the betans. At the beginning of the attack, their objective was changed, they had to capture a traitor, the Baron Strucker. The villain died into space and the mission was a success.
"X-Men Forever".
A second alternate version of the character appears in "The Fury of the Howling Commandos", "X-Men Forever" vol. 2 #7 (November 2009). During a S.H.I.E.L.D. investigation in South America, the agent Tommy Juniper is killed. Learning this, the S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Nick Fury thought "Not another Juniper. Not again!". Kitty Pryde, Jean Grey, Rogue, Beast, and Nightcrawler join Nick Fury on a second investigation in the South American jungle. The events remembered him another mission with Jonathan Juniper who is the grand-uncle of Tommy, the rest of the Howling Commandos and a Canadian soldier named Logan.

Dale Jackaman

Dale Jackaman (born June 2, 1956 in Montreal, Quebec) is a Canadian politician and anti-tobacco lobbyist.
Early life.
Jackaman, a social democrat, became well known in the 1980s and 1990s as one of the founders and past Executive Director of British Columbia's largest anti-tobacco activist and lobby group, Airspace Non-Smokers' Rights Society. Later renamed Airspace Action on Smoking and Health, the organization advocated for increased regulation of tobacco during a time when smoking was prevalent in the workplace and other indoor public places. Jackaman was a prominent anti-tobacco lobbyist, attacking municipal and provincial politicians for the lack of protections for non-smokers, and was involved in initiating government litigation against the tobacco industry.
Political career.
Jackaman was a candidate in the federal riding of Richmond for the New Democratic Party in the 2004, 2008 and 2011 federal elections, losing to Raymond Chan and then Alice Wong (twice). He also ran in the Provincial riding of Richmond Centre for the New Democratic Party of British Columbia in the 2005 provincial election. Richmond is considered an unwinnable riding for the NDP. Jackaman, while garnering thirty-two percent of the riding's votes, lost his bid against Olga Ilich, who became the BC Liberal Party Labour Minister.
Jackaman is an openly atheist politician. During the 2006 federal election, Jackaman chose to start a third party attack campaign against the evangelical Conservative candidate, Darrel Reid, former President of Focus on the Family. Jackaman attacked Reid for his stated opinions on stem cell research and treatment, gay rights issues, creationism, alleged "hidden agenda" issues and the fact that Reid was muzzled by the Harper Conservatives for his socially conservative views. Jackaman's campaign may have contributed to Reid's losing the election to the Liberal incumbent, Raymond Chan, who would subsequently serve his fourth term in Parliament and the new Liberal Official Opposition.
Jackaman has appeared on radio and television shows as a guest commentator, including national TV spots on the Vision TV network with debates on religion in politics being a common theme. A common thread to Jackaman's opinions are support for life extension technologies and attacks on the federal Conservatives on separation of church and state issues, muzzling of federal scientists, and governmental decisions on science and technology.
Professional career.
Through the 1990s to 2004, Jackaman served as the Director of Information Systems and was a senior manager at BC Research Inc., western Canada's largest privately owned scientific research and development facility. Jackaman, a licensed private investigator specializing in cybersecurity and other hi-tech investigations, became well-known in various professional and activist circles, notably in the field of computer security. He used this prominence to criticize governments – primarily China and the governing Conservative Party of Canada – on issues relating to human rights, censorship, muzzling of scientists, security, privacy of information, and separation of church and state.
Jackaman previously served as a director of the B.C. Humanist Association, an organization that promotes secularism and progressive values.
Jackaman later became the president of Amuleta Computer Security Inc., a hi-tech private investigator and security consulting firm.
Military career.
Jackaman, a former reservist and United Nations peacekeeper, served three tours of duty in the Middle East with the Canadian Armed Forces Signal Corps.
Personal life.
Jackaman lives in Richmond, British Columbia, with his wife and daughter. He is a federally licensed amateur radio operator. He serves the community with his hobby.
Jackaman is an atheist.

Grand Prix de Deauville

The Grand Prix de Deauville is a Group 2 flat horse race in France open to thoroughbreds aged three years or older. It is run at Deauville over a distance of 2,500 metres (about 1 mile and 4½ furlongs), and it is scheduled to take place each year in August.
History.
The event was established in 1866, and it was originally called the Coupe de Deauville. It was initially contested over 2,400 metres.
The race was renamed the Grand Prix de Deauville in 1871. It was opened to foreign horses in 1872, and was subsequently won by international contenders such as Kincsem and Tristan. Its distance was increased to 2,500 metres in 1886, and to 2,600 metres in 1903.
The event was known as the Grand Prix de Trouville-Deauville from 1908 to 1911. It was abandoned throughout World War I, with no running from 1914 to 1918.
The Grand Prix de Deauville was cancelled once during World War II, in 1940. For the remainder of this period, while its regular venue was closed, it was switched between Longchamp (1941–42, 1945), Maisons-Laffitte (1943) and Le Tremblay (1944). The Longchamp and Maisons-Laffitte editions were contested over 2,500 metres.
The race's distance was extended to 2,700 metres in 1973. Its present length, 2,500 metres, was introduced in 1990.

Eric Koenig

Eric Koenig is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He first appeared in "Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos" #27 (February 1966) and he was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Dick Ayers. He is most commonly in association with the Howling Commandos and S.H.I.E.L.D.
Patton Oswalt portrayed the character in the first season of the TV series "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.". After Koenig is killed, Oswalt continued to portray his identical brothers Billy, Sam, and Thurston and grandfather Ernest throughout the remaining seasons.
Publication history.
Eric Koenig's first appearance was in "Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos" vol. 1 #27 (February 1966), and he was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Dick Ayers.
Eric Koenig received an entry in the "All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update" #3 (2007).
Fictional character biography.
Eric Koenig was a member of the original Howling Commandos and fought alongside the team during World War II. He was a pilot as well as a trainer and was a very anti-Nazi German, as the Nazis killed his sister. He was the replacement of Dino Manelli, who was away on a special mission, and then replaced Izzy Cohen when he was a prisoner of war. Upon Cohen's return, Koenig stayed as a member of the team. In issue #65, "Eric Koenig, Traitor!", Koenig seemed to have been exposed as a Gestapo plant, and his apparent treachery was part of the storyline from then on. This later turned out to have been a complicated double agent operation by the High Command, and in issue #79, Koenig was finally confirmed to be a loyal fighter for the Allies.
After the war, Koenig was one of the Howlers that joined Nick Fury in forming S.H.I.E.L.D. A Life Model Decoy of Koenig appeared and was part of the Deltite affair, but destroyed itself after being captured and scanned by Tony Stark.
When S.H.I.E.L.D. was decommissioned and its agents auto-transferred to the newly founded H.A.M.M.E.R. during the "Dark Reign" storyline, Eric remained with H.A.M.M.E.R. This was despite the fact that 1200 agents who were Fury loyalists (including Dum Dum Dugan and Gabriel Jones) resigned and formed the Howling Commandos PMC. It later transpired that he was working for them from within, and aided in a heist that saw the HCPMC (now owned by Fury) raid a number of H.A.M.M.E.R. Helicarriers, and bolstering their ranks when over 3000 H.A.M.M.E.R. agents defected to their side. He is later killed in a battle against HYDRA. Gabriel Jones is also one of the many S.H.I.E.L.D. fatalities along with Eric.
In other media.
Eric Koenig appears in the live-action Marvel Cinematic Universe television series "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.", portrayed by Patton Oswalt. Introduced in the episode "Providence", he was assigned to Nick Fury's secret S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Providence, and assists Phil Coulson and his team following S.H.I.E.L.D.'s downfall until Koenig is murdered off-screen by Hydra double agent Grant Ward. Oswalt returned in the season one finale "Beginning of the End" as Eric's twin brother Billy Koenig, who oversees a S.H.I.E.L.D. base called the "Playground". In addition to appearing as Billy in the second season, Oswalt also portrays Eric and Billy's other brother Sam Koenig in the episode "...Ye Who Enter Here". Sam helps Billy protect Inhuman Raina from Hydra agents until Coulson's team arrive. In the season four episode "Hot Potato Soup", two more Koenig siblings are revealed: Thurston Koenig, a slam poet activist who is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent as he refers to them as a bunch of "sheep" for allowing Eric to die, and an older sister named L.T. Koenig (portrayed by Artemis Pebdani), who got her younger siblings to join S.H.I.E.L.D. and constantly picks on them. Billy, Sam, and L.T. try to hide the "Darkhold" from the Watchdogs and Holden Radcliffe, but they discover too late that Agent Melinda May was replaced by one of Radcliffe's LMDs. By the end of the episode, the Koenigs confirm that they are all human, though they were part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s original LMD program. In the season seven premiere "The New Deal", Coulson's team travel back in time to 1931 New York City and meet the Koenig siblings' grandfather, Ernest "Hazard" Koenig, who runs a speakeasy that goes on to become an asset to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s predecessor, the Strategic Scientific Reserve, and a S.H.I.E.L.D. safehouse under the pseudonym Gemini. Following an encounter with the agents, Ernest discovers his employee, Wilfred "Freddy" Malick, is the father of future Hydra leader, Gideon Malick. In the episode "Know Your Onions", Ernest is given a glimpse of the future when he meets the agents' Chronicom ally Enoch and is brought aboard the agents' airship, "Zephyr One", to help save Freddy from rebel Chronicoms. After the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents leave 1931 to pursue the Chronicoms, Ernest hires a stranded Enoch to become his new bartender in exchange for information on how he, his speakeasy, and his descendants will help S.H.I.E.L.D. in the future.

Grimsby-class sloop

The "Grimsby" class were a class of 13 sloops laid down between 1933 and 1940. Of these, eight were built in the United Kingdom for the Royal Navy, four in Australia for the Royal Australian Navy and one for the Royal Indian Navy. Main armament was initially two guns for RN ships and three for Australian ships, but armament varied considerably between ships, and was increased later.
Losses during World War II were , , , and . Some survivors of this class served into the 1960s. One ship, , is preserved as the headquarters of the Honourable Company of Master Mariners.
Design.
The Royal Navy started to build replacements for the and sloops of the First World War, when the two vessels of the were laid down in 1928, with the similar four-ship laid down in 1929 and the eight ships of the being laid down in 1929–31. All of these ships were designed to combine the convoy-escort role of the Flower class with the minesweeping duties of the Hunt class, being fitted with equipment for both roles. By 1932, however, it became clear that what was needed was ships dedicated to a single role. Development therefore began of the s as a cheaper mass-production minesweeper, while a new class of sloops would be built that was more closely matched to the escort role.
The new class of escort sloops, the "Grimsby" class, had a heavier gun armament than its predecessors, with two 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns mounted fore and aft replacing the guns of the earlier ships. As the 4.7-inch guns were low-angle guns, not suited to anti aircraft use, a single QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun was mounted in "B" position. Four 3-pounder saluting guns completed the ships' gun armament. The ship was powered by two geared steam turbines driving two shafts, fed by two Admiralty 3-drum boilers. This machinery produced and could propel the ships to a speed of .
Eight ships of the class were built for the Royal Navy, being laid down between 1933 and 1935 and completing between 1934 and 1936. The last two ships built for the Royal Navy, and had differing armaments, with "Aberdeen" replacing the 4.7 and 3-inch guns with two 4-inch anti-aircraft guns, and adding a quadruple .50-inch anti-aircraft machine gun mount, while "Fleetwood" had a main gun armament of two twin 4-inch anti-aircraft mounts, with a short-range anti-aircraft armament of four .50 in machine guns.
The Royal Australian Navy also adopted the "Grimsby" class, with two ships being laid down in 1934–35 and completed in 1935–36, with two more ships laid down in 1938–39 and completed in 1940. The first two ships were armed with three single 4-inch anti-aircraft guns, while the third and fourth ships having one twin and one-single 4-inch mount, with short-range armament a quadruple machine gun mount in all four ships.
The armament of most of the class was reinforced during the Second World War, with several gaining additional 4-inch guns, with the close in anti aircraft armament being supplemented by the addition of Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The ships' depth charge complement increased from 15 at the start of the war to 40 for Australian ships and up to 90 for Royal Navy ships, while several ships were also refitted with a Hedgehog anti-submarine projector.

Guafo Island

Guafo Island is a Chilean island located southwest of Chiloé Island and northwest of Chile's Chonos Archipelago. This location and the prevailing westerly winds bring frequent rainstorms to the island. Ocean currents bring an abundance of fish into this area, making it one of the most productive marine areas in the Southern Pacific Ocean. Because of this, numerous marine vertebrates such as fur seals, sea lions and penguins come to the island to feed and reproduce. Guafo Island has been recently purchased (june 2025) by Rewild Organization as also reported by Actor Leonardo DiCaprio, in order to preserve it from mining and timber logging and to ensure biodiversity preservation. 
Biodiversity.
Guafo Island is characterized by a high biodiversity that includes the largest breeding colony of South American fur seals ("Arctophoca australis") on Chilean coasts, a large population of South American sea lions ("Otaria byronia"), and a reproductively active population of marine otters ("Lontra felina"), a critically endangered species. Recently the coasts of the island have been indicated as an important feeding area of blue whales ("Balaenoptera musculus"), Southern right whale ("Eubalaena australis"), humpback whales ("Megaptera novaeangliae") and transient killer whales ("Orcinus orca"). Among seabird highlights is the largest breeding colony of sooty shearwater ("Puffinusgriseus") in the world (Reyes-Arriagada et al. 2007) as well as important nesting sites of Magellanic penguins ("Spheniscus magellanicus") and occasional sightings of Humboldt penguins ("Spheniscus humboldti"). Historical data also shows that the Island was within the itinerary of HMS "Beagle" in 1835, during the Second voyage of HMS Beagle. Guafo Island has been considered within areas that are critical for marine conservation by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
Lighthouse.
The lighthouse was built in 1907 by George Slight and its rotating four-man crews who serve four months on station is the only permanent population in the island. The lighthouse itself is only 8 meters tall, but the light is 144 meters above the sea.
In popular culture.
The island is also an object of a popular Internet meme. The island gained popularity on TikTok after a user posted a video showing this island being for sale. Members of "Floptok", a TikTok subculture that spawned out of the Stan Twitter community, claim Guafo Island as the location of the imaginary nation of "Floptropica" and have created an extensive folklore around it. Millions of people today identify as "Floptok" citizens. There are websites, social media pages, articles and music dedicated to this internet meme.

Percival "Pinky" Pinkerton is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character's first appearance was in "Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos" #8 (July 1964), in which he replaced Jonathan Junior Juniper who was killed in issue #4. He was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby.
Pinky Pinkerton was portrayed by Richard Short, in the TV series "Agent Carter" which is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Fictional character biography.
Percival "Pinky" Pinkerton was an English member of the original Howling Commandos who fought alongside the team during World War II. A British Army commando and gentleman ranker who used an umbrella as a weapon along with his Thompson submachine gun, Pinkerton had served alongside the unit commander Captain Samuel Happy Sam Sawyer prior to Pearl Harbor when both were with the British Commandos.
Along with Col Timothy Dum Dum Dugan and Dino Manelli, he helped organize the "Deadly Dozen".
Though never explained in the series, Pinkerton wore a Carlist Requetés type red beret with a yellow tassel with his battledress that may have involved service in the Spanish Civil War. Pinkerton also wore his battle dress with an open collar with scarf rather than having the buttoned collar of a British other rank.
In issue #23 ("The Man Who Failed") of "Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos", Percy's older brother, Lieutenant Colonel Pinkerton appeared. The story, set in Burma revealed that Pinkerton came from an English family with a long tradition of service as officers to the Crown. Why Pinkerton never accepted a commission was explained as his living a playboy womanizing life style during his initial military training that led him to be unable to catch up with his studies and resigning.
In the first "Sgt Fury" Annual taking place with the Howlers (Howling Commandos) being recalled up to service in the Korean War, Pinkerton was a sergeant as were all the other former private soldiers of the unit. At the time of their 1966 Vietnam War mission ("Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos" Annual #3) Pinkerton was managing a Playboy Club in London.
Pinkerton, Izzy Cohen and Dino Manelli had a reunion with Fury aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.
As with several other members of the Howling Commandos, Pinkerton joined S.H.I.E.L.D. He later dies from cancer, with Dum Dum Dugan at his side.
Pinkerton and the Essex Regiment.
Pinkerton wore Essex Regiment shoulder flashes on his battledress. The battalion that Lt. Colonel Pinkerton led was referred to as the "Burma Dragons". During the Burma Campaign the Essex Regiment were part of the Chindits. A famous member of the regiment was Arthur Percival, who was commissioned into the regiment in 1916 and achieved fame as a Regimental Intelligence Officer. He later commanded the Imperial Garrison at Singapore, surrendering his command to the Japanese in 1942.
Ancestry.
Three ancestors of Percy were mentioned in Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos. These include:
Character basis.
In a 2002 interview with the Traditional Values Coalition's executive director Andrea Sheldon Lafferty about the latest incarnation of the comic book character of the Rawhide Kid, who was now homosexual, Stan Lee said, "years ago [a comic book] that I did, "Sgt Fury", ...had a gay character. One member of the platoon was called, I think, Percy Pinkerton. He was gay. We didn't make a big issue of it. In this comic book that I read, the word gay wasn't even used. He's just a colorful character who follows his own different drummer. He follows a different beat. But we're not proselytizing for gayness". In a 2005 interview, however, Lee stated that Pinkerton came off as being gay, but that "it wasn't purposely done that way".
In "Sgt Fury" #23 Pinkerton was portrayed as a playboy. Artist Dick Ayers said in an interview that Lee told him to base Pinkerton on actor David Niven.

Curtis McDonald

Curtis McDonald (born 24 March 1988) is a Welsh footballer who plays as a left-sided defender.
Club career.
Born in Cardiff, Curtis made his debut for Cardiff City on 30 April 2006 against Coventry City in the Football League Championship. On 24 November, he joined Accrington Stanley on loan, making one appearance during a 2–0 defeat to Doncaster Rovers in the Football League Trophy as a substitute replacing Andy Todd. He returned to the Bluebirds, coming off the bench to score two goals, including the winner, on his Cardiff City debut, away at Carmarthen Town in the FAW Premier Cup but, at the end of the 2006–07 season he was released by Cardiff.
After a few months playing for Welsh Premier League side Carmarthen Town, he moved to Poland, joining MKS Swit, alongside fellow Welshman Gianluca Palladino, in an arrangement with M&amp;M sports management. He stated that his aim was to return to England during the November break in Poland and earn a deal at a Football League club.
He eventually returned to Britain and signed a 6-month deal at Forest Green Rovers, linking up with former Cardiff teammate Stuart Fleetwood. He made his debut in a 1–1 draw with Kettering Town on 9 August 2008 and stayed on for the 2008–09 campaign at The New Lawn on non-contract terms and signed on for the following season when again offered a contract to stay.
McDonald left the club at the end of the 2009–10 season and trialled with Football League sides, Stockport County and Leyton Orient, however he did not earn a contract and re-joined Forest Green. He celebrated his return by scoring the third goal in a 4–3 victory for Rovers against Hayes &amp; Yeading United.
On 28 December 2010, he signed for fellow Conference National side Newport County. His spell with Newport was disappointing however and in March 2011 McDonald re-signed for Forest Green on loan. This move was made permanent on 31 May 2011 when he signed a one-year contract with the Nailsworth club.
A lengthy injury lay off saw McDonald miss the majority of the 2011–12 season. After returning to fitness, McDonald was loaned out to Brackley Town and made his debut on 7 April 2012 against Hemel Hempstead Town. McDonald went on to become part of the Brackley team that were crowned Southern Premier Division champions as a draw with Oxford City on 21 April 2012 was enough to earn the club promotion.

Harley-Davidson WLA

The Harley-Davidson WLA is a Harley-Davidson motorcycle that was produced to US Army specifications in the years during and around World War II. It was based on an existing civilian model, the WL, and is of the 45 solo type, so called due to its engine displacement and single-rider design. It acquired the nickname "Liberator" in Europe.
Model designation.
The model number breaks down as follows:
History.
Harley-Davidson began producing the WLA in small numbers in 1940, as part of a general military expansion. The later entry of the United States into World War II saw significantly increased production, with some 70,000 being produced during the war (along with spare parts the equivalent of many more). Harley-Davidson would also produce a close WLA variant for the Canadian Army called the WLC and would also supply smaller numbers to the UK, South Africa and other allies, as well as filling orders for different models from the Navy and Marine Corps.
Unusually, all the WLAs produced after Pearl Harbor, regardless of the actual year, would be given serial numbers indicating 1942 production. Thus, war-time machines would come to be known as 42WLAs. This may have been in recognition of the continued use of the same specification. Some 20,000 WLCs were produced in 1942 and 1943, and are marked 42WLC or 43WLC. The precise serial number, as well as casting marks, can be used to date a specific motor accurately, and some other parts bear year and month stamps. Frames and many other parts were not tagged with the serial number, but can be dated by castingnumbers. This is common prior to adoption of the vehicle identification number (VIN).
Many WLAs would be shipped to allies under the Lend-Lease program. The largest recipient was the Soviet Union, which was sold some 30,000 WLAs.
Production of the WLA would cease after the war, but would be revived for the Korean War during the years 1949–1952.
During those post-WWII years two other WLA-variants were built: the 1950 WLH, purposely built for the Dutch MP (Marechaussee).
The 'H' in WLH stood for 'Holland', the model was a crossbred between the 1950 WL and 1943 WLC. Probably some 150 were produced.https://www.hydra-glide.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=9339&amp;start=45
Another variant was the 1951 WLJ, the 'J' stands for either 'Jakarta' or 'Java' (Indonesia), less than 100 produced probably. After the declaration of Independence of Indonesia...and the acceptance of the Dutch government,&lt;ref group="https://www.britannica.com/event/Hague-Agreement"&gt;Dutch%E2%80%93Indonesian Round Table Conference&lt;/ref&gt; the Indonesian Army (TNI,(AP)RIS) had no vehicles other than those that were forced to give up by the withdrawing Dutch army (KNIL).
Most of these transferred vehicles were in bad shape, either worn out or sabotaged, hence the purchase of new motorcycles.
Most WLAs in western hands after the war would be sold as surplus and "civilianized"; the many motorcycles available at very low cost would lead to the rise of the chopper and other modified motorcycle styles, as well as the surrounding biker culture. Many a young soldier would come home hoping to get a Harley-Davidson like he saw or rode in the service, leading to the post-war popularity of both the motorcycle and the company in general.
However, this also ensured that few nearly-original WLAs would survive in the US or even Western Europe. A significant number of WLAs were left in the Soviet Union, and either stored or put in private hands. With little access to parts and no chopper culture, and no export path to the West, many of those WLAs were preserved during the Cold War. Russia and other former Soviet countries are now a major source of WLAs and parts.
Military changes.
The WLA is very similar to civilian models, specifically the WL. Among the changes making it a military model:
Uses.
The US Army would use motorcycles for police and escort work, courier duties, and some scouting, as well as limited use to transport radio and radio suppression equipment. Allied motorcycles were almost never used as combat vehicles or for troop mobility, and so were rarely equipped with sidecars as was common on the German side.
The WLAs in Soviet service however were often equipped with sidecars and were used as battle vehicles in the frontlines. Nevertheless, the WLA acquired the nickname "Liberator", since it was seen ridden by soldiers liberating occupied Europe.
Technology.
The engine of the WLA is a side-valve design, which is reliable though not particularly efficient in comparison to overhead-valve designs. Harley-Davidson already had overhead valve engines in production for its Big Twin lines, but the "small twin" flathead design was popular in applications needing low cost and reliability more than power. This engine remained in production from 1937 to 1973 in the Servi-Car, although it was superseded in two-wheeled motorcycles by the more advanced flathead engine used in the Model K in 1952, the short-lived ancestor engine of the OHV Sportster from 1957.
Though the model designation suggested high compression, for reliability, the Army version actually used a medium-compression version. In modern terms, the WLA's compression ratio of 5:1 is very low. Due to this low compression ratio, a WLA will run on 74 octane gasoline.
The WLA also features springer front suspension. Harley-Davidson would not adopt telescopic front forks until after the war. The rear wheel had no suspension, giving this type of motorcycle the nickname "hard tail".
Other military motorcycles.
Harley-Davidson provided motorcycles to the Army during World War I and for earlier excursions against Mexican revolutionaries such as Pancho Villa.
During World War II, the Army produced a specification for a motorcycle much like the BMWs used by German forces. That meant shaft drive, a boxer engine, and several other features that made the BMWs exceptionally reliable and low-maintenance machines. Harley-Davidson produced the XA based closely on the BMW. About 1,000 were produced. Due to its new features and low production, the XA was expensive, and by that time it was clear that the Jeep was the Army's general purpose vehicle of choice; the less advanced but cheaper WLA was considered sufficient for its limited roles.
Other motorcycles produced by HD for World War II included US Army and Canadian versions of the Big Twin EL family, the ELA and ELC, as well as an Army version of the U, the UA. There was also an experimental three-wheeler TA with a 69 ci EL-motor.
These were produced mainly for "home front" use, and not in very large numbers. Consequently, they are very rare today.
Indian, Harley-Davidson's major competitor at the time, also produced some war-time models, such as the Indian 640, Indian CAV/340, Indian 741, and a longitudinal V-twin shaft-drive model, the Indian 841.
Harley-Davidson would later produce the MT350E, after acquiring the British Armstrong company in 1987. These were dual-sport machines, capable of both on-road and off-road service, powered by 350 cc Rotax engines. The MT350E was a redesign of the 500 cc Armstrong MT500, which reduced weight, added an electric start, and upgraded pollution standards. The MT500 began as the Italian SWM XN Tornado, which Armstrong acquired the rights to in 1984 when SWM liquidated, and then modified for military use with assistance from CCM. The MT350E mostly saw British and Canadian service, and some are still in use.

Happy Sam Sawyer

General Samuel "Happy Sam" Sawyer is a character that appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. His first appearance was in "Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos" #1.
Publication history.
Sawyer was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. He first appeared in "Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos" #1, May 1963. He was named after Stan Sawyer, a friend of Stan Lee in Hewlett Bay Park and a notable VoiceOver artist for commercials (Salem cigarettes, Hertz Rentacar Certs and many others) in NYC. Stan and Sheila Sawyer socialized with Stan and Joan in the early 60s, and Stan used his name for the character.
Fictional character biography.
Happy Sam Sawyer was assigned to the British Commandos by the U.S. Army. He trained for parachuting in Britain in 1940 with Finley's Flying Circus, alongside daredevil parachutist Nick Fury and pilot Red Hargroves. They gave him the nickname “Happy Sam” because of his serious and consistently stony demeanor. In 1942, Sawyer, who had been wounded in North Africa and was deemed unfit for combat missions, organized and led the Howling Commandos, Bull McGiveney's Maulers, Jim Morita's Nisei Squad, and Sgt. Bob Jenkin's The Missouri Marauders, as well as the Deadly Dozen. When artist John Severin joined "Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos" with issue #44, Severin drew Sawyer as being much older and balder than his original depiction as a young man.
In a Sgt Fury annual set in the Korean War, Sawyer was a Colonel, and in another annual set in the Vietnam War, Sawyer was a full general.
In modern times, Baron Strucker created an LMD of Sawyer that attacked the original Howling Commandos as well as Captain America. Sawyer would sacrifice himself when the LMD detonated itself while trying to gain missile navigation override codes.
In the wake of his death, a S.H.I.E.L.D. assault Helicarrier was named in his honor in the mini-series "Iron Man: Hypervelocity". There is also a Samuel J. Sawyer Memorial Veterans Hospital.

Old Queens

Old Queens is the oldest extant building at Rutgers University and is the symbolic heart of the university's campus in New Brunswick in Middlesex County, New Jersey in the United States. Rutgers, the eighth-oldest college in the United States, was founded in 1766 during the American colonial period as Queen's College. Queen's College was named for Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the daughter of a German duke who became the queen consort of British king George III. Old Queens is located on a six-acre hilltop city block bounded by Somerset Street, Hamilton Street, College Avenue and George Street that was previously an apple orchard. Donated to the college in 1807 by James Parker, Jr., this city block become known the Queen's Campus and is the historic core of the university. Because of this, by metonymy, the name "Old Queens" came to be used as a reference to Rutgers College and is often invoked as an allusive reference to the university or to its administration.
Designed by American architect John McComb Jr., who also designed New York City Hall, the cornerstone of Old Queens was laid in 1809 by the college's third president, the Rev. Ira Condict. Due to financial constraints, construction was not completed until 1825. In its early days, Old Queens provided instruction space for lectures, student and faculty housing, a college library, and a chapel that was shared by three institutions: the college, its grammar school (today, Rutgers Preparatory School), and the New Brunswick Theological Seminary. Today, Old Queens houses the university's administration including the offices of its president and governing boards.
Old Queens was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historical Landmark on May 11, 1976 for its significance in architecture and education. It is regarded as a fine example of Federal architecture on a college campus. Queen's Campus, including Old Queens, was added to the NRHP on July 2, 1973.
History.
Early history (1766–1808).
Chartered on 10 November 1766, Queen's College was initially a small, private liberal arts college affiliated with the Dutch Reformed church founded "for the education of youth in the learned languages, liberal and useful arts and sciences, and especially in divinity; preparing them for the ministry and other good offices." It is the eighth-oldest college in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. Queen's College was named for Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the daughter of a German duke who became the queen consort of British king George III. The college first held its classes in a tavern called "The Sign of the Red Lion" on the corner of Nielson and Albany Streets in New Brunswick, and later at a building on George Street in city's current business district, before moving the college to the hilltop where they would begin to build Old Queens in 1809.
During the Revolution the hilltop where Old Queens was built was the site of a redoubt where Alexander Hamilton, then an artillery captain commanding sixty men of the New York Provincial Company of Artillery, placed his cannons to cover the retreat of George Washington's forces after the British occupation of New York. After the British victory in taking Fort Washington in November 1776, Washington's forces retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania. Hamilton's battery protected the forces as they crossed the Raritan River and passing through New Brunswick in 1776. British forces commanded by Lieutenant General Lord Cornwallis under orders from Lieutenant General William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe pursued Washington as far as New Brunswick.
The hill belonged to John Parker, a prominent merchant from nearby Perth Amboy and was the site of an apple orchard. His heirs, including James Parker, Jr. (1776–1868), a local merchant and political figure, donated this orchard to the trustees of Queen's College (later renamed Rutgers) in 1808. James Parker, Jr., a graduate of Columbia College (A.B. 1793) in New York, was a member of the New Jersey General Assembly, and later became a trustee of Queen's and later Rutgers College starting in 1812 and serving until his death in 1868. The college, which had closed in 1795 due to financial reasons, reopened in 1807 after a long fundraising campaign led by the Rev. Ira Condict (the school's third president, "pro tempore") and the Rev. John Henry Livingston (the college's fourth president and founder of the New Brunswick Theological Seminary) with direct support from the Dutch Reformed Church's Synod of New York. The funds would be appropriated to build a permanent home for Queen's College, its grammar school (which remained open for the years the college closed), and Livingston's theological seminary which was permanently relocated to New Brunswick from New York.
Construction (1808-1825).
The trustees hired New York architect John McComb Jr. (1763–1853) to design and oversee the construction of Old Queens. McComb was known for his designs of the Cape Henry Light (1792) in Chesapeake Bay, and for Montauk Point Lighthouse (1796) and Station Eatons Neck Lighthouse (1798) at the eastern end of Long Island, and for several New York City landmarks including Gracie Mansion (1799), Hamilton Grange (1802), New York City Hall (1803), and St. John's Chapel (1803, demolished 1918). He would subsequently design Lower Manhattan's Castle Clinton (1808) and Alexander Hall at Princeton Theological Seminary (1815).
The cornerstone for Old Queens was laid on 27 April 1809 by Queen's College's president, the Rev. Ira Condict. Construction was overseen by Abraham Blauvelt, publisher of the local newspaper ""The Guardian, or, New Brunswick Advertiser"." Some the actual physical construction work was done by enslaved persons, including a man named Will who was owned by longtime New Brunswick physician Dr. Jacob Dunham. In recent years, scholarship on the relationship between enslavement and universities has become significantly more publicized. Rutgers has since erected a sign honoring Will’s work and named the brick pathway to the building “Will’s Walk”. This effort acknowledges that slavery was a real part of life in New Brunswick through the nineteenth century.
Due to the young college's financial difficulties, the building was not completed until 1825. Classes began within the completed portions of the building as early as 1811 for Queen's College (now Rutgers University), Queen's College Grammar School (now Rutgers Preparatory School), and the New Brunswick Theological Seminary. The New Brunswick Theological Seminary moved in 1856 to a new campus less than one-half mile away, as a result of overcrowding. The Grammar School had moved across the street several years earlier in 1830.
In 1825, Colonel Henry Rutgers, an American Revolutionary War Hero and philanthropist from New York City gave the fledgling Queens College a $5,000 bond and a bell. The Trustees renamed the institution in honor of Colonel Rutgers. The bell, known as the Old Queens Bell, was hung in the cupola of Old Queens to chime the passing of classes. It remains there today, and is rung on special occasions, such as at Commencement exercise in May and in recognition of athletic teams who have won national conferences. The cupola was donated by Stephen Van Rensselaer in 1825.
Use.
Initially, Old Queens housed the entire College functionality. The first floor of Old Queens served as classrooms where recitation was held and the second floor housed the college's chapel and library.
The wings on each side of the structure served as living quarters for the faculty of the College. At the time, with no dormitories (until the construction of Winants Hall 1890), students at Rutgers found housing within boarding houses and other off-campus locations throughout New Brunswick.
Today, Old Queens houses the offices of the university president and other top administration. As Rutgers expanded, Old Queens has remained the flagship structure of the University. It houses the highest administrative offices and conference spaces. Old Queens is frequently used as the face of the University in its media and advertising, paying tribute to its architectural and academic significance.
Architecture.
Constructed of ashlar brownstone in the front and sides and of local field stone in the rear, the façade of Old Queens incorporates symmetry and balance typical of Federal style architecture, and classical motifs such as Doric pilasters, and low-height pediments (or tympanum or gables) resembling those on ancient Greek and Roman temples typical to the Early American period. The regularized brownstone on the facade is the most expensive style of New Jersey Dutch tradition.
Old Queens boasts its original handmade glass windowpanes. The lower floor windows are 12x8, with 16x12 on the second and 12x12 third floors. In each of the gables, circular windows, typical to Federal architecture are present.
A cupola erected in 1825, topped by a weathervane, houses the Old Queens Bell donated by Colonel Henry Rutgers. Its exterior maintains almost entirely the same appearance it had at its construction. The facade of Old Queens remains recognizable to Rutgers students from the nineteenth century through today.
Queen's Campus.
Old Queens is the oldest building and the centerpiece of the six extant building which constitute the "Queen's Campus". The historic core of the university, it contains the university's oldest buildings. While the Old Queens building obtained a discrete separate listing on the National Register of Historic Places for landmark status in 1976, the entire six-acre campus with these six remaining buildings was included together as one historic site on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places on January 29, 1973, and on the National Register of Historic Places on July 2, 1973. These six buildings are:
A seventh building, the former "President's House" (built in 1841), was demolished in 1948 after damage sustained during a hurricane. Used as the residence of the college's president in the nineteenth century, it was later used as a fine arts building before it was razed.
The Old Queens campus is accessed through four gateways, the "Henry Rutgers Baldwin Gateway" (erected 1901) on College Avenue, named for Henry Rutgers Baldwin (Class of 1849), the "Class of 1883 Memorial Gateway" (erected in 1904) at the corner of George and Somerset Streets, the "Class of 1882 Gateway" (erected 1907) at the corner of Somerset Street and College Avenue, and the "Class of 1902 Memorial Gateway" (erected in 1904) on Hamilton Street leading to the Voorhees Mall and the academic buildings on Rutgers University's College Avenue Campus. It is through this last gate that graduating seniors walk during Commencement exercises in May.
Located in front of Old Queens, the "Class of 1877 Cannon" commemorates both the Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War and several alumni who have served in the United States military. As a tradition during commencement, those graduating break clay pipes over the cannon as a symbol of breaking ties with their "pipe dreams" of youth and embarking into adulthood.

The initial core of settlers assembled in 1919 and began training for the establishment of an agricultural settlement. A tract of land was purchased with the funds of the American Zion Commonwealth, and Keren Hayesod acquired equipment. The moshav was founded in 1922, the third to be established in Palestine, and was named after The 1st Earl of Balfour, writer of the Balfour Declaration (who consented to lending his name to the settlement), which embraced Zionist plans for a Jewish "national home". According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Balfouria had a population of 18 Jews. According to a Jewish National Fund publication of 1949, Balfouria was the first village to be founded in Palestine after the Balfour Declaration.
The founders were joined by former kibbutz residents, a number of people from the Co-operative in Merhavia, as well as many settlers from Petah Tikva. The houses and dairy barns built with the funds of the Commonwealth were of concrete and had shingled roofs, thus earning the settlers of Balfouria the sobriquet "the millionaires". Lord Balfour visited the moshav in 1925 and gave the settlers his blessings.
In 1939, the lands of the moshav were transferred to the Jewish National Fund and leasing agreements were signed with Keren Hayesod. In 1934, the settlers completed the digging of a new well which increased agricultural activity in the area. In 1959, the connection with the Mekorot water company was sealed.
Balfouria nature reserve.
North-east of the moshav are an ancient tell and springs - remnants of the Valley's swamps - that were declared a 45-dunam nature reserve, in 1979. Atop of the tell, a monument was erected in honor of the moshav's founders and those who fell in Israel's wars.
Sports.
The local football club, Hapoel Balfouria, spent two seasons in the top division in the mid-1950s. However, they later folded.

Captain Steve

Captain Steve (March 1, 1997 – April 21, 2013) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse. He was bred by Roger Laubach, raised by Cecil "Buddy" Williams, owned by Michael E. Pegram, and trained by Bob Baffert. A Chestnut foal by Fly So Free out of Sparkling Delite (by Vice Regent), he started 25 times, and earned $6,828,356.
Racing history.
At age 2, Captain Steve won the 1999 Grade II Breeders' Futurity Stakes, the Grade I Hollywood Futurity, and the Grade II Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes. He came in third in the Grade II Del Mar Futurity and the Grade III Best Pal Stakes.
At age 3, he won the 2000 Grade I Swaps Stakes, the Grade II Kentucky Cup Classic Handicap, and the Iowa Derby. He placed in the Grade I Haskell Invitational Handicap and the Grade II Goodwood Handicap, and came in third in the Grade I Breeders' Cup Classic, the Grade I Santa Anita Derby, the Grade II Louisiana Derby, and the Grade II Santa Catalina Stakes. Captain Steve finished eighth behind winner Fusaichi Pegasus in the 2000 Kentucky Derby.
At age 4, he won the Grade I Donn Handicap and the Group I Dubai World Cup. (UAE) He placed in the then-Grade II Stephen Foster Handicap, and showed in the Grade III San Diego Handicap.
From his 25 starts, he won 9, placed three times, and showed seven times.
Stud period.
In 2001, he was sold to the Japan Racing Association for $5,000,000 to stand at Shizunai Stud for 1,800,000 Yen.
Origin of name.
Captain Steve is named after Captain Steve Thompson, the head of the Louisville Police Department's criminal investigation division in 1997. After attending the 1997 Kentucky Derby, owner Michael E. Pegram received a birthday present from his girlfriend. He didn't unwrap the present, which contained a gun, prior to attempting to clear security at the Louisville International Airport the day after the Derby and police arrested Pegram for possession of a .357 Magnum. Pegram's best friend, trainer Bob Baffert, winner of the Kentucky Derby the previous day with Silver Charm, called the Louisville Police Department and spoke with Captain Thompson. After listening to Baffert's story, Captain Thompson intervened with the presiding judge, drove to the police station and picked up Pegram. When the 1997 chestnut son of Fly So Free came along, Pegram is reported as saying, "I want to name him Captain Steve, after my savior."
Death.
Captain Steve died on April 21, 2013, at Schichinohe Stallion Station in northern Japan from acute heart failure. He was 16.

Tenzin Palmo

Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo (born 1943) is a bhikṣuṇī in the Drukpa Kagyu lineage of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. She is an author, teacher and founder of the Dongyu Gatsal Ling Nunnery in Himachal Pradesh, India. She is best known for being one of the very few Western yoginis trained in the East, having spent twelve years living in a remote cave in the Himalayas, three of those years in strict meditation retreat.
Vicki Mackenzie, who wrote "Cave in the Snow" about her, relates that what inspired the writing of the book was reading Tenzin Palmo's statement to a Buddhist magazine that "I have made a vow to attain Enlightenment in the female form - no matter how many lifetimes it takes".
Early life.
Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo was born Diane Perry in Woolmers Park, Hertfordshire, England, on 30 June 1943. Although spiritualist meetings were held in her childhood home, she realised at the age of 18 that she was a Buddhist when she read a library book on the subject. She moved to India at 20, where she taught English at the Young Lamas Home School for a few months before meeting her root lama, the 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche.
Career.
In 1964 she became the second Western woman to be ordained in the Vajrayana tradition, receiving the name Drubgyu Tenzin Palmo, or "Glorious Lady who Upholds the Doctrine of the Practice Succession". The ordination was as a śrāmaṇerī, or novice nun, the highest level of ordination available for women in the Tibetan tradition at the time because the bhikṣuṇī sangha had never been established there. However, with the support of her teacher, in 1973 Tenzin Palmo received the full bhikṣuṇī ordination in Hong Kong, one of the first Western women to do so.
Living at Khamtrul Rinpoche's monastery as the sole nun among 100 monks provided Tenzin Palmo with first-hand experience of the discrimination that restricted women's access to information that was imparted freely to men. Eager for instruction, she felt frustrated by the fact that she was kept out of most monastic activities because of misogynistic prejudices. She recounts,
This phase lasted for six years. Then Tenzin Palmo left the monastery at her teacher's suggestion to go to Lahaul in the higher reaches of the Indian Himalayas, where she would eventually enter the cave and launch herself into uninterrupted, intense spiritual practice.
The cave.
In 1976 Tenzin Palmo commenced living in a cave in the Himalayas measuring 10 feet wide and six feet deep and remained there for 12 years, for three of which she was in full retreat. The cave was high in the remote Lahaul area of the Indian Himalayas (nearby Tayul Gompa), on the border of Himachal Pradesh and Tibet. In the course of the retreat she grew her own food and practised deep meditation based on ancient Buddhist methods. In accordance with protocol, she never lay down, sleeping in a traditional wooden meditation box in a meditative posture for just three hours a night. The last three years were spent in complete isolation. She survived temperatures of below −30°F (−35°C) and snow for six to eight months of the year.
Activism.
Tenzin Palmo emerged from the cave in 1988 and travelled to Italy as visa problems meant she needed to leave India. Since her retreat Tenzin Palmo has taken on the cause of equal rights and opportunities for Buddhist nuns. In support of this, she spent several years travelling the world fundraising for a new Buddhist nunnery, as her root lama had asked her to do. In 2000, the Dongyu Gatsal Ling Nunnery was opened with the purpose of giving education and training to women from Tibet and the Himalayan border regions. At this nunnery, Tenzin Palmo also plans to re-establish the extinct lineage of togdenmas, a Drukpa Kagyu yogini order.
Tenzin Palmo is a member of the six member "Committee of Western Bhikshunis", an organisation of senior Western nuns supported by two Advisors from Taiwan – the Ven. Bhiksuni Heng-ching Shih, Professor of Philosophy at Taiwan National University [Gelongma ordination 1975 in San Francisco] and Ven. Bhikshuni Wu-yin, Vinaya Master. It was formed in the autumn of 2005, after the Dalai Lama told Bhikshuni Jampa Tsedroen that the Western bhikshunis should be more involved in helping to establish the bhikshuni ordination in the Tibetan tradition.
Tenzin Palmo is a strict vegetarian for ethical reasons.
Recognition.
On 16 February 2008, Tenzin Palmo received the title of "Jetsunma" (reverend lady) in recognition of her spiritual achievements as a nun and her efforts in promoting the status of female practitioners in Tibetan Buddhism by the head of the Drukpa Lineage, the 12th Gyalwang Drukpa.
In November 2023, Tenzin Palmo was named to the BBC's 100 Women list, which features 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world.

Ultralight backpacking

Ultralight backpacking (sometimes written as UL backpacking) is a style of lightweight backpacking that emphasizes carrying the lightest and least amount of gear. While no technical standards exist, some hikers consider "ultralight" to mean an initial base weight of less than . Base weight is the weight of a fully loaded backpack at the start of a trip, excluding worn weight and consumables such as food, water, and fuel (which vary depending on the duration and style of trip). Base weight can be lowered by reducing the weight of individual items of gear, or by choosing not to carry that gear. Ultralight backpacking is popular among thru-hikers.
In the United States, the terms "light" and "ultralight" often refer to backpackers who carry gear with a base weight below respectively. These weights are more easily achievable for smaller hikers. Larger hikers may need to carry clothes, shelters, sleep systems and backpacks that weigh up to 50% more. In contrast, traditional backpackers have base weights of , and in some cases (usually winter trips, extended trips in varying conditions, and multi-purpose trips requiring additional gear such as photography, fishing, and climbing) as much as or more.
History.
Ultralight backpacking was popularized by American rock climber Ray Jardine, whose 1992 book "PCT Hiker's Handbook", later retitled as "Beyond Backpacking" in 1999, laid the foundations for many techniques that ultralight backpackers use today. Jardine claimed his first Pacific Crest Trail thru-hike was with a base weight of , and by his third PCT thru-hike it was below .
Before modern equipment made it possible for ultralight hikers to buy most of their light-weight gear, there were hikers who adhered to an "ultralight" mentality. In the late 1800s, George W. Sears (a.k.a. "Nessmuk") hiked and paddled through the Appalachian territory with only a waxed canvas tarpaulin, walking stick / ridgepole, a small pan, and his trademark dual-bladed hatchet. He laid the foundations of ultra-light backpacking in his concise 1884 book, "Woodcraft", which is still in print today.
Another 'early pioneer' was Grandma Gatewood, who thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail in 1955 with only a duffel bag containing an army blanket, a plastic sheet, an umbrella, and other very simple gear that was much lighter than the heavy equipment common among hikers in those days.
Philosophy and process.
Ultralight backpackers believe a lower base weight allows them to cover longer distances and reduce stress on their bodies. This is particularly beneficial when thru-hiking a long-distance trail. However, gear made from some light high-performance materials (such as titanium, goose down and DCF) can be more expensive and less durable. Proponents might use the following steps.
The 'big three'.
A hiker's shelter, sleeping system, and backpack are considered to be the three major items for weight reduction.
Shelter.
Tents, hammocks, and tarps with bivy sacks are used by long-distance hikers to protect themselves from insects and weather. Of these, tents are the most common. The development of very lightweight silicone-coated fabrics have allowed manufacturers to produce very lightweight tents. The lightest tents are single wall, but even some double wall tents are very light weight. Weight can be further reduced by using poncho-tarps, or a bivy sack ("Alpine style") as the sole shelter. Generally as weight decreases, the skill needed to shelter safely increases.
Sleeping system.
Ultralight backpackers might opt for foam sleeping pads, which are usually lighter than inflatable mattresses, and rest their head on clothing or other gear rather than carry a pillow.
Narrow 'mummy-style' quilts and sleeping bags are lighter than traditional rectangular-shaped items. Down is lighter than synthetic fibers for insulation, but is susceptible to loft loss caused by moisture. Some quilts are bottom-less, relying on the user's sleeping pad to guard against cold ground. A top bag is more like a conventional sleeping bag in that it wraps around the user's entire body but the bottom fabric contains no insulation. The idea is that bottom insulation is compressed by a person's body, rendering any loft in that area useless. Some modern down sleeping bags are through-baffled and under-filled such that the user can shift all the insulation to the top of their body thereby maximizing its potential to retain heat. Ultralight hikers also tend to carry bags rated for warmer temperatures than traditional-weight backpackers, making up the difference on cold nights by wearing clothes to bed, such as a balaclava or jacket. Careful camping site selection can avoid colder "hollows" (low points where cold air tends to collect) or make use of natural wind barriers such as thick vegetation to compensate for less-warm gear.
Backpack.
With a lighter shelter and sleeping system, the backpack can consist of lighter material and a less bulky frame or no frame at all. A common ultralight alternative to an internal frame pack is a frameless pack made of ripstop nylon, silnylon, or ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene with a carrying limit of around . A large internal-frame pack will usually weigh more than , with features such as hip belts, lifter straps, sternum straps, and compression straps. Ultralight frameless packs can weigh as little as and can consist of not much more than a sack with shoulder straps. Jardine's book includes directions to make your own "ultralight pack".
Some backpackers make their own gear. Advantages include possible reduction of cost and the opportunity to customize the gear to the individual user. Additionally, if a homemade item fails, the hiker will know how to repair it. Lastly, commercial manufacturers often choose heavier, more durable material for their products in order to reduce the amount of care and maintenance required of the user (and minimize returns of damaged gear). With care, homemade lightweight gear can last as long as necessary.
Other gear.
The remaining gear (such as ten essentials and survival kit) carried by an ultralight backpacker follows a similar philosophy of replacing traditional backpacking gear with lighter options. Replacements might include:
Consumables.
In addition to carrying equipment, hikers must also carry consumables such as water and food, and in some cases fuel. Some ultralight backpackers save weight by resupplying these items more frequently. On long-distance trails with multiple access points, some ultralight hikers choose to place food caches or stop at stores to resupply consumables at frequent intervals, allowing just two or three days' worth of food to be carried in place of a larger load.
Water.
Water can be a significant contributor to pack weight because moderate activity in a moderate climate requires of drinking water per day, with a weight of . When traveling through an area with many springs and streams, some ultralight hikers can carry as little as of water, or none at all, provided the hiker is confident on how far away the next reliable water source is and the expected weather conditions, but in other regions hikers must carry all their water requirements, and can only minimize the container weight.
Some ultralight hikers reduce the weight of water purifying devices, carried to prevent waterborne diseases such as giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis and dysentery, by carrying lighter disinfectants instead of filters or ultraviolet (UV) treatment devices. 
Food.
After shelter, a sleeping system, the backpack and water, food is the biggest contributor to pack weight and an area where substantial gains over traditional backpacking can be made.
The basal metabolic rate requirement of food calories (one food calorie is 1000 heat calories, thus sometimes labelled kcal) is approximately 1000 per day per 45kg (100 pounds) of body weight. However hiking consumes additional calories; for example the standard US Army field ration is 4500 kcal per day for strenuous work. Thus depending upon type of food an average hiker carries, a hiker requires approximately of food per day. Ultralight techniques can substantially reduce this weight, Jardine suggests per day for thru-hiking, Jordan suggests per day (at 125 calories per ounce, 4.4 calories per gram) for a 3-season 3-day backpack.
Many foods can be dried or dehydrated to reduce water weight. Dehydrated meals can be purchased or dehydrated at home. On the trail, rehydration can typically be performed by cooking in hot water. Some ultralight hikers reduce weight by not carrying a stove and rehydrating food in a container with ambient-temperature water (although this method requires more time to rehydrate than the traditional cooking method). For example, Ramen noodles, dehydrated refried beans (in powdered form), or dehydrated hummus can be put in a ziploc bag or lightweight microwave disposable plastic container with water to rehydrate. Oats (groats or rolled, granola or muesli) and barley also become soft enough with soaking to eat uncooked as a raw food. Tsampa is a simple, bland and lightweight dish made from flour, and has been used for centuries by wandering Tibetan monks.
Weight can also be reduced by choosing calorie-dense foods. Proteins and carbohydrates have approximately 4 kcal per gram, fat has 9 kcal per gram and water has 0 kcal, thus carrying foods low in water and high in fat content can reduce weight, such as:
Clarified butter (anhydrous), which stores sell unrefrigerated, is almost pure fat (8.76 kcal/gram), thus about 4,000 kcal per pound; however, it is also a potent bear attractant.
Energy bars on average contain more protein and carbohydrates than fat, similar to a fig newton (3.68 kcal/gram), which lowers their calorie to weight ratio relative to other choices.
Food protection.
In some parts of the United States an approved bear-resistant food storage container is a required item for hikers, which will add between and to the base pack weight. These areas include parts of Yosemite National Park, Rocky Mountain National Park and the Eastern High Peaks Zone.

CKKS-FM

CKKS-FM (107.5 FM, "KiSS Throwbacks") is a radio station licensed to Chilliwack, British Columbia, and serving Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley. Owned by Rogers Radio, a division of Rogers Sports &amp; Media, it broadcasts a classic hits format focusing on music from the 1990s through the 2010s.
The station's main studios and offices are at 2440 Ash Street in the Fairview neighbourhood of Vancouver, where its rebroadcasting transmitter CKKS-FM-2 operates at 104.9 FM with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 31,000 watts and a height above average terrain (HAAT) of 672.2 metres (2,205 ft) from atop Mount Seymour. Another rebroadcasting transmitter, 92.5 CKKS-FM-1, is in Abbotsford, British Columbia.
The station went on the air in 1986 as CKSR-FM, with transmitters at Abbotsford and Chilliwack. Technical changes in the late 1990s added a third transmitter in Vancouver, greatly expanding its broadcast coverage.
History.
Star FM in the Fraser Valley.
The station signed on for the first time on October 1, 1986, as CKSR-FM "Star FM". It was the first FM radio service based in the region and was owned by Fraser Valley Broadcasters Ltd., which owned AM stations in Abbotsford and Chilliwack, the pair of CFVR and CHWK. A hybrid easy listening/adult contemporary format aimed at adult audiences was aired by Star FM, with transmitters at 107.5 MHz in Chilliwack and 104.9 MHz in Abbotsford.
Beginning in 1995, CKSR began gradually phasing out its easy listening songs in favor of a pure adult contemporary format. Fraser Valley Broadcasters also analyzed ways to improve its reception in several areas of the western Fraser Valley where its signal remained "unreliable". In 1997, the Abbotsford main transmitter was moved to 104.9 MHz on Mount Seymour, with a new Abbotsford transmitter on 92.5 MHz. While the CRTC did not permit the station to reduce its service to the Fraser Valley, approving the move over objections from several Vancouver radio stations, the move had the consequence of putting the Lower Mainland in its coverage area, and CKSR-FM opened a Vancouver office (without studios, as the CRTC did not allow permanent studios outside the Fraser Valley to be used). The move gave Vancouver three adult contemporary stations: CKSR-FM, CHQM-FM, and CKKS-FM.
Rogers purchase and Xfm.
In 1999, Rogers Broadcasting purchased the Fraser Valley Radio Group of CFVR, CHWK, and CKGO in Hope. The new ownership immediately made cuts at the low-rated Star FM. On December 31, Rogers flipped the station from "Star FM" to alternative rock as CKVX-FM "104.9 Xfm". The choice of format surprised some observers who expected Rogers to go after CHR station CKZZ-FM.
Throughout the run, ratings were low, usually behind competing FM rocker CFOX-FM, but there were some notable moments, including the early playing of the new Radiohead song "Optimistic" in September 2000, which earned a cease-and-desist order from record label EMI after CKVX obtained a recording. Rogers placed the CKSR call sign on the former CHWK and converted it to FM in 2001 as CKSR-FM, adopting the former Star FM's branding, and a similar light rock format.
Clear FM era.
On November 19, 2003, CKVX began stunting with all-Christmas music as "104.9 Christmas FM". At noon on December 26, CKVX switched to "104.9 Clear FM", a hybrid format of adult contemporary and smooth jazz music during most of the day that was designed to complement CKLG-FM (now CJAX-FM) and its Jack FM format. A program of chillout, downtempo and trip hop electronic music called "Vancouver Chills", hosted by Trevor Shand, aired from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. nightly. The first song on "Clear FM" was "Don't Know Why" by Norah Jones. On April 8, 2004, CKVX-FM became CKCL-FM. In 2005, Shand left CKCL to move to Los Angeles to become the production manager at KROQ-FM (while continuing voiceover work for Rogers Broadcasting stations in Vancouver and Toronto). Music Director Doreen Copeland took over as host of "Vancouver Chills", which then began mixing more AC and smooth jazz in with the electronica tunes and expanded its airtime to 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. nightly.
On August 31, 2006, CKCL dropped the smooth jazz and electronic music and returned to a full-time adult contemporary format. Mornings on the revamped Clear FM were helmed by longtime Vancouver broadcaster Fred Latremouille and his wife Cathy, returning to local radio after six years of retirement in Hawaii on September 5. However, after a year, the Latremouilles opted to return to retirement.
In December 2007, management announced that Charlee Morgan, formerly of Calgary's CHFM and the old LG73 in Vancouver, would begin hosting the morning show in early 2008. Morgan made her morning show debut at CKCL on February 18, 2008.
On September 26, 2008, CKCL dropped Morgan's morning show, and the station's adult contemporary format, switching to classic hits and re-branding itself as "FM 104.9", thus once again leaving CTVglobemedia's market-leading CHQM-FM as the sole adult contemporary outlet in Vancouver. The last song on "Clear FM" was "I Will Remember You" by Sarah McLachlan (which was also the last song on LG73), while the first song under the new format was "Twist and Shout" by The Beatles. This move prompted Astral Media's CISL to flip from oldies to adult standards on November 10, 2008.
On November 12, 2009, CKCL rebranded itself as "104.9 fun FM"; the call sign changed in late November to CFUN-FM to reflect the updated branding. The heritage CFUN call letters were vacated by CTVglobemedia after AM 1410 (now owned by Bell Media) flipped to sports radio and became CFTE.
CHR era as Sonic and Kiss.
On August 16, 2011, Rogers announced that CFUN-FM would launch a new format at 8:30 a.m. the following morning, and began redirecting listeners to sister adult hits station CKLG-FM. "Radio Insight" reported that Rogers had purchased domain names containing names such as "sonic1049" and "sonic Hits.Now.", implicating the possibility of the branding "Sonic" and either a modern rock format (modelled after Rogers-owned CHDI-FM in Edmonton, which also brands as "Sonic") or contemporary hit radio (CHR). The following morning, at 8:42 a.m., CFUN-FM flipped to CHR as "Sonic", launching with 10,000 songs in a row commercial-free.
On February 23, 2015, CFUN re-branded as "Kiss Radio" with no change in format, unifying itself with the Kiss branding used by other Rogers-owned CHR stations. It then swapped call signs with CKKS-FM in Sechelt, British Columbia, which became CFUN-FM.
In 2019, Rogers filed an application with the CRTC to replace CKKS-FM-2 with a new station on the same frequency, which would operate independently of CKKS. CRTC rules require a consultation on the appropriateness of a new station in the market, which can include a requirement for competing applicants. The application was denied in July 2020, with the CRTC ruling that Rogers "significantly understat[ed] the potential market impact of converting its rebroadcasting transmitter to an originating station". In 2021, Rogers received a renewal for CKKS-FM and its rebroadcasters, with the CRTC rebuffing a proposal to drop traffic reports for the Fraser Valley.
In 2021, CKKS shifted to hot adult contemporary and changed its moniker to "Today's Best Music, The New KiSS Radio".
Return to modern rock.
On June 28, 2022, the station announced it was parting ways with morning hosts Kevin Lim and Sonia Sidhu, who joined CKKS in January 2017, as well as afternoon host Tara Jean Stevens. Station owner Rogers said that further announcements about the station's future would follow shortly. At midnight on June 29, the station dropped its format and began stunting with a 30-hour continuous loop of "Killing in the Name" by Rage Against the Machine. The loop occasionally included staged segments of DJs discussing their intent to keep playing the song, and taking calls from listeners wanting them to stop playing "Killing in the Name", or outright "requesting" the song. During this stunt, other changes in staff were reported, as were rumours that the "Sonic" brand would be returning to Vancouver.
While stunting is common practice during a radio format change, this particular stunt gained attention in international media outlets including "The Guardian" and "Rolling Stone", driven in part by theories put forward on social media that the remaining staff had commandeered the station to protest the layoffs, despite the other changes being reported. Industry observer Sean Ross suggested that despite being the "most traditional of format launch stunts", the outsized attention the relaunch received made it "the greatest radio stunt ever—or at least for this year."
On June 30, 2022, at 6:00 a.m., the station officially flipped to modern rock as "Sonic", with new morning host Angela Valiant introducing the format, then playing "Killing in the Name" one more time. The station competed with Jim Pattison Group's CKPK-FM "The Peak"; while that station flipped to hot AC the following month, it ultimately reversed the flip and returned to modern rock in June 2024.
Kiss Throwbacks.
On June 19, 2025, Rogers abruptly dropped "Sonic" and flipped CKKS-FM to classic hits as "Kiss Throwbacks". The new format focuses on pop hits from the 1990s through to the 2010s, and features former MuchMusic VJ and CHFI-FM/Toronto host Rick Campanelli as its morning host, and former CFBT-FM morning host Jonny Staub on afternoon drive.

Yom Huledet

"Yom Huledet (Happy Birthday)" (; meaning "Birthday") was the entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999, performed in Hebrew and English by Eden. The song was written by Yitzhak Baranes, , Jacky Oved, and , and composed by Baranes, Lamai, Oved, and Moshe Datz; Datz previously produced the , as well as represented Israel in Eurovision in as part of Duo Datz with "Kan".
Composition.
The song is a lively and fast-paced tune, showcasing the Contest's growing emphasis on dance-friendly music. In the song, the band sings about the simple happiness of having a birthday and enjoying it with a party. The song's sound is somewhat reminiscent of American music, influenced by two of the singers, Eddie and Gabriel Butler, who are Black Israelites. Notably, their inclusion marked the first instance of black participants representing Israel at Eurovision.
According to Ya'akov Lamai, the song started out as a lower tempo song entirely in English. The song was then rearranged by its four composers, together with producer , into an up-tempo number with a mix of mostly Hebrew lyrics with some English lyrics sprinkled in the chorus and throughout.
At the Eurovision Song Contest.
The song was performed nineteenth on the night, following 's Bobbie Singer with "Reflection" and preceding 's Times Three with "Believe 'n Peace". At the close of voting, it had received 93 points, placing 5th in a field of 23.
It was succeeded as Israeli representative at the 2000 contest by PingPong with "Sameyakh".
Reception.
The song, and the album of the same name, did well commercially. Mako's Roie Hacohen named the song as the most iconic Israeli one-hit wonder, citing the fact the song is played in "almost every Israeli birthday party". Aya Hayut of ynet also described the song as "one of the most listened to in every house in Israel" due to its popularity in birthdays.

Saga Petroleum

Saga Petroleum ASA was a Norwegian upstream petroleum company established in 1972 that was acquired by Norsk Hydro in 1999. In October 2007 it was made part of Statoil. The company was the only fully private oil company in Norway. It had partial ownership of 60 oil field licenses and was operator of 18. Saga had an international profile, including major operations on the British continental shelf as well as minor operations in Angola, Indonesia, Libya and Namibia.
History.
Saga Petroleum was founded in 1972 as a private initiative based on a political wish to have three Norwegian oil companies. The company started up at the same time as Statoil and was part of the three-company model with one state owned company (Statoil), one semi-private company (Norsk Hydro) and one fully private company (Saga). The three Norwegian oil companies were to ensure that petroleum competence was established in Norway.
Among the largest fields Saga operated were the Snorre oil field and the Tordi, Varg and Vigdis oil fields. Not long before the merger Saga had acquired the Kuwait based Santa Fe Exploration for US$1.23 billion.
Hydro purchase.
Originally Elf Aquitaine tried to purchase Saga, but eventually Norsk Hydro acquired it. Saga's financial position had become weak due to the low oil price and the badly timed acquisition of Santa Fe, and oil hedging. After the merger with Hydro some operating responsibilities were transferred to Statoil and all British operations were sold.

Breakfast at Tiffany's (song)

"Breakfast at Tiffany's" is a song by American alternative rock band Deep Blue Something. Originally appearing on their 1993 album "11th Song", it was later re-recorded and released on their 1995 album "Home". Released as a single in July 1995 by Interscope and Rainmaker, the song was the band's only hit in the United States, peaking at number five on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 in January 1996. Outside the United States, "Breakfast at Tiffany's" topped the UK Singles Chart and peaked within the top ten on the charts of Australia, Flanders, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, and Sweden.
Todd Pipes said in a "Q" magazine article about the promotion of "Breakfast at Tiffany's", "As the song had 'breakfast' in the title, radio stations thought it would be genius to have us on at breakfast time. We'd be up 'til 3 am and they'd wonder why we were pissed off playing at 6 am." Follow-up singles failed to match the success of "Breakfast at Tiffany's", hence the reason for the band's classification as a one-hit wonder.
Inspiration and composition.
"Breakfast at Tiffany's" is sung from the point of view of a man whose girlfriend is on the verge of breaking up with him because the two have nothing in common. Desperate to find something, the man brings up the Audrey Hepburn film "Breakfast at Tiffany's", and his girlfriend recalls that they "both kinda liked it." He argues that this should serve as enough motivation for them to work out their problems based on the notion that love will always find a way to make things work.
The film "Roman Holiday" inspired the lyrics of the song, but songwriter Todd Pipes thought that one of Hepburn's other films would make a better song title.
Critical reception.
Brian Wahlert called "Breakfast at Tiffany's" "a cute, catchy song that should fit in well on adult contemporary, Top-40 and alternative radio" with memorable melody that makes it "a perfect single, along with the mildly repetitive, conversational lyrics of the chorus and the bright, acoustic guitar". However, Tom Sinclair of "Entertainment Weekly" was unimpressed. He called it "possibly the year's most innocuous single, 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is distressingly prosaic pop from a wimpy-sounding Texas quartet"; he added that it lacked any "musical piquancy". The "Houston Press" listed the song as the second worst by an artist from Texas, after Vanilla Ice's "Ice Ice Baby". Kevin Courtney from "Irish Times" said, "Deep Blue Something are responsible for the tawdry "Breakfast in Tiffany's" single, and their album is home to much of the same style of overblown, rainswept sentiment." British magazine "Music Week" gave the song top score with five out of five, naming it Single of the Week, writing, "Radio-friendly rock at its best from the Texan trio [sic]. A mighty, bright chorus, quirky lyrics and some great guitar work should enable it to come close in the UK to matching its Top Five placing Stateside." VH1 and "Blender" ranked the song number six on their list of the "50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever".
Music video.
The accompanying music video for "Breakfast at Tiffany's" features the band members arriving to a breakfast table and being served by butlers, beside the curb in front of Tiffany &amp; Co. in Midtown Manhattan. At the end of the video a young woman dressed in a similar style to Holly Golightly's (Audrey Hepburn) from the beginning of the film, except dressed in white rather than black, walks past on the sidewalk, and takes off her sunglasses. The band is also seen performing the song in a field, and on the bed of a flatbed truck in NYC.

Merhotepre Ini

Merhotepre Ini was a minor king in Ancient Egypt, thought to be the successor of Merneferre Ay in the late Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt. The Turin King List may assigned him a brief reign of 2 Years, 3 or 4 Months and 9 days.
Attestations.
Attestations are few and must be separated into "Merhotepre", "Merhotepre Ini" and "Merhotepre Sobekhotep". Franke and von Beckerath identified Merhotepre Sobekhotep with Merhotepre Ini, on the basis that they have the same prenomen. Ryholt (1997) argued they were two separate rulers as Merhotepre Sobekhotep was listed in a lacuna below Sobekhotep IV. Merneferre Ay, the predecessor of Merhotepre Ini, seem to be more related to the Memphis-Faiyum region, while Merhotepre Sobekhotep is more active in the Thebaid region.
"Ini".
Two attestations of "Ini" are known.
Non-contemporary attestations.
The Karnak King List 50 (52) dating to the time of Thutmose III, mentions "Merhotepre" between Sewahenra (49) and Wegaf (51).
The Turin King List 8:04 dating to the time of Ramesses II, mentions "The Dual King Merhotepra, 2 years, 2-4 months, 9 days". In this king list he was preceded by Merneferre Ay (8:03) and succeeded by Sankhenra Sewadjtu (8:05).
Cairo Juridical Stele.
The "Juridical Stela" mentions a king "Merhotepre". It has historically been linked to Merhotepre Ini, but may also refer to Merhotepre Sobekhotep. The Theban document is dated to Year 1 king Nebiryraw I, contains a genealogical charter which states that Ayameru—the son by Vizier Aya and the King's daughter Reditenes—was appointed Governor of El-Kab in Year 1 of Merhotepre. The reason for this appointment was due to the unexpected death of the childless Governor of El-Kab "Aya-junior" who was Vizier Aya's eldest son and Ayameru's elder brother. The charter identifies a certain Kebsi as the son of Governor, and later, Vizier Ayameru. The Cairo Juridical Stela records the sale of the office of the governorship of El-Kab to a certain Sobeknakht. This Sobeknakht I was the father of the illustrious governor Sobeknakht II who built one of the most richly decorated tombs at El-Kab during the Second Intermediate Period.
Theories.
The exact chronological position of Merhotepre Ini in the 13th Dynasty is not known for certain owing to uncertainties affecting earlier kings of the dynasty. He is ranked as the thirty-third king of the dynasty by Darrell Baker, as the thirty-fourth king by Kim Ryholt and in position 28a in studies by Jürgen von Beckerath, a result which Baker qualifies as "nebulous".
Based on the Juridical Stele, Kim Ryholt proposes that Merhotepre Ini was the son of his predecessor Merneferre Ay with his senior queen Ini and with Reditenes as a sister of Merhotepre Ini. The vizierate was an hereditary position at the time and a change of family in charge of the position would have been an important political move. In particular, Reditenes being possibly a sister of Merhotepre Ini, his appointing Aya (thus his brother-in-law) to the vizierate would bring the position into his own family.
For "Ini" see also Mershepsesre Ini.

TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.

TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438 (1976), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States articulated the requirement of materiality in securities fraud cases.
Facts and procedural history.
National Industries, Inc. sought to acquire TSC Industries, Inc., and had purchased 34% of TSC's voting stock from the corporation’s founder. Five nominees from National were placed on TSC's board of directors. TSC's board voted on October 16, 1969 (with National's members abstaining) to liquidate and sell the assets of TSC to National. One aspect of the proposed merger was to exchange both common and preferred in TSC for that of National. TSC and National then issued a joint proxy statement to their shareholders to approve the merger. The shareholders approved and the plan was carried out.
Plaintiff Northway, Inc. was a TSC shareholder who brought suit against both TSC and National, alleging that the proxy statement was incomplete and materially misleading and therefore violated §14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, , and Rules 14a-3 and 14a-9 promulgated thereunder by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Northway asserted that the proxy statement was misleading because National had omitted facts concerning the degree of control it had over TSC, and misrepresented whether or not the merger was a good deal for TSC shareholders. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois denied Northway's motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed with the District Court that there existed a genuine issue of fact as to whether National's acquisition of the Schmidt interests in TSC had resulted in a change of control, and that summary judgment was therefore inappropriate on the Rule 14a-3 claim. But the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's denial of summary judgment to Northway on its Rule 14a-9 claims, holding that certain omissions of fact were material as a matter of law. 512 F.2d 324 (1975). The U.S. Supreme Court then granted certiorari.
Decision.
Justice Marshall, writing for the majority, first examined the underlying policy behind the §14a of the Securities Exchange Act. Stockholders need to understand the questions they are voting on, and misstatements or omissions in proxy materials prevent them from properly doing so. The court had previously held that a defect in a proxy statement need not be decisive in the actual vote: so long as the misstatement or omission was material, there was a causal link between violation of the law and the injury to the shareholder.
Previous standards of materiality.
Marshall then examined the various standards of materiality which had been used by lower courts. The Seventh Circuit used the test of “all facts which a reasonable shareholder "might" consider important”, which Marshall held was not a stringent enough test. The Second and Fifth circuits used a more conventional tort-based test: whether a reasonable person would attach importance to the fact which was misrepresented or omitted in determining his course of action.
Marshall's new formulation of materiality.
Marshall wanted the test for materiality of a misstatement or omission to serve the remedial purposes of §14a, without creating too much liability for companies by allowing any minor or trivial defect to create liability. If the test was too stringent, it would cause the dismissal of otherwise meritorious lawsuits; if it were too lenient, corporate officers would be inclined to overwhelm shareholders with such a large volume of information that truly valuable facts might escape them. He formulated the test as follows: an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote. In other words, the court must determine whether under all the circumstances, the omitted fact would have assumed actual significance in the decision of the shareholder. Thus, materiality is a mixed question of fact and law.
Application of the new rule to the facts of the case.
The two facts that National omitted with respect to the proxy solicitation were the fact that National's chief executive officer was chairman of TSC's board of directors, and that National had previously indicated to the SEC that it was the parent company of TSC. Marshall held that these omissions were of questionable materiality and inappropriate for summary judgment because other disclosures within the proxy materials could have led shareholders to similar conclusions about the degree of control National exercised over TSC. Furthermore, there was already a genuine issue of fact as to whether National was really in control of TSC at the time of the proxy solicitation anyway.
The two facts which National omitted with respect to the fairness of the transaction were the statements of an investment banking firm involved in the deal and the purchase of National's stock by a mutual fund. The investment bank rendered an opinion that the high redemption price of National's stock was a substantial premium over the current market value of TSC's shares. The bank later revised its opinion when it discovered that the warrants for National stock were being offered at a lower price than expected. But since the bank still felt the transaction was fair and that TSC shareholders were still receiving a premium, Marshall held this omission to be immaterial.
Northway also accused National of collusion to manipulate market prices by engaging in a series of transactions with Madison Fund, Inc., a mutual fund. One of National's directors also had a seat on Madison's board, and in the period prior to National's acquisition of TSC, Madison's purchases of National's common stock accounted for 8.5% of all reported transactions for the company's securities. But Northway failed to demonstrate evidence of any unlawful manipulation at trial, and Marshall found that National had no duty to disclose all information which might suggest market manipulation, but rather only to be honest in its disclosures. Marshall overturned the decision of the Court of Appeals and remanded the case.

Canadian Football League in the United States

The Canadian Football League (CFL), which features teams based in Canada, has made efforts to gain further audience in the United States, most directly through expansion into the country from the 1993 CFL season through the 1995 CFL season. The CFL plays Canadian football, a form of gridiron football somewhat different from the more common American football played in the United States and other parts of the world.
The first American team, the Sacramento Gold Miners, joined in 1993. The league added three more American teams in 1994, after which two more teams joined, one relocated, and one folded to bring the total to five in 1995. In 1995, the teams were aligned into a new South Division. The three years saw numerous ownership debacles on both sides of the U.S.–Canada border. The Baltimore Stallions became the only American-based team to win the Grey Cup championship, in 1995.
With the exception of Baltimore, the American teams consistently lost money. Tension also arose between the American and Canadian contingents over rule changes, scheduling, import rules, and marketing. Facing these difficulties, the league returned to being exclusively Canadian beginning with the 1996 season.
Although expansion was the most notable CFL effort in the United States, the league had also made previous inroads. Eleven neutral-site CFL games (including exhibition games) have been held in the United States. In earlier decades, when the CFL season started much later than it does today (i.e., around the same time as that of the National Football League), NFL teams were occasionally invited northward for exhibition interleague play.
The CFL has also attempted to find a television audience in the United States, with one notable venture coinciding with the NFL players' strike in 1982, and more recently on ESPN. Although the CFL's presence on U.S. television has consistently been limited to cable TV networks and streaming services, its U.S. TV audience was enough to account for about 20% of the league's total North American viewership during the 2018 season.
Pre-expansion era.
Until 1993, the Canadian Football League, and its predecessor associations, had always operated solely within Canada, despite most other professional sports leagues in North America being cross-border enterprises. The substantially different rules and fields of the Canadian and American games and the popularity of the National Football League and NCAA Division I-A football in the United States were generally seen to inhibit the chances of any sort of expansion into the United States. Lackluster CFL television ratings in the United States during the 1982 NFL strike seemed to bolster this argument. A proposal by Bill Tatham to have his Arizona Outlaws and possibly other teams of the moribund United States Football League enter the CFL after the league suspended operations saw little interest in both leagues.
Interleague games.
There had been an ongoing degree of cross-fertilization between Canadian and American leagues for several decades prior to the merger of the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union and the Western Interprovincial Football Union to form the CFL in 1958. Until well into the second half of the twentieth century, football in both countries was often played in facilities designed for baseball, the most popular summer sport in both countries, with both Major League Baseball (whose facilities hosted several NFL teams) and minor league baseball attracting large crowds in both countries. As a result, much like their American counterparts, the Canadian leagues played mainly in the autumn after the baseball season had wound down.
Until the early 1960s, such arrangements allowed for a number of CFL–NFL interleague games to be held in Canada. NFL teams handily won most of these contests, however the most compelling reason they were discontinued was that minor league baseball attendance in both countries fell drastically in the 1950s and 1960s, a development which coincided with MLB telecasts reaching an ever-larger audience. This allowed CFL teams to take over several facilities originally designed to accommodate baseball for their exclusive use, and in turn allowed the CFL to play a less compressed schedule that eventually started in early summer. The NFL, by contrast, had neither the need nor the inclination to play throughout the summer in the much warmer U.S. climate, and thus continued to start its schedule in early September, thus making interleague play with the CFL unfeasible.
Neutral site games.
Eleven neutral-site IRFU/WIFU/CFL games have been played on American soil. The earliest of these dates to 1909, while the bulk occurred between 1951 and 1967. The 1909 game, featuring the Ottawa Rough Riders and Hamilton Tigers of the IRFU, was sponsored by the "New York Herald" and played at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx; this in the era when the Canadian game was more similar to rugby football and did not feature modern rules such as the forward pass like the American game.
The next game, a 1951 match-up between the IRFU's Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Toronto Argonauts in Buffalo, was billed as the first true all-Canadian game played in the United States. Played in a city that at the time was embittered with the National Football League after its All-America Football Conference team was controversially excluded from a merger with the NFL, the Buffalo game drew more than 18,000 fans – a decent crowd for the era. In 1958, the first season officially played under the CFL moniker, Hamilton defeated Ottawa in a regular-season contest in front of about 15,000 in Philadelphia's cavernous Municipal Stadium, 24–18. It remains the only CFL game played outside Canada, involving two Canadian teams, that actually counted in the standings.
Prior to and even after the formation of the CFL, the teams of the IRFU (which eventually became the CFL's Eastern Football Conference) were regarded, especially in Eastern Canada, as superior to the Western Canadian teams. Starting in the 1930s, Western Canadian teams had begun aggressively scouting for and recruiting players from the rich American talent pool, largely in an effort to achieve parity with the East. The American Pacific Northwest became a frequent site for WIFU and later CFL preseason games in the 1950s and 1960s with Western Canadian teams, particularly the BC Lions, being called upon to entertain their regional neighbours. News reports from the time suggest a hybrid game of three down Canadian ball played on the more restricted 100 yard American field. One BC–Winnipeg matchup in 1960 was held not on the west coast but in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, presumably because both teams had a number of former University of Iowa stars, including Willie Mitchell, who scored the Lions' only touchdown in a 13–7 loss in front of 12,583. Western teams were mostly ignored by U.S. clubs as potential opposition for preseason interleague contests, although this was in part due to the more onerous travel requirements to Western Canada in an era when rail travel was the norm and the fact the WIFU moved up the start of its regular season long before the Eastern section followed suit. It would not be until 2019 that NFL teams would play any sort of contest in Western Canada.
Most exhibition games involving Canadian teams in the U.S. tended to be characterized by low scores and frequent punting, with crowds between 10,000 and 20,000; these numbers dropped off in the last two games of the era. A low-scoring BC–Edmonton game in Everett, Washington, in 1967 drew just over 6,000; there would not be another CFL game in the United States until the cusp of US expansion itself in 1992.
Television.
The idea of attracting American fans through television has long been a goal of the CFL although the results have been intermittent. As early as 1954, the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (forerunner of the CFL's East Division) struck a deal with NBC that lasted a year and featured 13 games. The infamous Fog Bowl of 1962 was—at least until play was suspended—broadcast by ABC. Over subsequent years various non-major networks picked up an assortment of games.
The fledgling ESPN cable network signed a deal in 1980 to broadcast 30 CFL regular season games and the playoffs (including the Grey Cup game) in the United States, and CFL games became a fixture of the early years of the network. Two years later, in 1982, after NFL players went on strike in September, the CFL got another chance at major network exposure when NBC bought out the ESPN rights for $100,000 a game to make up for its lost football programming. NBC would air CFL games on Sunday afternoons with full NFL production values and announcing crews. However, every one of the four games shown was a blowout, and the league and network decided to black out the games on the NBC stations closest to the Canadian border, and ratings were a major disappointment. NBC quickly backed out of the arrangement.
Expansion.
Background.
The idea of expansion into the United States began to take shape in the early 1990s, prompted by precarious ownership situations and chronic money shortages among the existing Canadian teams. The chief catalyst of the league's struggles was Carling O'Keefe's decision to stop its lucrative television sponsorship in 1987. The arrangement had provided steady income to all of the league's teams, reaching $11 million per season before its withdrawal. However, these guaranteed revenues, instead of being used to grow the league, had subsidized outdated and shoddy financial practices and marketing both at the team and league level. Longtime CFL commissioner Jake Gaudaur, who had negotiated the league's sponsorship deals with Carling, had retired in 1984. The Montreal Alouettes, already having been rescued from failure five years prior, folded during the 1987 preseason. It would take two decades for economic equilibrium to again be reestablished. Concurrently with Carling O'Keefe's withdrawal, CTV Television Network, its television partner for the previous 26 seasons, cancelled its CFL broadcasts prior to the 1987 season, forcing the league to take over syndication of the package itself and divert much of the remaining rights fees it was collecting from its other television partners to subsidize the Canadian Football Network. 
With the exception of the Edmonton Eskimos, every team in the league had faced some kind of crisis in the years leading up to 1993. In addition to Montreal's sudden collapse, the Calgary Stampeders and publicly owned Saskatchewan Roughriders had to mount public campaigns to survive. By 1993, the BC Lions had experienced years of ownership chaos and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers faced $3 million in debt, despite frugal management. The Toronto Argonauts were embroiled in a series of ownership crises after the initially successful ownership triumvirate of Bruce McNall, Wayne Gretzky, and John Candy faced mounting financial losses. The Hamilton Tiger-Cats were confronting an attendance swoon, fan malaise, and struggling community ownership. Both Southern Ontario teams faced competition at the gate and for general attention from the NFL's Buffalo Bills, then in the middle of their run of four consecutive Super Bowl appearances. Finally, the Ottawa Rough Riders and their fans were being treated to disappointing squads on the field and constant drama off the field from the team's under-capitalized and mercurial owner, Bernie Glieberman.
Against this economic backdrop, a new generation of venture capitalist owners took the place of the community groups, local consortiums, or philanthropists that typically had owned the teams and operated them without any serious profit motive. They were led by McNall in Toronto, Glieberman in Ottawa, and Larry Ryckman in Calgary. Larry Smith was hired as league commissioner in February 1992, reportedly on the explicit understanding that he would pursue American expansion. While Smith would become the most visible face of the era, he emphasized that it was the owners who drove the initiative, particularly McNall and Ryckman. McNall's issues with cash flow, later revealed to be the result of his wealth being inflated by illegal accounting, were one obvious instigator. While the newer owners championed expansion, equal distribution of the expansion fees also appealed to the community owned teams as these would shore up their finances.
1992–1993.
With the green light from the owners, Smith began the task of expanding the league across the border, beginning with a June 1992 exhibition game between the Argonauts and Stampeders in Portland, Oregon. A total of 15,362 attended, close to the averages later American teams would post. Portland was seriously considered for a franchise, but investors failed to emerge. The expansion announcement prompted numerous applications from a wide variety of American cities. By the end of the expansion era, a minimum of 22 cities were reported to have been considered for teams.
Coincidentally, the World League of American Football, an attempt by the NFL to create a spring league in major markets without NFL teams (including Montreal), suspended its North American operations after its 1992 season. WLAF owners Fred Anderson of the Sacramento Surge and Larry J. Benson of the San Antonio Riders applied to join the CFL as the Sacramento Gold Miners and San Antonio Texans, respectively. On January 13, 1993, the league approved both franchises by a vote of 7–1, with Winnipeg dissenting. League owners also decided not to apply the requirement of 20 "non-import" Canadian-raised players to the American squads after being advised that such a requirement would be a violation of US employment laws.
The experiment started on a sour note, however, when an ownership dispute forced Benson to pull San Antonio out on the same evening the franchise was to be formally introduced. Anderson decided to continue with the venture after Benson's withdrawal, but made clear that he did not want his team to be the only American franchise after 1993. The Gold Miners were placed in the very strong West Division and finished last with a record of 6–12. The Gold Miners played at the austere Hornet Stadium, located on the campus of Sacramento State University and averaged around 17,000 fans per game (down slightly from the roughly 21,000 fans per game the Surge had drawn in 1992), selling 9,000 season tickets.
In response to a disparity between the East and West Divisions, it was decided in the middle of the season to grant the fourth-place Western team a playoff berth. There was speculation this was done in part to ensure Sacramento remained in playoff contention as long as possible and at the insistence of Ryckman, who preferred the revenue of two playoff games for his first-place Stampeders over a first-round bye.
1994.
In 1994 the Gold Miners were joined by three other American teams: the Las Vegas Posse, Baltimore CFL Colts, and Shreveport Pirates. On television ESPN and its subsidiary ESPN2 picked up some games alongside the usual broadcasting by TSN and CBC in Canada. Shreveport and Baltimore were placed in the East Division, while Sacramento and Las Vegas were placed in the West. The playoffs were expanded again to eight teams (four per division). Another franchise was to have been added in Orlando; however, in a debacle that had now become a pattern, the presumptive ownership group failed to appear at the January 1994 press conference announcing the team's formation.
The Baltimore CFL Colts made headlines before even playing a down. Owned by Jim Speros, the team was marketed as a revival of the Baltimore Colts NFL franchise, who had left the city 10 years earlier and had also played at Memorial Stadium. The team's embrace of the Colts' history gained them an instant following in Baltimore and publicity in the national sports media, although an injunction obtained shortly before the team's first game forced the team to stop using "Colts" in their name and to instead refer to the team as the "Baltimore CFLers" or "Baltimore Football Club". Since Memorial Stadium had originally been built to accommodate Major League Baseball's Baltimore Orioles as well as football, its playing surface was large enough to accommodate a full-size Canadian field.
Baltimore was far and away the most successful of any American CFL team both on the field and off, averaging crowds of over 37,000 their first year. Knowing that Canadian football was considerably different from the American game, Speros stocked the Baltimore club mostly with CFL veterans. As coach, he brought in Don Matthews, who had already played in two Grey Cups and won one. The result was a team that eventually finished second in the East with a 12–6 record and became the first American team to qualify for the playoffs, advancing all the way to the Grey Cup game. In a thrilling match played in BC Place, the BC Lions defeated Baltimore on a last-second field goal by Lui Passaglia. Perhaps most remarkably, they were reported to have turned a profit in their first year after an initial US$7 million investment by Speros.
The Shreveport Pirates were actually a transplantation of Bernie Glieberman and his organization from Ottawa. The Gliebermans had hinted at moving the Rough Riders to the United States, making them even more unpopular than they already were in Canada's capital. As part of a settlement with the CFL, Glieberman sold the Rough Riders to Bruce Firestone for , and in return was granted a US-based expansion team which became the Shreveport Pirates. As part of the deal, Glieberman not only had to pay the expansion fee, but also had to settle his previous Ottawa debts. There was a groundswell of local support for the club, but also significant difficulties in its first year, including stifling weather, cultural clashes, organizational gaffes, and serious hints of under-capitalization (during training camp the team was housed in a dorm above a milking barn). A woeful record did not help, as the team lost its first 14 games. The Pirates showed some promise at the end of the season, reeling off a 3–1 record in their final four games; attendance also jumped, and the home finale drew over 32,000 fans to 40,000-seat Independence Stadium, the highest for any U.S.-hosted CFL game outside Baltimore.
The Gold Miners, after spending much of 1993 adjusting to the Canadian game, rebounded strongly to finish 9–8–1 in their second season, three points short of the playoffs. They were led again by David Archer at quarterback, who had persisted with the team since its World League days as the Sacramento Surge. However, in what was to become a trend during the CFL expansion, the second Sacramento season saw an attendance decline.
At the other end of the spectrum, the Posse were an abject failure both on the field and off. Playing in Sam Boyd Stadium on the outskirts of the city and practicing on an ersatz practice field in the parking lot of the Riviera Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip, the team became infamous for botched gimmicks. Attendance, never good to begin with, dropped to embarrassing levels as the season went on. With such dreadful gates, the team's cash flow dwindled to the point that, according to one assistant coach, "we couldn't even afford paper." After only 2,350 attended an October home game against Winnipeg (the lowest-attended match since the CFL's founding in 1958), owner Nick Mileti announced the team was suspending operations. To avoid shuttering a team mid-season, the league moved the Posse's final home game to Edmonton. The team was little better on the field, finishing 5–13—the second-worst record in the league (ahead of only the Pirates).
1994–1995 offseason.
The Las Vegas situation was one of a bevy of developments faced by the league in the 1994–1995 offseason. The Posse were officially disbanded in April 1995, but not before the CFL damaged its credibility by twice granting provisional approval for the franchise's relocation, first to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, then to Jackson, Mississippi. The Milwaukee bid was to be owned by Marvin Fishman and use Milwaukee County Stadium, which for the previous four decades had hosted Green Bay Packers home games in Milwaukee before the Packers decided to move their entire home schedule to Lambeau Field beginning in 1995; while County Stadium's main tenants, the Milwaukee Brewers, accepted the Packers, the idea of sharing the venue with a CFL team whose schedule substantially overlapped with Major League Baseball led them to reject the relocation. The Mississippi team was even included on the 1995 internal schedule and had hired a general manager and coaching staff, only for the deal to collapse amid squabbles with the Las Vegas corporation that owned the Posse. A group from Miami, Florida, tried to convince the league to let it buy the remains of the Posse and move them to South Florida as the Miami Manatees, to play in the Miami Orange Bowl. An exhibition game between Birmingham and Baltimore was held there in June 1995 to gauge support, which drew a decent crowd just above 20,000.
The Gold Miners grew increasingly dissatisfied with Hornet Stadium, and Anderson blamed losses of US$10 million over two years on the facility. After attempts to have Sacramento State upgrade or replace the facility failed, he announced in October 1994—with two weeks to go in the season—that the Gold Miners would be playing elsewhere in 1995. Anderson initially intended to move to Oakland, but quickly abandoned those plans after it became apparent that Los Angeles Raiders owner Al Davis was seriously considering moving his NFL franchise back to its original city (the move came to pass). The Gold Miners eventually moved to the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, where they played as the San Antonio Texans.
With the Posse folding, the Gold Miners moving, and the Pirates facing money troubles, three of the four CFL expansion teams had stumbled. The league, however, still managed to expand into two new markets for the 1995 season. The Memphis Mad Dogs were announced in November 1994, followed by the Birmingham Barracudas in January 1995. The Memphis deal was hailed as a large step forward for the league's presence in the U.S., as it brought in the wealth of team owner Fred Smith (the founder and CEO of Federal Express) and his marketing connections.
1995.
With these changes, the CFL abandoned its longstanding east–west divisional format in favour of a north–south format for 1995. The five American teams—Baltimore, Birmingham, Memphis, San Antonio, and Shreveport—would be placed in the South Division, while the eight Canadian teams were included in the North Division. The top five Canadian teams and top three American teams would qualify for the playoffs; the fifth-seeded North team would "cross over" to the South playoffs, for a total of four teams per playoff bracket. The league gained its first national American television contract with ESPN2, which agreed to televise more than 20 regular season games, plus the playoffs. The deal was reportedly worth about $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The CFL would remain on the network until 1997.
The Birmingham Barracudas, owned by insurance tycoon Art Williams, entered the league playing at Legion Field, which could accommodate a Canadian football field with 15-yard end zones (five yards shorter than the standard 20 yards). Led by future Hall of Famer Matt Dunigan at quarterback, the Barracudas fell short of the South Division title, but remained competitive throughout the year. Despite selling only 2,000 season tickets and facing community apathy after numerous attempts at pro football squads had failed in the city, attendance for the first three games exceeded expectations. Williams knew that the 'Cudas potentially faced serious attendance problems once the traditional American football season began, and persuaded the CFL to let them play their late-season home games on Sunday afternoons – something the league had avoided in order to avoid putting its television broadcasts in direct competition with the NFL's. Williams calculated that competing with the NFL on television was a more reasonable risk to take compared to competition with local high school and Alabama/Auburn college football. Despite the time change, attendance still dropped to unsustainable levels; none of the final four home games attracted more than 10,000 people. Williams claimed to have lost at least US$10 million on the season—at least as much as his startup costs—and blamed fan apathy for the attendance woes.
Memphis had been a prime target for either expansion or relocation, as it was near Shreveport and San Antonio. In 1995, Fred Smith's ownership group, which had narrowly missed out on an NFL team, was awarded a CFL franchise to begin play as the Memphis Mad Dogs. The Mad Dogs played in the Liberty Bowl, which had to be heavily reconfigured to accommodate the Canadian game. Astroturf sections were added around the grass field to accommodate the required width, while the expansion of the length of the field to 110 yards forced the end zones to become half Astroturf pentagons that averaged seven yards in the corners and fourteen yards behind the uprights. The grandstands stood mere yards from the end line, prompting veteran CFL quarterback Danny McManus to call the end zones "a lawsuit waiting to happen."
Like Williams, Smith knew the Mad Dogs would face an uphill battle attracting fans once the traditional American football season started. As was the case in Birmingham, Smith persuaded the CFL to let the Dogs play their late-season home games on Sundays to avoid competing against high school and Tennessee/Ole Miss football. It was of no avail; late in the season the Mad Dogs struggled to attract more than 10,000 people. Like Williams, Smith publicly blamed community apathy and media hostility for the lackluster attendance. The team went 9–9 in their only year.
In Shreveport, meanwhile, whatever positive momentum the Pirates had gained at the end of the 1994 season failed to carry over into 1995. Despite the signing of former NFL quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver, who put up decent numbers, the squad limped to a 5–13 record. As elsewhere, Shreveport saw a second season attendance decline, and with the season winding down, the city had clearly soured on the Gliebermans. They became embroiled in legal difficulties and, in one particularly absurd incident, Bernie Glieberman had his lawyer attempt (unsuccessfully) to abscond with a half-million dollar Tucker automobile that Glieberman had donated to a local museum.
Freshly relocated from Sacramento, the San Antonio Texans finally found success on the field in 1995 playing in the brand new Alamodome. The Alamodome offered two advantages over other U.S. facilities – it was a multi-purpose facility with retractable seating that could accommodate a full size CFL field, and it was an indoor, air-conditioned facility, meaning the teams playing there did not have to deal with the summer heat. The team continued to be bankrolled by the enthusiastic Fred Anderson. Archer, entering his fifth year as Anderson's quarterback, led the second best offence in the league; he nevertheless suffered an injury late in the season, prompting the team to hire 45-year-old Joe Ferguson (whom Stephenson had coached as a member of the Buffalo Bills) out of retirement to serve as a backup. They finished 12–6 and finally made the playoffs. In the first round they trounced Birmingham, 51–9, before falling to the Baltimore Stallions, 21–11, in the South Division final. Team attendance was around the same level Anderson had previously seen in Sacramento.
The Baltimore franchise finally received a permanent name, the "Baltimore Stallions." Led by quarterback Tracy Ham and running back Mike Pringle, the Stallions started 2–3, but then steamrolled through the rest of the season, winning 13 games in a row to finish first in the South Division. They knocked off Winnipeg and then San Antonio in the South Division final. They faced the Calgary Stampeders in the 1995 Grey Cup in Regina, Saskatchewan and won convincingly, 37–20. The first and only American team to take the championship, the 1995 Stallions team has since acquired a reputation as one of the CFL's best ever. At the time, their .756 winning percentage over their first two seasons was the best start for an expansion team in North American professional sports history.
While the Stallions experienced a successful year on the field, and finished second to Edmonton in average attendance, the city's excitement of 1994 died down. Attendance declined, with season ticket sales dropping to around 17,000. Later reports suggested that attendance numbers had been inflated by giveaways and the team projected some losses in 1995. Despite these difficulties, the Stallions remained the model that lent the American expansion project credibility; other American owners looked to Baltimore in deciding on the future of their own teams.
End of U.S. experiment.
League troubles.
Despite some positive initial attendance numbers, after three years it was clear that general American fan interest in Canadian football was sparse. Differences in the Canadian game, such as three downs and the larger field, had not been embraced south of the border. While the CFL had a small deal with ESPN2, a major television contract had not materialized; efforts by the league's U.S. teams to negotiate a deal with CBS Sports failed after the network managed to pick up college football rights for 1996. There was no widespread national promotional effort for the league in the U.S., and the general preference to avoid competing with the NFL in major markets hurt its efforts to reach out to major media platforms. Moreover, the July to November CFL season, designed to ensure the playoffs finish before Canada's harsh winters set in, forced most American teams to play the first half of the season in oppressive heat and the second half in competition with high school football, college football, and the NFL.
Tension had also arisen between the American and Canadian teams. As early as the 1994 Grey Cup, the American owners, led by Speros in Baltimore, were calling for numerous changes to accommodate the American teams and their potential fans. They proposed that the end zones be reduced to 15 yards in length, that the Grey Cup be played earlier in the year, that player quotas be removed for all teams, and that a league name change be considered. By 1995, Mad Dogs coach Pepper Rodgers was openly disparaging Canadian rules and teams. Officials of the new American teams found that the Canadian clubs were hesitant to accommodate the new American audience. The Canadian owners, for their part, refused to make any major changes to the rules, the schedule, or the name of the league; the only concession they made was to allow smaller field sizes in American stadiums that could not fit a regulation CFL field.
Agreement on rules and schedules might have been reached had the league achieved economic stability, but losses among American teams were drastic and widespread. In 1995 alone, Fred Anderson estimated that the U.S. teams had collectively lost more than US$20 million. "The Baltimore Sun" provides a similar estimate of US$21 million. The $10 million estimated loss in Birmingham was the most substantial, followed by US$4 to $6 million estimated for Anderson's Texans. Memphis and Shreveport losses were estimated at US$3 million apiece. The Baltimore losses were comparatively modest at US$1 to $1.5 million, but stung the league, given the prestige of the franchise.
Canadian teams were facing their own troubles, particularly with attendance. The eight Canadian teams were down to an average of 22,740 in 1994, a drop of 3,000 from the previous year. It marked the beginning of an historic trough in Canadian CFL attendance that would last for most of the 1990s. A massive league-wide season ticket drive was undertaken prior to 1995. Commissioner Larry Smith told the Rough Riders and Tiger-Cats that unless they sold more tickets, they would be forced to either fold or move. Ottawa owner Bruce Firestone went bankrupt after the 1994 season, placing the team in the hands of Horn Chen, who turned out to be its final owner. In Calgary, Ryckman suggested he would move the Stampeders to the United States unless fans stepped up with 16,000 season tickets. While season ticket goals were met, the overall increase in attendance was modest in 1995 to 24,406 and would be wiped out the next year. In Toronto, Bruce McNall found it increasingly difficult to justify massive losses from an asset 3,000 miles away from his base in Los Angeles, and put the team up for sale. He ultimately sold the Argos to league television partner TSN in May 1994, a sale delayed by John Candy's death that March. Later that year, McNall's finances imploded in the midst of revelations of financial wrongdoing
End game.
With these troubles still fresh, the NFL then dealt the CFL's American expansion a critical blow. On November 6, 1995—the week of the South Division Final—Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell announced he was moving his NFL franchise to Baltimore for the following season. A day after the game, the Stallions' owners called Commissioner Smith and requested a meeting in Toronto; Smith's summary of their position was "we'll pay our bills but we're done." The Stallions had been broadsided by the announcement, even though rumors of the NFL's impending return to Baltimore had cropped up as early as September. Speros and other insiders initially did not believe Modell was serious, a belief shared for a time even by some NFL owners. Even as it became clear that the Browns' relocation threat was credible, they still hoped NFL owners known to be opposed to the Browns' relocation such as Pittsburgh's Dan Rooney and Buffalo's Ralph Wilson would persuade Modell to come to terms with Cleveland. Nonetheless, by November the rumors were enough to seriously impair the Stallions' marketing efforts, and attendance for the team's semi-final against Winnipeg (played two days before the Browns' announcement) was a franchise low of 21,040.
Once the Browns' move became official, what remained of local support for the Stallions dried up almost overnight. The team responded with desperate measures, essentially giving away thousands of tickets for what would become the final CFL game played in the United States, and announced a respectable attendance of 30,217 for their South Division Final victory over San Antonio. It was to no avail; the Grey Cup victory celebration in Inner Harbor went almost unnoticed in local media.
Speros quickly realized that as successful as the Stallions had been, they could not even begin to compete with an NFL team. While Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke (one of the few dignitaries to attend the Stallions' championship celebration) and some others claimed it was possible that the Stallions could coexist with Modell's team (which was ultimately reconstituted as the Baltimore Ravens following a settlement between Modell, the NFL and the city of Cleveland) it soon became apparent that there wasn't enough advertising revenue or fan support to go around. Additionally, the Stallions would have faced serious logistical problems with Memorial Stadium once the NFL season started in September. Speros said years later that all of this led him to conclude that the Stallions would have effectively been reduced to "minor league" status had they stayed in Baltimore.
Speros began talks with Richmond, Norfolk, the Lehigh Valley, and, most seriously, Houston, which was about to lose the NFL's Oilers. At one point, he was prepared to move to Houston and play in the Astrodome, and also intended to take on then-Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane as a minority partner. Williams had decided to get out even before Baltimore's fate was announced; a day after the Barracudas were eliminated from the playoffs (and a day before the Browns announced they were leaving Cleveland), he announced that the squad would not be playing in Birmingham in 1996, if it returned at all. Earlier, he had stated that he was not willing to play another season in Birmingham unless the league moved to a spring schedule; he felt it would be folly to risk another season going head-to-head with Alabama and Auburn.
The end came swiftly in the months after the Grey Cup. By the time of a December 1 CFL Board of Governors meeting, the Mad Dogs had folded and the Barracudas were on the brink. The Pirates held out a little longer and flirted with a relocation to Norfolk, but local officials broke off talks after they learned that Glieberman was still facing legal disputes in Shreveport. The Barracudas resurfaced in the news in January 1996 when Williams sold them for $750,000 to a group that planned to move them to Shreveport as a replacement for the Pirates. However, that deal was contingent upon the league approving the sale and relocation, which never happened.
Smith had given the American teams until the end of January 1996 to decide whether they would return for the 1996 season. By then, sources were stating that four of the five American teams had "either folded, have no stadiums to play in or will not be permitted to be part of the CFL in 1996." Only the Stallions appeared to be able to take the field in some form for the 1996 season. Of the American owners, Anderson was the most amenable to retaining an American-based team in 1996. While he initially stated that the league needed at least three other American teams for the Texans to be viable, he was willing to bring the Texans back for 1996 if the Stallions moved to Houston, since this would have not only ensured two American teams but also an intrastate rivalry. Anderson estimated that if there was even one other American team in the league, he could withstand annual losses of US$2 million indefinitely. However, that scenario looked less and less likely, as Speros—under prodding from Smith—had begun serious discussions with officials in Montreal.
Against this backdrop, a second round of league meetings was held on February 2, where all five American franchises, including the Stallions, were formally shuttered, bringing the CFL's American expansion to a close. At the same time, former Stallions owner Speros was granted a "reactivated" Alouettes franchise in Montreal. Stallions general manager Jim Popp and much of the Stallions' coaching and front office staff moved north to Montreal and much of the club's roster re-signed with the Alouettes.
Aftermath.
The entire league was once again based only in Canada beginning with the 1996 CFL season, with Smith describing the move as a "retrenchment". This, however, did not stem the troubles the teams were facing. With no expansion fee revenue to buoy them, eight of the nine teams would lose money in 1996. The 84th Grey Cup was nearly canceled before the coffee shop chain Tim Hortons stepped in and provided enough sponsorship money to allow both competing teams to collect their paychecks. The Rough Riders disbanded at the end of the season and the Stampeders declared bankruptcy after Ryckman was fined $250,000 for stock manipulation by the Alberta Securities Commission and barred from doing business in Alberta. After the indictment of McNall, Ryckman was the second major architect of expansion to run afoul of the law; the Stampeders were later bought by Sig Gutsche via a receivership court for $1.6 million on April 3.
Other legal troubles were left over in wake of the expansion collapse. Louisiana courts eventually ordered the Gliebermans to repay Shreveport US$1 million with interest; the dispute centered over whether the city had agreed to share losses or simply lent money to the ownership group. Art Williams, enraged after discovering some American owners had received discounts and extended payment periods on their franchise fees, threatened litigation and at first refused to honour the balance of Matt Dunigan's sizable contract before the matter entered litigation.
The expansion fees themselves were a significant legacy of the expansion effort. Smith claims US$14 to $15 million was brought in and that it saved the league. A more modest assessment suggests expansion saved the Stampeders and Tiger-Cats—both teams were undeniably in distress during the era—and that the other Canadian teams were able to maintain a semblance of stability.
The post-expansion financial crisis would eventually elicit a response from the NFL. By the end of 1996, speculation was rampant that if the NFL placed a franchise in Toronto, it would mean the end of the CFL. Instead, in exchange for a new player agreement between the leagues, the NFL provided the CFL franchises with marketing assistance and a $3 million loan in 1997.
In 1999, World Wrestling Federation chairman Vince McMahon was offered the chance to buy the Argonauts, and countered with a proposal to buy the entire league and "have it migrate south", which the owners refused. McMahon would instead partner with NBC to create the XFL, which would place teams in Birmingham, Las Vegas, and Memphis at the same stadiums as their respective CFL franchises previously played. Following massive losses, NBC and the WWF shuttered the XFL after one year, though it would return nineteen years later—conspicuously absent from any markets where the CFL had resided (subsequent XFL owners would return to Las Vegas and to San Antonio in 2023). Birmingham (the Iron and Stallions) and Memphis (Express and Showboats, the latter of which was brought to Memphis by Mad Dogs owner Fred Smith) both hosted teams in the XFL's contemporary rivals, the Alliance of American Football and revived United States Football League, respectively. Baltimore owner Jim Speros would later briefly re-emerge as the original owner of the Virginia Destroyers of the United Football League but withdrew from the purchase before the team began play.
The CFL re-gained financial stability in the 2000s, mostly thanks to enforcement of a salary cap, stricter standards of ownership, and increasingly lucrative television contracts negotiated with Canadian networks. The league has remained solely focused on its Canadian operations, with expansion efforts focused for decades on returning a stable team to Ottawa. The first attempt at a replacement for the Rough Riders, the Ottawa Renegades, played from 2002 to 2005. A second attempt, the Ottawa RedBlacks launched in 2014 and have so far been a success under the ownership of Jeff Hunt's consortium. Further expansion efforts were limited to one-off games such as Touchdown Atlantic and Northern Kickoff in more distant Canadian markets until the late 2010s when the league commenced negotiations with Schooners Sports and Entertainment to place an expansion team in Atlantic Canada.
The re-establishment of the Montreal Alouettes remains as the major legacy of the American experiment. Commissioner Smith, under pressure from the CFLPA and keen to ensure Montreal's new team was a Grey Cup contender from the outset, persuaded the other eight CFL teams to permit an expansion draft in which the Alouettes were allowed to draft only Canadian players to allow the team to remain competitive under the more restrictive rule regime, finishing their first season 12–6 and advancing to the East Final. Eventually, Speros would sell the Alouettes to Robert Wetenhall, with Smith resigning as commissioner to become President of the team. Wetenhall's patient ownership, and a move to the more intimate Percival Molson Memorial Stadium, returned the team to stability off the field while steering it to three Grey Cups on the field. Longtime Alouettes starting quarterback Anthony Calvillo was the last remaining active player that played for an American CFL team (Las Vegas) upon his retirement after the 2013 season.
Even after the end of U.S. expansion, American investors continued to be involved with the CFL for many years at the ownership level, notably in Calgary and Ottawa. By the end of the first decade of the 21st century, all extant franchises except Montreal had come under Canadian ownership, leaving the Alouettes' Wetenhall as the league's only American owner. Wetenhall sold his franchise back to the league prior to the start of the 2019 season, thus putting the CFL under exclusively Canadian-based ownership for the first time in decades.
Further U.S. expansion has been occasionally proposed informally. However, the league itself has expressed little interest in these proposals and U.S. expansion has not been formally explored. The spectre of American CFL games has mainly been used as a device for satire and April Fool's Day jokes. One potential expansion candidate that attracted media attention is the St. Louis Battlehawks. In addition to the Battlehawks' league, the XFL at the time, having discussed a partnership agreement with the CFL in 2021, TSN writer Dave Naylor suggested in 2024 that St. Louis would be an ideal expansion candidate should the Battlehawks' current league, the United Football League, ever shut down. The Battlehawks outdrew all of the CFL's teams in 2024 in fan attendance.
Post-expansion American media.
For several years after the expansion era contract with ESPN ended in 1997, the CFL was absent from American television. At the end of 2001, the league began a relationship with the now-defunct America One network that would last until 2009. Coverage was relatively generous with 43 games, including the playoffs, covered in the last year. A more modest deal of 14 games was negotiated with the NFL Network in 2010, which lasted two years. The 2012 season began without a contract and the league resorted to internet broadcasts on ESPN3 until NBC Sports Network agreed to a 14-game regular season package of its own; unlike the NFL Network, NBC opted to broadcast games during the NFL preseason as well as cover the playoffs and Grey Cup. Both the NBC and ESPN deals were renewed in 2013 with a slight scaling back of playoff coverage and ESPN2 also picking up a handful of games in the summer months. Since 2013, CFL games have been broadcast exclusively on the ESPN networks in the United States; American broadcasts have been simulcasts of game coverage from TSN, of which current U.S. broadcaster ESPN is a minority shareholder.
In the 2018 CFL season, CFL broadcasts on ESPN attracted an average of 163,000 U.S. viewers per game, which accounted for about one-fifth of the total North American television audience.

Edgar Jones (musician)

Edgar William Jones (born 4 December 1970), also known as Edgar Summertyme, is an English singer-songwriter and musician. Jones was originally the bass player and singer-songwriter for the Stairs and has since formed and fronted the Isrites, The Big Kids, Edgar Jones &amp; the Joneses and Free Peace. He has also played as a session musician for several artists, including Ian McCulloch, Paul Weller, Saint Etienne and Ocean Colour Scene.
Career.
Early career: to 1994.
Jones was born in Liverpool. With Ged Lynn and Paul Maguire, he formed The Stairs, a 1960s-oriented band with English beat, garage rock, blues rock and psychedelic influences. The band's manager, Jason Otty, would often play harmonica, and the band would later feature 2nd guitarists Carl Cook and Daniel Kearney before splitting in 1994. The band achieved cult status with the album "Mexican R'n'B" (1992).
1995–2001: The Isrites and the Big Kids.
Jones also formed The Isrites with Sean Payne, later of the Zutons, Paul Maguire's younger brother Dave and Luke Goldberg, later of Book and the Big Kids again with Sean Payne and Russell Pritchard, later of The Zutons, and Howie Payne of The Stands. Although both bands split before releasing anything, material has since been issued on several compilations by The Viper Label.
2002–2011: Edgar Jones &amp; the Joneses and Free Peace.
Having ditched the Summertyme pseudonym, Edgar released his first solo album as Edgar "Jones" Jones in 2005 entitled "Soothing Music for Stray Cats" which encompassing elements of jazz, R&amp;B, soul and doo wop and was recorded on a portastudio donated by Johnny Marr. Edgar followed the album up with "Gettin' a Little Help from The Joneses," backed by The Joneses, in 2007 and "The Masked Marauder" in 2009.
Jones formed Free Peace in August 2008 with his nephew Nick Miniski and guitarist Stuart Gimblett. An EP was released via gigs, mail orders and independent record shops in Liverpool, and they were recording they debut album, which was set to be released on their label, Loud Soul, in October 2009. The band saw Jones return to the 3-piece rock sound of The Stairs, and they had reportedly finished about 20 songs for their debut album. Despite regularly gigging, including major support slots with Oasis, the band split up with an album entitled "Stormy Weather" released under the name "The Edgar Jones Free Peace Thing" in September 2011 on the Viper label over a year after the band disbanded.
2012–present: Solo work.
Under Edgar Summertyme, Jones released his fourth solo album, "Sense of Harmony," in 2012.
In November 2015, Jones reunited with The Stairs, who later released a collection of rare recordings on The Viper Label.
In April 2016, Jones's Soothing Music For Stray Cats was reissued on limited edition vinyl via The Viper Label and Mellowtone Records.
In July 2016, Jones put together a backing band for Johnny Echols of Love, for a show at Sefton Park dubbed From Liverpool With Love featuring guest vocalists such as John Power, Dave McCabe and Nick Ellis.
Jones's solo record, entitled The Song Of Day and Night, was released in 2017 on Skeleton Key Records. Jones put together a touring band, dubbed 'The New Joneses' and toured the UK with fellow Skeleton Key acts, headlining the Kristian Ealey Stage at Smithdown Road Festival in Sefton Park's Palmhouse.
Collaborations.
Since the break-up of the Stairs, Jones has worked with Ian McCulloch on "Mysterio" (1992), Paul Weller (live and appears on "Live at the Royal Albert Hall" DVD, 2000), Johnny Marr in an early version of the Healers (where he was replaced by Alonza Bevan previously of Kula Shaker), Saint Etienne, Cherry Ghost on their "Thirst For Romance" (2007) and Lee Mavers following the departure of John Power from the La's.

Sankhenre Sewadjtu

Sankhenre Sewadjtu was the thirty-fourth pharaoh of the Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period. Sewadjtu reigned from Memphis, starting in 1675 BC and for a period of 3 years and 2 to 4 months.
Attestations.
Sankhenre Sewadjtu is unknown from contemporary historical records, and is exclusively attested by the Turin canon. This may be because he ruled Egypt at a time when the 13th Dynasty's control over Egypt was receding. He is listed as the successor of Ini in the Turin Canon, on column 7 line 5, and is given a reign of 3 years and 2 to 4 months in this document.
Kim Ryholt proposes that Sankhenre Sewadjtu is attested on the Karnak king list under a different name owing to a scribal error. Indeed, two prenomina "Sewadjenre" (#33, 59) and two prenomina "Snefer[...]re" (# 42, 60) are recorded in this list but Ryholt points out that, in each case, only one king with such prenomen is known. Ryholt thus proposes that the two remaining names refer to Sankhenre Sewadjtu and Seankhenre Mentuhotepi. Indeed, Ryholt notes that "wadj", "nfr" and "ankh" resemble each other in hieratic.
Chronological position.
The exact chronological position of Sankhenre Sewadjtu in the 13th Dynasty is not known for certain owing to uncertainties affecting earlier kings of the dynasty. Darrell Baker makes him the thirty-fourth pharaoh of the dynasty, Kim Ryholt sees him as the thirty-fifth king and Jürgen von Beckerath places him as the twenty-ninth pharaoh of the dynasty.

Barry McGuigan World Championship Boxing

Barry McGuigan World Championship Boxing is a British video game released in 1985 for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Thomson MO5 and ZX Spectrum by the Gamestar branch of Activision and later re-released by Mastertronic. It was titled Star Rank Boxing in the US (following the Gamestar naming convention: "Star League Baseball", "Starbowl Football").
Gameplay.
1 player.
The player controls a boxer as he boxes his way to the top, earning purse money along the way, progressing up the world rankings until he fights Barry McGuigan himself. Players can create a boxer and customize his style, race, hair and shorts. The player could also choose his next opponent, either at the same ranking, below or above, each with their own lead up time to the fight. The longer the player had until the fight the more time could be spent in the gym, allocating training weeks to the following activities: Weights, sparring, road work, heavy bag or light bag.
Each of these activities had a benefit on the boxer's stamina, strength and endurance. Roadwork, for example, helped with endurance, whilst weights and heavy bag helped with strength.
Before deciding which opponent to fight, a summary is shown of each detailing his attributes. The player can then decide whether take the opponent on. Picking an opponent who is above the player's boxer in the rankings will progress him quicker up the rankings and earn him more money. However, this is risky as higher-ranked fighters are stronger. Some opponents can be beaten quite quickly, whilst others require several rounds of boxing to defeat.
Whilst boxing the following moves can be employed: Cross, block, body punch, jab, hook and uppercut. At the end of each round a summary is given of points scored and the feeling of the audience as to their excitement levels.
2 player.
Each player can choose a boxer from the 20 available, and take part in a 12-round match.
Reception.
Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the game for "Computer Gaming World", and stated that "My belief in sports games is that if they feel like the sport, they must be pretty good. But if they get personally involved in the game as well, they must be great. Star Rank does both and I have no qualms about calling this a great game."
The game was very well received. "Crash" praised the options, graphical detail and animation. "Sinclair User" claimed it was "the best boxing game on the market, for realism it knocks the others for six. It's more complex than "Frank Bruno"'s or "Rocco"", while "Your Sinclair" summarised it as "a top-ten contender in the software boxing championships". Computer Gamer said it was realistic, gripping and long-lasting. The game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind "M.O.V.I.E.".

Sewadjkare Hori

Sewadjkare Hori (also known as Hori II) was a pharaoh of the late 13th Dynasty, possibly the thirty-sixth king of this dynasty. He reigned over Middle and Upper Egypt for five years, either during the early or mid-17th century, from 1669 until 1664 BC or from 1648 until 1643 BC.
Attestation.
Sewadjkare Hori is only known for certain from the Turin canon, row 8, column 7 (Gardiner, von Beckerath: row 7, column 7). The Turin canon provides the prenomen Sewadjkare and the nomen Hori for this king.
Jürgen von Beckerath assigns to him a stone fragment from El-Tod inscribed with the prenomen "Sewadj[...]re". However, since there are two other rulers from the Second Intermediate Period bearing the same prenomen, this identification remains conjectural.
Identity.
Sewadjkare Hori should not be confused with Sewadjkare, a pharaoh of the early 13th Dynasty, and with another Sewadjkare III from the mid 14th Dynasty. Both of these pharaohs enjoyed shorter reigns than Sewadjkare Hori.

HMAS Yarra (U77)

HMAS "Yarra" (U77), named for the Yarra River, was a sloop of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) that served during World War II. Commissioned in 1936, "Yarra" spent the early part of the war in Australian waters, then was transferred to the East Indies Station in 1940. The sloop operated in the Red Sea, then was involved in the Anglo-Iraqi War and the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. After operating as part of the Tobruk Ferry Service in the Mediterranean during November, "Yarra" was reassigned to Southeast Asia in response to Japanese attacks. On 4 March 1942, "Yarra" was attacked and sunk by a force of Japanese cruisers and destroyers while attempting to protect ships withdrawing to Australia.
Design and construction.
The "Grimsby" class consisted of thirteen sloops, four of which were built in Australia for the RAN. "Yarra", one of the first pair, had a displacement of 1,060 tons at standard load and 1,500 tons at full load, was long, had a beam of , and a draught of between depending on load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons geared turbines, which delivered to the sloop's two propeller shafts. Maximum speed was . The ship's company in peacetime consisted of 135 officers and sailors; this increased to 160 during the war.
"Yarra"s armament consisted of three QF Mk V anti-aircraft guns along with small calibre weapons.
"Yarra" was laid down by the Cockatoo Island Dockyard at Sydney, New South Wales on 24 May 1934, launched on 28 March 1935 by Florence Parkhill, the wife of Archdale Parkhill, Minister for Defence, and commissioned into the RAN on 21 January 1936.
Operational history.
In December 1939, "Yarra" was attached to the 20th Minesweeping Flotilla. On 28 August 1940, the sloop sailed from Fremantle for service on the East Indies Station. She arrived in Aden on 18 September, then was assigned to convoy operations in the Red Sea.
On 20 October, "Yarra" was part of the escort for Allied convoy BN 7. The convoy was attacked by a force of Italian destroyers; these were driven off, with the forced aground. During the action, two torpedoes were fired by the Italians at "Yarra"; the sloop successfully evaded both.
From March until April 1941, "Yarra" was docked at Bombay for refitting. On 12 April, the sloop joined the escort of Convoy BP7 from Karachi to the port of Basra, in the Persian Gulf. After arriving in the gulf, "Yarra" became involved in the Anglo-Iraqi War. During August, the ship operated in Iranian waters in support of the Anglo-Soviet invasion. The sloop secured several ports and oil-producing facilities, sank the sloop , and was involved in the capture of two Iranian gunboats and the Italian ship "Hilda". In November, the sloop was transferred to the Mediterranean, and operated as part of the Tobruk Ferry Service.
In December, the Japanese declaration of war saw "Yarra" reassigned to Southeast Asia. She left Alexandria on 9 December and reached Java on 11 January 1942, where she commenced convoy escort duties. On 5 February, the sloop escorted a convoy to Singapore; the last convoy to arrive before the city was captured by the Japanese. While en route, the convoy was attacked by Japanese aircraft: "Yarra" shot down one and damaged several others, then rescued over 1,800 soldiers from the burning troopship . On 6 February, the sloop left Singapore with a southbound convoy. "Yarra" left the convoy when near Palembang to take up the tow of the disabled destroyer , with the two ships successfully reaching Tanjong Priok.
Loss.
The deterioration of the Allied position in Southeast Asia promoted a general withdrawal south. On 2 March, "Yarra" arrived at Tjilatjap with the depot ship "Anking", the tanker "Francol", and the minesweeper "MMS-51": the sloop was ordered to escort the other three ships to Fremantle. A day later, the ship rescued forty survivors of the Dutch ship "Paragi" from liferafts.
Early on 4 March 1942, the convoy encountered a Japanese fleet: the cruisers , , and , accompanied by four destroyers. "Yarra"s commander, Robert William Rankin, laid down a smokescreen, then ordered the convoy to scatter while the sloop held off the Japanese warships. Despite the efforts of "Yarra", the other three Allied ships were pursued and sunk, and the sloop was sunk by cruiser gunfire shortly after 08:00, with only 34 survivors from the ship's company and the "Paragi" rescuees. Attrition reduced the number of survivors to 13 by the time they were rescued on 9 March by the Dutch submarine .
The ship's fate inspired the film "Always Another Dawn" (1948).
The sloop's wartime service was later recognised with two battle honours: "Libya 1941" and "East Indies 1942". In March 2013, Governor-General Quentin Bryce announced that a Unit Citation for Gallantry would be retroactively awarded to the ship's company of "Yarra" at the time of her sinking. This was presented to the Chief of Navy and the ship's company of the minehunter , on the River Yarra, on 4 March 2014, the anniversary of the sloop "Yarra"s loss.

<doc id="6927130" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6927130" title="Solomon Ettinger">
Solomon Ettinger

Solomon Ettinger (, 1802–1856) was a 19th-century Yiddish- and Hebrew-language playwright, poet and writer of songs and fables whose emblematic play "Serkele" has remained a classic of the Yiddish theatre. His given name has appeared variously as Salomon or Shlomo or Shloyme and his family name has also been rendered as Ettingher.
Ettinger was born in Warsaw; after being orphaned at an early age, he was raised in Łęczna by a paternal uncle, Mendel Ettinger, a rabbi who was proficient in German, and open to allowing his nephew to explore aspects of the Enlightenment as part of his education. 
At the age of 15, Solomon Ettinger entered into an arranged marriage with Golda, the daughter of magnate Judah Leib Wolf, of Zamość. The young couple moved to Zamość, and lived with Golda's parents. There Ettinger came under the influence of the Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment movement.
By 1795, Poland had been partitioned between Prussia, Russia and Austria. Zamość was in the Austrian partition, but the residents spoke primarily Polish and Zamość had a large Jewish population.
Eventually, he traveled to the big town of the Austrian partition, the primarily Polish-Ukrainian city of Lviv (then often known as Lemberg), to study medicine at its renowned University. After years of learning, he graduated with a medical degree and returned to his native region, but was unable to practice as a physician. By 1832 the city of Zamość, where Ettinger now lived, had been incorporated into the Russian partition, the most intolerant of the three. Anti-Jewish pogroms were frequent and Ettinger's degree was declared invalid, because it came from an ostensibly foreign institution.
After numerous attempts at other professions, including an unsuccessful period with an agricultural group, Ettinger settled in Odessa, a Russian Black Sea port with a substantial number of Jewish residents, and attempted to make a living as a writer, while supplementing his income with various short-lived jobs. Much of what he has written is now lost, but his sketches, poetry and songs were published in various Yiddish-language periodicals of the time. His only surviving dramas are fragments of two plays "Der Feter fun America" ("The Uncle from America") and "Freleche Yungeleut" ("Carefree Youth") found after his death, and the play that keeps his name alive and is still performed by Yiddish theaters around the world, "Serkele", which, while written when Ettinger was in his twenties, and performed during his lifetime, was first published posthumously in 1861.
"Serkele" is one of the most renowned plays in the entire repertoire of the Yiddish theater and owes its high reputation to its strong sense of form, sound and rhythm. The characters are delineated in a masterful style comparable to that of the most esteemed dramatists and its outlook remains alive and fresh after 180 years. The Yiddish linguistic stylization in "Serkele" and the two fragmentary plays is crisp and self-assured, displaying a mastery of the medium. Renowned Yiddish playwrights who flourished immediately after Ettinger, such as Abraham Goldfaden and Jacob Gordin have written how much they were influenced by "Serkele".
No clear details have emerged as to the circumstances of his death. Such writings of his that did survive were preserved by his family and published posthumously, in most cases, decades after their author's death.

Breuil-Cervinia

Breuil-Cervinia (; ; Valdôtain: ), officially Le Breuil from September 2023, is a of the "comune" of Valtournenche, Italy. It is a winter and summer tourist resort.
Etymology.
The name "Breuil-Cervinia" is a fusion of two terms. On the one hand was "Breuil", in French, the original name of the place before the tourist settlement was built, derived from Valdôtain dialect "Breuill" indicating a marshy meadow, or a field where streams are numerous. "Breuil" and its derived forms have commonly appeared in Aosta Valley, France, and Romandy. On the other was "Cervinia", the toponym that was given to the hamlet following the process of italianization of placenames in the Aosta Valley wanted by the fascist government, a reference to the Matterhorn mountain (italian: "Monte" "Cervino)".
2023 name change.
In April 2023, the municipal council of Valtournenche unanimously voted in favour of adopting the toponym "Le Breuil", proposed by a toponomy commission of the Aosta Valley autonomous region. The name change was part of an effort that started in 2011 to redefine all the local toponyms that resulted in 52 name changes. In September 2023, a decree of the president of Aosta Valley officially changed the name of the hamlet from "Breuil-Cervinia" to "Le Breuil". The name change sparked criticism due to concerns about potential bureaucratic complications as well as damage to the tourism industry., with tourism minister Daniela Santanchè urging the local council to "think again". The municipal council of Valtournenche, which had voted in favour for the proposal, including mayor Elisa Cicco and former mayor Jean-Antoine Maquignaz, claimed there had been a "misunderstanding". Cicco admitted that "no one wanted to cancel the name Cervinia," and "it is our brand, our brand by which we are known throughout the world". Just 24 hours after the official name change, Mayor Elisa Cicco and President of Aosta Valley Renzo Testolin started the procedure to restore the toponym. On March 8, 2024, the municipal council declared that the toponym "Breuil-Cervinia" would be requested, and that the names of all the hamlets would be asked to be reviewed. The review process is expected to be completed within 12 months.
Ultimately, in January 2025, the village was officially renamed "Breuil-Cervinia," combining the historical name with the well-known touristic name. This decision was criticized by local associations, which described it as a blow to the region's cultural and linguistic heritage, noting that the previous name had been well-received by cultural associations and residents.
Geography.
Breuil-Cervinia lies at above sea level, at the foot of the Matterhorn, in the Valtournenche valley and surrounded by the Jumeaux, the Château des Dames, the Furggen and the Grandes Murailles summits. It shares a ski area with Zermatt through the Plateau Rosa glacier ().
The ski season in Breuil-Cervinia lasts not only 6 months in winter but also in summer on the Plateau Rosa glacier. The Theodul Pass lies on the territory of Breuil-Cervinia. The village is divided by the Marmore creek.
Climate.
Breuil-Cervinia being one of Europe's highest ski resorts, its climate features low temperatures and consistent snow falls. Temperatures get very cold through the winter months with daily averages being around for the winter months and only about in the summer months. This maintains the snow in great shape throughout the winter season. December usually averages round in resort and on the mountain, January approx , February approx , March , April .
History.
Breuil-Cervinia has a short history. Until the beginning of the 19th century, the Breuil basin was just a pasture, with a group of shepherds living in a few alpine cottages only in summer. However, in the Middle Ages, the Breuil was an important crossroad for merchants who had to cross the Alps and for the settlement of the Walser community in the near the Ayas and Lys valleys.
The real growth of the town began in the 1850s with the birth of alpinism all over the Alps. The explorations of Horace-Bénedict de Saussure through the Savoy Alps in the 1700s heightened interest in the Matterhorn and the other mountains of the Savoyard state, particularly among the English bourgeoisie, who were increasingly interested in wilderness travel.
Resident shepherds, such as Jean-Antoine Carrel, had long looked upon their home mountain as something attainable, and made the first attempts to ascend the Matterhorn from the south face. Many European mountain climbers saw the Matterhorn as a great challenge, and the arrival of John Tyndall and Edward Whymper in Breuil began competition for the first complete ascent, aided by Jean-Antoine's knowledge of the territory. The construction of some bases became necessary. Some examples are the first Refuge du Théodule (built in 1852) at 3317 m (10882.6 ft), the Jumeaux Hotel and the Hôtel du Cervin.
After years of collaboration with Jean-Antoine Carrel, the competition was won by Edward Whymper in 1865, after he realised that the Hörnli ridge was easier to climb. Only three days later, Jean-Antoine Carrel was able to climb the Matterhorn by the more difficult Lion ridge. After Edward Whymper's ascent team on the north face met with disaster while returning to Zermatt, Amé Gorret, a fellow climber and fellow countryman of Jean-Antoine Carrel, realised that tourism in Breuil could be increased by building the first alpine refuge on the Matterhorn. Amé Gorret asked the Italian Alpine Club to support his project, which resulted the refuge located at the "Cravate" (4,120 m) of the Matterhorn, inaugurated in 1867.
As a result of the exploratory drive and the newborn mountaineering movement, the "Società Guide del Cervino" (it.) / "Société des guides du Cervin" (fr.), one of the oldest mountain guide societies in the world, was founded in Breuil in 1865.
The first hotels began to be built in the area and the town began to develop from a simple alpine pasture to a tourist destination. With the emergence of ski mountaineering, the Breuil slopes became the destination of the first skiers, accelerating the transformation into a top tourist destination.
A number of entrepreneurs from Piedmont, driven by the desire to build new hydroelectric plants on behalf of the "Società Idroelettrica Piemontese," explore the side valleys of the Aosta Valley, including the Valtournenche Valley. During the explorations and the first construction of hydroelectric plants in the lower part of the Valtournenche Valley, the entrepreneur and engineer Dino Lora Totino saw in Breuil the possibility of creating a first-class tourist resort. In 1934, together with other Piedmontese entrepreneurs, Dino Lora Totino founded the "Società Anonima Cervino", with the aim of transforming Breuil into an important tourist destination by building modern ski lifts.
In 1934, the road connecting the main town of Valtournenche, Pâquier, to Breuil was built. Two years later, the "Breuil - Plan Maison" cable car (2,555 m) was inaugurated.
During 1939 Breuil was renamed "Cervinia" because of the fascist project of Italianization of Aosta Valley's toponyms. 1939 also had been the year of a big venture: the highest skilift in Italy was opened, linking Plan Maison with the Testa Grigia at 3480 m (11417 ft), near the Swiss border. An observatory for cosmic ray physics and the physics of the Earth's atmosphere was also built near Plateau Rosa and is now used as a meteorological station run by the Italian Air Force.
After the World War II, the first ski lifts were built around Breuil-Cervinia and Plan Maison. In 1952, again at the instigation of Dino Lora Totino, a new cable car was built from Plan Maison to Furggen. It was a single-span cable car, and was so long that the designer had to take the curvature of the Earth into account when designing it. The cableway and its associated slope were so impervious that, following the death of several people who had fallen from the Furggen, it was necessary to build a tunnel onto the mountain, which would make it easier for skiers and the operators of the "Società Cervino" to descend to the glacier below, avoiding the more inexperienced skiers from having to use the more exposed part of the slope.
Also in the 1950s, Breuil-Cervinia, Plateau Rosa and the Matterhorn were chosen by the Italian Alpine Club and Ardito Desio as locations to prepare the famous 1954 K2 expedition, which included Achille Compagnoni and Walter Bonatti.
In 1961, the Plan Maison-Cime Bianche-Plateau Rosa cable car was replaced by a new system built by "Piemonte Funivie". In 1963, the Breuil-Plan Maison cable car, the first cable car to be built in Breuil-Cervinia, was replaced by a new, large cable car, and a second cable car was built next to it in order to double the hourly capacity of the ski lifts.
In 1962, the "Lac Bleu" bobsleigh track was completed near the Lago Blu and inaugurated by Olympic champion Eugenio Monti.
In 1972, the first two-seater chairlift was built at "Cielo Alto". The unification in 1982 with the Valtournenche ski resort added prestige to Cervinia. In 1986, the "Breuil-Plan Maison 1 cable car" was replaced by a 6-passenger gondola lift and in 1988, the long "Plan Maison-Laghi Cime Bianche gondola lift" was opened. In 1991 the "Plateau Rosa cable car" was replaced by a cable car with 140-passenger cabins.
In 1993, the Furggen cable car was closed and abandoned, as it was hardly used due to the wind and also heavily damaged in an accident.
In the 2000s, the "Società Cervino" encountered considerable financial difficulties and was unable to invest in the station. In 2006, thanks to regional funding, it was possible to build two modern chairlifts, called "Crétaz" and "Campetto", to replace the old ski lifts. In 2008, increasing financial difficulties led the Cravetto family, the historic owners of the Breuil-Cervinia ski lifts, to decide to sell its majority shares in "Società Cervino". These were bought by the Autonomous Region Aosta Valley (about 70%; the remaining 30% was managed by private individuals), and the company thus became public, like most of its "Aosta Valley" counterparts operating in the sector. The first step of the new management towards modernisation was taken in 2009, with the inauguration of the "Pancheron" hexapost chairlift. In 2012 the "Plateau Rosa cable car" is renewed.
Thanks to its rapid growth, Cervinia and its ski resort, as many other town on the Alps like Courmayeur, Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, Limone Piemonte, Pila, Sestriere, Zermatt, Sankt Moritz, became a field of architectural and engineering experimentation, trying to develop a new "alpine architecture" and new technologies for buildings and lifts. Examples of this research are the Cielo Alto buildings, the Casa del Sole, the original Refuge du Théodule, the Pirovano hut and, as far as ski lifts are concerned, the "Breuil-Plan Maison cable car" and the Gran Baita hotel, the "Plateau Rosa cable car", the "Plan Maison - Monte Furggen cable car". The architects who oversaw the urban development of the town include important names such as Carlo Mollino, Francesco Dolza, Giovanni Muzio, Franco Albini and Mario Galvagni.
Economy.
Today Breuil-Cervinia is fully dependent on tourism, both during winter and summer, thanks to the possibility of summer ski on the Plateau Rosa Glacier and the ski lifts links of "Matterhorn Ski Paradise", the beauty of its alpine landscape and the presence of the Matterhorn.
In summer, the plains of Breuil-Cervinia are home to alpine pastures with cows whose milk is used to produce the first Aosta Valley cheese, Fontina, and other toma cheeses.
Sports.
Alpine skiing.
The ski area is very large and guarantees good snow quality during the season, being at a high altitude (2,050 m to 3,500 m).
Breuil-Cervinia is connected, weather permitting, with Zermatt (when the Italian lifts are open) via the Plateau Rosa glacier, where summer skiing is also practised, and with the part of the Valtournenche ski resort via the Cime Bianche mountain pass.
Breuil-Cervinia hosted the Women's Alpine Ski World Cup in the 1977–1978 season on 10 December 1977, the first time in the history of the alpine resort, with a slalom stage on the "Cielo Alto" slope. The competition was won by French skier Perrine Pelen, followed by her compatriot Fabienne Serrat and Hanni Wenzel, who won the general and the slalom rankings for the season.
From the 2022–2023 season, Breuil-Cervinia and Zermatt (Switzerland) will host a cross-border stage of the Alpine Ski World Cup. This will be the first time in the history of the Cup. The races to be held will be downhill and super-g, both men's and women's. The designated slope is the "Gran Becca," the result of a mixture of several slopes in the "Matterhorn Ski Paradise" resort: the athletes will start from the 3,899 m of the Gobba di Rollin, a mountain in Swiss territory, will take the "Ventina" slope, in Italian territory, and will arrive near the "Cime Bianche Laghi - Plateau Rosa" cable car station. The name "Gran Becca" is Matterhorn in Valdôtain dialect.
A special and spectacular event related to alpine skiing in Breuil-Cervinia was "Azzurrissimo", a skiing competition held on the "Ventina" slope, 11 kilometres long and delimited by the symbolic number of 100 gates. Ski clubs, sports centres, military sports groups, but also ordinary people, show business people, journalists and athletes took part in the event. The spirit of the competition was based on the confrontation of all against all on skis, mixing the different disciplines of alpine skiing in a single event. It became an international event, with the participation of athletes from different nations and the creation of a network of events twinned with "Azzurrissimo" in Crans-Montana and Baqueira-Beret. The first edition of "Azzurrissimo" was in 1987 and the tenth and last was in 1998. It was run in the first few days of May, at the end of the racing season and at the end of the various championships. This allowed the presence of big names in the discipline and the awarding of the prize for the "fastest ski club in Italy".
Cross-country skiing.
In winter Breuil-Cervinia hosts a cross-country skiing trail on the plains near the town centre.
Snowboard cross.
Breuil-Cervinia has hosted the Snowboard Cross World Cup four times, in the 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2022 seasons, making it a fixed stop on the circuit. Breuil-Cervinia was also supposed to host a stage in the 2021 season, which was cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
Cycling.
Breuil-Cervinia has hosted a stage of the most famous cycling race in Italy Tour of Italy five times, in 1960, 1997, 2012, 2015 and 2018.
The streets of Breuil-Cervinia have also hosted several editions of the Aosta Valley - Mont Blanc Tour, an event dedicated to the under-23s road cyclists and which has launched many internationally renowned cyclists such as Ivan Gotti and Fabio Aru.
In summer, downhill biking can be practised on equipped trails. The "Maxiavalanche" competition, which is organised around August and consists of a descent from the 3500 m of the Plateau Rosa glacier to Breuil-Cervinia, is well known. In 2011, two more tracks were added, bringing the number of downhill and freeride tracks to four. As of 2014, the number of trails is nine, including those that run towards the village of Valtournenche. The resort is relying heavily on this activity to boost summer tourism.
Bobsleigh.
The "Lac Bleu" bobsleigh run was located in Breuil-Cervinia and hosted the World Championships three times: in 1971, 1975 and 1985; it also hosted the European Championships on four occasions: in 1969, 1973, 1987 and 1991. In 1991, it was definitively closed down due to the very high running costs and the cost of renovations that the track would have had to undergo.
The bobsleigh track could have been an Olympic facility on two occasions: first, when the city of Aosta was bidding to host the 18th Winter Olympics in 1998, which was then awarded to the city of Nagano. The second was when the facility was considered for the bobsleigh, skeleton and luge competitions of the XX Winter Olympics in Turin in 2006, but the choice was made to build the Olympic facility in Cesana Pariol.
Speed skiing.
Breuil-Cervinia was the scene of several editions of speed skiing competitions. The slope was often the only one on the circuit that allowed new records to be set in the discipline.
Zeno Colò set a record of 159.291 km/h here in 1947 that stood for 13 years, using normal skis and skiing without a helmet. Even Steve McKinney, the first person to break 200 km/h on skis, ran speed skiing competitions in Breuil-Cervinia.
In 2005, the Speed Skiing World Championships were held in Breuil-Cervinia.
Ski touring.
Ski touring in Breuil-Cervinia is a real symbol. Before the ski lifts were built, the ski fields were invaded by ski tourers starting from Breuil-Cervinia, arriving at Plan Maison and, for the most experienced and daring, reaching Plateau Rosa, before descending back into the valley.
Breuil-Cervinia, together with Gressoney-La-Trinité, hosts one of the oldest and most historic ski touring competitions: the Mezzalama Trophy.
Events.
Since 1998, Breuil-Cervinia hosts the "Cervino CineMountain", a film festival focusing on mountain, adventure, exploring and nature documentaries. Cervino CineMountain is a member of the "International Alliance for Mountain Film" and awards the Oscar for the best mountain film from the various mountain film festivals that are members of the Alliance. The Cervino CineMountain also awards Grand Prizes, prizes for feature, medium and short films and for animated films.
Since 2019, in the month of July, Breuil-Cervinia hosts "La Settimana del Cervino", an event that encourages contact with nature, environmental sustainability and respect for the mountain environment with a series of cultural meetings between people from the entertainment industry, athletes, experts on the subject of mountains and nature, as well as evening shows, concerts and walks aimed at raising awareness of the aforementioned subjects around the village of Breuil-Cervinia.

Lemon Tree (Fool's Garden song)

"Lemon Tree" is a song by German band Fool's Garden from their third album, "Dish of the Day" (1995). The band's lead vocalist, Peter Freudenthaler, said that he wrote the song on a Sunday afternoon when he was waiting for his girlfriend who did not come. It was released as a single in November 1995 by Intercord and Encore Records and became an international hit the following year, remaining at number one for four weeks in Germany and also topping the charts of Austria, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden. In the United Kingdom, the song reached number 26 on the UK Singles Chart. The band recorded a new version of the song for the 2009 compilation album "High Times – The Best of Fools Garden".
Critical reception.
Pan-European magazine "Music &amp; Media" wrote, "This song by the eclectic German quintet has reached number 10 in the GSA Major Market Airplay chart and with good reason. The track is a cross between a catchy circus tune and late '60s bubblegum pop with trademark harmonies, which should appeal to the broadest of radio audiences."
Covers and parodies.
Dustin the Turkey recorded a Christmas-parody called "Christmas Tree". Taiwanese singer Tarcy Su released covers of the song (in both Mandarin and Cantonese) as did Korean singer Park Hye Kyung. Taiwanese-American singer-songwriter Joanna Wang made a cover of the song in 2011. Korean singer and composer, Hongjoong of the group Ateez, released a cover of the song on 4 May 2022.
Alle Farben and Fool's Garden version.
On 8 January 2021, Alle Farben with Fool's Garden released a cover of "Lemon Tree".

Adélard Langevin

Louis Philippe Adélard Langevin (; August 23, 1855 – June 15, 1915) was a Canadian Oblate priest and Archbishop of Saint-Boniface. He founded the "La Liberté" newspaper published in Manitoba on May 20, 1913. He was the energetic leader of the Catholic struggle to restore language and religious rights in the Manitoba Schools Question.
Life.
Langevin was born in Saint-Isidore, near La Prairie, Lower Canada, one of sixteen children of François-Théophile and Marie-Paméla Racicot Langevin. In 1875 he entered the Sulpician Grand Séminaire de Montréal and then studied at Jesuit St. Mary's College, the English branch of the Collège Sainte-Marie de Montréal.
Langevin joined the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate at Lachinein 1881, and was ordained a priest the following year by Monsignor Édouard-Charles Fabre, Bishop of Montreal. After his ordination, Langevin preached retreats and temperance crusades throughout the diocese of Montreal. He contracted smallpox during the epidemic of 1885. 
Langevin became director of the major seminary in Ottawa and taught moral theology at the University of Ottawa. In 1890, he was appointed vice-dean of the Faculty of Theology at the University of Ottawa. He went to Paris to attended the general chapter of the Oblates.
In 1892 he received the degree of D.D. That same year, fellow Oblate Alexandre-Antonin Taché, Archbishop of Saint Boniface, requested Langevin be assigned to Manitoba as superior of the oblates in the archdiocese. He was also made rector of the English-speaking parish of St. Mary's in Winnipeg. 
Archbishop.
Upon the death of Taché in June 1894, Langevin was named to succeed him as Archbishop of Saint Boniface. He was installed in 1895. During his episcopacy, Langevin was concerned with the question of the educational rights of Catholics on the Prairies after the abolition of the denominational school system in 1890. A defender of equality between French and English Canadians, Langevin had a number of confrontations with Anglophone Catholic leaders. He believed that the viability of Catholic culture in North America depended on both language and denominational instruction, and was not satisfied with the adoption of the Laurier-Greenway regulations in 1896, which allowed education in a language other than English, under certain conditions, and which authorized religious education in public schools after school hours.
Langevin believed that the new immigrants could become good Canadians while remaining faithful Catholics. He hoped that the new communities settling in the West could keep their language and their religion and fought for the diversity of cultures by offering new immigrants services in their language. To this end, Holy Ghost Parish was established in North Winnipeg to serve Polish Catholics. In 1904, St. Joseph's was founded for the German Catholics. The French church of Sacré Coeur was dedicated in 1905 for former parishioners of St. Mary's. Langevin was unfamiliar with the Eastern rite, and thought that the many Ukrainian immigrants settling around Winnipeg would do better to adapt to the Rite of their new country. The Ukrainians were reluctant to take up the Latin rite, which to them was foreign. Around 1902, Oblate missioner Albert Lacombe had persuaded some Basilian Fathers to establish a mission at Beaver Lake in Alberta. Impressed with their work, Langevin wrote the Basilian superior requesting priests for the Ukrainians of Winnipeg. Two Basilian priests arrived by the end of 1903. Langevin built for them St. Nicholas Church and rectory. Members of the Sisters Servants of Mary Immaculate established a mission at St. Nicholas in 1905. In 1911, Langevin built them a school. The Apostolic Exarchate of Canada was established in 1912. 
He promoted the establishment of around twenty religious communities in its archdiocese. In 1898, Langevin asked the Soeurs de Misericorde from Montreal to assist unwed mothers. They opened, in 1900, a maternity hospital which later developed into Misericordia Health Centre. 
In 1902, he co-founded the Société historique de Saint-Boniface and the "Les Cloches de Saint-Boniface". 
He died at Montreal on June 16, 1915 and was buried in the St. Boniface Cathedral Cemetery.
Legacy.
The Rue Langevin in the Saint-Boniface area of Winnipeg is named for him.

Claros

Claros (; , "Klaros"; ) was an ancient Greek sanctuary on the coast of Ionia. It contained a temple and oracle of Apollo, honored here as Apollo Clarius. It was located in the territory of Colophon, which lay twelve kilometers to the north, one of the twelve cities of the Ionian League. The coastal city Notion lay two kilometers to the south. The ruins of the sanctuary are now found north of the modern town Ahmetbeyli in the Menderes district of İzmir Province, Turkey.
The Temple of Apollo at Claros was a very important center of prophecy, as in Delphi and Didyma. The oldest literary information about this sacred site goes back to the sixth and seventh centuries BC, through the Homeric Hymns, though Proto-Geometric pottery at the site betokens 9th century occupation. A sacred cave near the Temple of Apollo, which was an important place both in the Hellenistic and Roman eras, points to the existence of a Cybele cult in early periods here. Games called the Claria were held at Claros every fifth year in honor of Apollo.
History.
It is unknown when the sanctuary was founded exactly and its origins are shrouded in mythology. Archaeological excavations revealed structures dating back to the 10th century BC. The high point for the fame of the sanctuary seems to have been the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD and it had many visitors until the 4th century AD.
Materials and source.
In the late Hellenistic period, a cargo ship carrying marble sank on its way to Claros off the southwest coast of modern-day Turkey near Kizilburun. The ship was discovered in 1993, and has been under excavation since 2005. On this ship, an estimated fifty tons of marble columns were recovered that matched the description of the columns found at Claros, the temple of Apollo. Isotopic and meteorological data indicate Proconnesos in the Sea of Marmara as the source of the marble. The marble being imported from the island to be used at the site was a special type with distinctive blue and white bands known as Proconnesian marble. The marble did not complete its 350 kilometer journey.
Foundation.
The founding myth of Claros connects the city with the myth of the Epigoni who conquered Thebes. The two seers Teiresias and his daughter Manto became their captives along with other Thebans. The Epigoni sent them to Delphi to honor Apollo, but Teiresias died on the journey. At Delphi, Manto was commanded by Apollo to sail to Ionia with the remaining Thebans to found a colony there. When they arrived at the site where Claros would be founded later, they were seized by armed Cretans under Rhacius, the Cretan settler of Caria. After learning from Manto who they were and why they had come, Rhacius married her and allowed the Thebans to found Claros. Their heir was the seer Mopsus.
Thus the origin of the oracle at Clarus was remembered by Greeks of the Classical period as Minoan-Mycenean in origin. Archaeological investigations lend support to the myth. Intensely settled Mycenaean sites have been identified at Ephesus to the south and numerous other nearby sites. Miletus had a historical Minoan settlement, discovered in 1995/96 by the German school. In Claros itself, deep exploratory trenches dug between the altar and the temple façade, revealed Protogeometric pottery of the 10th century BC, attesting to the presence hinted at in myth.
At Colophon, a Mycenaean-era tomb has been found, but the presence of Mycenaean pottery is uncertain.
According to mythology the Greek seer Calchas, a participant in the Trojan War, died at Claros. He challenged Mopsus to see who had the greatest skill in divination, but lost and died of grief.
Hellenistic period.
According to legend the oracle at Claros advised the citizens of Smyrna to move from Old Smyrna to the new Smyrna on Mount Pagos (modern Kadifekale), which was refounded there by Alexander the Great. The Smyrnaeans decided to follow up on the advice. Old Smyrna had lost its importance at the time, but after its second foundation it would become one of the most prosperous cities of Asia.
Roman period.
Many monuments were erected in the Roman period (Pompey, Lucullus, Quintus Tullius Cicero); several took place above Hellenistic foundations. Pliny the Elder remarks that "At Colophon, in the cave of the Clarian Apollo, there is a pool, by the drinking of which a power is acquired of uttering wonderful oracles; but the lives of those who drink of it are shortened". Iamblichus said that the oracle, during the ecstasy “... is not in control of himself and does not follow what he is saying, or where he is...” Germanicus famously visited the oracle in 18 AD (a year before his death) and "It was said that he prophesied to Germanicus, in dark hints, as oracles usually do, an early doom".
Excavations.
Claros had been entirely buried in the alluvial silt deposited by the small river at the site, a widespread phenomenon along this coastline during the 1st century BC, as the hinterland was deforested. T. Macridy uncovered the monumental entrance to the sanctuary in 1905 and returned for further explorations with the French archaeologist Charles Picard in 1913. Excavations recommenced between 1950 and 1961 under Louis Robert, and a series of important Roman dedicated monuments came to light, as well as the famous Doric Temple of Apollo, seat of the oracle, in its final grand though uncompleted Hellenistic phase, 3rd century BC. The Sacred Way was excavated in 1988 under J. de La Genière. Since then much alluvial spoil has been carted off-site and Claros was prepared to receive visitors.
The excavations conducted since 1988 have demonstrated that there was a religious area there around a spring of fresh water from the 9th century BC. The first known construction is a round altar of the second half of the 7th century. It was covered over around the middle of the 6th century by a large rectangular altar (14.85 × 6.05 m); at the same time a marble temple was built for Apollo around the spring while Apollo's sister, Artemis, had her own precinct and a smaller altar (3.50 × 150 m): next to it were found the bases of two korai, one of which is preserved (the head is missing). There were at least four statues of kouroi dedicated to Apollo; three of them, incomplete, have been found.
Very few changes occurred in the sanctuary between the 6th and the end of the 4th century. At that time a new layout of the sacred area was conceived, with monuments on a larger scale; most probably, the plans were put into execution only after the terrible events of the beginning of the 3rd century BC. Later in the 3rd century construction began on the new altar and the new Temple of Apollo. It had a dark crypt-like adyton from where the oracle delivered his prophecies. Today it is well preserved and its narrow, dark and vaulted labyrinthine corridors remain.
Above the ground, remains can be seen of the base and fragments of the colossal sculptures of a seated Apollo with his lyre, accompanied by Leto and Artemis, facing to the east. The group, whose fragments are partially reassembled at the site, seems to have measured more than seven meters in height. In the sanctuary, rows of names of the countless grateful ancient visitors may still be seen, votive and memorial inscriptions on columns, on steps and walls and even on a curving marble bench: in their entirety the inscription of Clarus form the largest assembly of surviving Greek inscriptions. An elegant marble chair in the sanctuary has serpent arms, a reminder of the chthonic nature of all genuine oracles among the Hellenes, and which likely reflects Apollo's conquering of Python and subsequent establishment of the temple at Delphi.
After the beginning of the Roman Province of Asia (end of the 2nd century BC), prominent citizens of Colophon helped to increase the authority of the sanctuary, the importance of the religious competitions and the fame of the oracle. To celebrate the major sacrifices before crowds consisting of Greeks and non-Greeks, four rows of iron rings attached to heavy blocks allowed a hundred victims to be killed simultaneously. Claros is the only sanctuary in the Greek world which offers a clear picture of the way priests could perform the hecatomb.

Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma

The Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma is the largest Christian denomination in Fiji, with 34.6% of the total population at the most recent 2007 census. 
Along with the chiefly system and the Fijian government, the Methodist Church forms a key part of Fiji's social power structure. The President of the Church, who must have been an ordained Minister for at least ten years, is elected at the annual conference for a term not exceeding three years. Tevita Nawadra Banivanua was elected President of the Church at the 2014 annual conference, and took office on 1 January 2015. He succeeded Tuikilakila Waqairatu.
Church organization.
The Church has 2,860 congregations served by 430 pastors. Administratively, the church is divided into 338 circuits and 56 divisions. In the 1996 census, 280,628 persons identified as Methodists; 261,972 were indigenous Fijians, 5,432 were Indo-Fijians and 13,224 were from other ethnic communities. In 2015, its membership stood at 212,860.
Church history and affiliation.
Christianity was introduced into Fiji in 1830 by three Tahitian teachers from the London Missionary Society. The Australian-based Wesleyan Missionary Society began work in Lakeba in the Lau Islands on 12 October 1835 under David Cargill and William Cross, along with some Tongans. The conversion of many prominent chiefs, including Seru Epenisa Cakobau, in 1854, led to the conversion of much of the population.
Large-scale Indian immigration to Fiji began in 1879, and the Indian Mission began in 1892.
In 1964 the Methodist Church in Fiji became an independent entity.
The Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma is a member of the World Council of Churches (since 1976), the Pacific Conference of Churches, the Fiji Council of Churches, and the World Methodist Council.
The 2006 coup d'état.
The Methodist Church opposed the 2006 coup, although it had backed the previous three coups. 
The Methodist Church strongly condemned the coup d'état carried out by the Republic of Fiji Military Forces on 5 December 2006. The church issued a 20-point statement on 2 February 2007 analyzing the various factors in the coup, including the actions of the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, to depose and reinstate President Ratu Josefa Iloilo, dismiss the Cabinet, and dissolve the Parliament, all of which it said were legally actionable. The statement called on Bainimarama to resign as interim Prime Minister to allow a "politically neutral" interim cabinet to be formed, comprising respected citizens. The Church also called for the 86-year-old President Iloilo, who publicly condoned the actions of the Military, to be "medically boarded" and, if necessary, "retired with dignity."
While condemning the coup, the statement stopped short of calling for the deposed government to be reinstated, instead recognizing the reality that normal democratic rule needed a process to restore it.
The statement of the Methodist Church provoked an angry reaction from Military spokesman Major Neumi Leweni, who said that the Church had allowed itself to be "used".
In the past, the Church once called for a theocracy and fueled anti-Hindu sentiment.

Thompson Chain-Reference Bible

The Thompson Chain-Reference Bible is a Christian study Bible originally published by the Kirkbride Bible Company and now published by Zondervan.
History.
The Thompson Chain-Reference system was devised by its namesake, Frank Charles Thompson, in the early 1900s, but the original work was started in 1890. Thompson was born in 1858, in Elmira, New York, and was ordained in 1879. His wife was Laura Boughton Thompson. He began work on the system because of his dissatisfaction with the reference Bibles that were then available to preachers:
Dr. Thompson believed the Bible should be presented in a simple, but scholarly way. He saw the need for a well-organized reference Bible that would be of practical use to the layman as well as a minister. In 1890, Dr. Thompson began the work he would continue for the rest of his life. He completed the "thought suggestions" opposite the verses throughout the Bible. These are what became the "chain-links" that are the heart of the Thompson system. Some of the men in Dr. Thompson's church saw his Bible and told him this would be a great help to them in their Bible study too. They encouraged Dr. Thompson to have his Bible, with marginal references, published so that everyone could enjoy the blessing of this helpful study tool.
The first version of Thompson's study Bible was published in 1908 by the Methodists Book Concern of Dobbs Ferry, New York. Five years later, in 1913, Thompson was joined by B. B. Kirkbride, of Indianapolis, Indiana. The two men formed the Kirkbride Bible Company in order to further improve and distribute Thompson's work.
The original Thompson Chain-Reference Bible, as well as several subsequent versions, were based on the King James Bible. Currently, editions based on the King James Version, New King James Version, New International Version (1978 version; now out of print), New American Standard Bible (1977 version), and English Standard Version are available, as well as electronic versions that incorporate other features.
, more than four million Thompson Chain-Reference Bibles have been sold.
On December 3, 2020, HarperCollins Christian Publishing announced its acquisition of the Thompson Chain-Reference Bible product assets from Kirkbride Bible Company. The Bible brand will be stewarded by the Zondervan publishing group.
Editions.
The following table outlines the publication history of the King James version of the Thompson Chain-Reference Bible. The changes from one edition to another are generally seen in the margins of the Bible and in the study materials in the back of the Bible, rather than the Biblical text itself. (A “Revised Edition” listed in the table does not refer to a “Revised Version” of the Bible.)
&lt;br&gt;
Chains.
The heart of the Thompson Chain-Reference system is Thompson's "chain topics". The system incorporates over 4,000 such chains. As an example, the entry for Amalek says:
Genesis 36:12 has the following margin note:
The "chain" continues in Exodus 17:8 which has this margin note:
and so on, until 1 Chronicles 4:43 which has the margin note:
indicating the end of the chain. Other chains are more complex. Chain topic 3724, for example, concerns the general topic of unity:
This topic is divided into the major subtopics of "UNITY of Believers", "COOPERATION", and "STRIFE", each of which is divided into further topics. The general section contains 12 individual chains, some of considerable size. Many also incorporate references to chains treated elsewhere, such as the reference to "Saints' Fellowship" (chain 1325). The chain numbers feature prominently in the Thompson system, and the chain topics are listed in numerical order.
Comprehensive Bible assistance.
In addition to the chain topics, the Thompson Chain-Reference Bible includes a number of other aids to Bible study:

Doug Hurley

Douglas Gerald Hurley (born October 21, 1966) is an American engineer, former Marine Corps pilot, and former NASA astronaut. He piloted Space Shuttle missions STS-127 (July 2009) and STS-135 (July 2011), the final flight of the Space Shuttle program. He launched into space for the third time as commander of Crew Dragon Demo-2, the first crewed spaceflight from American soil since STS-135 and became, together with Bob Behnken, the first astronaut in history launching aboard a commercial orbital spacecraft. He was also the first Marine to fly the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet. His call sign is "Chunky", and he was sometimes referred to by this name on the communication loops.
Early years and education.
Hurley was born on October 21, 1966, in Endicott, New York, and spent his childhood in Apalachin, New York. He graduated from the Owego Free Academy in Owego, New York in 1984 and graduated "magna cum laude" with honors from Tulane University, earning his B.S.E. degree in civil engineering in 1988. He was also a distinguished graduate from both Tulane's Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) program and from USMC Officer Candidates School.
Marine Corps career.
Hurley received his commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps from the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps at Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1988. After graduation, he attended The Basic School at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, and later the Infantry Officers Course. Following aviation indoctrination at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, he entered flight training in Texas in 1989; he was a distinguished graduate of the U.S. Navy Pilot Training program and was designated a Naval Aviator in August 1991.
Hurley then reported to VMFAT-101 at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California for initial F/A-18 Hornet training. Upon completion of training, he was assigned to VMFA(AW)-225 where he made three overseas deployments to the Western Pacific. While assigned to VMFA(AW)-225, he attended the United States Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Instructor Course, the Marine Division Tactics Course and the Aviation Safety Officers Course at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Over his four-and-a-half years with the "Vikings", he served as the aviation safety officer and the pilot training officer.
Hurley was then selected to attend the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland and began the course in January 1997. After graduation in December 1997, he was assigned to the Naval Strike Aircraft Test Squadron (VX-23) as an F/A-18 project officer and test pilot. At "Strike", he participated in a variety of flight testing, including flying qualities, ordnance separation and systems testing and became the first Marine pilot to fly the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet. He was serving as the operations officer when selected for the astronaut program. Hurley has logged over 5,500 hours in more than 25 types of aircraft.
NASA career.
Selected as a pilot by NASA in July 2000, Hurley reported for training in August 2000. Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation, he was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office which included Kennedy Operations Support as a "Cape Crusader," where he was the lead ASP (Astronaut Support Personnel) for Space Shuttle missions STS-107 and STS-121. He also worked shuttle landing and rollout, served on the Columbia Reconstruction Team at Kennedy Space Center and in the Exploration Branch in support of the selection of the Orion crew exploration vehicle.
He also served as the NASA Director of Operations at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia.
STS-127.
In July 2009, he was the pilot on STS-127, ISS Assembly Mission 2J/A, which delivered the Japanese-built Exposed Facility (JEM-EF) and the Experiment Logistics Module Exposed Section (ELM-ES) to the International Space Station. The mission duration was 15 days, 16 hours, 45 minutes.
STS-135.
In July 2011, Hurley returned to space on the final shuttle flight, STS-135 on the Space Shuttle "Atlantis". The mission delivered the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Raffaello and a Lightweight Multi-Purpose Carrier (LMC) to the International Space Station and tested a system which investigated the potential of robotically refueling existing spacecraft. STS-135 mission duration was 12 days, 18 hours, 27 minutes and 56 seconds.
After returning to Earth, he served as the Assistant Director, New Programs for the Flight Crew Operations Directorate (FCOD) at Johnson Space Center. In August 2014, he became the Assistant Director for the Commercial Crew Program following the merger of Flight Operations and Mission Operations.
SpaceX-DM2.
In July 2015, NASA announced Hurley as one of the first astronauts for U.S. commercial spaceflights. Subsequently, he started working with Boeing and SpaceX to train in their commercial crew vehicles, along with the other chosen astronauts Sunita Williams, Robert Behnken and Eric Boe. In August 2018, Hurley was assigned to SpaceX-DM2, the first test flight of the SpaceX Crew Dragon. Following the in-flight abort test of Crew Dragon, Hurley was confirmed to be the flight's commander. Hurley and fellow crewmember Bob Behnken were humorously compared in news and social media to the fictional brothers Bob and Doug McKenzie because of their friendship when they participated in the first commercial astronaut launch on SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2.
Crew Dragon successfully launched on May 30, 2020, and successfully docked with the International Space Station on May 31, 2020. The crew joined the ISS Expedition 63 crew, which consisted of NASA astronaut and ISS commander Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Ivan Vagner and Anatoli Ivanishin. Crew Dragon undocked from the International Space Station on August 1, 2020, and successfully returned to Earth on August 2, 2020, after splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Pensacola, Florida.
Retirement from NASA.
On July 16, 2021, NASA announced that Hurley would be retiring from the agency after 21 years of service. In the announcement released on the NASA website, NASA administrator Bill Nelson stated, "Doug Hurley is an exceptional astronaut whose leadership and expertise have been invaluable to NASA's space program. His impact on the agency transcends his impressive work in spaceflight, inspiring us to take on bold endeavors. I extend my deepest gratitude to Doug and wish him success in his next adventure."
Personal life.
Hurley is married to fellow NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg. They have one son and live in League City, Texas.

MKTBT mine

The MKTBT is a large circular bakelite cased Albanian anti-tank blast mine. The mine uses a mechanical pressure fuze, copied from the Russian MV-5. The mine has relatively low metal content, including a metal carrying handle and fixing brackets, as well as six screws in the top of the mine. The mine is normally colored red-brown.
Usage.
The mine was utilized by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The KLA mainly used mines of Yugoslavian origin that were disarmed in Serbia and placed elsewhere, but also used mines acquired from elsewhere such as the MKTBT mine. According to Albanian sources, around 300,000 mines of various types including the MKTBT mine were stolen from military depots in 1997 or bought. Twenty-seven MKTBT mines were used to destroy a bridge on the Mitrovica–Leposavić road on 22 March 2000. The mines were placed under bridge supports in three-mine stacks with a 200-gram TNT detonator on top. The mine may also be present in Albania.

USO Calcio

Unione Sportiva Oratorio Calcio was an Italian association football club representing the Lombardian towns of Calcio, Lombardy.
History.
The foundation.
The club was founded in 1978 as Unione Sportiva Oratorio Calcio, (also known as U.S.O. Calcio) in the town of Calcio.
U.S. Calcio Caravaggese.
In 2007 the club was merged with U.S. Caravaggese, a team of the town of Caravaggio founding U.S. Calcio Caravaggese. From 2007 to 2009 the club has played its home matches at Nuovo Stadio Comunale in the town Caravaggio, which has a capacity of 2,000.
Soon later the club, second-placed in the 2006–07 Serie D group B as "U.S.O. Calcio", was admitted in the Serie C2 for the 2007–08 season to fill a vacancy created by league winners Tempio.
The club was immediately relegated to Serie D. Also in the following season it was again relegated, this time in Eccellenza.
The return to the origins.
In the summer 2009, the executives representatives of the city of Caravaggio after disagreements over the management team, left the company refounding the team of Caravaggio and so "U.S. Calcio Caravaggese" has changed its name returning to the original name of U.S.O. Calcio and in the season 2009–10 it has played in Eccellenza Lombardy group C.
Merger with Rudianese.
In the summer 2010 the club joins forces with A.C.D. Rudianese and A.S.D. Urago D´Oglio founding U.S.O. Calcio Rudianese, but still retains the title of Eccellenza for one year, until the summer 2011 when the merger becomes official.

Adriano Lualdi

Adriano Lualdi (22 March 1885 – 8 January 1971) Italian composer and conductor.
Life and career.
Lualdi was one of those artists in Italy whose reputation was subsequently diminished because of his early and continued avid support of Benito Mussolini and Italian fascism.
He was musically precocious and was sent to Rome where he studied composition with Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari at the Santa Cecilia conservatory. As a young musician, he conducted at La Fenice in Venice, the San Carlo Theater in Naples, as well as heading the conservatories in Florence and Naples. He was a frequent contributor to musical journals and debates and collaborated with Mascagni and Toscanini, who directed Lualdi's composition "Il diavolo nel campanile", based on Edgar Allan Poe's "The Devil in the Belfry."
Lualdi organized the "“900 musicale italiano”" in 1927 in Milan, dedicated to music of the 20th century in Italy, as well as the first "International Festival of Music" in Venice in 1930, an adjunct of the Venice Biennale. In 1929 he was elected to the Italian parliament. He then directed the Naples conservatory for eight years and, later, the Cherubini conservatory in Florence.

Dundas Aqueduct

Dundas Aqueduct () is an aqueduct in England which carries the Kennet and Avon Canal over the River Avon (the Somerset / Wiltshire border) and the Wessex Main Line railway. The aqueduct is near Monkton Combe, Somerset, and is about south-east of the city of Bath.
It was designed by John Rennie and chief engineer John Thomas between 1797 and 1801, and completed in 1805. James McIlquham was appointed contractor. It is named after Charles Dundas, the first chairman of the Kennet and Avon Canal Company. The aqueduct is long with three arches built of Bath Stone, with Doric pilasters, and balustrades at each end. The central semi-circular arch spans ; the two oval side arches span .
The canal crosses back across the Avon and the railway on another aqueduct at Avoncliff. This diversion onto the right bank of the Avon avoids the steep sides of the river valley at Limpley Stoke, and the need to cross the Midford Brook and River Frome.
It is a Grade I listed building, and was the first canal structure to be designated as a scheduled monument in 1951.
Over many years, leaks had developed and the aqueduct was closed in 1954. For a while in the 1960s and 1970s, the canal was dry and it was possible to walk along the bed on each side of the river, as well as through the aqueduct itself. The aqueduct was relined with polythene and concrete and restored, reopening in 1984. Care was taken not to disturb a colony of bats living under the aqueduct.
The aqueduct is also the junction between the Kennet and Avon Canal and the largely derelict Somerset Coal Canal. The short stretch of the Somerset Coal Canal still in water forms Brassknocker Basin, used for boat moorings, cycle hire and a cafe, and is next to Dundas Wharf where the small tollhouse, warehouse and crane still stand. The stretch of river below and above the aqueduct is used by Monkton Combe School Boat Club (Monkton Bluefriars) up to six days a week, since at least the 1960s. At the opposite (Wiltshire) end of the aqueduct a wharf was constructed serving the Conkwell stone quarries.
Between 2002 and 2004, further restoration was undertaken that included replacing engineering bricks, which had been used by the Great Western Railway to make earlier repairs, with Bath Stone to match the original work.
In 2015, the railway below the aqueduct was lowered to allow the route to be used as a diversionary route for freight trains in the future. Network Rail published a time-lapse video of the work.

Bobobobs

Bobobobs ( ) is a series of fictional children's stories created by Henk Zwart and Nerida Zwart. The Bobobobs consists of several illustrated books and comics, and an animation children's television series produced in 1988. The Bobobobs stories were originally published by Standaard Uitgeverij in Belgium, with later animation and merchandising produced by BRB Internacional in Spain.
The Bobobobs animated children's television series is based upon the characters and stories created and written by Henk Zwart and Nerida Zwart. It was directed by Tim Reid and produced by the Spanish company BRB Internacional, who produced other animated shows such as "Around the World with Willy Fog", "Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds" and "The World of David the Gnome" during the 1980s. The television series, consisting of 26 episodes, was subsequently dubbed into English by Cinelume, with the participation of Telefilm Canada as well as being dubbed into Hungarian, Italian, Catalan, Dutch, Afrikaans and German. The English tune, with a length of over two minutes, was composed by Guido &amp; Maurizio de Angelis, while the lyrics were written by Ted Mather and performed by Rita Irasena and Emilio Aragon.
The series is set on the distant past, and depicts nomadic extraterrestrial humanoids which are heading towards planet Earth on a spaceship resembling a galleon.

Ruse blood wedding

The phrase Ruse blood wedding () usually refers to a 1910 conflict among ethnic groups and the army in Ruse, Bulgaria, resulting in the deaths of 24 people; 70 others were injured. The clashes were caused by the wedding of a Bulgarian man and an ethnic Turkish girl, of which the local Turks disapproved and state authorities violently opposed.
Incident.
On 24 February 1910, Yordan Stefanov (Archaic ) and Saafet obtained permission to marry from a doctor, as Saafet was "mentally healthy" and claimed to be 18 years old. Saafet decided to adopt a Slavic name — Ruska (). On the next day, her father, who was a "hodzha" (; a priest), expressed his protest before the mayor, along with other Muslims. According to him and his wife, their daughter was abducted and still was underage (almost 16 years old) for a marriage.
The court revoked the marriage permission on 27 February 1910, and ordered that the girl be returned to her parents, so she returned to their house until the evening. At night, a crowd of "adventurers" gathered in front of Saafet's house with the intention to "steal" her and set her free. The authorities responded by moving the girl to a police station, but could not cope with the approximately 1000 people, and Saafet eventually married Yordan on the 28th. Their wedding was celebrated by many on the central square, as this was the first Sunday before Lent (), and a traditional fancy-dress carnival was held.
The local police officer, who also attended the carnival, was mocked for not being able to keep Saafet in the police station. Half an hour later, he called up support from the cavalry, and after some mutual verbal insults, the citizens and the military started a fight. There were 24 dead and about 70 injured after the clashes. At first, the police attempted to cover up the story by restricting communications to and from Ruse, but it soon became the top news in newspapers all over the country.
Various Bulgarian cities like Varna, Burgas, Ihtiman, a rally was held to protest the state's behavior. An attempt for a rally in Ruse was made but the police did not give permission. The issue continued until 1914, when 21 people were charged, 120 witnesses were heard but all suspects were acquitted.
Political context.
Reactions varied — some blamed the police, while others blamed the government for giving the orders, and claimed that the police only did what it should. The socialist party stated that that was just a "stupid love comedy" which should not have ended as it did.
The wedding posed a difficult problem to Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, who had already planned to have a meeting with Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The relations between Ferdinand and the Sublime Porte were tense after he became a self-declared tsar (former knyaz). The Turkish diplomats in Bulgaria insisted that not returning the girl to her parents would have been an insult to their religion, so that could have been the major factor which influenced the government's orders to guard Saafet "at any cost".
Folklore.
The event is popularly perceived as an example of both ethnic intolerance in a multi-cultural urban society, and the prevalence of emotion over descent.
Several versions of a folk song, inspired by the blood wedding, can be heard in the Ruse, Veliko Tarnovo, and Varna regions. A song from Turkish folklore in those regions is also known to be based on this story.

Dean Coney

Dean Henry Coney (born 18 September 1963) is an English former professional footballer who played as a forward for Fulham, Queens Park Rangers and Norwich City.
A cruciate ligament injury at Norwich ended his professional career, after which he played briefly in Hong Kong before playing non-league football back in England with Farnborough Town and Carshalton Athletic. He went on to manage Farnborough and was most recently assistant manager at Dagenham &amp; Redbridge.
Career.
Coney began his career with Fulham, making his debut at the age of 17. He showed great promise and scored 19 goals in his first full season. He was capped by England under-21s. However, he was unable to maintain his early scoring rate and moved to QPR, who paid £200,000 for him in 1987. He failed to settle at Loftus Road, due partly to the fact that manager Trevor Francis often played him in midfield.
Towards the end of the 1988–89 season, Norwich manager Dave Stringer paid £350,000 for Coney. Norwich were enjoying an excellent season and were in with a chance of winning the first division championship. Stringer felt that Coney would score the extra goals that were needed, though Coney had failed to score in his 16 games that season for QPR. However, his time at Carrow Road was neither happy nor productive for Coney. He scored just one goal, which was a fortuitous one - in a league match against Aston Villa at Carrow Road on 22 April 1989 he charged down a clearance by Villa goalkeeper Nigel Spink and the ball rebounded off Coney's backside and into the goal. His performances became lacklustre and the supporters were very critical of Coney. The transfer fee was, at the time, one of the highest that Norwich had paid for a player, but little return on it was received. He was frequently heckled during matches and at length handed in a transfer request, stating "the fans have it in for me." Coney suffered his cruciate injury in a reserve match before he was able to find another club.
After a brief spell with Hong Kong team Ernest Borel he joined Farnborough where he eventually became player-manager. He moved to Carshalton where a serious knee injury ended his days as a player. He returned to Farnborough as temporary manager in 1999 and then first team coach. He was appointed assistant manager at Redbridge in 2005.

Darcy Blake

Darcy James Blake (born 13 December 1988) is a Welsh former professional footballer. During his career, he won 14 caps for Wales at international level, scoring once, and made more than 100 appearances in the Football League.
He began his career as a youth player with Cardiff City before making his professional debut at the age of 17 in 2006. During the 2009–10 season he spent time on loan with Plymouth Argyle. After returning to Cardiff, he struggled to establish himself in the first team but went on to make over 100 appearances for the club.
In 2012, he joined Crystal Palace for £350,000 but was released by the club after 18 months having made ten appearances. Blake received criticism from a number of former managers, including Dave Jones, Malky Mackay and Chris Coleman, during his career regarding his fitness levels. He later had a brief spell with Newport County before dropping out of the professional game at the age of 25, playing for local amateur teams and briefly converting to rugby.
Early life.
Born in New Tredegar, Blake grew up in Phillipstown. As a teenager, Blake attended Blackwood Comprehensive School and was childhood friends with boxer Nathan Cleverly.
Club career.
Cardiff City.
Blake joined local youth side Jubilee Thistle at the age of nine where he played as a striker. At the age of 10, Blake joined the youth academy at Cardiff City, the club he supported alongside Liverpool, although he continued playing for Thistle until he was 12. After progressing through the club's youth system, he signed his first professional contract at the club in 2006 with a three-year deal, along with fellow academy graduate Chris Gunter. Blake made his professional debut on 17 April 2006 against Crewe Alexandra in the Football League Championship, following injuries to several first team players, replacing Jeff Whitley as a late substitute during a 1–1 draw. The following season, Blake was involved in the first team early, making two appearances in the opening month of the season but made just four further appearances during the first half of the season. On 20 February 2007, Blake made his first league start for the club in a match against West Bromwich Albion; Cardiff lost the match 1–0.
Able to play in several different positions, Blake gained a reputation as being a versatile player having played at centre back, right back, centre midfield and right wing for Cardiff in his first full season, commenting "I'm not sure where my best position is and I really don't mind where I play." Blake began the 2007–08 season in the reserve side but, after a number of injuries affecting the club, he was increasingly involved in first team matches, including coming on as a substitute for Kevin McNaughton during a 2–0 win over Middlesbrough in the FA Cup quarter-final which was followed by his first league start of the season at right back in a 1–1 draw with Colchester United. In total he made 13 appearances during the season, including featuring in three of the club's six matches as they reached the FA Cup final but was left out of the matchday squad for the match.
At the start of the 2008–09 season, Blake was placed on a special training regime by the club to correct his posture in an attempt to remedy long-term injury problems after being substituted in the opening 20 minutes of a League Cup tie against Milton Keynes Dons.
Plymouth Argyle.
On 28 August 2009, Blake signed for fellow Championship club Plymouth Argyle on loan until January 2010, making his debut the following day in a 3–1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. In his fifth appearance for the side, he was sent off for the first time in his professional career during a 1–1 draw with Ipswich Town on 24 October 2009 following a foul on Jonathan Walters. Plymouth appealed the decision but the red card was upheld and he was subsequently suspended for three matches. Blake completed his loan at Plymouth on 31 December 2009 and returned to Cardiff. However, Plymouth manager Paul Mariner stated his desire for Blake to return to the club during the January transfer window. However, the club was placed under a transfer embargo that delayed the move and Blake was able to force his way into the first team at Cardiff again.
Blake has cited his loan spell with Plymouth as a turning point in his career, stating "Looking back, I was immature and needed that loan move away." Prior to his move, Cardiff manager Jones had been critical of Blake's diet and subsequent fitness levels.
Return to Cardiff.
On his return to Cardiff, Blake was immediately involved with the first team where he was named on the bench in an FA Cup third round replay against Bristol City, where he came on to make his first appearance of the season, before making his first start of the season in the fourth round against Leicester City four days later. Injuries to club captain Mark Hudson and Gabor Gyepes allowed Blake to establish himself in the side as a centre-back alongside Anthony Gerrard. He made a career-high 24 appearances and helped the team reach the Championship play-offs before losing 3–2 to Blackpool in the play-off final.
Blake missed Cardiff's 2011–12 pre-season schedule through injury but returned in a 1–1 draw with Burnley on 20 August 2011, coming on as a substitute in place of Joe Mason. He made his 100th appearance for Cardiff against Portsmouth on 27 August, which was also his first league start of the season. Despite being a regular at international level for Wales, Blake struggled to establish himself in the first team at Cardiff, former Wales striker Iwan Roberts to question his future at Cardiff City Stadium. Cardiff manager, Malky Mackay, replied to this saying Blake was "in his plans" but his injuries and fitness were a problem. The newly formed partnership of Mark Hudson and Ben Turner were preferred ahead of Blake, who later confirmed his desire to hold talks with boss Mackay over his future at Cardiff having not featured for the club in over a month. At the end of the season, he played in the 2012 Football League Cup Final, replacing McNaughton in extra time as Cardiff went on to lose to Liverpool in a penalty shootout. On 9 August 2012, Blake rejected new terms at Cardiff, where he only had a year left on his contract following his time as a bit part player the previous season. On 22 August, Blake entered talks with Crystal Palace over a possible move.
Crystal Palace.
With his contract due to expire at the end of the season, Mackay accepted an offer of £350,000 from Crystal Palace in order to avoid Blake leaving on a free transfer the following summer, with the deal being completed on 24 August 2012. Although Blake was reluctant to leave Cardiff, he accepted the move in order to play first team football, stating "My dream has always been to play for the Bluebirds at Premier League level [...] I thought hard about everything before leaving City. But it was time to make a decision."
He made his debut for Palace on 25 August 2012 in a 2–1 defeat to Middlesbrough. After initially featuring in the first team, he was dropped from the side and did not make an appearance for Palace after December 2012. Wales manager Chris Coleman publicly criticised Blake's fitness levels after revealing that he had been deemed too unfit for Palace's reserve side and stated "Darcy has got to be fitter. He has lost his fitness and there is no easy way around it."
He remained with Palace following the club's promotion to the Premier League but made no further appearances and, on 31 January 2014, his contract was terminated by mutual consent after making only 10 league appearances.
Newport County.
On 20 March 2014, Blake joined Newport County on non-contract terms, having spent time training with Birmingham City. His signing was branded a "transfer coup" by County manager Justin Edinburgh and he made his debut for Newport in a League Two match against Torquay United on 22 March. He remained at Newport until the end of the 2013–14 season, making seven appearances. Although he held talks with the club regarding an extension, he was unable to agree a new contract with Edinburgh commenting "I don't think that we could make the offer they were looking for."
Blake went on to train with Plymouth in July 2014, the club he was loaned to in 2009, but left on 28 August 2014 after failing to earn a permanent deal. The following month, he played for local amateur side Tredegar Arms in the North Gwent Football League after the club were short of players due to injuries, scoring a hat-trick while playing as a striker against Pantside. Pantside appealed to the league officials over his inclusion in the match but no action was taken after the league confirmed he was registered to play for the side. He returned to Newport briefly on trial but was not offered a contract although Edinburgh commented "It would be an absolute waste if the boy didn't get back into the pro game." He also played for amateur rugby team New Tredegar's seconds side in Division Two of the Gwent, Newport and Pontypool District League and appeared on an episode of the BBC Wales rugby show "Scrum V" with some of his teammates. In October 2015, he returned to football after being appointed as a player-coach for Aberbargoed Buds.
International career.
Blake was a regular for the Wales under-17 and under-19 squads before he was called up to the under-21 team for the first time in 2006 by coach Brian Flynn and made his debut for the side against Israel. Usually playing at right back, he was part of the team that finished top of their qualifying group for the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship before losing in the playoff match against England.
In May 2008, he received his first call-up, alongside six other uncapped members of the Wales under-21 side, to the Wales team. Blake made his full international debut on 12 October 2010, being named in the starting line-up for a 4–1 defeat to Switzerland in Basel before being replaced by Christian Ribeiro after 54 minutes. He played his second game against Scotland, in the Nations Cup, where Wales lost 3–1. On 10 August 2011, Blake scored his first senior career goal in a 2–1 defeat against Australia and was named in the starting line-up in the side's following match against Montenegro due to James Collins being suspended. Despite being largely a reserve player for Cardiff at the time, he established himself in the side as a centre back under manager Gary Speed, who described Blake as a player that could "shine in the Premier League," and kept his place in the side for the remainder of the Euro 2012 qualifiers, including a 1–0 defeat against England where he received praise for his performance.

Chris Gunter

Christopher Ross Gunter (born 21 July 1989) is a Welsh former professional footballer who played as a defender. An attacking full back, he was capable of playing on both flanks but usually played on his preferred right side. Since 2023, he has been a coach for the Wales national team.
He joined Cardiff City's youth system and was signed by Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for £4 million in January 2008. Rarely used at Tottenham, he returned to the Championship with Nottingham Forest, initially on loan, before joining Reading in 2012. He made 314 appearances for Reading before being released in 2020 and moving to Charlton Athletic and AFC Wimbledon.
Gunter was a Welsh international since under-17 level and holds the record as the second youngest debutant for the under-21 team. He made his full international debut in 2007, earning 109 caps in a 15-year international career. He was part of the Wales squad that reached the semi-finals at UEFA Euro 2016, also featuring at Euro 2020 and in the 2022 World Cup squad. In 2017 he was named Welsh Footballer of the Year. He beat Neville Southall's record of 92 caps in 2018, and in 2021 became the first Welshman to earn 100 caps.
Early life.
Gunter was born in Newport to Gerald and Sarah Gunter. As a youngster, he attended Durham Road Junior School before moving on to St Julian's High School as a teenager. He and his brother Marc support Cardiff City, beginning to follow the club from the age of nine, and he continued to go to away games that did not clash with his own youth team fixtures on supporters' coaches until 2006. Gunter also holds a BTEC National Diploma in Sports Studies.
Club career.
Cardiff City.
Gunter started his career as a striker when he played for local youth sides Durham Colts and Albion Rovers in Newport but switched to playing as a full back at a young age and signed for the Cardiff City youth side at the age of eight. He signed his first professional contract with the club on 1 August 2006 along with fellow Cardiff academy graduate Darcy Blake.
Primarily a right-sided defender, Gunter made his senior debut for Cardiff on 22 August 2006 against Barnet in the League Cup first round, playing the full 90 minutes of a 2–0 loss at Ninian Park. After being included in the first team squad on several occasions, his league debut came in a 1–0 home loss to Queens Park Rangers on 17 November 2006. Gunter was praised for his performance by manager Dave Jones, who commented "Chris did the right things, let nobody down, and will only get stronger." Gunter would later describe his second league appearance, a 4–1 defeat to Hull City, as one of the lowest points of his career. However, he was able to maintain his place in the squad, competing with Kevin McNaughton and Kerrea Gilbert.
In March 2007 he won the Football League's Apprentice of the Year award after impressing in the first team squad due to injuries to some regular players and during the summer of 2007, Gunter was the subject of two bids of £500,000 and £1 million from Premier League club Everton. Both, however, were rejected. At the end of the 2006–07 season, having made sixteen appearances in all competitions, he became Cardiff's youngest player to win a senior international cap after making his debut, beating the 48 year old club record held by Graham Moore.
Tottenham Hotspur.
According to reports on 21 December 2007, Cardiff agreed a substantial fee with Tottenham Hotspur and therefore allowed Gunter to enter into talks with the club. Cardiff also stated that Tottenham had "met their valuation of the player" which had previously been reported at £4 million. On 22 December Gunter passed a medical at White Hart Lane with a view to a £2 million move. The move was made official on 24 December and he joined the club after the transfer window opened on 1 January 2008.
Gunter made his debut for Spurs on 15 January in an FA Cup third round tie against Reading at the Madejski Stadium, playing the entirety of a 1–0 victory. Fifteen days later, he made his top-flight debut for Spurs, playing 62 minutes of a goalless draw at Everton before being replaced by Kevin-Prince Boateng. He made only one more league appearance that season, filling in for Didier Zokora for the final 17 minutes of a 4–1 loss at Birmingham City on 1 March. He was cup-tied for their win in the 2008 Football League Cup Final.
His second season did not see him become a regular, as he featured in only three league matches, playing the full 90 minutes in none of them. On 12 March 2009, Gunter moved on loan to Nottingham Forest for the rest of the 2008–09 season.
Nottingham Forest.
On 17 July 2009, Tottenham Hotspur accepted a bid of £1.75 million from Nottingham Forest. Forest completed the signing of Gunter on 20 July on a four-year contract.
He scored his first goal for the club in a 1–0 victory at Plymouth Argyle on 27 September 2009. It was also Gunter's first goal in senior football. In the match between Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace on 23 March 2010, Gunter made his 100th senior club appearance. In May 2010, he was selected in the Championship PFA Team of the Year for the 2009–10 season.
On 15 August 2010, Gunter and Sanchez Watt were booked by referee Tony Bates for an on-field altercation; however later that month the FA retrospectively gave Gunter a three-match ban when replays showed him stamping on the Leeds United player.
A regular at right-back during his time at Forest, Gunter scored his only other goal for the club on 16 August 2011, the only goal of a match at Doncaster Rovers.
Reading.
Gunter completed a move to Reading on 17 July 2012, signing a three-year deal for the club who had been promoted to the Premier League. The fee was undisclosed but has been reported to have been between £2.3 million and £2.5 million. He scored his first goal for Reading against Peterborough United in the League Cup on 28 August 2012, the 3–2 home victory putting the team into the third round. He played 20 league matches for the Royals, who ended the season relegated. On 29 November 2013, Gunter was sent off as Reading won 3–2 at his former club Forest.
On 27 March 2015, Reading took up the option in Gunter's contract to extend his stay with the Royals for an additional year. In the League Cup first round on 11 August, he scored the extra-time only goal as Reading won away at Colchester United.
On 18 February 2016, Gunter signed a new two-year contract to keep him at Reading until the summer of 2018. Gunter again extended his contract with Reading on 5 July 2017, agreeing a new three-year contract, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2020. In October 2017, Gunter was named Welsh Footballer of the Year by the Football Association of Wales.
In the 2018–19 season, a combination of the arrivals of Andy Yiadom and manager José Manuel Gomes saw Gunter's first-team opportunities limited – the first time since his arrival at the club that he faced prolonged spells out of the side. A combination of these factors, and injury, limited him to 22 league appearances across the season.
After Gomes' departure from Reading on 9 October 2019, Gunter and Garath McCleary were recalled to the first team. Both players had been transfer listed and told they would be leaving the club in the previous summer. It was not until 26 November that he made his first appearance of the season, making his 500th career appearance in club football in 1–0 home defeat to Leeds United – also his 225th league start for Reading. On 1 January 2020, profiting from Yiadom's injury, he made his 300th appearance for Reading in a 2–1 win at Fulham. Gunter was released by Reading in July 2020 at the completion of his contract.
Charlton Athletic.
On 8 October 2020, Gunter joined Charlton Athletic on a two-year deal. He scored his only goal for Charlton in a 2–2 draw against Plymouth Argyle on 26 December 2020.
On 10 May 2022, it was confirmed that Gunter would leave Charlton Athletic when his contract expired.
AFC Wimbledon.
On 4 July 2022, Gunter rejoined his former manager Johnnie Jackson by signing for AFC Wimbledon on a one-year deal. He made his debut in EFL League Two on 30 July in a 2–0 home win over Gillingham. In his fourth game on 16 August he was sent off just before half time at Mansfield Town for grabbing the throat of Stephen Quinn, who had kicked the ball at his face while he was on the ground; the score was 2–2 at the time and the final result was a 5–2 win for the hosts. His three-game ban was rescinded on appeal.
Gunter missed two games in March 2023 due to his new commitment to coaching the Wales national team; the decision was endorsed by Jackson. On 4 May, he announced his retirement after 35 games for AFC Wimbledon, and moved into a full-time coaching role for Wales.
International career.
Youth teams.
Gunter started his Wales career during the 2003–04 season, making four appearances for the Schools' under-15 development squad before moving up to the Welsh Schools under-16 squad and played in a friendly against Republic of Ireland plus three Victory Shield internationals. He then made 11 appearances at Wales under-17 level during 2005–06, including captaining tue side, playing in two rounds of the UEFA Championships as Wales qualified from the opening group to reach the elite stage. His next step was playing for the Wales U19 squad in the Milk Cup.
At age 16 years and 299 days, Gunter became the second youngest player to play for the Wales Under-21 team behind Lewin Nyatanga when he played against Cyprus Under-21 in 2006.
Senior team.
Gunter received his first call up to the senior international side at the age of seventeen for a friendly match against New Zealand at the end of his first season of professional football, describing himself as being "absolutely staggered". He made his debut for Wales in the match on 26 May 2007 at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, featuring for the first half of a 2–2 draw. He was ever present at right back during 2010 World Cup qualifying and was the only player in the squad to have played in all ten matches.
On 8 October 2010, Gunter received a straight red card in added time for a professional foul against Dimitar Rangelov in the 0–1 home loss against Bulgaria in a Euro 2012 qualifying match at the Cardiff City Stadium. Aged 24, he won his 50th cap for Wales in the 1–1 away draw with Belgium in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification on 15 October 2013.
Gunter was part of Wales' UEFA Euro 2016 23-man squad and played every minute of their six games as they reached the semi-finals. He won his 75th cap, aged just 27 years, on 6 October 2016 in a 2–2 away draw against Austria in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying.
He captained the side for the first time for Wales' friendly with Panama on 13 November 2017, in which he equalled his former manager Gary Speed's record of 85 international caps for an outfield player. The following 22 March, Gunter made the record his own when he featured in a 6–0 win over China at the 2018 China Cup. On 20 November 2018, he surpassed Neville Southall's record of 92 caps for Wales in a 1–0 friendly loss away to Albania, in which he was captain for the second time. After the game, Southall tweeted: "Have a great night. Proud it was you who will now hold the record. Congratulations. Top player. Top guy. RESPECT"
Gunter became the first player to attain 100 caps for Wales in the 1–0 friendly win against Mexico on 27 March 2021. In May 2021 he was selected for the Wales squad for the delayed UEFA Euro 2020 tournament.
In November 2022, Gunter was named in the Wales squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, but did not play any of their three Group B games. This allowed Gareth Bale, who started all three games, to overtake Gunter as the most-capped Wales player.
On 9 March 2023, Gunter confirmed he had retired from international football having earned 109 caps.
Coaching career.
On 21 March 2023, Gunter was appointed as one of the coaches to the Wales national football team under team manager Rob Page.
