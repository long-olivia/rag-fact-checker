Rivera, Switzerland

Rivera is a former municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. The municipalities of Medeglia, Bironico, Camignolo, Rivera and Sigirino merged on 21 November 2010 into the new municipality of Monteceneri.
History.
Rivera is first mentioned in 1296 as "Sorenzino". In 1348 it was mentioned as "Rivera".
Archeological objects and graves from the Iron Age and the Roman era have been found in Rivera. In the Middle Ages, Rivera was part of the valley community of Carvina. In the 13th century Como Cathedral possessed estates in Sorencino. Starting in 1678, representatives from the twelve members of the Swiss Confederation in Ticino met in Casa dei landfogti before they assembled in Lugano.
Rivera was a member of the parish of Bironico, before it became an independent parish in 1754. From 1779 until 1793, the parish church of S. Spirito was rebuilt.
The villagers earned their living from agriculture, mostly in alpine meadows and pastures. During construction of the Ceneri tunnel in 1872–82, the population increased sharply. The completion of the road in 1811 and the construction of the tunnel and the station led to the emergence of a new district in the flatter part of the valley. This area forms the northern boundary of the agglomeration of Lugano. The base station of the Monte Tamaro gondola opened in 1972 in Rivera.
Geography.
Rivera has an area, , of . Of this area, or 7.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 76.2% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 10.3% is settled (buildings or roads), or 0.6% is either rivers or lakes and or 5.3% is unproductive land.
Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 3.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 4.5%. Out of the forested land, 64.6% of the total land area is heavily forested and 2.2% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 3.1% is used for growing crops and 3.7% is used for alpine pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water. Of the unproductive areas, 4.6% is unproductive vegetation.
The village is located in the Lugano district, in the upper Vedeggio valley along the old main road. It consists of the village of Rivera and the hamlets of Soresina, Sorencino and Capidogno.
Coat of arms.
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is "Tierced per fess first azure two bendlets wavy argent overall a letter R counterchanged second or coupeaux vert and third gules two tunnel holes sable issuant from base." The coat of arms is fairly recent, being adopted in 1952. The top portion of the coat of arms represents the radio waves from Radio Svizzera Italiana on Monte Ceneri. Monte Ceneri is represented by the middle section. The black arcades represent the tunnels connecting both parts of Ticino, the Sopraceneri and Sottoceneri (over and under the Mount Ceneri).
Demographics.
Rivera has a population () of 1,462. , 20.3% of the population are resident foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years (1997-2007) the population has changed at a rate of 6.4%.

Pantelegraph

The pantelegraph (Italian: "pantelegrafo"; French: "pantélégraphe") was an early form of facsimile machine transmitting over normal telegraph lines developed by Giovanni Caselli, used commercially in the 1860s, that was the first such device to enter practical service. It could transmit handwriting, signatures, or drawings within an area of up to .
Description.
The pantelegraph used a regulating clock with a pendulum which made and broke the current for magnetizing its regulators, and ensured that the transmitter's scanning stylus and the receiver's writing stylus remained in step. To provide a time base, a large pendulum was used weighing , mounted on a frame high. Two messages were written with insulating ink on two fixed metal plates; one plate was scanned as the pendulum moved to the right and the other as the pendulum moved to the left, so that two messages could be transmitted per cycle. The receiving apparatus reproduced the transmitted image by means of paper impregnated with potassium ferricyanide, which darkened when an electric current passed through it from the synchronized stylus. In operation the pantelegraph was relatively slow; a sheet of paper , with about 25 handwritten words, took 108 seconds to transmit.
The most common use of the pantelegraph was for signature verification in banking transactions.
History.
While employed teaching physics at the University of Florence, Giovanni Caselli devoted much time to research into the telegraphic transmission of images. The major problem of the time was to get perfect synchronization between the transmitting and receiving parts so they would work together correctly. Caselli developed an electrochemical technology with a "synchronizing apparatus" (regulating clock) to make the sending and receiving mechanisms work together that was far superior to any technology Bain or Bakewell had.
By 1856, he had made sufficient progress for Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany to take an interest in his work, and the following year he travelled to Paris where he was assisted by the engineer Paul-Gustave Froment, to whom he had been recommended by Léon Foucault, to construct the first pantelegraph. In 1858, Caselli's improved version was demonstrated by French physicist Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel at the French Academy of Sciences in Paris.
On 10 May 1860 Napoleon III visited Froment's workshop to observe a demonstration of the device, and was so enthused by the device that he secured access for Caselli to the telegraph lines he needed to further his work, from Froment's workshops to the Paris Observatory. In November 1860 a telegraph line between Paris and Amiens was allotted to Caselli which enabled a true long-distance experiment, which was a complete success, with the signature of the composer Gioacchino Rossini as the image sent and received, over a distance of . The composer wrote a piece, allegretto ‘del pantelegrafo’, for piano, marking the event.
The first "pantelegram" was sent from Lyon to Paris on 10 February 1862. The Corps législatif later ordered the installation of the pantelegraph on the railway line between the two cities, and from February 1863 the public was able to use it. French law was enacted in 1864 for the pantelegraph facsimile system to be officially accepted. The next year in 1865 the operations started with the Paris to Lyon line and extended to Marseille in 1867.
Russian Tsar Alexander II installed an experimental service between his palaces in Saint Petersburg and Moscow between 1864 and 1865. 
In 1867 the Director of Telegraphs, de Vougy, had a second line set up from Lyon to Marseille; the transmission cost was 20 centimes per square centimetre of image, and the service was operated until 1870.
Surviving machines.
There are few remaining examples of the original pantelegraph. A formidable display of the pantelegraph was mounted in 1961 at the Musée National des Techniques, when a centennial celebration of the device was performed between Paris and Marseille. Again in 1982 their reliability was displayed; at the Postal Museum in Riquewihr, two pantelegraphs were used for six hours a day, for several months, performing without error.
An original specimen is also kept on display at the "Istituto Della Porta" in Naples. 
One pantelegraph is in Munich (German Museum); it was (as of 2007) never displayed.
Another specimen is displayed at the A.S. Popov Central Museum of Communications in St Petersburg, Russia.

Giovanni Caselli

Giovanni Caselli (8 June 1815 – 25 April 1891) was an Italian priest, inventor, and physicist. He studied electricity and magnetism as a child which led to his invention of the pantelegraph (also known as the universal telegraph or all-purpose telegraph), the forerunner of the fax machine. The world's first practical operating facsimile machine ("fax") system put into use was by Caselli. He had worldwide patents on his system. His technology idea was further developed into today's analog television.
Caselli was a student and professor at the University of Florence in Italy. He started a technical journal that explained physics in layman's terms. For his pantelegraph technology he was awarded the Legion of Honor by Napoleon III of France. Parisian scientists and engineers started the Pantelegraph Society to exchange ideas about the pantelegraph and the associated synchronizing apparatus, in order to get the sending and receiving mechanisms to work together properly.
Early life.
Caselli was born in the town of Siena, Italy on 25 April 1815. As a child, he was tutored in Florence by Italian physicist Leopoldo Nobili. These studies involved electrochemistry, electromagnetism, electricity and magnetism. He became a priest in 1836. Caselli became a student at the University of Florence and studied literature, history, science, and religion. He lived in Parma from 1841 to 1848 and was a teacher for the sons of the Marquis of the basilica of San Vitale.
He participated in the insurrection of 1848 for the takeover of Duchy of Parma to be part of Piedmont, and was expelled from the area for his actions during this political violence. He returned to Florence where he became a professor in physics at the University of Florence in 1849. In 1851, he founded the technical journal "La Ricreazione" that explained physics, written in layman's terms, to the public. He studied electricity and magnetism, and he created the pantelegraph between 1855 and 1861, which was the precursor of the fax machine.
Pantelegraph.
"Pantèlègraph" is a portmanteau from pantograph, an instrument that copies handwritten words and sketches, plus "telegraph", an electrical system that sends messages through a normal wire over long distances and that can be mechanically synced. When he was teaching at the University of Florence, Caselli devoted much of his research to the technology of telegraphic transmission of sketches as well as handwritten words. Inventor Alexander Bain was working on this technology with his facsimile machine, as was physicist Frederick Bakewell. The major problem of the time was to get perfect synchronization between the transmitting and receiving parts so they would work together correctly. Caselli developed an electrochemical technology with a "synchronizing apparatus" (regulating clock) to make the sending and receiving mechanisms work together that was far superior to any technology Bain or Bakewell had.
The technique involves an image made using non-conductive ink on a piece of tin foil. A stylus in the electrical path of the tin foil is passed over the foil where it delicately touches it. The stylus passes evenly with scans slightly apart. Then what happens is that electricity conducts where there is no ink contacting the stylus and does not where there is ink in between. This causes spurts of electricity matching the image as it is being scanned. The signals are then sent along a long distance telegraph line. The receiving apparatus at the other end has an electrical stylus and draws blue ink on white paper, reproducing the image line-by-line. The resulting document is a "fac simile" (Latin, "make similar") of the original image scanned.
Caselli made a prototype of his system by 1856 and presented it to Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in a demonstration that used telegraph lines. The Duke was so impressed with Caselli's device that the duke financed Caselli's experiments. When the Duke's enthusiasm waned, Caselli moved to Paris to introduce his invention to Napoleon III. Napoleon immediately became an enthusiastic admirer of the technology. Caselli perfected his pantelegraph (also known as the autotelegraph) between 1857 and 1861 in Paris under the leadership of French inventor and engineer Paul-Gustave Froment. The world's first practical operating facsimile machine ("fax") system put into use was by Caselli and utilized a scanning technology Froment devised. 
In 1858 Caselli's improved version was demonstrated by French physicist Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel at the French Academy of Sciences in Paris. Napoleon saw 1860 a demonstration given of Caselli's pantelegraph and then put in an order for the operation of it within the French telegraph network that started about a year later in the country. Caselli had access to not only the French telegraph lines for his pantelegraph facsimile machine technology, but finances were provided by Napoleon. A test was done successfully then between Paris and Amiens with the signature of composer Gioacchino Rossini as the image sent, and it was received away recognizable. 
Caselli did testing in 1863 between Paris and Marseille, a distance of , which turned out to be successful. French law was enacted in 1864 for it to be officially used on the French telegraph network that was normally used just for telegraph messages. In 1865, operations commenced on a Paris to Lyon line, and this line was extended to Marseille in 1867. Although rudimentary, Caselli had invented the first commercial fax system and the birth of the fax cover sheet. The mid-nineteenth century pantelegraph took about two minutes to transmit a sheet of paper by with 25 handwritten words on it. The early twentieth century modern fax machine took about one minute to transmit a sheet of paper by with 250 handwritten words on it.
Later life and legacy.
Caselli applied in 1861 for a patent for his "pantélégraphe" in Europe and ultimately received European patent number 2,532 for the device. He applied for a patent in 1863 in the United States and it received patent number 37,563. Caselli successfully demonstrated his pantelegraph at the 1861 Florence Exhibition to an audience which had the King of Italy, King Victor Emmanuel. Napoleon visited Caselli at his workshop in 1860 to see a demonstration on how the machine worked. Napoleon was impressed on how well Caselli's apparatus worked and granted him permission to use the French telegraph lines for trials to develop out the machine further. In 1861, Caselli officially registered his invention as a patent. It was in full-scale operation by 1865 between Paris and Lyon. Because of the communication service the pantelegraph did Caselli was hailed as a hero for coming up with the technology and Napoleon bestowed the Legion of Honor upon him.
England had an experimental line in 1863 between the cities of London and Liverpool for a four-month period to test the operation of the device. The French State Legislature Council in 1867 authorized an electrical line between Paris and the town of Marseille to be permanently installed to run a pantelegraph. Napoleon bought Caselli's pantelegraph as a public service and put it into place for the transmission of images from Paris to Lyon. It was in place until Napoleon's defeat in the Battle of Sedan (1870).
Russian Tsar Alexander II put an experimental service in place between his palaces in Saint Petersburg and Moscow between 1861 and 1865. In the first year of operation of the pantelegraph, the system transmitted almost 5,000 faxes, with a peak of faxes being sent at the rate of 110 per hour. In spite of all this, the technology developed too slowly to make it fully reliable. Caselli ultimately gave up on his invention and moved from Paris back to Florence, where he died in 1891. The majority of Caselli's patents, letters, and proofs of teleautographic transmissions are nowadays kept at the municipal library of Siena in Tuscany, Italy, and some can be found in the archives of the Museo Galileo in Florence.
Caselli's scanning technology became popular again in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. English physicist and inventor Shelford Bidwell constructed the phototelegraph in 1881 that scanned and transmitted images using selenium photocells. German physicist Arthur Korn in the early 1900s developed a practical mechanical television system, known as the "Bildtelegraph", that transmitted photographs and fingerprints of criminals. In the early 1900s, French photographer and engineer Édouard Belin invented a phototelegraphic apparatus called the "Bélinographe" ("télestéréographe"), which was a system for receiving photographs over telephone wires and was used by newspapers. His system was used beginning in 1928 by French radio stations to broadcast scanned photographs over airwaves. In 1923, Richard H. Ranger, engineer of Radio Corporation of America, invented the wireless photoradiogram radio facsimile that was able to scan and send images of pictures and signed documents across the Atlantic Ocean, between England and the United States. Herbert E. Ives, television engineer of AT&amp;T, designed a system in 1927 that transmitted live scanned images of a person's face using electronic "electric eyes" mounted in a cabinet. This was a forerunner of the movable studio television camera and the hand-held camcorder.

River Eea

The River Eea () is a small river in the Lake District, Cumbria, England running through the Furness region, which until 1974 was part of Lancashire. It is a relatively short system that arises from numerous small becks and streams throughout the Cartmel Valley. Its course is approximately 10 km long and its mouth is on Sand Gate marshes near Flookburgh, between Barrow and Kendal. It principally flows in a south-westerly direction.
Geography.
The river's source is a spring in the hills, meaning it flows all year round. Its upper course is called Whitestone Beck. The river's main tributaries are Muddypool and Ayside Beck, which converge above Cartmel.
The river rises near High Cark in Newton Fell and the Whitestone Enclosure, and is soon fed by "Black Beck" (emanating from Fair Rigg south of Staveley-in-Cartmel) and "Ayside Pool" (rising above Ayside).
From there, the River Eea runs past Green Bank and through Cartmel and Cark before flowing via Sand Gate Marsh into the estuary of the River Leven at Lenibrick Point, close to Chapel Island. The section above Cark has been re-routed to serve as a water supply to Cark Mill, and there is a branch serving a farm near the railway station. The original use was to drive a water wheel at the cotton mill, but about 1800 a steam engine was added to pump water back up to the upper leat to redouble the supply. The Engine Inn in Cark was named from this local detail. The river is now used as a fieldwork study point for the Castle Head Field Studies Centre where students can measure variables of the river such as the stream velocity, width, depth, turbidity, pebble roundedness, sinuosity etc.
The name may be derived from plenty of eels gathering in its lower course during high tides ("eea" was a Viking word for eel), or from the Old Cumbrian "ia" (ice), or the Old English "ēa" (a river).
Geology.
To the west of the catchment area the rock is mainly slate, but to the east there are deposits of limestone. Sinkholes in the limestone can cause the river to disappear for some time.
Fishing.
The river is stocked with brown trout, but wild brown and sea trout are also found and fished from the river.

Scottish mafia

The Scottish mafia, Scottish Labour mafia, tartan mafia, Scottish Raj, or Caledonian mafia is a term used in the politics of England from the mid-1960s, although fell out of use after the initial collapse in the number of Scottish Labour MPs at the 2015 general election, but due to the resurgence in the number of Scottish Labour MPs at the 2024 general election, the term is expected to make a political revival.
Political use.
The term is used in politics to pejoratively refer to a group of Scottish Labour Party politicians and broadcasters who are believed to have undue influence over the governance of England, such as the constitutional arrangement allowing Scottish MPs to vote on English matters, but, by convention, not the other way around. The term is occasionally used in the UK press and in parliamentary debates.
Since the mid-1960s, the Conservatives have suffered from declining popularity amongst Scottish voters. In the 1999 Scottish Parliament election, the Conservatives won only 18 of 129 seats. That number has stayed relatively steady, with the party winning only 15 seats in the most recent election, making it the third largest party in Scottish politics after the Scottish National Party and Labour. In UK general elections, the Conservatives have gone from a high point of being the only party to carry both a majority of votes and seats in Scotland in 1955 to a complete wipeout, winning no seats in 1997 though in 2001 there had been a single Conservative MP in Scotland, until 12 were elected in 2017.
With Labour being the sole unionist party with broad support in Scotland, the ranks of Scots among Labour politicians have over a period of four or five decades become significant. Thus, the ranks of the so-called Scottish mafia supplied the last two Labour prime ministers, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, as well as their predecessor as head of the Labour party, John Smith.
The influential position of Scots in the Labour Party is part of the plot of the television comedy "The Thick of It", in which the character of the prime minister's director of communications (or, as he is referred to by other characters, the "enforcer"), Malcolm Tucker, is portrayed as an aggressive, foul-mouthed Scotsman. Many of the members of Tucker's staff, such as his deputy, Jamie MacDonald, are also belligerent Scotsmen.
In January 2024, with Labour likely to return to power at the 2024 general election, combined with the SNP's decline in the polls in Scotland. Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland Ian Murray, claimed that Scottish Labour MPs will run Westminster after the election and would be "a major percentage" in an administration led by Keir Starmer which would give them "massive influence". A month later at the Scottish Labour Conference in Glasgow. The Leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Anas Sarwar, in his conference speech claimed that he want to send a government where they send Scottish Labour MPs who will "sit in government round the table and help make decisions." Such comments could lead to the political revival of the term.
Cabinet Ministers.
The so-called Scottish mafia consists of two generations, the first generation are those who were MPs prior to the collapse of Scottish Labour at the 2015 general election and served under the 1997–2010 Labour Government, the second generation are mostly those who are elected as MPs at the 2024 general election in the Scottish Labour revival. Scots who were first elected as Labour MPs including those in non-Scottish constituencies during the intermediate period also became part of the second generation.
Other uses.
The term has also been applied to the group of Scottish footballers who won several domestic and European honours in the 1960s and 70s while playing for the English first division club Leeds United; namely goalkeeper David Harvey (1965–1980, 1982–1984), defender Gordon McQueen (1972–1978), midfielder Billy Bremner (1959–1976)), left winger Eddie Gray (1965–1983), right winger Peter Lorimer (1963–1979, 1983–1986) and striker Joe Jordan (1970–1978).
In the city of Dunedin New Zealand the "Tartan Mafia" is used to describe the group of aging businessmen who are purported to run the city from behind the scenes. The business community do not disown this usage.

History.
Muzzano is first mentioned in 1189 as "Muciano". Agnuzzo was the center of a large manor farm, which was given in 819 by Emperor Louis the Pious to the clergy of Como.

Mallee Football League (South Australia)

The Mallee Football League (MFL) was an Australian rules football competition in South Australia. The league comprised teams located in south eastern South Australia and one team (Murrayville) located in western Victoria.
The football season started after Easter and ended in early September. The local newspaper "The Border Times" had extensive coverage of each week's results of the MFL. Coverage was also provided on WIN SA and Flow FM during the season. During the Queens Holiday Weekend, the MFL selected a team to represent the Mallee against the Riverland. The league's Best &amp; Fairest award was called the "Mail Medal". Prominent players to play at a higher level include Nathan D. Brown (Melbourne FC, Australian Football League), Trent Sporn (Carlton FC), Martin Mattner (Adelaide FC) and Rodney Maynard (Adelaide FC, AFL). The league was within the West Adelaide Football Club's regional recruiting zone.
Final season clubs.
Border Downs/Tintinara Crows.
Located in Tintinara and Coonalpyn, the Crows were in the MFL between 2001 and 2022. BDT FC was formed after the Border Downs and the Tintinara clubs merged. BDT were one of only two teams in the league to not be on the Mallee Highway, with the other being Karoonda.
Prior to their amalgamation in 1993 Border Downs had competed in the River Murray Football League since 1955, while Tintinara had been a member of the Tatiara Football League for the same length of time. Before joining the TFL Tintinara had enjoyed premiership success on three occasions in the Lakes District Football Association. The club later added a solitary TFL flag in 1977. Border Downs’ record was undistinguished as the club’s senior grade team never once made it as far as a grand final. Following the merger the Crows spent seven seasons competing in the RMFL before crossing to the South Australian version of the Mallee Football League. Since joining the MFL the club has been successful across all levels winning more premierships than any other club since the turn of the century.
Border Downs Tintinara are considered to be one of the most successful teams in South Australian Country football, winning 5 premierships in a row from 2010–14. Then adding to their total again in 2016.
Border Downs Tintinara played their final season in the MFL in 2022 after agreeing to merge with Meningie to form the Coorong Cats Football Club and play in the River Murray Football League in 2023.
Karoonda Magpies.
Football started in Karoonda in the year 1914, two years after the town was settled. The first team was called Karoonda Football Club. In 1977 Borrika Football club (situated 16 km east of Karoonda) merged with Karoonda Football Club to be called Karoonda Borrika Football Club. In 1994 United (situated 12 km south of Karoonda) and Wynarka (situated 15 km west of Karoonda) Football Clubs merged with Karoonda Borrika Football Club to form Karoonda Districts Football Club. On 10 June 2005 Karoonda was hit by a freak tornado which semi demolished the clubrooms. With support from the local council and many community and regional people and businesses the club rebuilt and improved the clubrooms to the excellent standard they are now, after spending the 2005 and 2006 seasons in portable rooms behind the western goals. Karoonda agreed to merge with Peake &amp; Districts to join the River Murray Football League in 2023.
Lameroo Hawks.
Based in Lameroo, 200 kilometres east of Adelaide. Lameroo football club is the home of former Adelaide Crows player Rodney Maynard, who still plays an active part in the club.
Murrayville Bulldogs.
Based in Murrayville in Victoria, the Bulldogs are the only Victorian team in an otherwise South Australian league. The club's colours were red, white and blue. 
Prior to 1994 the club competed in various different competitions, with its most notable achievements coming during its stint in the Lameroo and Districts Football League. Between 1979 and 1993 the Bulldogs qualified for the ultimate match of the season on no fewer than nine occasions, emerging victorious against Ngallo in 1980, and Lameroo North the following year as well as three seasons straight between 1984 and 1986. Since joining the MFL in 1994 Murrayville have generally been a mid-table team, however they had a great run of results between 2001–07, winning two of the five Grand Finals they played in.
Sadly in recent years junior numbers have dwindled with some of its under age teams not being able to compete due to low numbers in some years. This has seen a number of former Murrayville juniors move to neighbouring football clubs in Pinnaroo and Ouyen United (formerly Underbool-Walpeup).
Murrayville agreed to join the Murray Valley Football League in 2023.
Peake Lions.
The Peake &amp; District Football club is based in Peake and include the surrounding towns of Geranium, Jabuk, Parrakie and Peake. The Club's colours are red, blue and yellow.
The Peake Oval is most famous for being on a gradual downhill slant, which has created many mixed strategies to play effective football.
Peake &amp; District agreed to merge with Karoonda to join the River Murray Football League in 2023.
Pinnaroo Supa Roos.
Based in Pinnaroo, South Australia, the Pinnaroo Football Club plays its home games at the Pinnaroo Showgrounds. The Club has four teams in the Mallee Football League: "A" Grade, Reserves ("B" Grade), Senior Colts (Under 16's), and the Junior Colts (Under 13's). The colours of the Pinnaroo Supa Roos are red, white and black.
The original Pinnaroo Football Club was established in 1908 and had won a total of half a dozen premierships by the time it split into two separate teams, North Pinnaroo and South Pinnaroo, in 1925. In 1944 these two teams amalgamated and the resultant club, known as Pinnaroo, won premierships both that year and in 1946 before splitting in two again in 1947. This is how things remained until 1974 when North and South joined forces once more, giving birth to today’s Pinnaroo Supa Roos. Between 1974 and 1993 Pinnaroo was affiliated with the Lameroo and Districts Football League. The seniors won a premiership in their very first season, but thereafter the closest they got was runners-up in 1975, 1990 and 1993. Since commencing in the Mallee Football League in 1994 the Supa Roos have had mixed results across all levels, being one of the few teams in the league relying almost entirely on local players rather buying in players from other regions and Adelaide.
The Pinnaroo Football Club shared the Pinnaroo Showgrounds with the Ngallo Demons Football Club in its final years until it went into recess in 2000. Ngallo's presence is still seen with the visitors rooms and interchanges bench in the navy and blue of the Demons. In 2007 the Pinnaroo Showgrounds suffered great damage after a mini-tornado hit the historic show pavilion and grandstand, fortunately after its demolition a smaller pavilion was built in its place at the same time the clubrooms received a significant upgrade. Pinnaroo won the Mallee Football League's final A Grade premiership in 2022, breaking a 21 year drought.
Brief history.
The Mallee Football League was formed in 1994 when the Lameroo &amp; Districts Football League and the Murraylands Football League amalgamated.
There were 7 clubs involved with Karoonda Districts, Lameroo, Murrayville, Ngallo, Parilla / Geranium, Peake &amp; District and Pinnaroo.
Parilla / Geranium went into recess in 1998 and Ngallo followed in 2001. Border Downs Tintinara joined the Mallee League in 2002, winning 12 A grade premierships.
After the majority of clubs agreed to move to neighbouring leagues, the Mallee Football League folded at the conclusion of the 2022 season.
Season format.
The Mallee Football League's season usually starts shortly after Easter. The season usually consists of 15 Rounds of three games, always on Saturdays (each team plays every other team three times) and two breaks during the season for the Queens Birthday weekend and the other for the SA Country Carnival. Recently the MFL introduced one night game a year, usually at Murrayville. The finals series is based on a top four system: The top two play each other and the winner goes through to the Grand Final, the loser plays the winner of the match between the 3rd and 4th placed team. then the winner of that game goes through to the grand final. the winner of the Grand Final is declared the premiers.

Dolgarrog

Dolgarrog is a village and community in Conwy County Borough, in Wales, situated between Llanrwst and Conwy, very close to the Conwy River. The village is well known for its industrial history since the 18th century and the 1925 Eigiau dam disaster. The population was 414 at the 2001 Census, increasing to 446 at the 2011 Census. The community extends up to, and includes part of, Llyn Cowlyd in the Carneddau.
The village is served by Dolgarrog railway station, a halt on the other side of the river Conwy, The bridge allowing access to the station was slated for closure in 2021 due to it being structurally unsafe, but reopened after repairs in 2023.
Surf Snowdonia, the world's first commercial artificial surfing lake, operated in Dolgarrog on the site of the old aluminium factory between 2015 and 2023.
Across the valley is the crag of Cadair Ifan Goch.
Etymology.
The name Dolgarrog derives from Welsh dôl (water-meadow) and carrog (torrent) and reflects the fact that a number of streams descend steeply to the flatter ground beside the river Conwy in this locality. Earlier forms are of the form 'Dole y Garrog' with an intervening 'y (the).
The Legend of Y Garrog.
In a folk etymology, Dolgarrog is said to have got its name from a flying dragon called Y Garrog. This mythical beast preyed on livestock and Dolgarrog (The Garrog's meadow) was the favourite meadow on which it swooped down from the heights to carry off sheep. So serious were the losses that the farmers went on a hunt armed with bows, arrows and spears. One farmer, Nico Ifan, refused to go, claiming a dream had forewarned him that the Garrog would cause his death. His fellow farmers laid a poisoned sheep's carcass on the heights above Eglwysbach across the river. The unsuspecting Garrog seized the bait, was caught and beaten to death. Nico Ifan then came along to gloat over the dead dragon and cursed and kicked the corpse, whereupon the poisoned barbed wing of the Garrog pierced his leg – thus fulfilling the death warning in his dream.
History.
It is believed to have been established around 1200 AD.
The Black Death.
In the 1350s the Black Death took a heavy toll in the lower Conwy Valley, particularly among the bond tenants regulated by the King's officers from Aberconwy, Edward I's new English borough. Their visits and contacts in effect spread the disease. Some townships of villeins, or crown tenants, such as Dolgarrog, were swept away. People left their lands or hid, unable to pay the taxes on their holdings.
The Gunpowder Plot.
A man privy to Guy Fawkes' Gunpowder Plot is said to have lived in the house Ardda'r Myneich (Monks Hill), whose ruins lie in the fields above the road between Porthllwyd and Dolgarrog bridges. Dr Thomas Williams (1550–1622), rector of St Peter's Church, Llanbedr-y-Cennin, was charged with having papist sympathies. He had warned Sir John Wynn of Gwydir to stay away from the Houses of Parliament on that fateful day.
Industry.
Dolgarrog's industrialisation began in the 18th century with a flour mill on the Porth Llwyd river to crush corn for local farmers. There was also a woollen mill at Dolgarrog bridge and the Abbey mill.
The successful Porthllwyd mill was expanded by John Lloyd, son of founder Richard Lloyd. As well as grinding flour, he bought machines to make paper and flock for bedding. Paper from Porthllwyd supplied local printers, including John Jones, printer of Trefriw and later Llanrwst.
In 1885 the villagers wanted to start a school at Porthllwyd. The old village of Dolgarrog appealed to Mr Robins, the then proprietor of the paper-mill. He let them turn a large empty room at the mill into a flourishing Sunday School, known locally as Ystafell y drws goch ("the room with the red door") to make sure the children did not wander into the mill workings.
The Dolgarrog sawmill of John Williams also flourished. It exported hundreds of tons of wooden railway sleepers for the new railways between 1845 and 1865. When the first sod was cut for the Conway and Llanrwst Railway track on 25 August 1860, on Lord Newborough's land at Abbey, Dolgarrog, it was John Williams who supplied the sleepers.
The aluminium works.
The aluminium works (or "smelter") was originally planned in 1895. Water from reservoirs in the Snowdonia Mountains would provide the hydro-electricity needed to run the mill.
In 1907 aluminium reduction ("aluminium smelting") began in the factory utilising electricity from the distant Cwm Dyli power station, and in 1916 a rolling mill was added. In 1924 a hydro-electric plant was built next to the aluminium works to assist in the running of the mill.
During the Second World War the aluminium works were under the control of the Ministry of Aircraft Production and provided parts for aircraft. There was an anti-aircraft unit stationed there, local houses painted green and pill boxes constructed. It is rumoured that the Luftwaffe tried to destroy the works, but the bomber that was sent was shot down, crash-landing in the mountains above the village.
Under the management of Henry Joseph Jack, the Aluminium Corporation of Dolgarrog acquired a controlling interest in the North Wales Power &amp; Traction Company in 1918. This company had been established by Act of Parliament in 1904, taking over the powers awarded to the Portmadoc, Beddgelert &amp; South Snowdon Railway to build a hydro-electric power station in Nant Gwynant for railway purposes, as well as a 2 ft gauge electric railway serving the places named in the 1901 Portmadoc, Beddgelert &amp; South Snowdon Railway Act.
With the vision expanding to supply power to north Wales industries, the railway company was divested of its power-generating powers by another 1904 Act but remained under control of the power company; one of its assets was the 2 ft gauge horse-worked Croesor Tramway. Working with Evan Robert Davies – a Pwllheli solicitor and friend of politician David Lloyd George – and Dundee distiller Sir John Henderson Stewart Bt, Jack was a key player in the development of the Welsh Highland Railway, taking over the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways, reconstructing part of the Croesor Tramway for steam working, linking them with a new railway around Beddgelert and connecting the whole to the Festiniog Railway at Portmadoc. The trio also acquired control of the Festiniog Railway Company and the Snowdon Mountain Tramroad &amp; Hotels Company, running them all from Dolgarrog for a time.
Aluminium reduction ceased in 1944, following a review by the Ministry of Aircraft Production of 1943 which showed that aluminium ingot produced at Dolgarrog cost over £300 per ton compared with Canadian imports at £110 per ton. Production thereafter concentrated upon re-melted, rolled and specialist goods including patterned sheet, cookware and advanced alloys. Alcoa bought out the company Luxfer in 2000 and announced its closure in June 2002. Dolgarrog Aluminium Ltd was formed in 2002 and acquired the assets from Alcoa that year. The factory closed in late 2007 and was demolished in 2009. An artificial wave pool, Surf Snowdonia, operated on the site between August 2015 and September 2023.
'Garden City'.
Prior to the construction of the Aluminium works, Dolgarrog had little in the way of a population. Much of the housing seen today along the main street in Dolgarrog was built by the Aluminium Corporation. In May 1908 the "Welsh Coast Pioneer and Review" reported their intentions:
A limited number of houses were subsequently built, and the Company did also build a hotel and a church. The Works also prompted more housebuilding in neighbouring villages; three managers, for instance, lived in Trefriw.
1925 dam disaster.
On 2 November 1925 the failure of two dams caused a flood that swamped the village of Dolgarrog, killing 16 people. The disaster was started by the failure of the Eigiau Dam, a gravity dam owned by the Aluminium Corporation. The water released from the reservoir flooded downstream, and overtopped the Coedty Dam, an embankment dam. This dam also subsequently failed, releasing the huge volume of water that flooded Dolgarrog. Many more villagers could have been killed had they not been in the local theatre watching a film that night.
The disaster at Dolgarrog led Parliament to pass the Reservoirs (Safety Provisions) Act 1930, which introduced laws on the safety of reservoirs. This has since been updated, and the current law is the Reservoirs Act 1975.
In 2004 a £60,000 memorial trail was created, explaining the tragic story to walkers. The trail takes visitors to where the boulders from the damaged dam reside. The project was opened by the last survivor of the dam disaster, Fred Brown, who on that night lost his mother and his younger sister.
The construction of Eigiau dam had been facilitated by the construction of the Eigiau Tramway, which largely followed the route of the Cedryn Quarry Tramway from Dolgarrog. The incline was upgraded (and the lower section re-aligned), enabling steam engines to reach the starting point of the tramway, near Coedty reservoir. The tramway was built to standard gauge, but was subsequently relaid in narrow gauge (from about 1916) when the Cowlyd Tramway was begun. This latter tramway branched off from the Eigiau tramway at the top of the Dolgarrog incline.
The line of the railway incline has today been replaced by a second pipeline, and the adjoining hillsides are wooded. However, there is a public footpath which ascends the hillside to the left of the pipeline, and in places the timberwork can still be seen. Today the pipeline in the left (when viewed from Dolgarrog) carries water from Llyn Cowlyd, the pipeline on the right carries water from Coedty reservoir.
To the south of the Health Centre the remains of a lower incline (the old route of the Cedryn Tramway) can still be seen. This incline, which joined the upper section a little above the village, passed through a short tunnel under the road at Tyddyn Isaf, visible from the main road. From here the original quarry tramway continued across the marshland to the edge of the River Conwy at Porth Llwyd wharf.
Coed Dolgarrog National Nature Reserve.
The Coed Dolgarrog National Nature Reserve is a wooded area consisting of Beech and Alder woodland which is rare in North Wales. The Beech area allows many different fungi to grow during the autumn.
Education.
"Ysgol Gynradd Dyffryn yr Enfys" provides Welsh-medium primary education to the village and the surrounding area. As of 2024, there were 107 pupils enrolled at the school. 32.9 per cent of statutory school age pupils come from Welsh-speaking homes.
In terms of secondary education, the village is in the catchment area of "Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy".
The Lord Newborough.
Built during the 1800s, the building in later years became a local pub for the villagers of Dolgarrog for many years. In the mid-1990s it became the only restaurant in the village, mostly serving traditional Welsh food, sourced locally from the Conwy Valley. The pub closed for business in September 2010, and is now a private dwelling.

The Pierre Pflimlin Bridge () is a long motorway cantilever bridge over the river Rhine, with a main span measuring . It connects Germany and France, at Kehl and Strasbourg. It is named after Pierre Pflimlin, a former French prime minister, and was opened in 2002. It was funded by France, Germany and the European Union.
Construction.
Planned for several decades, it was built during the late 1990s and early 2000s by the construction companies Bilfinger Berger and Max Früh.
The funding for its construction was provided 55.5% by France, 38.6% by Germany and 5.9% by the European Union.
Function.
The bridge's main purpose is to reduce pressure on the only other Rhine bridge in the vicinity, the Europe bridge ( or ), also located at Strasbourg-Kehl, to the north. The Pierre Pflimlin Bridge links the motorway Lauterbourg–Strasbourg–Saint-Louis–Basle from France to the A5 Hamburg–Frankfurt–Basel motorway in Germany.
It has two lanes to carry cars and other motor vehicles and two lanes reserved for pedestrian and cycle traffic.
Due to the Schengen Agreement, there are no border controls on the bridge, despite it spanning the French–German border.

Kalahari Craton

The Kalahari Craton is a craton, an old and stable part of the continental lithosphere, that occupies large portions of South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe. It consists of two cratons separated by the Limpopo Belt: the larger Kaapvaal Craton to the south and the smaller Zimbabwe Craton to the north. The Namaqua Belt is the southern margin of the Kaapvaal Craton.
Parts of the Kalahari Craton are now in East Antarctica (the Grunehogna Craton) and West Antarctica (Haag Nunataks) and the Falkland Islands.
The name was introduced by .
Formation.
Following a terminology introduced in 2008, the Archaean-Palaeoproterozoic core of the craton is called the Proto-Kalahari Craton. This core plus accreted Mesoproterozoic crust and dispersed non-African fragments compose the Kalahari Craton. Before the Pan-African Orogeny, the Kalahari Craton was much larger than it is today, but its sutures and therefore its extent are difficult to locate due to later overprinting.
The Kaapvaal Craton, Zimbabwe Craton, and Limpopo Belt are made of Archaean terranes and contain crust at least 3.2  and are underlain by a thick () layer of buoyant mantle that is producing garnets and diamonds.
During the Palaeoproterozoic the northwest margin of the Archaean core grew by accretion and had formed a Proto-Kalahari Craton by 1.75 Ga.
During the period 1.4–1.0 Ga subduction occurred along the northwest margin followed by continental collisions along the eastern and southern margins. By this time enough Mesoproterozoic crust had accreted to transform the Kalahari Craton. At 1.11 Ga, during the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia, the Kalahari Craton was affected by the Umkondo-Borg Large Igneous Province.
At 1.15–.98 Ga the Kalahari Craton collided with the eastern margin of Laurentia.

Milka Duno

Milka Duno (born April 22, 1972) is a Venezuelan former race car driver who competed in the IndyCar Series and ARCA Racing Series. She is best known for holding the record of highest finish for a female driver in the 24 Hours of Daytona. She entered the NASCAR Nationwide Series in 2014.
Her racing career is unusual because of her late start. She was introduced to the sport when she was invited to a driving clinic by a car club in Venezuela and did not start racing until she was 24. Prior to racing, her background was primarily academic. Duno holds master's degrees in organizational development, naval architecture, maritime business, and marine biology, and she has prior experience working as a naval engineer.
Biography.
Racing career.
Duno began her career as a driver in Venezuela in 1996, finishing 2nd in the Venezuelan GT Championship. In 1998, she placed fourth in the Venezuelan Porsche Supercup Championship. In 1999, she moved to the United States, attended advanced racing schools, and drove in the Barber Dodge Pro Series in 2000. Duno was the first woman in history to win a Ferrari Challenge Race in the USA; at that time she also won her first Series Championship, The Panoz GT Series.
Later in 2000, Duno made her American Le Mans Series debut; she was the first woman to finish in a class podium on this championship. She made her 24 Hours of Daytona debut the next year and her 24 Hours of Le Mans debut a year later. In 2001 and 2003, Duno also competed in the World Series by Nissan open-wheel series in Europe; she became the first woman to score points in this championship. Also in 2001, she was crowned Vice-Champion Driver in the LMP 675 Class of the American Le Mans Series. She scored an impressive four wins in this class, including the prestigious 10 hours Petit Le Mans, becoming the first woman to score a class win in this major international sportscar competition. In 2004 she scored yet another LMP 675 class win in Petit Le Mans.
Beginning in 2004, Duno competed full-time in the Rolex Grand-Am series driving a Pontiac-Riley Daytona Prototype for the Howard-Boss Motorsports team. Duno joined the SAMAX Motorsport team in 2006. For the 2007 24 Hours of Daytona, Duno teamed up with Ryan Dalziel, Darren Manning, and her regular driving partner, Patrick Carpentier; with a second-place finish, Duno became the highest-finishing female in the history of the prestigious race and highest placing Venezuelan driver, eclipsing Ernesto Soto's 5th-place finish in 1982. In the Rolex Sports Car Series Duno scored three impressive and historical overall wins – twice at Homestead-Miami Speedway and once at Le Circuit Mont-Tremblant in Quebec: With her first Rolex Series won at Miami she became the first woman in history to win overall a major international sports car race in North America, Duno was also the first woman to pilot the fastest car in the series – the Daytona Prototype. During her time competing in the Rolex Series Duno earned three overall wins, seven podium appearances, ten top-five finishes, and eighteen top-ten finishes.
Indy Racing League.
2007.
On March 23, 2007, Duno and her Grand Am Series team, SAMAX Motorsport, sponsored by CITGO, announced that they acquired the equipment to run a 10 race IndyCar series schedule in 2007, including the Indianapolis 500. It was also announced that Duno would no longer run a full schedule in the Grand Am series.
On April 26, 2007, Duno successfully passed her IRL rookie test at Kansas Speedway. When Duno made the field for the Kansas Lottery Indy 300 (also held at Kansas Speedway) on April 29, 2007, it marked the first time in North American open wheel history that three women (Duno, Danica Patrick and Sarah Fisher) ran in the same race. Duno stayed out of trouble after qualifying last in the 21-car field and finished 14th.
On May 6, 2007, Duno successfully completed her rookie test for the Indianapolis 500 race. This 91st running of the "Indy 500" was the first where three women were included in the 33-car field. Duno qualified on May 19, and her speed held through Bump Day. Duno was one of two rookie drivers competing in the Race. She crashed out of the race on lap 65 and finished 31st.
2008.
SAMAX chose not to return to the IndyCar Series in 2008. Duno signed with Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing for another partial season schedule (11 races) also sponsored by Citgo. While practicing and racing alongside veteran teammate and former Indy 500 winner Buddy Rice, throughout the season, Duno began to show a bit of improvement. Townsend Bell was signed as the driver of the Dreyer &amp; Reinbold #23 during the seven races Milka was not scheduled to drive it.
Milka qualified for her second Indianapolis 500 on the second weekend (due to the second day of qualifications being rained out) and finished 19th. She was the highest finishing female, as Danica Patrick and Sarah Fisher placed 22nd and 24th, respectively. Although all three women were involved in accidents during the race, Duno was able to reenter the race after her car was moved to the pits, thus making her the only woman running at the end.
2009.
Duno returned to Dreyer &amp; Reinbold for the 2009 season driving another part–time schedule (9 races) after driving in the Indy Racing League's pre–season open test at Homestead-Miami Speedway for Newman/Haas/Lanigan Racing. Darren Manning, Tomas Scheckter, and Roger Yasukawa also drove the #23 car when Duno was not racing. She had a best finish of 16th and finished 24th in points.
Duno was also among a record number of nine women to participate in ARCA testing in December 2009 at Daytona International Speedway.
2010.
On March 4, 2010, it was announced that Duno would return to the IRL IndyCar Series driving for Dale Coyne Racing full–time for the 2010 season.
Duno failed to qualify for the 2010 Indianapolis 500. Duno competed in 16 of 17 races on the 2010 schedule and the "DNQ" at Indianapolis was the first and only race that she did not qualify for in her 43 race IndyCar Series career.
On Saturday, August 28, 2010, for the first time in history, Duno (along with Danica Patrick, Simona de Silvestro, Ana Beatriz and Sarah Fisher) qualified and ran in an IndyCar Series race that included five women. Duno qualified 26th and finished in 19th place.
ARCA Racing Series.
2010.
Duno made her stock car debut in the ARCA Racing Series' season-opening event at Daytona International Speedway driving the #90 Stringer Motorsports Toyota. She started in 41st place and had picked up 10 positions before being swept up in a 14-car accident on lap 6, ending her day.
2011.
Duno signed with Sheltra Motorsports to race in the ARCA Racing Series' season-opening event at Daytona International Speedway. Assigned to the #63 Dodge, the announcement was the culmination of several months' work by the team to sign Duno to race in the event.
In winter testing at Daytona in January, she was seventh fastest in the first morning of testing, and fifth fastest that afternoon, finishing sixth-fastest overall after the first day's test. For the Lucas Oil Slick Mist 200 at Daytona one month later, Duno qualified 23rd. She had moved up to 12th place with only 16 laps to go when Duno was caught up in a 9-car crash that ended her day and relegated her to 31st place.
It was announced on April 14, 2011, that Duno would run the entire 2011 ARCA Racing Series presented by Menards season for Sheltra Motorsports. Over the first five races of the season, Duno had a best starting position of 8th (Talladega) and a best finishing position of 15th (Toledo) with two DNF's. Duno was originally awarded the pole position due to qualifying being rained out for the Menards 200 presented by Federated Car Care at Toledo Speedway. Unfortunately, she had to start that race at the back of the field in her backup car due to crashing in the final practice.
Duno's season was then cut short when her car was officially pulled from the entry list eight minutes before the June 3 practice session for the Messina Wildlife Animal Stopper 150 at Chicagoland Speedway due to Sheltra Motorsports's decision to abruptly cease operations. Milka and Sheltra Motorsports resumed ARCA Series competition with the July 16 Prairie Meadows 200 at Iowa Speedway. Despite missing seven races, Duno finished 18th in driver points.
In preparation for the 2012 ARCA Series presented by Menards, Duno tested the #63 Citgo Lubricants Sheltra Motorsports Ford during the annual ARCA Daytona International Speedway open test from December 16–18, 2011. In the six test sessions held, Duno was the only driver fastest in two of the sessions and was second in a third session.
2012.
On February 7, 2012, Duno's entry for the Lucas Oil Slick Mist 200 was officially changed from the #63 of Sheltra Motorsports to the #33 of Eddie Sharp Racing. Duno ran both the #33 and #6 of Eddie Sharp Racing in the first 5 races of the 2012 season logging a qualifying high of 16th at Daytona and a high finish of 18th at Mobile. She returned to the series when her crew chief at Sheltra &amp; ESR, Dave Leiner Jr started his own team, Dave Leiner Racing. Duno's first race back was Thunderbolt Raceway at New Jersey Motorsports Park. After qualifying 21st, she finished 10th. This marked her first ARCA top 10 finish, won her the CGS Imaging Hard Charger of the Race award and was the highest place by a Venezuelan driver in ARCA history.
2013.
In her first full season in the ARCA Racing Series, Duno finished the 2013 season seventh in driver championship standings, becoming the second highest finishing female driver in ARCA's 61-year history. Duno's season highlights include earning the pole at Talladega Superspeedway and leading the first 11 laps at Daytona International Speedway from her outside row one starting position. Her pole at Talladega ranks her as one of only four female drivers to earn pole positions in the ARCA Racing Series. Over 21 races in 2013, Duno earned a career-best eighth-place finish at Salem Speedway and a 10th-place finish at Winchester Speedway. Overall, she earned 2 top-10 and 13 top-15 finishes. She would also finish the 2013 season third in CGS Imaging Hard Charger points and third in the S&amp;S Volvo Laps Completed points with a total of 2423 laps completed during the season.
NASCAR.
In August 2014, it was announced that Duno had signed with RAB Racing to drive the team's No. 29 Toyota on a limited basis in the NASCAR Nationwide Series. Duno competed in two Nationwide Series races at Kansas Speedway and Homestead-Miami Speedway, crashing out at Kansas and finishing at Homestead. When she qualified for and competed in the race at Kansas she became the first Hispanic female driver in history to compete in a NASCAR national series in the USA. She also competed in one Camping World Truck Series race, in 2014 she ran MAKE Motorsports' No. 1 truck at Talladega Superspeedway, leading two laps.
Off–track activities.
Through the Milka Way Foundation that Duno founded in 2004, she is engaged in programs such as visits to schools in many of the cities she races in to encourage youth of all races to achieve more academically. In 2008, Duno became a movie actress and a published author. Duno played the role of Kellie "Gearbox", a race car driver, in the live-action-from-animated Warner Brothers movie "Speed Racer". Duno's bilingual kids book, "Go, Milka, Go!", depicted her as an animated character teaching the importance of education. "Go, Milka, Go!" was awarded the Best Young Adult Sports/Recreation Book of 2009 at the 11th Annual International Latino Book Awards.
Criticism.
Duno's IndyCar career was controversial; in a number of instances, she was criticized for running too slow and blocking other drivers.
During the 2007 IndyCar season, Ashley Judd criticized allowing Duno, then a rookie, to race. After the final race, Judd said to reporters, "I know this is not very sportsmanlike, but they've got to get the 23 car (Duno) off the track. It's very dangerous. I'm tired of holding my tongue. She shouldn't be out there. When a car is 10 miles [an hour] off the pace, it's not appropriate to be racing. People's lives are at stake."
In 2008, she was confronted by Danica Patrick after an incident at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course for being too slow during a practice session. At the Grand Prix of Toronto and at Iowa Speedway in 2010, she was parked by officials due to her lack of speed and was subsequently placed on probation by IndyCar for consistently poor performance.

Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway

The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OW&amp;WR) was a railway company in England. It built a line from Wolvercot Junction near Oxford to Worcester, Stourbridge, Dudley and Wolverhampton, as well as some branches. 
It was known locally as the "Old Worse &amp; Worse" due to the perpetual mismanagement of the line leading to poor public perception, and due to the acronym of its name (OW&amp;W).
Its main line was opened in stages between 1852 and 1853. When the West Midland Railway (WMR) was formed by amalgamation in 1860, the OW&amp;WR was the dominant partner, but the West Midland company amalgamated with the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1863. Several branches and extensions were built in the West Midlands, and the main line was developed as an important trunk route.
Much of the original main line is in use at present.
Background.
In 1841 the GWR opened its first main line between London and Bristol. It was engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and the track was on the broad gauge, in contrast to most of the railways already in existence in Great Britain. The broad gauge would, Brunel argued, give greater stability to trains running at speed. In 1844 a branch line from Didcot to Oxford was opened, preparatory to extending the GWR system into the West Midlands. It too was designed by Brunel, and used the broad gauge.
Birmingham and the industrial area of the Black Country were already served, by the London and Birmingham Railway of 1838, and the Grand Junction Railway (GJR). The GJR had opened in 1837, and ran north from Birmingham, skirting Wolverhampton to reach the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.
Approaching Birmingham from the south was the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, opened in 1840; it bypassed Worcester at some distance. In 1845 it became part of the Midland Railway, and linked with the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, forming a through route to Bristol, although with a break of gauge at Gloucester initially.
The opening of these lines gave an enormous impetus to the heavy industry of the areas they served, representing a considerable move forward from the canal-based transport that had formerly been a near-monopoly. At the same time, the limited network generated a demand for further lines serving areas remote from the existing lines, and if possible competition.
Proposal.
Against this background, there was considerable interest in a railway crossing the Black Country to Wolverhampton, its largest town. A line from Oxford could be made, running through Worcester, Kidderminster and Stourbridge to Wolverhampton, and this would connect into a great many locations of industry. The proposed line fell naturally into the Great Western Railway's area of dominance, and Brunel was commissioned to undertake a survey for a broad gauge line.
A prospectus was issued on 22 May 1844; the capital of the company was to be £1,500,000, and negotiations were in hand to lease the line on completion to the Great Western Railway. In fact this was provisionally agreed in September; the lease term was to be 999 years; the GWR would pay a rent of 3.5% on the capital plus 50% of the profits.
The necessary bill incorporating the company went to the 1845 session of Parliament, and received royal assent as the (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. clxxxiv) on 4 August 1845.
Gauge.
The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway Act 1845 required the track gauge to be the same as on the GWR: the broad gauge, but with qualifications.
The line was to start from a junction off the mixed gauge Oxford and Rugby Railway immediately north of Oxford, at Wolvercot Junction.
However, at the northern end it was to terminate by a junction on to the Grand Junction Railway at Bushbury Junction. The Grand Junction was a solidly narrow (standard) gauge railway, and any "junction" must have been a transhipment point.
The waters were muddied by a possible change of heart by the GJR. They had relied on the London and Birmingham Railway (L&amp;BR) for access to London, but relationships had soured when the L&amp;BR planned amalgamation with the Manchester and Birmingham Railway. Fearing that this would bypass their own line, the GJR flirted with the idea of converting to the broad gauge, or at least mixed gauge. This would give it access to London over the , by-passing the .
Webster says that this alarmed the , but "whether the Grand Junction Board ever seriously contemplated relaying their tracks with the broad gauge is extremely doubtful."
The next issue was that the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway had been built passing at some distance from Worcester, a fact that had caused resentment in the city. A spur at Abbots Wood between the two lines would enable B&amp;GR trains to reach Worcester, and it was contemplated that a connecting line from Droitwich to the B&amp;GR line at Stoke Works would form a loop line for the B&amp;GR. The B&amp;GR was a narrow (standard) gauge line, and the loop line would need to be mixed gauge.
Construction.
Initial cost escalation.
In 1846, Francis Rufford, the chairman of the OW&amp;WR saw that the inflation of construction costs brought about by the railway mania, now at its height, meant that the £1.5 million estimate they had used would be inadequate, and he asked the GWR to increase its rent in proportion to the anticipated cost, thought to be £2.5 million at least. The GWR was not immediately opposed to this, and the OW&amp;WR may have understood that the GWR had formally agreed. The OW&amp;WR board improperly represented to prospective shareholders that the GWR guaranteed 4% interest on the whole construction cost whatever that might prove to be, and this led to soured relations between the two companies for a long period later on. (In August 1847 when the OW&amp;WR found itself once again embarrassed financially, it asked the GWR to raise the interest rate to 5%, increasing the bad feeling.)
In 1847, a review of the northern termination of the line was made; rather than simply join the Grand Junction at Bushbury, a spur would be added to reach a proposed joint station at Wolverhampton, shared with the Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Dudley Railway and the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway.
This was authorised by the (11 &amp; 12 Vict. c. cxxxiii) of 14 August 1848; the act also authorised a further million pounds of capital, to be raised by preference shares. As the economy was recovering from the post-mania depression, the French Revolution of 1848 plunged public confidence into turmoil, and for the time being construction ceased due to lack of money. A shareholders' committee was appointed, alarmed at the repeated deferral of construction, and opening of the line. They thought that a further £1.5 million would be needed to complete the line, and they recommended a drastic curtailment of the extent of the construction for the time being. The Board of Trade heard of this and sent Captain Simmons to investigate. His report of 27 November 1849 resulted in the Board of Trade instructing the Great Western Railway to complete the line itself. The 1845 act had authorised the GWR to do so, but the Board of Trade had no power to compel them. Matters stalled for the time being.
Use of trackbed of Shipston-on-Stour line.
The Stratford and Moreton Tramway had been built, opening between Stratford-upon-Avon and Moreton, opening in 1826. It was a horse-operated toll tramway, although there had been grand ideas of continuing to London. An extension to Shipston-on-Stour was opened in 1836, this time with the intention of extending to Coventry. The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. clxxxiv) authorised the new railway to take over the tramway on a perpetual lease; it had debts then of over £48,000.
The Stratford section fell into disuse about 1880, but local people agitated for the Shipston part to be modernised, and it was converted by the GWR into a conventional railway, opening on 1 July 1889, with locomotive operation. It was therefore the Shipston-on-Stour branch of the Great Western Railway. The sharp curves of the tramway alignment made it a slow journey, but passenger operation continued until 8 July 1929. Goods operation continued until closure on 3 May 1960.
Midland Railway and a branch to Worcester.
When the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway was built, its route avoided Worcester by some distance, and this remained a sore point with the city. The Midland Railway had taken over the B&amp;GR in 1846. The OW&amp;WR proposed route crossed the B&amp;GR line at Abbot's Wood, and by agreement the Midland Railway built a short spur between the two lines and laid narrow (standard) gauge track on the OW&amp;WR alignment as far as a temporary station at Tallow Hill, near Shrub Hill in Worcester. It was in effect a single line branch; it opened to Midland Railway trains on 5 October 1850. There were five trains to Bristol daily and six to Birmingham (Curzon Street); the latter journey took over two hours.
On 18 February 1852, the section from Droitwich to Stoke Works Junction, on the Birmingham and Gloucester line (now owned by the Midland Railway) was opened, completing the Worcester loop for the Midland. Now all their Gloucester to Birmingham passenger trains ran via Worcester and Droitwich, leaving their own main line to goods traffic and a very light local connecting service. This too was reduced and was discontinued from the end of September 1855, with all the Midland intermediate stations on their old main line between Abbotswood and Stoke Works Junctions closing permanently.
Trying to regain momentum.
In January 1851, a further special shareholders' meeting was held. Lord Ward, newly elected as chairman, told the meeting that it was time for the OW&amp;WR to take control of its own destiny, forsaking reliance on others (meaning the GWR); and raising a further £850,000 of capital in 6% preference shares. He began negotiations with George Carr Glyn and Samuel Carter of the London and North Western Railway but with mixed success.
The contractors Peto and Betts were contractors for the construction as well as Treadwells. Samuel Morton Peto was associated with a solicitor named John Parson, and he and Peto were elected to the board. Parson arranged an agreement (on 21 February 1851) that the London and North Western Railway and the Midland Railway would work the OW&amp;WR as a line - Carter was solicitor to both of these major companies.
This was in conflict with the company's authorising act, and in May 1851 a group of shareholders secured a restraining order preventing this "illegal act". Parson soon agreed a working arrangement with the Great Western Railway. When the shareholders were asked to ratify this, at Parson's urging they insisted on a clause requiring the GWR to purchase the line after four years. Although this would be at a heavy discount of £30 for every £50 face value OW&amp;WR share, the GWR noted that the market price of the OW&amp;WR shares was £15 and falling, and declined the proposal.
At this time a Stourbridge bank failed, and the £24,000 deposited there by the OW&amp;WR was lost.
Campden Tunnel skirmishes.
A contractor called Marchant was constructing the Campden Tunnel, but in 1851, believing that he was owed money by the OW&amp;WR, ceased work. Parson and Peto decided to occupy the tunnel works and seize Marchant's plant by force, and went there with a gang of workmen. Brunel became involved and he too tried to seize Marchant's equipment, but a magistrate had been called and the Riot Act was read. In the small hours of 23 July 1851 a large force was mustered by Brunel in the absence of the magistrates and a violent skirmish took place, during which Marchant and his men were routed.
Timber viaducts.
There were six timber viaducts, and 57 timber bridges in all, designed by Brunel, on the OW&amp;WR main line. Structures with at least one span over or more than five spans, were, from south to north, at Aldington, Evesham, Fernhill, Fladbury, Hoo Brook (Kidderminster), Blakedown, Stambermill, Parkhead, Tipton (over Birmingham Canal), Dasiey Bank, Bilston (occupation road), Bilston Viaduct, Bilston Quarry, Gibbets Lane, George Street, Tramway Overbridge, and Holyhead turnpike. All except a footbridge were reconstructed by 1893.
Resignation of Brunel.
The methods of Parson and Peto clashed with Brunel's principles as an engineer, and he resigned as engineer of the OW&amp;WR on 17 March 1852. He was succeeded as engineer by John Fowler.
Initial opening.
The Evesham to Stourbridge section of line was practically ready in March 1852 and a date of 1 May 1852 had been fixed for the opening of that part of the line. The financial resources of the company had long been exhausted and the acquisition of the necessary rolling stock was beyond it. A contractor, C. C. Williams, was engaged to work the line and he appointed a young locomotive engineer, David Joy to be his superintendent. Joy took the post on 19 April and now scrambled to get hold of locomotives. He found four, one six-coupled long-boiler engine in good condition, and three small contractors' engines. A special service duly opened on 1 May and a full public service on 3 May 1852. There were four services between Stourbridge and Evesham, taking a little over two hours; in addition there were two short workings between Stourbridge and Kidderminster, and two Sunday services. All this was done with six second hand locomotives.
At first only a single line was available, but by July a double line was opened between Norton Junction and Evesham. Joy had no proper workshop facilities and had to use a local blacksmith for repairs to the engines at first; in fact he did some of the specialist metalwork jobs himself. A proper workshop was finally available to him by March 1855.
The Stourbridge to Dudley section was opened to goods traffic on 16 November 1852, and passenger traffic followed on 20 December 1852; at first this was single line north of Brettell Lane.
By now the company was able to order locomotives to its own specification, and by the end of 1852 eleven out of an order of twenty engines had arrived from R and W Hawthorn. The passenger engines were of the 2-4-0 type and the goods engines were 0-6-0. All the OW&amp;WR rolling stock was narrow (standard) gauge.
The part of the line between Wolvercot Junction and Evesham was nearing completion and was planned to open on 21 April 1853, as a mixed gauge single line. When there was an earth slip near Campden tunnel this was postponed to 7 May, but Captain Galton of the Board of Trade refused to sanction passenger opening as the broad gauge track was incomplete, as was the junction at Wolvercot. A special excursion for the Directors was run anyway on 7 May. On the return journey to Oxford the excursion was running late and the "Cheltenham Chronicle" reported that a signalman Charles Marles had entered the Campden tunnel and received fatal injuries from the overdue train. Three more inspections took place before opening was sanctioned and passenger operation started on 4 June 1853.
The line between Evesham and Wolvercot Junction was soon doubled, but the second track was narrow (standard) gauge, contrary to the authorising act of Parliament. Parson took a combative line when this was queried by the Board of Trade, and this resulted in their obtaining an injunction against use of the unapproved track. On 18 March 1854 the line reverted to mixed gauge single line, and Parson refused for some time to comply with the BoT requirement. At length the second line was reopened on 20 March 1855 when a broad gauge rail had been installed, and the line was doubled as far as Campden.
On 1 December 1853, the line opened between Dudley and Tipton, which included a curve to join the Stour Valley Line of the London and North Western Railway. This was encouraged by Parson who still wished to ally the line with the LNWR, and trains could now run to Wolverhampton over that company's line from Tipton.
There was a delay in getting running powers into Oxford station over the GWR, as successors to the Oxford and Rugby Railway. These were eventually agreed on 4 August 1853; at the same time the GWR was allowed running powers between Priestfield and Cannock Road Junction at Wolverhampton. (Its line connecting at Priestfield was not yet ready.) The OW&amp;WR had contemplated not proceeding with the construction between Tipton and Wolverhampton, but the GWR relied on part of it to reach the Shrewsbury line, and in this case Parson relented and arranged for the line to be built.
Further openings and enhancements.
On 13 April 1854, a broad gauge train travelled the entire length of the main line between Oxford and Wolverhampton, and on 1 July that same year the last section of the OW&amp;WR was opened to passengers, between Tipton and Cannock Road Junction; this followed the opening to goods which had taken place in April 1854. The Low Level station at Wolverhampton was unfinished, and for a time some OW&amp;WR passenger trains continued to use the LNWR Stour Valley line.
On 14 November 1854, the Great Western Railway opened its line between Birmingham Snow Hill and Wolverhampton Low Level. It joined the OW&amp;WR at Priestfield. A mixed gauge link was opened from Cannock Road Junction to Stafford Road Junction.
From this time, GWR passenger trains ran from Paddington and Birmingham to Wolverhampton, using the running powers over the OW&amp;WR from Priestfield; these were the only regular broad gauge trains to run on the OW&amp;WR, ceasing in October 1868. (In 1864 to 1867 there was a passenger service between Wolverhampton GWR and Manchester via Bushbury Junction; this was the only regular passenger service to use the section of line.)
Termination of the working contract.
Early in 1855, the company terminated the working arrangement with C. C. Williams.
Amalgamation.
In 1854, the Great Western Railway took over narrow (standard) gauge railways around Shrewsbury, and its attitude to narrow gauge traffic began to soften.
This gradual process resulted, in February 1858, in the GWR relaxing its hostility to the use of the narrow gauge on the OW&amp;WR and the abandonment of the broad gauge rails. This needed legislative approval, and this was gained in the (22 &amp; 23 Vict. c. lxxvi) in February 1859.
On 14 June 1860, the OW&amp;WR joined with the Worcester and Hereford Railway and the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway, together forming the West Midland Railway. The effective date was 1 July 1860. The OW&amp;WR was the major partner in the new company. The enthusiasm for amalgamation went further, and in 1861 the OW&amp;WR and the GWR agreed that amalgamation was desirable. The arrangement was authorised by an act of Parliament, the Great Western Railway (West Midland Amalgamation) Act 1863 (26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. cxiii) of 13 July 1863 and the effective date was 1 August 1863.
Branch lines.
Yarnton Loop.
Parson and Peto had long been manipulating to find a route to London independent of the Great Western Railway, a fact which naturally annoyed the GWR. After some failed parliamentary bills for a new line from north of Oxford to London, they managed to get approval for the Buckinghamshire Junction Railway, more usually known as the Yarnton Loop, a short link between Yarnton and a junction with the London and North Western Railway's line from Oxford to Bletchley.
This opened on 1 April 1854, from which time OW&amp;WR trains ran to London Euston via Bletchley. This was something of a Pyrrhic victory as the route was very lengthy. The service was discontinued in September 1861.
Chipping Norton branch.
When the OW&amp;WR was opened, Chipping Norton was a flourishing wool town, five miles from the line, but there was no station on the line to serve it. William Bliss, owner of the biggest mill in the town repeatedly requested the OW&amp;WR to provide a station near the town, but without success. Bliss met with Sir Morton Peto, a director of the OW&amp;WR and the two men agreed to finance a branch line themselves, with some contribution by other local businesspeople. The line from Chipping Norton Junction, later named Kingham, opened on 10 August 1855.
Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway.
From the opening of the Chipping Norton branch and the Bourton-on-the-Water branch, their alignment on the map encouraged ideas of forming a trunk railway. Iron ore from the East Midlands was in demand in South Wales, as ores of differing qualities were required for mixing there. These facts led to the Great Western Railway promoting its Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway. The part of this line from Bourton-on-the-Water to Cheltenham opened on 1 June 1881. This was followed by the extension of the Chipping Norton branch to King's Sutton, near Banbury, opening on 6 April 1887. Additionally there were ironstone workings on the course of the new line.
Through mineral trains required to reverse in Chipping Norton Junction station, until in 1906 a spur line connecting the two arms of the branch and crossing the main line, was opened, to goods on 8 January 1906 and to passenger trains on 1 May 1906. There was a single regular passenger train that used the new spur, a Swansea to Newcastle upon Tyne through train, operated jointly with the Great Central Railway.
The Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway was purchased by the GWR in 1897 for £138,000 cash.
Chipping Norton Junction station was renamed Kingham in 1909.
Kingswinford branch.
On 14 November 1858 the OW&amp;WR opened a line from a junction at Kingswinford to a canal basin at Bromley. The branch was about a mile long. It was later extended to the Earl of Dudley's Railway at Pensnett.
Stratford branch.
The (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. cclxxviii) authorised a branch line to Stratford from Honeybourne. The company experienced considerable difficulty over land acquisition, and two extensions of time had to be sought; the line did not open until 11 July 1859. The branch started northwards from Honeybourne, and there were intermediate stations at Long Marston and Milcote, and the Stratford terminus was in Sanctuary Lane. The line was single-track, with sharp curves because of its intended minor branch status.
In the following year, 1860, the Stratford on Avon Railway line from Hatton to Stratford opened to its own independent station in Stratford. Both stations were inconveniently sited for the town, and despite tensions between the GWR and the OW&amp;WR, agreement was reached to connect the two routes and provide a central station. This was completed on 24 July 1863. The line was doubled in 1907 - 1908.
Bourton-on-the-Water branch.
The OW&amp;WR obtained the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway Act 1859 (22 &amp; 23 Vict. c. lxxvi) to build a branch line from Chipping Campden Junction to Bourton-on-the-Water. Morton Peto was the contractor, and the line opened on 1 March 1862. It was in length and had one intermediate station serving Stow-on-the-Wold, although that station was inconveniently sited for its community.
Severn Valley Line.
In 1853, a nominally independent company, sponsored by the OW&amp;WR, obtained its authorising act of Parliament, the Severn Valley Railway Act 1853 (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. ccxxvii), to construct the Severn Valley Railway, from Hartlebury on the OW&amp;WR through Bewdley, Bridgnorth and Ironbridge to Shrewsbury. Further acts were secured, the ' (18 &amp; 19 Vict. c. clxxxi), and the ' (19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. cxxxvii), amending the route, and construction did not begin until 1858. At 40 miles in extent, it was the longest OW&amp;WR branch, and it finally opened to traffic on 1 February 1862, by which time the OW&amp;WR had amalgamated into the West Midland Railway. There was considerable, and diverse, industry on the route which was much stimulated by the railway from the outset. Later, weekend leisure and tourism also featured heavily, especially from 1900 to 1950.
The south-facing connection at Hartlebury proved to be a significant limitation, and the Great Western Railway constructed a route leading north-east from Bewdley to Kidderminster, which opened on 1 June 1878.
Stourbridge Extension Railway.
In 1860, the Stourbridge Railway was authorised by the Stourbridge Railway Act 1860 (23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. xciv) to build a railway line between Stourbridge and Cradley Heath. The following year the Stourbridge Railway Extension Act 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. ccxxi) authorised an extension of that to join the LNWR main line at Galton Junction, and in 1862 a further extension was approved to reach the Great Western Railway line at Handsworth Junction. The line was opened to Cradley Heath with an intermediate station at Lye, on 1 April 1863. That portion was worked by the West Midland Railway, and when that company was absorbed into the Great Western Railway the GWR took over the working. On 1 January 1866 the line was opened to Old Hill and throughout on 1 April 1867. The line had formidable gradients and banking of heavy goods trains was commonplace. The Stourbridge Railway was absorbed by the GWR on 1 February 1870.
Netherton to Old Hill line.
The West Midland Railway obtained an authorising act of Parliament, the West Midland Railway (Additional Works) Act 1862 (25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. clxviii) of 17 July 1862 for a line connecting the Stourbridge Extension line at Old Hill to the OW&amp;WR main line near Netherton. Completion was much delayed: it opened on 1 March 1878. There was one intermediate station at Windmill End, and Netherton station was transferred on to the line from the OW&amp;WR main line.
In September 1905, the GWR introduced steam railmotors on the line, and opened three new halts; the area was heavily industrialised and passenger usage was heavy.
After World War II passenger usage declined steeply, and the passenger service was confined to the peak hours in 1958. this was followed by closure to passengers on 13 June 1964, and goods operation finished at the end of 1967.
Stourbridge Town branch.
The Stourbridge station of the OW&amp;WR was over a mile from the town: goods were brought up to the railway from the town on a rope-worked inclined plane at a gradient of 1-in-14.
On 30th July 1859, a branch was completed from the OWWR main line to the north of the viaduct, probably very close to where the junction to the engine shed was to be located, to the ironworks that had been built on the western side of Lower High Street… There was a hope that the branch would be available for passenger traffic. However, due to the steepness of the incline (1 in 14), which necessitated traffic having to be winched up and down using a cable attached to a stationary engine, it was doubtful that such traffic could be handled safely.
In time, this was considered to be unsatisfactory and the Great Western Railway Act 1874 (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. lxxiv) for construction of a short branch to a Town station was secured by the GWR on 30 June 1874. The little branch was also on a gradient of 1 in 67 with double track, and beyond the new "Town" station there was a 1 in 27 gradient leading down to sidings on the River Stour. The passenger part of the line opened on 1 May 1879 and the goods extension on 1 January 1880. The new station was called Stourbridge, and the existing Stourbridge station was renamed Stourbridge Junction. The branch curved round to the north to reach the junction station on joining the main line, but in 1901 Stourbridge Junction station was relocated further south, and the branch was altered to run to it and to face the south.
The branch was closed to passengers from 29 March 1915 to 1 May 1919, after which it was reopened as a passenger shuttle service between Stourbridge Junction and Stourbridge Town.
GWR trains to Paddington.
On 1 October 1861, through passenger trains from Wolverhampton to Paddington over the OW&amp;WR started running. Hitherto there had been a through service to Euston over the Yarnton Loop, but that ceased on the same day.
WMR amalgamated with the GWR.
Effective from 1 August 1863, the West Midland Railway was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway by the Great Western Railway (West Midland Amalgamation) Act 1863 (26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. cxiii). The accounts of the WMR were kept separately for some years; the former Worcester and Hereford Railway shareholders received a guaranteed 5% (because of earlier agreements) and the OW&amp;WR shareholders got 72% of the residue. This arrangement continued until 1870. The whole of the OW&amp;WR (except the Chipping Norton and Stratford branches) was laid with longitudinal timber track. There were 76 timber viaducts and timber underbridges in aggregate on the main line and branches. The former OW&amp;WR contributed 59 locomotives.
Cheltenham to Stratford main line.
The Great Western Railway had long regretted the loss to the Midland Railway of the Birmingham to Bristol line in 1845. As the GWR network in the West Midlands grew, the difficulty increased. It had running powers over the Midland line, but with intensive traffic this became more unsatisfactory. At the end of the nineteenth century the GWR contemplated building an independent route from Cheltenham to Stratford, using the existing Honeybourne to Stratford line of 1859.
The old branch needed considerable upgrading work, including doubling the line and easing many of the curves. The section between Honeybourne and Cheltenham was completely new, and the route opened throughout on 1 July 1908. Honeybourne station was considerably extended, with four platforms, and with loop connections to enable direct running to and from the OW&amp;WR main line, though not directly to or from the direction of Oxford, only directly to or from the direction of Worcester. Trains travelling directly between Cheltenham and Stratford did not go through Honeybourne station but went on a railway line through fields some distance to the east of Honeybourne station. Many express passenger trains as well as through freight were diverted to the new route, and traffic was especially heavy after World War I on summer Saturdays when holiday trains from the West Midlands and places further north to the West of England were dominant.
A significant weakness of the route was that it passed through relatively undeveloped countryside, with comparatively few major settlements intermediately.
Grouping.
In 1923, the railways of Great Britain were "grouped" in to one or other of four new large companies, following the Railways Act 1921. The Great Western Railway and certain other railways were constituents of the new Great Western Railway.
Kingswinford to Oxley.
The Great Western Railway saw that it had the Kingswinford Railway, to a canal and colliery at Pensnett; it thought that it could usefully be extended to Oxley, on the line from Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury. It prepared several bills over time to get authorisation, finally succeeding on 1905. Construction was slow, further delayed by World War I, and the line opened on 11 May 1925. The passenger service was discontinued from 31 October 1932.
Diesel railcars.
From July 1935, a GWR diesel railcar was put in service at Worcester, followed by several more. The vehicles were a more economical means of providing a passenger service on less-busy routes, and they were widely employed on the former OW&amp;WR network. These vehicles and a later variant continued in use until 1962.
Nationalisation.
On nationalisation in 1948, the line became part of the Western Region of British Railways.
After 1960.
Near Stratford a new south to east curve was installed on 12 June 1960, which allowed the line northwards to be closed; mineral trains conveying iron ore from Northamptonshire to South Wales used the curve, and the line northwards was closed to that traffic. The flow ceased on to 1 March 1965 and the curve was removed.
The line between Stourbridge Junction and Priestfield Junction was closed to passenger trains after 29 July 1962. It remained open to goods trains until December 1967.
The Severn Valley line closed on 8 September 1963, although the Kidderminster to Bewdley loop and the Hartlebury to Bewdley sections operated a thin passenger service until closure on 3 January 1970.
However a group of railway enthusiasts formed the Severn Valley Railway as a heritage railway in 1967 and in 1970 steam operated trains resumed running. At the present day the line operates between Kidderminster and Bridgnorth.
The Kingswinford to Oxley line was closed north of Pensnett on 27 February 1965, and throughout in 1990.
The Old Hill to Dudley line closed to passenger services after 13 June 1964.
The section of the railway between Stourbridge and Dudley was later absorbed into the South Staffordshire Line, which continued to Walsall after forking off eastwards from Dudley. Passenger services had all been withdrawn by 1965, but goods trains continued to serve the route until 1993, when the line north of was mothballed. The line is still open for freight to this point to serve Round Oak Steel Terminal.
The Cheltenham – Honeybourne – Stratford route was less significant in British Railways days, and when the traffic declined in the 1960s the route was not any longer important. From September 1966 long-distance trains were diverted to other routes, chiefly the Midland route via the Lickey Incline, and in May 1969 the local passenger service between Stratford and Worcester was closed down, together with Honeybourne station itself. Goods traffic between Honeybourne and Cheltenham ceased in August 1976. The section from Honeybourne to Long Marston was retained because of the Royal Engineers depot there.
The Stourbridge Town branch was closed to goods operation in July 1965; the passenger part of the line was successively cut back but is still in operation. In 2006 trial operation of the branch started using a lightweight vehicle from Parry People Movers Ltd. The vehicle uses a flywheel for energy storage to supplement the engine power.
The main line between Moreton and Norton Junction was singled in the Autumn of 1971; there was only one passing loop, at Evesham, in this long single line route.
Honeybourne station was reopened on 22 May 1981.
On 19 March 1993 the final operation of through freight on the Dudley to Stourbridge route took place.
The main line of the former OW&amp;WR had been singled in the 1960s, and there were moves to reinstate double track at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The new double track section between Charlbury and Ascott was commissioned on 6 June 2011, and the section between Moreton and Evesham on 22 August 2011.
The former OW&amp;WR network is (2017) still in use from Oxford to Round Oak, as well as the Norton Junction spur and the Stoke Works connection. A short length near Bushbury Junction has been reused as part of a loop from Stafford Road Junction.
Round Oak accident.
On 23 August 1858 an excursion train was run from Wolverhampton to Worcester. 1,506 adults and children were on board. On the return journey the excursion was run in two portions. Ascending the steep gradient between Brettell Road and Round Oak, the first portion came to a stand, and part of the train ran back down the gradient and struck the second portion which was following. The time interval system of operation was in use.
There had been a number of failures of the couplings on the journey, and numerous badly made welds were later found. It appears that the head guard alighted from his van to deal with a broken coupling, and was unable to regain his post to apply the brakes. 14 passengers died and about 50 were badly injured.

Transpression

In geology, transpression is a type of strike-slip deformation that deviates from simple shear because of a simultaneous component of shortening perpendicular to the fault plane. This movement ends up resulting in oblique shear. It is generally very unlikely that a deforming body will experience "pure" shortening or "pure" strike-slip. The relative amounts of shortening and strike-slip can be expressed in the convergence angle alpha which ranges from zero (ideal strike-slip) to 90 degrees (ideal convergence). During shortening, unless material is lost, transpression produces vertical thickening in the crust. Transpression that occurs on a regional scale along plate boundaries is characterized by oblique convergence. More locally, transpression occurs within restraining bends in strike-slip fault zones.
Transpressional structures.
Transpressional shear zones are characterized by an association of structures that suggest zone-normal shortening and zone-parallel shearing. Commonly developed features include transposition foliations, lineations, stylolites, folds, and reverse faults. Pure shear-dominated transpression usually gives steep lineations, while simple shear-dominated transpression favors horizontal lineations. It is also common for non-vertical transpressional zones to have a significant component of shearing parallel to the dipline of the zone boundary. In these zones, the lineations are between horizontal and vertical. The complete geometry presented by all structural elements in the zone is used to constrain the actual boundary displacements.
Restraining bend.
A fault bend, or fault stepover, forms when individual segments of the fault overlap and link together. The type of structures which form along the strike-slip fault depend on the sense of slip relative to the sense of stepping. When a sinistral fault steps to the right or a dextral fault steps to the left, a restraining bend is formed. Geologists may also refer to a restraining bend as a left bend. These are areas of positive relief (topographic uplift), crustal shortening, and exhumation of crystalline basement. As seen in deeply eroded outcrop exposures or from subsurface geophysical surveys, restraining bends commonly define positive flower structures. In plan view we see them form contractional strike-slip duplexes, subparallel reverse or oblique-slip contractional faults that are bounded by two strike-slip segments. Restraining bends are widespread on the Earth's surface, from sub-outcrop-scale examples to large scale mountain ranges. They have been theorized to occur on extraterrestrial bodies, like Jupiter's icy moon Europa and on Venus.

River Wampool

The River Wampool is a river flowing through north western Cumbria in England. It is in the "Waver and Wampool" (or "Wampool and Waver") catchment which includes the towns of Silloth and Wigton.
Headwaters.
The river is formed at Chalkfoot near East Curthwaite, where water from Cardew Mires flowing in Gill Beck is joined by the Chalk Beck. Chalk Beck rises close to Wavergillhead and runs north, meeting Iron Gill and proceeding through a wooded clough to Chalkfoot, helping define the western edge of Inglewood Forest.
River Wampool.
The Wampool initially flows westwards from Wampool Bridge near West Curthwaite to Crofton Bridge near Thursby. From here on it powered a number of watermills. The mill race from Woodside Mill joins shortly after Crofton. The Wampool is joined by Whinnow Beck at Micklethwaite, with Whins Mill and then Moorhouse Mill nearby. The next tributary is the Pow Beck. The Wampool continues northwards through Gamelsby, which has another mill. At Biglands, it is joined by Bampton Beck, and continues to Wampool farm and grange.
Estuary.
The Wampool flows northwards towards Angerton, where it bends westwards. From this point, it runs parallel to the River Eden, demarcating the Bowness peninsula. It then joins the River Waver to form Moricambe Bay and flows past Anthorn into the Solway Firth.
For much of its length the river forms the boundary between the parishes of Woodside to the west and Thursby and Aikton to the east and north.

1973 United Kingdom local elections

The first elections to the new local authorities established by the Local Government Act 1972 in England and Wales and the new Northern Ireland district councils created by the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 took place in 1973. Elections to the existing Greater London Council also took place.
England and Wales.
The elections took place on three dates:
Elections took place for all the seats on the councils. In the case of the new councils, they became shadow authorities, taking over from the existing local authorities on 1 April 1974. The elections for the new councils had been brought forward from an originally planned date in November 1973, to allow the councils more time to act as shadow authorities - the final dates were set in May 1972.
The April elections.
The elections held on 12 April saw a very impressive performance by the Labour Party, which regained control of the Greater London Council and took control of all six of the new metropolitan county councils. In the rest of England, they won seven county councils, including two of the new "estuary" counties: Cleveland and Humberside. The party also won Gwent and the three Glamorgan county councils (West Glamorgan, Mid Glamorgan, South Glamorgan) in Wales.
The poor Conservative vote in London and the metropolitan counties was somewhat compensated by winning thirteen of the non-metropolitan counties. Failure to gain Essex or Hertfordshire were disappointments to the party, but taking control of Gloucestershire was a success. The party also failed to gain its only realistic Welsh prospect, South Glamorgan.
There were no great successes for the Liberal party, which found itself in third place in all the metropolitan counties. They did however gain representation on the GLC for the first time, winning two seats at Sutton and Cheam and Richmond upon Thames. This followed the previous year's by-election success in winning the Sutton and Cheam parliamentary seat from the Conservatives.
Independents won two English counties outright: Cornwall and the Isle of Wight. They also formed the largest grouping on a number of other councils, and entered agreements with the Conservatives in the running of some of these. In Wales, Independents controlled three mainly rural counties.
The May elections.
The results of the elections in May saw an improvement in the performance by the Conservatives since the county council elections, and a slight fall back in the Labour vote. The Liberals had a notable success, becoming the largest group on Liverpool council.
The Conservatives took control of five metropolitan districts, gaining seats in areas where they had been beaten in the elections to the county councils. They also gained one Welsh district, Monmouth.
The Labour party declared it was pleased with the results, especially as opinion polls had shown them losing support. They took control of most of the metropolitan districts, making a clean sweep of councils in Tyne and Wear and South Yorkshire and important councils such as Birmingham, Coventry and Manchester. Labour also took control of most districts in South Wales including Cardiff. The party's organiser for Wales also pointed to the fact that official Labour candidates won rural seats in north and west Wales for the first time.
Apart from forming a minority administration in Liverpool, the Liberals were able to hold the balance of power at Leeds, Stockport and Wirral. They were however disappointed with their performance at Calderdale which was won by Labour.
The June elections.
In the June elections for 296 non-metropolitan districts, Labour won control of 71, the Conservatives 59, the Liberals 1, Democratic Labour 1, and Independents 67. 97 councils were under no overall control: in many of these councils Conservative and Independent groups formed an administration.
The Labour party won 4,327 seats, the Conservatives 4,286, Independents 3,534, and the Liberals 919; with the remaining 449 seats going to various other groupings.
It was a good result for the Liberal party who took control of Eastbourne and became the largest group on Adur, Newbury, Pendle and Waverley councils. The other two main parties also had notable successes: Labour considered control of Cambridge, Dacorum, Ipswich and Oxford to be good results; while the Conservatives celebrated taking Gloucester, Great Yarmouth, Lewes and Warrington councils.
The break-away Lincoln Democratic Labour Association won twenty of the thirty seats on Lincoln District council. The group were supporters of Dick Taverne, member of parliament for Lincoln who had been expelled from the Labour Party. Taverne had earlier in the year resigned his seat to force a by-election in protest against his expulsion, which he won against the official Labour candidate.
Future elections.
The next county council elections took place in 1977.
Future elections to Metropolitan District councils were to be by thirds, with the one third of seats being elected in 1975.
The next election of non-metropolitan district councils and Welsh district councils was to in 1976.
Northern Ireland.
Local government in Northern Ireland was reorganised in 1973 by the Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971 and the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972. The county councils, county borough and municipal borough corporations and urban and rural district councils were replaced by twenty-six Local Government districts. Elections took place for all the seats on the district councils on 30 May, and the councils came into their power in 1 October.
Scotland.
Local elections were also held in Scotland in 1973. At the time of the election, Scotland was the only part of the UK in which local government had yet to be reformed, with the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 only receiving Royal Assent in October 1973. The election saw Labour maintaining their control of Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Dundee, although failing to make gains in Edinburgh.

Battle of Schwaderloh

The Battle of Schwaderloh took place on 11 April 1499 near Triboltingen, a village on the Swiss shores of the "Untersee" just south of Constance. It was one of the major battles of the Swabian War between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the forces of the Swabian League and of Emperor Maximilian I. 
The Swabians had assembled a large army at Constance in April 1499. Constance, situated on the north shore of the river Rhine, was an ideal gateway for expeditions into Swiss territories of the Thurgau south of Lake Constance. The Swiss had prepared for an attack and set up their main camp at Schwaderloh, a small village only a few kilometers south of Constance, and had garrisoned the villages on the southern shores of the lake. Already in the weeks before the battle, minor skirmishes had taken place, and the Swabian cannons on the island Reichenau had laid fire on the village of Ermatingen.
In the early morning of 11 April 1499, a large Swabian army of about 4,500 to 6,000 foot soldiers and some 400 to 600 knights under the command of Count Wolfgang von Fürstenberg poured forth from the city gates of Constance. They crossed the river and drove back the small Swiss garrisons in the villages of Ermatingen, Mannenbach, and Triboltingen. They captured two cannons at Ermatingen, which had been sent by the city of Lucerne to answer the fire from Reichenau. Seeing the Swiss retreat, the troops turned to looting and burning the villages, and began already to transport back their bounty to Constance. Attempts of the Swabian commanders to maintain battle order were ignored by the soldiers.
The Swiss troops retreated through the woods to Schwaderloh, where the main contingent of the Swiss camped. They quickly assembled their forces and marched with some 1,400 to 1,800 men to Triboltingen. Between Triboltingen and Gottlieben, they attacked the disorganized Swabians and took them by surprise. The mostly inexperienced Swabian footsoldiers took to flight immediately. Only the knights withstood them for some time and managed to fire some cannon shots; when smoke obscured the view the Swiss were able to engage in close combat and routed them. The Swiss had divided their forces into two at this point—the pikemen continuing to fight the Swabian knights, while the halberdiers and other troops pursued the routing Swabian foot soldiers. The Swabians fled the battlefield in disarray, leaving behind not only their bounty but also all of their artillery, including the two cannons they had captured in the morning at Ermatingen. Many tried to flee by swimming across the lake, leaving behind their weapons and armor. At least 80 soldiers drowned in the lake, many others died in the swamplands between Gottlieben and Constance. Contemporary sources report that many Swabian soldiers fled in panic as far away as Überlingen and Radolfzell. The Swiss pursued them until the city gates of Constance; and they took no prisoners: any wounded soldiers left on the battlefield were killed.

Genting Sempah Tunnel

The Genting Sempah Tunnel is the first highway tunnel in Malaysia. Located on the Kuala Lumpur–Karak Expressway, the tunnel connects Gombak in Selangor to Genting Sempah, Pahang. This tunnel was constructed between 1974 and 1977. The tunnel was officially opened in 1978 by the former Minister of Works and Communications, Abdul Ghani Gilong.
The tunnel was once used to be the longest road tunnel in Malaysia before the construction of the 4-km SMART Tunnel which was opened in 2007.
Originally, the Genting Sempah Tunnel was used to be a 2-lane single-carriageway tunnel but then an additional tunnel for the eastbound traffic was constructed between 1995 and 1997 when the Karak Expressway was upgraded from a 2-lane highway to a high-speed multi-lane expressway.

Tony Mason (co-driver)

Tony Mason is a British former rally co-driver and television presenter. In 1972, he navigated Roger Clark to victory in the RAC Rally and the team also finished second in the event twice in 1974 and 1975, the only British crew to do so in a period spanning 35 years. He has also competed as a driver himself, and was recently co-driver for Finnish driver Hannu Mikkola with whom he competed for Ford in a recent Classic Rally in New Zealand.
Biography.
Following his retirement from rallying, he became a presenter on the BBC Two motoring programme "Top Gear" between 1986 and 1998, where he commented on motorsport, as well as presenting general interest items about items such as fire engines, Leyland buses, vintage Rolls-Royces and high-performance Jaguars through to Eddie Stobart trucks and Volvo's £15 million concept bus – the most expensive vehicle that he, or anyone else on "Top Gear", has ever driven.
A particularly memorable report was when Mason teamed up again with Roger Clark to test an exact replica of his Ford Escort RS1600 on the programme at full speed through a forest.
He was also regularly seen on "Top Gear Motorsport" where his co presenters gave him the nickname "Perry". and the BBC's coverage of the World Rally Championship, particularly the RAC Rally, as well as coverage of the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Mason is currently appearing in two ten-part series on the Sky Discovery Channel entitled "Off the Road" and "Classic Car Club".
Mason has also written four books and occasionally writes articles for newspapers and magazines, such as the "Daily Telegraph" and the "Daily Express". He is often seen as both a compere and after-dinner speaker.
Mason also ran a company, known as Tony Mason, selling car accessories to the trade for resale to the general public. The company's most notable products were door guards, which, at one time, were big business and two companies were selling them.

Pantera discography

The following is the discography of Pantera, an American heavy metal band. Pantera formed in the early 1980s and released four studio albums in their early years through their own record label, Metal Magic Records. The band's major-label debut, "Cowboys from Hell" (1990), peaked at number 27 on the "Billboard" Heatseekers chart in the United States, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The following year, "" was released; it included video clips produced for "Cowboys from Hell". The video was certified gold by the RIAA.
Pantera's second major-label album, "Vulgar Display of Power" (1992), reached number 44 on the "Billboard" 200, and was later certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association and the RIAA. "Vulgar Display of Power" produced two singles, "Mouth for War" and "Walk"; both songs have accompanying music videos included on 1993's "Vulgar Video". This video was certified platinum by the RIAA. After touring for two years, the group released "Far Beyond Driven" (1994), which debuted at #1 on the US "Billboard" 200 and Australian ARIA charts, reached the top five in Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was certified platinum in Canada and the U.S. The album produced three singles: "5 Minutes Alone", "I'm Broken", and the Black Sabbath cover, "Planet Caravan"; which reached the top 30 in the U.S. Mainstream Rock Tracks and UK singles chart. "The Great Southern Trendkill" (1996) peaked at numbers two and four on the US "Billboard" 200 and Australian ARIA charts respectively, and reached the top five on the Finland YLE lista and New Zealand RIANZ charts.
"" (1997) reached the top 20 in four countries, and was certified gold by the RIAA. Later that year, the band issued "3 Watch It Go", which features music videos for all singles of "Far Beyond Driven", and another for the song "Drag the Waters" from "The Great Southern Trendkill". It was certified platinum by the RIAA. "3 Vulgar Videos from Hell" (1999) combines the band's previous home videos into a DVD. It was certified platinum in the US and Australia. Pantera's final studio album, "Reinventing the Steel" (2000), became their second release to peak at numbers two and four on the US "Billboard" 200 and Australian ARIA charts, respectively. The best-of album " ," which combined the titles of the band's four major-label albums, was released in the US on September 23, 2003. Although it only reached number 38 on the "Billboard" 200, the album was certified platinum by the RIAA. The of the compilation features a different track list; both albums include a bonus DVD with their music videos. Later in that year, Pantera broke up, and members Vinnie Paul and Dimebag Darrell subsequently formed the group Damageplan.

John Hewitt (poet)

John Harold Hewitt (28 October 1907 – 22 June 1987) was perhaps the most significant Belfast poet to emerge before the 1960s generation of Northern Irish poets that included Seamus Heaney, Derek Mahon and Michael Longley. He was appointed the first writer-in-residence at Queen's University Belfast in 1976. His collections include "The Day of the Corncrake" (1969) and "Out of My Time: Poems 1969 to 1974" (1974). He was also made a Freeman of the City of Belfast in 1983, and was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Ulster and Queen's University Belfast.
From November 1930 to 1957, Hewitt held positions in the Belfast Museum &amp; Art Gallery. His radical socialist ideals proved unacceptable to the Belfast Unionist establishment and he was passed over for promotion in 1953. Instead in 1957 he moved to Coventry, a city still rebuilding following its devastation during World War II . Hewitt was appointed Director of the Herbert Art Gallery &amp; Museum where he worked until retirement in 1972.
Hewitt had an active political life, describing himself as "a man of the left", and was involved in the British Labour Party, the Fabian Society and the Belfast Peace League. He was attracted to the Ulster dissenting tradition and was drawn to a concept of regional identity within the island of Ireland, describing his identity as Ulster, Irish, British and European. John Hewitt officially opened the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre (BURC) Offices on Mayday 1985.
His life and work are celebrated in two prominent ways – the annual John Hewitt International Summer School – and, less conventionally, a Belfast pub is named after him – the John Hewitt Bar and Restaurant, which is situated on the city's Donegall Street and which opened in 1999. The bar was named after him as many years earlier he had opened the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre, which owns the establishment. It is a popular meeting place for local writers, musicians, journalists, students and artists. Both the Belfast International Arts Festival and the Belfast Film Festival use the venue to stage events.
Hewitt's life and writing.
Early life.
After attending Agnes Street National School, Hewitt attended the Royal Belfast Academical Institution from 1919 to 1920 before moving to Methodist College Belfast, where he was a keen cricketer. In 1924, he started an English degree at the Queen's University of Belfast, obtaining a BA in 1930, which he followed by obtaining a teaching qualification from Stranmillis College, Belfast. During these years, his calling to radical and socialist causes deepened; he heard James Larkin address a Labour rally, began to write for a range of Trades Union and Socialist publications, and co-founded a journal entitled "Iskra". Hewitt also attended the Northern Ireland Labour Party Annual Conference as a Belfast City delegate in 1929 and 1930. He resisted the advocacy of a workers' republic in the party's constitution.
In 1930, Hewitt was appointed Art Assistant at the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery, where amongst other duties, he gave public lectures on art, at one of which he met Roberta "Ruby" Black, whom he was to marry in 1934. Roberta was also a convinced Socialist, and the couple became members of the Independent Labour Party, the Belfast Peace League, the Left Book Club and the British Civil Liberties Union.

Hewitt began experimenting with poetry while still a schoolboy at Methodist College in the 1920s. Typically thorough, his notebooks from these years are filled with hundreds of poems, in dozens of styles; Hewitt's main influences at this time included William Blake, William Morris and W. B. Yeats, and for the most part the verse is either highly romantic, or strongly socialist, a theme which increased in prominence as the 1930s began. Morris is the key figure, combining both these strains, and allowing Hewitt to articulate the radical, dissenting strain which he inherited from his Methodist forebears, including his father.
As the 1920s moved into the 1930s, Hewitt's writing began to develop and mature. Firstly, his role models (including Vachel Lindsay) became more modern; secondly, he discovered in Chinese poetry a voice which was "quiet and undemonstrative but clear and direct", and which answered a part of Hewitt's temperament which had been suppressed. Finally, and most importantly, he began his lifelong work of excavation and discovery of the poetry of Ulster, starting with Richard Rowley, Joseph Campbell and George William Russell (AE). This research culminated, in part, with the publications of "Fibres, Fabric and Cordage" in 1948, "Rhyming Weavers and other Country Poets of Antrim and Down" (based on his MA thesis, "Ulster Poets 1800–1870" of 1951) in 1974, and a book called "The Rhyming Weavers" in 1979. All of these publications and more, were based on his interest in the Ulster rhyming weaver poets of the 19th century, such as Henry MacDonald Flecher, David Herbison, Alexander MacKenzie, James MacKowen, and James Orr.
Hewitt himself felt that his juvenilia ended with the poem "Ireland" (1932), which he placed at the start of his "Collected Poems" (1968), and indeed it is more complex than most of his earlier work, and begins his lifelong preoccupation with bleak landscapes of bog and rock; with exile, and with the nature of belonging.
The 1930s.
The 1930s was a period of transition in Hewitt's poetry, one in which he began seriously to address the history of his native province, and the contradictions between his love for the people and the landscape, his inspiration in the radical dissenting tradition, and the conflicts which mark Northern Ireland. A key text is "The Bloody Brae: A Dramatic Poem" (finished in 1936, though not broadcast – on the Northern Ireland Home Service of the BBC – until 1954; the Belfast Lyric Players performed a stage version in 1957, which they revived in 1986), which tells of a legendary massacre of Roman Catholics by Cromwellian troops in Islandmagee, County Antrim, in 1642. John Hill, one of the soldiers who has been racked by guilt since he participated in the slaughter, returns many years later to beg forgiveness. This he receives from the ghost of one of his victims, a gesture which she wraps in a condemnation of his self-indulgence, luxuriating in his guilt rather than taking positive action to combat bigotry. Another theme which was to become a fixture in Hewitt's poetry also first appears in "The Bloody Brae"; that is, a bold assertion of the right of his people to live in Ulster, rooted in their hard work and commitment to it:
Also in the 1930s, Hewitt was involved with a group of young artists and sculptors known as the 'Ulster Unit', and acted as their secretary.
1940s and 1950s.
From the late thirties Hewitt was one of a set of Linen Hall Library members who would regularly retire to Campbell's Cafe in Belfast's city centre. The regulars, at various points, included writers John Boyd, Denis Ireland, Sam Hanna Bell and Richard Rowley, actors Joseph Tomelty, Jack Loudon and J.G. Devlin, the poet Robert Greacen, artists Padraic Woods, Gerard Dillon, Harry Cooke Knox and William Conor and (an outspoken opponent of sectarianism) the Rev. Arthur Agnew. The ebullient atmosphere the circle created was a backdrop to the appearance of Campbell's Cafe in Brian Moore's wartime "Bildungsroman", The Emperor of Ice-Cream.
During the 1940s and 1950s, Hewitt helped young Ulster poets by providing them with room, board and advice while he increasingly played the role of reviewer and art critic. He gained an MA from Queen's University Belfast, with a thesis on Ulster poets from 1800 to 1870, in 1951. In 1951 he had been appointed deputy director and keeper of art at the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery but in 1957, Hewitt left to take up the position of Art Director at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry, a position he held until 1972. While in Coventry, Hewitt started work on his unpublished autobiography, "A North Light". He subsequently returned to Belfast on his retirement in 1972. The John Hewitt Estate and Four Courts Press published "A North Light: twenty-five years in a Municipal Gallery" in 2013.
Legacy.
The John Hewitt Society was established in 1987 to commemorate his life and work. Its mission is "to promote literature, arts, and culture inspired by the ideals and ideas of the poet John Hewitt". The Society runs an annual summer school.
Bibliography.
Poetry.
Hewitt's poem "Neither an Elegy nor a Manifesto" was recited at the August 2008 remembrance service 10 years after the Omagh bomb. Translations in Irish and Spanish of the final line "Bear in mind these dead" were read out from the site of the blast.

River Waver

The River Waver is a river in Cumbria, England. The river rises at Wavergillhead (as Townthwaite Beck).
It is fed by the northwards flowing Thornthwaite Beck and Pow Gill either side of Bolton Wood Lane.
The "Little Waver", rising at Catlands Hill, joins at Waterside near Woodrow.
The river then takes a northward course via Waverton and Waverbridge, both of which are named for the river, before turning sharply westward at Abbeytown. The river then goes north, running into Moricambe Bay, an inlet of the Solway Firth.

Meet Millie

Meet Millie, a situation comedy about a wisecracking Manhattan secretary from Brooklyn, made a transition from radio to television in the early 1950s. In the live television version, Mom and Millie were living in Jackson Heights, Queens. The popularity of this series led to a four-year run on CBS Television.
Radio.
The radio series began on CBS July 2, 1951, continuing until September 23, 1954. Audrey Totter created the role of Millie Bronson on radio, but she dropped out when her film studio refused to allow her to appear as the character on television.
After seeing Elena Verdugo in Columbia's "Thief of Damascus" (1952), Eddie Bracken’s secretary recommended her to Bracken when a replacement for Totter was needed. Verdugo brought the character to television in October 1952 and also took over the radio role beginning January 1, 1953.
Bea Benaderet originally appeared as Millie's mother on radio, but due to her commitment to play "Blanche Morton" on "The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show", her role was filled by Florence Halop on TV (and eventually on the radio show).
Characters and story.
The show opened with the announcer's introduction: "A gay, new comedy about the life and loves of a secretary in Manhattan. It's time to "Meet Millie"." Millie lived in a Jackson Heights apartment with her mother (Florence Halop), who is continually on the lookout for a possible husband for Millie. Millie's boyfriend, J.R. "Johnnie" Boone, Jr. (Ross Ford), is the son of her boss (Earle Ross, Roland Winters). Aspiring poet-composer Alfred Prinzmetal (Marvin Kaplan) drops in for friendly visits. Isabel Randolph portrayed Mrs. Boone. Other cast regulars were Virginia Vincent, Harry Cheshire and Ray Montgomery.
"Meet Millie", one of the first series telecast from the CBS Television City facility in Hollywood, was seen on CBS from October 25, 1952, until March 6, 1956. The live studio audience responded to "Meet Millie" with such enthusiasm that it was sometimes necessary for the actors to freeze in position until the laughter stopped. Kaplan and Verdugo became friends during the years the show was in production, and their close friendship continued for decades.
An episode of "Meet Millie" was shown September 15, 2000 at the Library of Congress' Mary Pickford Theater. Shows are in the collection of the Paley Center for Media.
Production (TV version).
Jack Donohue and Frank Galen were the producers, and Donohue directed. Galen, Howard Leeds, and Arthur Julian were the writers. The sustaining program originated at KNXT in Hollywood.

Bowaters Paper Railway

The Bowaters Paper Railway was a narrow gauge industrial railway running from Sittingbourne to Ridham Dock on The Swale in the county of Kent. It had the distinction of being the last steam-operated industrial narrow gauge railway in Britain when it closed in 1969. Part of the system still operates as the Sittingbourne &amp; Kemsley Light Railway.
History.
The manufacture of paper at Sittingbourne dates back to the seventeenth century. The paper mill was originally supplied with raw materials by barges that sailed to wharves at the head of Milton Creek. A short horse-hauled tramway moved pulp to the mill. Two steam locomotives were introduced in 1908.
In 1913, as Milton Creek began to silt up, the paper making company began work on the construction of Ridham Dock, a deepwater facility on the Swale estuary, where seagoing ships could unload raw materials and load finished paper products. At the start of the First World War the railway and the dock was taken over by the Admiralty and the railway was extended to connect the dock. After the end of the war the railway was returned to the paper company. In 1924 a second paper mill opened at Kemsley Down, and further extended in 1936. By this time, the railway reached its maximum length of . There was also a Standard gauge system around Kemsley and Ridham Dock that was connected to the Sheerness line near Swale.
Closure, preservation and uncertain future.
In 1969, a time and motion study by the then owners, The Bowater Paper Corporation (Bowater), resulted in the closure of the railway. By this time the railway was the last industrial narrow gauge railway in Britain operating steam locomotives and, until withdrawn from 30 September 1969, had operated a scheduled passenger service for its employees between the Sittingbourne mill and Ridham Dock. Bowaters had a "handing over" ceremony to the news lessees, the Locomotive Club of Great Britain (LCGB), on 4 October 1969 but continued running its goods trains until the final one on 25 October 1969. The LCGB was granted a lease of the southern portion of the railway between Sittingbourne and Kemsley Down in 1970. Much of the rest of the equipment went to form the Great Whipsnade Railway. The LCGB formed the Sittingbourne and Kemsley Light Railway Company to operate the railway. The company operates the railway under the name Sittingbourne &amp; Kemsley Light Railway (S&amp;KLR).

Freshwater Bay (Western Australia)

Freshwater Bay is a bay of the Swan River, in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. It is about upstream from the mouth of the river at Fremantle and is overlooked by the suburbs of Dalkeith, Claremont, Mosman Park and Peppermint Grove. Freshwater Bay was named after Freshwater Bay and Freshwater, Isle of Wight by Henry Charles Prinsep (1844–1922), who had a riverside family holiday cottage there, "The Chine".
Indigenous context.
Before and after the arrival of Europeans, the bay had significance to local indigenous people.
Features.
Much of the bay's foreshore on the western and eastern sides are limestone cliffs. The head of the bay is the location of the Claremont foreshore.
Other important features to the south are the sand spit at Point Walter and Point Resolution at the eastern end.
Human interaction.
Parts of Freshwater Bay are designated ski areas. Due to Point Walter's spit and the high surrounding limestone cliffs, the bay has relatively calm waters and is protected from winds, making the area suited for jet skiing, rowing, sailing and other water recreations.
Royal Freshwater Bay Yacht Club and Claremont Yacht Club are situated in the bay, both of which provide recreational boat mooring space and other club facilities as well as conducting races.
Christ Church Grammar School and Methodist Ladies' College are also situated atop the limestone cliffs along the northern section of the bay, often using it for rowing training and also kayaking for physical education classes.
Environmental management.
Extensive and long standing environmental impacts of suburban development around the bay have been reviewed following stricter environmental regulation.

County Route 512 (New Jersey)

County Route 512 (CR 512) is a county highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The highway extends from High Bridge Road (CR 513) in Califon to Springfield Avenue (CR 527) / Route 24 in Summit.
Route description.
CR 512 begins at an intersection with CR 513 in Califon, Hunterdon County, heading southeast on two-lane undivided Main Street past homes. Following the crossing the South Branch Raritan River, the route turns south onto Academy Street and makes a turn east into wooded areas. After intersecting Main Street again, CR 512 passes by the J. K. Apgar Farmhouse, an 18th-century stone farmhouse listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
It then becomes Fairmount Road West and heads into Tewksbury Township, where it passes through a mix of farms, woods, and homes. Upon crossing CR 517, CR 512 becomes Fairmount Road East and continues through more rural areas, reaching the residential community of Pottersville.
After crossing the Lamington River, CR 512 enters Bedminster Township in Somerset County and becomes Pottersville Road, heading out of Pottersville and back into areas of farms and woods with a few residences. The road enters Peapack-Gladstone and immediately crosses US 206 in woodland before entering residential areas. CR 512 intersects CR 671 and turns south onto Main Street, passing the Gladstone station, which serves as the western terminus of New Jersey Transit's Gladstone Branch. The road runs to the east of the railroad tracks before turning east and then south at a junction with CR 647. The route continues through a mix of homes and businesses, intersecting CR 661. CR 512 enters a mix of fields and residences before turning southeast and crossing over the Gladstone Branch and heading back into Bedminster Township, at which point it begins running to the west of the North Branch Raritan River through woodland. The route crosses the river into Far Hills and becomes Peapack Drive as it continues through wooded residential areas a short distance to the west of the Gladstone Branch.
CR 512 intersects US 202 and turns northeast to form a concurrency with that route, passing between homes to the northwest and fields to the southeast. CR 512 splits from US 202 near the Far Hills Station by heading southeast on Liberty Corner Road. The route continues through a mix of fields and woods before turning south and then east in a wooded area. The road runs between more fields to the north and woods to the south before turning southeast and passing over I-287. At the Douglas Road intersection, CR 512 enters Bernards Township and heads south through wooded residential areas, making a sharp turn to the east. The route comes to an intersection with CR 640, where it turns south onto Valley Road, passing through woodland and fields. The road turns sharply to the east again and crosses CR 525. The route is briefly a four-lane road past CR 525, narrowing to two lanes at Spring Valley Road. The road passes through a mix of wooded neighborhoods and open fields before turning southeast into forested residential areas at the CR 613 junction. Upon intersecting CR 651, the route makes a turn to the northeast.
After crossing the Passaic River into Long Hill Township in Morris County, CR 512 continues east through suburban neighborhoods and intersects CR 605. Farther east, the road comes into commercial areas and reaches a junction with CR 606. Following this intersection, the route briefly is a divided highway at the entrance to a shopping center before becoming undivided again and passing a mix of homes and businesses. The route comes to a junction with CR 531 and CR 638 before heading northeast into wooded residential neighborhoods and passing over the Gladstone Branch and the Passaic River.
After crossing the Passaic River a second time, CR 512 continues into Berkeley Heights in Union County, becoming Springfield Avenue and passing through business areas with some homes. The road reaches a junction with CR 663 and continues northeast, entering more residential surroundings before it crosses into New Providence. In New Providence, CR 512 comes to an intersection with CR 647 in commercial areas before turning to the east into wooded neighborhoods. The road makes a turn to the northeast and intersects CR 649, at which point CR 512 heads east over the Gladstone Branch near the New Providence station into Summit. In Summit, the road passes more homes before reaching a junction with CR 651, where the route briefly turns southeast onto Morris Avenue before continuing east onto Broad Street into commercial areas. CR 512 intersects CR 657 and passes the entrance to the Summit station on New Jersey Transit's Morris &amp; Essex Lines before turning more to the southeast. The route curves to the northeast and passes through residential neighborhoods. CR 512 comes to its eastern terminus at an interchange with Route 24, with access to Route 124 and CR 527.

Saurabh Kalia

Captain Saurabh Kalia (; – ) was an officer of the Indian Army who was killed during the Kargil War while being held as a prisoner of war by the Pakistan Army. He and five soldiers in his patrol group were captured by Pakistani troops following a gunfight at the Line of Control and tortured prior to their execution.
Early years.
Saurabh Kalia was born on 29 June 1976 in Amritsar, Punjab, India, to Vijaya and N. K. Kalia. He attended D. A. V. Public School in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, and then graduated from Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University in 1997 with a First-Class BSc-Med degree. He won various scholarships throughout his academic career.
Military career.
Saurabh Kalia was selected the Indian Military Academy in August 1997 through the Combined Defence Services Examination and was commissioned on 12 December 1998. He was posted to the 4th battalion Jat Regiment in the Kargil Sector, where he arrived in mid-January 1999 after reporting at the Jat Regimental Centre, Bareilly, on 31 December 1998.
Kargil war.
In the first two weeks of May 1999, several patrols were conducted in the Kaksar Langpa area of Kargil district to see if snow had receded enough for the area to be re-occupied. Kalia, who then held the rank of lieutenant, was the first Indian army officer to observe and report large-scale intrusion of Pakistani Army and foreign mercenaries on the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC) at Kargil, a clear breach of understanding between the two countries. He assumed guard of Bajrang Post at 13,000–14,000 feet to check infiltration in the Kaksar area.
On 15 May 1999, Kalia and five other soldiers – Sepoys Arjun Ram, Bhanwar Lal Bagaria, Bhika Ram, Moola Ram and Naresh Singh of the 4th Jat Regiment - were on a routine patrol of the Bajrang Post in the Kaksar sector in the Ladakh mountains when they engaged in a fierce firefight with Pakistani forces across the LOC eliminating atleast 22-25 Pakistanis before running out of ammunition. They were encircled by a platoon of Pakistani army personnel and were captured before Indian reinforcements could reach them. Radio Skardu of Pakistan announced the capture.
Indian officials stated that Kalia and his men were held captive from May 15, 1999, to June 7, 1999, and were subjected to severe torture. They stated that the evidence of torture was apparent from the injuries on their bodies when they were handed over by the Pakistani Army on June 9, 1999. Post-mortem examinations conducted by India reported that the prisoners variously had cigarette burns, ear-drums pierced with hot rods, many broken teeth and bones, fractured skulls, eyes that had been punctured before being removed, cut lips, chipped noses, and amputated limbs and genitalia. According to the examinations, these injuries preceded the captives being shot dead in the head.
Reaction.
On 15 June 1999, India served Pakistan with a notice of breach of the Geneva Convention for the torture and killing of the prisoners of war. The Minister of External Affairs, Jaswant Singh, raised the issue with Sartaj Aziz, the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, seeking identification and punishment of those responsible, but Pakistan denied the charges of torture.
On 14 December 2012 Pakistan's Interior Minister, Rehman Malik, said that he had just recently heard of the case and that it was not known whether Kalia was killed with a Pakistani bullet or died because of the weather. He also said he would like to meet Kalia's father to find out what exactly had happened with his son. The same day, the Supreme Court of India ordered the Government of India to respond within ten weeks to a petition filed by Kalia's father.
Efforts by family.
Kalia's family has campaigned to have the acts declared a war crime by the United Nations and the people responsible punished in accordance with the Geneva Convention.
Kalia's father approached various national and international organisations to put pressure on Pakistan to identify and punish the persons allegedly responsible. As of 2004, Britain had responded by saying that it had unsuccessfully sought a full report from the Indian army, while Israel noted it had no diplomatic relations with Pakistan. Germany said it had no response to enquiries made to the Ministry of External Affairs, and Pakistan rejected the allegations.
The father stated in 2009 that he has failed to achieve his goals despite 
An online petition started by the father to highlight the plight of the war victims was pursued by the MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar, who wrote to the External Affairs Minister and raised questions in Parliament as to why the Government had not taken up the case with the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). In response, Defence Minister A. K. Antony wrote to Kalia's parents in October 2013 that India was bound by the Simla Agreement, and any differences with Pakistan would be settled bilaterally.
"In order to declare a war crime, the Ministry of Defence needs to write to the Ministry of External Affairs, which then takes up the matter with the UNHRC. The council then refers the matter to the General Assembly, which can declare war crime. It then goes to the international court of justice (ICJ). It is the ministry of external affairs that did not follow up the case with the UN" said Colonel S. K. Aggarwal, a former Judge Advocate General officer. An affidavit filed by the External Affairs ministry in November 2013, said that "moving the ICJ is not a legally enforceable right" and that Pakistan may not permit India submitting a proposal to ICJ.
In 2012, Indian Army Chief General Bikram Singh reportedly supported the efforts of Kalia's father by writing to the Ministry of Defence and National Human Rights Commission conveying his concerns.
N. K. Kalia, along with Chandrasekhar, and the Flags of Honour Foundation, (an organisation dedicated to building ceaseless engagement between society and the families of killed soldiers), filed a petition on 7 December 2012 with Juan E. Méndez, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, of the Office of High Commissioner of Human Rights in Geneva. The Indian External Affairs Ministry said it would look at the nature of the petition, as the UNHRC is an inter-state body and usually acts only in terms of initiatives taken by its member states.
Following the formation of the Narendra Modi ministry, the Supreme Court accepted a public interest litigation (PIL) case in September 2014, filed by N. K. Kalia and Sarwa Mitter, and asked the government to respond within six weeks. The Court wanted to know the stance of the new regime, and wondered why the government had not approached the International Court of Justice. The government's reply listed the actions taken by the previous government but did not state any proposals for the future. Instead, the government challenged the validity of the petition, saying that a PIL cannot seek action against a foreign country and that foreign policy is a government function.
Memorials.
In Himachal Pradesh, a memorial park in Palampur is named "Saurabh Van Vihar", a street as "Capt Saurabh Kalia Marg" and the locality as "Saurabh Nagar". A statue in his memory has been erected in Amritsar by Amritsar Working Journalists Association. A liquefied petroleum gas agency has been allotted by the Indian Oil Corporation to his parents.

The agriculture land use pattern has shifted from sugarcane to other cash crops like tobacco and traditional food crops and vegetables.
Goraul has immense potential as a centre for horticulture and agro-processing (fruit pulp) industries. The entire region is dotted with plantations of
1) Mango - delicious local varieties which are increasingly getting lost in targeted marketing campaigns of alphonso and dussehri
2) Lychee - amazing varieties which lose much of their temper in transportation and need to be tasted straight from the plantations
3) Betel leaf - which is considered to be an addiction (when taken with tobacco) and as a digestive when taken with cardamom and cloves.
4) Banana - amazing varieties of banana can be found here. The area is filled with banana trees.
Demographics.
As per the 2001 census, Goraul block had a population of 135,502.

Glenelg Oval

Glenelg Oval (also known as Stratarama Stadium due to naming rights) is a sports venue located on Brighton Road, Glenelg East, South Australia. 
The ground is primarily used for Australian rules football and cricket and is the home ground for the Glenelg Football Club in the SANFL competition. It is also the home of the Glenelg Cricket Club, and hosts local school football matches, with the Glenelg Primary School located beyond the southern end of the ground. with one seated grandstand holding 1,000 and a new grass area where the old HY Sparkes Stand was with umbrellas holding 500.
History.
The oval has a current capacity of 15,000 and the entire spectator area on the western or Brighton Road side of the ground is concrete terracing. This is also where the former 500-seat HY Sparkes Stand and the 1,000-seat Edward Rix Stand, as well as the Glenelg Cricket Club, are located. The Glenelg Football Club offices, bars and function rooms are located under the Rix Stand. The entire outer side of the ground, which extends from goal to goal, consists only of grass banking which is less than five-metres wide on the outer wing. The area in front of the southern end of the Rix Stand is also where the Glenelg cheer squad stands for games, near the female and opposition change rooms and current home-team players race. This is the former location of the Snouts Bar, now situated near the new electronic scoreboard located where the old scoreboard stood. At only 160m x 115m, Glenelg Oval is among the smallest playing surfaces in the SANFL.
The ground record attendance was set on 20 July 1968 when 17,171 saw Sturt defeat Glenelg by just one point, 13.13 (91) to 13.12 (90).
Glenelg Oval saw the highest score kicked by any team in SANFL history when Glenelg defeated Central District 49.23 (317) to 11.13 (79) in round 18 of the 1975 SANFL season. The 228-point winning margin was an SANFL record at the time. Tigers champion full-forward D.K. "Fred" Phillis, a Magarey Medal winner for the Bays in 1969, kicked a Glenelg club record 18 goals in the match. Other stars for Glenelg on that famous day included Graham Cornes, Peter Carey, Peter Marker and John McFarlane. Late in the last quarter, McFarlane, who had kicked almost 10 goals for the game, had a shot on goal that would have been the Tigers 50th. The ball hit the post though and was recorded as a point (in Australian football, if a kicked ball hits the goal posts, even if it then bounces through the goals untouched by any player or bounces back into play, the ball is dead and a point is awarded to the attacking team).
In 2009, the oval was renamed to Gliderol Stadium @ Glenelg as part of a sponsorship arrangement between the football club and its major sponsor, Gliderol Garage Doors. Previously, the ground was named Challenge Recruitment Oval under sponsorship with employment agency Challenge Recruitment.
On 28 December 2016, Adelaide was hit by wild storms with heavy rain and high winds. The winds caused damage to Glenelg Oval with the roof of the HY Sparkes Stand blown off into the oval's car park.
On 1 November 2018, Glenelg Oval was renamed ACH Group Stadium as part of a partnership between the football club and co-tenant ACH Group. In November 2022, the oval was renamed Stratarama Stadium as part of a new sponsorship deal for the 2023 season and beyond.
Glenelg Oval hosted the highest ever partnership in Sheffield Shield cricket on 1 November 2020, with Victorian openers Will Pucovski and Marcus Harris combining for 486 runs for the first-wicket stand in a match between South Australia and Victoria.
Lights.
After a long legal battle with local residents which resulted in a court win for the Tigers, the Glenelg Football Club had lights installed at the oval in time for the 2012 SANFL season. On 31 March the club christened their newly lit home ground with an 11.13 (79) to 7.15 (57) win over West Adelaide in front of 6,047 fans.
The record night game attendance at Glenelg Oval was set on 25 April (Anzac Day) during Round 4 of the 2014 SANFL season when 9,299 fans saw Glenelg record its first win of the season by defeating the Adelaide Crows SANFL team 17.21 (123) to 13.8 (86).
Interstate football.
On Saturday 26 May 2012, Glenelg Oval hosted its first ever Interstate game when South Australia defeated Western Australia by 14 points 15.11 (101) to 13.9 (87). Scores were locked at 11.8 (74) each at three-quarter time, but the Croweaters scored 4.3 (27) to 2.1 (13) in the last quarter to win in front of a disappointing crowd of just 2,843, not helped by predicted rain. The teams were playing for the Haydn Bunton, Jr. Trophy.
Cricket.
The venue is used by the Glenelg Cricket Club in the South Australian Grade Cricket League. In October 2013, the venue hosted a Sheffield Shield match, due to the redevelopment of the Adelaide Oval not being completed in time for the start of the season; it was the first Shield match which South Australia has ever hosted away from Adelaide Oval.
On 26 February 2014, the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA) announced that should the Southern Redbacks win the right to host the 2013–14 Sheffield Shield final, scheduled for 21–25 March 2014, the game would be played at Glenelg Oval rather than the Redback's long-time home, the Adelaide Oval. This was due to a date clash as the oval had been pre-booked for a Rolling Stones concert on 22 March. While the SACA was applauded for announcing the venue change early, there was outrage among the Adelaide public that the oval's longest tenants had been forced out due to a one-off rock concert (the South Australian cricket team has been the major tenant of the Adelaide Oval since 1877). State Government Minister for Infrastructure Tom Koutsantonis also came in for heavy criticism for stating in an interview on radio station FiveAA that the state Labour party had always seen the newly renovated Adelaide Oval as an economic asset and that the stadium was not just about sport.
In a sad twist, the Rolling Stones concert at the Adelaide Oval was postponed due to the death of L'Wren Scott, the partner of lead singer Mick Jagger. Additionally, the Redbacks suffered a late-season form slump and failed to reach the Sheffield Shield final.
In 2016, the Glenelg oval hosted the Sheffield Shield final between South Australia and Victoria due to the Adelaide Oval being unavailable.

Hajnal is best known for identifying, in a landmark 1965 paper, the historical pattern of marriage of northwest Europe in which people married late and many adults remained single. The geographical boundary of this unusual marriage pattern is now known as the Hajnal line.
Biography.
Hajnal was born on 26 November 1924, in Darmstadt, at the time the capital of the People's State of Hesse in Weimar Germany, to a Hungarian Jewish family. In 1936, his parents left Nazi Germany, and placed him in a Quaker school in the Dutch countryside while they arranged to settle in Britain. In 1937, John was reunited with his parents in London, where he attended University College School, Hampstead.
At age 16, he entered Balliol College, Oxford. He gained a first there in economics, philosophy and politics in 1943. His skills in academic-level mathematics were mostly autodidactical.
After the war, Hajnal worked on demography for the United Nations in New York, and later for the Office of Population Research, Princeton University.
He met Berlin-born Nina Lande in New York. They were married from 1950 until her death in 2008 and had three daughters and a son.
Returning to the United Kingdom, he worked at Manchester University as a statistician from 1953. The family moved to London in 1956, when John was assured a lectureship at the London School of Economics. He was Professor of Statistics at the London School of Economics from 1975 until his retirement in 1986. He died on 30 November 2008, aged 84, in London.

Love Bites (TV series)

Love Bites is an American anthology comedy-drama television series originally planned for the 2010–11 television season on the NBC network that eventually aired as a summer replacement series. It premiered in its regular Thursday night time slot at 10:00 pm Eastern/9:00 pm Central, on June 2, 2011. On July 11, 2011, NBC canceled the show and the series finale aired on July 21, 2011.
Plot.
"Love Bites" was originally set to focus on "optimistic, bubbly social worker" Annie (Becki Newton) and "sarcastic career bridesmaid" Frannie (Jordana Spiro),two single women exploring modern stories of dating, marriage, love, and sex, while dealing with their other married friends.
Due to off-camera complications, the show was retooled as an anthology series focusing on multiple vignettes per episode. Each story was loosely connected by common themes or romantically-challenged characters related to the pilot's three main protagonists: Annie (Becki Newton), Judd (Greg Grunberg), and Colleen (Constance Zimmer/Pamela Adlon).
Development and production.
In January 2010, NBC announced "Love Bites" as one of many pilots on its early development slate. Becki Newton was cast in late February, followed quickly by Jordana Spiro. Marc Buckland was confirmed to be directing the pilot in early March. In May 2010, NBC announced it had green-lit the series. The series was scheduled to air on Thursday nights in the 10–11 pm slot starting in the fall of 2010. On May 17, 2010, Greg Grunberg announced via Twitter that he will be joining the cast.
A number of changes eventually prevented the series from going into production as planned. On June 24, 2010, Spiro left the series after 3 episodes due to her contracted role on "My Boys". Krysten Ritter guest starred in the pilot episode as Cassie, replacing Spiro. Due to Newton's announced pregnancy, her character, a virgin, was reimagined, and prior to production, showrunner Cindy Chupack voluntarily reduced her role to writer, citing personal reasons. NBC moved "Love Bites" to midseason 2010–11 and moved "The Apprentice" to fall 2010 to take the timeslot. Pamela Adlon was originally cast as Colleen in the unaired pilot and was replaced by Constance Zimmer in the subsequent aired episodes. In July 2010, Ink UMS announced that Tracy Poust and Jon Kinnally would serve as writing showrunners for the series.
On December 9, 2010, "Deadline Hollywood" reported that NBC had cut back the episode order from 13 to 9 episodes. NBC's subsequent cancellation for the cult series led to new pilot choices by Spiro at "Lost and Found", Newton at an untitled Jackie and Jeff Filgo CBS pilot and Grunberg landing at "Big Mike".
After numerous delays, NBC announced that the 9 completed episodes were to premiere on June 2, 2011.

<doc id="6959249" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6959249" title="History of the Jews in Syria">
History of the Jews in Syria

The history of the Jews in Syria goes back to ancient times. They were joined by Sephardim who fled after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Portugal in 1492 CE. There were large Jewish communities in Aleppo, Damascus, and Qamishli for centuries. In the early 20th century, a large percentage of Syrian Jews immigrated to British Mandate-Palestine(Israel), the U.S. and Latin America.
Following the Syrian Civil War, some of the remaining Jews of Syria left the country. In 2022, it was alleged that only four Jews remain in Damascus. As of April 4 2025, there are approximately six remaining Jews in Damascus.
Second Temple period.
The tradition of the community ascribes its founding to the time of King David in c. 1000 BCE, whose general Joab occupied the area of Syria, described in the Bible as "Aram Zoba": this name is taken by later tradition as referring to Aleppo. Modern scholarship locates Aram Zoba in Lebanon and the far south of Syria: the identification with Aleppo is not found in rabbinic literature prior to the 11th century. Whether or not Jewish settlement goes back to a time as early as King David, both Aleppo and Damascus certainly had Jewish communities during Late Antiquity.
In Roman times, about 10,000 Jews lived in Damascus, governed by an ethnarch.
Around 7 BCE, King Herod of Judaea relocated Zamaris, a Jew from Babylonia, and his 500 mounted archers to "Bathyra" in Batanea, giving them tax exemptions to defend the area from Trachonite brigands and protect Jewish pilgrims heading to Jerusalem.
Paul of Tarsus succeeded, after a first rebuff, in converting many of the Jews of Damascus to Christianity in 49 CE. This irritated the Jewish ethnarch to such a degree that he attempted to arrest Paul; the latter's friends only saved his life by lowering him in a basket out of a window built into the wall of the city.
In the 70s CE, Jewish historian Josephus noted that "the Jewish race, while dispersed in considerable numbers among native populations throughout the world, is especially numerous in Syria, because of its proximity." Many Jews were murdered by the pagan inhabitants upon the outbreak of the First Jewish–Roman War.
Late Antiquity.
Later, Damascus, as the coins show, obtained the title of metropolis, and under Alexander Severus, when the city was a Christian colony, it became the seat of a bishop, who enjoyed a rank next to that of the Patriarch of Antioch. In the 5th century, under the rule of the Byzantine Empire, being the Talmudic time, Jews were living at Damascus for the rabbi Rafram bar Pappa went to pray in the synagogue of Jobar.
An early Jewish community is likely to have existed in Aleppo during the 5th century, when a synagogue was constructed there. Also in the 5th century, Jerome reports the presence in Beroea (Aleppo) of a congregation of Nazarenes (Jewish Christians) using a Hebrew gospel similar to that of Matthew.
During the early 7th century, Jews in Damascus participated in revolts against Byzantine rule, including support for the rebellion in Tyre. Estimates suggest that on the eve of the Islamic conquest, the Jewish population of Damascus may have numbered between 6,000 and 8,000.
After the Islamic conquest.
Damascus.
According to Arabic-language source, Caliph ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb negotiated a treaty with the Jews of Jerusalem at Jabiyah, near Damascus, reportedly at the urging of Syrian Jews, indicating a close connection between these communities.
The rule of the Umayyads brought a new period of splendor to the city, which now became the capital of that caliphate. This period ended with the rise of the Abbasids, and the city suffered during the following centuries from continuous wars. The Jewish community continued, and certainly existed in 970; "for," says a historian, "Joseph ben Abitur of Cordoba, having lost all hope of becoming the chief rabbi of that city, went to Palestine in that year, and settled at Damascus". Fortunately for the Jews, it resisted the siege of the Second Crusade in 1147. Some time afterward a large number of Palestinian Jews sought refuge in Damascus from the enormous taxes imposed upon them by the Crusaders, thus increasing the community in Damascus. Little information exists concerning the Jews in Damascus during the following centuries. A little information is given by travelers who visited the city. In 1128, Abraham ibn Ezra visited Damascus (though compare the note of Harkavy.) According to Edelmann, Judah ha-Levi composed his famous poem on Zion in this city; but Harkavy has shown that "ash-Sham" here designates Palestine and not Damascus. In 1267, Nahmanides visited Damascus and led a Jewish colony to Jerusalem.
Benjamin of Tudela visited Damascus in 1170, while it was in the hands of the Seljukian prince Nur ad-Din Zangi. He found there 3,000 Rabbanite Jews and 100 Karaites. Jewish studies flourished there much more than in Palestine; according to Bacher it is possible that during the 12th century the seat of the Palestinian academy was transferred to Damascus. The principal rabbis of the city were Rabbi Ezra ben Abraham and his brother Sar Shalom ben Abraham, president of the tribunal; Yussef ִHamsi, R. Matsliaִh, R. Meïr, Yussef ibn Piat, R. Heman, the parnas, and R. Tsadok, physician.
About the same time, Petaִhiah of Regensburg was there. He found "about 10,000 Jews, who have a prince. The head of their academy is Rabbi Ezra, who is full of the knowledge of the Law; for Rabbi Samuel, the head of the Academy of Babylon, ordained him". It was a Damascus rabbi, Judah ben Josiah, who, toward the end of the twelfth century, was "nagid" in Egypt. At a later period another nagid, David ben Joshua, also came from Damascus.
In 1210, a French Jew, Samuel ben Samson, visited the city. He speaks of the beautiful synagogue situated outside the city (Jobar) and said to have been constructed by Elisha.
Under Saladin the city again enjoyed considerable importance; but upon his death the disturbances began anew, until in 1516 the city fell into the hands of the Turks, since which time it has declined to the rank of a provincial town.
It seems probable that Yehuda Alharizi also visited Damascus during the first decade of the 13th century. At least he mentions the city in the celebrated 46th "Makamah."
Toward the end of the 13th century Jesse ben Hezekiah, a man full of energy, arose in Damascus. He was recognized by Sultan Qalawun of Egypt as prince and exilarch, and in 1289 and in June 1290, in conjunction with his 12 colleagues, he put the anti-Maimonists under the ban.
The letters of the rabbis of Damascus and of Acre have been collected in the "Minִhat Qena'ot " (a compilation made by Abba Mari, grandson of Don Astruc of Lunel). No information is available for the 14th century. Estori Farִhi (1313) contents himself with the mere mention of Damascene Jews journeying to Jerusalem. A manuscript of David Kimhi on Ezekiel was written by Nathan of Narbonne and collated with the original by R. ִHiyya in Damascus, Ab 18, 1375. The Jewish community of Damascus continued to exist under the sultans (Burjites and Mamelukes) of Egypt, who conquered Syria; for the Jewish refugees of Spain established themselves among their coreligionists in that city in 1492, constructing a synagogue which they called "Khata'ib." The anonymous author of the "Yiִhus ha-Abot" also speaks of the beauties of Damascus; and of the synagogue at Jobar, "half of which was constructed by Elisha, half by Eleazar ben Arach".
Elijah of Ferrara in 1438 had come to Jerusalem and had a certain jurisdiction in rabbinical matters over Damascus as well. He speaks of a great plague which devastated Egypt, Syria, and Jerusalem; but he does not say how much the Jews of Damascus suffered. Menaִhem ִHayyim of Volterra visited Damascus in 1481, and found 450 Jewish families, "all rich, honored, and merchants." The head of the community was a certain R. Joseph, a physician.
Obadiah of Bertinoro in 1488 speaks in one of his letters of the riches of the Jews in Damascus, of the beautiful houses and gardens. A few years later, in 1495, an anonymous traveler speaks in like eulogistic terms. He lived with a certain Moses Makran, and he relates that the Jews in Damascus dealt in dress-goods or engaged in some handicraft. They lent money to the Venetians at 24% interest.
Aleppo.
Maimonides, in his letter to the rabbis of Lunel, speaks of Aleppo as being the only community in Syria where some Torah learning survived, though the effort devoted to it was in his opinion less than impressive.
Benjamin of Tudela visited Aleppo in 1173, where he found a Jewish community of 1,500 (or on another reading 5,000) souls with three noteworthy rabbis attending to their spiritual needs: Moses Alconstantini, Israel, and Seth. Petaִhiah of Regensburg was there between 1170 and 1180, and Alִharizi fifty years later. The former calls the citadel the palace of King Nour-ed-din, and says that there were 1,500 Jews in Aleppo, of whom the chief men were Rabbis Moses Alconstantini, Israel, and Seth. Yehuda Alharizi, author of the "Taִhkemoni" has much to say in praise of the Aleppo Jews. In 1195 the leading Jew was Joseph ben Judah, who had migrated from the Maghreb by way of Egypt, where he was the friend of Maimonides, who wrote for him the Guide for the Perplexed. Other men of learning were Azariah and his brother Samuel Nissim, the king's physician Eleazer, Jeshua, Jachin Hananiah, and Joseph ben ִHisdai. Although he respected them far more than their Damascene counterparts, Alharizi thought little of the Aleppo poets, of whom he mentions Moses Daniel and a certain Joseph; the best was Joseph ben Tsemah, who had good qualities but wrote bad verse. Their piety must have been extreme, for Eleazer is held up to scorn for having traveled on the Sabbath, although at the sultan's command. Alharizi died in Aleppo and was buried there.
In 1260 the Mongols conquered Aleppo, and massacred many of the inhabitants, but many of the Jews took refuge in the synagogue and were saved. In 1401 the Jewish quarter was pillaged, with the rest of the city, by Tamerlane; and a Jewish saint died there after a fast of seven months.
Homs.
Jews reportedly participated in the defense of Homs against a Byzantine reconquest.
Early Modern period.
Arrival of Spanish Jews in Syria.
After the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, Sephardi Jews settled in many of the Islamic countries bordering the Mediterranean, including Syria, which then formed part of the Mameluke sultanate of Egypt. For the most part they founded their own communities, but they often assumed positions of rabbinic and communal leadership in their new homes. A social distinction remained between the newly arrived Sephardim and the native communities, the Musta'arabi Jews, which took several decades to accept them. Aleppo Jews of Spanish descent have a special custom, not found elsewhere, of lighting an extra candle at Hanukkah: it is said that this custom was established in gratitude for their acceptance by the local community. In both Aleppo and Damascus, the two communities supported a common Chief Rabbinate. Chief Rabbis were usually but not always from Spanish-descended families: in Aleppo there were five in a row from the Laniado family.
The Sephardic presence was greater in Aleppo than in Damascus which maintained closer ties to the Holy Land. In particular, the Damascus community was strongly influenced by the Safed Kabbalistic school of Isaac Luria, and contributed several notable personalities, including ִHayim Vital and Israel Najara. This explains certain differences in customs between the two cities.
Captain Domingo de Toral, who visited Aleppo in 1634, mentions over 800 houses of Jews who spoke Castilian. An anonymous Jewish traveler who arrived a few years after the Spanish immigration, found at Damascus 500 Jewish households; also a Karaite community whose members called themselves "Muallim-Tsadaqah"; and a more important Rabbanite community, composed of three groups and possessing three beautiful synagogues. One of these belonged to the Sephardim; another, to the Moriscos (Moorish Jews) or natives; and the third, to the Sicilians. In each synagogue there was a preacher, who read the works of Maimonides to the pious every day after the prayer. The preacher of the Sephardim was Isִhaq Mas'ud, that of the natives Shem-ִTob al-Furani, and that of the Sicilians Isaac ִHaber. There were also two small schools for young students of the Talmud, containing respectively thirty and forty pupils.
Sixty Jewish families were living in the village of Jobar, from Damascus, who had a very beautiful synagogue. "I have never seen anything like it," says the author; "it is supported by thirteen columns. Tradition says that it dates from the time of the prophet Elisha, and that he here anointed King Hazael. R. Eleazar ben Arach (a tannaite of the 1st century) repaired this synagogue." In order to indicate, finally, that the city was even then under the Ottoman rule, the narrator adds that the people of Damascus had just received a governor ("na'ib") from Constantinople.
Under the Ottoman Empire.
In 1515 Selim I defeated the Mamelukes and Syria became part of the Ottoman Empire.
The "Chronicle" of Joseph Sambari (finished 1672) contains the names of a number of rabbis of note who lived in Damascus during the 16th century. He says that the Jewish community lived chiefly in Jobar, and he knows of the synagogue of Elisha (Central Synagogue of Aleppo) and the cave of Elijah the Tishbite. At the head of the community was a certain Abu ִHatseirah (so-called from a peculiar kind of headdress which he wore), who was followed by 'Abd Allah ibn Naִsir. Of the rabbis of Damascus proper he mentions Joseph ִHayyaִt; Samuel Aripol, author of "Mizmor le-Todah"; Samuel ibn 'Imran; Joseph al-ִSa'iִh; Moses Najara, author of "Lekaִh ִTob"; ִHayim Alshaich; Joseph Maִtalon; Abraham Galante. In this home of learning there was also a model-codex of the Bible called "Al-Taj" (the Crown). In 1547 Pierre Belon visited Damascus in the train of the French ambassador M. de Fumel. He speaks of the large number of Jews there; but makes the singular confusion of placing in this city the events connected with the famous Ahmad Shaitan of Egypt.
Among the spiritual leaders of Damascus in the 16th century may be mentioned: Jacob Berab, who, in the interval between his sojourns in Egypt and at Safed, lived there for some years (c. 1534); ִHayim Vital the Calabrian (1526–1603), for many years chief rabbi of Damascus, and the author of various cabalistic works, including "Etz ִHayim"; Samuel ben David the Karaite (not "Jemsel," as Eliakim Carmoly has it), who visited Damascus in 1641, mentions the circumstance that the Karaites there do not read the Haftarah after the Pentateuch section. Moses Najara; his son, the poet Israel Najara; Moses Galante (died in 1608), the son of Mordecai Galante; and Samuel Laniado ben Abraham of Aleppo were also among the prominent men of the 16th century.
The most celebrated rabbis of the 17th century were Josiah Pinto, a pupil of Jacob Abulafia, and author of the "Kesef-Nibִhar", and his son-in-law, Samuel Vital, who transcribed and circulated a large number of his father's Kabbalistic manuscripts. At the same time in Aleppo ִHayyim Cohen ben Abraham wrote "Meqor ִHayyim", published at Constantinople in 1649, and at Amsterdam by Menasseh ben Israel in 1650. Other Aleppo worthies are Samuel Dwek and Isaac Lopes in 1690 followed by Yehudah Kassin, Isaac Berachah and Isaac Atieh in the 18th century.
From the 17th to the 19th century, several Jews of Spanish and Italian origin settled in Syria for trading reasons. Whenever possible, they kept their European nationality in order to be under the jurisdiction of the consular courts under the Ottoman capitulations, rather than being treated as "dhimmis" under Islamic law. These European Jews were known as "Señores Francos" (Frank Lords) and maintained a sense of social superiority to the native Jews, both "Musta'arabi" and Sephardi. They did not form separate synagogues, but often held services of their own in private houses. There were also Jews of Baghdadi origin who claimed British nationality through family connections in India.
Some information is obtainable from travellers who visited Damascus during the 19th century. Alfred von Kremer, in "Mittel-Syrien und Damaskus" (1853), states that in the municipal government of the city two Christians and one Jew had places; the number of Jews was 4,000, only 1,000 of whom, however, paid the poll-tax; the last Karaite had died there some fifty years previously, the Karaite synagogue being then sold to the Greeks, who turned it into a church. The traveller Benjamin II gives the same number of inhabitants. He describes the synagogue at Jobar (to the north-east of the city) thus:"The structure of this ancient building reminds one of the Mosque Moawiah; the interior is supported by 13 marble pillars, six on the right and seven on the left side, and is everywhere inlaid with marble. There is only one portal by which to enter. Under the holy shrine . . . is a grotto . . . the descent to which is by a flight of about 20 steps. According to the Jews, the Prophet Elisha is said to have found in this grotto a place of refuge. . . . At the entrance of the synagogue, toward the middle of the wall to the right, is an irregularly formed stone, on which can be observed the traces of several steps. Tradition asserts that upon this step sat King Hazael when the Prophet Elisha anointed him king."Benjamin II also speaks of valuable copies of parts of the Bible to be found in Damascus; though the dates he gives (581 and 989) are unreliable. Neubauer mentions a copy of the Bible which belonged to Elisha ben Abraham ben Benvenisti, called "Crescas," and which was finished in 1382.
Damascus had eight chief rabbis during the 19th century, namely: (1) Joseph David Abulafia (1809–16). (2) Jacob Antebi (1816–1833). (3) Jacob Perez (1833–48). (4) Aaron Bagdadi (1848–66). (During the next two years the office of chief rabbi was vacant, owing to internal quarrels.) (5) ִHayim Qimִhi of Constantinople (1868–72). (6) Mercado Kilִhi of Nish (1872–76). (7) Isaac ben Moses Abulafia (1876–88). (8) Solomon Eliezer Alfandari, commonly called "Mercado Alfandari" of Constantinople, who was appointed by an imperial decree in 1888 (still in office in 1901). A more recent chief rabbi was Nissim Indibo, who died at the end of 1972. Other Damascus Rabbis are Mordechai Maslaton, Shaul Menaged and Zaki Assa.
During the 19th, century the Jews of Damascus were several times made the victims of calumnies, the gravest being those of 1840 and 1860, in the reign of the sultan Abdülmecit I. That of 1840, commonly known as the Damascus affair, was an accusation of ritual murder brought against the Jews in connection with the death of Father Thomas. The libel resulted in the arrest and torture of senior members of the Jewish community, as well as the kidnapping of 63 children ages three to ten in an attempt to coerce a confession from their parents. The second accusation brought against the Jews, in 1860, was that of having taken part in the massacre of the Christians by the Druze and the Muslims. Five hundred Muslims, who had been involved in the affair, were hanged by the grand vizier Fuad Pasha. Two hundred Jews were awaiting the same fate, in spite of their innocence, and the whole Jewish community had been fined 4,000,000 piastres. The condemned Jews were saved only by the official intervention of Fuad Pasha himself; that of the Prussian consul, Dr. Johann G. Wetzstein; of Sir Moses Montefiore of London, and of the bankers Abraham Salomon Camondo of Constantinople and Shemaya Angel of Damascus. From that time to the end of the 19th century, several further blood accusations were brought against the Jews; these, however, never provoked any great excitement.
Prominent Aleppo rabbis include Eliahu Shamah, Abraham Antebi and Mordechai Labaton in the 19th century, Jacob Saul Dwek who died in 1919, followed by Ezra Hamwi and Moses Mizrahi who was prepared to be burnt with the Torah Scrolls but was removed by the Arab mob from the Jamilieh Synagogue during the pogrom of 1947. He was followed by Moses Tawil, Shlomo Zafrani and Yomtob Yedid.
In the 19th century, the commercial importance of Aleppo and Damascus underwent a marked decline. Beginning around 1850, and with increasing frequency until the First World War, many families left Syria for Egypt, and later moved from there to Manchester in England, often following the cotton trade. Later still a considerable number left Manchester for Latin America, in particular Mexico and Argentina.
Jews continued to emigrate from Syria into the early 20th century. From around 1908, many Syrian Jews migrated to New York City, where the Brooklyn community is now the world's largest single Syrian Jewish community.
French Mandate and independence era.
With anti-Jewish feeling reaching a climax in the late 1930s and early 1940s, many Jews considered emigrating. Between 1942 and 1947, around 4,500 Jews arrived in Palestine from Syria and Lebanon. From 1945 to 1948, about 1,300 Syrian Jewish children were smuggled into Palestine.
On 17 April 1946, Syria became independent from France. After independence, the Syrian government banned Jewish emigration to Palestine, and those caught trying to leave faced the death penalty or imprisonment with hard labor. Severe restrictions were also placed on the teaching of Hebrew in Jewish schools.
In 1947, there were 15,000 Jews in Syria. On November 29, 1947, the United Nations approved a Partition Plan for Palestine, which included an independent Jewish state. Pogroms subsequently broke out in Damascus and Aleppo. The December 1947 pogrom in Aleppo in particular left the community devastated; 75 Jews were killed, hundreds were injured, and more than 200 Jewish homes, shops, and synagogues were destroyed.
Thousands of Syrian Jews illegally escaped to Palestine following these attacks.
In August 1949, the Menarsha synagogue grenade attack in Damascus killed 12 Jews, and injured dozens.
Post-1948.
In 1948, Israel was created as a Jewish state and defeated an Arab coalition that involved Syria during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During that war, the Syrian Army invaded the Galilee, but its advance was stopped, and the Syrians were pushed back to the Golan Heights.
Despite an exodus to Israel or other countries of Jews that occurred throughout the Muslim world, Syrian Jews were not officially expelled. But after Israeli independence in 1948, the situation for Syrian Jews deteriorated once again. The Aleppo Arab riot of 1947 killed dozens of Jews and destroyed hundreds of homes, shops, and shuls. This marked the beginning of mass Jewish emigration from Syria to Israel, despite the Syrian government's willingness to put to death those who attempted to flee. Other repressive measures against Jews included barring them from government service, not allowing them to own telephones or driver's licenses, and forbidding them to buy property. The anti-Semitic attitude of Syria's government was displayed to the world when it provided shelter for Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner, an aide to Adolf Eichmann. Initially, Lebanon allowed Syrian Jews escaping to Israel free passage through its territory. This ended when the Syrian government began confiscating the passports of Jews, and Lebanon announced that it could not allow persons through its borders without travel documents. Between 1948 and 1961, about 5,000 Syrian Jews managed to reach Israel. Many Syrian Jews also immigrated to Lebanon, but a few were deported back to Syria upon the Syrian government's request. The Syrian Jews in Lebanon, along with the rest of the Lebanese Jewish community, would largely leave that country for Israel, Europe, and the Americas in later years.
The Syrian government passed a number of restrictive laws against the Jewish minority. In 1948, the government banned the sale of Jewish property. In 1953, all Jewish bank accounts were frozen. Jewish property was confiscated, and Jewish homes which had been taken from their owners were used to house Palestinian refugees.
In 1954, the Syrian government temporarily lifted the ban on Jewish emigration; Jews who left had to leave all their property to the government. After the first group of Jewish emigrants left for Turkey in November 1954, emigration was swiftly banned again. In 1958, when Syria joined the United Arab Republic, Jewish emigration was temporarily permitted again, again on condition that those leaving relinquish all their property, but it was soon prohibited again. In 1959, people accused of helping Jews escape Syria were brought to trial.
In March 1964, a new decree banned Jews from traveling more than from their hometowns. Jews were not allowed to work for the government or banks, could not acquire drivers' licenses, and were banned from purchasing property. Jews could not choose to have their heirs inherit their property, with the government confiscating the property of all Jews upon their deaths. Although Jews were prohibited from leaving the country, they were sometimes allowed to travel abroad for commercial or medical reasons. Any Jew granted clearance to leave the country had to leave behind a bond of $300–$1,000 and family members to be used as hostages to ensure they returned. An airport road was paved over the Jewish cemetery in Damascus, and Jewish schools were closed and handed over to Muslims. The Jewish Quarter of Damascus was under constant surveillance by the secret police, who were present at synagogue services, weddings, bar mitzvahs, and other Jewish gatherings. The secret police closely monitored contact between Syrian Jews and foreigners and kept a file on every member of the Jewish community. Jews also had their phones tapped and their mail read by the secret police.
After Israel's victory in the 1967 Six-Day War, restrictions were further tightened, and 57 Jews in Qamishli were allegedly killed in a pogrom. The Jewish communities in Damascus, Aleppo, and Qamishli were under house arrest for eight months following the war. Many Jewish workers were laid off following the Six-Day War.
As a result, Syrian Jews began escaping clandestinely, and supporters abroad helped smuggle Jews out of Syria. Syrian Jews already living abroad often bribed officials to help Jews escape. Judy Feld Carr, a Canadian-Jewish activist, helped smuggle 3,228 Jews out of Syria to Israel, the United States, Canada, and Latin America. Carr recalled that Syrian-Jewish parents were "desperate" to get their children out of the country. Those who were caught attempting to escape faced execution or forced labor. If an escape was successful, family members could be imprisoned and stripped of their property. Often with the help of smugglers, escapees attempted to sneak across the border into Lebanon or Turkey, where they were met and assisted by undercover Israeli agents or local Jewish communities. Most escapees were young and single men. Many single men decided to put off marriage until they escaped, as they wanted to raise their children in freedom. As a result, the ratio of single men and women became heavily imbalanced, and Syrian Jewish women were often unable to find husbands. In 1977, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, as a gesture to US President Jimmy Carter, began allowing limited numbers of young women to leave the country, and some 300 left in total under this program.
In 1970, the Israeli government began receiving intelligence of the situation Jews faced in Syria, and the efforts of many Jewish youths to flee in spite of the danger. That year, Israel launched Operation Blanket, a series of individual attempts to bring Jews to Israel, during which Israeli naval commandos and Mossad operatives made dozens of incursions into Syria. The operation only succeeded in bringing a few dozen young Jews to Israel. During a 10-year period in the 1980s, a collection of Jewish holy objects was smuggled out of Syria through the efforts of Chief Rabbi Avraham Hamra. The collection included nine bible manuscripts, each between 700 and 900 years old, 40 Torah scrolls, and 32 decorative boxes where the Torahs were held. The items were taken to Israel and placed in the Jewish National and University Library of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
In 1973 Zaki Katzav, a Zionist activist, who was murdered at the entrance to his home, was recognized by the State of Israel as a martyr.
On 14 April 1974, four Jewish girls were raped, murdered and mutilated after attempting to flee to Israel. Their bodies were discovered by border police in a cave in the Zabdani Mountains northwest of Damascus along with the remains of two Jewish boys, Natan Shaya, 18 and Kassem Abadi 20, victims of an earlier massacre. Syrian authorities deposited the bodies of all six in sacks before the homes of their parents in the Jewish quarter of Damascus.
In 1975, President Hafez al-Assad explained why he refused to allow Jewish emigration: "I cannot let them go, because if I let them go how can I stop the Soviet Union sending its Jews to Israel, where they will strengthen my enemy?"
As a result of mainly clandestine emigration, the Syrian Jewish population declined. In 1957, there were only 5,300 Jews left in Syria, out of an original population of 15,000 in 1947. In 1968, it was estimated that there were 4,000 Jews still in Syria.In January 1984, a pregnant Jewish woman and her two young children were murdered in Aleppo
In November 1989, the Syrian government agreed to facilitate the emigration of 500 single Jewish women, who greatly outnumbered eligible Jewish men. During the 1991 Madrid peace conference, the United States pressured Syria to ease restriction on its Jewish population following heavy lobbying from Americans of Syrian-Jewish descent. As a result, Syria lifted many restrictions on its Jewish community, and allowed Jews to leave on condition that they not immigrate to Israel. Beginning on the Passover Holiday of 1992, 4,000 remaining members of the Damascus Jewish community (Arabic "Yehud ash-Sham") as well as the Aleppo community and the Jews of Qamishli, were granted exit permits. Within a few months, thousands of Syrian Jews left for the United States, France or Turkey with the help of philanthropic leaders of the Syrian Jewish community. Some 300 remained in Syria, most of them elderly.
Of the Syrian Jews who left for the United States, 1,262 were brought to Israel in a two-year covert operation. Most of them settled in Tel Aviv, Holon, and Bat Yam. More than 2,400 others stayed in the U.S. and settled in New York. Israel initially kept the news of their emigration censored, fearing that it would imperil the rights of the remaining Syrian Jews to leave if they wished. After concluding that the Jews remaining wanted to stay and would not leave, Israeli authorities cleared the story for publication. In 1994, former Syrian Chief Rabbi Avraham Hamra immigrated to Israel from New York together with his mother, wife, and six children.
The Jews who stayed in the United States initially faced many difficulties. To save face, President Assad had demanded that the departures not be called emigration: that the United States officially admit them as tourists, and that Syrian Jews purchase round-trip tickets to the United States. As a result, the United States granted them political asylum and temporary non-immigrant visas, rather than admitting them as refugees with a view to full citizenship. Therefore, they were unable to obtain U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, and thus could not leave the country, work in their chosen professions, obtain licenses, or apply for public assistance. In 2000, a bill was proposed in Congress that granted them citizenship.
21st century.
Civil war.
With the start of the 21st century, there was only a small, largely elderly community left in Syria. Jews were still officially banned from politics and government employment and did not have military service obligations. Jews were also the only minority to have their religion mentioned on their passports and identification cards. Though they were occasionally subjected to violence by Palestinian protesters, the Syrian government took measures to protect them. There was a Jewish primary school for religious studies, and Hebrew was allowed to be taught in some schools. Every two or three months, a rabbi from Istanbul visited the community to oversee the preparation of kosher meat, which residents froze and used until his next visit.
The community gradually shrank. From 2000 to 2010, 41 Syrian Jews made aliyah to Israel. In 2005, the U.S. State Department estimated the Jewish population at 80 in its annual International Religious Freedom Report.In 2013, the BBC revealed that the largest Jewish cemetery in Syria in Damascus had been demolished in favor of an ISIS regional headquarters while desecrating the dignity of the dead.
As of December 2014, with the Syrian civil war underway, fewer than 50 Jews were thought to remain in Syria.
In October 2015, with the threat of ISIS nearby, nearly all of the remaining Jews in Aleppo were rescued in a covert operation and moved to Israel, where they were resettled in Ashkelon. In August 2019, BBC Arabic visited some of the last remaining Jews living in Damascus. In April 2020 there were only a handful of elderly Jews remaining in the country, all in Damascus. Estimates of their number varied. In 2022 and 2024, it was reported that only four Jews remained,including two elderly Jewish women in the town of Qamishli. Another report put the figure at 3 in 2024. Another report stated that there were 20-30 Jews still in Syria.
Transitional period.
On December 17, 2024, following the fall of the Assad regime and a transitional government taking power, the "Times of Israel" reported that Jewish relics from the Jobar Synagogue would be returned to Syria. A representative of the new transitional government met the head of the Jewish community, Bakhour Chamntoub, and stated that the Jews would be protected and Syrian Jews abroad would be allowed to return. It was also announced that a delegation of Syrian Jewish business leaders from abroad would visit the country in a tour led by Israeli-American philanthropist Mordechai Kahana, with the intention of restoring the Jobar Synagogue. At the time, it was reported that the Jewish community numbered 9 people in total. 
On January 12, 2025, it was announced that the Jewish community in Syria numbers 8 persons with the passing of Hadiya Shatakh age 92. On January 5, 2025, Syrian Jewish Chief Rabbi Binyamin Hamra, has written to the head of Syria's new government Ahmed al-Sharaa to congratulate him on his victory over the toppled regime of Bashar al-Assad, and stress the importance of preserving Syria's historic Jewish community. In a January 16, 2025 interview, Bishor Simantov, one of the last remaining Jews in Damascus, stated that he believes that conditions in Syria have improved since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. As of February 22, 2025 the total of living Jews in Syria numbered 7. On March 9, 2025, Syrian Jews from the US asked the White House to lift sanctions so they can rebuild Damascus. A 2024 study revealed that stolen Syrian Jewish assets valued at $200,167,458 in 1947 would equate to $10,692,545,656 in current dollars.

Place of interest.
Arikamedu Archaeological Excavation.
Arikamedu is an archaeological site located at a distance of 1 km from Ariyankuppam, where Mortimer Wheeler conducted his best-known excavation in the 1940s. According to Wheeler, Arikamedu was a Tamil fishing village which was formerly a major port dedicated to bead making and trading with Roman traders. It flourished for centuries until the Romans left. Various Roman artifacts, such as a large number of amphorae bearing the mark of Roman potter schools VIBII, CAMURI and ITTA, have been found at the site, supporting the view on an ancient trade between Rome and the ancient Tamil country. An Archaeological Museum is also present.
Veerampattinam Temple Car Festival.
Sengazhuneer Amman Temple () at Veerampattinam is the abode of Sakti and is the oldest temple in Ariyankuppam. It is located at a distance of 2.5 km from Ariyankuppam.

Etiolation

In botany, etiolation is a characteristic of flowering plants (angiosperms) grown in partial or complete absence of light. It is characterized by long, weak stems; smaller leaves due to longer internodes; and a pale yellow color (chlorosis). The development of seedlings in the dark ("") leads to etiolated seedlings.
Effects.
Etiolation increases the likelihood that a plant will reach a light source, often from under the soil, leaf litter, or shade from competing plants. The growing tips are strongly attracted to light and will elongate towards it. The pale color results from a lack of chlorophyll.
Some of the changes that occur include
De-etiolation is the transition of seedlings from below-ground growth to above-ground growth form.
Causes.
Etiolation is controlled by the plant hormones called auxins, which are produced by the growing tip to maintain apical dominance. Auxin diffuses, and is transported, downwards from the tip, with effects including suppressing growth of lateral buds. Auxins are active in light; when they are active they stimulate proton pumps in the cell wall which increases the acidity of the cell wall and activates expansin (an enzyme that breaks bonds in the cell wall structure) that weaken the cell wall and allow the cell to expand.
Chloroplasts that have not been exposed to light are called etioplasts (see also plastids).
De-etiolation.
De-etiolation is a series of physiological and biochemical changes a plant shoot undergoes when emerging from the ground or in response to light after a period of insufficient light exposure. This process is known informally as greening. These changes that are triggered in the plant's shoots or already formed leaves and stems occur in preparation for photosynthesis.
Some of the changes that occur include
This process is regulated by the exposure of various photoreceptor pigments to light. Phytochrome A and phytochrome B both respond to an increasing proportion of red light to far-red light which occurs when the shoot comes out into the open. Cryptochrome 1 responds to increasing amounts of blue light when the shoot reaches the surface.

Jalan Ampang

Jalan Ampang or Ampang Road (Selangor state route B31) is a major road in the Klang Valley region, Selangor and the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Built in the 1880s, it is one of the oldest roads in the Klang Valley. It is a main road to Ampang Jaya and is easily accessible from Jalan Tun Razak or Jalan Ulu Klang (now part of the Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2 Route 28) from the Hulu Kelang or Setapak direction. It is also accessible from Cheras through Jalan Shamelin, from Jalan Tun Razak through Jalan Kampung Pandan via Taman Cempaka, from Kampung Pandan through Jalan Kampung Pandan Dalam via Taman Nirwana, from the Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2 via Pandan Indah and Taman Kencana and from Hulu Langat town through the mountain pass. Wangsa Maju, Setapak, central Kuala Lumpur, Ampang Park and Salak South surround Ampang. Jalan Ampang became the backbone of the road system linking Ampang to Kuala Lumpur before being surpassed by the Ampang-Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway (AKLEH) in 2001.
History.
Kuala Lumpur was founded in 1857 at the confluence of the Sungei Lumpur (now Gombak River) and the Klang River, which now houses the Kuala Lumpur Jamek Mosque. In 1849, Raja Abdullah acquired large sum of money from Chee Yam Chuan and other merchants from Malacca to start operation of tin mines in Ampang, granted by Sultan Muhammad. This soon attracted other Chinese shopkeepers which led to turning the isolated jungle settlement into a small town, of which Ampang, one of the earliest areas in the Klang Valley, opened for tin mining.
Ampang Road, as it was called then, has existed since the 1880s. It is one of Kuala Lumpur's earliest roads, leading from the tin mining village of Ampang to the heart of the city along the Ampang River. The road was widened in 1888 by G. T. Tickell, the then chairman of the Kuala Lumpur Sanitary Board. In Kuala Lumpur, the street then led on to Ampang Street (now known as Leboh Ampang) to its Chinese shophouses and the Malay village of Kampung Rawa (today known as Kampung Baru).
The old Ampang Road also housed the Selangor Turf Club (present grounds of the Petronas Twin Towers) and the Griffin Inn (an old colonial bar and night-club). Adjoining and across from these properties, the houses and land were owned by Loke Chow Kit. The latter (owner of Chow Kit &amp; Co, a department store) had his country-residence at the corner of Ampang Road and Treacher Road. Other notables who lived on Ampang Road were the families of Choo Kia Peng and Chan Chin Mun and The Bok and The Khoo families.
Pekan Ampang.
Pekan Ampang, the historical town centre of Ampang Jaya, is situated approximately 3 km from Kampung Lembah Jaya small village. The architecture of the town shares similarities with most towns and cities elsewhere in Malaya during the British colonial period. Pekan Ampang is still administratively a separate town, falling under the Ampang Jaya Municipal Council, but it was often included as part of the metropolitan area of Kuala Lumpur.
Maintenance.
In Kuala Lumpur, the roads are maintained by Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur or Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL). In Selangor side, the roads are maintained by the Malaysian Public Works Department (JKR) and Majlis Perbandaran Ampang Jaya (MPAJ).
Course.
The road generally runs in an east–west direction, starting from the junction of Leboh Ampang and Jalan Gereja in the Masjid Jamek area. The road continues northeastward, passing Bukit Nanas on the north side of the hill and following the Klang River until Dang Wangi, where the river turns north. The road keeps running eastward past Wisma Denmark and the Petronas Twin Towers, past embassy row until it reaches the eastern KL suburb of Ampang.

County Route 511 (New Jersey)

County Route 511 (CR 511) is a county highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The highway extends from Columbia Avenue (CR 510) in Morris Township to the New York state line in West Milford where the road continues as New York State Route 210.
Route description.
CR 511 begins at an intersection with CR 510 in Morris Township, Morris County, heading northeast on four-lane undivided Whippany Road. The route passes business parks before running between business parks to the northwest and homes to the southeast. The road widens into a divided highway and comes to the CR 650 intersection, where it forms the border between Hanover Township to the northwest and Morris Township to the southeast as it interchanges with the Route 24 freeway. CR 511 turns east into residential neighborhoods as an undivided road, becoming a divided highway again briefly as it comes to the CR 623 junction. At this point, the route fully enters Hanover Township and heads northeast past more homes, alternating between a four-lane divided and undivided road. CR 511 splits from Whippany Road by turning northwest onto two-lane Parsippany Road, with CR 622 continuing northeast along Whippany Road. The road turns north and passes over the Whippany River and crosses the Morristown and Erie Railway's Whippany Line at-grade before intersecting CR 622 Alternate and coming to an interchange with Route 10. Past this interchange, the road runs through wooded neighborhoods before entering Parsippany-Troy Hills. At this point, CR 511 widens to four lanes and passes business parks, briefly widening into a divided highway. The route narrows into a two-lane undivided road as it interchanges with I-287 and passes through residential and commercial areas a short distance to the east of Lake Parsippany. CR 511 widens back to four lanes passes more business parks prior to coming to a bridge over I-80 and reaching an intersection with US 202 and CR 630, where CR 511 forms a concurrency with US 202.
The two routes continue north on Parsippany Boulevard, a two-lane road that comes to an intersection with US 46, where the road is briefly state maintained. Past US 46, the road continues north, intersecting ramps that provide access to and from southbound I-287. Here, the road becomes county maintained again. It passes by business parks and then wooded residential areas, closely paralleling I-287 again. At the intersection with Intervale Road, US 202 and CR 511 make a right turn, immediately interchanging with I-287, with access to the southbound direction and from the northbound direction. The routes follow Intervale Road briefly before making a left turn to resume onto Parsippany Boulevard. The road crosses over the Jersey City Reservoir, which supplies drinking water to Jersey City, and enters Boonton, where the road becomes Washington Street. This street carries the two routes through residential areas before coming to another interchange with I-287 that also features access to the southbound direction and access from the northbound direction. Past this interchange, US 202 splits from CR 511 by heading to the northeast on Myrtle Avenue.
Past US 202, CR 511 continues northwest on Main Street and passes over NJ Transit's Montclair-Boonton Line near the Boonton Station before passing through the commercial downtown of Boonton. CR 511 splits from Main Street by turning north onto Boonton Avenue, with CR 624 continuing along Main Street. The road continues past homes before crossing into Boonton Township, where the route turns north into wooded mountain areas with some homes. The route continues north into Montville and turns northeast into less developed mountains, running to the east of the Taylortown Reservoir as it crosses into Kinnelon. In Kinnelon, CR 511 heads near wooded areas of residences, turning east near Fayson Lakes before winding north. The road enters Butler and reaches a junction with Route 23 in commercial areas. From here, the route continues past homes and some businesses, reaching the commercial downtown of Butler. In this area, CR 511 splits into a one-way pair, with the northbound direction turning east on Carey Avenue, north on Roberts Street, and west on High Street, and the southbound direction remaining on Boonton Avenue. At the north end of the one-way pair, the route intersects CR 618. After crossing the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway's New Jersey Subdivision line, CR 511 turns east onto Main Street and passes more downtown businesses.
Upon crossing the Pequannock River, CR 511 enters Bloomingdale in Passaic County and immediately intersects CR 694, becoming the Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike. The route passes homes and businesses in the downtown of Bloomingdale before CR 511 turns north onto Union Avenue, with CR 694 continuing east on the Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike. The road continues north past residential areas, heading northeast into more wooded areas with some homes. The route runs to the north of a lake and crosses into Wanaque, heading east into commercial areas and reaching ramps to and from the southbound lanes of I-287 prior to a junction with the northern terminus of CR 511 Alternate. At this point, CR 511 turns north onto Ringwood Avenue and passes a mix of residences and businesses. Farther north, the road passes more development as it runs a short distance to the east of the Wanaque Reservoir. The route heads into more wooded areas of development as it forms the border between Ringwood to the east and Wanaque to the west before completely entering Ringwood. In Ringwood, CR 511 enters dense mountain forests and winds along the eastern shore of the Wanaque Reservoir as Greenwood Lake Turnpike, intersecting Skyline Drive (CR 692) and CR 697. After the intersection with the latter, the road turns northwest and crosses over a few branches of the Wanaque Reservoir. The route curves north away from the reservoir and passes a few businesses as it comes to a junction with CR 698. From here, CR 511 turns northwest into more mountainous areas and enters West Milford, crossing the Wanaque River near the northern end of the Wanaque Reservoir. The road winds west through more rural areas with occasional homes and businesses before reaching the CR 696 intersection. Here, CR 511 makes a turn north and enters more dense commercial development as it comes to the intersection with the northern terminus of CR 513. The route passes more businesses as it begins to run along the western shore of Greenwood Lake, curving northwest prior to turning northeast and running through wooded residential areas along the lake. CR 511 continues along the lakeshore to the New York border, where the road continues into that state as NY 210.
History.
The northernmost part of present-day CR 511 near the New York border was made as the Ringwood and Long Pond Turnpike, running from Ringwood to the New York state line. West of Greenwood Lake, the road is now known as the Warwick Turnpike.
North of Pompton Lakes, what is now CR 511 was legislated in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering to be the northernmost part of Route 3. In 1929, this segment of Route 3 was amended to be the northernmost part of Route S4B, a spur of Route 4. This part of road was never built as a state highway.
CR 511 Alternate.
County Route 511 Alternate (CR 511 Alt) is an alternate route of CR 511. The highway extends 9.77 miles (15.72 kilometers) from the Boonton Turnpike (US 202) in Wayne to Union Avenue (CR 511) in Wanaque. The southern of this highway from the intersection of US 202 and Route 23 in Wayne to the highway's split with US 202 in Lincoln Park are an example of a wrong-way concurrency, as northbound CR 511 ALT is concurrent with southbound US 202, and vice versa.
Despite its name, County Route 511 Alternate only intersects its "parent" at its northern terminus, while its southern terminus is quite far apart from its parent.

John Pickard (politician)

John Pickard (27 April 1824 – 17 December 1883) was a New Brunswick businessman and political figure. He represented York in the House of Commons of Canada as an Independent Liberal from 1868 to 1883.
He was born in Douglas, New Brunswick in 1824 and began work with his father there. He later established himself as a merchant in Fredericton and a lumber merchant in York County. In partnership with Thomas Temple, he owned and operated a sawmill at Fredericton. He helped found the People's Bank of New Brunswick in 1864 and a director of the New Brunswick Railway. In 1865, he ran against Charles Fisher in York as an opponent of Confederation and was defeated. He was elected to represent York in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in an 1867 by-election after Fisher ran for a seat in the House of Commons. When Fisher was appointed judge, Pickard was elected to the federal parliament in an 1868 by-election. He supported Alexander Mackenzie during Mackenzie's term as prime minister.
He died in Fredericton in 1883.

Caoineadh Airt Uí Laoghaire

Caoineadh Airt Uí Laoghaire or the "Lament for Arthur O' Leary" is an Irish keen composed in the main by Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill, a member of the Gaelic gentry in the 18th century, who was born in County Kerry and lived near Macroom, County Cork, after her marriage to Art. The caoineadh has been described as the greatest poem written in either Ireland or Britain during the eighteenth century.
Eibhlín composed it on the subject of the death of her husband Art on 4 May 1773. It concerns the murder at "Carraig an Ime", County Cork, of Art, at the hands of the Irish MP Abraham Morris, and the aftermath. It is one of the key texts in the corpus of Irish oral literature. The poem was composed extempore and follows the rhythmic and societal conventions associated with keening and the traditional Irish wake respectively. The "Caoineadh" is divided into five parts composed in the main over the dead body of her husband at the time of the wake and later when Art was re-interred in Kilcrea.
Parts of the "Caoineadh" take the form of a verbal duel between Eibhlín and Art's sister. The acrimonious dialogue between the two women shows the disharmony between their two prominent families.
Thomas Kinsella made an English verse translation which was published in a bilingual anthology, "An Duanaire - Poems of the Dispossessed: an anthology of Gaelic poems", edited by Seán Ó Tuama (Dolmen Press, Portlaoise 1981 ). Another verse translation was the work of Frank O'Connor and this was included in Brendan Kennelly's anthology "The Penguin Book of Irish Verse" (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1970; pp. 78–86). Doireann Ní Ghríofa published her own translation at the end of her work “A Ghost in the Throat” (Tramp Press, 2020).
The text.
Traditional laments were always composed and sung "extempore", sometimes by a relative, at other times by a skilled professional. They incorporated traditional themes: the deceased is praised, his exploits remembered, vengeance threatened on his enemies, and he himself called back to life. All these themes are to be found in the "Caoineadh".
The greater part of the "Caoineadh" was composed by Eibhlín Dubh, with contributions from Art's father and sister. It survived in the oral tradition in various versions, the two most complete being supplied by Nóra Ní Shíndile from Boolymore (An Bhuaile Mhór), near Millstreet (Sráid an Mhuilinn) in County Cork, who died in 1873 in extreme old age. Ní Shíndile was a professional keener or "bean caointe". The lament was transcribed by the scribe and poet Éamonn de Bhál. The musicologist Liam Ó Noraidh published two fragments of Caoineadh Airt Uí Laoghaire in 1965, including the music; the first fragment was collected from Máire Bhean Uí Chonaill in Baile Bhuirne (Ballyvourney), County Cork, in 1941, and the second from Labhras Ó Cadhlaigh, who learned it from his mother. These two fragments and traditional laments collected elsewhere in Ireland all use variants of the same melody.
Part of the text runs as follows:

Luigi Allemandi

Luigi Allemandi (; 8 November 1903 – 25 September 1978) was an Italian footballer who played as a defender, usually as a left back. He was a member of the Italy national team which won the 1934 World Cup.
Club career.
Born in San Damiano Macra, province of Cuneo, Allemandi debuted in 1921 with A.C. Legnano. Later, he played with Juventus FC, F.C. Internazionale Milano, A.S. Roma, S.S.C. Venezia and S.S. Lazio, and also had a successful international career with Italy. However, the part of his career that stands out is the corruption scandal in the Torino–Juventus derby in 1927 that resulted in Torino being stripped of their title.
According to the official account, a manager from Torino offered Allemandi 35 000 lira to throw the game, 25 000 immediately and the rest after the match. Torino won the match 2–1, but Allemandi was one of the best players in the field, and when he went to collect the rest of the money he was refused. A journalist found out about the match fixing and went public with the information. After a controversial trial, along with Torino's title revocation, Allemandi was banned for life even though he always self-proclaimed innocent. He was later pardoned by CONI in 1928 and could play for Ambrosiana-Inter.
International career.
After debuting for the Italy national team in 1925, Allemandi eventually won the left back position from Umberto Caligaris before their 1934 World Cup qualifying match against Greece. Manager Vittorio Pozzo started him in every match of the final tournament, helping the "Azzurri" win the title on home soil; he later served as Italy's captain between 1935 and 1936.
He is also one of 9 players being part of both the 1927–30 Central European International Cup, the 1931-32 Central European International Cup &amp; the 1933–35 Central European International Cup successful campaigns.

<doc id="6959376" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6959376" title="Calcium-activated potassium channel">
Calcium-activated potassium channel

Calcium-activated potassium channels are potassium channels gated by calcium, or that are structurally or phylogenetically related to calcium gated channels. They were first discovered in 1958 by Gardos who saw that calcium levels inside of a cell could affect the permeability of potassium through that cell membrane. Then in 1970, Meech was the first to observe that intracellular calcium could trigger potassium currents. In humans they are divided into three subtypes: large conductance or BK channels, which have very high conductance which range from 100 to 300 pS, intermediate conductance or IK channels, with intermediate conductance ranging from 25 to 100 pS, and small conductance or SK channels with small conductances from 2-25 pS.
This family of ion channels is, for the most part, activated by intracellular Ca2+ and contains 8 members in the human genome. However, some of these channels (the KCa4 and KCa5 channels) are responsive instead to other intracellular ligands, such as Na+, Cl−, and pH. Furthermore, multiple members of family are both ligand and voltage activated, further complicating the description of this family. The KCa channel α subunits have six or seven transmembrane segments, similar to the KV channels but occasionally with an additional N-terminal transmembrane helix. The α subunits make homo- and hetero-tetrameric complexes. The calcium binding domain may be contained in the α subunit sequence, as in KCa1, or may be through an additional calcium binding protein such as calmodulin.
Structure.
Knowing the structure of these channels can provide insight into their function and mechanism of gating. They are made up of two different subunits, alpha and beta. The alpha subunit is a tetramer which forms the pore, the voltage sensor, and the calcium sensing region. This subunit of the channel is made up of seven trans-membrane units, and a large intracellular region. The voltage sensor is made by the S4 transmembrane region, which has several Arginine residues which act to ‘sense’ the changes in charge and move in a very similar way to other voltage gated potassium channels. As they move in response to the voltage changes they open and close the gate. The linker between the S5 and S6 region serves to form the pore of the channel. Inside of the cell, the main portion to note is the calcium bowl. This bowl is thought to be the site of calcium binding.
The beta subunit of the channel is thought to be a regulatory subunit of the channel. There are four different kinds of the beta subunit, 1, 2, 3, and, 4. Beta 2 and 3 are inhibitory, while beta 1 and 4 are excitatory, or they cause the channel to be more open than not open. The excitatory beta subunits affect the alpha subunits in such a way that the channel seldom inactivates.
Homology Classification and Descriptions.
Human KCa Channels.
Below is a list of the 8 known human calcium-activated potassium channel grouped according to sequence homology of transmembrane hydrophobic cores:
BK channel.
Though not implied in the name, but implied by the structure these channels can also be activated by voltage. The different modes of activation in these channels are thought to be independent of one another. This feature of the channel allows them to participate in many different physiologic functions. The physiological effects of BK channels have been studied extensively using knockout mice. In doing so it was observed that there were changes in the blood vessels of the mice. The animals without the BK channels showed increased mean arterial pressure and vascular tone. These findings indicate that BK channels are involved in the relaxation of smooth muscle cells. In any muscle cell, increased intracellular calcium causes contraction. In smooth muscle cells the elevated levels of intracellular calcium cause the opening of BK channels which in turn allow potassium ions to flow out of the cell. This causes further hyperpolarization and closing of voltage gated calcium channels, relaxation can then occur. The knockout mice also experienced intention tremors, shorter stride length, and slower swim speed. All of these are symptoms of ataxia, indicating that BK channels are highly important in the cerebellum.
Subtypes of BK Channels
IK channel.
Intermediate conductance channels seem to be the least studied of all of the channels. Structurally they are thought to be very similar to BK channels with the main differences being conductance, and the methods of modulation. It is known that IK channels are modulated by calmodulin, whereas BK channels are not.
IK channels have shown a strong connection to calcification in vasculature, as inhibition of the channel causes a decrease in vascular calcification. Over-expression of these channels has quite a different effect on the body. Studies have shown that this treatment causes proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. This finding has sparked further exploration surrounding these channels and researchers have found that IK channels regulate the cell cycle in cancer cells, B and T lymphocytes, and stem cells. These discoveries show promise for future treatments surrounding IK Channels.
Subtypes of IK Channels
SK channel.
Small conductance calcium activate potassium channels are quite different from their relatives with larger conductance. The main and most intriguing difference in SK Channels is that they are voltage insensitive. These channels can only be opened by increased levels of intracellular calcium. This trait of SK channels suggests that they have a slightly different structure than the BK and IK channels.
Like other potassium channels they are involved in hyperpolarization of cells after an action potential. The calcium activated property of these channels allows them to participate in vaso-regulation, auditory tuning of hair cells, and also the circadian rhythm. Researchers were trying to figure out which channels were responsible for the re-polarization and after-hyperpolarization of action potentials. They did this by voltage clamping cells, treating them with different BK, and SK channel blockers and then stimulating the cell to create a current. The researchers found that the re-polarization of cells happens because of BK channels and that a part of the after-hyperpolarization occurs because of current through SK channels. They also found that with blocking SK channels, current during after-hyperpolarization still occurred. It was concluded that there was a different unknown type of potassium channel allowing these currents.
It is clear that SK channels are involved in AHP. It is not clear exactly how this happens. There are three different ideas on how this is done. 1) Simple diffusion of Calcium accounts for the slow kinetics of these currents, 2) The slow kinetics is due to other channels with slow activations, or 3) The Calcium simply activates a second messenger system to activate the SK channels. Simple diffusion has been shown to be an unlikely mechanism because the current is temperature sensitive, and a diffusive mechanism would not be temperature sensitive. This is also unlikely because only the amplitude of the current is changed with concentration of Calcium, not the kinetics of the channel activation.
Subtypes of SK Channels
Prokaryotic KCa Channels.
A number of prokaryotic KCa channels have been described, both structurally and functionally. All are either gated by calcium or other ligands and are homologous to the human KCa channels, in particular the KCa1.1 gating ring. These structures have served as templates for ligand gating.

Noel Cleal

Noel Harvey "Crusher" Cleal (born 16 October 1958) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer and coach. A destructive for the Manly Sea Eagles, he also represented New South Wales in the State of Origin Series and the Australian national rugby league team.
Background.
Noel Cleal was born in Warialda, New South Wales, Australia.
Club career.
Noel Cleal along with his brother Les came to Sydney first-grade rugby league having already established a name for himself in the country. He had captain-coached the Wondai side to a country premiership in Queensland and, with his brother Les, helped steer an undefeated Sawtell Panthers to a Clayton Cup and maiden premiership, then represented for New South Wales Northern Division against the touring Great Britain Lions in 1979.
"Crusher" began his Sydney career with Eastern Suburbs Roosters in 1980 where he played at . He had three seasons with the Roosters before following coach Bob Fulton to Manly in 1983. Following the move to Manly, Fulton switched Cleal to , a move which assisted Cleal's ascendancy to State and National representative honours.
Before the start of the 1987 NSWRL season, the Manly board had wanted coach Fulton to install Cleal as club captain replacing Paul Vautin. Fulton however had other ideas and Vautin retained the captaincy. After missing the first eight games of the season while recovering from a broken arm suffered against Hull F.C. on the 1986 Kangaroo tour, Cleal returned to the side from the bench in the Round 9 clash with Easts at Brookvale Oval (scoring the winning try from a Paul Vautin kick). From then on he played each game from the second row, helping the Sea Eagles to their 1987 Grand Final win over the Canberra Raiders in the last grand final played at the Sydney Cricket Ground (Cleal, who was one of the Sea Eagles better players on an unseasonably hot day, suffered a knock to the head during the game and finished the match on the bench). During that year the relationship between Vautin and Cleal was reported to be 'frosty' as a result of the captaincy saga, though both players dispute the claims.
During the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, Cleal captained what was a makeshift Manly side that was missing 6 regular first grade players to a famous 30–0 win over the Lions at Brookvale Oval. Manly had gone into the mid-week match missing captain Paul Vautin, centre Michael O'Connor, prop forward Phil Daley (all rested for the following weekends first Ashes series test against the Lions), as well as fullback Dale Shearer, winger David Ronson and hooker Mal Cochrane. Cleal had a point to prove in the game against the Lions after controversially being left out of Australia's squad for the Ashes series.
Following from a 1985–86 stint with English club Widnes, Cleal returned to English rugby league in 1989 for two seasons with Hull FC after injury had restricted him to only 4 games for Manly during the 1989 Winfield Cup season. Cleal retired from playing during the 1990–91 season, during which he had become coach of Hull following the departure of Brian Smith to St George. This included coaching Hull (from the sidelines) when they played the Bob Fulton coached Australians at The Boulevard during the 1990 Kangaroo Tour in which the Kangaroos defeated Hull 34–4. After the game Cleal told Channel 10 who were covering the tour that "I'm sitting on both sides of the fence here. It's good to see the Aussies play so well, especially with the third test coming up. But I thought that our guys were just outclassed, they were a far better side. And I suppose when you're hot, you're hot and the Aussies were hot tonight. That was the end of the story."
Despite the heavy defeat by the Kangaroos, Cleal coached Hull to go on to win the Premiership for the 1990–91 season, defeating the defending premiers Widnes 14–4 in the Premiership Trophy Final at Old Trafford, Manchester on Sunday 12 May 1991.
Representative career.
After having made his representative début in the centres for NSW in the second game of the 1981 Interstate series against Queensland at Sydney's Leichhardt Oval (the last game played under the old "State of Residence" rules), Cleal represented the NSW Blues in 12 State of Origin games between 1984 and 1988. Some of Cleal's best football was played at the State of Origin level, he was the NSW forward who troubled Queensland most at a time when the Blues were just beginning to match the passion of their interstate rivals. He is commonly known as the man who coined the inspirational phrase "Dare to Dream" which was an extract from the game and series winning pep talk given by him during half time of game 2 of the 1985 state of origin series.
Noel Cleal's most famous moment in Origin football was also an embarrassing one. During Game 2 of the 1984 series on a wet and very muddy Sydney Cricket Ground, Cleal attempted a goal-line drop out after the Blues had been caught in their own in-goal area. Unfortunately for Cleal and NSW, his attempted kick travelled less than a metre resulting in a Qld penalty from which Mal Meninga scored two vital points. Cleal's kick was made to look worse later in the game when Qld captain Wally Lewis kicked a 45-metre drop-out from the same spot. However, Lewis later admitted that he had used his teammates to distract referee Barry Gomersall enough so that he did not drop-kick the ball as required, but actually kicked it just before it hit the ground and got stuck in the mud as Cleal's kick had.
Despite being from the country, Cleal was chosen for City Firsts at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1984 at a time when the annual City vs Country game was played under residence rules. Cleal scored one of City's 7 tries as City continued their dominance with an easy 38–12 win. From 1985 Cleal would be selected for Country Firsts, playing for the team in 1985 and 1986. The annual clash was then played under Origin rules from 1987 with Cleal playing his only game for Country Origin that year, again scoring a try despite losing 30–22 at Parramatta Stadium.
Cleal played 10 Tests for Australia in 1985 and 1986. He made his test début in Game 1 of the 1985 Trans-Tasman Test series at Lang Park in Brisbane, scoring a try on début as Australia defeated New Zealand 26–20. The game was noted for the spiteful clash between rival props Greg Dowling (Australia) and Kevin Tamati (NZ). Both had been sent to the sin-bin by French referee Julien Rascagneres, but the fight started up again on the sidelines right in front of the Channel 9 television cameras. Cleal was moved to the bench (for the only time in his test career) for the second test at Carlaw Park in Auckland following the return of his club teammate Paul Vautin as Australia wrapped up the series with a 10–6 win thanks to a late John Ribot try and conversion which got them out of gaol after looking at an embarrassing 6–4 loss. Following mass changes to the team by coach Terry Fearnley, which included Cleal being dropped from the team, the Kiwis out classed the disjointed Australians with a resounding 18–0 win in the third test at Carlaw Park.
After NSW won the 1986 State of Origin series 3-0 (the first clean sweep in Origin history), Cleal then played in all 3 tests of the 1986 Trans-Tasman Test series against New Zealand (won 3-0 by the now Don Furner coached Aussies), before being selected for the 1986 Kangaroo Tour of Great Britain and France where he played 7 games (including one on the wing against Halifax at Thrum Hall) and scored 3 tries. Cleal played three more tests on the tour, including scoring two tries in Australia's 62–12 win in a pre-tour test against Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby, as well as the first two tests of The Ashes series against Great Britain, both easily won by the Kangaroos 38–16 at Old Trafford in Manchester and 34–4 at the Elland Road ground in Leeds. Cleal then suffered a broken arm in a minor tour game that ended his tour. The second test against Great Britain in Leeds where his strong running resulted in his 5th test try and being named as the official Man of the Match, would prove to be Noel Cleal's final test appearance for Australia.
Post playing.
In his first year as coach of Hull FC, Cleal took the club to Premiership victory during the 1990–91 season. Although still the assistant coach to Brian Smith at the time, Cleal's first time coaching Hull was when they lost 34–4 to Australia who were on the 1990 Kangaroo tour with Smith taking a backseat role as he was preparing to return to Sydney to coach St George.
On his return to Australia in 1992 he was appointed junior development and recruitment officer with the Parramatta Eels.
In 2004 Cleal returned to Manly in a similar role, but moved to the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in 2012 (along with Manly coach Des Hasler) following the Sea Eagles 2011 NRL Grand Final win over the New Zealand Warriors.
Accolades.
In 1984 he was the runner up in the Rothman's Medal and was named as the Dally M Second Rower of the year. He was runner up to Parramatta's Peter Wynn in the 1985 Dally M Second Rower of the year, but would win the award for a second time in 1986.
In 2000 Cleal was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his representative career for his country and state, and his supportive of Junior League at Local and regional level.
In 2005 he was named one of the 25 greatest ever players for NSW.
Playing Record.
His son Kane made his first grade début with Manly in 2004. Kane played professional rugby league for South Sydney Rabbitohs, Canterbury Bulldogs and Manly Sea Eagles.

Voltage-gated potassium channel

Voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs) are transmembrane channels specific for potassium and sensitive to voltage changes in the cell's membrane potential. During action potentials, they play a crucial role in returning the depolarized cell to a resting state.
Classification.
Alpha subunits.
Alpha subunits form the actual conductance pore. Based on sequence homology of the hydrophobic transmembrane cores, the alpha subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels are grouped into 12 classes. These are labeled Kvα1-12. The following is a list of the 40 known human voltage-gated potassium channel alpha subunits grouped first according to function and then subgrouped according to the Kv sequence homology classification scheme:
Delayed rectifier.
slowly inactivating or non-inactivating
A-type potassium channel.
rapidly inactivating
Inwardly-rectifying.
Passes current more easily in the inward direction (into the cell, from outside).
Modifier/silencer.
Unable to form functional channels as homotetramers but instead heterotetramerize with Kvα2 family members to form conductive channels.
Beta subunits.
Beta subunits are auxiliary proteins that associate with alpha subunits, sometimes in a α4β4 stoichiometry. These subunits do not conduct current on their own but rather modulate the activity of Kv channels.
Proteins minK and MiRP1 are putative hERG beta subunits.
Animal research.
The voltage-gated K+ channels that provide the outward currents of action potentials have similarities to bacterial K+ channels.
These channels have been studied by X-ray diffraction, allowing determination of structural features at atomic resolution.
The function of these channels is explored by electrophysiological studies.
Genetic approaches include screening for behavioral changes in animals with mutations in K+ channel genes. Such genetic methods allowed the genetic identification of the "Shaker" K+ channel gene in "Drosophila" before ion channel gene sequences were well known.
Study of the altered properties of voltage-gated K+ channel proteins produced by mutated genes has helped reveal the functional roles of K+ channel protein domains and even individual amino acids within their structures.
Structure.
Typically, vertebrate voltage-gated K+ channels are tetramers of four identical subunits arranged as a ring, each contributing to the wall of the trans-membrane K+ pore. Each subunit is composed of six membrane spanning hydrophobic α-helical sequences, as well as a voltage sensor in S4. The intracellular side of the membrane contains both amino and carboxy termini. The high resolution crystallographic structure of the rat Kvα1.2/β2 channel has recently been solved (Protein Databank Accession Number ), and then refined in a lipid membrane-like environment ().
Selectivity.
Voltage-gated K+ channels are selective for K+ over other cations such as Na+. There is a selectivity filter at the narrowest part of the transmembrane pore.
Channel mutation studies have revealed the parts of the subunits that are essential for ion selectivity. They include the amino acid sequence (Thr-Val-Gly-Tyr-Gly) or (Thr-Val-Gly-Phe-Gly) typical to the selectivity filter of voltage-gated K+ channels. As K+ passes through the pore, interactions between potassium ions and water molecules are prevented and the K+ interacts with specific atomic components of the Thr-Val-Gly-[YF]-Gly sequences from the four channel subunits .
It may seem counterintuitive that a channel should allow potassium ions but not the smaller sodium ions through. However in an aqueous environment, potassium and sodium cations are solvated by water molecules. When moving through the selectivity filter of the potassium channel, the water-K+ interactions are replaced by interactions between K+ and carbonyl groups of the channel protein. The diameter of the selectivity filter is ideal for the potassium cation, but too big for the smaller sodium cation. Hence the potassium cations are well "solvated" by the protein carbonyl groups, but these same carbonyl groups are too far apart to adequately solvate the sodium cation. Hence, the passage of potassium cations through this selectivity filter is strongly favored over sodium cations.
Open and closed conformations.
The structure of the mammalian voltage-gated K+ channel has been used to explain its ability to respond to the voltage across the membrane. Upon opening of the channel, conformational changes in the voltage-sensor domains (VSD) result in the transfer of 12-13 elementary charges across the membrane electric field. This charge transfer is measured as a transient capacitive current that precedes opening of the channel. Several charged residues of the VSD, in particular four arginine residues located regularly at every third position on the S4 segment, are known to move across the transmembrane field and contribute to the gating charge. The position of these arginines, known as gating arginines, are highly conserved in all voltage-gated potassium, sodium, or calcium channels. However, the extent of their movement and their displacement across the transmembrane potential has been subject to extensive debate. Specific domains of the channel subunits have been identified that are responsible for voltage-sensing and converting between the open and closed conformations of the channel. There are at least two closed conformations. In the first, the channel can open if the membrane potential becomes more positive. This type of gating is mediated by a voltage-sensing domain that consists of the S4 alpha helix that contains 6–7 positive charges. Changes in membrane potential cause this alpha helix to move in the lipid bilayer. This movement in turn results in a conformational change in the adjacent S5–S6 helices that form the channel pore and cause this pore to open or close. In the second, "N-type" inactivation, voltage-gated K+ channels inactivate after opening, entering a distinctive, closed conformation. In this inactivated conformation, the channel cannot open, even if the transmembrane voltage is favorable. The amino terminal domain of the K+ channel or an auxiliary protein can mediate "N-type" inactivation. The mechanism of this type of inactivation has been described as a "ball and chain" model, where the N-terminus of the protein forms a ball that is tethered to the rest of the protein through a loop (the chain). The tethered ball blocks the inner porehole, preventing ion movement through the channel.

Urszula Radwańska

Urszula Radwańska (; born 7 December 1990) is a Polish professional tennis player.
Radwańska has won one doubles title on the WTA Tour, as well as seven singles and eleven doubles titles on the ITF Women's Circuit. On 8 October 2012, she reached her career-high singles ranking of world No. 29. On 21 September 2009, she peaked at No. 74 in the doubles rankings. As a junior player, Radwańska won the 2007 Wimbledon girls' singles title, culminating in the junior year-ending world No. 1 ranking.
Nicknamed Ula, she is the younger sister of Agnieszka Radwańska.
Tennis career.
As a junior player, Radwańska won Grand Slam titles, including the 2007 Wimbledon girls' singles, culminating in the junior year-ending world No. 1 ranking. This was the launching pad into her professional career, where she has been getting into WTA main draws via qualifying and wildcards.
In 2007, Radwańska played in the main draw of three WTA Tour tournaments. She lost in the first round of the Tier II Warsaw Open in Warsaw, the second round of the Tier III Japan Open in Tokyo, and the quarterfinals of the Tier III Bangkok Open after defeating fourth-seeded Virginie Razzano in the third round. Urszula and Agnieszka Radwańska won a doubles title together at the İstanbul Cup.
At the 2008 Wimbledon Championships, Radwańska made her Grand Slam singles debut, losing in the second round to two-time champion Serena Williams 4–6, 4–6. Having seen the fight she put up in this match, the commentator Andrew Castle observed: "She is sound in just about all areas, and she knows what to do with the ball, she seems to have an understanding, a little like Martina Hingis."
2009: Breaking into the top 100.
On 16 February 2009, the Radwańska sisters played their first official tour match against each other in the first round of the Dubai Tennis Championships. Urszula won the match in straight sets 6–4, 6–3 hitting six aces and 25 winners.
At the Indian Wells Open, she defeated sixth-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova in three sets, the highest ranked player she had ever defeated. She then lost to ninth-seeded Caroline Wozniacki in her first ever WTA fourth-round match. Her results at this tournament caused her singles ranking to break into the top 100 for the first time.
In the second Grand Slam tournament of the year, the French Open, Radwańska lost in the first round to Yanina Wickmayer. She advanced to the second round of the Wimbledon Championships, falling to No. 14, Dominika Cibulková. She then competed in the US Open, losing to Kristina Barrois in the opening round.

She reached the second round of the French Open, losing to fourth seed Petra Kvitová. Radwańska started the grass-court season playing the $75k tournament in Nottingham. She saved three match points in her opening round against Misaki Doi and went on to win the title. Weather forced the semifinals and final to be played on the same day. Radwańska won both matches in three sets, defeating Irina Falconi in and CoCo Vandeweghe. This result granted her qualification into the main draw for the London Olympics. She reached her first career final at the Rosmalen Open where she lost to Nadia Petrova.
At Wimbledon, Radwańska lost her first round to Marina Erakovic. She teamed up with her sister in doubles; they advanced to the third round before withdrawing due to Agnieszka's illness.
She started out the summer hardcourt season at the Silicon Valley Classic and Southern California Open where she reached the quarterfinals of both events.
In London Olympics, she lost to eventual champion Serena Williams (2–6, 3–6). Partnering with her sister in doubles, she lost in the second round to the top seeded team Liezel Huber/Lisa Raymond.
Returning to hardcourts, she qualified for the main draw at Rogers Cup and Western &amp; Southern Open where she lost to Ekaterina Makarova and Serena Williams respectively. At the US Open she lost in the first round to 20th seed Roberta Vinci, who subsequently eliminated her older sister in the fourth round.
She reached back-to-back semifinal at the Tashkent Open and Guangzhou International Open but fell to Irina-Camelia Begu and Hsieh Su-wei, respectively. Both went on to win the title. At the Pan Pacific Open, she defeated Ana Ivanovic in the second round but lost to Angelique Kerber in the third. She lost in the first round of the China Open to Romina Oprandi, and defeated Francesca Schiavone at the first round of the Kremlin Cup.

Prothrombin complex concentrate

Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), also known as factor IX complex, sold under the brand name Kcentra among others, is a combination medication made up of blood clotting factors II, IX, and X(3-factor PCC) or, when also containing factor VII as does Kcentra, 4-factor PCC. It is used to treat and prevent bleeding in hemophilia B if pure factor IX is not available. It may also be used for reversal of warfarin therapy. It is given by slow injection into a vein. Another product, activated prothrombin complex concentrate or FEIBA (Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Agent), may be used for acquired hemophilia.
Common side effects include allergic reactions, headache, vomiting, and sleepiness. Other serious side effects include blood clots which may result in a heart attack, stroke, pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis. Antibodies may form after long term use such that future doses are less effective.
Prothrombin complex concentrate came into medical use in the 1960s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is made from human plasma. Recombinant factor IX is also available in a stand-alone preparation.
Medical uses.
Prothrombin complex concentrate reverses the effects of warfarin and other vitamin K antagonist anti-coagulants and is used in cases of significant bleeding in people with a coagulopathy. It is also used when such a person must undergo an emergency operation. Other uses include a deficiency of one of the included clotting factors, either congenital or due to liver disease, and hemophilia. Several guidelines, including those from the American College of Chest Physicians, recommend prothrombin complex concentrate for warfarin reversal in people with serious bleeding.
For rapid anticoagulation reversal for surgery, four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate reduces international normalized ratio (INR) and decreases bleeding during surgery when compared with administration of fresh frozen plasma. No differences in thromboembolic event was found.
Contraindications.
The package insert states that prothrombin complex concentrate is contraindicated in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation, a pathological activation of coagulation, because giving clotting factors would only further fuel this process. However, if the PCC is given because factor levels are low, it can restore normal coagulation. As PCC products contain heparin, they are contraindicated in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Chemistry.
Prothrombin complex concentrate contains a number of blood clotting factors. Typically this includes factor II, IX, and X. Some versions also contain factor VII, protein C, and protein S. Heparin may be added to stop early activation of the factors.
History.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced its approval in 2013. The FDA approved Kcentra's orphan drug status in December 2012.
Society and culture.
Economics.
In the United States a dose of prothrombin complex concentrate costs about US $3200 though one study described the cost as $11 650. The Australian National Blood Authority sets Prothrombinex (500 IU) at around AUD$327. 
Brand names.
A number of different formulations are available globally.

Two-pore-domain potassium channel

The two-pore-domain or tandem pore domain potassium channels are a family of 15 members that form what is known as leak channels which possess Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (open) rectification. These channels are regulated by several mechanisms including signaling lipids, oxygen tension, pH, mechanical stretch, and G-proteins. Two-pore-domain potassium channels correspond structurally to a inward-rectifier potassium channel α-subunits. Each inward-rectifier potassium channel α-subunit is composed of two transmembrane α-helices, a pore helix and a potassium ion selectivity filter sequence and assembles into a tetramer forming the complete channel. The two-pore domain potassium channels instead are dimers where each subunit is essentially two α-subunits joined together.
Each single channel does "not" have two pores; the name of the channel comes from the fact that "each subunit" has two P (pore) domains in its primary sequence. To quote Rang and Dale (2015), "The nomenclature is misleading, especially when they are incorrectly referred to as two-pore channels".
A decrease in these leak channels activity is known as 'channel arrest', which reduces oxygen consumption and allows animals to survive anoxia.
Below is a list of the 15 known two-pore-domain human potassium channels:

County Route 510 (New Jersey)

County Route 510 (CR 510) is a county highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The highway extends from North Road (CR 513) in Chester to McCarter Highway (Route 21) in Newark.
A separate, westbound portion of CR 510 stretches through Morristown.
Route description.
Morris County.
CR 510 begins at an intersection with CR 513 in Chester Borough, Morris County, heading southeast on two-lane undivided Main Street. From the western terminus, CR 510 is signed as part of the former Route 24, which continues west along CR 513. The road passes through residential areas as it crosses into Chester Township and becomes Mendham Road, continuing southeast through more wooded areas of homes along with a few fields. The route curves east and continues into Mendham Township. Farther east, CR 510 continues into Mendham Borough and becomes Main Street, running through residential neighborhoods. In the commercial center of town, the route intersects CR 525 and CR 614. From this point, the road turns northeast and passes more homes as well as a few businesses, intersecting CR 646 before crossing back into Mendham Township. CR 510 runs east again near more residences before entering Morris Township and becomes Mendham Road again. Here, the road runs through forested areas near Lewis Morris Park before running through more woodland with a few homes. The route begins to turn more to the northeast as it enters more residential surroundings before crossing into Morristown. At this point, CR 510 heads east on Washington Street and passes homes and businesses. The road reaches the commercial downtown and intersects CR 648 before meeting US 202 and the western terminus of Route 124 at the Park Place square.
After running through the square, CR 510 leaves the former alignment of Route 24 and continues east onto Morris Street, passing more downtown businesses. Along this stretch, CR 510 splits into a one-way pair, with the eastbound direction continuing east on Morris Street, which is a two-way road, and the westbound direction following Lafayette Street, which is one-way westbound carrying three lanes. Both directions cross under New Jersey Transit's Morristown Line near the Morristown Station. The eastbound alignment of the route becomes three lanes with two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane after the railroad bridge, passing through commercial areas before running near a few homes, while the westbound direction passes businesses. Both directions of the route come to an interchange with I-287. From this interchange, eastbound CR 510 runs through residential areas as a one-way road with three lanes while westbound CR 510 passes through woodland. The two directions of CR 510 join again at an intersection with CR 511 on the border of Morristown and Morris Township. westbound CR 510 runs northeast along two-way, four-lane divided Whippany Road and southeast and intersects CR 511 as it turns southeast onto Columbia Turnpike. After the one-way pair, CR 510 heads east on four-lane undivided Columbia Turnpike past business parks and residential neighborhoods in Morris Township, eventually gaining a third eastbound lane. The route becomes a four-lane divided highway as it crosses CR 623 and enters Hanover Township as it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with the Route 24 freeway. Following this, the road continues into Florham Park as a four-lane undivided road as it passes to the south of Morristown Municipal Airport and runs through woods and meadows. The road passes homes before intersecting CR 608/CR 632 and CR 609 in a commercial area, at which point CR 510 is briefly a divided highway. The route curves southeast and passes near more residential neighborhoods prior to widening back into a divided highway and passing to the south of business parks.
Essex County.
Upon crossing the Passaic River, CR 510 enters Livingston in Essex County and becomes four-lane undivided South Orange Avenue as it runs through wooded areas with some business parks. After an intersection with the southern terminus of the Eisenhower Parkway (CR 609), the route becomes a divided highway again and passes between the Livingston Mall to the north and a branch of Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center to the south. After crossing CR 607, the road becomes undivided again and passes to the south of residential neighborhoods before running through dense forests. In this area, CR 510 crosses CR 649, where it is briefly a grade-separated divided highway, before becoming undivided and crossing CR 608. From here, the route enters residential areas and crosses into Millburn, coming to the junction with CR 527. A short distance past CR 527, the road heads east into the forested South Mountain Reservation, a part of the Watchung Mountains. In this area, the road becomes a divided highway again and crosses the West Branch of the Rahway River into Maplewood. The route passes under a bridal path and winds southeast through the reservation (known locally as the "S Curves"), becoming the border between South Orange to the north and Maplewood to the south as it leaves the South Mountain Reservation and enters residential areas. A $30 million project to rework the "S curves" for safety and drainage is in progress.
CR 510 becomes undivided again as it fully enters South Orange and continues east through wooded areas of homes, forming a brief concurrency with CR 577. The road heads into the commercial downtown of South Orange as it passes over the East Branch of the Rahway River and under New Jersey Transit's Morris &amp; Essex Lines near the South Orange Station. The route intersects CR 638 Spur, CR 638, and CR 665 before passing near more homes and running to the north of Seton Hall University. CR 510 enters Newark at the Longfellow Avenue/Dover Street intersection and continues east into more commercial areas. The road crosses CR 605 and becomes the border between East Orange to the north and Newark to the south as it comes to the CR 619 junction. CR 510 fully enters Newark again as it comes to an interchange with the Garden State Parkway before passing to the south of Holy Sepulchre Cemetery and forming a brief concurrency with CR 509 a short distance later. The road passes south of Fairmount Cemetery and passes several urban homes and businesses, narrowing to two lanes before passing the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, where the route is five lanes wide with two eastbound lanes and three westbound lanes. CR 510 narrows to two lanes again as it intersects CR 603, where the route turns northeast onto Springfield Avenue. At this point, the route enters Downtown Newark and turns east onto four-lane Market Street near the Essex County Veterans Courthouse. At the Broad Street intersection, the road passes through Four Corners, which serves as the center of Newark. CR 510 comes to its eastern terminus at an intersection with Route 21 near Newark Penn Station, with Market Street continuing east under Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to provide access to Raymond Boulevard.
History.
The section running from Chester to Morristown was originally created as part of the Washington Turnpike, which stretched from Morristown to Philipsburg. This road was later incorporated into the William Penn Highway, which ran from New York to Pittsburgh. This was incorporated into Route 24 in 1927, before being removed by 1992. The section running from Morristown to Newark was created as the Columbia Turnpike. County Route 513 was established largely along its present-day alignment in 1952, along with the other 500-series county highways. The original eastern terminus was likely at Springfield Avenue in Newark, which was at the time Route 24. When that highway was truncated to the Maplewood/Irvington line, the segment of Route 24 east of South Orange Avenue was made part of CR 510; the route extended east of Route 21 along Market Street and Raymond Boulevard to an eastern terminus at the intersection of U.S. Route 1/9 and U.S. Route 1/9 Truck on the very eastern edge of Newark. This routing definitely existed in 1973, though the exact start and end dates are uncertain.

List of roads in Kuala Lumpur

Like all other historical urban centres, the capital city of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, contains a number of current and old roads and streets across the city.
This article contains an alphabetical list of notable roads within Kuala Lumpur.
Overview.
The majority of older roads in and around Kuala Lumpur were originally named during British rule in Selangor, and as such, were in English and named after British figures, a handful of local dignitaries or royalties, districts, local populations, landmarks or geographical features. Other surrounding locales, such as Kampung Baru, Pudu, Imbi and Sentul have had roads known primarily in Malay since colonial rule.
Following Malaya's independence in 1957 and the formation of Malaysia in 1963, street names in Kuala Lumpur were translated into the Malay language, some of which were given more simplified descriptions (i.e. "Old Market Square" as "Medan Pasar Besar" and "Foch Avenue" as "Jalan Foch"), as Malay was officially adopted as the official language of Malaysia in 1967.
The vast majority of the street names was further renamed "en masse" in 1981, as part of post-independence decolonisation pushed by the then newly elected Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad. Street names which previously featured semblances of English origins were replaced by those commemorating local Malay figures, Malay culture and key politicians in Malaya/Malaysia. The renaming included roads in the core of old Kuala Lumpur, as well as major thoroughfares in the city. Further renaming of old street names persists to date, with the rounds of revision conducted by the Kuala Lumpur City Hall as late as 2007 on streets in Pudu and in the fringe towns of Sungai Besi and Jinjang, where English and British-named street names were still in use. Minor roads, however, are typically spared from this form of renaming.
The accelerated development of the city after the country's independence also contributed to the widening of existing artery routes, creation of highways and new roadways, and extensive grade separation of roadways. This resulted in significant alterations of roadways in the city, with several roads merged, split, or modified, forming new roads or retiring old ones.
Criticism.
While earlier street name changes post-independence have been generally accepted, the persistent renaming campaign of existing roads and growing public awareness of the history of Kuala Lumpur's streets has increasingly drawn ire from local communities, particularly road users, postal users, and historians, due to inconvenience borne from memorising longer, more convoluted names of roads which were formerly shorter and easier to memorise, the increased cost of replacing and maintaining documents and signages, and the revisionist undertones of the renaming policy. One renaming campaign of eight major roads in honour of former "Yang di-Pertuan Agongs" on 2 November 2014 had notably drawn backlash from the public as well as Member of Parliament Lim Lip Eng, leading to a rebuttal by UMNO Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin; the name change proceeded in spite of the controversy.
Standard translations.
A guideline was formulated for the translation of English signage on roads. The Kuala Lumpur City Hall is pursuing a process of standardisation for road signage. (e.g. Tengkat "Tong Shin" has been renamed as "Jalan Tong Shin")

Malta national cricket team

The Malta national cricket team is the team that represents the Republic of Malta in international cricket. The team is organised by the Malta Cricket Association, which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1998. and an associate member in 2017. A Maltese national team first played as early as 1891, when an XVIII of Malta played an English team on its way to a tour of Australia. The team was not revived until 1990, when it participated in the European Cricketer Cup in Guernsey. Since then, Malta has appeared regularly in European Cricket Council tournaments, generally in the lower divisions.
History.
2018-Present.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Malta and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.
Malta played its first official T20I against, Spain, on 29 March 2019 during the 2019 Spain Triangular T20I Series. The match was played at La Manga Club, Murcia, Spain.
International competition.
Malta competed in every edition of the European Affiliates Championship from 1999 to 2005, their best result coming in 2001 when they reached the semi-finals. They competed in the tournament predecessor, the European Nations Cup in 1997, and competed in its successor, Division Three of the European Championship in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2012.
In October 2013, Malta hosted an International Tournament, inviting the International Cricket Associations of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Russia. Malta played their games from 4 to 6 October. Khosla captained the side to 3 wins out of 3, culminating in a final day victory over Hungary where the latter could've also won the tournament with a victory. The winning runs were scored on a wide delivery with Haroon Majeed facing the ball.
Malta followed up their success with a second successive International Tournament victory in Budapest, Hungary. Malta defeated the UAE in the final in a tournament compromising of Hungary, Poland, Austria, Czech Republic, UAE and Malta. Bikram Arora hit the winning runs with a drive to the leg-side which made it to the boundary. Malta's Christopher Chellew won the Player of the Tournament and also scored the most runs in tournament.
Malta competed in a third International Tournament along with Sweden, Poland and Czech Republic, hosted by the latter in Prague. Malta had their 7 match unbeaten run ended by Sweden, when Malta fell 5 runs short of the Swedes' first innings target of 198 runs. Heavy rain and poor weather conditions all round caused Malta's game with Czech Republic to first be suspended and then abandoned in the 2nd innings after Malta were bowled out for 122. Malta got their first and only win of the tournament by successfully chasing 140 runs against Poland, who had already wrapped up the Tournament for themselves the previous day. This left Malta third in the table, level on points on Sweden but behind them on net run rate.
In September of the same year, Malta hosted Hungary in a 3-match series. The first two games were T20s with the first game being a decisive Malta victory while the second saw Hungary become the first National Cricket Team to win in Malta. The final game was a 50-Over Match. Hungary batted first and were bowled out for 121 runs. Chellew scored a half-century to inspire Malta to victory and a series win.
Domestic cricket.
Malta boasts a climate that enables cricket to be played all year round and encourages visiting teams to come and play on the island. There are two grounds: Marsa Cricket Ground, in existence for over a century and Hal Safi Cricket Ground, which is rarely used. Twelve clubs contested the T20 2020 Summer League: Knight Kings, Super Kings, Southern Crusaders, Power Hitters, Swieqi United, Bugibba Blasters, Marsa, Msida Warriors, Overseas, American University of Malta, Paola Boys and Mater Dei. The 2019–20 Winter League took the form of a 50-overs Marsa Federations Cup, featuring five regional teams: Birkirkara Blues, Mellieha Stars, Rabat Titans, Sliema Riders and Valletta Vikings.
Current squad.
This lists all the players who have played for Malta in the past 12 months or has been part of the latest T20I squad. Uncapped players are listed in "italics".

Satish Gujral

Satish Gujral (25 December 1925 – 26 March 2020) was an Indian painter, sculptor, muralist and writer of the post-independent era. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian award of the Republic of India, in 1999. His elder brother, Inder Kumar Gujral, was the Prime Minister of India between 1997 and 1998.
Early life.
Gujral was born in Jhelum in the Punjab Province of British India (now in Punjab, Pakistan) into a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family. He was the son of Indian politician Avtar Narain Gujral and the brother of I. K. Gujral, the 12th Prime Minister of India; his sister in law, Sheila Gujral, was a noted Hindi poet. His nephew Naresh Gujral is also a politician.
Education.
Because of his hearing problem, many schools refused admission to Gujral. One day he saw a bird sitting on a tree branch and drew a picture of it. It was an early indication of his interest in painting and later in 1939, he joined the Mayo School of Arts in Lahore, to study applied arts. He moved to Bombay in 1944 and enrolled in the Sir JJ School of Art. In 1947, due to a recurring sickness, he was forced to drop out of school and leave Bombay.
In 1952, Gujral received a scholarship to study at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, where he was apprenticed to the renowned artists Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros.
Works.
The Partition of India and the associated agony of the immigrants impacted a young Satish and manifested itself in the artworks he created. From 1952 to 1974, Gujral organised shows of his sculptures, paintings and graphics in many cities across the world such as New York City, New Delhi, Montreal, Berlin and Tokyo, among others.
Gujral was also an architect and his design of the Belgium Embassy in New Delhi was selected by the international forum of architects as one of the finest buildings built in the 20th century.
Personal life.
Gujral lived with his wife Kiran (1937-2024) in New Delhi. Their son Mohit Gujral, who is an architect, is married to former model, Feroze Gujral. They also have 2 daughters, Alpana, a jewellery designer, and Raseel Gujral Ansal, an interior designer and owner of Casa Paradox &amp; Casa Pop and is married to Navin Ansal.
In popular culture.
Dozens of documentaries have been made recording Gujral's work. The Films Division of India produced a short documentary film on his life, titled "Satish Gujral", directed by Balwant Gargi it provides an overview of his life and works.
He was also part of the 2007 BBC television film, "Partition: The Day India Burned". A 24-minute documentary called "A Brush with Life" was released on 15 February 2012 which was based on his own book with the same name. Four books of his work have been published, including an autobiography.
Global policy.
Along with his brother Inder Kumar Gujral, he was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.
Awards.
Gujral was awarded India's second-highest civilian honour Padma Vibhushan in 1999. In April 2014, he was honoured with NDTV Indian of the Year Award.

Jervois-Scratchley reports

The Jervois-Scratchley reports of 1877 concerned the defences of the Australian colonies, and influenced defence policy into the twentieth century.
Background.
From the time of the first settlement in Australia, the Royal Marines, the New South Wales Corps and a succession of regiments of the British Army had been responsible for defending the Australian colonies. With the withdrawal of British garrison troops in 1870 the various colonies moved to establish more significant defences of their own.
To provide guidance, Major General Sir William Jervois and Lieutenant Colonel Peter Scratchley were commissioned by a group of colonies to advise on defence matters. The two Royal Engineers inspected each colony's defences, leading to the Jervois-Scratchley reports of 1877. These were to form the basis of defence planning in Australia and New Zealand for the next 30 years.
Impact.
A consequence of their reports was that colonial defences were reorganised on one model with slight variations for each colony. Wealthier colonies tended to have a higher proportion of paid permanent soldiers and militia whilst the smaller colonies opted for more volunteers. Given that a large portion of their reports concentrated on sea ports the most visible signs of their influence are the many fortifications from the 1880s and later that may be found at the entrance to the larger ports of Australia and New Zealand. These include:

Nominal level

Nominal level is the operating level at which an electronic signal processing device is designed to operate. The electronic circuits that make up such equipment are limited in the maximum signal they can handle and the low-level internally generated electronic noise they add to the signal. The difference between the internal noise and the maximum level is the device's dynamic range. The nominal level is the level that these devices were designed to operate at, for best dynamic range and adequate headroom. When a signal is chained with improper gain staging through many devices, clipping may occur or the system may operate with reduced dynamic range. 
In audio, a related measurement, signal-to-noise ratio, is usually defined as the difference between the nominal level and the noise floor, leaving the headroom as the difference between nominal and maximum output. The measured level is a time average, meaning that the peaks of audio signals regularly exceed the measured average level. The headroom measurement defines how far the peak levels can stray from the nominal measured level before clipping. The difference between the peaks and the average for a given signal is the crest factor.
Standards.
VU meters are designed to represent the perceived loudness of a passage of music, or other audio content, measuring in volume units. Devices are designed so that the best signal quality is obtained when the meter rarely goes above nominal. The markings are often in dB instead of "VU", and the reference level should be defined in the device's manual. In most professional recording and sound reinforcement equipment, the nominal level is . In semi-professional and domestic equipment, the nominal level is usually −10 dBV. This difference is due to the cost required to create larger power supplies and output higher levels.
In broadcasting equipment, this is termed the Maximum Permitted Level, which is defined by European Broadcasting Union standards. These devices use peak programme meters instead of VU meters, which gives the reading a different meaning.
"Mic level" is sometimes defined as −60 dBV, though levels from microphones vary widely.
In video systems, nominal levels are 1 VP-P for synched systems, such as baseband composite video, and 0.7 VP-P for systems without sync. Note that these levels are measured peak-to-peak, while audio levels are time averages.

British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly

The British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly (BIPA, ) is a deliberative body consisting of members elected to those national legislative bodies found within Ireland and the United Kingdom, namely the parliaments of the United Kingdom, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the British crown dependencies. Its purpose is to foster common understanding between elected representatives from these jurisdictions.
The assembly consists of 25 members each from the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament) as well as five representatives each from the Scottish Parliament, the Senedd (Welsh Parliament), and the Northern Ireland Assembly, and one each from the States of Jersey, the States of Guernsey and the Tynwald of the Isle of Man.
History.
The assembly was established in 1990 as the British–Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body (BIIPB). It initially consisted of 25 members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and 25 members of the Oireachtas, the Irish parliament.
In 1998, the British–Irish Council was established under Strand 3 of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. The Council brings together ministers from the British and Irish governments, from the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and from the crown dependencies. However Strand 3 stated that, as well as inter-governmental links, "the elected institutions of the members will be encouraged to develop inter-parliamentary links, perhaps building on the British–Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body". In 2001, the assembly was enlarged to include representatives of legislative bodies in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey.
The fortieth plenary conference of the British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly met in Cavan, Ireland on 22–23 February 2010. On 22 November 2010, the assembly concluded its 41st plenary in Douglas, on the Isle of Man. This was the first plenary of the Assembly to be held in a crown dependency.
Irish parliamentarian Frank Feighan has chaired the assembly.
In October 2018, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley spoke to the assembly.
In October 2019, the British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Christopher Pincher spoke to the assembly about the importance of UK-Ireland co-operation after Brexit.
The 62nd meeting in October 2022 brought Lawmakers from Ireland, the British legislatures, the Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories to discuss matters of mutual interest, debate trade and publish reports on a range of issues including post Brexit trade and vaccine rollout.
The 64th meeting in May 2023 was the first hosted by a Crown Dependency, with delegates travelling to Jersey.
Functions.
The British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly holds two plenary sessions a year. Its four committees (dealing with sovereign matters between the Irish and Westminster parliaments, European affairs, economic matters, the environment and social matters) meet several times a year. They produce reports which are submitted for comment to governments, and which are discussed in plenary. A steering committee organises the work of the plenary and deals with the assembly's institutional matters.

Blueprint (magazine)

Blueprint was an architecture and design magazine that has been published in the UK between 1983 and 2020.
It offered a mix of criticism, news and feature writing on design and architecture, directed at professionals and non-professionals alike.
Blueprint takes architecture and design as its starting point and brings these thing into sharp focus via context, comment and analysis. Architecture and design do not exist in a vacuum.
- Johnny Tucker, former "Blueprint" editor
The magazine took a parallel approach to the different design disciplines, reflecting a belief that fashion, product, furniture and architectural design can share ideas.
History.
"Blueprint" was first published in October 1983 by Peter Murray and Deyan Sudjic. It was launched and funded by UK design figures including Terence Conran, Marcello Minale and Richard Rogers.
In 1983, Murray noticed a gap in the market for a magazine that presented lavish images and a critical analysis of the industry. He enlisted "Sunday Times" architecture critic Deyan Sudjic as editor, who in turn recruited a team of writers including Jonathan Glancey, Rowan Moore and Rick Poynor. Sudjic continued to edit "Blueprint" until 1994.
"Blueprint"'s subsequent contributors included novelist JG Ballard, cultural critic James Heartfield and art critic Matthew Collings. It has been edited by Sudjic, (who, since 2006, was director of the London Design Museum), architect and critic Rowan Moore. Vicky Richardson edited the magazine from 2004 until 2010. The last editor was Johnny Tucker.
"Blueprint" was published on a monthly basis until 2013 when the frequency was switched to bimonthly. The 369th issue of "Blueprint" was the last edition published in June 2020.

<doc id="6959639" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6959639" title="Purpura fulminans">
Purpura fulminans

Purpura fulminans is an acute, often fatal, thrombotic disorder which manifests as blood spots, bruising and discolouration of the skin resulting from coagulation in small blood vessels within the skin and rapidly leads to skin necrosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Causes.
Purpura fulminans is caused by defects in the protein C anticoagulant pathway. Identification of the cause of purpura fulminans often depends on the patient's age and circumstances of presentation.
Congenital protein C deficiency.
Congenital (inherited) defects in protein C activity are autosomal dominant and may be partial or severe loss of function. Hundreds of natural mutations of the protein C gene (PROC) have been identified.
Acquired protein C deficiency.
Acquired protein C deficiency is caused by either depletion of available protein C in plasma or decreased protein C synthesis (caused by administration of vitamin K antagonists, severe liver failure or complications of prematurity).
Severe acute sepsis.
Purpura fulminans is a presenting feature of severe acute sepsis, such as Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Group A and B Streptococci, and less commonly with Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, "Capnocytophaga canimorsus" or Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) infections, particularly in individuals with asplenia.
Combination of sepsis and partial congenital defect.
In some cases, a combination of sepsis and a partial congenital defect in the protein C anticoagulant pathway initiates purpura fulminans.
Unknown.
In rare instances, purpura fulminans is an autoimmune manifestation against protein C or protein S after normally benign infections, such as chicken pox. Sometimes purpura fulminans has unknown cause.
Pathophysiology.
Regardless of the underlying cause of purpura fulminans, the mechanism of disease is similar with deficiency in protein C concentration or decrease in protein C activity which promotes blood clotting (thrombosis).
In cases of severe sepsis, there is widespread activation of the acute systemic inflammatory response, including activation of the coagulation and complement pathways, as well as endothelial dysfunction. Activated protein C helps regulate the systemic inflammatory response. During sepsis, signalling by the inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor, mediate altered protein transcription in the systemic inflammatory response, resulting in decreased synthesis of the regulatory proteins antithrombin, protein C and protein S, with increased synthesis of prothrombotic proteins Factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, and fibrinogen. Activated protein C binds to endothelial protein C receptor and subsequently cleaves the endothelial cell protease activated receptor-1, not only altering coagulation profiles but down-regulating pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic mediators, up-regulation of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic pathways and stabilization of the endothelial cell barrier functions.
Systemic coagulation activation may lead to depletion of circulating coagulation factors and platelets, which subsequently lead to bleeding. In early purpura fulminans, lesion progression correlates with the histological appearance of blockage of small skin blood vessels with blood clots causing capillary dilation and congestion with red blood cells. In later stage lesions, there is irreversible endothelial ischaemic injury with extravasation of blood cells into the dermis and gangrenous necrosis, sometimes with secondary infection.
The depletion of anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory proteins, in particular, protein C and its co-factor, protein S, may also promote thrombus formation, inhibit fibrinolysis and lead to further activation of the inflammatory pathways.
Diagnosis.
Early purpura fulminans lesions look similar to traumatic skin bleeds or purpuric rashes, such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; however, purpura fulminans will rapidly progress to necrosis whereas other purpuric rashes do not. In most cases, differential diagnoses may be distinguished from purpura fulminans by other clinical and laboratory findings.
The initial appearance of purpura fulminans lesions is of well-demarcated erythematous lesions which progress rapidly to develop irregular central areas of blue-black haemorrhagic necrosis. Advancing areas of necrosis are often surrounded by a thin border of erythaema that fades into adjacent unaffected skin. Haemorrhage into the necrotic skin causes purpura fulminans lesions to become painful, dark and raised, sometimes with vesicle or blister (bulla) formation.
The distribution of purpura fulminans lesions may be different according to the underlying pathogenesis. Purpura fulminans in severe sepsis typically develops in the distal extremities and progresses proximally or appears as a generalised or diffuse rash affecting the whole body surface. In cases of severe inheritable protein C deficiency, purpura fulminans with disseminated intravascular coagulation manifests within a few hours or days after birth.
Laboratory investigations.
The cardinal features of purpura investigations are the same as those of disseminated intravascular coagulation: prolonged plasma clotting times, thrombocytopenia, reduced plasma fibrinogen concentration, increased plasma fibrin-degradation products and occasionally microangiopathic haemolysis.
Prevention.
For people who have severe congenital protein C deficiency, protein C replacement therapies are available, which is indicated and approved for use in the United States and Europe for the prevention of purpura fulminans. Protein C replacement is often in combination with anticoagulation therapy of injectable low molecular weight heparin or oral warfarin. Before initiating warfarin therapy, a few days of therapeutic heparin may be administered to prevent warfarin necrosis and other progressive or recurrent thrombotic complications.
Complications of prevention.
The amount of fresh frozen plasma required to reverse disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with purpura fulminans may lead to complications of fluid overload and death, especially in neonates, such as transfusion-related acute lung injury. Exposure to multiple plasma donors over time increases the cumulative risk for transfusion-associated viral infection and allergic reaction to donor proteins found in fresh frozen plasma.
Allergic reactions and alloantibody formation are also potential complications, as with any protein replacement therapy.
Concomitant warfarin therapy in subjects with congenital protein C deficiency is associated with an increased risk of warfarin skin necrosis.
Treatment.
Early stage sepsis-associated purpura fulminans may be reversible with quick therapeutic intervention. Treatment is mainly removing the underlying cause and degree of clotting abnormalities and with supportive treatment (antibiotics, volume expansion, tissue oxygenation, etc.). Thus, treatment includes aggressive management of the septic state.
Purpura fulminans with disseminated intravascular coagulation should be urgently treated with fresh frozen plasma (10–20 mL/kg every 8–12 hours) and/or protein C concentrate to replace pro-coagulant and anticoagulant plasma proteins that have been depleted by the disseminated intravascular coagulation process.
Protein C in plasma in the steady state has a half life of 6- to 10-hour, therefore, patients with severe protein C deficiency and presenting with purpura fulminans can be treated acutely with an initial bolus of protein C concentrate 100 IU/kg followed by 50 IU /kg every 6 hours. A total of 1 IU/kg of protein C concentrate or 1 mL/kg of fresh frozen plasma will increase the plasma concentration of protein C by 1 IU/dL. Cases with comorbid pathological bleeding may require additional transfusions with platelet concentrate (10–15 mL/kg) or cryoprecipitate (5 mL/kg).
Established soft tissue necrosis may require surgical removal of the dead tissue, fasciotomy, amputation or reconstructive surgery.
Prognosis.
Purpura fulminans lesions, once established, often progress within 24 to 48 hours to full-thickness skin necrosis or soft-tissue necrosis. Once purpura fulminans lesions progress to full-thickness skin necrosis, healing takes between 4–8 weeks and leaves large scars.
Without treatment, necrotic soft tissue may become gangrenous, leading to loss of limbs. Purpura fulminans is often accompanied by micro-vascular thrombosis and haemorrhagic infarction in other tissues, such as the lungs, kidneys, central nervous system and adrenal glands, leading to multiple organ failure, and causes initial high mortality and long-term morbidity in survivors. Purpura fulminans may also lead to severe large vessel venous thrombosis if untreated in its early stages.
Purpura fulminans secondary to severe infection is self-limiting. In cases of homozygous protein C deficiency, episodes of purpura fulminans and other thrombotic events are recurrent. Moreover, infant survival due to maintenance replacement therapy is often associated with intellectual disability or visual impairment. For post-infection purpura fulminans, new lesions will occur while neutralising autoantibodies are present (1–2 weeks after presentation).
A multi-disciplinary care team is usually required for rehabilitation after purpura fulminans.
Epidemiology.
Purpura fulminans is rare and most commonly occurs in babies and small children but can also be a rare manifestation in adults when it is associated with severe infections. For example, Meningococcal septicaemia is complicated by purpura fulminans in 10–20% of cases among children. Purpura fulminans associated with congenital (inherited) protein C deficiency occurs in 1:500,000–1,000,000 live births.
Research and case studies.
Due to the rarity of purpura fulminans and its occurrence in vulnerable patient groups like children research on the condition is very limited and evidence based knowledge is scarce. 
Case studies:
Capnocytophaga canimorsus 
Klebsiella oxytoca
Neisseria meningitidis
History.
Purpura fulminans was first described by Guelliot in 1884.

Gustav Fröhlich

Gustav Friedrich Fröhlich (21 March 1902 – 22 December 1987) was a German actor and film director. He landed secondary roles in a number of films and plays before landing his breakthrough role of Freder Fredersen in Fritz Lang's 1927 film "Metropolis". He remained a popular film star in Germany until the 1950s.
Early life and career.
Gustav Fröhlich was born an illegitimate child in Hanover and was raised by foster parents. Before becoming an actor, he worked for a short time as an editor of a provincial newspaper and as the author of popular novels. During World War I, he also volunteered for duty in occupied Brussels as a press supervisor.
Weimar Republic.
Gustav Fröhlich began his stage career in the early 1920s at minor theatres in Germany. He quickly achieved more important roles and appeared as "The Prince of Homburg" at the Deutsche Theater under the direction of Max Reinhardt. 
One of Fröhlich's first film roles was composer Franz Liszt in "Paganini" in 1922. This was followed by a string of bit parts and supporting roles in films. 
He landed his breakthrough role as the "dashing" Freder Fredersen in Fritz Lang's epic film "Metropolis" (1927). Fröhlich described Lang as a demanding director, recalling that "In scenes of physical discomfort, he tormented his actors until they did suffer".
Although the film itself was a financial failure, it established him as a leading film star in Germany. He was also notable for his appearance in "Asphalt" (1929), in which his restrained performance is still impressive today. In 1930, he was called to Hollywood to play roles in German versions of American films such as "Die heilige Flamme" and "Kismet". He often appeared in musicals or comedies as a romantic hero and smart gentleman.
Third Reich.
In 1933, Fröhlich directed the film "Rakoczy-Marsch", in which he also portrayed the leading role. He would direct another seven films and was screenwriter on five, until the 1950s.
During the Third Reich, Gustav Fröhlich remained one of the foremost male stars in German film (along with Hans Albers, Willy Fritsch and Heinz Rühmann). Between 1931 and 1935, Fröhlich was married to Hungarian opera star, and actress Gitta Alpár, with whom he had a child, Julika. 
For a time, he lived with the actress Lida Baarova until she became involved with the Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels. 
There is also an unconfirmed story that Fröhlich slapped Goebbels in a fit of jealous rage. In 1937, he rented his house in Berchtesgaden to Hitler's architect, Albert Speer. In 1941, he served in the Wehrmacht "Landschützen-Regiment" and in the same year, married Maria Hajek. They remained married until her death in 1987.
Later life.
Gustav Fröhlich was seldom involved in Nazi propaganda films, a fact that helped him to establish a new film career after World War II. He remained a busy actor after the war but his roles changed from leading men to supporting parts as he got older. His best-known role during this time was perhaps in "Die Sünderin" (1951) with Hildegard Knef, in which Fröhlich portrayed a terminally ill painter. "Die Sünderin" caused a scandal because of its open treatment of several taboos such as nudity, suicide and euthanasia.
Fröhlich retired from the film business in 1956, but he still managed to make occasional film and television appearances until the early 1980s. In 1973, he received the German Film Award for Lifetime Achievements. From 1956, Fröhlich lived in Lugano, Switzerland, where he died in 1987, from complications after surgery.

Carmen Calvo

María del Carmen Calvo Poyato (born 9 June 1957) is a Spanish politician and author who served as Deputy Prime Minister of Spain and Minister of the Presidency from 2018 to 2021.
Born and raised in Cabra, Spain, she attended the University of Seville and the University of Córdoba; she holds a doctorate in constitutional law from the latter institution. She was Regional Minister of Culture of Andalusia between 1996 and 2004. She also served between 2004 and 2007 as Minister of Culture in the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. From June 2017 to October 2021, she served as Secretary of Equality of the Socialist Party. She has published several books about feminism and gender equality.
Early life and education.
Calvo's primary studies were carried out at a Catholic school and her high school studies at the Aguilar and Eslava High School in the province of Córdoba. She studied law at the University of Seville and got her doctorate in constitutional law in the University of Córdoba.
Calvo took a leave of absence from being professor of constitutional law at the University of Córdoba. At the university, she was Secretary General and vice-dean of the Faculty of Law between 1990 and 1994. From 1992 to 1996 she was secretary of the Andalusian Interuniversity Institute of Criminology.
Political career.
Calvo entered politics in the 1990s, when she was appointed Counselor of the Economic and Social Council of Córdoba between 1994 and 1996. She joined the Socialist Workers' Party in 1999.
Regional Minister of Culture of Andalusia.
In April 1996, Calvo was appointed Minister of Culture of the Regional Government of Andalusia under the presidency of Manuel Chaves. Having joined the Socialist Workers' Party in 1999, she was elected MP for Córdoba in the Parliament of Andalusia in 2000. She was in office between her appointment in 1996 until her appointment as Culture Minister of the Government of Spain.
During her eight-years-term as Regional Minister of Culture, Calvo inaugurated the Museo Picasso Málaga of contemporary art in 2003, she negotiated the Andalusian Pact for the Book —a pact for supporting and promoting of reading— and she carried out important investments to reform churches, libraries and theatres —like Maestranza Theatre of Seville— as well as developing the Quality Plan for the Museums of Andalusia —which included the enlargement of the Archelogic Museum of Córdoba.
In 2004 Calvo debuted in the big screen with director José Luis García Sánchez with a short role in the movie "María querida".
Minister of Culture.
In January 2004, she made the leap to national politics when the Secretary-General of the Socialist Workers' Party, Zapatero, created a "committee of notables" to advise him on his run to the premiership and appointed her a member of that committee. In the Spanish general election in March 2004, she was elected to the Congress of Deputies, representing Córdoba. She was subsequently appointed Minister of Culture in April by the new Prime Minister of Spain, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.
As Minister of Culture, Calvo was an outspoken opponent of copyright piracy, and in 2005 her department spent around one million euros on a campaign to educate the public about the importance of intellectual property. However, she was criticised by music industry officials for her statement that intellectual property is "not an absolute right". Her decision to transfer documents from the General Archive of the Spanish Civil War to the Autonomous community of Catalonia was controversial.
Because of the bad results of the previous year in the Spanish cinema, in 2007 Calvo presented a draft law that forces the movie theaters to shown European films (at least a 25%). This was rejected by most of the film industry and they went to strike on 18 June 2007, a strike followed by a 93% of the industry. Minister Calvo was replaced in July 2007 and her successor approved this law with big modifications in late 2007.
She was one of the ministers with worst approval ratings and was replaced in July 2007 by César Antonio Molina.
First Vice President of the Congress.
After leaving the Ministry, Calvo was elected First Vice President of the Congress of Deputies, a position she held until the end of the congressional session.
In the 2008 general election, Calvo was re-elected MP for Córdoba and was appointed Chair of the Congress Committee on Equality, as well as becoming a member of the Congress Committee on Defence and Committee on Comprehensive Disability Policies. She also presided over two subcommittees, one on abortion and other about gender violence.
Calvo did not run for re-election in the 2011 general election due to her disagreement with the choice to put Rosa Aguilar at the top of the electoral list in Córdoba. She returned to her post as professor of constitutional law in the University of Córdoba. She later gained the confidence of Secretary-General of the Socialist Party Pedro Sánchez and in 2017 he appointed her Secretary for Equality of the Socialist Workers' Party.
Deputy Prime Minister.
On 5 June 2018 it was announced that Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez would appoint Calvo as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Presidency, Relations with the Cortes and Equality. This was the first time that the Ministry of the Presidency also took the equality portfolio. She was sworn in before the King at Palace of Zarzuela on 7 June 2018.
During her term, Calvo focused on gender-based violence, especially in the wake of the La Manada rape case. In this so-called "wolf pack" case in which a group of men attacked an 18-year-old woman, the Provincial Court of Navarre convicted the men of sexual abuse —nine years in prison— and not for sexual assault or rape —that would mean at least 20 years. The Court's decision provoked widespread social unrest. Calvo proposed a reform of the Criminal Code to include explicit sexual consent. After appealing the sentence, the High Court of Justice of Navarre confirmed the sentence of the provincial court.
In November 2018, Calvo also proposed to amend to the Constitution to exclude some words that can be considered offensive for disabled people and to create a constitutional mandate that specifically protects disabled women. In October 2019, she was an outspoken proponent of exhuming the remains of Francisco Franco from Valle de los Caídos.
On 13 January 2020 she was sworn in again as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Presidency in the Sánchez Second Cabinet, losing the Ministry of Equality in favor of Irene Montero.
In June 2021, Calvo reaffirmed during an interview with "La Vanguardia" that the pardons of Catalonian independence politicians were near and asked the People's Party not to "confront Catalonia (because) the only alternative was normalizing relations and stop the tremendous confrontation provoked by independentism, the Spanish right and stabilize the situation".
In 2022, a report was issued that claimed that President Sánchez offered Calvo the position of President of the Council of State after dismissing her as Vice President of the Government.
Later career.
When the Spanish parliament approved the creation of a sick leave for women suffering from incapacitating periods, becoming the first country in Europe to do so, Calvo notably was one of three PSOE lawmakers's who abstained from the vote in February 2023.
Personal life.
Calvo is the sister of the politician and writer , former MP of the Parliament of Andalusia and former Mayor of Cabra.
At the age of 19, she married her childhood sweetheart, with whom she had a daughter at the age of 22. She and her daughter share a love for rock music. Subsequently, she married sociologist Manuel Pérez Yruela, former spokesperson of the Regional Government of Andalusia and researcher professor of the Institute of Social Studies of Andalusia. They divorced. She has two granddaughters.
On 25 March 2020, Calvo tested positive for COVID-19 and was hospitalized with a respiratory infection during the first wave of the pandemic. "Público" announced that Calvo had recovered from the illness in May 2020.
She is a fan of bullfighting.

Mexico national cricket team

The Mexican national cricket team represents the country of Mexico in international cricket. They became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2004. Their international debut was in 2006 against Costa Rica. The team made their ICC Americas Championship debut in June 2010 and in 2011 participated in the ICC Americas Division 3 tournament in Costa Rica. Mexico has also participated in the South American Championship in 2014 and 2018 winning both the time. In 2017, they became an associate member.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Mexico and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.
History.
Mexico became an affiliate member of the ICC in 2004. Their first international match was played on 19 March 2006 in the Central American Cricket Championship against Costa Rica who they beat. Prior to this there had been teams based in Mexico City that had played against Belize but these were not recognised as international fixtures. Having beaten Costa Rica in the tournament they then lost to Belize finishing second.
In 2007, Mexico hosted the Central American Cricket Championship and won it by defeating Costa Rica and El Salvador.
In 2008, Mexico travelled to El Salvador to take part in the 2nd Easter Cup. They finished second, losing to Belize but winning easily against El Salvador.
Mexico took part in the 3rd Central American Championship in 2009 in Panama under the new Twenty20 format. Mexico performed well in the tournament, winning all but one of their matches and even defeating close rivals Belize in a close fought match. As a result, they finished 2nd in the tournament.
In 2011, Mexico competed in the ICC Division 3 Americas tournament in Costa Rica finishing in 4th place.
In 2012, a youthful Mexico team participated in the 4th Volcano Cup in El Salvador finishing runners up to the hosts after defeating Guatemala.
2018-present.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Mexico and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.
Mexico played their first ever Twenty20 International match against Belize in the 2019 Central American Cricket Championship.

Amedeo Amadei

Amedeo Amadei (; 26 July 1921 – 24 November 2013) was a professional Italian football player and manager, who played as a striker. Following his death in 2013, he was one of eleven members to be inducted into the A.S. Roma Hall of Fame. A fast and powerful forward, with a good touch, he is considered to be one of the best Italian strikers of all time. Amadei was known for his ability to run forward with the ball from midfield and find spaces in the opposing defence, as well as his prolific goalscoring, acrobatic ability in the air, and precise volleying, which allowed him to excel in the centre-forward role; due to his importance to Roma throughout his career, he was affectionately known by the fans as the "eighth King of Rome".
Club career.
Amadei was born in Frascati, near Rome, the son of a baker, which earned him the nickname "Fornaretto." He made his professional debut on 2 May 1937 with A.S. Roma aged 15 years and 280 days (the youngest debut in Serie A history; surpassed on 12 May 2021 by Wisdom Amey) in a 2–2 draw against Fiorentina. A week later he scored in a 5–1 defeat to A.S. Lucchese Libertas 1905 on 9 May 1937, making him the youngest scorer in Serie A history, a record he holds to this day. He also played in Serie B with Atalanta B.C., Inter and S.S.C. Napoli. He won one Italian title with Roma in the 1941–42 season; this was the club's first ever championship. With A.S. Roma he played 386 matches and scored 101 goals in the Italian top flight, as well as 11 in the Coppa Italia in 18 appearances, 16 goals in eight appearances in the 1944 Campionato Alta Italia, and 15 goals in 34 appearances in the 1945–46 Italian Football "After War" Championship; in his entire career he played 423 matches and scored 174 goals in Serie A, with a total of 508 appearances and 209 goals coming in league play.
International career.
Amadei represented the Italian national team on 13 occasions between 1949 and 1953, scoring 7 goals; he made his international debut on 27 March 1949, and scored his side's third goal in a 3–1 friendly away win over Spain at the Santiago Bernabéu. The following year, he participated in the 1950 FIFA World Cup with Italy, where he made one appearance during the tournament, in a 2–0 win over Paraguay.
Coaching career.
Following his retirement in 1956, Amadei worked as a coach for Napoli, the club with which he retired. He later also coached Lucchese, and the Italy women's national football team.

Paul McGregor (rugby league)

Paul McGregor (born 31 December 1967) is an Australian professional rugby league coach who was until August 2020, the head coach of the St. George Illawarra Dragons in the NRL, and a former professional rugby league footballer who played as a in the 1990s and 2000s.
McGregor played his club football for the Illawarra Steelers and the St. George Illawarra Dragons at the commencement of their joint venture in 1999. He remained with the club and was appointed interim coach following the sacking of Steve Price part-way through the 2014 NRL season. He played for the Country Origin, New South Wales and Australia at international level.
McGregor was the assistant coach for the New South Wales Blues between 2021 and 2023.
Background.
McGregor was born in Dapto, New South Wales, Australia.
Playing career.
McGregor played five seasons of first grade at Dapto before being signed by the Steelers at age 23 in 1991. He made his first grade debut in round 1 against the Penrith Panthers at WIN Stadium on 17 March.
McGregor represented the NSW Blues in fourteen State of Origin games between 1992 and 1998. He was a powerful runner of the football out wide and provided a great combination with his club teammate, Blues winger Rod Wishart.
Paul McGregor made his Test debut for Australia from the bench in a one-off Test against France on 6 July 1994, scoring a try in the Kangaroos record 58–0 win at the Parramatta Stadium in Sydney. At the end of the 1994 NSWRL season, he was selected to the 1994 Kangaroo tour, though his tour came to a premature end with a hamstring injury suffered in the Kangaroos 80–2 win over the Sheffield Eagles.
He was Man of the Match in Game II of the 1997 State of Origin series.
He had played 124 games with the Steelers club from 1991 to 1998, scoring 44 tries. He was a part of the Steelers 1992 Tooheys Challenge winning side that defeated the Brisbane Broncos.
McGregor was the foundation captain of the St. George Illawarra joint venture from 1999, leading the team into the 1999 NRL Grand Final against the Melbourne Storm. He spent time on the sidelines with injury that year and following a shoulder reconstruction he did not play during the entire 2000 NRL season. McGregor returned to the club in 2001 on an incentive based contract and retired at the end of the season, having played 34 games with the joint venture club.
McGregor was side-lined by a shoulder injury and so could not represent Scotland at the 2000 Rugby League World Cup
In 2011, the Illawarra Rugby League's centenary year, McGregor was named at centre in the Illawarra 'team of the century'.
Coaching career.
McGregor joined the St. George Illawarra's coaching staff in 2002 as a strength and conditioning coach, a position he also held with the NSW Blues.
In 2009, with Wayne Bennett joining the club, McGregor left and took up the head coaching job at the Western Suburbs Red Devils club in the Illawarra Rugby League competition.
McGregor coached the Illawarra NSW Cup team in 2012 and 2013 before taking up the assistant position at St. George Illawarra. His successor at the Illawarra Cutters was another former Illawarra player, Ian Millward.
Following the announcement of the sacking of incumbent first grade coach, Steve Price, McGregor was elevated to coach of the top tier team in May 2014, initially until the end of the 2014 season. Following improved form, McGregor was announced as the full-time head coach for the next three seasons until the end of 2017.
In 2015, McGregor coached St. George Illawarra to finish in 8th position. This was the club's first finals appearance since 2011.
In 2017, many predicted St. George Illawarra go finish in the bottom four, due to a disappointing 2016 season, where the club were extremely poor in attack. In Round 1 2017, St. George Illawarra beat Penrith 42–10. St. George Illawarra would go on to lose in Round 2, but win the next 5 games in a row. Due to improved form, the McGregor was re-signed by the club on 8 June 2017, until the end of 2019. In the second half of the 2017 season, St. George Illawarra suffered a terrible drop in form with the club winning only 4 of the last 11 matches. This drop in form culminated with the club losing against Canterbury in the last round of the regular season. Before the match, St. George Illawarra only needed victory over their lower placed opponents to qualify for the finals as North Queensland had lost the earlier match. Due to St. George Illawarra losing the game, North Queensland went on to finish in 8th place and qualify for the finals. This eventually lead to North Queensland reaching the 2017 NRL Grand Final.
In the 2018 season, McGregor guided St. George Illawarra to a 7th-place finish as they qualified for the finals. At one point, they were sitting equal first on the ladder after 20 rounds but for the third season in a row, the club suffered a late season form slump winning just 4 from the remaining 11 matches. McGregor himself came under criticism for the form slump with some sections of the media claiming his job was on the line. In week one of the finals, the Saints faced Brisbane at Suncorp Stadium with the home side being heavily fancied before the match. St. George Illawarra went on to defeat Brisbane 48–18. The following week, St. George Illawarra played South Sydney in the second elimination final. They led late until the end of the match when Adam Reynolds kicked three field goals to win the match for Souths 13–12.
On 18 April 2019, McGregor was granted a two-year contract extension by St. George Illawarra, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2021 season. After St. George Illawarra's 40–18 defeat against Penrith in Round 18 of the 2019 NRL season which left St. George Illawarra in 14th position on the ladder, McGregor came under intense media criticism after he chose to rest Ben Hunt for the game.
In the 2019 NRL season, McGregor coached the joint venture to their worst finish; 15th place. The only thing keeping St. George Illawarra from 16th place were the Gold Coast Titans. McGregor was given a contract extension after the club won four of their first six games. McGregor led the club to win just 4 of their last 18 games, a period which included five-match losing streaks from rounds 7–11 and again from rounds 16–20.
In the COVID-19 interrupted 2020 NRL season, the St. George Illawarra side lost its first four matches, including a 0-18 loss to a weakened New Zealand Warriors team, and a 22-2 loss to the last-placed Canterbury-Bankstown side, leading to renewed speculation about McGregor's future.
On 13 August 2020, McGregor was terminated as head coach St. George Illawarra. He won his final game on 14 August 2020 when his side upset the Parramatta Eels with a tough 14-12 win.
On September 15 2021, McGregor was appointed an assistant coach of the NSW Blues.
On November 5 2021, McGregor joined the Parramatta Eels coaching staff as a consultant for the 2022 NRL Season. McGregor did not renew his position following the Eels' loss at the 2022 NRL Grand Final.
On 28 September 2023, it was announced that the NSWRL board had decided not to renew McGregor's contract following another series defeat.
Following the conclusion of the 2023 NRL Season, McGregor held talks with the North Queensland Cowboys about the joining the club as an assistant to Head Coach Todd Payten. Citing family reasons, McGregor ultimately rejected the assistant role.

Factor VIII (medication)

Factor VIII, an essential blood coagulation protein, is used as a medication to treat and prevent bleeding in people with hemophilia A and other causes of low factor VIII. Certain preparations may also be used in those with von Willebrand's disease. It is given by slow injection into a vein.
Side effects include skin flushing, shortness of breath, fever, and red blood cell breakdown. Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis may occur. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the fetus. A purified factor VIII concentrate is made from human blood plasma. A recombinant version is also available. People may develop antibodies to factor VIII such that this medication becomes less effective.
Factor VIII was first identified in the 1940s and became available as a medication in the 1960s. Recombinant factor VIII was first made in 1984 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1992. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
Available forms.
Factor VIII is delivered by intravenous infusion.
History.
This transfer of a plasma byproduct into the blood stream of a hemophiliac often led to the transmission of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis before purification methods were improved. In the early 1990s, pharmaceutical companies began to produce recombinant synthesized factor products, which now prevent nearly all forms of disease transmission during replacement therapy.
Society and culture.
Legal status.
von Willebrand Factor/Coagulation Factor VIII Complex (Human) (sold under the brand name Wilate) was approved for medical use in the United States in 2009.
Economics.
The cost of Factor VIII and similar clotting factors has been described as "highly expensive". The cost of the clotting factors is 80% of all medical costs for people with hemophilia. They are so expensive that gene therapy for haemophilia might be less expensive, especially for people with severe hemophilia.

Namco Bandai Partners

Namco Bandai Partners S.A.S. (formerly Distribution Partners SAS) was a video game distribution company that was an amalgamation of several former Atari SA (formerly known as Infogrames Entertainment SA) offices located in PAL territories, which were acquired beginning in 2009 by Bandai Namco Holdings.
History.
Atari and Namco had long maintained a cross-publishing relationship that can be traced back to the very origins of Namco, and Atari's liquidation of regional assets was a natural opportunity for Namco Bandai to gain a PAL distribution network.
On September 9, 2008, Infogrames and Namco Bandai Games Europe announced a new joint-venture known as Distribution Partners. The distribution arms of both businesses were regrouped into a standalone entity with exclusive physical packaged-goods distribution rights for video games produced by Namco Bandai and Infogrames within Infogrames European and Asian territories. Along the way, Namco Bandai's parent company acquired a 34% stake in Atari's European and Asian businesses. The acquisitions came on the heels of Infogrames and Atari's financial difficulties, which had begun to snowball in 2006. The venture would trade worldwide, excluding North America and Japan.
On March 25, 2009, Atari announced they would leave the European and Asian markets and sell off their 66% stake in Distribution Partners within the next four months to Namco Bandai Games, although they would still retain a five-year distribution deal in the venture. This move was done so Atari could focus on the MMO market. The purchase was completed on July 7, and Distribution Partners was renamed Namco Bandai Partners in immediate effect, alongside all of Atari's European and Australian distribution subsidiaries being renamed under the Namco Bandai Partners umbrella as well. Because of the existing distribute deal planned beforehand, Namco Bandai Partners would continue to distribute Atari's games, which included titles such as "Champions Online". and also distribute titles from other publishers, such as "Cities XL" from Monte Cristo.
On April 16, 2010, it was announced that the company had signed an agreement deal with Sony Computer Entertainment to allow them to distribute and publish the game "Demon's Souls" for PAL-region territories. This followed news after Sony's European publishing division and Atlus, who published the game in North America, made announcements that they had no plans to bring the title over to PAL-regions.
On 1 July 2013, Namco Bandai Partners merged its operations with Namco Bandai Games Europe, with the latter now handling distribution of games through both Europe and Australia. This was done out of the parent company's desire in merging its publishing and distribution divisions together to help unify the Namco Bandai brand.

<doc id="6959754" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6959754" title="Locally connected space">
Locally connected space

In topology and other branches of mathematics, a topological space "X" is
locally connected if every point admits a neighbourhood basis consisting of open connected sets.
As a stronger notion, the space "X" is locally path connected if every point admits a neighbourhood basis consisting of open path connected sets.
Background.
Throughout the history of topology, connectedness and compactness have been two of the most
widely studied topological properties. Indeed, the study of these properties even among subsets of Euclidean space, and the recognition of their independence from the particular form of the Euclidean metric, played a large role in clarifying the notion of a topological property and thus a topological space. However, whereas the structure of "compact" subsets of Euclidean space was understood quite early on via the Heine–Borel theorem, "connected" subsets of formula_1 (for "n" &gt; 1) proved to be much more complicated. Indeed, while any compact Hausdorff space is locally compact, a connected space—and even a connected subset of the Euclidean plane—need not be locally connected (see below).
This led to a rich vein of research in the first half of the twentieth century, in which topologists studied the implications between increasingly subtle and complex variations on the notion of a locally connected space. As an example, the notion of "connectedness im kleinen" at a point and its relation to local connectedness will be considered later on in the article.
In the latter part of the twentieth century, research trends shifted to more intense study of spaces like manifolds, which are locally well understood (being locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space) but have complicated global behavior. By this it is meant that although the basic point-set topology of manifolds is relatively simple (as manifolds are essentially metrizable according to most definitions of the concept), their algebraic topology is far more complex. From this modern perspective, the stronger property of local path connectedness turns out to be more important: for instance, in order for a space to admit a universal cover it must be connected and locally path connected.
A space is locally connected if and only if for every open set , the connected components of (in the subspace topology) are open. It follows, for instance, that a continuous function from a locally connected space to a totally disconnected space must be locally constant. In fact the openness of components is so natural that one must be sure to keep in mind that it is not true in general: for instance Cantor space is totally disconnected but not discrete.
Definitions.
Let formula_2 be a topological space, and let formula_3 be a point of formula_4
A space formula_2 is called locally connected at formula_3 if every neighborhood of formula_3 contains a connected "open" neighborhood of formula_3, that is, if the point formula_3 has a neighborhood base consisting of connected open sets. A locally connected space is a space that is locally connected at each of its points.
Local connectedness does not imply connectedness (consider two disjoint open intervals in formula_10 for example); and connectedness does not imply local connectedness (see the topologist's sine curve).
A space formula_2 is called locally path connected at formula_3 if every neighborhood of formula_3 contains a path connected "open" neighborhood of formula_3, that is, if the point formula_3 has a neighborhood base consisting of path connected open sets. A locally path connected space is a space that is locally path connected at each of its points.
Locally path connected spaces are locally connected. The converse does not hold (see the lexicographic order topology on the unit square).
Connectedness im kleinen.
A space formula_2 is called connected im kleinen at formula_3 or weakly locally connected at formula_3 if every neighborhood of formula_3 contains a connected (not necessarily open) neighborhood of formula_3, that is, if the point formula_3 has a neighborhood base consisting of connected sets. A space is called weakly locally connected if it is weakly locally connected at each of its points; as indicated below, this concept is in fact the same as being locally connected.
A space that is locally connected at formula_3 is connected im kleinen at formula_23 The converse does not hold, as shown for example by a certain infinite union of decreasing broom spaces, that is connected im kleinen at a particular point, but not locally connected at that point. However, if a space is connected im kleinen at each of its points, it is locally connected.
A space formula_2 is said to be path connected im kleinen at formula_3 if every neighborhood of formula_3 contains a path connected (not necessarily open) neighborhood of formula_3, that is, if the point formula_3 has a neighborhood base consisting of path connected sets.
A space that is locally path connected at formula_3 is path connected im kleinen at formula_23 The converse does not hold, as shown by the same infinite union of decreasing broom spaces as above. However, if a space is path connected im kleinen at each of its points, it is locally path connected.
First examples.
A first-countable Hausdorff space formula_35 is locally path-connected if and only if formula_36 is equal to the final topology on formula_2 induced by the set formula_38 of all continuous paths formula_39
Properties.
For the non-trivial direction, assume formula_2 is weakly locally connected. To show it is locally connected, it is enough to show that the connected components of open sets are open.
Let formula_41 be open in formula_2 and let formula_43 be a connected component of formula_44 Let formula_3 be an element of formula_46 Then formula_41 is a neighborhood of formula_3 so that there is a connected neighborhood formula_49 of formula_3 contained in formula_44 Since formula_49 is connected and contains formula_53 formula_49 must be a subset of formula_43 (the connected component containing formula_3). Therefore formula_3 is an interior point of formula_46 Since formula_3 was an arbitrary point of formula_60 formula_43 is open in formula_4 Therefore, formula_2 is locally connected.
Components and path components.
The following result follows almost immediately from the definitions but will be quite useful:
Lemma: Let "X" be a space, and formula_70 a family of subsets of "X". Suppose that formula_71 is nonempty. Then, if each formula_72 is connected (respectively, path connected) then the union formula_73 is connected (respectively, path connected).
Now consider two relations on a topological space "X": for formula_74 write:
Evidently both relations are reflexive and symmetric. Moreover, if "x" and "y" are contained in a connected (respectively, path connected) subset "A" and "y" and "z" are connected in a connected (respectively, path connected) subset "B", then the Lemma implies that formula_77 is a connected (respectively, path connected) subset containing "x", "y" and "z". Thus each relation is an equivalence relation, and defines a partition of "X" into equivalence classes. We consider these two partitions in turn.
For "x" in "X", the set formula_78 of all points "y" such that formula_79 is called the connected component of "x". The Lemma implies that formula_78 is the unique maximal connected subset of "X" containing "x". Since the closure of formula_78 is also a connected subset containing "x", it follows that formula_78 is closed.
If "X" has only finitely many connected components, then each component is the complement of a finite union of closed sets and therefore open. In general, the connected components need not be open, since, e.g., there exist totally disconnected spaces (i.e., formula_83 for all points "x") that are not discrete, like Cantor space. However, the connected components of a locally connected space are also open, and thus are clopen sets. It follows that a locally connected space "X" is a topological disjoint union formula_84 of its distinct connected components. Conversely, if for every open subset "U" of "X", the connected components of "U" are open, then "X" admits a base of connected sets and is therefore locally connected.
Similarly "x" in "X", the set formula_85 of all points "y" such that formula_86 is called the "path component" of "x". As above, formula_85 is also the union of all path connected subsets of "X" that contain "x", so by the Lemma is itself path connected. Because path connected sets are connected, we have formula_88 for all formula_89
However the closure of a path connected set need not be path connected: for instance, the topologist's sine curve is the closure of the open subset "U" consisting of all points "(x,sin(x))" with "x &gt; 0", and "U", being homeomorphic to an interval on the real line, is certainly path connected. Moreover, the path components of the topologist's sine curve "C" are "U", which is open but not closed, and formula_90 which is closed but not open.
A space is locally path connected if and only if for all open subsets "U", the path components of "U" are open. Therefore the path components of a locally path connected space give a partition of "X" into pairwise disjoint open sets. It follows that an open connected subspace of a locally path connected space is necessarily path connected. Moreover, if a space is locally path connected, then it is also locally connected, so for all formula_91 formula_78 is connected and open, hence path connected, that is, formula_93 That is, for a locally path connected space the components and path components coincide.
Quasicomponents.
Let "X" be a topological space. We define a third relation on "X": formula_109 if there is no separation of "X" into open sets "A" and "B" such that "x" is an element of "A" and "y" is an element of "B". This is an equivalence relation on "X" and the equivalence class formula_110 containing "x" is called the quasicomponent of "x".
formula_110 can also be characterized as the intersection of all clopen subsets of "X" that contain "x". Accordingly formula_110 is closed; in general it need not be open.
Evidently formula_113 for all formula_89 Overall we have the following containments among path components, components and quasicomponents at "x":
formula_115
If "X" is locally connected, then, as above, formula_78 is a clopen set containing "x", so formula_117 and thus formula_118 Since local path connectedness implies local connectedness, it follows that at all points "x" of a locally path connected space we have
formula_119
Another class of spaces for which the quasicomponents agree with the components is the class of compact Hausdorff spaces.

List of Lebanese in Syrian jails

This is a list of Lebanese citizens suspected to be detained in Syria (estimated to be 622).
Responses.
Syrian response.
In 2000, Syria released 54 Lebanese political prisoners. According to the Syrian government, these were all the Lebanese political prisoners under their control. The Syrian government also confirmed the existence of 88 Lebanese citizens under criminal sentences. The Syrian government claimed these people are not political prisoners due to the criminal sentences they are serving.
Rafic Hariri's response.
Before the 54 Lebanese prisoners were released from the Syrian side, lists that include around 260 Lebanese prisoners were being spread. According to Hariri, during a December 12, 2000 speech, these lists were inaccurate and would “make us remember all the civil war's terrible mess again”. He insisted Syria has released all Lebanese citizens it had, supporting Syria's claim.

Residential gateway

A residential gateway is a small consumer-grade gateway which bridges network access between connected local area network (LAN) hosts to a wide area network (WAN) (such as the Internet) via a modem, or directly connects to a WAN (as in EttH), while routing. The WAN is a larger computer network, generally operated by an Internet service provider.
History.
The term residential gateway was popularized by Clifford Holliday in 1997 through his paper entitled "The residential gateway".
Devices.
Multiple devices have been described as "residential gateways":
A modem (e.g. DSL modem, cable modem) by itself provides none of the functions of a router. It merely allows ATM or PPP or PPPoE traffic to be transmitted across telephone lines, cable wires, optical fibers, wireless radio frequencies, or other physical layers. On the receiving end is another modem that re-converts the transmission format back into digital data packets.
This allows network bridging using telephone, cable, optical, and radio connection methods. The modem also provides handshake protocols, so that the devices on each end of the connection are able to recognize each other. However, a modem generally provides few other network functions.
A cellular wireless access point can function in a similar fashion to a modem. It can allow a direct connection from a home LAN to a WWAN, if a wireless router or access point is present on the WAN as well and tethering is allowed.
Many modems now incorporate the features mentioned below and thus are appropriately described as residential gateways, such as some Internet providers which offer a cable modem router combo.
Features.
A residential gateway usually provides
It may also provide other functions such as Dynamic DNS, and converged triple play services such as TV and telephony.
Most gateways are self-contained components, using internally stored firmware. They are generally platform-independent, i.e., they can serve any operating system.
Wireless routers perform the same functions as a wired router and base station, but allow connectivity for wireless devices with the LAN, or as a bridge between the wireless router and another wireless router for a meshnet (the wireless router-wireless router connection can be within the LAN or can be between the LAN and WWAN).
Security.
Low-cost production and requirement for user friendliness make gateways vulnerable to network attacks, which resulted in large clusters of such devices being taken over and used to launch DDoS attacks. A majority of the vulnerabilities were present in the web administration frontends of the routers, allowing unauthorized control either via default passwords, vendor backdoors, or web vulnerabilities.

Tylosema esculentum

Tylosema esculentum, with common names gemsbok bean and marama bean or morama bean, is a long-lived perennial legume native to arid areas of southern Africa. Stems grow at least , in a prostrate or trailing form, with forked tendrils that facilitate climbing. A raceme up to long, containing many yellow-orange flowers, ultimately produces an ovate to circular pod, with large brownish-black seeds.
Form.
The marama bean is adapted to its native region of Southern Africa and therefore grows in dry and low-moisture soils. Its drought tolerance is accordingly high. The fact that the marama bean is adapted to harsh environments offers potential to extend the agricultural activity into regions which are dry or unproductive at the moment. Nevertheless, it needs to be investigated whether it can grow on different soil types. Summer growth is typically prodigious, particularly in plants older than one year, due in part to its large underground tuber. The plant is dormant over winter in its native home — South Africa, Namibia and Botswana — but might possibly remain evergreen in less harsh environments.
The nutritional value of the marama bean is astonishingly high for an unimproved legume. The tubers have a high protein content of 9.0% and also have a high amino acid content. The tubers of cassava, for comparison, only have a protein content of 1-3%, while yam has one of 7%. Also the grain is relatively high in protein with a share of 30-39%. The concentration of sulphur-containing amino acids is high as well (with a lysine content of 5.0% and a methionine content of 0.7%). This shows that the protein content of the seeds is comparable to the one of commercial soybeans, which have a content of 38-40%. Therefore, the potential of the marama bean is high to replace the soybean as a protein source, once there have been genetical improvements. The seeds develop in typical legume pods, albeit large and squat in shape, typically one or two seeds per pod.
The tuber can grow very large; commonly, at least , and often much larger. In Botswana, a tuber of has been found.
Uses.
The plant is a significant food-source for the people of the Kalahari because of the high protein and oil content of its large seeds ( each). The seeds are usually roasted, imbuing them with a more palatable flavour, comparable to cashew or chestnut. The seeds can also be ground or boiled. The beans keep well, due to their hard outer shell. The tuber is also edible, but must be harvested from young plants (one or two years old) to avoid the tuber being astringent and fibrous.
The flour of "Tylosema esculentum", prepared from heated or unheated marama beans, has a potential as a functional food ingredient. Although studies about its nutritional and physicochemical properties are lacking, the flour is protein-rich. Protein-based ingredients of marama bean are similar to those commercially available from soybean. Therefore, this flour has the potential to be used as a protein supplements in composite flours with cereals to improve the protein quality.
Marama milk.
The milk of the marama bean is a creamy white water extract, very similar to dairy milk or soymilk. The milk can be consumed in the form of a refreshing and nutritious beverage just like dairy milk or soymilk. However, it is not available commercially.
This milk has high levels of sodium (47.9 mg/100 g) and iron (3.7 mg/100 g) compared to soymilk and dairy milk, with much a lower calcium content (6.8 mg/100 g).
In order to produce marama milk, several processing steps are involved: Thermal treatment (blanching and roasting of the beans), cracking, milling, suspending in water, boiling and filtration to obtain a milk-like phase.
Forage.
The potential uses of the marama bean go beyond the role of only being a food plant. The foliage of the plant serves as forage for livestock and wildlife in Southern Africa because the leaves are highly palatable. Since the marama bean is used to grow in harsh environments it could be used as a feed crop in the drier parts of Africa. While using it as forage one does also protect the soil by conserving its moisture and preventing from soil erosion by wind and water. Furthermore, there would be a build-up in organic matter, which would be beneficial for soils which are poor in nutrients.
Propagation.
The seed's hard outer shell means that scarification is necessary in order to ensure satisfactory germination rates. As for most legumes, a pH neutral soil is preferred. The plant typically grows in very sandy loam, where waterlogging would not be a problem. Despite much global interest in this plant, propagation rates are still fairly low.
The plant can be grown outside, unsheltered, as far north as Zone 8 in the United States and perhaps further north; above-ground growth is killed back by winter freezing, but the plant reemerges each spring in late May. The greatest impediment to producing a crop of seeds is the long maturation time for the seed pods – which is right up to the first hard freeze of the year. Waterlogging is indeed an issue – leading to root rot – and a well-drained sandy loam is preferred, but not essential.
Curiously, this and the other three members of the genus "Tylosema" are possibly unique within the family Fabaceae in the fact they exhibit heterostyly. This reduces propagation potential, and obviously reduces seed production rates for cropping.
Pests.
It is known that two fungi are coinfecting the pods of marama beans leading to necrotic lesions. The fungi were revealed to be "Alternaria tenuissima" and "Phoma" spp.
Insect pests could have been observed causing seed damage.
Chemical and nutritional composition.
It is most common to eat the marama beans as mature beans when the seeds are surrounded by a hard and woody seed coat, which has a reddish to brownish color. But the beans can also be eaten when they are still immature green beans.
Moisture.
The marama bean has a very low moisture content as the dry matter content ranges from 93.4% to 98.7%. The moisture content may also vary due to external factors.
Lipids.
It was reported that the content of lipids ranges between 24% and 42%. This high amount of lipids is an advantage, especially in Southern Africa where it helps improving the status of the undernourished people. The lipid content of the marama beans can be compared to sunflower seeds (22-36 %) and rapeseed (22-49 %) and almost reaching the amount that is found in peanuts (45-55 %). The amount of lipids is twice as high as found in soybeans (17-20 %).
Protein.
The protein range of marama beans ranges from 29% to 39% on a dry matter basis. Thus, it is comparable or slightly higher to most other legumes. This amount of protein makes the marama bean a great nutritive food but can be also used as a protein-rich ingredient for supplementing other products.
Local and community uses.
"Tylosema esculentum", also known as the Marama bean, is a perennial legume that grows in arid Southern African environments. Indigenous natural food sources, such as this specific perennial legume, are essential for rural livelihoods, especially for communities living in extremely harsh environmental conditions where there is little to no rainfall. The plant's ability to be cultivated in harsh and arid environments is due to its large tuber structure that stores high amount of water and soil nutrients, making "Tylosema esculentum" a drought-tolerant crop. Many families of Southern African regions grow the Marama bean locally, but are unaware of its high nutritional value.
Sixteen samples of "Tylosema esculentum" from Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa were tested, and the plant's chemical composition was analyzed. The results showed that the Marama bean seeds contained high lipid and protein levels (29-38% protein content, 32-42% lipid content, and 19-27% dietary fiber content), which are higher in value than other legumes. "Tylosema esculentum" can also be used for other nutritional sources such as for oil, milk, and flour. After learning more about the benefits of nutrition of this perennial legume, many families hope to have the Marama bean as part of the commercial market in order to stabilize food security and improve food diversity.
Scarification and seed germination.
"Tylosema esculentum" have hard seed coats, which lead to many ecological benefits such as an accumulation of seed banks in soils and a higher percentage of germinating, establishing, and completing a successful life cycle. In order to optimize germination and growth of this perennial legume and increase its importance in the food market, germination behavior of untreated "Tylosema esculentum" seeds compared to seeds undergoing various dormancy-breaking treatments was investigated. The results indicated that seed germination was greatest when scratching and cracking of the seed coat with sandpaper, also known as mechanical scarification, was applied. Other types of scarification include immersion of seed in water or acid.
Another experiment in Greece discovered that the seed germination of "Tylosema esculentum" increases significantly in speed and emergence when the seeds are immersed in hot water for two to four minutes or dry heating for five minutes at 100 to 150 degrees Celsius. Soil is also an important factor to consider when growing this perennial legume plant. "Tylosema esculentum" grows best in a sandy soil texture, instead of a clay loam soil texture, because a sandy soil has optimal physical properties that allow the Marama bean to germinate quickly.
Heterostyly and its evolutionary significance.
"Tylosema esculentum" is heterostylous, meaning that two or three morphological types of flowers exist in the population. For this specific legume, its pistil and anthers show reciprocal heights in two morphological types. Experiments involving in vivo fertilization (naturally occurring crosses of living organisms) and in vitro fertilization (crosses done in a laboratory setting) indicated that a two-allele self-incompatibility system exists in "Tylosema esculentum." Having a successful self-incompatibility system evolutionarily benefits this plant because it promotes more out-crossing and in turn creates more diversity within a population. Diversity in a population is important and beneficial because the population has a stronger defense against a lethal or harmful virus or bacteria infecting the entire population. The evolutionary significance of "Tylosema esculentum" is that the discovery of the function heterostylous plant was the first in the family Fabaceae.

ASD SEF Tempio Pausania

L'U.S. Tempio S.S.D. better known as Tempio is an Italian association football club located in Tempio Pausania, Sardinia. Its colours are sky blue.
currently playing Eccellenza.
History.
In 1946 the Gallura Tempio Physical Education Society was founded and registered in the Sardinian First Division, where it remained until 1952, when it was admitted to the new Promotion championship. After having played three good championships, Tempio finished 1st in the 1955-1956 season. This allowed access to the VI Series.After having consolidated itself permanently in the league and having changed its name twice (S.E.F. Tempio in 1958 and S.E.F. Tempio Pausania in 1962) the club finished 2nd in the league but lost the promotion play-off against Empoli; at the end of the season it changes its name again to U.S. Temple. In 1970 the team was relegated to Promotion and three years later it was relegated to the First Category. In 1977 and 1981 he obtained two promotions and returned to Serie D. In the 1986-1987 season Il Tempio won promotion to Serie C2, after winning its group. In this category he played thirteen Serie C2 championships (from 1987 to 2000). In the 2005-2006 season it won the Eccellenza Sardegna championship and was promoted to Serie D (a championship it had not played for three years), after which it obtained promotion to Serie C2 the following season, winning group B. In the 2006/2007 season the team was led by coach Ninni Corda. Although the objective was to have a calm championship without worries, in 2007 the team won the national Serie D championship, gaining promotion to Serie C2. In the final against Sangiuseppese held at the municipal stadium of Città Sant'Angelo (PE), the Sardinian team won with a clear 4-1 and thus also won the Serie D championship. In the semi-final they had eliminated Scafatese: 3-2 in Scafati and 2-0 at home. On 19 July 2007 Co.Vi.Soc. excludes the team from the Serie C2 championship. The company is thus forced to start again from a category lower than the Sardinian Excellence because the appeals presented to the CONI arbitration, the Lazio TAR and the Council of State also failed. On 27 August the FIGC Sardinia registered the club in the First Category. In September 2008 the bankruptcy of the Tempio Sports Union was decreed. A new company with the name initially of A.S.D. Polisportiva Limbara and subsequently A.S.D. S.E.F. Tempio Pausania (since November 2008) was admitted to Group D of the Sardinian First Category. Having won their group, the Galletti also performed well in the Promotion, attempting to attack the top regional championship for three years in a row but without managing to get there: first the dispute for the title with other fallen nobles such as Nuorese Calcio and Polisportiva Alghero, then penalties and vicissitudes with the sporting justice system seemed to destined the square to go no further. However, on August 10th, at the end of the 2011-12 season, the news arrived of the repechage for the S.E.F. Temple thanks to the withdrawal of Atletico Elmas and Tavolara. The Italian team will compete in the Eccellenza Sardinia championship for the 2012/2013 season, surviving the playouts. In the 2013/2014 season he will be relegated again to the Promozione, where he will play until the 2016/2017 season, a year which ended with the failure to register for the 2017/2018 Promozione championship and the consequent disappearance of the Tempio Pausania Physical Education Society from the island's football scene. On the occasion of the 2017/2018 season, a corporate team takes over the sporting title of SEF Tempio Pausania and founds the Unione Sportiva Tempio 1946. The team, however, will start again from the Second Category championship, the fourth regional level, at the end of which it will acquire the sporting title of Star Sport Olbia to access the First Category. At the beginning of the 2021/22 season, Tempio was taken over by the Sechi Group and after having applied for repechage, it was able to participate in the Promozionechampionship.[]

In 1991–92, his junior year, Shawnee was the New Jersey Group IV state champion, ranked #1 in New Jersey and #9 in the entire United States. In 1992–93 they were the South Jersey champion and was ranked #7 nationally. Earl was named the "USA Today" New Jersey Player of the Year in 1993 and his 2,006 career points total ranked him as first in scoring passing Darrin severs 1,996 points of Medford vo-tech Burlington County's all-time leading scorer at the time of his graduation.
College.
Earl accepted a scholarship to Penn State University where he was the starting point guard on the basketball team all four years. He is one of Penn State's all-time leaders in scoring and assists, and he was named to the All-Big Ten Conference second team by the media and third team by the coaches in 1996. He had an injury plagued college career that saw him redshirt twice and spend six years in the program. Earl led Penn State in assists four times. The 1995–96 Nittany Lions team started the season with a 19–2 record and was ranked #9 in the country at one point during the season.
Professional.
Dan Earl played professionally in Germany, Poland, and Portugal. He also spent time in the Continental Basketball Association as well as the NBA Development League. He got close to making a National Basketball Association team, where in the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons he spent time with the New Jersey Nets during their training camps.
Coaching career.
In 2006, Earl joined his "alma mater" as an assistant coach. He spent six seasons with the team until 2011, at which time he became the associate head coach at the United States Naval Academy.
In April 2015, Earl was hired as head coach at VMI, replacing Duggar Baucom.
On March 30, 2022, Earl accepted the head coaching position at Chattanooga, replacing Lamont Paris.
Finding immediate success in his first year, he achieved a 18-17 record, with solid wins coming against Murray State and Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders. Overachieving by reaching the Southern Conference Tournament Finals and losing to Furman Paladins.
Following an improve 2023-2024 Chattanooga season that saw them reach the second round of the Southern Conference Tournament and improve to 21-12, Coach Earl reloaded his roster and headed into 202-2025 Chattanooga season with high expectations.
On April 3, 2025, Earl capped a historic season at Chattanooga by going 29-9(tied for most in school history) and winning the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in overtime over Anteaters.
Personal.
Dan and his wife, Sheila, were married in the summer of 2008 and have two daughters, Mila and Alyssa. His brother Brian Earl is also an accomplished basketball player and is currently head coach at William &amp; Mary.

Cation channels of sperm

The cation channels of sperm also known as Catsper channels or CatSper, are ion channels that are related to the two-pore channels and distantly related to TRP channels. The four members of this family form voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that seem to be specific to sperm. As sperm encounter the more alkaline environment of the female reproductive tract, CatSper channels become activated by the altered ion concentration. These channels are required for proper fertilization. The study of these channels has been slow because they do not traffic to the cell membrane in many heterologous systems.
There are several factors that can activate the CatSper calcium channel, depending on species. In the human, the channel is activated by progesterone released by the oocyte. Progesterone binds to the protein ABHD2 which is present in the sperm plasma membrane, which causes ABHD2 to cleave an inhibitor of CatSper (2-arachidonoylglycerol) into arachidonic acid and glycerol. The human CatSper channel is pH-sensitive, and requires a high-pH environment. CatSper plays a key role in mediating hyperactive motility – prior to fertilization, sperm become entrapped within the fingerlike projections of the microvilli of the oviduct. In order for the sperm to fertilize the oocyte, CatSper must be present in order to initiate hyperactive motility, allowing the sperm to escape the microvilli and reach the oocyte for fertilization.
Certain substances act as agonist or inhibitor of CatSper (e. g. Pregnenolone sulfate is an agonist, pristimerin and lupeol are inhibitors).
Of the four members of the Catsper family, Catsper1 is found in the primary piece of sperm. Catsper1 plays an important role in evoked Ca2+ entry and regulation of hyperactivation in sperm. Catsper2 is localized in the sperm tail and is responsible for regulation of hyperactivation. Catsper3 and Catsper4 are found in both, the testes and sperm and play an important role in the motility of hyperactivated sperm. In humans, CatSper is distributed in quadrilateral nanodomains along the principal piece. Although Catsper seems to play an important role in sperm function, Catspers1-4 null mice have been found to have normal testicular histology, sperm counts and morphology, which is indicative of normal progression of spermatogenesis.

County Route 509 (New Jersey)

County Route 509 (CR 509) is a county highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The highway exists in two segments– one unsigned segment exists in northern Middlesex County while the signed mainline extends from North Avenue (Route 28) in Westfield to Straight Street (CR 504) in Paterson.
For two small stretches – in Clifton at the interchange with Route 19, and in Paterson as it crosses over the Passaic River – CR 509 splits into separate northbound and southbound alignments.
CR 509 intersects with the Garden State Parkway at Exit 138 in Kenilworth and again at Exit 148 in Bloomfield.
Route description.
The unsigned Middlesex County segment begins at the intersection of Park Avenue (CR 531) and Maple Avenue (CR 602) in South Plainfield. The county route, not signed as CR 509 but rather CR 602, heads northeast on Maple Avenue through a residential neighborhood. After crossing Woodland Avenue, the road enters Edison and passes between two parts of the Plainfield Country Club. CR 602 breaks off the road at Inman Avenue leaving CR 509 on Old Raritan Road continuing northeast on a locally maintained road. At the Union County line, the CR 509 designation ends and Raritan Road continues into Scotch Plains.
The signed mainline portion of CR 509 begins at a complex intersection in the town of Westfield, west of Elizabeth. State Route 28 (South Avenue) and Union County Route 610 (North Avenue) come from Scotch Plains to the west on either side of the train tracks running along New Jersey Transit's Raritan Valley Line and criss-cross at a traffic circle a few hundred feet from the Westfield Train Station. CR 509 (East Broad Street) branches off in a northeast direction from Route 28 just after the state highway branches off of the circle and crosses under the tracks before continuing east. From its southern terminus to Elmer Street in Westfield, the road is town maintained.
After cutting through downtown Westfield, CR 509 passes Fairview Cemetery on the right before coming to an intersection with CR 577 (Springfield Avenue), which splits off to the left before banking due north toward Mountainside, Springfield and U.S. Route 22 (US 22). CR 509 turns right onto Springfield Avenue but quickly becomes Kenilworth Boulevard. For less than a mile, the route passes through Cranford, during which time County Route 615 splits off to the right. It crosses into Kenilworth, where it is signed simply as "Boulevard" while traveling nearly due east. (East Broad Street continues straight as Nomahegan Drive for less than a mile before coming to a dead end).
Once through downtown Kenilworth, CR 509 interchanges the Garden State Parkway at Exit 138 before crossing into Union. It dips southeast for a few hundred feet, then turns left onto Salem Road at a five-point intersection with Union County routes 616 (Galloping Hill Road, bound for Roselle Park) and 619 (Chestnut Street, running between Linden and Irvington in Essex County).
Salem Road slowly bends back to the north, crossing State Route 82 near Kean University and over the Elizabeth River into Hillside, where it passes Vaux Hall Road and Hillside High School. CR 509 passes under US 22, but has no interchange. Traffic looking to access US 22 must turn right just beyond the overpass at Hillside Avenue, where access is provided near the Newark border. CR 509 turns left onto Hillside Avenue, while the road (now Liberty Road) continues to a dead end at St. Peter's Park on the outskirts of Newark.
After turning, CR 509 makes another quick turn, this time onto Chestnut Avenue. It passes over Interstate 78 (again with no interchange), to which access is available via Paine Avenue. The route continues as Coit Street, then Grove Street as it moves into Irvington and Essex County.
Now in a heavily populated neighborhood, CR 509 crosses Springfield Avenue a little east of the end of the State Route 124 designation, and crosses several 600-series routes while closely paralleling the Parkway. It intersects CR 510 (South Orange Avenue) at the massive Cemetery of the Holy Sepulchre, then moves into Newark for about half a mile, then enters East Orange where it meets CR 508 (Central Avenue). Shortly thereafter, it interchanges with Interstate 280, providing access to Newark, the Oranges and the Parkway.
CR 509 continues north into Bloomfield, where it turns left onto Franklin Street. It crosses back under the Garden State Parkway before moving into Passaic County, through the cities of Clifton and Paterson, where it ends at CR 504.
History.
The two segments of CR 509 were previously connected through southern Union County via Raritan Road, Martine Avenue, West Broad Street, and Route 28.
CR 509 Spur.
County Route 509 Spur was a county highway in Union County. The highway extended from Broad Street (CR 509) in Westfield to Route 124 in Springfield, via Old Raritan Road, Broad Street, Springfield Avenue, and Meisel Avenue. It passes through or by the Plainfield County Club, Ash Brook Golf Course, Ponderosa Farm Park, Midowaskin Park, Fairview Cemetery, Echo Lake Country Club, and Meisel Avenue Park
The road is now part of a southern extension of CR 577.

Secretariate of Briefs to Princes and of Latin Letters

The Secretariate of Briefs to Princes and of Latin Letters, or simply the Secretariate of Briefs, was one of the offices of the Roman Curia suppressed in 1967 during Pope Paul VI's reform of the Pontifical court. It was divided into two sections.
The Secretariate of Briefs to Princes consisted of the Secretary and two office assistants. The Secretary was a prelate responsible for writing the papal briefs addressed to emperors, kings, princes, and other dignitaries. He also prepared the allocutions that the Pope pronounced at consistories, as well as encyclicals and apostolic letters addressed to bishops and the faithful. He acted according to the instructions of the Pope. He was required to be a proficient Latinist because these documents were written in Latin. 
The Secretary for Latin Letters was also a prelate or private papal chamberlain ("cameriere segreto" in Italian) and was responsible for writing letters in Latin of lesser importance on behalf of the Pope. He had an office assistant.
The Latin Secretaries also played a significant part in the proceedings surrounding the death and election of the Pope; one of the two Secretaries usually pronounced the funeral oration, in Latin, for the deceased Pope, while another held an oration after the mass "Pro eligendo Pontifice" ('For the election of the Pope') at the beginning of the conclave. The last Secretaries to perform this task were Del Ton and Tondini in 1963.
In 1967, the office was suppressed as an independent department by the apostolic constitution "Regimini Ecclesiae universae"; its tasks were transferred to a new Latin Letters Office, subordinate to the Secretariat of State.

Diana Gould (writer)

Diana Gould (born October 11, 1944) is an American screenwriter and author who has worked in television for much of her career and published her first novel, "Coldwater", a noir thriller, in 2013.
Early life and education.
Diana Gould was born on October 11, 1944, in New York City. She attended the High School of Music &amp; Art, and graduated from UCLA in 1967 with a B.A. in Film. Gould wrote a screenplay in college that was made into the film "Jenny," which starred Marlo Thomas and Alan Alda. The script was rewritten by its director, George Bloomfield with Martin Lavut, and the finished product bore little resemblance to the film she had written. Gould only received credit for the story.
In 2004, she earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in fiction from the graduate writers program at Bennington College.
Career.
As a television writer and producer, her credits include pilots, episodes, movies and miniseries for network and cable.
Episodic television.
One of Gould’s first credits was as a writer on the TV series "Family" from 1977 to 1979. Following "Family", Gould was a writer and executive story consultant on the popular TV series "Knots Landing" (1980–1984) and producer and story writer on the equally popular show "Dynasty" (1985–86). She worked as a producer on the series "Kay O'Brien" in 1986–87.
"Berrenger's".
In 1985, Gould created the TV series "Berrenger's", where she was producer and writer. The series revolved around the Berrenger family that owned the successful department store which bore their name. The Berrenger family was a New York dynasty composed of glamorous characters who used money and power to further their goals in love and business.
Professional activities.
She served on the board of directors of the Writers Guild of America, West, and founded what became the Women’s Committee within that Guild. The Committee compiled the first statistical survey of the number of women writers working in network television. The survey found that in the 1973 season, only a tiny proportion of scripts were written by women. Shortly thereafter, women’s committees were formed in the Screen Actors Guild and the Directors Guild, which worked in concert to improve opportunities for women in film and television. For most of the 1990s, Gould was a member of the Hollywood Women's Political Committee.
Awards.
She received the Population Institute Award for a 1974 TV Movie, "I Love You... Goodbye", starring Hope Lange and Earl Holliman, produced by Tomorrow Entertainment for ABC. Her short story "The Monkey's Daughter" was nominated for the UCLA's Writing Program's James Kirkwood Literary Prize.
Book.
Gould's debut novel, "Coldwater", was published in April 2013 by Gibraltar Road/Vireo, an imprint of Rare Bird Books. "Coldwater" is a fast-paced Hollywood crime novel, with a flawed and heroic female protagonist.
Teaching and training.
Gould has taught fiction, screen and playwriting at Goddard College, and she continues to coach writers privately.
In 2012, she completed the Community Dharma Leader training program at Spirit Rock Meditation Center, and teaches at InsightLA, a meditation center in the Theravada Buddhist tradition in Los Angeles. She is the guiding teacher of Dharma Alliance, the LGBTQ group at InsightLA. Gould leads the Thursday night sitting group at InsightLA. She completed the Buddhist Chaplaincy Training program at the Sati Center in Redwood City, and works as a spiritual care volunteer with Vitas Hospice. In 2011, she won the "Volunteer of the Year" Award from Vitas.

<doc id="6959903" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6959903" title="Two-pore channel">
Two-pore channel

Two-pore channels (TPCs) are eukaryotic intracellular voltage-gated and ligand gated cation selective ion channels. There are two known paralogs in the human genome, TPC1s and TPC2s. In humans, TPC1s are sodium selective and TPC2s conduct sodium ions, calcium ions and possibly hydrogen ions. Plant TPC1s are non-selective channels. Expression of TPCs are found in both plant vacuoles and animal acidic organelles. These organelles consist of endosomes and lysosomes. TPCs are formed from two transmembrane non-equivalent tandem Shaker-like, pore-forming subunits, dimerized to form quasi-tetramers. Quasi-tetramers appear very similar to tetramers, but are not quite the same. Some key roles of TPCs include calcium dependent responses in muscle contraction(s), hormone secretion, fertilization, and differentiation. Disorders linked to TPCs include membrane trafficking, Parkinson's disease, Ebola, and fatty liver.
As implied by their name, TPC channels possess two pores and were named for their two Shaker-like repeats, which each have a pore domain. This contrasts with two-pore-domain potassium channels, which confusingly have only "one" pore and were named for the fact that each subunit has two P (pore) domains in its primary sequence.
History and discovery.
Although much is left to be discovered about TPC function, they have been extensively studied thus far. Many questions have been raised about the specific function of TPC channels, as well as the ions and molecules that appear to be most closely affiliated with these channels. Some of these ions are sodium, calcium, and NAADP. Present knowledge of TPCs has come from experiments done on mice and plants, especially "Arabidopsis thaliana". Additionally, because of the localization of these channels in mammals, it is difficult to use electrophysiological recordings on them. Therefore, these TPC channels have to be expressed in alternative compartments or organelles of the cell, such as plant vacuoles to be studied using the electrophysiological methods – especially the patch clamp technique. In order to clearly visualize the plant vacuoles, scientists have relied on fluorescent microscopy in their experiments. Using these techniques, scientists have been able to collect significant qualitative data in order to make conclusions about mammalian TPC functions. Specifically, scientists were able to conclude that human TPC are predominantly voltage-dependent sodium channels, and that PI(3,5)P2, an endolysosome-specific phosphoinositide (PIP), is a direct activator of TPC channels while NAADP is actually not an activator as it was once previously assumed to be.
Structure and domains.
At the mouth of the TPC pore, there are four amino acid residues with negative charges that can interact with ions that pass through. This site is too wide to select ions. Below the group of negative charges is the selectivity filter which is largely hydrophobic. There are two non-identical Shaker-like pore forming subunits. Subunit 1 consists of voltage sensing domain 1 (VSD1) and subunit 2 consists of the voltage sensing domain 2 (VSD2). The two subunit domains are separated by an EF-hand domain that has a calcium ion binding motif. This binding motif can facilitate channel activation by cytosolic calcium ions. Each of the two subunits are built from 12 transmembrane helices. The two central pore domains are combined from the voltage sensing domains, VSD1 and VSD2. Both the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) extend out on the cytosolic side, along with the EF-hand domain in the center that extends into the cytoplasm. The EF-hand domain extends into the cytosol, positioned between VSD1 and VSD2, where it can be activated by cytosolic calcium. The VSD2 domain is voltage sensitive active and can be inhibited by calcium in the lumen. This is a conformation change from the activation state to the inactive state. Two rings of hydrophobic residues seal the pore cavity from the cytoplasm; this results in forming the pore gate. Voltage sensors, selectivity filter, and the gate work together in a coordinated manner to open and close TPCs for regulation of ion conductance.
The VSD2 domain contains a normal voltage sensing motif, arginine residues R1, R2 and R3 and alpha helix S10, in respect to other voltage-gated ion channels structures, but this domain adopts a distinct conformation in the resting state of a voltage sensor. Luminal calcium acts as a TPC1 inhibitor, preventing ion conductance. There are two calcium binding sites for VSD2 on the luminal side. The first site does not affect the channel. Site 2, composed of residues in VSD2 and the pore domain, inhibits the channel by shifting the voltage dependence to more positive voltages.
Activation of TPCs is induced by a decrease in transmembrane potential, or by an increase in calcium concentrations in the cytosol. Low pH of the lumen and low calcium concentration could cause inhibition of these channels. TPCs are also phosphorylation-gated channels in both animals as well as plants. Sites of phosphorylation are at the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. These terminals are positioned to provide allosteric change in order to be activated by calcium from the cytosol.
Human and plant TPCs are multi-modal for conductance. The mechanism for channel opening is likely contributed to a combination of calcium concentrations, voltage, and phosphoregulation integration, in order to govern the conduction of ions through TPCs.
Biological roles (function/dysfunction).
Two-pore channels were analyzed by using cell biological methods, endolysosomal patch clamp techniques, and a variety of other methods to study their functions. From these, it was suggested that TPCs have some power in controlling the luminal pH in endolysosomal vesicles. When TPC2 expression is decreased or knocked out, there is a resultant elevation in production of melanin and thus melanosomal pH, and when TPC2 expression is increased, there is less production of melanin.
TPCs also are involved in nutrient detection as they become active constitutively on identifying the status of the nutrients. This is done by direct communication between the TPCs and mammalian/mechanistic targets of rapamycin (mTORs), which are associated with detecting levels of oxygen, nutrients, and energy in the cells and thus help with regulation of metabolism. This is how the TPCs play a role in this physiological regulation through this interaction.
TPCs regulate sodium and calcium ion conductance, intravasicular pH, and trafficking excitability. The second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) has been shown to mediate calcium release from these acidic organelles through TPCs. TPC2s are NAADP-gated calcium release channels where these TPC currents can be blocked by NAADP antagonists. TCP2 plays a critical role in the endocytosis allowing SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter cells.
Various ailments can occur from the knockdown of these channels, from metabolic and general infectious diseases to even cancer. The pathological conditions due to this lacking of TPCs are covered in the following sections.
Membrane trafficking.
TPCs play an integral role in membrane trafficking pathways. They are sectioned in endosomes and lysosomes, especially functioning in endo-lysosomal fusions. TPC trafficking activity has been noted to be conserved; but modifying TPCs affects transportation in the endocytotic pathway. The exact roles of TPCs are specific to cell type and context. These channels are permeable to calcium, making them function as Ca2+ ion channels. When stimulated by NAADP – a second messenger for TPCs –, calcium is released into the cytosol. The influx of calcium is what regulates the fusion between the endosome and lysosomes and what mediates trafficking events. When the function of TPCs are lost, substrates accumulate creating congestion. When the function of TPCs are increased, the lysosome becomes enlarged – which logically relates to increased fusion events with the endosome to lysosome.
Parkinson's disease.
One implication of membrane trafficking dysfunction leads to Parkinson's disease. Mutations to LRRK2 enzyme alter autophagy dependent upon NAADP and TPC2. The mutation increases the amount of Ca2+ flow through TPC2 by NAADP evoked signals. This increase in signaling leads to an increase in size of the lysosomes due to the increased rate and amount of fusion. The lysosome, therefore, is not able to break down components the way it should. This inability is associated with the onset of the disease. As TPC2 plays a vital role in this specific mechanism of Parkinson's disease development, it may potentially be a therapeutic target.
Ebola.
The Ebolavirus takes advantage of host cell endocytotic membrane trafficking, leaving TPCs as a potential drug target. Ebolavirus enter cells through micropinocytosis with endosomal vesicles. After entrance into the endosomal vesicle, Ebolavirus membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane to release the viral contents into the cytosol before the endosome can fuse with the lysosome. For the movement of the virus in endosomes, Ca2+ is necessary. As NAADP regulates maturation of endosomes by the calcium release through TPCs, normal functioning of TPCs allows the Ebolavirus to escape. Therefore, when TPCs are not functioning, the Ebolavirus cannot escape before the fusion of the endosome with the lysosome. In fact, when mice are treated with tetradine the infection is inhibited. This is because tetradine blocks TPC functioning of calcium release and thus, the Ebolaviruses is contained within the endosomal network destined to be degraded by the lysosome.
Fatty liver.
TPCs have been implicated in fatty liver diseases, such as NAFLD and NASH. As TPC2 is a cation channel for endocytotic membrane trafficking, TPCs contribute in trafficking LDL molecules for their breakdown and recycling. This primarily occurs within the liver. The degradation pathway causes LDL to end up in endosomes and lysosomes – where TPCs are located. The TPC mechanism once again allows the efflux of calcium for the fusion of the endosomes and lysosomes (where LDL is degraded). When TPCs are not present, or are not functioning properly, the degradation pathway results in defected trafficking. Without the fusion event LDL accumulates in liver cells. The loss of TPCs have been found to be a cause of the yellow coloration of liver, an expression of fatty liver which indicates liver damage.

Larry Taylor

Samuel Lawrence Taylor (June 26, 1942 – August 19, 2019) was an American bass guitarist, best known for his work as a member of the blues rock band Canned Heat. Before joining Canned Heat, he had been a session bassist for The Monkees and Jerry Lee Lewis. He was the younger brother of Mel Taylor, longtime drummer of The Ventures.
Early life.
Taylor was born in New York City. His mother was Jewish and his father was a "WASP" from Tennessee. Taylor was the younger brother to Mel Taylor (1933-1996), drummer for The Ventures. As a kid, Taylor's family moved back and forth from Brooklyn and Tennessee. They also lived in Texas and California. While living in California, Taylor was sent by his mother back to Tennessee to join a mandatory Reserve Officers' Training Corps to punish him and teach him discipline as he was an "incorrigilbe" child.
In an interview, Taylor said he only went to school for a year before dropping out:
His first exposure to music was through brother Mel, who was a bluegrass guitarist at the time as opposed to the surf rock drummer he was known for. Like his brother, Larry originally played guitar. He switched to bass guitar after seeing local California musician Wesley Reynolds at the Sea Witch club. Taylor would later run away from home with Reynolds, and drove in his car to Oklahoma.
Career.
1950s.
Taylor played bass guitar in The Gamblers, one of the first rock groups to play instrumental surf music. Its personnel also included Elliot Ingber, a future member of Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention, Fraternity of Man and Captain Beefheart's The Magic Band; Bruce Johnston, half of the Bruce and Terry duo with Terry Melcher from 1962–66 and longtime "sixth" member of The Beach Boys, for a time brother Mel Taylor, and guitarist-songwriter-bandleader Derry Weaver, who would record and perform in several capacities during the early 1960s. The Gamblers had a local hit in the Los Angeles area with "Moon Dawg" and Taylor played on the recording.
1960s.
Taylor played bass for Jerry Lee Lewis in 1961:
Taylor played bass on the majority of the albums produced by The Monkees including; "The Monkees" (1966), "More of the Monkees" (1967), "The Monkees Present" (1969), "Instant Replay" (1969), and Changes (1970). He would play bass on their hit Last Train to Clarksville.
Taylor was asked to join Canned Heat in 1967 after receiving a phone call from member Henry Vestine to join on bass. Taylor played with Canned Heat from 1967 to 1970, and appeared with them at various festivals including the Monterey International Pop Festival and Woodstock.
The bands manager, Skip Taylor, gave each member of the band a nickname connected to an animal. His band nickname was "The Mole." In addition to playing bass, he also played lead guitar on occasion. An example can be heard on the track "Down in the Gutter, But Free", on the album "Hallelujah".
1970s.
In 1970, when John Mayall moved to Los Angeles, Taylor and Mandel quit Canned Heat to join him in the Bluesbreakers. Taylor served the longest tenure as a member of the Bluesbreakers in the 1970s (1970–1977). After the Bluesbreakers tours in 1977, Taylor played briefly with the Sugarcane Harris Band (later called Pure Food and Drug Act).
In 1972, Larry joined his brother Mel's band to play on the Ventures album "Rock and Roll Forever". Canned Heat member Harvey "The Snake" Mandel also played on the album.
In 1974, Taylor became part of The Hollywood Fats Band led by Mike "Hollywood Fats" Mann. The pair joined Canned Heat for a King Biscuit Flower Hour concert in 1979. The bands history started around 1973/1974 when Hollywood Fats met Al Blake, Fred Kaplan, Jerry Smith and George "Harmonica" Smith, who were the touring members for Muddy Waters at the time. Fats was invited to be Water's sideman. Fats soon invited Taylor to replace Smith, and the band started touring as "The Hollywood Fats band". It was the first professional band Taylor played upright bass in. Taylor and Fats also returned to Canned Heat for two years (1978-1980). The Hollywood Fats band ended when Fats died tragically of a heart attack in 1986, aged 32.
When he left John Mayall in 1977, Taylor started studying playing upright bass. Taylor became a leading exponent and practitioner of the acoustic upright bass in the contemporary blues scene. He was quite prominently seen with his upright bass in the live blues film, "Lightning in a Bottle". He started playing upright bass with Rod Piazza, eventually cutting ties with him when Honey Piazza started getting involved as he thought that "she couldn't play" and "she was horrible".
1980s–2010s.
Taylor returned to Canned Heat again for five years in 1987. Taylor recorded "Reheated" in 1988, again with Canned Heat. He also briefly toured with them again from 1996 to 1997. 
In 2002, the surviving members of the Hollywood Fats band reformed. Not wanting to be a ghost band, they changed the name to "Hollywood Blue Flames". 
In 2010, Taylor and Harvey "The Snake" Mandel reunited with Adolfo "Fito" de la Parra and the rest of the current Canned Heat line-up to perform certain shows. Taylor, Mandel and de la Parra were all in the line-up that played Woodstock. The three members of Canned Heat's Woodstock line-up toured extensively from 2010 to 2014.
He was featured in a concert DVD released in winter 2013, from the album "Time Brings About A Change" by Floyd Dixon. This concert features three elder piano players – Dixon, Pinetop Perkins and Henry Gray — and was filmed at the Rhythm Room in Phoenix, Arizona on 1 and 2 June 2006.
Taylor played on numerous Tom Waits albums and was the bass player in his touring band. He appeared with Waits on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Tonight Show, Late Show with David Letterman (in 2012) and a show hosted by Jon Stewart. He played on ten of Waits' studio albums released between 1980 and 2011.
In 2014, Taylor was nominated for a Blues Music Award in the 'Best Instrumentalist – Bass' category.
Death.
Larry Taylor died at his home in Lake Balboa, Los Angeles on 19 August 2019 at the age of 77 after a 12-year long battle with cancer. He was survived by his wife Andrea and their three children.
Tom Waits remembered Taylor by writing on his website:

St. Peter's Cathedral (Charlottetown)

St. Peter's Cathedral, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada, was founded in 1869 as a result of the influence of the Oxford Movement. Since that time, the parish has remained Anglo-Catholic in ethos and practice.
General Information.
St. Peter's was designated a cathedral in 1879 by Bishop Hibbert Binney, the Bishop of Nova Scotia. Over the years, it has served as a second cathedral of the Anglican Diocese of Nova Scotia (now called Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island). The principal cathedral of the diocese is All Saints' Cathedral in Halifax. The diocese contains two civil provinces of Canada. 
St. Peter's Cathedral is located on Rochford Square, corner of All Souls' Lane and Rochford Street, Charlottetown.
Attached to the west side of the cathedral is All Souls' Chapel—designated as a National Historic Site in 1990. See All Souls' Chapel (Prince Edward Island).
History.
St. Peter's Cathedral parish was established in 1869. Work on the construction of the building began in 1867 and the first services were held on June 13, 1869. In December 1869, local artist Robert Harris (1849–1919) was commissioned to create scenes for the cathedral's first Christmas celebration.
As mentioned above, the founding of St. Peter's was directly linked to the Oxford Movement — a theological and liturgical revival of the Catholic tradition within Anglicanism, which was underway in parts of the Church of England at that time. The Oxford Movement had begun in England in the 1830s. In the 1850s, when some Charlottetown Anglicans from the Parish of Charlotte (St. Paul's) travelled abroad on business, they were inspired by the effects of this movement on the worship of England's churches. They returned to Prince Edward Island determined that these teachings and observances be practised in Charlottetown.
Anglican parishes on Prince Edward Island were under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of the Diocese of Nova Scotia. In the Rt. Revd Hibbert Binney, the travellers found a pastoral leader sympathetic to the Oxford Movement. Before long, he decided that a building then being planned as a "chapel-of-ease" of St. Paul's Church would become instead a cathedral under his own control.
The first services were held in June, 1869. Ten years later, on the Festival of St. Peter and St. Paul (June 29), the cathedral was consecrated. The cathedral building occupies the corner of All Souls' Lane and Rochford Street. It faces a park known as Rochford Square and is across the street from the Prince Edward Island Government offices.
Throughout its history, St. Peter's Cathedral has continued in the principles on which it was founded, as reflected in preaching, teaching, and worship.
Most of the cathedral incumbents or rectors have served for a significant period of time. The present rector is only the ninth since the parish was founded. The first priest-incumbent, the Revd George Hodgson (1869–1885), was succeeded by the Revd Canon James Simpson (1886–1920). He was followed by Canon Elwin Malone (1921–1952). Following Canon Malone, the Revd Canon Gerald Moffatt served as rector from 1952 to 1958. He was followed by Archdeacon J. R. Davies (1958–1967), Archdeacon G. S. Tanton (1967–1973), and the Revd Canon H. M. D. Westin (1974–1990). The most recently retired rector, the Revd Canon Peter Harris, came to the parish as curate in 1989 and was appointed rector in late Fall of 1990. Upon the retirement of Canon Harris on November 30, 2014, the Revd David Garrett was appointed rector.
St. Peter's Cathedral is well known to tourists and visitors because of the noted All Souls' Chapel, which is attached to the cathedral on the Rochford Street side. It was originally conceived as a memorial to the first priest-incumbent, Father Hodgson. The second incumbent, Canon James Simpson, along with two gifted parishioners, brothers William Critchlow Harris, an architect, and Robert Harris, an artist, envisaged what the future chapel would look like. William chose Island sandstone for the exterior and Robert adorned the interior with eighteen paintings depicting the Church Fathers, scenes from the New Testament and, over the altar, the majestic circular painting of the Ascending Christ. Skilled Island craftsmen succeeded in bringing to life the detail they envisaged. Work on the construction of the chapel began in 1888, and it was first opened for worship in November, 1889. In 1990, All Souls' Chapel was designated as a "National Historic Site". An exterior plaque in recognition of this designation was dedicated at a special ceremony in July 1994.
A new parish hall attached to the cathedral was erected in 2004, replacing an older hall that had stood on that site for over 100 years.
A full schedule of Sunday and weekday worship is maintained (Matins, Evensong, and the Holy Eucharist), and there are numerous parish organizations and activities.
All Souls' Chapel.
All Souls' Chapel was originally conceived as a memorial to Father George Hodgson, the first "priest-incumbent" of St. Peter's Cathedral, and was built in 1888 to plans prepared by William Critchlow Harris, ARCA (1854-1913), a member of the first class confirmed in St Peter's Church in 1869. The arched reredos, with statues of apostles and evangelists occupying the niches, is typical of Harris's altar screens. The Chapel walls are occupied by 16 paintings by William's brother, Robert Harris, CMG, PRCA (1849 - 1919). The round painting above the reredos is of Christ ascending to Heaven, and has been a treasured icon to generations of Cathedral parishioners. The Chapel was built by Lowe Brothers of Charlottetown, and the woodwork was carved by Messrs Whitlock and Doull. 
"The Sanctuary" is that part of the Chapel inside the great arch, and contains the "Altar", at which the Holy Mysteries of Christ's Body and Blood in the Eucharist have been celebrated daily since 1890. Set into the front of the Altar are "three roundels" painted by Robert Harris that show (a) Christ known of his companions "in the breaking of bread" at Emmaus on the Day of His Resurrection; (b) His Crucifixion; (c) Christ administering the Chalice to communicants. In the arched niches of the "Reredos" are statues of Christ (centre) flanked by St. John and St. James on His right and St. Peter on His left, with additional Apostles, including St. Paul, carrying the instruments used to put them to death.  To the right of the Altar is the "Credence Table", on which the Bread and Wine are placed before the Offertory. Set high in the side walls of the Sanctuary are portraits (left) of "St. Luke the Evangelist", by tradition an artist as well as a physician, a memorial to Robert Harris; and (right) "St. James the Just", a memorial to Canon James Simpson, who played an important part in planning the Chapel before his death in 1920. Every subject inside the Sanctuary is drawn from the New Testament Church.
"The Arch" is made from grey Wallace freestone, from the Nova Scotia side of the Northumberland Strait, and is richly carved with foliage and teardrops to symbolise both the Life Christ gives and the sorrows He suffered. The earliest churches built in Rome in the 4th century incorporated triumphal arches honoring Christ as King of kings and Lord of lords, and celebrating His victory over sin and death. William Harris always incorporated this feature in his church designs.
"The Nave: the Gospel side" is lined with portraits of early Church Fathers, as follows:
"St. Gregory the Great," shown with a blond Anglo-Saxon acolyte, illustrates a story told by the Venerable Bede. One day Gregory saw some fair-haired children for sale in the slave market in Rome. "What nation are they?" he asked. "They're Angles (English)," he was told. "Non Angli sed angeli (not Angles but angels)!" punned Gregory. He wished to evangelise the English; but when he was made Pope instead he sent 40 monks under St. Augustine of Canterbury to England in 597, and the Church of England was the result.
"St. John Chrysostom," Patriarch of Constantinople 398 - 407, was a celebrated preacher ("chrysostom" means "golden-tongued") and reformer who was deliberately killed by his enemies in the Byzantine court and Church by enforced travelling on foot in cold weather. Harris mistakenly shows him wearing the western-style "chasuble" and "alb" instead of an eastern "phelonion"
"St. Augustine of Hippo" (354 - 430) was one of the most influential theologians in Church history. Once, while writing his book on God titled "De Trinitate (On the Trinity)", he went for a stroll on the beach where he saw a small boy running back and forth with a bucket, pouring water from the shore into a hole he'd dug in the sand. "What are you doing?" asked Augustine. "I am pouring the sea into this hole," replied the boy. Augustine thought, "I'm no different - trying to get the great mystery of God inside my little head!" 
"St. Ambrose," Bishop of Milan 374 - 97, is shown refusing the Emperor Theodosius I entry to the basilica in Milan on Easter Day because he had massacred 7000 people in Thessalonica.
"St. Jerome" (342 - 420), settled in Bethlehem in 386, where he lived in a cave next to that in which Christ had been born, translating the Scriptures from Hebrew and Greek into Latin. He enjoyed controversies with heretics, kept a pet lion (to discourage interruptions?) and a skull to remind himself of his mortality. 
"St. Athanasius," Patriarch of Alexandria 328 - 373 became known as "Athanasius Contra Mundum (Against the World)" for his resolute support of orthodox Nicene Christianity in opposition to the Arian heresy which denied the divinity of Christ. For most of his life he was persecuted and often exiled; but his resolute character as well as his theology proved to be the outstanding obstacle to the triumph of Arianism, which faded away in the next century. 
"The Nave Windows:" the first two (the "Archangel St. Michael" and the "Blessed Virgin Mary &amp; Child") are by Kemp and are memorials to Frank Carvell and Margaret Mathilda Jane Hodgson respectively. Notice the crowned"M" and the serpent (symbol of evil) being trodden underfoot in both pictures, as well as other symbols drawn from the "Revelation of St. John the Divine". The third window, from the William Morris Studio, shows Christ as "Christus Rex", or "Christ the King", and is a memorial to a sister of Robert, William and Thomas Harris, Margaret Ellin Harris (1854 - 1944) and her husband, William Lawson Cotton, 1848 - 1928. It also has a serpent.
"The Entrance Wall" of All Souls' Chapel has three Robert Harris paintings which return to New Testament themes: 
"The Raising of Dorcas," a memorial to Dorcas Octavia Pedder Desbrisay, in illustration of the story told in Acts 9 of the raising of Dorcas by St. Peter.
"Christ Calling St. Andrew" to become "a fisher of men". The figure of Andrew is a portrait of Thomas Harris, Robert and William Harris's older brother, who died in 1904. The painting is in his memory.
"The Crucifixion of Christ," over the door, is in memory of William C. Harris, the Chapel's architect, and was the last painting to be installed in the Chapel. Appropriately, it is placed under a window showing Christ's Resurrection. The painting and the window placed over the door suggest that it is "through the grave and gate of death" that we pass to our joyful resurrection. Inside the door, in the small porch, is a statue of St. Peter holding the keys "to the Kingdom of Heaven" (see St. Matt. 16: 18-19).
Two terra cotta medallions, of "St. Peter" and "St. Paul", are set high in the entrance wall of the Chapel. Originally 14 such medallions were planned, but only these two were made. Eventually a set of "Stations of the Cross" was obtained, and 12 (of the 14) were set in the places prepared for the medallions. Fine imported encaustic tiles sheathe the upper reaches of the wall.
"The Epistle Side" also has three Robert Harris paintings, two showing persons only recently deceased when the paintings were made.
"The Morson Boys," two brothers who died within days of each other in 1899, are shown with other children with Christ in Paradise.
"The Martyrdom of St. Stephen," stoned to death in Jerusalem c.35 after preaching a sermon his hearers disliked ("Acts 6"), occupies the space over the doors to the sacristy. Two of the doors accommodate Latin memorials to the "Reverend George Hodgson" and "Canon James Simpson", the Cathedral's first "Incumbents" (so styled rather than "Dean" because St. Peter's was not given a "Chapter" when it was made the Anglican Cathedral for Prince Edward Island in 1879). A third door panel commemorates "Robert" and "William Harris."
"The Harris Family", a group portrait, shows members of the family who died before 1914 (with the exception of Thomas, who is portrayed elsewhere) as a Holy Land family being blessed by Christ. In the centre sits mother, Sarah Stretch Harris (1818 - 1897) with Tom's son Clare Harris (1880 - 1892) standing alongside her, and his sister, Dora Harris (1892 - 1911), sitting in front. To the left of Clare is Martha ("Little Patty") Harris (1856 - 1864), a sibling of Thomas, Robert, William and Margaret Ellin. Leaning over Sarah is William Critchlow Harris junior (1854 - 1913), the Chapel's architect, and sitting back in the shadows is the family patriarch, William Critchlow Harris senior (1813 - 1899), who brought his family to Charlottetown from Liverpool, England, on the barque "Isabel" in 1856. Each of the trees in nearby Rochford Square, planted in 1884, represents a Harris family member.
Over the years many memorials have been placed in All Souls' Chapel. The "pews" commemorate Mrs. George Hodgson, who died in 1934, and accommodate the living worshippers who, surrounded by the apostles and saints of old, and the faithful departed, complete the scheme of "All Souls" under the Lordship of Christ in the altar painting. Most of the "plates" commemorate deceased members of the Cathedral congregation, some of them familiar names from the civic and social life of Charlottetown in days gone by. One carries a portrait of Ruth Harris (1893 - 1984), a niece of Robert Harris, daughter of his youngest brother Ned, made from Robert's charcoal sketch of her when she was 24.
The "kneelers", made by women of the Cathedral congregation, show the "phoenix", a mythical bird supposed to have come back to life after perishing by fire - a symbol of the Resurrection.        
On the organ a "Book of Remembrance" contains names of deceased members of the Cathedral congregation. 
"The Sanctuary Lamp" carries a "white light", symbolic of Christ's Real Presence in the Blessed Sacrament, and showing that it is reserved nearby. Anglican Church teaching affirms Christ's Real Presence in the Sacrament while rejecting Transubstantiation as an explanation of the manner of it. 
"Morning Prayer" and "Evening Prayer" are said daily in the Chapel, and the "Holy Eucharist" is celebrated Tuesdays at 7:30 a.m. and other weekdays (except Mondays) at 10 a.m. If Monday is a Holy Day, Evening Prayer is followed by a celebration of the Holy Communion. Morning Prayer is said 15 minutes before the Eucharist. This daily round of worship and prayer is part of the "liturgy" or work of the Cathedral. The Chapel is open every day for "personal prayer" and "meditation".
The Canadian "Book of Common Prayer" and "The English Hymnal" are used in the chapel.

Happening bar

A or is a Japanese sex club. In both, prospective customers pass an initial vetting to become members, then pay an entrance fee to enter the club. The club will provide drinks at a bar (often for free), rooms for sex and typically shower facilities. Entrance to couple kissa is limited to male-female couples and single women, while a happening bar will also allow single men to enter, although typically at a steep surcharge (as much as ¥25,000, whereas a woman might enter for free). Entry is denied to the underaged (under 20), male groups, drunk or intoxicated people and, in some establishments, foreigners.
Happening bars and couple kissas skirt Japanese prostitution laws by neither providing nor promising actual sex on premises, instead stressing that what may or may not happen is entirely up to customers. In a high-profile incident in 2004, after porn star and wrestler Chocoball Mukai advertised on his website that he would be performing, the happening bar "Rock" in Tokyo's Roppongi district was raided by police. Chocoball, who had been caught in the act with another porn star, was later convicted for public indecency and sentenced to a five-month jail term, and the club was forced to shut down.

Rebuild of Evangelion

Rebuild of Evangelion, known in Japan and on Amazon Prime Video as , is a Japanese animated film series and a reboot of the original "Neon Genesis Evangelion" anime television series, produced by Studio Khara. Hideaki Anno serves as the writer and general manager of the series, with Kazuya Tsurumaki, Masayuki, Mahiro Maeda and Katsuichi Nakayama directing the films. Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Ikuto Yamashita and Shirō Sagisu returned from the series to provide character designs, mechanical designs and music respectively.
The films utilize digital ink and paint, some computer-generated imagery, and provide new scenes, settings and characters, with a completely original story in the third film, and an entirely new conclusion in the fourth. A stated intention of the series is for it to be more accessible to non-fans than the original anime series and films were.
Storyline.
"Rebuild of Evangelion" was originally presented as an alternate retelling of the original "Neon Genesis Evangelion" anime series: the first three movies were intended to be an "alternate retelling" of the series.
List of films.
The concept of , which roughly corresponds to "beginning", "middle", and "end", originated in classical gagaku music and is best known to describe the acts of a noh play. In lieu of the traditional classification, the production team has chosen to represent with the Roman letter Q, for "quickening." With the premiere of the third film, it was announced that the symbol to be used for the final film would be the musical symbol known as the final barline (𝄂 or ||). However, according to an article published by Anime News Network, it is actually the end repeat sign (𝄇 or :||). The intended Japanese pronunciation of this symbol has not been stated.
The film titles, in contrast to the normal katakana spelling of , replace the and characters with the obsolete character and the infrequently used katakana , respectively. The change is purely a stylistic one, as there is no change in pronunciation and all appearances of the Latin spelling of "Evangelion" remain the same. The final film reverts to the original katakana spelling, but adds to the title; as it is written in katakana and not kanji, the meaning of "shin" is ambiguous and it can be alternatively translated as either (as in previous "Rebuild" films), , or even something else entirely. As was done with episode titles in the original series, each film has an original Japanese title and a separate English international title picked out by the Japanese studio itself.
Production.
Hideaki Anno had originally intended on making a new "Evangelion" story since 2000. The "Rebuild" films were meant as a way to open up the franchise in the future to new creators and turn Eva into a "new "Gundam"", likening this initiative to "G Gundam", as well as Anno's overall intentions to revitalize what he saw as a stagnant anime industry and acquire funds and experience for future projects. Anno initially began work on what would eventually become the "Rebuild" films in the fall of 2002, spending nearly six months on pre-production before being delayed by various other projects (such as "Cutie Honey", the "" OVA, and even a few movie roles). This included watching the entire original series back-to-back. Originally, he would call it "G Evangelion" or simply ""Evangelion 2"," and have it be directed by a new creator. However, Anno was unable to find a candidate, as most other directors felt too intimidated by the task of making a new "Evangelion." By 2005, Anno settled on making the films himself. At first, Anno wanted to simply remake the original anime series as a more modern film, significantly altering only the ending.
Assistant Director Kazuya Tsurumaki claimed the original intention was that "the first 80%" of the "Rebuild" series would be a "compilation" of the original anime series, and the changes would only start with the last film, in keeping with earlier comments in 2006 by producer Toshimichi Ohtsuki regarding the intention that only the ending would be a major departure from the series, as staff felt "End of Evangelion" could not receive a sequel, and the "Rebuild" movies were not going to be "metaphysical" like the original anime, but rather "oriented towards entertainment". In 2006, Anno also stated in an interview that "2.0" and "3.0". a two-parter including a new-finale akin to "End of Evangelion," would both be released by 2008. Again he revealed his "Gundam" inspiration, specifically from "Zeta Gundam New Translation", which had itself received a compilation/remake at around the same time.
Those plans eventually changed, and major changes started happening as early as "," particularly with the introduction of Mari Illustrious Makinami, who, thanks to fan expectations, grew from a minor character limited to a single scene to one of the protagonists. The production of "" was personally very demanding for Anno and led him into a bout of depression, delaying production for the final film as Anno worked on other projects such as "The Wind Rises" and "Shin Godzilla".
The studio involved with production of the original series, Gainax was facing significant problems at the time, and Anno felt unable to continue his project there. In order to produce the films, Anno left Gainax and founded Khara in May 2006 together with most of the talent involved in the original anime series. In the December 2006 issue of "Newtype", Anno revealed he was happy to finally recreate Eva "as he wanted it to be" in the beginning and that he was no longer constrained by technological and budget limitations.
The release schedule of the "Rebuild" films has experienced many delays, with the first film pushed from its original summer release date to fall 2007, and the second film's release date shifted from 2008 to summer 2009. The third film, initially announced as a simultaneous release with "Evangelion: Final" in the summer of 2008, was released in fall 2012.
In 2012, the final film was briefly listed on Khara's website for a 2013 release. Later, in the August 2013 issue of "OtonaFami", it was announced that it would be released around winter 2015. In October 2014, Anno announced that due to other commitments, which was later revealed to be his involvement with "Shin Godzilla", the film will be further delayed to an unknown date despite the previous release date being echoed in the January 2015 issue of "Weekly Bunshun". In 2019 the final film, now called "", was scheduled for a June 27, 2020 release date but received two delays due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released on March 8, 2021. "3.0+1.0" is intended to be Anno's final "Evangelion" work. 
To encourage staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, the three released movies have been made available to watch for free at the official EVA-EXTRA app, and for a limited time, at the official YouTube channel of Studio Khara.
In contrast with the television series, Matisse Pro EB font was used for Japanese and English texts, with Neue Helvetica, Futura, Eurostile also used for English texts. On 10 November 2016, Fontworks began selling the Matisse EB TrueType edition family, which includes the television series and "Rebuild of Evangelion" versions of the font.
An updated version of the film, titled "Evangelion: 3.0+1.01 Thrice Upon a Time", was released in Japanese theaters on June 12, 2021. This version features updated cuts of various scenes while not changing the overall story of the film. "3.0+1.0" had a home media release on March 8, 2023. In addition to several bonus material and another update titled "Evangelion: 3.0+1.11 Thrice Upon a Time", it also featured two bonus videos: "Evangelion: 3.0 (-120min)," which was originally released as a 17-page manga in a theatrical re-release of "3.0+1.0", while "Evangelion: 3.0 (-46h)" was an original video animation bundled with the home media release of the film, which also featured "-120min" re-released in video format with full voiceover by the original cast. Both take place in the time-skip between "2.0" and the "3.0."
Legacy.
Collaborative project.
In February 2022, Studio Khara, Toei Company, Toho Company, and Tsuburaya Productions announced a collaborative project titled "Shin Japan Heroes Universe" for merchandise, special events and tie-ins. The project united properties that Hideaki Anno had worked on bearing the title "Shin" including "Shin Godzilla", "Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time", "Shin Ultraman" and "Shin Kamen Rider".

Appalachian Trail by state

The Appalachian National Scenic Trail spans 14 U.S. states over its roughly : Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. The southern end is at Springer Mountain, Georgia, and it follows the ridgeline of the Appalachian Mountains, crossing many of its highest peaks and running almost continuously through wilderness before reaching the northern end at Mount Katahdin, Maine.
The trail is currently protected along more than 99 percent of its course by federal or state land ownership or right-of-way. Annually, more than 4,000 volunteers contribute over 175,000 hours to maintain the trail, an effort coordinated largely by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC), assisted by some thirty trail clubs and multiple partnerships.
Georgia.
Counties crossed: Fannin County → Union County → Lumpkin County → White County → Towns County → Habersham County → Rabun County
Georgia has of the trail, including the southern terminus at Springer Mountain (elevation ). An approach trail (not part of the AT) begins at the Amicalola Falls State Park visitor center. At , Blood Mountain is the highest point on the trail in Georgia. The AT and approach trail are managed and maintained by the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club.
North Carolina.
Counties crossed: Clay County → Macon County → Swain County → Graham County → Swain County → (The following counties are traversed along the Tennessee border) Haywood County → Madison County → Yancey County → Mitchell County → Avery County
North Carolina has of the trail, not including more than along the Tennessee border. Altitude ranges from .
The trail crosses Bly Gap one-tenth of a mile north of the Georgia state line. The trail further north includes peaks such as Standing Indian Mountain, Mount Albert, and Wayah Bald, followed by a Nantahala Gorge crossing by Wesser Falls and at Nantahala Outdoor Center, and, at the section's north end, is the Fontana Dam Shelter, affectionately known as the Fontana Hilton, known for its view of fjordlike Fontana Lake, comparatively spacious accommodations, water spigots, flush toilets, nearby free hot showers, and a three dollar shuttle into Fontana Dam, North Carolina.
Tennessee.
Counties crossed: Blount County → Sevier County → Cocke County → Greene County → Unicoi County → Carter County (where it leaves the North Carolina border) → Johnson County → Sullivan County
Tennessee has of the trail, including more than along or near the North Carolina border. The section that runs just below the summit of Kuwohi (formerly Clingmans Dome) in Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the highest point on the trail at . The trail enters Tennessee from North Carolina atop Doe Knob and exits Tennessee into Virginia atop Holston Mountain.
The first of the A.T. in Tennessee follow the crest of the Smokies, and are largely shared with North Carolina. In the western Smokies, the trail traverses a young forest that replaced what was once a large highland pasture, most noticeable in areas such as Spence Field, Thunderhead Mountain, and Silers Bald. The trail reaches for the first time on the western slope of Mount Buckley (a sub-peak of Kuwohi), where it first enters the sub-alpine spruce-fir forest, and comes within a few meters of the summit of Kuwohi. The trail crosses U.S. Route 441 at Newfound Gap and traverses a series of rocky cliffs known as "The Sawteeth" en route to the high ridges of the Eastern Smokies. Here, the trail crosses Mount Chapman and Mount Guyot, and passes one of its most remote shelters at Tricorner Knob before gradually descending.
Just beyond Mount Cammerer, the A.T. exits the Smokies, crossing Interstate 40 into the Cherokee National Forest. After traversing Snowbird Mountain, Max Patch Bald, and Lemon Gap (just south of Del Rio), the trail exits Tennessee atop Bluff Mountain and re-enters again atop Rich Mountain (in Greene County), some to the northeast.
After traversing the Bald Mountains, the Appalachian Trail crosses the Nolichucky River and enters the Unakas, gradually ascending to the Roan Highlands near the town of Roan Mountain in Carter County. Atop Roan High Knob, the A.T. again eclipses 6,000 feet (approximately ), and passes the highest shelter along the entire trail. After crossing Grassy Ridge, which is the longest stretch of grassy bald in the Appalachians, the trail descends to the Laurel Fork Valley, where it turns west away from the state boundary.
Just beyond White Rocks Mountain, the trail passes through Hampton, Tennessee, before turning north again. At Watauga Lake at the TVA Watauga Dam, the trail turns northeast, crossing Iron Mountain before turning briefly to the northwest at the Carter County-Johnson County line. After passing over Cross Mountain, the trail again turns northeast and ascends Holston Mountain en route to Virginia.
Virginia.
Counties crossed: Washington County → Smyth County → Grayson County → Wythe County → Bland County → Tazewell County → Giles County Briefly joins the West Virginia border here → Craig County → Montgomery County → Roanoke County → Botetourt County → Bedford County → Rockbridge County → Amherst County → Nelson County → Augusta County → Albemarle County → Rockingham County → Greene County → Page County → Rappahannock County→ Warren County → Fauquier County → Clarke County → (rejoins the West Virginia Border here) Loudoun County
Virginia has the most mileage of the trail of any state with of the trail (one-fourth of the entire trail), including more than along the West Virginia border. With the climate, and the timing of northbound thru-hikers, this section is wet and challenging because of the spring thaw and heavy spring rainfall.
Substantial portions of the trail closely parallel Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park and, further south, the Blue Ridge Parkway. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy considers to be excellent for beginning hikers a well-maintained section of the trail that the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed in Shenandoah National Park and whose climbs rarely exceed .
McAfee Knob is affectionately known as "the most photographed spot on the A.T.". McAfee Knob is part of what is known as Virginia's Triple Crown. The three iconic peaks that make up the Triple Crown are McAfee Knob, Dragon's Tooth, and Tinker Cliffs. These three peaks are located near Roanoke, VA. Hikes to each of the overlooks can be completed individually as day hikes or in one trip as an approximately 35 mile backpacking trip.
The plant life on Virginia's section of the trail includes thickly-growing wild blueberry bushes. The bushes are especially numerous along the trail's central sections, through the Shenandoah National Park, and its northern sections. The blueberries ripen in late summer, offering hikers a plentifully available food source.
In 1989, Hurricane Hugo damaged over 300 miles of the Appalachian Trail in Virginia. Three weeks of rain uprooted thousands of trees in what Mike Dawson of the Appalachian Trail Conference called "the worst break in the continuous footpath since it was declared open from Maine to Georgia in August 1937." Due to responsive and prepared local trail clubs, all but six miles of the trails were re-opened within a month.
The annual "Trail Days" festival held in Damascus has become the largest single gathering of Appalachian Trail hikers anywhere.
West Virginia.
Counties crossed: Monroe County (while sharing the trail with Virginia in the south → Jefferson County (while sharing the trail and briefly entering the state.)
West Virginia has of the trail, not including about along the Virginia border. The trail passes through the town of Harpers Ferry, headquarters of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Harpers Ferry is considered the "psychological midpoint" of the AT, although the actual midpoint is just west of Pine Grove Furnace State Park in Pennsylvania.
Maryland.
Counties crossed: Washington County → Frederick County
Maryland has of the trail, ranging in elevation from . Most of the trail runs along the ridge line of South Mountain in South Mountain State Park Hikers are required to stay at designated shelters and campsites, no camping off-trail. Some hikers choose to hike Maryland in a single day, usually starting just before dawn and ending at dusk. This is known as the Maryland Challenge. The Challenge is especially popular among thru-hikers due to the endurance built up by the time one reaches Maryland from either terminus. A variation of this challenge, known as the Four State Challenge, involves hiking between the ridge line straddling Virginia and West Virginia all the way to or from Pennsylvania in 24 hours, thus hiking in four states in one day. The Four State Challenge requires a hike of approximately , most of which are in Maryland.
The state contains the Ensign Cowell shelter, and the Rocky Run Shelters near Boonsboro. The older log structure was built by the CCC in 1940.
Another stop is the Dahlgren Campground. Hikers can stop here for the night and have free showers. The trail passes close to the eastern edge of Greenbrier State Park. The trail also goes through Pen Mar Park, which is just north of High Rock, which offers views and is a hang-gliding site.
On March 15, 2015, a hiker was killed near the Ed Garvey shelter in the southern part of the state's portion of the trail when a large tree fell on him.
Pennsylvania.
Counties crossed: Franklin County → Cumberland County → Perry County → Dauphin County → Lebanon County → Schuylkill County → Berks County → Lehigh County → Carbon County → Northampton County → Monroe County
Pennsylvania has of the trail, extending from the Pennsylvania-Maryland border at Pen Mar, a tiny town straddling the state line, to the Delaware Water Gap, at the Pennsylvania-New Jersey line. The Susquehanna River is generally considered the dividing line between the northern and southern sections of the Pennsylvania AT. The AT crosses the Susquehanna via the Clarks Ferry Bridge, near Duncannon.
In the southern half of the state, the AT passes through Caledonia State Park, Michaux State Forest, and Pine Grove Furnace State Park. In 1935, the midpoint of the AT was at Center Point Knob. It is currently in PGF State Park and marked by a "Midpoint" sign. These areas in south central Pennsylvania are the northernmost portions of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are geologically distinct from the Ridge and Valley section further north. The two parts are separated by the broad Cumberland Valley, where the trail has a change of scenery, crossing many farms and large highways. There is no camping allowed in the stretch between Alec Kennedy and Darlington shelters.
In the northern half of the state, the AT climbs back up into the mountains and passes through St. Anthony's Wilderness, which is the second largest roadless area in Pennsylvania and home to several coal mining ghost towns, such as Yellow Springs and Rausch Gap. Trail towns that are common stops with thru-hikers are Boiling Springs, Duncannon, Port Clinton, Palmerton, Wind Gap, and Delaware Water Gap. Northeast of the Schuylkill River, the trail runs along the top of the Blue Mountain ridge. Just before entering New Jersey, the Blue Mountain ridge becomes the Kittatinny Ridge.
With the description of "where boots go to die", Pennsylvania is infamous among thru-hikers for having more long stretches of rocky trail than any other state, although many feel the rocks are overrated. The worst rocks are in the northern half of the state, north of the Susquehanna River. Many consider Pennsylvania one of the easier parts of the AT, since it is mostly walking on ridges with relatively small elevation changes compared to many other states.
New Jersey.
Counties crossed: Warren County → Sussex County → Passaic County
New Jersey has of the trail. This makes the New Jersey section of the Appalachian Trail the second longest trail in the state, behind the Delaware and Raritan Canal Trail. More than half of the Appalachian Trail is along the top of Kittatinny Ridge at the northwestern corner of the state. The trail enters New Jersey from the south on a pedestrian walkway along the Interstate 80 Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge over the Delaware River, ascends from the Delaware Water Gap to the top of Kittatinny Ridge in Worthington State Forest, passes Sunfish Pond, continues north through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and Stokes State Forest, and eventually reaches High Point State Park, highest peak in New Jersey (a side trail is required to reach the actual peak). It then turns in a southeastern direction along the New York-New Jersey border for about , passing over long sections of boardwalk bridges over marshy land, then entering Wawayanda State Park and then the Abram S. Hewitt State Forest just before entering New York near Greenwood Lake. The Appalachian Trail in New Jersey is maintained and updated by the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference.
Black bear activity along the trail in New Jersey increased rapidly starting in 2001. In July 2005, a teenage hiker sleeping at Mashipacong Shelter was awakened by a bear biting his leg. The bear was later identified and killed by authorities. Metal bear-proof trash boxes are in place at all New Jersey shelters.
New York.
Counties crossed: Orange County → Rockland County → Westchester County → Putnam County → Dutchess County
New York's of trail contain very little elevation change compared to other states. It is rather rugged terrain nonetheless, with many short though nearly-vertical ledges and small cliffs. From south to north, the trail summits many small mountains under in elevation, its highest point in New York being Prospect Rock at , and less than half a mile (800 m) from the border with New Jersey. The trail continues north, climbing near Fitzgerald Falls, passing through Sterling Forest State Park, and then entering Harriman State Park and Bear Mountain State Park. In Harriman State Park, the trail passes through the famous Lemon Squeezer, a narrow crack between huge boulders. At Bear Mountain State Park, it goes through the park zoo, where the lowest point on the entire AT, at above sea level, is located in front of the bear cage. Immediately afterward it crosses the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge, then climbs into Hudson Highlands State Park where it follows a ridge over several low-elevation peaks. It then passes through Fahnestock State Park and continues northeast and crosses the Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line at Pawling, which is also the only train station along the length of the trail. It enters Connecticut via the Pawling Nature Reserve. The section of the trail that passes through Harriman and Bear Mountain State Parks is the oldest section of the trail, completed in 1923. The Appalachian Trail in New York is maintained and updated by the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference.
Professional trail builder Eddie Walsh and Edward Goodell (executive director of the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference) oversaw and coordinated the construction of a paved trail coming off Bear Mountain. That portion of the trail is composed of 800 steps made of slabs of granite followed by over a mile of walkway supported by stone crib walls with boulders called gargoyles lining the path. The project took four years, cost roughly $1 million, and was executed by about 700 volunteers. It officially opened in June 2010.
Connecticut.
Counties crossed: Litchfield County
The of trail in Connecticut lie almost entirely along the ridges to the west above the Housatonic River Valley. The trail climbs ridges above the town of Kent, and then works its way past the Housatonic River to Falls Village, where it regains the heights. After the town of Salisbury, the trail ascends into the Taconic Range, crossing, in order: Lions Head, Riga Ridge, and Bear Mountain, after which the Massachusetts line is achieved at Sage's Ravine.
The trail passes within one mile (1.6 km) of the business district of Kent, a resupply point for long-distance hikers. In the town of Salisbury (which occupies the northwestern corner of the state), it skirts the town center before reaching the summit of Bear Mountain, the highest peak in Connecticut at , descending, and entering Massachusetts. (The state's true highest point, on the shoulder of Mount Frissell at the Massachusetts line, lies about west of the AT, just east of the junction of those two states with New York. Such a side-trip is on the order of long and entails about 1,300 vertical feet (400 m) of climbing.)
Massachusetts.
County crossed: Berkshire County
Massachusetts has of trail. The entire section of trail is in western Massachusetts' Berkshire County; it traverses both the Taconic Mountains and the Berkshires. The A.T. climbs the highest peak in the southern Taconic Mountains, Mount Everett (), then descends to the Housatonic River Valley and skirts the towns of Egremont, Sheffield, and of Great Barrington. From there, it ascends into the Berkshires and passes through the towns of Tyringham, Dalton and Cheshire. It ascends into the Taconic Mountains again, visiting Mount Greylock, the highest point in the state at . It then quickly descends to the valley of the Hoosic River within of North Adams and Williamstown, before ascending again to the Vermont state line. The trail throughout Massachusetts is maintained by the Berkshire Chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club.
Vermont.
Counties crossed: Bennington County → Windham County → Rutland County → Windsor County
Vermont has of the trail. Upon entering Vermont, the trail coincides with the southernmost sections of the generally north–south-oriented Long Trail (which is subject to a request by its maintainers to protect it in its most vulnerable part of the year by forgoing spring hiking). It follows the ridge of the southern Green Mountains, summiting such notable peaks as Stratton Mountain, Glastenbury Mountain and Killington Peak. The trail traverses the Glastenbury, Lye Brook, and Peru Peak Wilderness areas of the Green Mountain National Forest. At Maine Junction, the AT reaches an intersection with the eastern end of the North Country National Scenic Trail, with that trail and the next segment of the Long Trail departing to the north. The AT then turns in a more eastward direction, crossing the White River, passing through Norwich, and entering Hanover, New Hampshire, as it crosses the Connecticut River. The Green Mountain Club maintains the entire portion of the AT in Vermont.
The NPS challenged Killington and Pico ski resorts in Vermont over development of private land that crossed the AT.
New Hampshire.
Counties crossed: Grafton County → Carroll County → Coos County
New Hampshire has of the trail. The New Hampshire AT is nearly all within the White Mountain National Forest. The easier southern portion of the trail, from Hanover to Glencliff, passes over Velvet Rocks, Moose Mountain, Smarts Mountain, and Mount Cube. It then ascends Mount Moosilauke and enters the high peaks region of the White Mountains. For northbound thru-hikers, it is the beginning of the main challenges that go beyond enduring distance and time: in New Hampshire and Maine, rough or steep ground are more frequent, and alpine conditions are found near summits and along ridges.
In the Presidential Range of the White Mountains, the trail runs completely above treeline from the summit of Mount Pierce to the north side of the cone of Mount Madison, a distance of about . The AT passes over the summits of 15 of the 48 four-thousand footers of New Hampshire: Moosilauke, South and North Kinsman, Lincoln, Lafayette, South Twin, Jackson, Pierce, Washington (the highest point of the AT north of Tennessee), Madison, Wildcats D and A, Carter Dome, South and Middle Carter. It comes close to the summits of 9 other of the 48 four-thousand footers: Liberty, Garfield (60 yards away over ledges), Galehead, Zealand, Eisenhower, Monroe, Jefferson, Adams, and Moriah. A series of comfortable huts are maintained along parts of the NH trail by the Appalachian Mountain Club. In New Hampshire, the Dartmouth Outing Club maintains the AT from the Vermont border to Mount Moosilauke, Randolph Mountain Club maintains 2.2 miles from Osgood Trail near Madison Hut to Edmands Col, with the AMC maintaining the remaining miles through the state. The trail passes through the town of Hanover and near the town of Gorham, which have grocery stores and are accessible by public transportation (Dartmouth Coach and Concord Coach Lines) from Boston. Concord Coach also has bus service to Lincoln (several miles off the AT) and AMC Pinkham Notch. During the summer season, AMC runs a shuttle service to Crawford Notch and Franconia Notch.
A tradition of thru-hikers Mooning the Cog has developed on Mount Washington.
Maine.
Counties crossed: Oxford County → Franklin County → Somerset County → Piscataquis County
The Appalachian Trail Conservancy (or ATC) believes the of the trail in Maine are particularly difficult. The western section includes a mile-long (1.6 km) stretch of boulders at Mahoosuc Notch, often called the trail's hardest mile. The central Maine section crosses the Kennebec River at a point where it is wide, the widest unbridged stream along the trail. The last and most isolated portion in the state (and arguably on the entire trail) is known as the "Hundred-Mile Wilderness". This section heads east-northeast from the town of Monson and ends outside Baxter State Park just south of Abol Bridge. More moose are seen by hikers in this state than any other on the trail. The northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail is on Katahdin's Baxter Peak in Baxter State Park.
Baxter State Park closes the summer rules overnight camping season from October 15 to May 15 each year. Park management strongly discourages thru-hiking within the park before May 31 or after October 15. The AMC maintains the AT from the New Hampshire border to Grafton Notch, with the Maine Appalachian Trail Club responsible for maintaining the remaining miles to Katahdin.
The trail runs near Saddleback Mountain resort. Starting in the 1980s there have been frequent discussions about the ski area's development on or near the AT, most recently over the construction of a solar farm and lodge three miles from the trail, which was approved in early 2021.

The city is an important center of agribusiness, the area having the largest cattle stock in Maranhão. The production of pig iron is the municipality's biggest single economic activity. Açailândia is part of the Carajas Development Corridor and the city houses many of the workers who produce charcoal in the area. The city has one of the most important railway stations on the Carajás Railway line.
Açailândia's origins are recent, lying in the construction of the Belém-Brasília highway in 1958, when the fertile lands in the vicinity of the Açailândia Creek came to the attention of those engaged in building the highway. For some time, Açailândia was considered a district of the city of Imperatriz, the second largest city in the state of Maranhão.

River Dunsop

The River Dunsop is a river in the Forest of Bowland in Northern England. It flows into the River Hodder at Dunsop Bridge.
It begins at the confluence of the Brennand River and Whitendale River, both of which rise high up in the surrounding moorland. It then flows through the steep-sided Dunsop Valley before meeting the Hodder. An aqueduct carrying water to Blackburn runs alongside.
The Dunsop drains a catchment approximately 9 km by 5 km, which comprises the sub-catchment areas of the Brennand and Whitendale, and is classed as a fifth order catchment. The catchment is primarily Millstone Grit, but the tributaries run through older shale and limestone strata
On 8 August 1967 Dunsop Valley entered the UK Weather Records with the "Highest 90-min total" rainfall at 117 mm. The peak flow of the flood was deduced primarily from wrack mark evidence and roughness coefficients. As of July 2006 this record remains.

Liddel Water

Liddel Water is a river running through southern Scotland and northern England, for much of its course forming the border between the two countries, and was formerly one of the boundaries of the Debatable Lands.
Liddel Water's source is beneath Peel Fell in Roxburghshire, in the Scottish Borders, where it is formed by the confluence of Caddroun Burn, Wormscleuch Burn and Peel Burn (burn is the Scots term for a stream). Soon afterwards, the nascent Liddel Water is fed by Dawston Burn near the village of Saughtree.
The river continues to pick up tributaries (listed below) as it follows its southwesterly course, which takes it through the village of Newcastleton (also known as "Copshaw Holm") to that of Kershopefoot, where the burn begins to mark the Anglo-Scottish border.
Liddel Water then flows into the River Esk at Willow Pool, overlooked by the earthworks of the former castle of Liddel Strength near Carwinley, Cumbria.

Mediterranean Ridge

The Mediterranean Ridge is a wide ridge in the bed of the Mediterranean Sea, running along a rough quarter circle from Calabria, south of Crete, to the southwest corner of Turkey.
It is an accretionary wedge caused by the African Plate subducting under the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. As the African Plate moves slowly north-northeastward, the sedimentary rocks covering the Mediterranean seafloor are being affected by active shortening, involving both thrust faulting and folding, lifting them up and forming the ridge.
Along the ridge, five deep basins full of anoxic brine have been found (including the L'Atalante basin), where Messinian evaporite deposits of brine caught up in this ongoing orogeny have dissolved.
Incipient collision with Africa.
The central section of the Mediterranean Ridge shows evidence for the initial stages of collision with the Cyrenaica peninsula. Detailed bathymetric mapping using multibeam echosounders, shows that deformation within the "outer zone" (southernmost part) of the ridge, is much more intense against the promontory, with out-of-sequence thrusting replacing the gentle folding observed further east and west.

Tylosema

The genus Tylosema is in the plant family Fabaceae and encompasses four accepted species of perennial legumes native to southern and central Africa. These are semi-woody viniferous plants broadly distributed from Sudan and Ethiopia south to Angola and South Africa. Coetzer and Ross originally described four "Tylosema" species:
Species.
There are four documented species within the genus "Tylosema (Schweinf.) Torre &amp; Hillc.":
Proposed species:
Common names.
Creeping bauhinia (English), Gwangwandiza (Shona), Marama bean, gemsbok bean, tamani berry (English), Morama bean, gami (Khoi), Mubopo (Shona), Mutukutupasi (Shona), Umbama or Umdabule (Ndebele).
Habitat.
Habitat for "Tylosema" species is diverse and particular to each species. "T. esculentum" is found mostly on sandy plains, while T". fassoglense" can be found from open grassland to desert to woodlands to roadsides. All species are found from low to moderate altitude.
"Tylosema" species grow in mostly sandy soils with low rainfall and can tolerate scorching heat and long-term drought. Typical daily high temperatures average 37 °C during growing season and radiation frequently exceeds 2000 μmol m−2 s−1. Whereas many legumes can fix atmospheric nitrogen, all Tylosema species are non-nodulating.
Vegetation is a climbing vine, with some species reaching up to 6 m long. Herbaceous stems trail or climb, originating from a large underground tuber that is visible above the soil surface. Leaves are simple and 2-lobed. Forked tendrils are usually present. Inflorescence is a lateral raceme. Flowers are yellow, bisexual, heterostylous, with 5 petals. Pods are large, woody and have 1 or 2 seeds. Herostyly, or flower polymorphism, occurs in all species of Tylosema, although it is unknown in the rest of the family Leguminosae.
Phylogeny.
"Tylosema" species are in the family Leguminosae, the third largest family of flowering plants (Doyle and Luckow, 2003), in the subfamily Cercidoideae. The type species for the Tylosema genus is "T. fassoglense".
The phylogeny of Tylosema is somewhat disputed. This is in part because it has not been widely collected or studied. Although previously located in the Bauhinia genus, now Tylosema has been established as its own genus and is strongly supported as monophyletic.
Wunderlin has proposed a reorganization of the tribe Cercideae wherein 12 genera are placed into two subtribes, Cercinidae and Bauhiniinae. Bauhiniinae is divided into two clades, the first is poorly resolved and includes the genera Bauhinia, Brenierea and Piliostigma. The second clade comprises the genera Tylosema, Barklya, Gigasiphon, Lysiphyllum, Phanera, and Schnella.
Biology and use.
In Botswana and Namibia "T. esculentum", or Morama bean, is a staple food of the Khoisan people but plants have not been established for cultivation. The beans have high protein content (30-39%) and high oil content (36-43%)and are eaten after boiling or roasting. Beans also have significant levels of calcium, iron, zinc, phosphate, magnesium, and B vitamins including folate.
Preliminary research indicates that seeds of "T. esculentum" have no physiological dormancy, although germination is improved by scarification. It is disputed as to whether Morama beans exhibit antiviral and antimicrobial properties.
Research shows that "T. esculentum" is both drought avoidant and drought tolerant, but this has not been measured in other Tylosema species.

Hydraulic exercise equipment

Hydraulic exercise equipment is a form of strength training equipment based on fluid dynamics to provide motion resistance by use of hydraulic cylinders. They can be used in a number of strength training programs, and are most often found in circuit training gyms.
Hydraulic circuit training machines were first developed for The Henley Corporation in the 1970s, and are now becoming an increasingly popular form of exercise. 
The fundamental principles behind these designs are based on fluid dynamics: Force that is applied at one point is transmitted to another point using an incompressible fluid known as hydraulic oil.
For circuit training applications, each piece of equipment is specifically designed for a given exercise. The effort is applied through the range of motion of the exercise acts on a lever against a piston which moves linearly within a hydraulic cylinder. The cylinder is filled with hydraulic oil which is displaced by the motion of the piston, and is allowed to flow to the opposite side of the piston through an adjustable orifice.
Resistance to the motion is determined by the amount of effort applied and the adjustment size of the orifice. This is a key feature of this design and allows the resistance to be adjusted to an individual's strength level.

Antigone Kefala

Antigone Kefala (28 May 1931 – 3 December 2022) was an Australian poet and prose-writer of Greek-Romanian heritage. She was a member of the Literature Board of the Australia Council and is acknowledged as being an important voice in capturing the migrant experience in contemporary Australia. In 2017, Kefala was awarded the State Library of Queensland Poetry Collection Judith Wright Calanthe Award at the Queensland Literary Awards for her collection of poems entitled "Fragments".
Life.
Born in Brăila, Romania in 1931, Kefala and family moved to Greece and then New Zealand after World War II. Having studied French Literature at Victoria University and obtained a MA, she relocated to Sydney, Australia in 1960. There she taught English as a second language and worked as a university and arts administrator. Her poetry and prose is written in both Greek and English, with "Absence: New and Selected Poems" reissued in a second edition in 1998.
Her work, written in free verse, has been described as having an almost metaphysical detachment. It is characterised by an austere allusiveness unusual in Australian poetry. Aside from Greek and English it has been translated into Czech and French.
In 2009, "Antigone Kefala: A Writer’s Journey", an anthology of reviews, essays and analytical writing of Kefala's works edited by Professor Vrasidas Karalis and Helen Nickas was published by Owl Publishing. In 2021, a collection of essays on her prose and poetry titled "Antigone Kefala: New Australian Modernities", edited by Elizabeth McMahon and Brigitta Olubas, was published by UWA Publishing.
In November 2022, Kefala won the Patrick White Award. A week later, she died on 3 December 2022, at the age of 91.

Fireworks (1947 film)

Fireworks is a 1947 homoerotic experimental short film by Kenneth Anger. Filmed in his parents' home in Beverly Hills, California, over a long weekend while they were away, the film stars Anger and explicitly explores themes of homosexuality and sadomasochism. It is the earliest of his works to survive. "Fireworks" is known for being the first gay narrative film in the United States.
Anger synopsizes the film thus: "A dissatisfied dreamer awakes, goes out in the night seeking a 'light' and is drawn through the needle's eye. A dream of a dream, he returns to bed less empty than before." Adding later, "This flick is all I have to say about being seventeen, the United States Navy, American Christmas, and the Fourth of July."
Plot.
The film opens with the image of a sailor holding a lifeless body. A sleeping man (portrayed by Anger) wakes up in bed and gets dressed. The dreamer walks through a door labeled "Gents", to find himself in a bar. He admires the body of a muscular sailor and offers his cigarette, only for the sailor to attack him. The sailor uses a flaming bundle of sticks to light the dreamer's cigarette.
His smoking is interrupted by a group of sailors who chase the man and pin him to the ground. They beat the dreamer and reach into his chest to find a ticking meter inside him. White liquid pours down his body. A sailor unbuttons the crotch of his pants to reveal a Roman candle, which shoots sparks into the air. The dreamer appears with a Christmas tree as a headdress, moving toward a fireplace in which several photographs of the opening shot are burning. The dreamer then appears asleep in bed, next to a man whose head is radiating light.
Production.
Development.
During the Zoot Suit Riots, Anger witnessed a group of sailors in white uniforms chase down Mexican men and attack them. He had a persistent dream of men in white uniforms attacking at night, which eventually became a dream about people chasing him. This dream became the premise for "Fireworks".
Anger stars in "Fireworks" as the dreamer, and Gordon Gray plays the sailor from the opening scene. According to Anger's account, he found the cast of "Fireworks" while sitting in on film classes at UCLA. He convinced some classmates who were in the Navy to steal a few thousand feet of Navy film stock for him to use. They acted in his film, using their summer uniforms as costumes. Ed Earle, a friend of Anger's, has disputed this account, saying that the cast were not sailors, but "people dressed up…He talked everyone into doing it because it was almost as though he was going to make the ultimate porno film."
Principal photography.
Anger upgraded from a spring-wound camera when his grandmother gave him a Bell &amp; Howell 16 mm camera as a birthday gift, which allowed him to film at 24 frames per second. Anger placed the shoot at his parents' home in Beverly Hills over three days; however, his older brother Bob has stated that "Fireworks" was shot at a home in the Hollywood Hills. One scene was shot in a public bathroom at a park in Olive Hill, California.
Post-production.
When editing the film, Anger directly scratched the film stock for two scenes. Worried that he might get in trouble trying to sell prints of "Fireworks" by mail, he scratched out his genitals from one brief shot in a public urinal. In the film's ending, Anger etched in a corona of light around a man's face. He scored the film with Ottorino Respighi's "Pines of Rome".
Themes.
Anger was a disciple of occultist Aleister Crowley, through whose teachings "Fireworks" can be read. The dreamer in the film follows a symbolic process of death, rebirth, and self-realization similar to the Liber Pyramidos, a ritual for self-initiation. In this sense, the "light" sought by the dreamer is a pun, playing off of Lucifer.
The opening scene in which a sailor carries the lifeless body of the dreamer closely follows the Christian image of the pietà, in which the Virgin Mary cradles the dead body of Jesus. Anger's camp re-creation is emphasized with intense, expressionistic lighting of the subject against a dark background; thunder and lightning; and a dolly shot that gradually reveals the scene. This scene and its reappearance as a photograph later in the film conflate masochistic desire with redemptive suffering. Anger has described the role of the sailor by saying that he "was a kind of sex symbol on one level, and on another level there was a great deal of ambivalence and hostility, and fear in the image."
Release.
"Fireworks" was screened privately several times before its public premiere. It first screened publicly in 1947 at the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles. Anger sold the first print of "Fireworks" to Alfred Kinsey. Cinema 16 acquired and distributed the film.
Anger continued to make changes to the film after its original release. These edits included truncating a scene where the dreamer writhes on a bathroom floor before the sailors attack him and shortening the moment when Gordon Gray unbuttons his pants to reveal a firecracker. One version used hand tinting for the candle atop the Christmas tree and the halo of light. The use of color bridged "Fireworks" with Anger's later film "Eaux d'Artifice", which similarly ends with a hand-tinted object.
Rohauer case.
Raymond Rohauer of the Coronet Theatre obtained a copy of the film which Anger attempted to recover. After screening "Fireworks" on October 11, 1957, Rohauer was arrested on obscenity charges. William C. Doran served as prosecutor, with much of his case focusing on the Coronet and its homosexual patrons rather than the content of the film. Doran zeroed in on the sailor with a firecracker and, despite the lack of nudity in "Fireworks", persistently referred to it as "the penis scene". Rohauer was found guilty in February 1958 and received a sentence of three years probation with a $250 fine.
Civil rights attorney Stanley Fleishman appealed the decision to the California Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Rohauer. The court ruled that homosexuality was a valid subject of artistic expression and that overt reference to it could not be considered obscenity. This ruling became a landmark decision for freedom of speech in the United States. Fleishman successfully defended one of Anger's later films, "Scorpio Rising", in a similar obscenity trial.
Critical reception.
Critic Lewis Jacobs of "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote that the taboo subject matter was effectively conveyed through "the film's intensity of imagery, the strength and precision of its shots and continuity," making "Fireworks" a work of "rare individuality which no literal summary of its qualities can communicate." Tennessee Williams called "Fireworks" "the most exciting use of cinema I have ever seen." Anger submitted "Fireworks" to the Festival du Film Maudit in 1949, where the jury awarded it the Poetic Film Prize.
Legacy.
Anger's 1953 film "Eaux d'Artifice" takes its title from "feux d'artifice", the French translation of "fireworks". His 1969 film "Invocation of My Demon Brother" is a remake of "Fireworks". Anthology Film Archives added "Fireworks" to its Essential Cinema Repertory collection.
"Fireworks" was an influence on Robert Duncan's poetry. His poem "The Earth" explicitly mentions the film, and his poems "The Torso" and "An Illustration" both make reference to it.

Gene and The Gents

Gene and The Gents were a Northern Irish pop showband from Enniskillen, who achieved chart success with tracks including "The Way You Wrinkle Your Nose" and "I Came As a Stranger and Stayed As a Friend" as well as "Puppet on a String".
Early years.
The band was founded in 1964, with four members of the Enniskillen-based Skyrockets (Paddy McDermott on tenor saxophone (born in 1940, in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland); Dermot Doherty on trombone (born in 1940 in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland); Pete Watson on drums (born in 1938, in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland) and Henry McCullough on lead guitar. The band was joined by Tony Gallagher on rhythm guitar (born in 1943 in Strabane, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland) and Barry Scully on bass (born in 1944, in County Dublin, Ireland, died 10 December 2007, of a heart attack).
The band advertised for a lead singer and found one in Gene Chetty (born Dushy Anthon Chetty, 2 January 1944, in Durban, South Africa), a Trinity College law student, who had come over in 1962 to study law. He auditioned for the group and got the job. The Gents made their debut on St Patrick's Night, 17 March 1964 at The County Hall in Monaghan. McCullough left in 1966 and was replaced by Pete Cresswell (born Peter Cresswell, February 1944, Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey) as lead guitarist from London, who originally had played on a hit record in 1961 by Bobby Angelo and the Tuxedos called "Baby Sittin". McDermott left in early 1968 and was replaced by Mal Kearns on tenor saxophone, vocals (born Malachy Kearns). Barry Scully left in early 1969, and was replaced by Davy Quinn until the band split in April 1969.

2007 Speedway Grand Prix

The 2007 Speedway Grand Prix was the 62nd edition of the official World Championship and the 13th season in the Speedway Grand Prix era used to determine the Speedway World Champion. It was the first under the promotion of IMG, who had purchased series organisers Benfield Sports International (BSI).
Event format.
The format for 2007 was a revision of that used in 2006, with 16 riders taking part in each Grand Prix and over the course of 20 heats each rider racing against every other rider once. The top 8 scorers advanced to a semi-final and from each semi-final the 1st and 2nd placed riders advanced to the Grand Prix final.
All rides counted towards Grand Prix points totals, including the semi-final and final, which counted as double (6-4-2-0) and therefore the maximum points for a single Grand Prix was 24 (5x heat wins, semi final win and final win). This scoring revision was introduced as a result of comments made during 2006 that the four finalists received too many points compared to the losing semi-finalists who received little benefit compared to the 9th placed non-qualifier. This format also meant that the winner of each Grand Prix may not be the rider who scores most Grand Prix points from each race.

Brad Mackay

Brad Mackay (born 1969 in Sydney, New South Wales) is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s and 1990s. A versatile for the St George Dragons, Illawarra Steelers, Western Reds and the joint-venture of St. George Illawarra Dragons, he also represented New South Wales in the State of Origin and Australia.
Playing career.
A St George junior from the Brighton Seagulls club, Mackay was graded by the Dragons in 1987 and then played 117 games with club over eight seasons until 1994 scoring 22 tries. Playing all positions in the backline bar halfback, he was most remembered for his lock position in his peak.
Mackay debuted for the New South Wales Blues as a reserve in game II of the 1989 State of Origin series. He went on to play 17 Origin games between 1989 and 1995, scoring three tries at that level.
Mackay had his best season in 1990, making his test début for Australia in the mid-season test against France, becoming only the second player to score a hat trick of tries on début for Australia. A month after the France test, Mackay went on to play in a one-off test against New Zealand. Following the season he was selected for the 1990 Kangaroo Tour, coming into the test team for the winning 2nd and 3rd Ashes Tests against Great Britain before playing in the two tests against France.
After failing to hold his test place in 1991, Mackay was selected for the first two tests against Great Britain during the Lions 1992 tour of Australasia but missed the last match of the series through injury. After playing in a World Cup qualifying match against Papua New Guinea in Townsville, Mackay was used as a replacement in the Dragons 8-28 Grand Final loss to the Brisbane Broncos and missed a place in Australia's World Cup Final winning team.
1993 saw Mackay continue his good form and he was the starting lock forward for NSW in all three State of Origin games in the Blues 2–1 series win over Queensland. The return from injury of Bradley Clyde would see Mackay on the bench for Australia in the 1st and 3rd Trans-Tasman Tests against New Zealand.
Later that year he became one of only four players (the others being Bradley Clyde in 1991, Daly Cherry-Evans in 2013 and Jack Wighton in 2019) to win the Clive Churchill Medal from the losing side when the Dragons went down 6–14 in the Grand Final, again to the Brisbane Broncos.
St. George's form dropped markedly in 1994 and Mackay could only make the Bench for NSW in their 1994 State of Origin series win over Queensland, with NSW coach Phil Gould preferring Bradley Clyde at lock. He made his final test appearance for Australia from the interchange bench in the 1994 mid-season test against France at Parramatta Stadium, but the Dragons poor form, which saw them fall to 11th on the premiership ladder, saw Mackay overlooked for the 1994 Kangaroo Tour bringing down the curtain on his international career.
Mackay decided to leave the Dragons due to a poor relationship with coach Brian Smith, later saying, "Brian had signed an extension on his contract and so I felt like I needed a change or I'd go down the drain as a player."
Mackay joined the Western Reds in 1995, accepting the foundation captaincy of the Perth-based side, but moved back east when they joined the Super League franchise from 1996.
He started playing for the Illawarra Steelers in 1996, staying for three seasons over which he played 56 games. A return to his best form and season-long consistency in 1997 earned him the BHP Medal as the Steelers' player of the year. Mackay later became part of the new St. George when the joint venture was formed in 1999, playing 24 games, including an appearance from the bench in the 1999 NRL Grand Final loss to the Melbourne Storm.
Mackay had played a total of 248 first grade games over 12 years.
Mackay played out his career in the 2000 season with the Bradford Bulls in the UK, winning the Challenge Cup Final with them.
Post playing.
Brad Mackay is a committed Christian. In 2003, he was active in fund raising for the Joanne Mackay Helping Hand Foundation following the 2002 passing of wife, Joanne from breast cancer.
He lives in the Illawarra area with his second wife, Tracy and is a fireman.

Hakea salicifolia

Hakea salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved hakea, is a species of flowering plant that is endemic to eastern Australia. It is an adaptable, fast growing small tree or shrub with attractive foliage and cream white flowers.
Description.
"Hakea salicifolia" is a fast-growing upright shrub or small tree to tall. Smaller branches are smooth with obvious dark red longitudinal ribbing. Young shoots have sparse silky hairs or may be totally hairless. Leaves are narrowly oval shaped, widest in the middle up to 12 cm long and wide tapering to a point or occasionally rounded at the apex. The pale green leaves are smooth, occasionally bluish-green with a powdery film. Young leaves are darker with sparse flattened silky white and rusty coloured hairs quickly becoming smooth. The inflorescence consists of a single umbel of 16–28 white to pale yellow flowers on a short stalk long. The young flower bracts are long and slightly hairy externally. The pedicel is long. The perianth is smooth, bluish-green with a powdery film and long. The style long. Egg-shaped fruit are long and wide narrowing gradually to a slightly upturned beak with small horns. The fruit surface is covered with black blister-like warts high.
Taxonomy and naming.
Willow-leaved hakea was first formally described in 1800 by French botanist Étienne Pierre Ventenat who gave it the name "Embrothium salicifolium" and published the description in "Description des Plantes Nouvelles et peu connues, cultivees dans le Jardin de J.M. Cels". The type specimen was grown in the garden of Jacques Philippe Martin Cels from material collected from Botany Bay in 1792. In 1941, English botanist Brian Burtt changed the name to "Hakea salicifolia" and published the description in "Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information". The specific epithet "(salicifolia)" is derived from the Latin words "salix" meaning "willow" and "folium" meaning "leaf" referring to the willow-like leaves.
Two subspecies are currently recognised by the Australian Plant Census:
"Hakea saligna" var. "angustifolia" was first formally described in 1920 by Arthur Andrew Hamilton in "Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales" before being renamed "Hakea salicifolia" subsp. "angustifolia" in 1999 by William Robert Barker.
Distribution and habitat.
"Hakea salicifolia" is a widespread species growing mainly from Kempsey to the Shoalhaven River, Dorrigo, Whian Whian and the Blue Mountains. Also found near the Queensland and New South Wales border. Grows in wet sclerophyll forest often near rainforest. 
Ecology.
Willow-leaved Hakea is an invasive plant species in New Zealand and is listed by the New Zealand Department of Conservation as one of about 300 environmental weeds. It is also invasive in Portugal. An attractive ornamental tree adaptable to most soils and aspects from sub-tropical to temperate zones creating issues with over abundance of the species in some localities. Planted on tea plantations in Tanzania as a wind-break and boundary hedge.

River Calder, Wyre

The River Calder is a long river that is one of the main tributaries of the River Wyre in Lancashire, England. Like the other rivers in England with the name Calder, its name is thought to derive from a mixture of Old Welsh and Old British words meaning "hard and violent water or stream".
Description.
The river rises near Fiendsdale Head in the Forest of Bowland and flows first westwards then southwards through the villages of Oakenclough and Calder Vale before passing under the M6 motorway, West Coast Main Line and under the Calder Aqueduct on Lancaster Canal. It meets the Wyre at Catterall near the town of Garstang, at which point the Calder forms the boundary between the parishes of Catterall and Barnacre-with-Bonds.
Just west of the M6 Motorway, a feeder section supplies water via a siphon from the River Calder to the Lancaster canal; this intake has the ability to abstract the entire flow of water from the River Calder causing critical flow conditions further west of this point to its mouth with the River Wyre. Similarly, Barnacre and Grizedale Lea Reservoirs, which built in the 1800s just west of Oakenclough, can take all the flow from the upper reaches of the River Calder with no compensation during periods of low flow.
The Calder is one of two rivers in Lancashire with the same name; the other River Calder flows from Burnley and into the River Ribble.

In 1952 he moved to Torino's cross-city rivals Juventus, playing for the "Bianconeri" for only a season, after which he went to Genoa. In 1957 he returned to Serie B with Catania where he ended his career in 1959. In total, he played 318 matches throughout his career and scored 111 goals.
International career.
With the Italy national football team, Carapellese made his debut in November 1947 in a 5–1 away defeat against Austria, scoring the only goal of the match for Italy. He participated at the 1950 FIFA World Cup as Italy's captain, scoring two goals in his nation's matches with Sweden and Paraguay.
Personal life.
Carapellese was born in Cerignola, province of Foggia. He died in Rapallo in 1995 at 73 years of age.

Earl G. Graves Sr.

Earl Gilbert Graves Sr. (January 9, 1935 – April 6, 2020) was an American entrepreneur, publisher, businessman, philanthropist, and advocate of African-American businesses. A graduate of Morgan State University, he was the founder of "Black Enterprise" magazine and chairman of the media company Earl G. Graves, Ltd. He was the director for Aetna and Executive Board member of the Boy Scouts of America. He was the father of Earl G. Graves Jr.
Background.
Born in Brooklyn, New York, to Earl Graves, an immigrant from Barbados, and Winifred (Sealy) Graves, who was from Trinidad. Graves grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of New York City. A member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics in 1958 from Morgan State University. He was an ROTC graduate and attended Airborne and Ranger Schools.
Having written a letter to the Democratic National Committee, he became a volunteer for the 1964 presidential campaign of Lyndon B. Johnson. His work with the party gave Graves the opportunity to be administrative assistant to newly elected Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1965. Following the assassination of the senator, Graves would land a seat on the advisory board of the Small Business Administration (SBA) in 1968.
Business ventures.
He undertook his first job at the age of seven selling boxed Christmas cards for his uncle. His territory was severely limited due to his father's rule that he could only sell to people living on their side of the block.
While at Morgan State University, Graves made a name for himself as an entrepreneur. Realizing that there was a big market for flowers during Homecoming Week, he went to two competing local florists and cut deals with both to sell flowers on campus. For a percentage of the profits, the florists provided the flowers while Graves covered the campus.
His time on the SBA's advisory board and his direct work with the agency would lead Graves to his belief in the need for advice to businesses in economic development and urban affairs, which convinced him to create an annual newsletter that would chronicle issues relevant to black business people, and raise awareness of the importance of black consumer power. At the suggestion of then SBA Director Howard J. Samuels, Graves would expand the concept of a newsletter into a full-fledged magazine.
Graves started Earl G. Graves, Ltd, and under that holding company he began the Earl G. Graves Associates management consulting firm. In August 1970, the first issue of "Black Enterprise" magazine would hit newsstands. Earl G. Graves, Ltd would grow to include a number of divisions including publishing, marketing, radio, television and event coordinating arms. The firm is the co-owner of the private equity fund Black Enterprise Greenwich Street Corporate Growth Fund, an equity partnership formed with Travelers Group, Inc. The fund aims to invest and promote minority operated businesses.
In 1990, Graves and Magic Johnson purchased the Pepsi Cola bottling franchise in Washington D.C., and Graves was CEO until 1998, when he sold his ownership to Pepsi. He held board and director memberships with a number of other corporations, including AMR Corporation, Daimler AG, Federated Department Stores and Rohm and Haas, as well as board member of the American Museum of Natural History and Hayden Planetarium in New York City. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of Howard University.
Awards and other accomplishments.
Graves received the Silver Buffalo Award from the Boy Scouts of America in 1988, and was the National Commissioner from 1985 to 1994. He received the NAACP's Spingarn Medal in 1999. In 2002, Graves was named as one of the 50 most powerful and influential African Americans in corporate America by "Fortune" magazine.
Graves was appointed by the administration of George W. Bush to be on the Presidential Commission for the National Museum of African American History and Culture. On April 26, 2007, Earl G. Graves Sr. was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame. In 2009, he became the recipient of the 2009 NCAA Silver Anniversary Award.
In his honor, Morgan State University's business school was named Earl G. Graves School of Business and Management. It was opened in 2015.
A "special thanks" to Mr. Graves is included in Bayer Mack's documentary "".
Death.
Graves died in White Plains, New York, on April 6, 2020, from complications of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 85.

Girl (1998 film)

Girl is a 1998 American drama film starring Dominique Swain, Christopher Masterson, Selma Blair, Tara Reid, Summer Phoenix, Portia de Rossi and Sean Patrick Flanery. It was based on the novel of the same name, written by Blake Nelson. It was written by Blake Nelson and David E. Tolchinsky and directed by Jonathan Kahn.
Plot.
Andrea Marr (Dominique Swain) is a bright, straight-A, 18-year-old high school senior living a sheltered life in rural Washington. She has two close friends, bookish Darcy (Selma Blair) and rebellious aspiring rock star Cybil (Tara Reid). Andrea is insecure and confused by her budding sexuality. She has difficulty viewing herself as a woman. 
In pursuit of becoming "women," Andrea and Darcy attend a frat party in attempts to lose their virginity. Both are unsuccessful, and Andrea ends up passing out and waking up with a frat boy masturbating on top of her. Upon learning of her acceptance to Brown University, Andrea realizes that she hasn't had many life experiences, so she ventures into the local rock scene with classmate and groupie, Rebecca (Summer Phoenix), to watch Cybil and her band, which is made up of two other classmates, Richard (Christopher Masterson) and Greg (David Moscow). There, she meets Todd Sparrow (Sean Patrick Flanery), the singer for a local rock band called The Color Green, and she becomes enamored with him. Andrea loses her virginity to a guy named Kevin (Channon Roe) whom she also met at the show, but she finds the experience disappointing. Later, she finds Todd at a record store and accompanies him back to his sister Carla's (Portia De Rossi) apartment where they have sex. After, Todd leaves abruptly to go to band practice, leaving Andrea upset but also obsessed with him. Andrea begins to neglect her friends, particularly Darcy, who is suffering from an eating disorder, in her pursuit of Todd.
In the meantime, Cybil reveals to Andrea that she's dropping out of high school because she got a record deal on the same label as Todd’s band. However, the record deal was only offered to her and not to Richard and Greg. Richard is upset but ultimately accepting of it, whereas Greg becomes severely depressed. Cybil and her new band open for The Color Green, and Andrea goes to the show. At the show, Andrea and Todd reunite, and Andrea becomes Todd's groupie, meaning they often get together to have sex. Andrea believes it means something more, but Todd eventually breaks things off with her to go on tour, leaving her heartbroken.
Graduation day comes along, and Andrea is very somber. Unbeknownst to her, Todd comes to the ceremony and watches her from the parking lot before driving off. Andrea finds a crying Richard at graduation and learns that Greg committed suicide. Andrea goes to the class graduation party. At the party, Andrea goes upstairs and finds Darcy making herself throw up in the bathroom. Andrea apologizes to Darcy about neglecting her and makes her promise to seek treatment for her eating disorder, which Darcy agrees to. Darcy reveals that she was very jealous of Andrea because she appeared to have everything. Andrea helps Darcy clean up. When they leave the bathroom, Andrea and Darcy are verbally harassed by a classmate who used to bully Richard and Greg. Richard intervenes, reveals his longtime crush on Darcy, and asks her to dance, to which Darcy agrees. Andrea watches Darcy and Richard dance, then is approached by Cybil, who showed up to the party. Cybil expresses regret and sadness over Greg's suicide and says that she feels responsible. Andrea consoles her, and Cybil reveals her feelings for Andrea by kissing her on the lips. Andrea is surprised, and even though she doesn't reciprocate those feelings, she allows Cybil to kiss her anyway. Andrea leaves the party.
After the party, Andrea walks around for a while, thinking about everything that's happened, and she encounters Todd. They go back to Carla’s apartment to talk, and Todd opens up to Andrea. He apologizes for treating her so badly and tells her that he can't go on tour without her and that he needs her. Andrea reveals that she's going to Brown in the fall, and Todd is surprised at how smart she actually is. They attempt to have sex, but they can't because Todd is unable to get an erection. Andrea leaves, breaking things off with Todd for good.
Andrea leaves for college, hopeful for her future and grateful for the experiences she’s had, declaring herself a woman.

Barbadians

 
Barbadians, more commonly known as Bajans (pronounced ), are people who are identified with the country of Barbados, by being citizens or their descendants in the Bajan diaspora. The connection may be residential, legal, historical or cultural. For most Bajans, several (or all) of those connections exist and are collectively the source of their identity. Bajans are a multi-ethnic and multicultural society of various ethnic, religious and national origins; therefore Bajans do not necessarily equate their ethnicity with their Bajan nationality.
History.
The earliest inhabitants of Barbados were indigenous Kalinago (Caribs) and Arawaks from South America. Between 1536 and 1550, Spanish raiders regularly seized large numbers of indigenous Taino and Kalinago from Barbados to be used as slave labour on regional plantations. This prompted the Kalinago to flee the island for other Caribbean destinations such as Dominica and St Vincent. The first European settlement on Barbados were English colonists. Africans were brought to Barbados during the slave trade.
Ethnic groups.
Most Barbadians are of African or mixed-race descent. They are descendants of enslaved people brought from West Africa. Mixed-race Barbadians are descendants of Europeans, Africans, and other ethnic groups. White Barbadians are mainly of British and Irish descent. There is also a small population of Syrians, Lebanese, Jewish, Indian and Chinese people in the country. Scotland deported Roma to Barbados in the seventeenth century. Barbados has a small Asian population who are mainly Indians. The Asians were brought to Barbados as indentured labourers in the late 19th century. Barbados's Indian population also come from Guyana. Indians have influenced Barbadian cuisine, music, and culture. Barbados is also home to expatriates from other countries who mainly come from the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.
The largest ethnic groups in Barbados is black (92.4%) or mixed (3.1%). 2.7% of Barbados' population is white and 1.3% South Asian. The remaining 0.4% are East Asians (0.1%) and Middle Easterners (0.1%).
Culture.
Barbadian culture is influenced by African, European, and Indigenous traditions. Barbados is famous for its music, with genres such as calypso, soca, and reggae being the most popular in the country. Rihanna is one of the most well-known Barbadian musicians. Barbadian cuisine is a fusion of African, European, indigenous and Caribbean influences. Some of Barbados's most popular dishes are cou-cou and flying fish. Barbados's rum industry is a significant contributor to Barbadian culture and history.
Diaspora.
Many Barbadians now live overseas and outside of Barbados; the majority have migrated to Anglophone countries, including around 65,000 in the United States, 37,780 in Canada, some 19,000 in the United Kingdom, and some 500–1,000 Barbadians in Liberia. In addition to Anglophone countries other groups of Barbadians have moved to Latin countries including Brazil, Cuba and Panama.

Ducati Hypermotard

The Ducati Hypermotard is a supermotard Ducati motorcycle designed by Pierre Terblanche and was first seen at the November 2005 EICMA trade show in Milan. The Hypermotard was awarded "Best of Show" at EICMA and has since won other show awards.
The Hypermotard has a dual-spark (see 2010 MY revisions) 'Desmo' or 'Desmodromic' liquid-cooled four-valve-per-cylinder 90° V-twin engine with fuel injection and weighs under . The Hypermotard is capable of speeds in the region of .
The rigidly triangulated trellis frame wears 50 mm Marzocchi R.A.C. inverted forks, and has a Sachs/Öhlins remote reservoir shock attached to a strong, single-sided swing arm. The Marchesini racing wheels wear dual radially mounted Brembo four-piston, two-pad brake calipers matched with 305 mm discs up front, and a 245 mm disc with two-piston caliper at the rear.top speed | 137
History.
There had been rumours for some time that Ducati would produce a supermotard class bike, which was a growing sector of the market mostly catered-for by the likes of KTM and Husqvarna. The unveiling of the Hypermotard concept was via a dedicated mini-site, linked to from the main Ducati website in March 2006. This apparently caused outages of the whole Ducati website, such was the interest in this distinctive-looking motorcycle.
The mini-site asked visitors to complete an online survey giving their opinion on the Hypermotard, as well as offering the opportunity to vote on configurations such as engine size, brakes and favourite features. The bike was still in concept form at the time and production was not guaranteed, but a subsequent post to the blog of then Ducati CEO Federico Minoli on 31 March 2006 confirmed that it would indeed go into production and also gave some details of the survey results.
Very few changes were made to the prototype to create the first production version, and quirky features such as the 'duck bill' front fender and handguards incorporating LED indicators/folding mirrors made it to the final version. Later blog entries featured some of the concept drawings and these are incredibly close to the finished machine.
In 2008, Greg Tracy won the 1200 Pro Class Division of the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb on a Hypermotard 1100S. It was the first Hypermotard to win an international competition and the first Ducati to win at the Pikes Peak since the race began in 1916.
Hypermotard 1100 revisions.
The first 2007 Hypermotard was available in two configurations: the base '1100' model and the higher specification '1100S' model. The more expensive 1100S featured a durable low friction diamond-like carbon (DLC) black coating to the front fork sliders, an Öhlins remote reservoir rear shock, the same Brembo Monobloc brake calipers used on the 1098, lighter forged aluminium Marchesini wheels with a red pin-stripe, Pirelli tires, plus carbon fibre fork protectors, timing belt covers, front mudguard/fender and tail/exhaust side panels. These upgrades made for a weight saving; versus for the base model.
The specification remained virtually the same for 2009; however, the 1100S model received 48 mm Kayaba forks (with DLC coating) to replace the 50 mm Marzocchi items, while lower-spec Marzocchi forks continued to be offered on the base model. Also, for 2009 the 1100S model came with Ducati's DDA telemetry/data-logging device and software.
For 2010, the Hypermotard 1100 has been changed enough for the two models to receive new names reflecting the fact that the bike has 'evolved'. The 1100 Evo and the more expensive top-of-the-line 1100 Evo SP feature a redesigned engine which is no longer Dual Spark and has Siemens fuel injection in place of the previous models' Marelli system. The higher-compression engine is said to give more, outputting at a slightly lower engine speed of 7,500 rpm. Torque is fractionally lower than it was before at 75.9 lb-ft (10.5kgm), but peak torque appears 1,000 rpm higher in the rev range at 5750 rpm, which Ducati say allows owners to hang on to gears for longer. A new oil cooler has been fitted, with 85% more cooling area than before. The final drive gearing has also changed from 15/42 to 15/41.
The Evo features 50 mm Marzocchi forks and a Sachs rear shock, but the Evo SP features specially developed (1.2") taller 50 mm Marzocchi forks together with an Ohlins adjustable rear shock. The colour of the fork stanchions on both models is now black, the Evo SP also featuring a black DLC coating to the lower fork section. The Evo SP has a seat height of and is deliberately a taller bike because Ducati say that racers were asking for more ground clearance. The Evo, and all previous Hypermotard 1100 models, has a seat height of . To complement the increased ride height of the Evo SP, it features handlebars that sit 20 mm higher than those on the base model. The speedometer unit is now similar to that fitted to the Ducati Streetfighter, with white backlighting.
The 2010 Hypermotard 1100 bikes are both considerably lighter than before, mainly due to the vacuum-cast engine casings, lighter crankshaft, flywheel and alternator, but the rear subframe has also been redesigned and both bikes carry some carbon fibre. The Evo SP gets the full complement of carbon fibre, as the 'S' model before it, but a rear hugger is now standard on the SP. The Evo model weighs versus for the Evo SP, the latter's forged Marchesini alloy wheels making the difference. The Evo has Pirelli Diablo Rosso tyres and the Evo SP has Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa SP. The SP comes with Ducati's DDA device software.
Custom models.
In November 2007, NCR announced the production of the 'Leggera', essentially a highly modified Hypermotard which was over lighter and had around more than the standard bike. It cost several times the asking price of the standard Hypermotard 1100S.
In December 2007, Roland Sands of Roland Sands Design (RSD) was commissioned by Ducati North America to build a custom Hypermotard. The modifications made were mainly cosmetic.
Ducati North America also began offering a Tri-colore special edition Ducati Hypermotard, with a modified racing seat, ECU, and sport exhaust. It was released in the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog in the Fall of 2008.
Hypermotard 796.
In late 2009, Ducati introduced a new Hypermotard model – the 796 – featuring a 20 mm lower seat height (825 mm) and a smaller-capacity, less powerful engine. The 800 cc engine features Siemens fuel injection and is derived from the Monster. Power output is , just 9 bhp less than the 2007–2009 1100 models, although torque output is considerably lower.
The 796 has a wet 'slipper' clutch, not a Ducati trademark dry clutch as fitted to the 1100 models. The bike is lighter than any of the 1100 models at , although the difference is less marked when compared to the 2010 Evo and Evo SP.
Pirelli Diablo Rosso tyres are fitted in the same sizes used on the Hypermotard 1100, but the 796 uses less substantial, non-adjustable 43 mm Marzocchi forks and has Sachs rear suspension. The single-sided swinging arm and fold-out mirrors of the 1100 model are retained. The aluminium wheels are made by Enkei.
The speedometer unit is similar to that fitted to the Ducati Streetfighter, with orange backlighting to differentiate the 796 from the 2010 1100 models.
2013 model year.
Ducati unveiled the 2013 Ducati Hypermotard lineup in November 2012. The three new models received countless updates from frame, body, suspension, exhaust, electronics and ergonomics.
The base model Hypermotard has a new 11-degree Testastretta 821 cc engine with longer valve service intervals (), ride-by-wire, traction control and ABS and a fuel tank. The Hypermotard line up also uses a new display and ride-by-wire system allowing riders to switch between different traction/ABS/throttle modes for street, track and rain.
The Hypermotard SP has a slightly lesser weight due to the use of carbon fibre engine and body components, and has higher suspension travel and response similar to the last generation. It also utilises 821 cc engine and lightweight wheels similar to those on the 1199 Panigale S.
2019 Model - Present.
The Ducati Hypermotard 950 family is updated for the Model Year 2022 and sees the entry into the range of a new livery for the SP version. All models become compliant with Euro 5 anti-pollution regulations.
The Borgo Panigale fun-bike family consists of three models: Hypermotard 950, Hypermotard 950 RVE and Hypermotard 950 SP. Three different choices, which allow the rider both to have fun in curves and to easily tackle city traffic with all the safety offered by Ducati's sophisticated electronic equipment.
The design of the Hypermotard 950 is inspired by the look of motards and revolves around the twin under-seat exhaust and the reduced superstructures that leave the mechanical components visible, including the trellis rear frame that communicates lightness and essentiality. The ergonomics of the bike, also derived from the motard world, ensure a riding position with an upright torso and wide elbows which translates into a great vehicle control, while the flat seat guarantees the possibility of wide longitudinal movements.
The new livery of the SP version recalls the world of MotoGP in its choice of colours and that of ‘freestyle sports’ in its graphic lines, underlining the dynamic and fun character of the bike. The Hypermotard 950 SP represents the top of the range and is distinguished from the other two models by Öhlins suspension with increased travel, Marchesini forged wheels and standard Ducati Quick Shift (DQS) Up and Down EVO.
The engine of the Hypermotard 950 family is the 937 cc Ducati Testastretta 11° twin-cylinder unit, capable of delivering 114 hp at 9,000 rpm and generating flat-cornered torque whose peak is 9.8 kgm at 7,250 rpm. These power and torque values remain unchanged with the transition to Euro 5 homologation.
The gearbox has been revised to make it easier to engage neutral when the bike is stationary and to ensure maximum precision in gear selection, adopting the same technical solution of the Monster and the SuperSport 950. The system envisages that the gearshift drum rotates on bearings, ensuring a movement with reduced friction. In addition, the gear lever spring is more loaded to prevent the system from remaining idle in the intermediate positions, thus resulting more precise.
The Hypermotard 950 in Ducati Red colour scheme, the Hypermotard 950 RVE characterized by “Graffiti” livery and the Hypermotard 950 SP in the new “SP” colour will be available for purchase in all Ducati network dealers starting from June 2021. The motorcycles are also available in a depowered version for A2 license holders. In Italy, on all the Borgo Panigale 35 kW bikes, Ducati offers a discount of €1,000 on the list price to encourage the entry of young enthusiasts into the world of two wheels.

Sheffield Chamber Orchestra

The Sheffield Chamber Orchestra is a small classical music orchestra founded in 1950. As of 2025 the orchestra comprises about 35 players, mostly amateur musicians. The orchestra performs thrice annually in churches around the city of Sheffield. The orchestra is a member of the Making Music organisation. They play a variety of classical music, from the baroque period to contemporary compositions. The group's headquarters are at 73 Holmley Lane in Dronfield, S18 postal district. Since 2024 Laurence Perkins has been the orchestra's principal conductor and artistic director.
Its founders included Stewart Deas, a professor of music at the University of Sheffield, and Eric Laughton, a professor of Latin at the same institution; Deas died in 1985 and Laughton in 1988, but "The Times" noted the orchestra, as well as another organisation Deas founded, the Sheffield Bach Society, continued "to play an active part in Sheffield's musical life". In fact, the orchestra was known until 1955 as the "Sheffield Bach Orchestra". The orchestra, as well as the Bach society, were both associated with the university, although by no means exclusively composed of university people. Since 1979 the orchestra has been a registered charity in the United Kingdom. As of 2025 there were five trustees and the group had a total expenditure of around £12,000 in the 2024 financial year.

The Death of Achilles

The Death of Achilles () is the fourth novel in the Erast Fandorin historical detective series by Russian writer Boris Akunin. Its subtitle is "детектив о наемном убийце" ("a detective novel about a murderer-for-hire"). It was originally published in Russian in 1998; the English translation was released in 2006.
Plot.
Moscow, 1882. When Fandorin returns from Japan with his manservant Masa, he enters into the service of Moscow governor Prince Dolgorukoi. Later that day, the General Mikhail Sobolev, nicknamed the Russian Achilles and an old friend of Fandorin's, is found dead in the same hotel. Officially, he died of a heart attack, but Fandorin becomes suspicious when he talks with the bodyguards of the general. Fandorin had befriended these cossacks when he rooted out a Turkish spy during the siege of Plevna (see "The Turkish Gambit"). But the same cossacks now treat him with hostility.
Fandorin finds out the reason for their hostility as he discovers that the general had not really died in the hotel, but was moved there from the apartment of his mistress. Found dead in a compromising situation, the cossacks tried to prevent a scandal and protect the reputation of the general. But Fandorin looks even deeper and finds out that a large sum of money is missing. He learns that Sobolev is trying to raise funds to begin a political campaign, and Fandorin begins to suspect foul play. He finds that the general has been poisoned in a very clever manner, and the killer anticipated the cover up, which would ensure his safe getaway. Fandorin further discovers that the plot leads up to the highest levels of the Tsar's government, and that he himself is now viewed as an enemy of the state for his efforts to catch the killer.
The killer is Achimas Welde, a formidable hired assassin, who has only failed three times in his career. One of those times was his assignment to kill Fandorin, when he just managed to kill Fandorin's wife, as Fandorin himself was chasing him (see "The Winter Queen"). The second half of the novel is told from Achimas' point of view and recounts his life story, up to the plot to kill Sobolev and the investigation. By chance, Achimas discovers that the man who hired him to kill Sobolev was Grand Duke Kirill Alexandrovich, the younger brother of Tsar Alexander III. Apparently, the royal court came to perceive Sobolev as dangerous due to his Napoleonic ambitions, while his immense popularity among the people makes an open trial impossible. In the concluding chapters of the novel, Fandorin kills Achimas, and prepares to flee Moscow (believing himself to be a target of the plotters), but Prince Dolgorukoi's assistant meets him at the train station and tells him that everything has been covered up and he can continue in the service of the state.
Structure.
"The Death of Achilles" is unusual in the sense that the story is told twice; halfway through, the point of view switches from Fandorin to his antagonist, and the latter's life history is told. When the two stories reach the same time, they merge in two final, concluding chapters. This is highly reminiscent of some of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels, such as "A Study in Scarlet" and "The Valley of Fear". The first half of "The Death of Achilles" is also the first Fandorin story since "The Winter Queen" to be told from Fandorin's point of view.
The earlier career of the assassin Achimas Welde includes a confrontation with a rival assassin nicknamed "The Jackal", who intended to assassinate the King of Italy. This is a clear reference to the well-known thriller "The Day of the Jackal", where an assassin of the same nickname comes close to assassinating Charles de Gaulle. Welde's career also includes an episode touching on a Belgian paedophile serial killer, reminiscent of the real-life such affair in Belgium a century later than the time in which the book is set.
Historical context.
The figure of general Sobolev was based upon General Mikhail Skobelev. Skobelev died suddenly of a heart attack in 1882 under the circumstances similar to such as described in the novel (during a meeting with a prostitute). The press reports regarding his demise was heavily censored which gave rise to many conspiracy theories, some implicating the Tsar Alexander III himself.
The governor of Moscow, Prince Dolgorukoi, is based on Prince Vladimir Andreevich Dolgoroukov, the Governor General of Moscow in 1865- 1891. Grand Duke Kirill Alexandrovich, the Tsar's brother, apparently is a fictionalized version of Alexander III's real younger brother, Vladimir Alexandrovich.
Allusions to the "Iliad" and other Greek myths.
As the title of the novel suggests, "The Death of Achilles" alludes to one of the main characters of the "Iliad". However, the allusion is more complex than just the mere reference to general Sobolev's nickname, the Russian Achilles.
In fact, the "true" Achilles referred to in the title is the killer, Achimas Welde. The second part of the novel, which recounts the expert assassin's life story, is a cleverly disguised retelling of the Iliad and other Greek myths relating to the life of Achilles. Some clues are scattered within the novel for the informed reader to decipher, such as the following:
The novel's title, therefore, has a double meaning. The real death of Achilles it refers to occurs not at the beginning but in the end of the book. Sobolev's role in the novel, in spite of his nickname, is that of Hector, Achilles' victim. A funeral speech delivered by the Grand Duke midway through the novel, in which he directly compares Sobolev to Hector, offers a more direct clue.
This is one of the more complex and broad allusions to famous works of literature which are quite numerous in all Akunin's novels.

Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji)

The Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR) began operations in Fiji in 1880 and until it ceased operations in 1973, had a considerable influence on the political and economic life of Fiji. Prior to its expansion to Fiji, the CSR was operating Sugar Refineries in Melbourne and Auckland. The decision to enter into the production of raw sugar and sugar cane plantation was due to the company's desire to shield itself from fluctuations in the price of raw sugar needed to run its refining operations. In May 1880 Fiji's Colonial Secretary John Bates Thurston persuaded the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to extend their operations into Fiji by making available of land to establish plantations.
Mills.
Sugar production had started in Fiji with the collapse of the cotton price in early 1860s. Many small sugar mills were established but these were mismanaged and unprofitable. During the period of low sugar prices in the 1890s, most of these mills closed, leaving only four mills in operation in Fiji at the turn of the century. CSR's first Mill in Fiji started crushing sugar cane in Nausori in 1882. Another mill was built at Viria and crushed from 1886 to 1895. It was closed because it was too small to be viable.
The Chalmers brothers built the Penang Mill in 1880 and sold it to Melbourne Trust Company in 1896. The mill was enlarged with machinery from Mago Island (where a mill had closed in 1895) and the increased crushing capacity together with favourable weather conditions enabled the mill to operate independently. The Penang was closed down in 1922 but reopened in 1925 by the Penang Company. In 1926 it was taken over by the CSR.
Other mills were established in Ba in 1886, in Labasa in 1894 and in Lautoka in 1903. At this stage there was only one other non-CSR mill in operation in Fiji. The Navua sugar mill was built by Stanlake Lee in 1884 and operated under the name of Fiji Sugar Company Limited. The mill never made any profit and relied on CSR for support. The CSR did not buy the mill when it came up for sale in 1905 because it wanted other millers in the colony, so that they could approach the Government jointly over tax concessions. It was bought by the British Columbia Refining Company in 1906 and operated as the Vancouver-Fiji Sugar Company. It still failed to make any profit and was closed in 1923. The Nausori Mill was shut down in 1959 because of low sugar content in the cane supplied to it.
Fijian cane suppliers.
When sugar mills were being set up in Fiji in the 1870s and 1880s it was hoped that Fijians would be the major supplier of cane. Initially cane was grown by Fijians as a tax crop. Each province was assessed for tax and if the value of the crop handed to the Government exceeded the assessment, a refund was paid to the province. In 1884 Fijians produced 8,884 tons of cane which was 12% of the total cane crushed that year. By 1900, cane supplied by Fijians had risen to 15,447 tons but as a proportion to the total this was only 6%. After 1902, when a change in Government policy allowed cash to be paid for tax, cane supplied by Fijians decreased so that by 1914 cane produced by Fijians was negligible.
European contractors.
In 1880, settlers in Rewa had agreed to grow cane for the CSR for 10 shillings a ton. Even with a bonus in 1884 and 1885, planters were unable to earn a living. Many planters wanted to sell their unprofitable land but CSR would not allow this. When the contract expired, CSR was forced to take over these plantations. The CSR acquired more land for growing cane and by 1914 controlled over . There also arrived in Fiji a new set of landholders who either planted cane themselves or leased their land for cane planting.
European tenants.
In 1890, CSR started leasing its estates to plantation managers and others with capital. At this time there was a general belief that cane plantations were economically viable due to improved cultivation methods and CSR tenants generally paid less rent than other contractors. From 1905 the CSR came under increasing pressure, by overseers, to lease its large estates because the overseers wanted a share in the profit of the sugar industry. In 1908, the management of CSR decided to divide its estates into lots and lease them to its overseers because it was noted that relationship between tenants and their labourers were better than between the company overseers and its Indian labourers. By 1914, most of the CSR's cane was bought from these tenants. One negative effect this had on CSR was that while all the experienced overseers had become tenants, it was left with inexperienced overseers, which led to labour troubles.

Connecticut Route 27

Route 27 is a north–south state highway in southeastern Connecticut running for from U.S. Route 1 in Mystic (in the town of Stonington) to Route 184 in Old Mystic (in the town of Groton).
Route description.
Route 27 begins at an intersection with US 1 in the village of Mystic, within the town of Stonington. It begins as Denison Avenue and continues as Greenmanville Avenue. It passes by the Mystic Seaport and Old Mystic Village and then crosses I-95 at exit 90. North of I-95 it becomes Whitehall Avenue then becomes Main Street as it runs through the village of Old Mystic in the town of Groton. Route 27 ends a short distance later at an intersection with Route 184.
Route 27 from the intersection of Jerry Browne Road (milepost 2.13) in Stonington to the Route 184 terminus (milepost 3.21) in Groton is a state designated scenic road. This portion of the route provides a view to the Mystic River, which it closely parallels.
History.
The road along the east bank of the Mystic River, connecting the villages of Mystic and Old Mystic, was a secondary state highway in the 1920s, with designation Highway 344. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, old Highway 344 was renumbered to Route 169. In 1950, a new state highway was established, Route 27, which connected the village of Poquetanuck in the town of Preston (at Route 12), through Ledyard Center, to Burnetts Corner in Groton (at Route 184).
Route 27 was established in 1950, running from Route 12 in Ledyard to Route 184. The old Route 27 followed the path of the Colonel Ledyard Highway. By the following year, Route 27 was extended along old Route 169 via a short overlap with Route 184. As a result of the 1961 Route Reclassification Act, the part of old Route 27 north of Route 184 was deleted in 1963, leading to its current configuration.

Kershope Burn is a burn running in its entirety along the border between England and Scotland.
The river rises, as Clark's Sike, in a marshy area in Kielder Forest Northumberland known as Hobb's Flow, before becoming Kershope Burn after running by Kershopehead, a farmstead in Cumbria.
The river runs into Liddel Water at Kershopefoot, after which Liddel Water marks the boundary between England and Scotland. The final few metres (yards) of the river flow past the hamlet at Kershopefoot and underneath the railway bridge of the former Waverley Line. Between 1862 and 1969 a passenger station variously known as Kershope or Kershope Foot was located here.

Rajputana

Rājputana (), meaning Land of the Rajputs, was a region in the Indian subcontinent that included mainly the entire present-day Indian state of Rajasthan, parts of the neighboring states of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, and adjoining areas of Sindh in modern-day southern Pakistan.
The main settlements to the west of the Aravalli Hills came to be known as "Rajputana", early in the Medieval Period. The name was later adopted by East India Company as the Rajputana Agency for its dependencies in the region of the present-day Indian state of Rājasthān. The Rajputana Agency included 26 Rajput and 2 Jat princely states and two chiefships. This official term remained until its replacement by "Rajasthan" in the constitution of 1949.
Name.
George Thomas ("Military Memories") was the first in 1800, to term this region the "Rajputana Agency". The historian John Keay in his book, "India: A History", stated that the "Rajputana" name was coined by the British, but that the word achieved a retrospective authenticity: in an 1829 translation of Ferishta's history of early Islamic India, John Briggs discarded the phrase "Indian princes", as rendered in Dow's earlier version, and substituted "Rajpoot princes".
The region was previously long known as Gujratra (an early form of "Gujarat"), before it came to be called Rajputana during the medieval period, although the name "Gujratra" itself originated from the Gurjara-Pratiharas.
Geography.
The area of Rajputana is estimated to be 343,328 square km (132,559 square miles) and breaks down into two geographic divisions:
The whole area forms the hill and plateau country between the north Indian plains and the main plateau of peninsular India.
Transition to Rajasthan.
The territory consisted of 23 states, one Sardari, one Jagir and the British district of Ajmer-Mewar. Most of the ruling princes were Rajputs. These were Rajput Kshatriyas from the historical region of Rajputana, who started entering the region in the seventh century. Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Jaipur and Udaipur were the largest states. In 1947, integration of these states took place in various stages, as a result of which the State of Rajasthan came into existence. Some old areas of south-east Rajputana are now a part of Madhya Pradesh and some areas in the south-west are now part of Gujarat.

Waterless printing

Waterless printing is an offset lithographic printing process that eliminates the use of water or the dampening system used in conventional printing. Unlike traditional printing presses, waterless offset presses do not use a dampening solution to clear the press of ink. Proponents of the technology claim efficiency and ecological benefits. 
Method.
Waterless printing employs silicone rubber-coated printing plates and specially formulated inks. Typically, a temperature-control system is integrated.
Waterless offset presses do not use a dampening solution to keep the plate's non-image areas free of ink. These presses function because the plate's non-image areas consist of a layer of silicone that repels ink. A waterless press resembles a conventional offset press, with the absence of a dampening system. A more common design includes a dampening system to allow the press to function conventionally when required. Direct imaging (digital) offset presses are waterless, with no dampening system.
Waterless offset inks have a higher tack and viscosity (thickness) and are stiffer than conventional offset inks. The temperature of the inks must be strictly controlled to maintain the correct viscosity, as the plate surface is designed to repel inks of a specific viscosity. This temperature distinction is achieved by running chilled water through tubing in hollow cores of two or more vibrating rollers which are found inside ink trains on printing presses.
The image surface of a waterless plate is intaglio (recessed), allowing the plate to carry a greater volume of ink than a conventional plate does and allowing extremely high screen rulings, ranging from 300 to well over 800 lpi (lines per inch). Waterless printing yields higher ink densities and a broader color spectrum than conventional offset printing does. Waterless plates used on sheet-fed presses are commonly rated for runs of 100,000 to 200,000 impressions. The plates designed for use on web-offset presses can yield 300,000 to 500,000 impressions.
When a job needs to be run again, the plate can be rehung on the press, and although the register must be created manually, a portion of the preparation is simplified, since the ink-key profiles can have been saved and reloaded. However, it is more common for the original prepress files, the plate-format that the original prepress files used, or the plate-format bitmaps to be saved or RIPped again. The bitmap data can be reloaded via the direct imaging server, re-imaged on the press, and run normally on press. Direct imaging plates are non-photographic, contain no hazardous waste, and can be recycled through normal aluminum-recycling channels.
Advantages.
The advantages of waterless printing include the following:
History.
Waterless printing was originally developed and brought to market by the 3M company under the trade name Driography in the late 1960s. Results with the product, however, were mixed. Several problems were encountered both in the development of suitable inks for this process and more importantly, in the durability of the driography plate. After several years of research and development and many millions of dollars invested, 3M chose not to pursue further development of the product.
In 1972, Toray Industries, a large Japanese company specializing in synthetic materials development and manufacturing, purchased the patents for the driography product from 3M. Related patents were also purchased from the Scott Paper Co., who were working on a similar project.
Toray's experience in working with synthetic materials and advanced polymer compounds allowed them to improve on the original product design. After some five years of research and development, the Toray Waterless Plate was introduced at DRUPA in 1977.
Marketing of the product began in 1978 with the TAP-type positive plate. Because the first plate was based on a positive working format, the product was first marketed in Japan. (The Japanese commercial printing market is about 95% positive working vs. the U. S., which is approximately 5% positive). Cooperative efforts from press, ink and paper manufacturers helped to support the product, and the overall market acceptance was very good.
The first North American demonstration of the waterless process was at Print '80, and with the introduction of the negative (TAN) type plate in 1982 this market could be seriously pursued. Initial acceptance of the waterless printing system in the U.S. was quite slow. There are several reasons for this:
Overview.
The waterless printing process has three main components: the waterless plate, specially formulated waterless inks, and press equipment outfitted with a temperature control system, like Codimag machines.
The Waterless Plate is based on a laminate design. Aluminum is used as the base material. Light-sensitive photopolymer material is bonded to the aluminum and a two-micron coating of silicone rubber is applied to the photopolymer.
Depending upon the type of Toray or Verico plate used, run lengths for the plates range from 150,000 to more than 600,000 impressions. These run lengths are based on use with a #1 or #2 coated paper. The use of more abrasive stocks will significantly reduce maximum run lengths. Toray waterless plates are recyclable and are not differentiated from conventional aluminum plate material in recycling. Toray plates will fit all popular sheet-fed and web presses.
Exposure of the plate is done using conventional vacuum frames and light sources. Exposure times for the plate material is comparable to most conventional plates. Under exposure, IR light, controlled by the film carrier, passes through the silicone layer of the plate and strikes the photo-polymer layer beneath. IR exposure activates the photopolymer, causing a break in the bond between the photopolymer and the silicone layers. The photo reaction is very precise, and the plate easily achieves resolutions as fine as six micro lines, supporting a dot range from .5% to 99.5% at 175 lines per inch.
After exposure, the plate is ready for processing. Processing equipment for the water-less plate is unique to this system, using specialized chemical and mechanical treatment of the plate. The finished plate now has a non-image area composed of ink-repellent silicone. In the image area, the silicone has been removed to expose the ink-receptive photo-polymer material. This design allows the plate to selectively attract and resist ink without the use of any water, etches, or alcohol.
Simple additions can be made to the water-less plate by scratching or scribing the silicone surface to expose the ink-receptive layers beneath. Deletions are made with the application of a liquid silicone solution which is used to replace silicone in any area where it has been removed (either by photo-imaging or by scribing).
The main difference between waterless and conventional inks is in the resins or vehicles that are used. Vehicles for waterless inks are selected for their rheological properties and tend to have higher viscosities than resins used in conventional ink systems.
The theory behind waterless printing is that the silicone material which makes up the non-image area of the plate has a very low surface energy. This material will resist ink provided the ink's viscosity is such that it has a greater affinity for itself than it does for silicone.
One factor that will affect viscosity is temperature. Removing water from the offset process results in a loss of cooling effect on the surface of the plate. This will tend to cause a primary temperature to increase at the plate cylinder due to friction. Because of the higher initial viscosities of the waterless inks, there is also a secondary heat generation in the roller train caused by the friction of milling the ink through the rollers.
This heat is why press temperature control systems are required to allow for the precise control of temperature within the printing unit. The most popular systems use vibrator cooling, in which coolant is pumped through hollow core vibrator rollers in the inker. This type of system has been in use in high-speed web presses for many years. The technology has been refined and is now being applied to sheet-fed equipment as well. Almost all sheet-fed press manufacturers offer hollow core ink vibrators which can then accept the after-market temperature control systems.
The function of the temperature control system is to circulate enough coolant through the roller train to carry away the heat that is generated by the mechanical actions in the printing unit. The Aniflo technology helps stabilize the temperature and has consistent inking, important parameters for process stability.
This type of system is not designed to chill or refrigerate the inker, but merely to maintain its temperature at a constant throughout the press run. By maintaining a constant temperature, the viscosity of the inks can be maintained at their optimum levels.
Proofing for waterless printing is handled directly from the film. Not all analog proofing systems are capable of rending the low dot gain associated with the process. Experienced waterless printers offer highly accurate proofs. Some waterless printers are using carefully calibrated digital proofing systems successfully.

Giuseppe Biava

Giuseppe Biava (born 8 May 1977) is an Italian football coach and former player who played as a centre back. Throughout his career he played for Italian clubs Albinese, AlbinoLeffe, Biellese, Palermo, Genoa, Lazio, and Atalanta; he won a Coppa Italia with Lazio in 2013.
He is currently in charge as assistant coach of Atalanta Under-23.
Club career.
AlbinoLeffe.
A centre back, Biava started his career with the Leffe youth team, before moving to newly promoted Serie D team Albinese in 1995. During his time with Albinese before the 1998 merger with the Leffe to found AlbinoLeffe, Biava achieved a promotion to Serie C2 in 1997. In 1998–99, Biava helped AlbinoLeffe to ensure promotion to Serie C1. After a one-year loan at Serie C2 side Biellese, Biava returned to AlbinoLeffe in 2001, and was part of the team that won the promotion playoffs in 2003, thus ensuring them a Serie B place.
In 2003–04, Biava marked his Serie B debut, and scored the goal which ensured the first AlbinoLeffe victory in the league, a 1–0 win against Fiorentina.
Palermo.
His performances in the league provoked interest from Serie B club Palermo, which signed him during the January 2004 transfer window. Biava immediately gained a place in the regular lineup, forming a defensive line together with Pietro Accardi and leading the "rosanero" back to Serie A after over 30 years.
Biava was confirmed by head coach Francesco Guidolin as a key player during the 2004–05 season, coincidentally his first season in the top flight, which ended with a historical first qualification for Palermo in the UEFA Cup. However, he did not confirm his performances in the following season, where he was mostly featured as backup player. With Guidolin back at the helm of Palermo in 2006–07, Biava regained a more important role in the Palermo squad, returning to play at his usual levels.
During the summer 2007, Biava refused an offer from his childhood team Atalanta, preferring instead to stay at Palermo even though the club management could not ensure him a place as a regular. He successively agreed a contract extension with the "rosanero" until June 2009.
Genoa.
In June 2008 Biava was sold to Genoa for €500,000, with Cesare Bovo moving the opposite way. At Genoa, he quickly established himself as a regular for the "rossoblu". In their 2008–09 Serie A campaign ending in fifth place he partnered with Salvatore Bocchetti and/or Matteo Ferrari. In the first half of 2009–10 season he often partnered with Bocchetti but in January faced competition in new signing Dario Dainelli while the team's coach preferred a 3–5–2 formation with 3 central defenders and 2 wing-backs.
Lazio.
On 1 February 2010, Biava joined Lazio for a transfer fee of €800,000 (including other costs Lazio paid a total of €1.04 million). Along with new signing André Dias, he became the backbone of the Lazio team starting in 11 matches in the second half of the 2009–10 season and helped the club survive the relegation battle.
In the 2010–11 season Biava made 36 appearances, guiding Lazio to a strong 5th-place finish.
In the 2011–12 season, Biava was limited to 31 appearances due to muscle issues.
He made a career-high 43 appearances in all competitions in the 2012–13 season, leading Lazio to the quarter-finals of 2012–13 UEFA Europa League where they were knocked out by Fenerbahçe, and helped Lazio defeat traditional rivals A.S. Roma to win the 2012–13 Coppa Italia.
Biava missed large portions of the first half of the 2013–14 season, but finished the season strongly, making 24 appearances in all competitions.
Atalanta.
On 17 July 2014, Biava signed for home province club Atalanta B.C. as a free agent.
Coaching career.
In 2016, Biava took on his first coaching role as a youth coach at Pontisola. He successively accepted an offer as a youth coach at AlbinoLeffe in 2017. Under his tenure, he led the Under-19 to promotion to Campionato Primavera 2, the second-highest tier in Italian youth football leagues.
On 23 June 2022, AlbinoLeffe announced to have promoted Biava as head coach for the 2022–23 Serie C campaign, with former Giana Erminio boss Raul Bertarelli as his assistant. He was dismissed on 21 February 2023.
On 6 August 2023, Biava was announced as Francesco Modesto's assistant in charge of the inaugural Atalanta Under-23 team for the 2023–24 Serie C season.
Honours.

St. George's Cathedral (Kingston, Ontario)

St. George's Cathedral in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, is the cathedral church of the Anglican Diocese of Ontario.
History.
The original St. George's parish church was a wooden building constructed in 1792 located across from what is now Kingston Market Square, and was the first church built in the Kingston area. John Stuart was the Rector.
The present church building was constructed at another location (King St. at Johnson St.) during the years 1825–1828. Architect William Coverdale enlarged it in 1838–1840 with the addition of a rebuilt steeple and the doric portico 1842.
It was elevated to cathedral status in 1862. In 1891–1894 the transepts, choir and dome were built but shortly thereafter in 1899 the interior was badly damaged by fire. S. George Curry (architect) and Joseph Power performed a complete restoration in 1899–1900.
Worship at the Cathedral.
The Cathedral is currently led by The Very Rev. Douglas Michael (Dean of Ontario/Rector of Kingston, 2022-) and Brad Barbeau (Director of Music, 2020-). The current Bishop of Ontario is the Right Rev. William Grant Cliff (2023-).
Sunday Services: 8am (Holy Eucharist, BCP) &amp; 10:30am (Choral Eucharist, BAS)
Choral Evensong: 1st and 3rd Wednesdays @ 7:00pm
Other weekday service times are available on the Cathedral website.
Association with the Royal Military College.
For many years Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) cadets and other military groups have marched into St. George's for worship on special occasions. 'Copper Sunday', an annual church parade from RMC to St. George's, in which cadets took up a collection of copper coins, was established in 1882 or earlier. A memorial tablet was erected before 1899 to the memory of three officers, graduates of the Royal Military College of Canada, who died while serving in Africa: Huntly Brodie Mackay, Captain Royal Engineers; William Henry Robinson, Captain Royal Engineers; and William Grant Stairs, Captain the Welsh Regiment, but was lost in the 1899 fire and was not replaced.
In 1918, the Royal Military College's Great War Memorial Flag was presented to the rector of St. George's Cathedral, the Very Rev. Dean Starr, honorary chaplain to the college, by the then Commandant, Brig. General C. N. Perreau, C.M.G.. The 18 feet by 24 feet flag hung on the north gallery of the cathedral, until the summer of 1934, when it was removed to the college museum for preservation. 932 Maple leaves represent those graduates who served, and 147 crimson leaves represent those who paid the supreme sacrifice in the Great War.
In a 1942 church parade ceremony, General Hertzberg asked permission of the churchwarden, RMC Professor W.R.P. Bridger to lay up the RMC colours in the cathedral. After the congregation were addressed by the Lord Bishop of Ontario, the cadet battalion marched back to the college.
A virtual tour the Royal Military College of Canada gallery at the Cathedral Church of St. George features stained glass windows of several soldier saints including St. George. The most recent windows—the St. Cecilia window and the St. Margaret window—also in the RMC gallery, were installed in 2002 and 2003 respectively.
Popular culture.
St. George's Cathedral, Kingston was treated fictionally as St. Nicholas's, Salterton, in Robertson Davies's novel "Leaven of Malice".

River Caldew

The River Caldew is a river running through Cumbria in England.
The river rises high up on the northern flanks of Skiddaw, in the Northern Fells area of the English Lake District, and flows in a northerly direction until it joins the River Eden on the north side of the city of Carlisle.
The Cumbria Way follows most of the course of the river, from its early stages in the "Skiddaw Forest" to Carrock Fell and again from Caldbeck through to the centre of Carlisle.
Etymology.
" Probably 'the cold river', from OE 'cald' and OE 'éa' 'river', influenced by OFr 'ewe' 'water'...However, the possibility that this is a Brit.[ish] name meaning 'swift river' from the same root as 'Calder' cannot be ruled out altogether." (OE=Old English, OFr=Old French, Brit.=British language).
Source of river.
The River Caldew's source is high up on Skiddaw, between the summit and Sale How.
Candleseaves Bog is an area of wetland between Skiddaw and Great Calva that contributes to the flow of the river in its early stages.
During the Middle Ages, the common rush ("Juncus effusus") was important for making rushlights. In Cumbria "sedges" and "rushes" were known as " " seaves " ", hence the origin of the name " " Candleseaves " ".
Course of river.
From its source in the "Skiddaw Forest" the river runs east through a valley between Bowscale Fell and Carrock Fell. At Hutton Roof, the river emerges from the dale and turns sharply northwards, a course taking it through the settlements of Hesket Newmarket, Sebergham, Buckabank and Dalston. At Buckabank the river flows over a weir that provides a mill stream to the cotton mill and there is a salmon ladder. Flowing under Hawksdale Bridge at Bridge End and Dalston's two other bridges (Jubilee Bridge and the White Bridge) the river then flows towards Cummersdale where another weir used to exist above the now modernised textile mill.
In 2016 the floodwaters of the swollen river Caldew washed away the eighteenth-century Bell Bridge at Sebergham.
The river enters the suburbs of Carlisle north of Cummersdale flowing over a weir in Denton Holme at the site of a large Victorian mill. The river flows through the city from Denton Holme beneath west walls and then the Caldew skirts around the castle before emptying into the River Eden opposite Stanwix.

Forddy Anderson

Forrest "Forddy" Anderson (March 17, 1919 – October 25, 1999) was an American basketball coach. He was the first coach in NCAA history to take two different teams to the Final Four; Bradley in 1950 and 1954 and Michigan State in 1957.
Early life.
The Gary, Indiana native led his Ralph W. Emerson High to an IHSAA Sectional title in 1937; he was recruited to Stanford University by fellow Indiana native Everett Dean. Anderson was named All-Pacific Coast after the 1940–41 season; after Pearl Harbor was attacked, he joined the US Navy and spent two years at Great Lakes Training Facility, where he played basketball for Tony Hinkle.
Coaching career.
After completing his Stanford degree in 1946, he was hired as the basketball coach at Drake University. Anderson was considered one of the most innovative coaches of his era and served a combined 24 seasons as head men's basketball coach at Drake University (1946–1948), Bradley University (1948–1954), Michigan State University (1954–1965) and Hiram Scott College (1965–1970).
Anderson twice led his Bradley teams to the NCAA Finals (1950 and 1954). His 1950 team also finished as the NIT runner-up.
He moved to Michigan State, where his 1957 Big Ten Champion Michigan State club finished fourth in the NCAA tournament and his 1959 Michigan State team lost in the Elite Eight (regional finals).
He was fired in the spring of 1965, whereupon he was recruited to assist in creating the athletic department at Hiram Scott College. After Hiram Scott closed its doors, he was the head coach of Peru's national team during the 1970–71 FIBA seasons.
He then began a long career as a collegiate scout for the Boston Celtics during the 1980s and 1990s. He was instrumental in many of the Celtics' draft picks during that era.
Personal life.
Forddy Anderson and his wife Constance "Pat" Anderson were the parents of four children, Constance, Barbara, Forrest Jr. (Frosty) and Tracey. Anderson died on October 25, 1999, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, at the age of 80, after suffering from complications due to pneumonia.

Biography.
Ion Muşuc was born on 31 May 1951, in Bilicenii Noi, Sîngerei District. He is the former leader of the Social Democratic Party of Moldova.
In September 2006, Ion Muşuc and his son, Eduard, were accused of fraudulently churning collateral to the tune of 2 million Moldovan lei ($155,836). At that time, the elder Muşuc was the head of the opposition Social Democratic Party and Eduard Muşuc was a member of its leadership and the former director of the successful Internet provider Megadat. Ion Muşuc fled Moldova when the case was made public, while his son was arrested on charges punishable by 10 to 25 years in prison. Bail was set and rescinded several times until in April 2007, the court dismissed the accusation for lack of a substantive basis. Muşuc took his case to the European Court of Human Rights, and in November 2007 was awarded 12,000 euros ($17,590) for moral suffering and legal fees in connection with what the court termed his "illegal detention."
Currently, his party has no seats in the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova.

The Pulse (SiriusXM)

The Pulse is a Sirius XM Radio station that plays music from the 2010s to present-day on channel 5 and Dish Network channel 6005.
The channel debuted on XM Satellite Radio channel 26 and DirecTV channel 818 on April 17, 2006 as Flight 26 in response to demands by former shareholder Clear Channel Communications (who owns the similarly formatted Mix on channel 22), and was programmed by New York City native Mike Abrams. XM agreed that Clear Channel Communications can add commercials to channels which it already provides programming to, such as KISS, Sunny, and Mix. In response, XM changed their slogan from "100% commercial-free music" to "the most commercial-free music channels on satellite radio". In the United States, the newly commercialized channels were moved, whereas they were deleted outright from XM Canada. XM described Flight 26 as "Modern Hits of the 90s &amp; Now," although since it leaned toward Hot AC, the station played no urban music. The music was targeted for the younger adult group, especially for those who were age 16 or older, and the station played music from such artists as John Mayer, Jack Johnson, Green Day, The Fray, Avril Lavigne, Uncle Kracker, Lisa Loeb, P!nk, Colbie Caillat, Counting Crows, and Nickelback. During its tenure as Flight 26, it was XM's second-most-listened-to channel after Top 20 on 20.
On November 12, 2008, during the consolidation of XM and Sirius programming, Flight 26 took The Pulse branding that lived on Sirius channel 9, which aired a 1990s/hot AC hybrid, and that channel number is now The 90s on 9. Also, the new Pulse was added to channel 12 on Sirius Satellite Radio. As a result, the old Pulse ceased operations due to its ranking #9 in the Sirius ratings, and Flight 26 had higher ratings. A number of Flight 26 on-air personalities joined The Pulse and continue broadcasting under The Pulse branding. The Bridge (which became Led Zeppelin Radio for two months) forced its move from channel 12 to channel 33 (replacing SIRIUS Disorder). However, Mediabase reports The Pulse's playlist under X026-FM rather than S012-FM.
The Pulse's imaging was changed to the same voiceover as the old Flight 26 branding rather than carry the old jingles from the old Sirius 9 channel.
Most recently, to encounter sister channel The Blend's overhaul in September 2009, The Pulse dropped most of the 1990s songs that can already be heard on sister channel '90s on 9. The slogan was also changed to "2000s and today."
Every weekend, The Pulse counts down their top 15 current songs as well as the top 15 Pulse songs that week anywhere from 2010 to 2019. Pat Monahan, lead singer of the band Train, also hosts a weekend show, an hour long of new music discovery songs picked by Pat himself.
After the launch of PopRocks, The Pulse further narrowed its playlist dropping most 2000s songs focusing on currents minus the rap playing a more adult top 40 approach focusing on current hits on the mainstream and hot adult contemporary music mixed with hits from 2010 to today. In early 2018, the Pulse renamed their weekend countdown to "Today's Pulse Top 15", which was formerly known as "2000s and Today Top 15 Countdown". This was due to the fact that the station now focused more on 2010s music. By early 2024, the countdown was no longer co-hosted by all the Pulse DJs, and instead it featured only Brady introducing the week's top songs. This change added a more comedic style to the countdown, while previous features (like hits, trivia, and happenings from an earlier focus year) were discontinued entirely.
On November 5, 2021, The Pulse moved from channel 15 to channel 5, replacing '50s on 5. Mosaic took over The Pulse's former slot.

Ducati SportClassic

The Ducati SportClassics are a range of retro styled motorcycles introduced by Ducati at the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show, and put on sale in 2005 for the 2006 model year. The Paul Smart version was made for the 2006 model year only, while the Sport1000 ran from 2006 through the 2009 model years, and the GT1000 ran from the 2007 through 2010 model years.
They were the product of Ducati's design chief Pierre Terblanche, who said the series started with the "Evoluzione" MH900e replica of Mike Hailwood's victorious 1978 Isle of Man TT bike. The different variations are based on similar frames, and powered by the Desmodue air-cooled 90° V-twin Ducati 1000 Dual Spark engine, also called the DS9 engine.
2006–2009 Sport1000.
The Sport1000 took its inspiration from the 1973 Ducati 750 Sport and related 750 Imola Desmo, and had the look of a classic lightweight single-seat cafe racer. It used a two valve 1000DS motor with a wheelbase, trellis tube frame. The suspension used three way adjustable single Sachs rear shocks, and non-adjustable 43 mm Marzocchi front forks. The wheels were wire spoke large section alloy rims with tubed Pirelli Phantom tyres. Borrani were approached to supply the rims, but could not supply the volume, so Excel rims were used. The Sport1000 was available in black with a white stripe, red with a white stripe, or amber with a black stripe.
The 2006 model, known as the monoposto (single seat) had a well gusseted 60 mm section asymmetric swingarm and a single shock, with stacked mufflers on the right side, low clip-on handlebars, and a dry-clutch. In 2007, a variation was made to taller clip-on handlebars, a wet-clutch, and the GT1000's dual-shock swingarm with mufflers on both sides. This change created space for passenger footpegs and a removable rear seat cowl covering a pillion seat was added, prompting the name change to Sport1000 biposto (twin seat).
In 2007, a Sport1000SE was also produced in a limited run of 100, available only in the US, which used the configuration of the 2006 model and a black and gold paint scheme reminiscent of the square-case 1980 Ducati 900SS. This paint scheme was inspired by a custom scheme done to a 2006 model by a US dealer.
2007–2009 Sport1000S.
The 2007 Ducati Sport1000S had the front suspension of the Sport1000, while adding a retro styled fairing like the Paul Smart. The model could be equipped with Ducati original accessory lower fairings to create a late 1960s or early 1970s race bike look. The 1000S followed the Sport1000's change to a dual-shock swing arm and wet clutch, though lower handlebars were required to fit under the fairing. 2007-2008 Monoposto models were available only in red with a white stripe, while in 2008 the paint scheme was changed to black with a white stripe for the Biposto model. The Ducati Sport Classic 1000 Biposto model was also very similar. The bike came in two styles. "Monoposto" or "Biposto" with the main difference being the "monoposto" is a one-seater and the "biposto" being a two-seater, hence the "mono" and "Bi" connotations. Here are some of the numbers gained from Ducati themselves of how many Bipostos were produced: 2007 model year there were black 240 total/ 69 USA, red 253 total/60 USA, yellow 204 total/109 USA, 2008 black 84 total/ 52 USA, red 14 total/ o USA, yellow 0 total/ 0 USA, total for 2007 697 / 238 USA, 2008 98 / 52 USA. Despite there being so few variants made, they were not number tagged (example (1/300, as many limited run motorcycles are) as their low amounts made were not from Ducati themselves limiting the amounts made like the Paul Smart Model, but rather they were not popular at the time to the public, so low demand caused low production numbers. In 2010 Disney released the film Tron Legacy that featured a black 2008 Ducati Sport Classic 1000 Biposto, so the bike gained popularity, but the production of the motorcycles had already been ceased, so the rarity grew from that point on as a valuable collectors item for the sport classic line as a whole.
2006 Paul Smart Limited Edition.
Paul Smart rode the 750 Imola Desmo competition bike to victory in 1972, and the 1974 750 SuperSport was based on that, tank and sidepanels painted silver, fairing painted green and silver with a green frame. The Giugiaro case 900 and 750 SuperSports had the blue and silver paint. The inspiration for Paul Smart LE is based on these bikes. It has multi adjustable Öhlins suspension front and rear, the fairing, steering damper, and a green frame to go with the silver and blue paint on the tank, lower clip-ons, fairing, and side covers. The Paul Smart was limited to 2000 examples worldwide
2007–2010 GT1000.
The Ducati GT1000 used a similar steel tubular trellis frame to the Paul Smart and the Sport1000, and the same Desmodue engine. It was designed with comfort in mind and intended for sport-touring riders. The frame differed from the Sport1000 in the addition of mounting points for twin shocks and side panels. The GT1000 had touring handlebars, mounted on the same front forks as the Sport has clip-ons: non-adjustable 43 mm Marzocchi upside-down forks.
While the rear end had the seventies appearance, the components were more modern. The rear suspension used twin Sachs shocks, adjustable for spring pre-load, mounted on a beefy 60 mm section swingarm. Wide Excel 17 inch chromed steel (36 spoke) rims are laced with thick 4.4 mm spokes to silver painted aluminum alloy hubs, necessitating the use of tube-type tires.
The front brakes of the GT1000 were derived from the other SportClassic models, and had two Brembo floating calipers with 30 and 32 mm diameter thermally insulated pistons. They were semi-floating discs with a diameter of 320 mm and a thickness of 4 mm. The rear brake system consisted of a floating single piston Brembo 34 mm caliper with high friction sintered pads and a 245 mm disc (bigger rear disc for two-up riders).
It had twin exhausts and silencers, and pillion pegs where they belong for riding any distance. The silencers (exhausts) have more of a "Silentium" look and were not designed to resemble the original 'reverse cone' "Conti" silencers that were present on the original 1970s Ducatis that inspired the GT1000.
The GT 1000 Touring was a special edition model with chrome fenders, a small chrome luggage rack, a higher handlebar and a windscreen.

Maintenance release

A maintenance release (also minor release or Maintenance Pack or MP) is a release of a product that does not add new features or content. For instance, in computer software, maintenance releases are typically intended to solve minor problems, typically "bugs" or security issues.
Example of minor version numbering.
The somewhat unusual version number "3.0.5a" was used for a minor release of KDE because of a lack of version numbers. Work on KDE 3.1 had already started and, up to that day, the release coordinator used version numbers such as 3.0.5, 3.0.6 internally in the main CVS repository to mark snapshots of the upcoming 3.1. Then after 3.0.3, a number of important and unexpected bug fixes (starting from 3.0.4) suddenly became necessary, leading to a conflict, because 3.0.5 was at this time already in use. More recent KDE release cycles have tagged pre-release snapshots with large revision numbers, such as 3.1.95, to avoid such conflicts.

1st World Scout Jamboree

The 1st World Scout Jamboree was held from 30 July 1920 to 8 August 1920 and was hosted by the United Kingdom at Kensington Olympia in London. 8,000 Scouts from 34 nations attended the event, which was hosted in a glass-roofed building covering an area of .
It was at this event that Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting, was acclaimed the Chief Scout of the World. The organizing secretary was Major Alexander Gawthrope Wade, MC.
Visiting diplomat Lord Robert Cecil, architect of the League of Nations noted the shared vision of the Jamboree (a "League of Youth") and the League.
Olympia and camping.
The Olympia arena was filled with a foot-(30 cm)-deep layer of earth, which was turfed over, enabling the Scouts to pitch tents within the glass-roofed hall.
However, around 5,000 of the Scouts were encamped at the Old Deer Park in nearby Richmond. The Scouts rotated in and out of Olympia to give them all the opportunity to participate in the events there. The Thames flooded the campsite one night and Scouts had to be evacuated.
Olympia hosted numerous exhibitions, pageants and contests (including tug-of-war) during the Jamboree event. Olympia and Old Deer Park events were open to the public. Attendances were such that entrance was restricted to restrict incidents of crushing.
Oswald Stoll produced a show at the Alhambra Theatre of Variety for visiting scouts.
Chief Scout of the World.
In order to honour Baden-Powell's role as the founder of Scouting, it was suggested by James E. West, the Chief Scout Executive of the Boy Scouts of America that he be awarded the title of Great Indian Chief.
However, during the initiation ceremony, one of the young Scouts shouted out "Long live the Chief Scout of the World", and so it became Baden-Powell's official title within Scouting until his dying day.
No other Scouter has held the title since Baden-Powell.
Opening show.
The event was formally opened by the King's uncle (Prince Arthur Duke of Connaught and Strathearn), and daughter (Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood.
The King, George V, unable to attend the event, sent a message of welcome to the visiting contingents in a message to Baden Powell.
Closing speech.
Baden-Powell gave a closing speech at the end of the Jamboree:
"Brother Scouts. Differences exist between the peoples of the world in thought and sentiment, just as they do in language and physique. The Jamboree has taught us that if we exercise mutual forbearance and give and take, then there is sympathy and harmony. If it be your will, let us go forth fully determined that we will develop among ourselves and our boys that comradeship, through the world wide spirit of the Scout brotherhood, so that we may help to develop peace and happiness in the world and goodwill among men".
Jamborees since 1920.
Many lessons were learnt from the first World Scout Jamboree, including the acknowledgement that an indoor venue was too restrictive for the activities and numbers of Scouts who would attend. It was also realised that above all else, a Jamboree is a means of developing a spirit of comradeship among the boys of many nations and the more that aspect can be stressed, the more successful a Jamboree becomes.
Exhibits.
Amongst the thousands of Scouts, there was also a selection of wild animals at the Jamboree:
Official badge.
There was no official badge for this event; the first badge was made for the 2nd World Scout Jamboree. There was later a placeholder badge made to make the set of reminder badges complete.

Remnant (Seventh-day Adventist belief)

In Seventh-day Adventist theology, there will be an end time remnant of believers who are faithful to God. The remnant church is a visible, historical, organized body characterized by obedience to the commandments of God and the possession of a unique end-time gospel proclamation. Adventists have traditionally equated this "remnant church" with the Seventh-day Adventist denomination.
A distinct but related concept is the eschatological remnant, which will manifest shortly prior to the second coming of Jesus. The "remnant church" is understood to act as a catalyst for the formation of this group. The eschatological remnant will consist of some (but not all) constituents of the present "remnant church", together with a cohort of believers from other (that is, non-Adventist) churches. Only members of the eschatological remnant will be saved through the end-times.
Traditionally, Adventists have also applied the symbol of "Laodicea" to themselves, a self-criticism as being "lukewarm" in the faith (Revelation 3:15–16).
The Adventist doctrine of the end-time remnant is based primarily upon Revelation 12:17, which states:
An estimated 90% of Adventists believe "The Adventist Church has a special mission to proclaim God’s last message to the world", according to estimates of local church leaders in a 2002 worldwide survey.
Official statements.
The doctrine of the remnant is outlined in the 28 fundamental beliefs of the Adventist church, as follows.
Mission statement.
The Mission Statement of the church declares:
Church manual and baptismal vow.
The Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual contains a "summary of doctrinal beliefs" in its appendix that is designed especially for use in the instruction of candidates for baptism. The final point identifies the Adventist church with the "remnant":
The church manual also outlines two alternative baptismal vows for candidates who are entering into church membership. The final question of the traditional longer vow (question 13) asks the candidate:
Following baptism, the new member is presented with a "certificate of baptism and commitment" which contains a similarly worded statement, but expressed as an affirmation rather than a question.
In 2005, an alternative baptismal vow was approved at the General Conference Session. This alternative vow contains three statements of belief, and does not mention the remnant. However, it does still require acceptance of the Fundamental Beliefs. Which version to use is up to the discretion of the parties involved.
History.
In 1849, Joseph Bates asserted the Adventists were the remnant.
Gerhard Hasel was a recognized remnant scholar within Christian circles at large, and wrote on the theme of the remnant throughout the Old Testament.
Traditional position.
The Seventh-day Adventist Church has traditionally identified itself as the end-time "remnant church" described in Revelation 12:17. Two of the identifying marks of the remnant listed in this verse are that they "keep the commandments of God" and have the "testimony of Jesus". It is held that the "commandments of God" refer to the Ten Commandments, which includes the fourth commandment regarding the seventh-day Sabbath. In addition, Revelation 19:10 equates "the testimony of Jesus" to the "Spirit of prophecy", which Adventists believe is a reference to the ministry and writings of Ellen G. White. The Adventist church therefore sees itself as unique in possessing these two identifying marks of the remnant church.
According to the historicist interpretation of Revelation traditionally employed by Adventists, the remnant church emerges after a period of 1,260 years (Revelation 12:6) during which the Papacy reigns over Christendom. This period ended in 1798. The Seventh-day Adventist Church formed shortly afterwards, in the period 1844–1863.
The remnant church has a divine mission which is symbolised in the three angels' messages. This mission is to proclaim the "everlasting gospel" to humanity, to call true believers out of false religion (represented by Babylon) and to prepare the world for the final end-time crisis. Even so, at the present time, the remnant church is a visible institution that is made up of both saved and unsaved individuals (in other words, membership in the Adventist church is not a guarantee of salvation).
Ellen White wrote,
At a time, known technically as the "close of probation", shortly before the second coming of Jesus, humanity will be polarized into two distinct groups. Adventists traditionally have taught that this polarization will occur over the Sabbath commandment. Those who are obedient to God in this final era will make up the "eschatological remnant" which will be saved through the final crisis. The eschatological remnant will have some continuity with the remnant church, in that there will be some Adventists who remain faithful in the crisis. However, it is understood that numerous Adventists will succumb to apostasy, thus departing from the remnant. At the same time, there will be numerous Christian believers from non-Adventist churches who will join the eschatological remnant and receive salvation.
Alternative interpretations.
Adventist scholar Ángel Manuel Rodríguez, who himself supports the traditional Adventist interpretation, has stated: "it is with great concern that some observe a tendency to de-emphasize or ignore this fundamental self-definition". Rodríguez identifies a number of different interpretations of the "remnant" that have gained popularity within contemporary Adventism. He proposes several reasons for the increasing redefinition of the concept, including increased contact with other Christians, the delay of the Parousia, theological education in non-Adventist universities, exposure to post-modern world views, and perceived apostasy in the Adventist church.
Similarly, in 2008, Roy Adams wrote in the "Adventist Review", "Today we hesitate to claim we’re the remnant".
In "The Shaking of Adventism", Anglican Geoffrey Paxton described the mainstream belief as follows:
Wider remnant/remnant message.
In modern times some Adventists have broadened the "remnant" concept to include sincere Christians in other denominations. Such a broadening occurred as early as the publication of "Questions on Doctrine".
Many Adventists who hold a "wider" concept of the remnant nevertheless consider that the Adventist church has a unique place in God's purpose for the end times. "Questions on Doctrine" acknowledged the Adventist church as "the visible organization through which God is proclaiming this last special message to the world". Adventists such as Ross Cole speak of Adventists as possessing the "remnant message". These views focus more on the "message" of the remnant, and not on the Adventist church as an institution.
According to Ron Corson, many "progressive" Adventists believe in "An inclusion of other Christians into the category termed the 'Remnant.'"
Liberal views.
Some Adventists have re-interpreted the remnant concept significantly. Steve Daily rejects the identification of the "remnant" with any institution or denomination, and instead considers it to be an invisible entity. He argues for a "move from an ethnocentric remnant theology to a spirit of religious affirmation which acknowledges that the 'kingdom of God on earth' transcends every religious movement of mankind". Ángel Manuel Rodríguez criticizes Daily's position, claiming that "The level of discontinuity with traditional Adventism is so drastic that it is difficult to incorporate it into any meaningful dialogue."
Others have interpreted the remnant concept along sociological and political lines, for example "Remnant and Republic: Adventist Themes for Personal and Social Ethics", edited by Charles W. Teel Jr. It is argued that the remnant has a duty to work towards social and political reform. Some who espouse these views deny that the remnant is a religious body to be identified with any particular church. Rodriguez again rejects such interpretations, asserting that they set aside "the biblical understanding of the remnant as fundamentally a religious entity".
Criticism of the remnant doctrine.
Progressive Adventist criticism.
The progressive Adventist journals "Spectrum" and "Adventist Today" commonly publish articles and letters which deny this doctrine, instead claiming that the remnant is much wider than the Adventist church. Rodríguez believes that a tendency to reject the remnant concept is related to a tendency to reject the historicist method of interpreting prophecy.
Raymond Cottrell, writing about the challenges of producing the "Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary", claimed that the remnant doctrine is not supported by the traditional prooftexts.
What should an editor do with 'proof texts' that inherently do not prove what is traditionally attributed to them—as, for example... and ... In most of these and a number of other passages, pastoral concern led us to conclude that the "Commentary" was not the place to make an issue of the Bible versus the traditional interpretation, much as this disappointed us as Bible scholars and would be a disappointment to our scholarly friends who know better."
Nathan Brown, then "Record" editor, has written in that magazine, "For many Adventists, the topic of the 'remnant'—and particularly various statements that have sounded like claims to be ""the" remnant church"—has been a source of discomfort, feeling a bit too much like arrogance or at best claims we would all struggle to live up to."
Non-Adventist criticism.
Non-Adventists scholars have disputed the Adventist understanding of the remnant. Calvinist theologian Anthony Hoekema argued that the doctrine of the remnant church is indefensible on both exegetical and theological grounds. Exegetically, the Greek word "remnant" ("leimma") is not found in Revelation 12:17 and thus it is not possible to read a "church within a church" into the verse. The translation "remnant" is an inaccuracy of the KJV upon which the doctrine was originally based. Theologically, Adventists insist that the remnant is merely a visible body within the wider "invisible church;" however there is no biblical or theological warrant for believing in the existence of an "ecclesiola in ecclesia", or "little church within the church". The concept of "remnant" in the New Testament, according to Hoekema, applies only to Jewish believers. Hoekema alleges that the Adventist concept of the remnant resembles the error of schismatic movements such as Montanism, Novatianism and Donatism.
Hoekema finally concludes that the "remnant church" concept places Adventism among the cults, since it implies that the Adventist church is "the last true church left on earth, and all other groups which claim to be churches are not true but false churches." That is, it implies the existence of an "exclusive community", which Hoekema believes is a distinctive trait of the cults. However, because Adventists acknowledge that it is possible for non-Adventist Christians to be saved, Hoekema concedes they manifest the "cultist trait" in a "somewhat ambivalent manner" when compared to religions who teach that salvation "cannot" be found outside their organisations.
Remnant concept in breakaway groups from Adventism.
The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement, which schismed from the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the 1920s, sees itself as the "remnant", the Adventist church represented by the "seed", and other Protestants as the "woman" in Revelation 12:17.

Appleseed (1988 film)

 is a Japanese cyberpunk-style OVA adaptation of the manga of the same name created by Masamune Shirow. The anime takes place in a non-determined future. The anime, produced by Gainax, departs greatly from the manga's storyline, sharing only the characters and setting.
Plot.
After World War III, the General Management Control Office constructs an experimental city known as Olympus. It is inhabited by humans, cyborgs, and bioroids. Bioroids are genetically engineered beings created to serve Mankind. They oversee all the administration duties of Olympus. Olympus was meant to be a utopian society, but for some, it feels more like a cage. Charon Mautholos, an Olympus city police officer, is one of the many who feel that way. Charon secretly conspires with a terrorist, A. J. Sebastian, to destroy Gaia, a super computer that runs the various utilities and networks of Olympus. Out to stop them are Olympus City ESWAT (Enhanced SWAT) team members Deunan Knute and Briareos Hecatonchires. Deunan and Briareos are determined to stop the terrorist plot by any means necessary.
A.J. Sebastian and Charon have plotted to disable Gaia, the computer system which controls Olympus' infrastructure, including the override circuits which safeguard Multi-ped Cannon. To do so, they stage a raid on the facility where bioroids are created, creating havoc by killing and by arson. However, it is discovered that the attack is just a cover for stealing information on one particular bioroid, Hitomi, a friend of Deunan and Briareos, whose DNA is the genetic key which will cause Gaia to shut down. The "locks" are a handful of kiosks, scattered across the city, and the city director orders all but one destroyed, and a heavy guard placed around the one which remains.
Sebastian converts to his full-military configuration and steals Multi-ped Cannon, while Charon—wearing a Cadmos suit which has been made faster through the removal of half the armor—takes Hitomi to the one surviving kiosk. With his faster suit, he is able to get her to the portal, through a hail of gunfire which goes through the decreased armor. As Charon dies, a terrified, confused Hitomi backs into the kiosk, launching the shutdown process. To cover his theft of the Multi-ped Cannon, Sebastian uses the tank and its weapons to cause damage in the city, while the director and Deunan rush to try to restart Gaia, by destroying the circuit module which keeps the system offline. However, Deunan's pistol is damaged and her right (shooting) hand is injured by the databank defense system. The director hands over her own pistol, trusting Deunan's skill more than her own, even with an unfamiliar weapon and shooting left-handed. With her last round of ammunition, Deunan is able to hit the module with pistol fire, and Gaia immediately disables the Multi-ped Cannon. Sebastian is killed, Charon is mourned, and life goes on.
Characters.
Briareos Hecatonchires is a cyborg, mostly human but with enhanced physical strength and an integrated head/helmet, with multiple camera eyes. The most obvious feature is the long sensor antennae which resemble the ears of a rabbit, but which hold such things as a camera eye which allows him to see around corners without exposing himself. They are hinged at the base, and move in response to Briareos' mood. His name is transliterated as "Bularios" in the English dub.
Deunan Knute is a natural human. However, she is skilled in operating her "Guges"-model "Landmate," an exoskeleton-armor powersuit, more powerful and responsive than the standard police-issue "Cadmos" Landmates, and the only type which can take the punishment which she gives.
Charon Mautholos, a natural human like Deunan, is a friend of hers and of Briareos, but he has become disenchanted with life in Olympus following the suicide of his wife, an artist who felt stifled by the pre-programmed environment. Charon becomes bitter, and believes that it is his duty to "free" natural humans from this unnatural environment.
A.J. Sebastian is also a foreign cyborg, with enhanced strength and interchangeable limbs, whose mission is to steal a huge, flying armored tank (called the Multi-ped Cannon) and deliver it to a strike force which flies across the border in support.
Reception.
Chris Beveridge of Mania gave the OVA a mixed review stating "The plot, though simplistic, does work fairly well as a sidestory for the manga." Paul Jacques also from Mania, also gave it a similar review when comparing it to the 2004 film stating, "This original release has slightly better script dialogue (less one liners) than the 2004 version, but lacks the back-story to make you care about anyone. This original version never engaged me emotionally as the 2004 version did: Whereas the 2004 version pulled me in with pathos, this original repels me with judicious swearing and “out of left field” plot twists."
Stig Høgset of "THEM Anime Reviews" heavily criticized the OVA for the changes made from the plot of the manga stating, "It's like they took the deep stories of the manga and tossed them out the window, replacing them with your typical action fare." Michael Poirier of "EX Media", also gave it a negative review stating, "its limited length, crude animation techniques and easy-listening musical score, this animated version of APPLESEED sputters from start to finish." Paul Thomas Chapman of Otaku USA criticized the plot and animation, stating "The animation is laughably limited in places" and "The story isn’t particularly engaging." Helen McCarthy in "500 Essential Anime Movies" stated that although the anime "is showing its age, it's still worth the shelf space." She criticized the English translation, however, and noted that "many of the Greek names are rendered into gibberish rather than English".

River Petteril

The River Petteril is a river running through the English county of Cumbria.
The source of the Petteril is near Penruddock and Motherby, from where the young river runs southeast through Greystoke, Blencow and Newton Reigny, before passing under the M6 motorway, after which the river turns north, and the motorway roughly follows the course of the river towards Carlisle.
Having reached Carlisle, the Petteril runs a course through the south east of Carlisle, dividing the suburbs of Harraby, Upperby and Botcherby, and running alongside the West Coast Main Line for a significant distance, before joining the River Eden on its journey to the Solway Firth. Along its course, the major tributaries of the Petteril include the River North Petteril, Stony Beck, Calthwaite Beck, Blackrack Beck, and Woodside Beck.
The Petteril was in the news in 2022 following a freight train derailment on 19 October, where the railway crosses the river near Carlisle. One cement wagon ended up upside down in the river.

The Gene transfer format (GTF) is a file format used to hold information about gene structure. It is a tab-delimited text format based on the general feature format (GFF), but contains some additional conventions specific to gene information. A significant feature of the GTF that can be validated: given a sequence and a GTF file, one can check that the format is correct. This significantly reduces problems with the interchange of data between groups.
GTF is identical to GFF, version 2.

"Oops (Oh My)" is a song by American singer Tweet from her debut studio album, "Southern Hummingbird" (2002). It features vocals from American rapper Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott, who co-wrote the song with Tweet, while production was handled by Timbaland. The song was released on January 11, 2002, as the album's lead single.
"Oops (Oh My)" was a commercial success in the United States, peaking at number seven on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and topping "Billboard"s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. Additionally, it reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. English electropop band Ladytron covered the song on their 2003 compilation album "Softcore Jukebox".
Writing and composition.
"Oops (Oh My)" is an R&amp;B song featuring a techno-reggae rhythm, built on a loop derived from sampling "Call Me On The Telephone" by Capleton. Although the song is widely considered to be about masturbation, Tweet explained that "[p]eople can take their definition of what any song means to them, but for me, the song wasn't about masturbation—it was about self-love." She said she was inspired to write the song after watching an episode of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" where a doctor advised people to look at themselves in the mirror naked in order to build self-acceptance. She added that it was "empowering" for her to write the song as she "felt like [she] didn't love [herself]" due to her skin color.

Louis Calabro

Louis Calabro (November 1, 1926 – October 21, 1991) was an Italian American orchestral composer.
Biography.
Calabro studied piano and composition at Juilliard School of Music. Vincent Persichetti was his principal teacher there.
Louis Calabro was a music professor at Bennington College of Vermont from 1955 until his death in 1991. He was a composer, teacher, conductor and a percussionist. His students included the American composer Patsy Rogers.
Calabro's original music is published by Elkan-Vogel, Theodore Presser, Tuba Press and Morningstar Music. Calabro has over 100 works to his credit including music for traditional and non-traditional chamber combinations as well as for both large and small orchestral ensembles most notably in America. Calabro believed in writing music for those he knew best and had the distinction of hearing virtually everything he wrote performed during his lifetime. There are many recordings of these performances as well as scores archived at Bennington College and at the University of Vermont.
Louis Calabro founded the Sage City Symphony in 1972, an ambitious community orchestra in southwestern Vermont which is still active and continues to commission new works. Calabro believed strongly in encouraging and promoting contemporary music, at a time when few American orchestras (professional or amateur) were performing premieres. With the Symphony, he commissioned dozens of new orchestral works and conducted their premieres. Composers whose work was premiered under his baton include Marta Ptaszynska and Vivian Fine.
He was a recipient of numerous awards including two Guggenheim Fellowships and two Elizabeth Coolidge Chamber Music Awards, plus grants from the National Endowment on the Arts and the Bicentennial Commission, and the Vermont Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts (1992).

<doc id="6960861" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6960861" title="Remnant (Bible)">
Remnant (Bible)

The remnant is a recurring theme throughout the Hebrew and Christian Bible. The "Anchor Bible Dictionary" describes it as "What is left of a community after it undergoes a catastrophe". The concept has stronger representation in the Hebrew Bible and Christian Old Testament than in the Christian New Testament.
Biblical mentions.
Hebrew Bible.
According to the Book of Isaiah, the "remnant" () is a small group of Israelites who will survive the invasion of the Assyrian army under Tiglath-Pileser III (). The remnant is promised that they will one day be brought back to the Promised Land by Yahweh (). Isaiah again uses the terminology during Sennacherib's siege of Jerusalem ().
The concept of the remnant is taken up by several other prophets, including Amos, Micah, Jeremiah and Zephaniah. In Jeremiah 39–40, the "poor people, who had nothing", who remained in Judah when the rest of its population were deported to Babylon, are referred to as a "remnant". The post-exilic biblical literature (Ezra–Nehemiah, Haggai and Zechariah) consistently refers to the Jews who have returned from the Babylonian captivity as the remnant.
New Testament.
New Testament verses which refer to a faithful "remnant" () include , where Paul refers back to Old Testament examples, and ("And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ").
Church views.
Church of England.
The influential Anglican "remnant theology" of Martin Thornton (1915–1986) sees the church parish as made up of three different levels of members. Thornton refers to the smallest of the groups as the Remnant, likening it to the remnant of Isaiah in the Old Testament. These are ordinary people of extraordinary devotion, more proficient than spiritually gifted, whom it is vital for the parish priest to identify and nurture through spiritual direction, for they are the dependable, beating, praying heart of the parish. They truly live their Christianity and form the core not just of the parish but of the universal "Church Militant".
Roman Catholic Church.
The Old Testament notion of "the remnant" was one of the three images Karl Rahner used to set the parish into his larger vision of church in his 1956 essay "Theology of the Parish" and his 1961 book "The Episcopate and the Primacy", co-authored with then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI). What was significant for Rahner in the concept of "the remnant" was the idea that the whole – the universal Church – could be present in the part – the parish: "the Church as a whole, when it becomes "Event" in the full sense, is also necessarily a local Church, the whole Church becomes tangible in the local Church".
Seventh-day Adventist Church.
The Seventh-day Adventist Church places significant emphasis on the remnant theme, based on a traditional interpretation of the King James Version of . Two of its official belief statements mention the remnant theme: number 13, "Remnant and Its Mission" describes an eschatological (end-time) remnant, and number 18, "The Gift of Prophecy" mentions the spiritual gift of prophecy "is an identifying mark of the remnant church".
Criticism.
James Watts claims that some authors have given too much emphasis to the remnant theme, such as some scholars who "have considered it central to the NT message". According to Watts, there are fewer occurrences of the theme in the Bible than one might expect.

Pascal Collasse

Pascal Collasse (or Colasse) (22 January 1649 (baptised) – 17 July 1709) was a French composer of the Baroque era. Born in Rheims, Collasse became a disciple of Jean-Baptiste Lully during the latter's domination of the French operatic stage. When Lully died in 1687 leaving his tragédie en musique "Achille et Polyxène" unfinished, Collasse completed the last four acts of the score. He went on to produce around a dozen operas and ballets, as well as sacred music, including settings of the "Cantiques spirituels" of Jean Racine. His plan to establish his own opera house in Lille ended in failure when the theatre burnt down. He dabbled in alchemy with even less success. His musical style is close to that of Lully.

Catherine Feeny

Catherine Feeny (born 1976) is an American singer-songwriter based in Portland, Oregon.
She grew up in Norristown, Pennsylvania, studied in Washington, D.C., and relocated to Los Angeles, where she started seriously writing her own songs. Her first album 'Catherine Feeny' was produced by fellow singer-songwriter Joe Purdy and was released in the UK in January 2003. Shortly after, she met producer Sebastian Rogers, who then produced her second album "Hurricane Glass", which was released in the UK in June 2006. It includes the single "Mr Blue" which features in the films "Running with Scissors" (2006) and "Miss Conception" (2008), as well as in the final scene of the series finale of the adult animated series "BoJack Horseman" in 2020.
She originally released "Hurricane Glass" on her manager's Tallgrass Records before signing to EMI in 2007. She is published by Warner-Chappell.
Feeny lived in Norwich for several years before moving in 2008 to Oregon, where she released her third album, entitled "People in the Hole". The title track and only single from the album was featured in U.S. television series "Mercy" and "One Tree Hill".
After moving to Oregon, Feeny and producer Sebastian Rogers married, and formed the band Come Gather Round Us with Jon Neufeld (Black Prairie) and Mike Danner. The band released two folk albums, "Remember Where You Are" and "Despair?".
Feeny and Rogers went to New York in October 2011 to participate in the Occupy Wall Street protests and slept in Zuccotti Park until they and other protesters were arrested and forcibly removed on November 15. This experience was the catalyst for Feeny's fourth album, "America", which was recorded in Portland, Oregon, at Bungalow 9 with musicians Matt Carson, Nate Crockett (Horsefeathers), and Daniel Dixon (Greylag), and producer Sebastian Rogers.
While at Occupy Wall Street, Feeny met playwright and activist Eve Ensler ("Vagina Monologues"). After hearing Feeny's Occupy-inspired anthem "United", Ensler commissioned her to write a song for her international organization One Billion Rising, which focuses on ending violence against women.
She has toured with Hal, Aberfeldy, Martha Wainwright, Dr. John, John Prine, Suzanne Vega, and The Hotel Cafe Tour. She has accompanied Kelly Jones of the Stereophonics on the "Only The Names Have Been Changed" tour.
Feeny says she is influenced by the likes of Joni Mitchell, The Smiths, Ani Difranco, PJ Harvey, The Cure and Sinéad O'Connor.
History.
Before embarking on her solo career, she played in several bands as an adolescent, including LAMPshADE;, among others.

Jim Molinari

James R. Molinari (born December 26, 1954) is an American basketball coach. Molinari is an assistant coach at Boston College. Prior to his stint at Boston College, Molinari was an assistant coach at Oklahoma from 2019 to 2021. He formerly served as an assistant coach at Nebraska and as former head coach of the Western Illinois University Leathernecks, where he served from 2008 to 2014. Prior to being named coach at WIU, Molinari was as assistant coach at Ball State University after serving as the interim head coach at the University of Minnesota, replacing Dan Monson on November 30, 2006, and being succeeded by Tubby Smith on March 22, 2007. Previously, he served as head men's basketball coach at Northern Illinois University and Bradley University. He also was a scout for the Toronto Raptors and Miami Heat.
Molinari graduated from Glenbard West High School, where he starred on its varsity boys' basketball team. He first attended Kansas State University from 1973 to 1975, lettering twice with Jack Hartman's Wildcats. A 6'1" (1.85 meters) guard who wore uniform number 30, he appeared in 22 games, including a 95–87 defeat to Syracuse in the NCAA East Regional Final at the Providence Civic Center on March 22, 1975. He transferred to Illinois Wesleyan University for his last two undergraduate years. A reserve who averaged 9.1 points per game, he was a teammate of Jack Sikma in both seasons. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1977.
Molinari graduated from the DePaul University College of Law, earning his juris doctor in 1980. He passed the Bar Exam. Molinari spent eleven seasons as an assistant coach for both Ray and Joey Meyer at DePaul University.
His first head coaching assignment began on April 28, 1989, when he replaced Jim Rosborough at Northern Illinois University (NIU). A combined 42–17 in his two seasons at NIU, the Huskies finished the 1990–91 campaign with the second-best team defense in the nation which allowed 57.5 points a game, a program-best 25–6 record and an at-large bid to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.
He succeeded Stan Albeck in a similar capacity at Bradley University on April 12, 1991. He inherited a program which had at least 20 losses in each of the previous two years. After going a combined 18–39 in Molinari's first two seasons at Bradley, the Braves had at least 20 wins in each of the three subsequent years. His most successful campaign was 1995–96 when he was named the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) Coach of the Year and the Braves earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. He had a 174–152 record in eleven seasons at Bradley which also included five National Invitation Tournament (NIT) appearances in 1994, 1995, 1997, 1999 and 2001. Despite having the longest tenure among MVC men's basketball head coaches at the time, he was fired on March 5, 2002, after a 9–20 finish. The dismissal was driven by David Broski's dissatisfaction over the Braves' 42–48 record during the three years he had been university president at that point. Molinari was replaced by Jim Les a month later on April 7.

Michael Milenski

Victor Michael Milenski (born 1941) founded the Long Beach Opera in 1979, and was its general director for 25 seasons, retiring in 2004. Though local opera companies had been organized in the 1920s and 1960s in metropolitan Los Angeles, under Milenski’s direction the Long Beach Opera became the first professional opera company to take root in the modern era and survive. Having predated the formation of Los Angeles Opera and Orange County's Opera Pacific, Long Beach Opera is the Los Angeles area's oldest standing professional opera company.
Milenski was born in Cortez, Colorado, United States. A music graduate of the University of Colorado, he abandoned his doctoral work in Italian Studies at UC Berkeley to join the San Francisco Opera's Merola Training Program in the early 1970s. Rising through the ranks of the company's technical and production departments, he was tapped by the San Jose Symphony to produce Bizet's "Carmen" in the 1977–78 season and Verdi's "La Traviata" the following season.
In the meantime, the management of the Long Beach Symphony invited Milenski to mount his "Traviata" production under the aegis of Long Beach Grand Opera in March, 1979. With the success of that venture, Milenski quickly established the company independent of the Symphony and undertook a trial period of presenting standard operatic repertoire.
In the early 1980s, Milenski became more widely known to the American opera community for introducing revisionist and deconstructive opera productions into the United States, and for exploring repertory outside mainstream American operatic offerings. His 1983–84 productions of Britten's "Death in Venice" and Monteverdi's "Coronation of Poppea" starring Catherine Malfitano established the Long Beach Opera as a maverick presenter of alternative artistic vision.
As a producer, Milenski was an iconoclast, remaining apart from the American operatic establishment. Los Angeles Philharmonic executive director Ernest Fleischmann noted that Milenski established a benchmark for progressive programming and daring production that invigorated the entire Southern California performing arts community.
Among his operatic legacies, Milenski stimulated the careers of stage directors Christopher Alden and Julian Webber, and he gave his daughter Isabel Milenski her directorial debut with Peri’s "Euridice" in a 2001 production at the Getty Museum commemorating the 400th anniversary of the “first” opera.
Michael Milenski has been a proponent of composer Gian Carlo Menotti's opera The Saint Of Bleecker Street

Katherine Healy

Katherine Healy (born January 26, 1969) is an American former principal ballerina and actress who also had a professional performing career in figure skating.
Biography.
Healy was born in New York City. Between the ages two and four, she began training in ice skating and then ballet.
She was inspired to take ballet lessons after seeing the Rudolph Nureyev film "`I Am a Dancer".
At age six, she made her debut as the protege of 1976 Olympic champion John Curry in a Madison Square Garden exhibition called "Superskates."
She was the subject of the photographer Jill Krementz book "A Very Young Skater", published in 1979.
She never competed at an elite level in figure skating; instead, she turned professional figure skater at 10 years old.
Healy attended high school in Brooklyn Heights. Her favorite subjects were Latin, Chinese, and French literature. Due to missing school while performing, she was allowed to mail in her assignments.
Healy's true career aspiration, however, was not to be a figure skater, but to pursue a career as professional ballet dancer. She trained in George Balanchine's School of American Ballet for five years. She performed the character of Marie (more often known as Clara) in the New York City Ballet's production of "The Nutcracker" in 1978 and 1979.
In 1982, Healy had a major role in the film "Six Weeks", with Mary Tyler Moore and Dudley Moore, portraying a young ballet dancer with terminal leukemia.
She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for this role in the category "Best New Star – Actress".
Shortly afterwards, Healy concentrated more exclusively on ballet. After having won the silver medal in the junior division at the 1982 USA International Ballet Competition, the following year she won the same event in Varna, Bulgaria, becoming the youngest ever to be awarded the gold medal. In 1984, at the age of 15, she joined the London Festival Ballet (now the English National Ballet) as a senior principal dancer, and performed with that company for two seasons. During her time in England, she performed roles such as Swanilda in Coppélia, and the principal roles in "Etudes", " The Nutcracker", Balanchine's Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux and the "Don Quixote" Pas de Deux. At the age of sixteen, Sir Frederick Ashton chose and personally coached her for the role of Juliet in the revival of his production of "Romeo and Juliet". She performed Juliet in the premiere of this production in London in July, 1985, at a royal gala attended by Princess Margaret.
After returning to the United States in 1986, she entered Princeton University. She graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University in 1990 with a degree in art history. She was also the recipient of the Senior Thesis Prize in the Department of Art and Archaeology for her thesis on French Impressionism. During her time at Princeton, she continued her ballet training with Wilhelm Burmann, who remained her private ballet coach for the rest of her dancing career. Also during her college years, she performed as a guest artist in Japan, Canada and with several local companies in the New York area such as the Eglevsky Ballet, Connecticut Ballet and New Jersey Ballet. She performed the title role of "Cinderella", Odette in "Swan Lake" (Act II) and the lead role in Balanchine's "Allegro Brillante" for the Eglevsky Ballet, the role of Swanilda in Brett Raphael's production of "Coppélia" for the Connecticut Ballet and Odette in "Swan Lake" (Act II) for the New Jersey Ballet (partnered by Leonid Kozlov). In addition, during her time at university, she trained again with John Curry and made occasional skating appearances. Among these were televised appearances in An Evening With Champions (PBS), Symphony of Sports (ABC Wide World of Sports) and Happy New Year USA (PBS), where she performed a solo La Rose du Bal and was partnered by John Curry in an ensemble waltz from Tchaikovsky's music for "Eugene Onegin", choreographed by Tim Murphy.
In 1989, Healy performed in the cabaret-style ice show “Star Spangled Ice,” in Blue Jay, California. The show also featured Robin Cousins, the 1980 Olympic champion. The show benefited the International Foundation for the Advancement of Ice Skating.
Following her graduation from Princeton, she worked as a principal ballerina with Les Ballets de Monte Carlo and the Vienna State Opera Ballet. In Monte Carlo, she danced (among other roles) the leading roles in George Balanchine's Theme and Variations, Tarantella, Rubies and Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux as well as in Antony Tudor's ballet Gala Performance. Roland Petit created a principal role for her in Mozart et la Danse in 1991. In Vienna, her roles included (among other roles) Lise in "La Fille Mal Gardée", Kitri in "Don Quixote", Juliet in John Cranko's production of "Romeo and Juliet", the title roles in "Giselle" and in Sir Kenneth MacMillan's production of "Manon", as well as the title role of Raymonda in revived excerpts of Rudolf Nureyev's production of "Raymonda". She also performed leading roles in John Neumeier's production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream", Hans von Manen's Letzte Lieder, George Balanchine's Serenade, Apollo and Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux and the principal role of Masha (i.e. Marie, or Clara) in Yuri Grigorovich's production of "The Nutcracker". She was featured in the Vienna Philharmonic's New Year's Day Concert on PBS with Walter Cronkite in 1993, 1994 and 1996 on worldwide broadcasts. Her appearance in 1996 was in a piece choreographed especially for her by Heinz Spoerli. She returned to the United States in 1997, where she resumed her skating career.
In addition to her work with Curry, Healy was coached as a skater by Glyn Watts and Richard Callaghan, and passed the United States Figure Skating Association's gold-level ice dancing test.
She taught on the faculty of the Valentina Kozlova Dance Conservatory of New York (New York City) until June, 2008. In January 2008, she won the Outstanding Choreography Award at the Dance Educators of America Semi-Final Competition in New York City for the ensemble piece "Por Una Cabeza" she choreographed for the advanced students at VKDCNY. She currently is on the faculty of the American Theater Dance Workshop in New Hyde Park, New York and also taught at Connecticut Ballet (Stamford, Connecticut), in addition to her skating school affiliations.
She was married to World and Olympic figure skating coach Peter Burrows for 17 years. She was widowed on April 9, 2014, when he died at the age of 75. She worked as a skating coach and choreographer in Monsey, New York and in New Hyde Park, New York. She was a regular performer and choreographer for the Ice Theatre of New York until 2005. Ice Theatre commissioned two original works from her and she restaged Jean Pierre Bonnefoux's work Ice Moves for the company. She has also appeared in shows such as An Evening with Champions, the Equal Challenge of Champions and the Vail Figure Skating Festival.

Differences (song)

"Differences" is an R&amp;B song by American singer Ginuwine. It was written by the artist alongside producer Troy Oliver and recorded for his third studio album, "The Life" (2001). Released as the album's second single, the ballad spent four weeks at number-one on the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and peaked at number four on the "Billboard" Hot 100. It was ranked at number 50 and number 68 in the 2001 and 2002 on "Billboard" Year-End lists, respectively, and was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). American rapper Pop Smoke sampled the song on his hit track released in 2020, "What You Know Bout Love" from his album "Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon".
Background.
"Differences" was written by Ginuwine along with Troy Oliver, while production was helmed by the latter. In an interview with "Blogcritics", Ginuwine commented on the background to the track: "That song was really during a time when I was going through a depressed state because of my dad and my mom had passed. We're writing a whole bunch of songs [...] I said, 'I'm going to write a song about [my wife]', and it happened to be a song that a lot of people wanted to sing to their wives when they were getting married. It's just one of those songs that will always be here. I'm just happy I'm the one that did it."
Chart performance.
Released as the second single from "The Life", "Differences" peaked at number one on the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the week ending October 6, 2001, becoming his second single to do so. A precedent on the chart, it became the first track on the chart to reach the summit without a physical single being available at retail in a configuration.
Music video.
A music video for "Differences" was directed by Hype Williams. A special effects-heavy clip, Ginuwine elaborated on the video shooting in an interview with MTV News: "Actually, the game plan going into [the shoot] was [to] talk to God. Williams was like, 'Look man this gotta be heartfelt. People gotta know you mean this.' He was saying, 'The only way they're gonna know you're meaning it is if you close your eyes and you just talk to God.' I was very skeptical about it 'cause I was just [in front of] a green screen all day. I just had to imagine – he was just telling me what is gonna be where."

Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist (Saskatoon)

The Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, located at 816 Spadina Crescent East in the Central Business District neighbourhood of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada is the cathedral of the Anglican Diocese of Saskatoon.
History.
Although Saskatoon was founded in 1883, St. John's, its first Anglican parish, was not established until 1902 owing to the substantially Methodist and to a lesser extent Presbyterian character of the early settlement, it having been founded as a temperance colony. The first St. John's church, a wooden frame building, was erected in 1903. The present building used was built from 1912 to 17.
St. John's was designated a pro-cathedral in 1924 while Saskatoon remained part of the Anglican Diocese of Saskatchewan with its cathedral in Prince Albert. In 1932 the Diocese of Saskatoon was created and St. John's became its cathedral. The cathedral had only a small reed organ and piano by way of musical instruments until 1956 when a three-manual Hill, Norman and Beard organ was built; it was replaced by a two-manual Casavant Frères organ in 1981-1982.
Architecture.
The present brick, Tyndall stone and terra cotta structure was raised in an unornamented neo-Gothic style. Its chief distinguishing characteristic is a rood screen at the chancel steps. The rood screen, pulpit, lectern, and high altar are made of Carrara ware (Doulton white terra cotta resembling Italian Carrera marble). The cornerstone was laid in 1912 by the Governor General of Canada, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught. The building's foundation is made of fieldstone (which includes granite, gabbro, diorite, gneiss, schist, and dolomite).
The nave is 40×14m in size; it together with the transepts originally sat 1100. The seating capacity has been reduced to 800 with the removal of pews at the liturgical west end and to accommodate a nave altar at the crossing. Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh have worshipped at St. John's three times (1951, 1959, 1987), and Governor General Viscount Alexander worshipped there in 1948.

Canadian Chamber Choir

The Canadian Chamber Choir (Choeur de chambre du Canada)'s mission is to build community through choral singing. The CCC is a national ensemble that provides a professional choral environment for Canadian singers, conductors and composers, and travels across Canada promoting Canadian choral music. Under the artistic direction of Julia Davids, the CCC convenes in different regions of Canada twice a year, offering concerts and mentoring choral practitioners of all ages and stages.
Projects.
The CCC puts on two or three projects each year. Each project brings together 17 singers, an artistic director, and an accompanist from across Canada. Projects are usually seven to ten days in length and are put on in different regions in Canada. Singers will have received their music in the mail and learned it prior to arrival at the project. Upon arrival in the host city, they spend three to four days in rehearsal, hosted by a local school, choir, or community group. The CCC then travels to a few nearby towns on a tour, giving a combination of concerts and workshops throughout the province. Education is at the heart of the mandate of the CCC, and this model allows for an increasing number of communities and singers to have access to high caliber choral music.
Projects could not be carried out if not for the generous support of sponsors. The Canadian Chamber Choir is a registered charity.
History.
The CCC was formed in July 1999 by a group of Canadian musicians. The purpose of the choir was to provide professional choral opportunities to young musicians that lived in areas of Canada that were unable to support professional choirs. Their mandate was to organize and perform short intensive 'projects' two or three times each year.
The original artistic director was Montreal conductor, Iwan Edwards. In 2004, Julia Davids took over artistic responsibilities. Under Davids' leadership, the choir focuses on developing the choral art through education and outreach initiatives, in addition to striving for artistic excellence.

Don't Just Lie There, Say Something!

Don't Just Lie There, Say Something! is a 1974 British comedy film directed by Bob Kellett and starring Brian Rix, Leslie Phillips, Joan Sims and Joanna Lumley. It was based on the Whitehall farce of the same title written by Michael Pertwee, who also wrote the screenplay. A government minister and his best friend take action in parliament against permissive behaviour in the United Kingdom.
Plot summary.
Sir William Mainwaring-Brown, a British Government Minister, puts forward a parliamentary Bill to battle "filth" (permissive behaviour) in the UK. However, that does not stop him having an affair with Wendy, the wife of a high-up reporter, as well as planning a one-night-stand with his secretary Miss Parkyn. Opponents of the Bill, mainly some hippies, led by Johnny, decide to kidnap the Minister's best friend and co-sponsor of the Bill, Barry Ovis, just as he is on the way to the church to marry his fiancée, Jean.
The intention is to discredit Barry Ovis by making it appear that he was involved in an orgy, thus removing any credibility that the Law and Order Bill might have had. Following a tip-off by Edith, one of the conspirators, the police raid the hippies' flat. Barry escapes before the police discover him and dashes back to Sir William's flat, followed by Edith.
Meanwhile, the Minister is also trying to use the flat to carry on his seduction of Miss Parkyn, only for Wendy to also appear by surprise. The Minister, Barry and Jean try to keep the truth from Inspector Ruff, who is searching for the missing Ovis, Wilfred Potts (an elderly anti-sleaze MP, who is staying temporarily in the adjoining flat) and Birdie (the Minister's wife). Not only that, but they have to try to deal with the hippies who do their utmost to discredit Mainwaring-Brown and Ovis. Naturally this causes no end of trouble.
Original play.
The film was based on a play by Michael Pertwee which debuted in 1971 starring Brian Rix.
Production.
According to Brian Rix, Edward Dryhurst approached him in 1972 wanting to make a film version, claiming there was finance from Rank. Pertwee wrote a script based on his play. It turned out Dryhurst did not have finance so Rix and Pertwee approached producer Andrew Mitchell who along with director Bob Kellett raised the money from the Rank Organisation. The low budget meant the film had to be made on location, including Kellett's office. Rix wrote " It was chaos, but by cool management on the part of Andrew Mitchell and even cooler direction by Bob Kellett, a very passable film was made."
The Rank Organisation financed four films by the end of the 1974 financial year,"Carry on Dick", "Carry on Girls", "The Belstone Fox" and "Don't Just Lie There, Say Something", and partly financed "Soft Beds and Hard Battles" and "Caravan to Vaccares".
Reception.
According to Rix the film was very successful in South Africa.
Critical reception.
"The Monthly Film Bulletin" wrote: "As a film, "Don't Just Lie There" is so unexceptionally mediocre as to be beneath constructive comment: a straight, dead celluloid rendering of the stage play, seventy-five percent of which has been shot in a single, three-room set. Brian Rix and Leslie Phillips project their decades-old personae, and the script manages with like somegenius to strike not a single underivative note as it treads through all the standard, degrading gags about falling trousers and rampant desire. The latter, of course, is never consummated – Phillips, middle-aged roué, apparently a great success with the ladies, runs in blind terror to his deodorants when his conquest begins to undress. It is only too ironic that writer Michael Pertwee should have chosen – in a vain and wholly misdirected attempt at topical allusion – to make his farce-hypocrites into politicians running a campaign against pornography. The pornographer, in Lawrence's phrase, does dirt on sex; the writer of dirty comedies, in his own way, does much the same thing."
"Halliwell's Film Guide" wrote: "stupefying from-the-stalls rendering of a successful stage farce; in this form it simply doesn't work".
"Radio Times" stated that the film "reduces the precise timing of the double entendres, the bedroom entrances and exits and the dropped-trouser misunderstandings to the level of clumsy contrivance, which not even the slickest of players can redeem".
Television spin-off.
The film was spun off into a sitcom, "Men of Affairs," for ITV. The Leslie Phillips role went to Warren Mitchell.

River Lyvennet

The River Lyvennet is a river flowing through the county of Cumbria in England.
The source of the Lyvennet (as Lyvennet Beck) is close to Robin Hood's Grave on Crosby Ravensworth Moor, an area rich in ancient remains. From there, the beck flows northwards through Crosby Ravensworth, Maulds Meaburn and King's Meaburn, emerging as the River Lyvennet. The river is joined by the River Leith shortly before the Lyvennet's own confluence with the River Eden. It is long and has a catchment area of .
The Environment Agency, Natural England and the Eden Rivers Trust have partnered to, over the course of two years, restore bends and turns to parts of the river that had previously been straightened for land management purposes. This can help prevent flooding and has encouraged Atlantic salmon to return to spawn. Volunteers planted 10,000 wildflowers of over 30 native species on the surrounding land.
The river is also home to brown trout.
Several Pedigree cattle herds are named after the river, including Lyvennet Simmentals of Greystone House, King's Meaburn.
The Lyvennet valley may preserve the name of Taliesin's "Llwyfenydd" and would thus be associated with the post-Roman Brythonic kingdom of Rheged. The meaning of the Welsh word "llwyfen" is the elm tree.

Moose Solters

Julius Joseph "Moose" Solters (born Julius Joseph Soltesz; March 22, 1906 – September 28, 1975) was an American professional baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball between 1934 and 1943.
Career.
Solters played nine seasons in the American League, for four different teams; the Boston Red Sox (125 games), St. Louis Browns (319 games), Cleveland Indians (260 games), and Chicago White Sox (234 games). During his major league career, he appeared in a total of 938 games, batting .289 with 83 home runs and 599 RBIs. He hit for the cycle on August 19, 1934, while with the Red Sox.
On August 2, 1941, while playing for Chicago at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C., Solters was struck by an errant baseball during a pregame warmup. The thrown ball fractured his skull and has been attributed to his going blind two years later. Solters died in 1975 in his hometown of Pittsburgh, and is buried in Calvary Cemetery there.

Transform, clipping, and lighting

Transform, clipping, and lighting (T&amp;L or TCL) is a term used in computer graphics.
Overview.
Transformation is the task of producing a two-dimensional view of a three-dimensional scene. Clipping means only drawing the parts of the scene that will be present in the picture after rendering is completed. Lighting is the task of altering the colour of the various surfaces of the scene on the basis of lighting information.
Hardware.
Hardware T&amp;L had been used by arcade game system boards since 1993, and by home video game consoles since the Sega Genesis's Virtua Processor (SVP), Sega Saturn's SCU-DSP and Sony PlayStation's GTE in 1994 and the Nintendo 64's RSP in 1996, though it wasn't traditional hardware T&amp;L, but still software T&amp;L running on a coprocessor instead of the main CPU, and could be used for rudimentary programmable pixel and vertex shaders as well. More traditional hardware T&amp;L would appear on consoles with the GameCube and Xbox in 2001 (the PS2 still using a vector coprocessor for T&amp;L). Personal computers implemented T&amp;L in software until 1999, as it was believed faster CPUs would be able to keep pace with demands for ever more realistic rendering. However, 3D computer games of the time were producing increasingly complex scenes and detailed lighting effects much faster than the increase of CPU processing power.
Nvidia's GeForce 256 was released in late 1999 and introduced hardware support for T&amp;L to the consumer PC graphics card market. It had faster vertex processing not only due to the T&amp;L hardware, but also because of a cache that avoided having to process the same vertex twice in certain situations. While DirectX 7.0 (particularly Direct3D 7) was the first release of that API to support hardware T&amp;L, OpenGL had supported it much longer and was typically the purview of older professionally oriented 3D accelerators which were designed for computer-aided design (CAD) instead of games. 
Aladdin's ArtX integrated graphics chipset also featured T&amp;L hardware, being released in November 1999 as part of the Aladdin VII motherboards for socket 7 platform. 
S3 Graphics launched the Savage 2000 accelerator in late 1999, shortly after GeForce 256, but S3 never developed working Direct3D 7.0 drivers that would have enabled hardware T&amp;L support.
Usefulness.
Hardware T&amp;L did not have broad application support in games at the time (mainly due to Direct3D games transforming their geometry on the CPU and not being allowed to use indexed geometries), so critics contended that it had little real-world value. Initially, it was only somewhat beneficial in a few OpenGL-based 3D first-person shooter titles of the time, most notably "Quake III Arena". 3dfx and other competing graphics card companies contended that a fast CPU would make up for the lack of a T&amp;L unit. 
ATI's initial response to GeForce 256 was the dual-chip Rage Fury MAXX. By using two Rage 128 chips, each rendering an alternate frame, the card was able to somewhat approach the performance of SDR memory GeForce 256 cards, but the GeForce 256 DDR still retained the top speed. ATI was developing their own GPU at the time known as the Radeon which also implemented hardware T&amp;L.
3dfx's Voodoo5 5500 did not have a T&amp;L unit but it was able to match the performance of the GeForce 256, although the Voodoo5 was late to market and by its release it could not match the succeeding GeForce 2 GTS. 
STMicroelectronics' PowerVR Kyro II, released in 2001, was able to rival the costlier ATI Radeon DDR and NVIDIA GeForce 2 GTS in benchmarks of the time, despite not having hardware transform and lighting. As more and more games were optimised for hardware transform and lighting, the KYRO II lost its performance advantage and is not supported by most modern games. 
Futuremark's 3DMark 2000 heavily utilized hardware T&amp;L, which resulted in the Voodoo 5 and Kyro II both scoring poorly in the benchmark tests, behind budget T&amp;L video cards such as the GeForce 2 MX and Radeon SDR.
Industry standardization.
By 2000, only ATI with their comparable Radeon 7xxx series, would remain in direct competition with Nvidia's GeForce 256 and GeForce 2. By the end of 2001, all discrete graphics chips would have hardware T&amp;L. 
Support of hardware T&amp;L assured the GeForce and Radeon of a strong future, unlike its Direct3D 6 predecessors which relied upon software T&amp;L. While hardware T&amp;L does not add new rendering features, the extra performance allowed for much more complex scenes and an increasing number of games recommended it anyway to run at optimal performance. GPUs that support T&amp;L in hardware are usually considered to be in the DirectX 7.0 generation. 
After hardware T&amp;L had become standard in GPUs, the next step in computer 3D graphics was DirectX 8.0 with fully programmable vertex and pixel shaders. Nonetheless, many early games using DirectX 8.0 shaders, such as "Half-Life 2", made that feature optional so DirectX 7.0 hardware T&amp;L GPUs could still run the game. For instance, the GeForce 256 was supported in games up until approximately 2006, in games such as "".

Greatest Hits (1980 Kenny Rogers album)

Greatest Hits (sometimes referred to as Kenny Rogers' Greatest Hits) is the second compilation album by American singer-songwriter Kenny Rogers. It was released in September 1980 and issued by Liberty Records. The album marks Rogers' first release after United Artists Group merged with Liberty. The album was certified 12× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of 12 million copies in the US.
History.
The album reached No. 1 on both the Pop and Country charts in the US and featured three singles that were not included on any of Rogers' studio albums: "Lady" (written and produced specifically for Rogers by Lionel Richie, which was a No. 1 hit single in the same year), "Love The World Away" (a top five country and top 20 pop hit that was featured on the soundtrack of the 1980 film "Urban Cowboy") and "Long Arm of the Law" (a lesser known, but still relatively popular song among Rogers' loyal fan base).
The album features a further nine hit singles from Rogers' career, omitting a number of others (including "Daytime Friends", "Sweet Music Man" and "Love or Something Like It"). This didn't stop the album from being a massive success and confirmed Rogers' status as one of the most best-selling musicians in the US. It remains the best selling compilation release in country music, beating out Garth Brooks' 1994 limited-time-availability release "The Hits".
In the UK, the album was sold with the same artwork under the title "Lady" but differed slightly in the track listing, omitting "Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town" and "Reuben James" in favor of "Goodbye Marie" and "Sail Away".
The album is not the only Kenny Rogers release to be called "Greatest Hits". In 1971, while with The First Edition, an album under that title was released. Since 1980, many other collections by Rogers have been called "Greatest Hits", such as a 1985 Reader's Digest box set and the 1988 collection of his RCA material. However, this 1980 collection on Liberty was the first solo offering by Rogers to be given this designation.
In 1983, when Rogers changed labels to RCA Records, Liberty quickly issued "20 Greatest Hits", a more complete look at Rogers' hit list. However, both albums remained in catalog side by side for over two decades. Also in 1983, HBO re-released the "Greatest Hits" package on special picture discs. The track listing remained identical to the 1980 US release.
In the UK, where both 1981's "Lady" and the earlier The Kenny Rogers Singles Album had served as the two main compilations of Rogers' hit material, the original 1980 US version of this album was issued under its original title of "Greatest Hits" for the first time in 1983, exclusively on the new Compact Disc format.

South High School (Willoughby, Ohio)

South High School is a public high school in Willoughby, Ohio. It is one of three 
high schools in the Willoughby-Eastlake City School District. The school was created when the Willoughby Union High School was split into South High and North High School.
Located approximately 10 miles east of Cleveland, Willoughby South High School is located close to scenic and historical Downtown Willoughby. The total enrollment is approximately 1,200 students in grades 9-12. The principal is Brian Patrick and the two assistant principals are David Miller (11-12 grades) and Jennifer Neumeyer (9-10 grades). Tom Mckinnon is the athletic director.
Willoughby South, along with its sister school (and rival), Eastlake North High School, have been awarded the Blue Ribbon School award by the US Department of Education (the highest award attainable by American Schools), and both schools have competed in the Ohio Academic Decathlon competition multiple times.
Athletics.

Flag controversy.
For many years, the flag of South High was the Confederate Battle Flag used in the American Civil War. The school has since then adopted a new flag, which is simply a re-coloration of the Confederate Flag.
The original decision to name the school the "South Rebels" stemmed from the original Union High, with "South Rebels" seeming to some to be the logical name for the school after the "Union" was split. However, opponents argued that the school's name and logo seemed to celebrate the Confederacy, whose reasons for seceding from the Union had strong ties to the institution of slavery, and that the school was named during the Civil Rights Era.
In October 2010, a shirt depicting a re-coloration of the Confederate Flag was sold in the spirit shop. The principal decided to pull the shirts. The spirit shop offered to refund any money students paid for the shirt or to replace them with a less inflammatory version. However, many students chose to keep the Confederate flag shirt.
Shooting incident.
On September 2, 2008, a student brought a gun to school and fired two rounds within the school, one piercing the ceiling, another shattering a trophy case. The student then put the gun to his head, but was talked out of doing himself any harm by the Vice Principal of Willoughby South, Jeff Lyons.
Removal of Confederate Rebel Mascot.
On August 17, 2017, days after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Willoughby-Eastlake City Schools announced the decision to remove the Confederate soldier mascot while keeping the name "Rebels" and also the school colors of grey and blue.

UA Gaillac

Union Athlétique Gaillac is a French rugby union club currently competing in the Fédérale 3 league, the third level of the French amateur league system, after having been forcibly relegated from the second level of the French professional league due to serious financial problems. The club, founded in 1901, is based in the small town of Gaillac, in southwestern France, in the département of Tarn, some 70 km northeast of Toulouse. They play their home games at "Stade Laborie-Bernard Laporte", which was inaugurated in 1909. Their current coach is Alain Gaillard.
History.
The club was founded as "Stade Gaillacois" and was only the third rugby union club in Tarn. In 1905, it became "Stade Athlétique Gaillacois" and in 1910 "Union Sportive Gaillacoise". In 1940, the French rugby federation cancelled the championship and the club was forced out of business, but a new club was founded, "Union Athlétique Gaillacoise", with rugby, football, boxing, tennis, athletics, swimming and volleyball sections.
In 1948, the club associated with the local train workers and became "Union Athlétique des Cheminots (Railwaymen) de Gaillac". In 1950, the club reverted to its former name.
Gaillac was always in the lower divisions of the southwest rugby leagues until it managed to reach the lowest level of the national championship in 1968. It was relegated a few years after and had to wait until 2001 to join the highest level of amateur rugby called Fédérale 1. In 2006, finally, Gaillac reached the second professional division, Rugby Pro D2, after winning the Fédérale 1 title.
Gaillac finished in 10th place in their first season in Pro D2, but ran into serious financial difficulties, and proposed a merger with the nearby Graulhet club. The merger fell through, and after the end of the 2006-07 season, the French sporting authorities forcibly relegated Gaillac to Fédérale 1. The club was then placed into bankruptcy in July 2007, leading to a further drop to Fédérale 3.

IIT Madras

The Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras or IIT-M) is a public research university and technical institute located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the eight public Institutes of Eminence of India. As an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), IIT Madras is also recognized as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India.
Founded in 1959 with technical, academic and financial assistance from the then government of West Germany, IITM was the third Indian Institute of Technology established by the Government of India. IIT Madras has consistently ranked as the best engineering institute in India by the Ministry of Education's National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) since the ranking's inception in 2016.
History.
In 1956, the West German Government rendered technical assistance to establish a state-of-the-art engineering institute in India. Soon, the first Indo-German agreement was signed in Bonn, West Germany, in 1959 for the establishment of the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras (now Chennai). IIT Madras was started with technical, academic and financial assistance from the Government of West Germany. It was at the time the most significant international educational project sponsored by the Federal Republic of Germany. As part of the agreement, the West German government committed to providing various forms of assistance for the development of the institute in Madras:
This has led to several collaborative research efforts with universities and institutions in Germany over the years. Although official support from the German government has ended, several research efforts involving the DAAD programme and Humboldt Fellowships still exist.
The Indian Institute of Technology, Madras started functioning with the first batch of 120 students being admitted in July 1959 to the first year of the Engineering Course. The institute was inaugurated in 1959, by the then Union Minister for Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs. The first batch had an overall strength of 120 students from across India. In 1961, the IITs were declared to be Institutes of National Importance. The first convocation ceremony was held on 11 July 1964, with Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, then the president of India, delivering the convocation address and awarding the degrees to the inaugural batch of students. The institute got its first women students in the BTech batch of 1966. IIT Madras celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2009, and its Diamond Jubilee in 2019.
Campus.
The main entrance of IIT Madras is on Sardar Patel Road, flanked by the residential districts of Adyar and Velachery. The campus is close to the Raj Bhavan, the official residence of the Governor of Tamil Nadu. Other entrances are located in Velachery (near Anna Garden MTC bus stop, Velachery Main Road), Gandhi Road and Taramani gate (close to Ascendas Tech Park). The campus is located from the Chennai Airport, from the Chennai Central Railway station, and is connected by city buses. Kasturba Nagar is the nearest station on the Chennai MRTS line.
Two parallel roads, Bonn Avenue and Delhi Avenue, cut through the faculty residential area before they meet at the Gajendra Circle, near the Administrative Block. Buses regularly ply between the Main Gate, Gajendra Circle, the Academic Zone, and the Hostel Zone.
Student Hostels.
Most students at IIT Madras reside in hostels, where extracurricular activities complement the academic routine. The campus has 21 hostels, of which six —Sabarmati, Sarayu, Sharavati, Swarnamukhi, and the convertible Tunga-Bhadra — are currently exclusively for women. In earlier times, each hostel had attached dining facilities, but all of them have been closed down starting around 2010. Dining facilities are provided in three centralised halls: Nilgiri, Vindhya and Himalaya. Recently (2023), a new mess has been opened in the old Cauvery hostel mess for Jain food. Students are assigned to hostels upon matriculation, where they usually reside for the entire duration of their course of study.
The hostels of IITM are:
Mandakini, Sindhu, Pampa, Mahanadhi and Tamiraparani are seven-storeyed, whereas all the other hostels are three or four-storeyed. The latter four hostels can accommodate more than 1,200 students. The older hostels were all three-storeyed till the early 2000s, when extra rooms were added. An additional new floor in the three-storeyed hostels, which generally house the undergraduate students, and a new block in place of the mess halls of these hostels have been constructed to accommodate the increased intake of students. These new blocks could be used as entrances for these hostels. As of 2022, the old Mandakini has been demolished and a new multi-storey block opened, with provision to accommodate approximately 1200 students.
Facilities.
IIT Madras provides residential accommodation for its students, faculty, administrative and supporting staff, and their families. The residential houses employ private caterers. The self-contained campus includes two schools (Vanavani and Kendriya Vidyalaya), three temples (Jalakanteshwara, Durga Peliamman and Ganapathi), three bank branches (SBI, ICICI, Canara Bank), a hospital, shopping centres, food shops, a gym, sleeping room and cricket, football, hockey and badminton stadiums. The Internet is available in the academic zone and the faculty and staff residential zone. Earlier, the Internet was limited in the hostel zone from 2:00 pm to midnight and from 5:00 am to 8:00 am. However, increasing demand during the academic semester led to round-the-clock Internet service.
IIT Madras also has supercomputing capability, with the IBM Virgo Super Cluster with 97 teraflops worth of computational power.
Satellite Campuses.
IIT Madras set up an offshore campus in Tanzania in Africa as part of the Central government's IIT expansion plans abroad. 
In July 2023, education officials of India and Tanzania confirmed that the IIT Madras satellite campus in the Tanzanian autonomous territory of Zanzibar began offering classes in October 2023. IITM - Zanzibar is also the first IIT to have a female director, with Prof. Preeti Aghalayam heading the Zanzibar Campus.
In 2024, IIT Madras proposed plans to establish a second satellite campus internationally in Sri Lanka.
Organisation and administration.
Governance.
IIT Madras is an autonomous statutory organisation functioning within the Institutes of Technology Act. The twenty-three IITs are administered centrally by the IIT Council, an apex body established by the Government of India. The Minister of Human Resources and Development is the chairman of the council. Each institute has a board of governors responsible for its administration and control. The finance committee advises on matters of financial policy, while the Building and Works Committee advises on buildings and infrastructure.
The Senate comprises all professors of the institute and decides its academic policy. It controls and approves the curriculum, courses, examinations, and results. It appoints committees to examine specific academic matters. The director of the institute serves as the chairman of the Senate. The current director (appointed in 2022) is Kamakoti Veezhinathan, who obtained his Ph.D. and M.S in CSE from IIT Madras.
Three Senate Sub-Committees – The Board of Academic Research, The Board of Academic Courses and The Board of Students – help in academic administration and the operations of the institute. The Board of Industrial Consultancy and Sponsored Research addresses industrial consultancy, and the Library Advisory Committee oversees library matters.
Departments.
IIT Madras has the following departments
Academics.
IIT Madras offers undergraduate, postgraduate and research degrees across 18 disciplines in Engineering, Science, Humanities and Management. About 600 faculty belonging to science and engineering departments and centres of the institute are engaged in teaching, research and industrial consultancy.
The institute has 18 academic departments and advanced research centres across disciplines of engineering and pure sciences, with nearly 100 laboratories. The academic calendar is organised around the semester. Each semester provides a minimum of seventy days of instruction in English. Students are evaluated continuously throughout the semester. The faculty does evaluation, a consequence of the autonomous status granted to the institute. Research work is evaluated based on the review thesis by peer examiners, both from within the country and abroad. The Senate, the highest academic body within the institute prepare ordinances that govern the academic programme of study.
IITM is also gearing up to launch a new and completely online BEd degree programme in Maths and Computing to improve maths teaching in schools, as said by the director at the G20 seminar at IIT Madras.
Grading System and Student Evaluation.
The Indian Institutes of Technology have strict rules for grading. Depending on the course, the evaluation is based on participation in class, attendance, quizzes, exams and/or papers. Course instructors do continuous evaluation.
The Evaluation System of IIT Madras which is also used in other IITs is the Cumulative Grade Point Average with a scale from 0 to 10 which is converted to letters:
CGPA then gets calculated as the cumulative credit-weighted average of the grade points:
CGPA = (Σ Ci • GPi) / (Σ Ci)
where:
N is the number of courses
Ci is the credits for the ith course
GPi is the grade points for the ith course
CGPA is the cumulative grade point average
The CGPA is not the same as the one commonly used in the United States.
In India, some credits might be awarded during Bachelor studies for Co-curricular and Extra-curricular Activities, while during the Master's Programme, this is not allowed.
Through agreements with numerous international organisations, IIT grades are accepted by many international organisations like NTU, NUS and DAAD.
Additionally, the attendance of the students is evaluated with VG for very good (always present), G for good (not present every lecture), M for marginal (less than 85%) and P for poor (student was present less than 75% of lectures).
Admission tests.
For the undergraduate curriculum, admission to the BTech and Dual Degree (BS + MS or BTech + MTech) programme is done through the Joint Entrance Examination – Advanced (JEE-Advanced). IIT Madras was the organising institute of JEE Advanced in 2017 and 2024.
However, admissions to the BS Chemistry and BS Medical Sciences and Engineering (MSE) courses are not done through JEE Advanced but are done from a separate merit list made based on the rank obtained in IAT, upon separate registration on the IITM website.
Admissions to the 4-years online BS degree programmes for Data Science and Applications and Electronic Systems are taken through 2 channels: "JEE-based entry" (students clearing cutoff of JEE(Main) to be eligible to write JEE(Advanced) are eligible for direct entry to this course); "Regular Entry" through Qualifier Exam which is their entrance test, any student from any background and even professionals can sit in this test.
In 2025, IIT Madras introduced a new admission process for undergraduate programs, allowing students who have excelled in national and international Olympiads to secure seats without a JEE score. Moreover, they have also introduced a sports quota and fine arts and cultural excellence quota through which a candidate with national level achievements in various sports and cultural fields can apply for admission, after having qualified for JEE advanced.
For the postgraduate curriculum, admission to the MTech and MS programmes are through the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE); after 2022, with the discontinuation of 5 year integrated MA program and the same becoming a 2-year PG program, admissions is through GATE for the MA program also. The Joint Admission Test to MSc (JAM) is the entrance exam for the two-year MSc programme, and other post BSc programmes. MBA candidates are accepted through the Common Admission Test (CAT).
Academic research programmes.
The institute has departments and advanced research centres across the disciplines of engineering and the pure sciences, and nearly 100 laboratories.
Research programmes concern work undertaken by faculty members or specific research groups within departments that award an MS or PhD degree. Research is carried out by scholars admitted into these departmental programmes, under the guidance of their faculty. Each department makes known its areas of interest to the academic community through handbooks, brochures and bulletins. Topics of interest may be theoretical or experimental. IIT Madras has initiated 16 interdisciplinary research projects against identified focus areas.
Partnership with other universities.
The institute maintains academic friendships with educational institutes around the world through faculty exchange programmes. The institute has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with foreign universities, resulting in cooperative projects and assignments. The list of partners includes Auckland University of Technology, Massey University, Durham University, Sydney University, University of Colombo and other prestigious universities around the world.

Industries and organisations like the Indian Ordnance Factories, reach out to the IIT faculty to undertake assignments channelled through the Centre For Industrial Consultancy and Sponsored Research (ICSR).
National organisations sponsor programmes of research by funding projects undertaken by the faculty. Such research is time-bound and allows project participants to register for a degree. Project proposals are usually prepared by the IIT faculty and forwarded to interested organisations, based on the nature of their research and their interest in funding such projects.
Sponsored projects often serve as vehicles for new resources within departments, typically allowing their project staff to register for academic degrees in the institute. ICSR coordinates all sponsored research activities at the institute.
National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL).
To improve the quality of higher education in India, IIT Madras came up with an initiative called NPTEL (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) in the year 2003. As per this initiative, all the IITs, along with the IISc Bangalore would come up with a series of video lecture-based courses across all the streams of engineering. This initiative has gained wide popularity in India, and the lectures are being used by several engineering students from across India. It is the largest online repository in the world of courses in engineering, basic sciences and selected humanities and social sciences subjects.

Somanath have been hosted at IIT Madras for Extra Mural Lectures, to motivate the students and broaden their perspectives.
Extracurricular activities.
The Sustainability Network (S-Net) is an alumni-student-faculty initiative launched in May 2009 to help preserve the unique niche of one of the best educational campuses in India. S-Net was envisioned to work towards developing and deploying solutions for making a self-sustaining campus (focusing on energy/electricity, water, and waste management), which could eventually be replicated across the country through tie-ups with other educational institutions. 
The Fifth Estate is the official media body of IIT Madras and gives an insight into the happenings inside the campus and important news related to the institute.
The Open Air Theatre hosts the weekly movie, a Saturday night tradition, besides other activities. It seats over 7,000.
NSS in IIT Madras has been noted for taking up socially relevant initiatives, taken up as individual projects to create an impact on society as well as the students. The wing of NSS at IITM has over 400 students every year, contributing to the cause of the scheme. Since its inception, it has achieved many milestones in its history as a unique, student-run organisation. Linked with several NGOs and social organisations both within and outside Chennai. By working out projects from Braille magazines to technology interventions, from teaching children in urban slums to educational video content, NSS (IITM) seeks to challenge mediocre thinking and reach out into the darkness, to pull a hand into the light.
Student bodies such as Vivekananda Study Circle (VSC), Islamic Study Circle, IIT Christian Fellowship, Genesis and Reflections focus on spiritual discussions.
Regional groups include Marathi Mitra Mandal(MMM), Hindi Mitra Mandal(HMM), Karka Kasadara(Tamil), Kerala Kala Samithi(KKS), Garvi Gujarati Sangathan(GGS), Telugu Samskruthika Samithi and Kannada Samskrutika Sangh, North-east Students Association(SADINER), and African Students Association(AFSA) by students from African Continent.
The campus has evolved a slang, called Insti Lingo, attracting a published Master's thesis at a German University. A mix of English, Hindi, Telugu (Gult), Malayalam (Mallu) and Tamil (Tam), aspects of the campus slang have been adopted by some other Chennai colleges.
Unlike its sister institutions, IIT Madras has no single Indian language used among its students: Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Marathi, Kannada, English and Hindi are all very commonly used. All student participatory activities, such as debating, dramatics, short-film making, and others, are held in English. This is even reflected in the slang that uses more English and other Indian regional languages than Hindi, unlike in IITM's northern counterparts.
Prakriti Wildlife Club at IIT Madras was founded in April 2002 by students, faculty, staff, residents, and alumni who are wildlife enthusiasts.
IIT Madras Heritage Centre.
 The Heritage Centre was formally inaugurated by Dr Arcot Ramachandran, former Director IIT Madras on 3 March 2006. The centre is located on the ground floor of the administration building. The actual idea of a Heritage Centre was mooted in the year 2000 and has become a reality due to the efforts of the Professor-in-charge, Dr Ajit Kumar Kolar, and his team. The centre will function as a repository of material of heritage value and historical significance of various facets of the institute.
The exhibits include photographs, documents, publications, paintings, portraits, products developed and other articles. Information regarding important events, laboratory development, visits of important dignitaries, Indo-German cooperative activities, and academic achievements of faculty and students is also included. Aspects of IITM campus features and development, campus life and student activities are also included, thus broadening the scope of the centre in the future to non-academic activities.

Frank Klaus

Frank Klaus (December 30, 1887, in Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania – February 8, 1948) was an American boxer from 1904 to 1918. Known as the Braddock Bearcat, Klaus claimed the vacant World Middleweight Championship in 1913 and was elected to the Ring Boxing Hall of Fame in 1974. 
Gifted with a strong punch, he lost exceptionally few fights in his nine-year career, and was knocked out only once. Nat Fleischer ranked Klaus sixth as the All-Time Middleweight. His manager was George Engel.
Early life and career.
Frank Klaus was born on December 30, 1887, to German-American parents in Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. He worked as a young man at the Westinghouse Machine Shop, and also mined coal with his father. 
He started boxing training early and after winning an amateur tournament at East Pittsburgh's Wilmerding Athletic Club was recognized to have boxing promise by local boxing mentor George Engel. He began his amateur career as early as 1904, and in February 1905 had three round wins on points in Pittsburgh against Frank Walton, and James Harris.
On October 18, 1911, Klaus defeated the great contender Leo Houck in a newspaper win by both the "Philadelphia Item" and the "Philadelphia Record". During his career, the Pennsylvania-born middleweight fought some of the greatest welter, middle, and light heavyweights of his era, including Jack Dillon, Battling Levinsky, Mike Gibbons, Harry Greb, and Al McCoy.
Claiming and defending the World Middleweight Title.
Klaus claimed the World Middleweight Title a few years after it became vacant upon the death of Stanley Ketchel in October 1910. Several contenders competed for the title. Accounts vary as to when Klaus was officially champion, but Klaus himself first claimed the title after defeating Sailor Ed Petrosky in a 20-round points decision in San Francisco on February 22, 1912. His victories over Jack Dillon, and later fellow claimant Georges Carpentier and former champion Billy Papke in France, cemented his claim to the title. He was officially recognized as champion by sanctioning bodies on March 5, 1913.
In his historic title bout against Georges Carpentier on June 24, 1912, in Dieppe, France, Klaus won on a nineteenth round disqualification when Carpentier's manager entered the ring to protest his boxer being elbowed repeatedly by Klaus. Carpentier's manager tried to pull his fighter from the ring by his waist, but the boxer's second had already thrown in the towel.
On September 9, 1912, Klaus defeated Marcel Moreau in Savoie, France as the result of a low blow foul in the fourth of fifteen rounds. Moureau had held the French Middleweight Title in May 1908.
Defeating Billy Papke for the Middleweight Title.
In a title fight that led to world title recognition, Klaus defeated American Billy Papke at the Cirque du Paris on March 5, 1913, in a fifteenth-round disqualification. The referee stopped the fight in the fifteenth as a result of Papke continually ignoring his requests to fight cleanly. Klaus was winning by a significant margin. Papke had been warned throughout the fight for flagrant violations of boxing rules. Klaus received a gold belt for the victory.
In another important win that cemented his claim to the title, Klaus defeated contender Eddie McGoorty on May 24, 1913, in a six-round bout in Pittsburgh. The "Pittsburgh Gazette" gave Klaus five of the six rounds.
On July 1, 1913, Klaus had an important win where he was awarded a third-round TKO against Jimmy Gardner in Boston. Gardner had contended for the World Welterweight Championship earlier in his career. Gardner put up a great defense until the end of the second round, when Klaus threw some hard punches over the defenses of Gardner. After Klaus continued to connect with hard blows, a second of Gardner's jumped into the ring in the middle of the third round to end the fight. Klaus had faced Gardner on at least three previous occasions.
Losing the World Middleweight Title to George Chip.
During a title fight on 11 October 1913, George Chip baffled the crowd when he knocked out Klaus with a strong right hook to the jaw. The knockout came near the end of the sixth and final round. Prior to the knockout, in the first five rounds, Chip never threatened to take the lead. The fight occurred at the old Pittsburgh City Hall at Market Square . It was the first loss by knockout in Klaus's career. The extra weight Klaus was carrying in his midsection led many reporters to believe he had not trained adequately for the bout, and had underestimated the ability of his opponent.
In a return non-title match on December 23, 1913, Chip defeated Klaus again. In the fifth round of six, the referee stopped the fight resulting in a technical knockout after Chip knocked Klaus to the mat for a second time. In what most considered a decisive win, the "Scranton Truth" wrote that Chip was the master of Klaus in every way, and clearly deserved the title he had taken from him two months earlier.
Retirement from boxing and death.
Klaus retired from boxing at age 26 shortly after his second loss to George Chip.
Klaus died February 8, 1948, at his home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania after a severe heart attack. He was survived by his widow, two sons and three daughters.

<doc id="6961235" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6961235" title="Yotsuba Koiwai">
Yotsuba Koiwai

, also known as just , is a fictional character and the main protagonist in the comedy manga series "Yotsuba&amp;!", as well as the one-shot manga "Try! Try! Try!", both by Kiyohiko Azuma. As the title character of both the series itself and almost every chapter, Yotsuba is usually the focus of each episode; most stories revolve around her meeting, and often childishly misunderstanding, a new concept or activity indicated in the chapter title. She is noted for her childish energy, unusual , and iconic appearance.
Development.
Yotsuba first appeared in a one-shot manga published in 1998 and two webcomics called "Try! Try! Try!", where she appears very similar as she does in "Yotsuba&amp;!"; for example, Yotsuba has the same personality and a very similar chibi design.
Appearance and personality.
Yotsuba is drawn as a small girl with green hair done in four pigtails, giving her somewhat the appearance of her namesake, a . She has a carefree and energetic personality, taking delight in simple matters even as she learns about all manner of things in her daily life. From chapter 3 onwards, Yotsuba's dialogue in Japanese is written without kanji, making it seem simpler and more childlike, and in a simple, large, and bold typeface, which gives the impression that she is speaking with high intensity. Her energy is noted by other characters, especially members of the neighboring Ayase family. Her father says of her carefree nature, "She can find happiness in anything. Nothing in this world can get her down." However, when deeply frightened or upset, she does cry, and she has a fear of anything resembling a bullseye because it resembles an eye that "is staring at her".
At the start of the series, Yotsuba is shown as having very little knowledge of the world around her, even for a young child. Things such as swings, doorbells, cicadas, air conditioners, and recycling all fascinate and confuse her, although she is not perturbed by her ignorance. She occasionally mispronounces new words and creates neologisms, such as the name for her a portmanteau of "Yotsuba" and that she uses to keep special things and her "scapbuk" (scrapbook). She often repeats, in incongruous ways, phrases spoken by adult characters around her without fully knowing the meaning, so she sometimes says vulgar words. A famous example of this is when Yotsuba learned the phrase "what the hell, man!” from her father's friend Takeshi Takeda, who Yotsuba calls Jumbo. Yotsuba is able to slowly sound out writing in hiragana, and is praised for this by Jumbo, but she cannot correctly read a clock. She is frequently shown drawing, though she is not as good an artist as she thinks she is, and she is an excellent swimmer.
The series provides few details about her life before its start. She is an adopted child, with her birthplace unknown to the reader, although she claims she's from an island "to the left." Koiwai, Yotsuba's adopted father, says he met her as an orphan in a foreign country and before he knew it he was raising her as his own; she is sometimes taken for a foreigner by strangers. When asked about her mother, she doesn't understand the question, and she gets confused by the concept of having two sets of grandparents. Before moving to her current home, Yotsuba lived in the country with Koiwai and his mother. She initially claims she is six years old, but her father later corrects this, saying she is in fact five years old.
Yotsuba has never attended school yet, as she is slightly too young for it, and as of the first chapter does not know what a grade is. In volume 6, chapter 35, she fails to understand repeated explanations of homework but in Volume 15, chapter 104, she begins preparations for starting school in the next year, such as buying her backpack.
Reception.
The character of Yotsuba is cited by reviewers as one of the key appeals of "Yotsuba&amp;!", especially her energy, enthusiasm, and sense of wonder. For example, one wrote, "Yotsuba’s wide-eyed awe at each discovery, from the idea of a milkman to learning how to catch fish, is both inspiring and infectious. You want to see what happens next, because she continually comes across as genuine without turning into cloying." A reviewer at "Anime News Network" wrote, "What is really special about Yotsuba, though, is that newness with which she, as a child, sees the world. That the manga allows us to glimpse the world through those same eager eyes is what gives it appeal far beyond its humor." Johanna Draper Carlson, long-time comics reviewer for "Publishers Weekly", said that "Yotsuba is a sponge of a character, with infinite possibility as she learns about life. Watching her do so is both fun and funny, and the way she finds enjoyment in everything is inspirational. It creates an infectious feeling of shared joy in the reader." Another claimed that "Yotsuba Koiwai's adventures are ... a lucid and charming look at the world through a child's eyes, as she gets into scrapes that remind us all of our own childhoods (if only through manga-tinted glasses)."
Reviewers often describe Azuma's depiction of her as realistic, especially compared to depictions of children in other manga and anime. One review claimed that "Yotsuba in particular is amusing, because she acts and speaks with that peculiar mix of honesty, immediacy, and childish logic that only young children seem to possess ... Yotsuba isn't a silent, simpering sweetie-pie, she acts like a real five-year-old." On the other hand, Tom Spurgeon claimed Yotsuba is "an idealized kid of that early age, retaining a wide-eye wonder and furious energy, minus the things that crop up at that age like cruelty and deception" and a reviewer in "Newtype USA" said that "Her hijinks are sweetly innocent, like a cuter, more naïve version of Dennis the Menace minus the 'menace'."

Special Actions Detachment

The Special Actions Detachment () or DAE is a special forces unit of the Portuguese Navy. It is part of the Portuguese Marine Corps. Raised in 1985, the DAE is one of the smallest special forces units within the Portuguese Armed Forces. It is responsible for conducting air-sea rescue, amphibious reconnaissance, amphibious warfare, black operation, bomb disposal, CBRN defense, coastal raiding, counterterrorism, direct action, executive protection, hostage rescue, irregular warfare, ISTAR, long-range penetration, JTAC, manhunt high-value target, maritime sabotage, mountain rescue, naval boarding, operation behind high risk enemy lines, special operations, special reconnaissance, tracking targets, underwater demolition, unconventional warfare, other missions in support of Portuguese and NATO armed forces. DAE's mission and training are similar to their American counterparts DEVGRU and the British SBS. DAE often trains with them alongside other counter-terror units.
Organization.
The unit is led by a commander, and is subdivided into a command cell and four combat teams. The command cell contains the unit commander, his deputy (a lieutenant commander) and a small staff of eight. The combat teams are composed of ten men: petty officers and seamen and a commanding petty officer.
The unit can operate, as a whole, organized as a Special Operation Maritime Task Unit (SOMTU). As a SOMTU, it can operate autonomously or, together with the Portuguese Army Special Operations Forces, as part of a joint Special Operation Task Group (SOTG). It can also operate, together with special forces of allied countries, as part of a combined SOTG.
Selection and training.
DAE operatives are drawn from the ranks of marines, all having high operational experience. Due to the nature of its actions, candidate acceptance is extremely restrictive and selective. Only 5–10% of the applicants manage to join the unit.
Upon completion of the basic selection phase prospective recruits then begin the first phase of their training. Phase 1 of their training is conducted at the Navy's combat diver school. Students receive instruction in: basic combat diving techniques, EOD and underwater demolitions.
Candidates who successfully complete the first phase are assigned to the DAE on a probationary status, and begin their second phase of training. Phase 2 instruction includes courses on: escape and evasion techniques, advanced driving, mountaineering, offensive operations, parachuting training and basic English. Once a trainee is permanently assigned to the DAE he will continue to receive various courses of instruction throughout his career.
After this tough selection, COEMAR starts, which lasts 18 weeks and is divided into three phases:
During and after COEMAR, DAE's military personnel receive training in areas as varied as:
Operations.
DAE conducts regular training exercises with its NATO counterparts, including the United States Navy SEALs, Spanish "Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial", French "Commandos Marine", Polish JW GROM, Lithuanian Special Operations Force as well as the respective naval counter-terrorist units. 
They were deployed to:

Knights of St Columba

The Knights of St Columba is a fraternal service order affiliated with the Catholic Church in Scotland, in England and Wales, and, through their Province of Liverpool, in the Isle of Man. Founded in Glasgow in 1919, the Knights are named in honour of Saint Columba, a 6th-century Celtic Church missionary descended from the Gaelic nobility of Ireland in modern County Donegal, who founded Iona Abbey and successfully evangelized both the Picts and Gaels of modern Scotland. The Knights describes themselves as dedicated to the principles of Charity, Unity and Fraternity. There are around 2400 members of the KSC, in over 200 councils across Great Britain — it features in England, Scotland and Wales. Membership is limited to Catholic men aged 16 and over, and promotes the social doctrine of the Catholic Church.
The organisation is apolitical and essentially democratic, does not admit women, and exists to support the mission of the Catholic Church. The KSC organisation is a member of the International Alliance of Catholic Knights. Founder of the Knights at Glasgow in 1919 and the first Supreme Knight was P. J. O'Callaghan.
Admission ceremonies usually take place in a Catholic parish during the celebration of Mass.
The group organises annual Christian pilgrimages to Aylesford Priory in Kent and Carfin Lourdes Grotto near Motherwell in North Lanarkshire. The 2019 centennial of the Knights' foundation was celebrated with a special pilgrimage to Iona Abbey, which was founded by the Knights' patron saint, followed by a Mass offered on site.
History.
The organisation was formed on 5 October 1919.
In 1995, the organisation was reported to have 10,000 members, including artisans and small business owners.
In 2005, the Knights of St Columba in St Albans were involved in fundraising for school projects in Indonesia.
In 2012, the organisation made public calls, reported in the news, for a street in York to be named after local Elizabethan era Catholic saint Margaret Clitherow, who had been canonized by Pope Paul VI as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales.
In 2018, "The Times of London" reported that the Knights, after meticulous research, had made a ruling that Alice Nutter, a Lancashire noblewoman and Recusant who was convicted and executed for attending a witches' coven on Good Friday, 1612, was in reality a Catholic martyr. According to the Knights, Nutter had in reality been attending an illegal Mass at the time of the alleged coven and the prosecution was a frameup by a corrupt judge who coveted the Nutter estate, but who could not prove that Nutter was a Catholic. Accusing Nutter during the Pendle witch hunt, according to the Knights, was an easy alternative, particularly as she could not prove her innocence of witchcraft without self-incrimination for Recusancy. The Knights accordingly expressed support for Alice Nutter's Canonization.
Since 2020, the Knights' Council 1 at the University of Glasgow has been promoting Fr Alexander Cameron (1701-1746) by distributing holy cards with a prayer for his Canonization as a Saint and a Martyr by the Catholic Church. Fr. Cameron (), was an outlawed Jesuit "heather priest" working among Clan Chisholm and Clan Fraser of Lovat in Strathglass, the Aird, and Glen Cannich during the Penal Laws and Jacobite Army military chaplain, who died after the Battle of Culloden aboard a Royal Navy prison hulk anchored in the River Thames. The same Council has also been involved in spreading the Legion of Mary and the St Vincent de Paul Society to fellow Millennial and Generation Z students, and in launching the new Brecbannoch Pilgrimage; bearing the relics of St Andrew, St Columba, and St Margaret of Scotland, which are on loan from Carfin Grotto, on foot inside a replica of the Brecbannoch of St Columba to Iona Abbey.
Organisation.
At local level, Members belong to a Council or Charter Council, led by the Grand Knight. The Charter Councils in an area (often corresponding to a Catholic Diocese) come together to form a Province, under the Provincial Grand Knight. Provinces are arranged into larger areas known as Regions, under the Regional Director, who is a member of the Board of Directors. Representatives of the Board of Directors, Regions and Provinces meet at least once annually at the Supreme Council which governs the Order. The Supreme Knight presides over the Supreme Council.

Jason Göbel (born September 30, 1970) is an American guitarist, best known for being a member of the progressive metal band Cynic during their original run.
With Cynic, he recorded on several of their first demos as well as on their 1993 debut album "Focus".
History.
Gobel joined Cynic in 1988, alongside Jack Kelly, Mark Van Erp, Paul Masvidal, and Sean Reinert. He first met the band at a show where they played alongside his brother's band, who introduced them after their set. In 1989, the band released Reflections of a Dying World with Gobel on guitars, with Masvidal taking over vocal duties. The band released two other demos between the years of 1990 and 1991, before the band members received individual offers to join additional bands.
While Reinert and Masvidal had joined Death and Tony Choy had joined both Atheist and Pestilence, Gobel had joined the Florida-based death metal band Monstrosity. Gobel noted this was done with the strategy of passing the Cynic name around the scene by the individual members' reputations. The band were needing another guitarist for their album and had five songs finished, with Gobel working on three more. In 1992, the band released their debut album "Imperial Doom" with Gobel working alongside future Cannibal Corpse vocalist George "Corpsegrinder" Fisher and future Malevolent Creation members Jon Rubin, Mark Van Erp, and Lee Harrison.
Once Cynic received a label offer from Roadrunner Records, Gobel returned to the band alongside Masvidal and Reinert, who had recently been fired from Death with the new member bassist Sean Malone. Roadrunner released a split with Cynic as well as Pestilence and progressive thrash metal band Believer, called "The Breed Beyond". The band recorded their debut album, "Focus", which was put out through Roadrunner in 1993. The album is widely considered one of the greatest progressive metal albums ever, however, it did not initially go over well. The band embarked on the "Focus" tour with Cannibal Corpse and dissolved soon thereafter due to the lack of interest from the audience.
Following the dissolution of Cynic, Gobel formed a project with Masvidal and Reinert in an attempt to create a more commercially viable project with 
Portal, a lighter side project of the band Cynic. The project had backing from Atlantic Records, however, it did not release for many years due to the individual members' contract with Roadrunner. The demo came out in 1995, however the project dissolved by 1996. Gobel played with Gordian Knot, a band formed by Sean Malone, also a former Cynic member on the 2003 album, "Emergent".
In 2020, Gobel returned from his musical hiatus with Eggshell Repair Kit, a project that featured Reinert and two former "Traced in Air"-era Cynic members guitarist Tymon Kruidenier and bassist Robin Zielhorst, who were both in Our Oceans and Exivious as well. The project debut in September 2020, following Reinert's passing. Since returning to music, Gobel began working with Santiago Dobles (ex-Pestilence, Aghora) on a project called Verdana.
Personal life.
He lives in Miami with his two children. When Gobel was 17, he began working as a dog trainer, assisting dogs in training for bomb detection, cadaver detection, drug detection, and several other forms of training. He worked in the field for around 10 years. He also operated as a locksmith during his time with Cynic.

Malietoa Tanumafili I

Susuga Malietoa Tanumafili I (1879 – 5 July 1939) was the Malietoa in Samoa from 1898 until his death in 1939. After the death of his father, Malietoa Laupepa, who was recognized as king of Samoa by many Western countries, Tanumafili was immediately crowned, with Tupua Tamasese Lealofi I serving as vice-king. Tanumafili was backed by the United States and United Kingdom, however Germany supported rebel chief Mata‘afa Iosefo who was eyeing the throne. The battle between the two made up the Second Samoan Civil War and in the end caused the Tripartite Convention that split the islands. After the war, Malietoa pursued education in Fiji and then came back to Samoa, where he was appointed as an advisor.
Personal and political life.
Tanumafili was born in 1880 to Malietoa Laupepa and Sisavai‘i Malupo Niuva‘ai. He attended the London Missionary College in Malua, before continuing his education in Fiji.
He married Momoe Lupeuluiva Meleiseā and had five children: Sisavai‘i Lupeuluiva, Vaimo‘oi‘a, Salamāsina, Tanumafili II, and Sāvea‘ali‘i Ioane Viliamu.
When his father died in 1898, Tanumafili was declared "King of Samoa" (Tafaʻifa) by William Lea Chambers, and recognised by Germany, the United Kingdom and United States. However, this led to the outbreak of the Second Samoan Civil War.
The vast majority of Samoa rallied behind the Matā‘afa-Sā Talavou party, including the Germans, the Tumua of Ātua-A‘ana, the Pule of Savai‘i (Keesing 1934:73), ‘Aiga-i-le-Tai, and most of Tuamasaga. Once again socio-religious factors came into play as the Sā Mōlī’s support came from the L.M.S. Tanumafili's royal house was made up of four families: Matavai, Silliaumua, Tupuola and Fagafua, the last remaining dynasty in the western part of Samoa. They were Congregationalists, while most other Samoan Christians backed the Sā Talavou-Sā Natūitasina-Matā‘afa parties. Perhaps the most adamant and well-known opponent of Tanumafili’s claim was Lauaki Namulau‘ulu Mamoe of Sāfotulafai, Savaiʻi, a famed orator who carried the Tongan matapule title Lauaki (Gifford 149). He argued that not only was Tanumafili too young and inexperienced to rule, but that his installment as Malietoa was illegitimate and invalid according to Samoan custom. The vast majority of Samoans, including the leading orator bodies of Ātua-A‘ana (Tumua), Savai‘i (Pule), Manono, and Tuamasaga (Auimatagi) attested to the invalidity of Tanumafili’s claims to the kingship and the Malietoa title but the foreign powers continued in their endorsement of Malietoa Tanumafili I. A joint session of the Pule and Tumua assemblies held fono in Leulumoega, A‘ana and declared Matā‘afa Iosefo "King of Samoa" on 12 November 1898; this pronouncement was ratified at a national council held on 15 November at Mulinu‘u.
Foreign intervention and native opinion.
The British and American consuls defied this declaration (as did Tanumafili I and Lealofi I) and their naval ships and soldiers assisted in defeating Matā‘afa Iosefo as the year 1898 came to a close; Tanumafili I was declared King of Samoa on 31 December. The Tumua communities joined with the Sā Talavou and Matā‘afa parties in immediately protesting Tanumafili's appointment, prompting the One Day War in which Tanumafili and Tamasese allies were defeated on 1 January 1899. Fearing for their lives, King Tanumafili I and Vice-King Tamasese Lealofi boarded a British ship where they lived for over two months to avoid assassination attempts. The Germans then declared Matā‘afa the "head of all chiefs" while the British and the American consuls nominated Tanumafili as the ruler of Samoa (Hart, Hart &amp; Harris 105). Matā‘afa's parties declared him king once again in January, while "all the High Chiefs of Malietoa" Laupepa were in exile in Tutuila and Malietoa Laupepa himself remained under the protection of the British; there was no military opposition to the coronation that day.
Tanumafili's high chiefs were allowed to return from Tutuila in March 1899 and war parties were reorganized. Tanumafili was able to defeat Matā‘afa with the ammunition and military aid of the Americans and British, and the foreign consuls once again named Tanumafili as King of Samoa on 23 March.
Foreign political influences by this time had become deeply ingrained in the Samoan struggle for leadership. A committee composed of the foreign consuls called together the leaders of both parties on 20 May 1899. Matā‘afa Iosefo, Malietoa Fa‘alata and Lauaki Namulau‘ulu Mamoe are mentioned as high-ranking spokesmen of the Matā‘afa-Sā Talavou bloc while Tupua Tamasese Titimaea and Malietoa Laupepa headed the Tamasese-Sā Mōlī delegation. The joint commission of Germany, the United States and Great Britain abolished the Samoan kingship in June 1899 and placed Manu‘a and Tutuila under American control while Germany received ‘Upolu, Savaii, Manono, and Apolima. The official tri-nation "adjustment of jurisdiction" was signed in Washington, D.C., on 7 November without any mention of Samoan consent or opinion; no Samoan chiefs signed the convention nor is there explicit indication that the Samoans were even aware of the impending dissection of their island group. Under this new government Matā‘afa Iosefo was named Ali‘i Sili ("Paramount Chief") of Samoa while the German Kaiser was declared Tupu Sili ("Paramount King") of Samoa. The young Tanumafili – no longer King of Samoa – then left for the British Fijian islands to further his university education.
Tanumafili I and German administration.
The Kaiser sent Dr. Wilhelm Solf to govern German Samoa in March 1900. Solf seemed to be supportive (or at least cognizant) of the native political system that previous European consuls had blatantly disregarded. In 1901 he oversaw a massive distribution of 2,000 fine state-mats (‘ie o le mālō) which served to acknowledge the authority of traditional chiefs while demonstrating a level of cultural sensitivity on the part of the German Empire (Keesing 1934:84). The ceremonial distribution took several months to complete and not all Samoan parties were satisfied with the recognition they received and/or the fact that the German administration oversaw the distribution. Other Samoan chiefs were upset over a perceived "attitude" adjustment of their paramounts; in 1901, Matā‘afa announced:
Similarly, Malietoa Tanumafili disappointed many of his followers when he refused to accept the kingly "‘ava" (also known as kava) and instead passed on his "rights and privileges" to the German government. In January 1903, having arrived from Fiji, he declared:
Solf and the German imperial officers came to confide in Matā‘afa Iosefo and endorsed him as the legitimate leader of the itū mālō. Matā‘afa's actions later in his term, however, reveal that his declared obeisance to Germany was probably a front for underlying motives and sentiments (the type of togafiti deception that Solf frequently condemned). In order to maintain the peace among "those who had not been recognised, but who had, in genealogical and recent historical terms, equal rank," Solf also allowed for the appointment of other paramount tama‘aiga to government offices (Meleiseā 1987b:50). This representation was accomplished by installing the acknowledged heads of the Sā Tupua and the Sā Malietoa as "Ta‘imua." The office of Ta‘imua was an executive and advisory position first held by Tupua Tamasese Lealofi I of the Sā Tupua and Malietoa Fa‘alataitaua of the Sā Malietoa Talavou.
Tanumafili I and the New Zealand Government.
Tanumafili returned to Samoa and began reasserting his claim to the Malietoa title only after Malietoa Fa‘alataitaua had died (Tamasese 1995b:75). Hostilities arose between Tanumafili's Sā Mōlī, the Sā Talavou parties, and Matā‘afa Iosefo over rights to the Malietoa title. Tensions were so high that Malietoa Fa‘alata's sons needed to be safeguarded against rivals who wished to eliminate potential claimants. When Matā‘afa Iosefo died on 6 February 1912, he took the office of Ali‘i Sili to his grave and Malietoa Tanumafili regained support as Fautua and the sole Malietoa. It is probably in this year that Tanumafili also received the Tamasoāli‘i and Gato‘aitele supposedly carried by the Matā‘afa until 1912.
New Zealand’s Lieutenant-Colonel Logan elicited the German surrender of the western Samoan islands in 1914 and began reorganizing Samoa’s government. New Zealand assured the Samoan people that the new government would be for Samoa’s benefit, unlike the German regime which was instated at great cost to Samoan autonomy and traditional authority. After opening Samoa’s first banking institution and deporting most German citizens, the New Zealand administration appointed Malietoa Tanumafili and Tupua Tamasese Lealofi I as joint Fautua. After Tupua Tamasese Lealofi’s death on 13 October 1915, Tanumafili served as Fautua along with Tuimaleali‘ifano Si‘u.
Under New Zealand occupation many Samoans began acting on their desires for self-autonomy. Many Samoan customs which had been suppressed under German rule, such as ceremonial ‘ie toga exchanges and kilikiti matches, returned to normal function. Local chiefs were also at liberty "to make rules in the best interests of the village" and village fono began retaking administrative powers lost to the Germans (Meleiseā 1987a:112). Tanumafili had been a founding member of Apia's so-called Toe‘aina Club which provided high-ranking Samoan chiefs a venue for socialization and collaboration. The club also gave Samoans a place to resolve conflicts involving titles or property without requiring New Zealand’s interference.
On 17 December 1920 the League of Nations granted British-New Zealand mandate over "German Samoa" and King George V of the United Kingdom became the titular King of Samoa. Sir George Richardson's administration was widely opposed and by 1927 the leaders of the four Samoan royal families, or tama‘aiga, were divided in their opinions about New Zealand rule. Matā‘afa Salanoa and Malietoa Tanumafili appeared to be loyal – "at least in public" – to the New Zealand administration (Meleiseā 1987b:142) while Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III and Tuimaleali‘ifano Si‘u supported the Samoan independence movement known as the Mau. The Mau grew out of discontent with Richardson's policies and growing distrust of foreign intervention in Samoan affairs. The Mau was a nonviolent movement devoted to civil disobedience but it was opposed by some Samoans, specifically those allied to the Malietoa families and villages, among them Vaimauga (Tuamasaga), Aleipata (Ātua) and Falealili (Ātua). In March 1928, Malietoa supporters around Apia took offense to the anti-government rallies conducted by a particular Mau group from Savaii and had it not been for Tanumafili's intervention a tragic massacre probably would have taken place. The Malietoa factions did not oppose the Mau because they desired to be ruled by New Zealand. Like all Samoans they longed for independence too, but the "non-Mau Samoans" (Meleiseā 1987b:145) were convinced that the Mau's opposition of New Zealand was a direct challenge to Malietoa authority since Tanumafili was Fautua of the foreign government.
Tanumafili was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1929, and was appointed an honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the New Zealand government, in the 1931 New Year Honours. Following moves towards self-government he resigned from the Legislative Council in 1937 to allow the new "Fono" to select someone else.
He died in 1939 after 41 years as Malietoa.

Clawback

The term clawback or claw back refers to any money or benefits that have been given out, but are required to be returned (clawed back) due to special circumstances or events, such as the money having been received as the result of a financial crime, or where there is a clawback provision in the executive compensation contract.
In law, clawback is most commonly known as restitution.
From government grantees.
In the past, clawback phenomena have been used primarily in securing tax incentives, abatements, tax refunds, and grants. Clawbacks are distinguished from repayments or refunds as they involve a penalty, in addition to a repayment.
The use of tax incentives for attracting jobs and capital investment has grown over the past decades to include performance measures from which to gauge a company's growth. Typical measures are:
More unusual measures are retaining a headquarters at a specific site for a period of time, amount of production increase or production cost decrease per unit, or the requirement to bring a given technology to a commercial market. The recipient will be required to return the monetary value of the incentive plus a penalty and/or interest to the grantor of the incentive, usually a local or state taxing authority. As the use of incentives mature over time, it is sometimes alleged that the triggering of clawbacks for non-performance will likely become more ubiquitous.
Clawbacks can be understood to be the contractual elements that stand between the drive for economic development and community development and the slippery slope of corporate welfare. They are highly controversial and are utilized as community-based guarantees for some expectation of performance. The site location industry normally tries to eliminate or reduce any such promises as part of their negotiations.
From employees.
Clawback provision.
A "clawback provision" is a contractual clause typically included in employment contracts by financial firms, by which money already paid to an employee must be paid back to the employer under certain conditions.
The employees' bonuses are, in a clawback scheme, tied specifically to the performance (or lack thereof) of the financial product(s) the individual(s) may have created and/or sold as part of his or her job expecting a high profit. If the product does indeed do well over a long period of time, and permanently improves the nature of the firm, the bonuses paid to the individual are allowed to be retained by the individual. However, if the product fails, and damages the nature of the firm—even years down the line from the product's inception—then the firm has the right to revoke, reclaim, or otherwise repossess some or all of the bonus amount(s). However, research shows managers who are subject to clawback provisions that are newly in place in a company often try to offset their increased risk of bonus clawback by demanding an increase in base salary that is not subject to being clawed back.
The prevalence of clawback provisions among Fortune 100 companies increased from lower than 3% prior to 2005, to 82% in 2010. The growing popularity of clawback provisions is likely, at least in part, due to the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, which requires the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pursue the repayment of incentive compensation from senior executives who are involved in a fraud. In practice, the Securities and Exchange Commission has enforced its clawback powers in only a small number of cases.
The Dodd–Frank Act of 2010 mandates that the SEC require that U.S. public companies include a clawback provision in their executive compensation contracts that is triggered by any accounting restatement, regardless of fault (whereas the clawback provisions per the Sarbanes–Oxley Act only applied to intentional fraud). As of mid-2015, this portion of the Dodd–Frank Act had yet to be implemented.
Faithless servant clawback.
Under the faithless servant doctrine, an employee who commits a crime in his work or fails to follow the company code of conduct or code of ethics is subject to having all of his compensation clawed back by the employer. In "Morgan Stanley v. Skowron", 989 F. Supp. 2d 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), applying New York's faithless servant doctrine, the court held that a hedge fund's portfolio manager engaging in insider trading in violation of his company's code of conduct, which also required him to report his misconduct, must repay his employer the full $31 million his employer paid him as compensation during his period of faithlessness. The court called the insider trading the "ultimate abuse of a portfolio manager's position." The judge also wrote: "In addition to exposing Morgan Stanley to government investigations and direct financial losses, Skowron's behavior damaged the firm's reputation, a valuable corporate asset."
Implications.
The usual objective of a clawback provision is to deter managers from publishing incorrect accounting information. Academic research finds that voluntarily adopted clawback provisions appear to be effective at reducing both intentional and unintentional accounting errors. The same study also finds that investors have greater confidence in a firm's financial statements after clawback adoption, and that boards of directors place greater weight on accounting numbers in executive bonuses after a clawback is in place ("i.e.", pay for performance sensitivity increases).
According to a December 2010 "New Yorker" magazine article, the clawback phenomenon pursued by banks and other financial groups directly and/or indirectly responsible for the 2008 financial crisis has been used by the chief administrators of those institutions in order to make the case that they are taking tangible self-corrective action to both prevent another crisis (by supposedly dis-incentivizing the sorts of shady investment-product behavior displayed by their people in the past) and to appropriately punish any potential future activity of a similar sort. However, some professional economists have argued that it is unlikely that either result will become the case, and that employee clawbacks are better seen as a public relations tactic until the impact of the 2008 financial crisis fades and similar abuses of the financial system can resume, with minimal or no detection by outside forces.
Notable cases.
In the United States, clawbacks were rarely used until 2006. Major cases included a $600 million clawback affecting William W. McGuire of UnitedHealth Group, $500 million affecting Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco, and in 2019 clawbacks of compensation for the former CEO of Wells Fargo John Stumpf as well as a colleague.
From investors.
Clawback lawsuits in US courts, especially from innocent individuals and entities who profited from financial crimes of others, have increased in the years since 2000.
The yearslong clawback undertaken after the Madoff investment scandal, which attempted to transfer money back from the financial winners to the financial losers among those who had invested in Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, is notable both for the size and success of the operation. A team of lawyers headed by Irving Picard were able to recover over $13 billion, or about 75%, of the estimated $19 billion collectively lost by investors, and transfer it back to those investors who had claimed losses. This was a far higher percentage than the usual recovery rate for investor clawbacks, which typically ranges from 5 to 30 percent. Of the recovered money, $7.2 billion came from the estate of just one investor, Jeffry Picower; it was the largest civil forfeiture payment in U.S. history.
Other clawback types.
Clawback provisions are also used in bankruptcy matters where insiders may have raided assets prior to a filing. The aim of the clause is to secure an option for an employer or trustee to limit bonuses, compensation, or other remuneration in case of catastrophic shifts in business, bankruptcy, and national crisis such as the 2008 financial crisis.
In various countries.
Italy and the Netherlands have several clawback regimes, and there are two clawback regimes in the United Kingdom. The French clawback regime is limited. In Belgium, their enforceability is unclear.

Gambling 3NT

In the card game contract bridge, Gambling 3NT is a special of an opening of 3NT. The bid is used to describe a hand containing a minor suit of at least seven cards in length and headed by the ace, king and queen, at minimum. The bid has the dual objectives of preempting the opponents' bidding should they hold the and trying for a game in notrump on the gamble that partner might hold adequate support.
Because this conventional bid replaces the standard use of opening 3NT (a hand with 25-27 high card points and a balanced distribution), partnerships must use other bids to show the standard 3NT hand. For partnerships which also employ the use of the strong two club convention, that bid can be used to describe a standard 3NT opening hand. For example, the following bidding sequence:
replaces the traditional 3NT opening bid if gambling 3NT and strong two club is in use. That is, North's hand is best described as 25 to 27 high card points and a balanced distribution.
Responses.
Responses vary depending on the partnership agreement for stoppers in the side suits.
For the strong 3NT variant, the responder will normally pass unless holding a strong enough hand to envision a possible slam.
For the weak 3NT variant responder will:
Variations.
Partnership agreements vary as to whether the 3NT opening bid shows a side-suit ace or king. Originally, the convention required the opener to have stoppers in at least two of the side suits, now known as the Strong Gambling 3NT. The common current treatment is that the 3NT bidder shows weakness in the other suits and many play that it specifically denies any Aces or Kings in the side suits (in the first or second seat) – the Weak Gambling 3NT. Other variants include having at least one ace in a side suit or exactly two aces in the side suits.
Some partnerships play the following response variations:
Or alternatively
Defense.
A double by either opponent shows a strong hand which can expect to defeat 3NT with moderate help from partner, and invites partner to take out with some shape if the opponents run to their long suit.
If 3NT, doubled or otherwise, becomes the final contract, it is recommended that the opening lead be an ace, in order to see the dummy. A typical reason not to lead aces against other contracts is that it may give away a trick when declarer holds the king; here that is not possible. The reason that the ace "is" led is that the offense may have nine top tricks, and the defense must take its five first, without losing the lead.

<doc id="6961379" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6961379" title="Collar number">
Collar number

A collar number, also known as a shoulder number, force identification number (FIN) or occasionally as force number (although this can also refer to the ID number of a force itself), identifies police officers, police community support officers (PCSO), special constables (SC or SPC) and some police staff in UK police forces – other law enforcement agencies, such as HM Prison Service, have also adopted identification numbers. Although now displayed on epaulettes (i.e. on the shoulder), it is still commonly referred to as a collar number. Although most forces issue a collar number to all warranted officers regardless of role, only uniformed officers of the ranks constable and sergeant actually display the numbers.
In most forces it is simply a one- to five-digit number, but in larger forces a letter code (also known as a division call sign) may be added to indicate the officer's base area or unit. In some forces different types of staff (paid ('regular') police officers, special constables, PCSOs and other police staff) are assigned different ranges of numbers, so a person's role can be deduced from the number, but these systems are force specific and there is no national standard.
France.
In France, the wearing of the collar number is compulsory, save a few exceptions, from 1 January 2014.
Ireland.
Uniformed members of the Garda Síochána wear an epaulette, bearing their unique "shoulder number". In the Dublin Metropolitan Region the shoulder number starts with the letter of the district, while in the rest of the country, shoulder numbers begin with the letters of the division.
New Zealand.
Uniformed constables and sergeants of the New Zealand Police wear an epaulette, bearing their unique "registered number".
United Kingdom.
City of London.
Until recently, collar numbers consisted of a number followed by a single letter to indicate the division (e.g. "PC 123A").
In 1914, the force was reorganised into four divisions, each named after its police station:
Moor Lane Police Station was destroyed in the Blitz in 1940, and A Division was abolished and distributed amongst the three remaining divisions. Cloak Lane Police Station was closed down in 1946, and D Division was transferred to the new Wood Street Police Station. The divisions after 1946 therefore stood at:
In 1984, the force was reduced to two territorial divisions, based at Snow Hill Police Station and Bishopsgate Police Station (still B and C Divisions), together with support divisions, and the divisions subsequently stood at:
In February 2009, all the divisions were abolished and the force was divided into directorates (with all patrol officers falling within the new Territorial Policing Directorate, subsequently incorporating certain specialist units and becoming the Uniformed Policing Directorate). All officers' collar numbers were then suffixed by the letters "CP" rather than a divisional letter. In a fashion similar to the Metropolitan police,some units such as Traffic and the Support Group, have their collar number supplemented by either the T or U respectively in order to differentiate their additional training and skill set.
Collar numbers are allocated as follows:
Metropolitan Police.
A number, followed by one or two letters indicating the station/sector, borough, or unit. Current practice favours use of borough codes rather than station codes (with the borough code generally taken from one of the borough's stations—see below—which can cause confusion).
Divisional area codes are still used to identify the areas themselves, together with the police station and vehicles (if any) nominally covering them, but not officers.
A one, two or three digit number denotes a Sergeant, a three or four digit number denotes a Constable, a four digit number beginning with 5 denotes an officer of the Metropolitan Special Constabulary, unless they're attached to a 'Roads &amp; Transport Policing Command' (RTPC) team, in which case the number will begin with an 8 and a four digit number beginning with 7 denotes a PCSO again unless they are attached to RTPC and they will start with a 6. Confusingly, MPS epaulettes display the letters "over" the digits, i.e. 81FH (a Sergeant based at Hammersmith) would show FH over 81 on their shoulder, which reads more like FH81 (the call sign of a panda car based there). Ranks above Sergeant do not have collar numbers – officers are identified by name (e.g. Inspector Smith, who may once have been PC 123 kg Smith), or warrant number.
An exception to the above was the City of Westminster borough. Westminster had over 1,500 officers therefore a three digit number system was too small. Until late 2009 constables and sergeants had four digit shoulder numbers beginning 1, 2, 3 or 4 (with the leading number signifying which part of the borough you were attached to – 1 Westminster North, 2 Westminster Central, 3 Westminster South or 4 Westminster HQ). With the amalgamation of Westminster Central and South in late 2009 the decision was taken to amalgamate all the shoulder numbers into one numbering system. All new officers joining the borough were given the first available number and cross division moves no longer resulted in the need for a new shoulder number.
Frontline Policing.
From 2017 to 2019 the Metropolitan Police Service reformed the organisational structure of Frontline Policing from the existing 32 Borough Operational Command Units (BOCUs) into 12 new Basic Command Units.
† Some authoritative sources (e.g. "Police and Constabulary Almanac") are self-contradictory and incomplete.
Not all of these stations are currently operational.
Further to this; letters on shoulders will denote borough or newly formed basic command units and not the police station an officer is based from. An example of this would be a PC working from East Ham Police Station in the borough of Newham; the PC would have KF (Newham) on their shoulder and not KE (East Ham station). Similarly in newly merged boroughs a PC working from Holloway Police Station would have CN (Central North BCU) on their shoulder.
Sussex Police.
All officers will be provided with a collar number which is also their warrant number. Prior to September 2018, this was deemed by gender for example CS123 would represent a male officer whose surname started with S, a female would being with a D, DS123 for example.
The second letter would be the first initial of the officer, followed by a three digit number. In September 2018, this changed and all new officers warrant numbers start EA followed by a three digit number. Following the full use of the EA numbers from 1–999, they now start EB.
PNC codes and collar numbers.
When a police officer or a member of staff is in a collaborative (multi-constabulary) unit or department (such as the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit), the PNC code, which is a force identification number, is added to the collar number to prevent confusion between officers; e.g., 41-9999 would indicate a Hertfordshire officer. These numbers are only used in paperwork and are not seen on the officer's epaulettes.
HM Prison Service.
Operational Support Staff and sworn Prison Officers in His Majesty's Prison Service bear collar numbers to aid in accountability in the service. Collar numbers bear two letters indicating which establishment the officer is based at and three random numerical digits.
In fiction.
The collar number of George Dixon of Dixon of Dock Green was O 706.

Jane's Intelligence Review

Jane's Intelligence Review was a monthly journal on global security and stability issues published by Jane's Information Group. Its coverage includes international security issues, state stability, terrorism and insurgency, ongoing conflicts, organized crime, and weapons proliferation.
History.
"Jane's Soviet Intelligence Review" (1989–1991).
It was first published in January 1989 as "Jane's Soviet Intelligence Review", although a pilot edition had been produced in September the previous year and distributed at the Farnborough Airshow in order to test the market. Uniquely for Jane's—and its then parent company, the Thomson Corporation—the magazine carried no advertising but relied on subscription revenue only. It was profitable in its first year of publication and is believed to have remained profitable ever since. Among the first subscribers were the then vice-president of the United States, Dan Quayle, and the author Tom Clancy. Included in the January 1989 issue were articles on the Soviet 2S6 air-defence system, the Soviet Mi-24 helicopter and the new commanding general of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, Army General Stanislav Postnikov.
"Jane's Intelligence Review" (1991–present).
In 1991 in response to the breakup of the Warsaw Pact, the magazine changed its title to "Jane's Intelligence Review" although it had already expanded its coverage to include a special report on Iraq in October 1990 following that country's invasion of Kuwait.
In July 1993 it published what is thought to be the first open source reference to "Osameh bin Ladin" who "focused his activities on the military side of jihad and poured millions of dollars into training camps." In August 2001 it carried a cover feature on Al Qaeda which documented the "genesis, operational methods and organisational structure of the Bin Laden network.
It was also the source of some of the material plagiarized in the Blair government's infamous "Dodgy Dossier" concerning Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction.
The magazine in its current form focuses on a range of global security/stability issues, and includes regular features on international security, state stability, terrorism and insurgency, organised crime, and proliferation and procurement. These articles are written by a wide range of expert authors and on-the-ground correspondents.
"Jane's Intelligence Review" and "Jane's International Defence Review" were rolled into "Janes Defence and Intelligence Review".

Leaves Turn Inside You

Leaves Turn Inside You is the seventh and final studio album by the American post-hardcore band Unwound, released on April 17, 2001 by Kill Rock Stars.
The album received critical acclaim from several music publications, both contemporarily and after its original release, following later reissues by Numero Group. Marking the return of original drummer and co-founder Brandt Sandeno who had switched to keyboards and guitar, it is the band's only studio album to feature all four members.
Background and recording.
Unlike previous Unwound albums, "Leaves Turn Inside You" was recorded in 2000 by the band members at their own built studio, MagRecOne ("Magnetic Recording One"), in Olympia, Washington. Singer and guitarist Justin Trosper described the album as "a record that could stand as a final statement because there were already tremors preceding our impending earthquake." While developing the album in MagRecOne, the band had a newfound sense of creative freedom that broke away from their routine with the band's longtime producer and engineer Steve Fisk, with the album instead involving him as an instrumentalist. The album title came from a free association writing session held by Trosper, originally being the phrase "leaves turn inside me"; he was also "doing dream journals to work out ideas for lyrics so the whole album has dreamish gnostic quasi-religious themes throughout it".
Trosper said that he was mainly interested in "turning down the distortion and adding more textures and tones", and in using the recording studio as an instrument; he personally studied albums that were of interest to him at the time, including David Bowie's "Low", Public Image Ltd's "Metal Box", the Flaming Lips' "The Soft Bulletin", Radiohead's then-recently released "Kid A", Burzum's ambient music albums released while in prison, the Cure's "The Head on the Door", the sessions for the Beach Boys' "Smile", and "60s British stuff like The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and The Kinks." Along with idiosyncratic studio production including mic work, disorienting mixing and sound collages, the record features usage of the Mellotron and several ARP synthesizers. All songs were written and recorded by Unwound, with the production being handled between the three band members.
Release and packaging.
"Leaves Turn Inside You" was released as a double LP and double CD on April 17, 2001 by the independent record label Kill Rock Stars, which also released the band's previous five studio albums. The CD version is enhanced with two music videos: "Radio Gra" (by Slater Bradley) and "Scarlette" (by animator Zak Margolis). A promotional CD version on Matador Europe exists, which features the whole album on one CD, omitting the videos; it comes in a slimline jewelcase with a different cover art.
Music and lyrics.
"Leaves Turn Inside You" has been regarded as continuing down the stylistically exploratory path of "Repetition" and "Challenge for a Civilized Society". For instance, the song "Below the Salt" features delicate piano, heavy usage of reverb, and intimate, near-whispered vocals, while "Scarlette" brings back the band's hardcore punk origins. "Terminus" features cryptic lyrics and apocalyptic chamber orchestration. Drummer Sara Lund and Janet Weiss of sonic/geographic contemporaries Sleater-Kinney provide backing vocals on "Demons Sing Love Songs". The discs are titled "2" and "3", implying that "Challenge for a Civilized Society" is the first one.
According to "Treble"s Jeff Terich, the album saw Unwound disregard their former "noisy [and] pulsing" punk for "nuanced" art punk and shoegaze songcraft. He would go on to hail it "an avant-garde masterpiece". Sputnikmusic saw the group devote to "mellow" and "lyrically anxious" indie rock for its majority. They also summarized it as a "melancholic" fusion of dream pop, noise rock, and post-rock.
Critical reception.
"Leaves Turn Inside You" received critical acclaim. AllMusic reviewer Bryan Carroll described the album as "a unique, epic effort from one of the most inventive and dynamic rock bands in recent memory". Max Finneran, writing for "Spin", commented: "Rounding off the edges of its tried and true punk-rock grind with the melodic and rhythmic tropes of '60s psychedelia, Unwound has perfectly re-imagined a sound that most art-students wouldn't even spit on the first time around". "PopMatters" critic Matt Cibula stated that Unwound "plays with a tightness and richness that few bands can touch anymore; they have turned into the metal Minutemen". Camilo Arturo Leslie of "Pitchfork" wrote that he was "convinced that, if you've been following this band's development, the initial bewildered expression on your face will give way to total enchantment".
In "The Wire", Tom Ridge called the album a "radical departure in its scope and overall sound" from Unwound's previous works. According to Ridge, "the hardcore scene has spat out such individual classics at infrequent intervals, and "Leaves" sits comfortably alongside Hüsker Dü's "Zen Arcade", The Minutemen's "Double Nickels on the Dime" and Sonic Youth's "Daydream Nation"."
Legacy and impact.
"Leaves" status as a classic in post-hardcore music has solidified in recent years, with it being deemed arguably the best album in the genre. In 2015, Joe Banks of "The Quietus" wrote of its worthiness to stand as one of the genre's "great" double albums alongside "Zen Arcade" and "Daydream Nation". Also that year, the staff of "Treble" chose "Leaves" as one of 10 essential 21st century classics that would "[pave] the way for a whole new era" of future post-hardcore music. "Far Out"s Sam Kemp dubbed it one of the genre's definitive records in 2021.
In a 2014 "Quietus" article, Angus Andrew of experimental rock group Liars revealed "Leaves" to be one of his favorite records, calling it an "overwhelmingly complete and brave" entry in Unwound's "near flawless" discography. Noting their move towards an "exciting, challenging and experimental" sound, he dubbed the album a "giant stylistic leap of faith" that his band "took a large dose of influence" from.

<doc id="6961430" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6961430" title="Total correlation">
Total correlation

In probability theory and in particular in information theory, total correlation (Watanabe 1960) is one of several generalizations of the mutual information. It is also known as the "multivariate constraint" (Garner 1962) or "multiinformation" (Studený &amp; Vejnarová 1999). It quantifies the redundancy or dependency among a set of "n" random variables.
Definition.
For a given set of "n" random variables formula_1, the total correlation formula_2 is defined as the Kullback–Leibler divergence from the joint distribution formula_3 to the independent distribution of formula_4,
This divergence reduces to the simpler difference of entropies,
where formula_7 is the information entropy of variable formula_8, and formula_9 is the joint entropy of the variable set formula_1. In terms of the discrete probability distributions on variables formula_11, the total correlation is given by
The total correlation is the amount of information "shared" among the variables in the set. The sum formula_13 represents the amount of information in bits (assuming base-2 logs) that the variables would possess if they were totally independent of one another (non-redundant), or, equivalently, the average code length to transmit the values of all variables if each variable was (optimally) coded independently. The term formula_14 is the "actual" amount of information that the variable set contains, or equivalently, the average code length to transmit the values of all variables if the set of variables was (optimally) coded together. The difference between
these terms therefore represents the absolute redundancy (in bits) present in the given
set of variables, and thus provides a general quantitative measure of the
"structure" or "organization" embodied in the set of variables
(Rothstein 1952). The total correlation is also the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the actual distribution formula_15 and its maximum entropy product approximation formula_4.
Total correlation quantifies the amount of dependence among a group of variables. A near-zero total correlation indicates that the variables in the group are essentially statistically independent; they are completely unrelated, in the sense that knowing the value of one variable does not provide any clue as to the values of the other variables. On the other hand, the maximum total correlation (for a fixed set of individual entropies formula_17) is given by
and occurs when one of the variables determines "all" of the other variables. The variables are then maximally related in the sense that knowing the value of one variable provides complete information about the values of all the other variables, and the variables can be figuratively regarded as "cogs," in which the position of one cog determines the positions of all the others (Rothstein 1952).
It is important to note that the total correlation counts up "all" the redundancies among a set of variables, but that these redundancies may be distributed throughout the variable set in a variety of complicated ways (Garner 1962). For example, some variables in the set may be totally inter-redundant while others in the set are completely independent. Perhaps more significantly, redundancy may be carried in interactions of various degrees: A group of variables may not possess any pairwise redundancies, but may possess higher-order "interaction" redundancies of the kind exemplified by the parity function. The decomposition of total correlation into its constituent redundancies is explored in a number sources (Mcgill 1954, Watanabe 1960, Garner 1962, Studeny &amp; Vejnarova 1999, Jakulin &amp; Bratko 2003a, Jakulin &amp; Bratko 2003b, Nemenman 2004, Margolin et al. 2008, Han 1978, Han 1980).
Conditional total correlation.
Conditional total correlation is defined analogously to the total correlation, but adding a condition to each term. Conditional total correlation is similarly defined as a Kullback-Leibler divergence between two conditional probability distributions,
Analogous to the above, conditional total correlation reduces to a difference of conditional entropies,
Uses of total correlation.
Clustering and feature selection algorithms based on total correlation have been explored by Watanabe. Alfonso et al. (2010) applied the concept of total correlation to the optimisation of water monitoring networks.

Meliosma

Meliosma is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sabiaceae, native to tropical to warm temperate regions of southern and eastern Asia and the Americas. It is traditionally considered to contain about 100 species; some botanists take a much more conservative view accepting only 20-25 species as distinct. They are trees or shrubs, growing to 10–45 m tall.
Fossil evidence shows the genus formerly had a much wider range in the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and central Asia until the late Pliocene ice ages, and somewhat earlier in North America. At least 17 species of Meliosma are known from Peru.
The Indian awlking ("Choaspes benjaminii") is one of the Lepidoptera whose caterpillars feed on "Meliosma"; they have been found on "M. pungens", "rhoifolia", "M. rigida", and "M. squamulata".

River Conder

The River Conder is a river in the English county of Lancashire.
The source of the River Conder is a spring at Conder Head on Black Fell near Littledale, from where the stream briefly runs north, then west through Cragg Wood. The river then skirts around Quernmore in a southwesterly direction through a disproportionately wide valley, created by glacial action.
The river runs through Ellel and Galgate before turning to the north-west, flowing into the Lune estuary between Conder Green and Glasson Dock.
The river supplies most of the water for the Glasson Branch of the Lancaster Canal.
The name of the river was recorded in the 13th century as "Kondover" and "Kondoure", being derived from Brythonic and meaning "crooked waters".

The Other Boleyn Girl (2008 film)

The Other Boleyn Girl is a 2008 historical romantic drama film directed by Justin Chadwick. The screenplay by Peter Morgan was adapted from Philippa Gregory’s 2001 novel of the same name. 
It is a fictionalised account of the lives of 16th-century English aristocrats Mary Boleyn, mistress of King Henry VIII, and her sister, Anne, who became the monarch's ill-fated second wife.
The film was released on February 29th, 2008.
Plot.
Henry VIII of England's marriage to his brother's widow, Catherine of Aragon, has not produced a male heir. Their only surviving child is Princess Mary, whom Henry fears cannot successfully rule. Lady Mary Boleyn weds Sir William Carey, one of Henry's courtiers. 
Mary's maternal uncle, Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk and her father, Sir Thomas Boleyn, plot to install her older sister, Anne, as Henry's mistress to improve the family's status. Anne is promised an eventual marriage to a high-born nobleman. Anne accepts.
When Henry is injured in a hunting accident, he becomes smitten with Mary, who tends to his wounds. This grants the Boleyns a prominent place at court. Mary and Anne become ladies-in-waiting to Queen Catherine while William Carey is sent abroad as an ambassador. 
The King seduces Mary, who becomes his mistress. Anne secretly marries her lover Henry Percy, a nobleman betrothed to Lady Mary Talbot. When her brother, George, learns about the marriage, he informs Mary. Matrimony among nobles must first be approved by the king. To protect Anne, Mary alerts their father and uncle, who have the union annulled. Anne is sent to France to learn court manners.
When Mary becomes pregnant with Henry's child, Sir Thomas leverages this to obtain lands and positions for himself and his family. George is unhappily betrothed to Lady Jane Parker. When Mary is confined to bedrest during her pregnancy, Norfolk recalls Anne to distract Henry from seeking another mistress. 
Resentful that Henry initially preferred her sister, Anne beguiles him by refusing his advances. Mary gives birth to her and Henry's son, but Anne diverts his attention. This irritates Norfolk until Anne reveals her ambitions to be queen and produce a legitimate male heir. She continues refusing Henry's advances, promising to accept if he stops bedding Catherine and speaking to Mary. Shortly afterwards, Mary and her child are exiled to the countryside with the returning Carey, who soon dies of illness.
Anne pressures Henry to break from the Catholic Church when Pope Clement VII refuses to allow him to divorce Catherine. Henry learns rumors of Anne's marriage to Percy; Mary is returned to court but assures him the rumors are false. She stays at Anne's urging.
Henry declares himself Supreme Head of the "Church of England", grants his own divorce, and banishes Catherine to her native Spain. When Anne refuses to consummate their relationship before they are legally married, he, overcome with rage and lust, rapes her. Despite being deeply traumatized, the now pregnant Anne marries Henry and is crowned England's new queen consort.
Anne gives birth to a daughter, Elizabeth. Henry, disappointed he still has no male heir, secretly courts Jane Seymour. Anne is deeply hated by the English people, and she develops paranoia as her marriage collapses.
After miscarrying a son, Anne fears for her life and begs George to impregnate her. He agrees but cannot go through with it. Unbeknownst to them, his spying wife Jane reports her suspicions to Norfolk and the King. Anne and George are both arrested on charges of incest, adultery and high treason. 
Despite a lack of evidence, both are hastily convicted and sentenced to death. Mary begs Henry to spare Anne, and he seemingly agrees out of kindness toward her. The sisters reconcile, and Anne requests that Mary raise Elizabeth as her own.
Mary receives a secret letter from Henry, instructing her not to return to court. Despite Henry's earlier promise, Anne is executed so he can lawfully marry Jane Seymour. Mary watches in despair as Anne is beheaded.
Sir Thomas died two years after the executions; Norfolk was later disgraced and imprisoned, and the next three generations of the Howard family were executed for treason; Mary remarried to William Stafford and spent the remainder of her life living in the country; Elizabeth went on to rule England for over forty years as Queen Elizabeth I.
Production.
Much of the filming took place in Kent, England, though Hever Castle was not used, despite being the original household of Thomas Boleyn and family from 1505 to 1539. The Baron's Hall at Penshurst Place featured, as did Dover Castle, which stood in for the Tower of London in the film, and Knole House in Sevenoaks was used in several scenes. The home of the Boleyns was represented by Great Chalfield Manor in Wiltshire, and other scenes were filmed at locations in Derbyshire, including Cave Dale, Haddon Hall, Dovedale and North Lees Hall near Hathersage.
Dover Castle was transformed into the Tower of London for the execution scenes of George and Anne Boleyn. Knole House was the setting for many of the film's London night scenes and the inner courtyard doubles for the entrance of Whitehall Palace where the grand arrivals and departures were staged. The Tudor Gardens and Baron's Hall at Penshurst Place were transformed into the interiors of Whitehall Palace, including the scenes of Henry's extravagant feast.
Historical accuracy.
Historian Alex von Tunzelmann criticised "The Other Boleyn Girl" for its portrayal of the Boleyn family and Henry VIII, citing factual errors. She stated, "In real life, by the time Mary Boleyn started her affair with Henry, she had already enjoyed a passionate liaison with his great rival, King François I of France. Rather ungallantly, François called her 'my hackney', explaining that she was fun to ride. Chucked out of France by his irritated wife, Mary sashayed back to England and casually notched up her second kingly conquest. The film's portrayal of this Boleyn girl as a shy, blushing damsel could hardly be further from the truth." She further criticised the depiction of Anne as a "manipulative vixen" and Henry as "nothing more than a gullible sex addict in wacky shoulder pads". The film presents other historical inaccuracies, such as the statement by a character that, through marrying Henry Percy, Anne Boleyn would become Duchess of Northumberland, a title that was only created in the reign of Henry's son, Edward VI. Also, it places Anne's time in the French court after her involvement with Percy, something that occurred before the affair. On top of that, Anne was portrayed inaccurately as the older sister in the movie, in real life she was Mary's younger sister.
In the film, Thomas Boleyn stated Anne was in France for a couple of months. In real life, Anne was in France for seven years.
Release.
Theatrical.
The film was first released in theatres on February 29, 2008, though its world premiere took place at the 58th Berlin International Film Festival held February 7–17, 2008. The film earned $9,442,224 in the United Kingdom, and $26,814,957 in the United States and Canada. The combined worldwide gross of the film was $75,598,644, more than double the film's $35 million budget.
Home media.
The film was released in Blu-ray and DVD formats on June 10, 2008. Extras on both editions include an audio commentary with director Justin Chadwick, deleted and extended scenes, character profiles, and featurettes. The Blu-ray version includes BD-Live capability and an additional picture-in-picture track with character descriptions, notes on the original story, and passages from the original book.
Critical reception.
The film received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 43%, based on 148 reviews, with a weighted average of 5.30/10. The site's general consensus is: "Though it features some extravagant and entertaining moments, "The Other Boleyn Girl" feels more like a soap opera than historical drama." Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 50 out of 100, based on 34 reviews.
Manohla Dargis of "The New York Times" called the film "more slog than romp" and an "oddly plotted and frantically paced pastiche." She added, "The film is both underwritten and overedited. Many of the scenes seem to have been whittled down to the nub, which at times turns it into a succession of wordless gestures and poses. Given the generally risible dialogue, this isn’t a bad thing."
Mick LaSalle of the "San Francisco Chronicle" said, "This in an enjoyable movie with an entertaining angle on a hard-to-resist period of history ... Portman's performance, which shows a range and depth unlike anything she's done before, is the No. 1 element that tips "The Other Boleyn Girl" in the direction of a recommendation ... [She] won't get the credit she deserves for this, simply because the movie isn't substantial enough to warrant proper attention."
Peter Travers of "Rolling Stone" stated, "The film moves in frustrating herks and jerks. What works is the combustible teaming of Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson, who give the Boleyn hotties a tough core of intelligence and wit, swinging the film's sixteenth-century protofeminist issues handily into this one."
Peter Bradshaw of "The Guardian" awarded the film three out of five stars, describing it as a "flashy, silly, undeniably entertaining Tudor romp" and adding, "It is absurd yet enjoyable, and playing fast and loose with English history is a refreshing alternative to slow and tight solemnity; the effect is genial, even mildly subversive ... It is ridiculous, but imagined with humour and gusto: a very diverting gallop through the heritage landscape."
Sukhdev Sandhu of "The Telegraph" said, "This is a film for people who prefer their costume dramas to gallop along at a merry old pace rather than get bogged down in historical detail ... Mining relatively familiar material here, and dramatising highly dubious scenarios, [Peter Morgan] is unable to make the set-pieces seem revelatory or tart ... In the end, "The Other Boleyn Girl" is more anodyne than it has any right to be. It can't decide whether to be serious or comic. It promises an erotic charge that it never carries off, inducing dismissive laughs from the audience for its soft-focus love scenes soundtracked by swooning violins. It is tasteful but unappetising."
Potential sequel.
Production studio BBC Films also owns the rights to adapt the 2006 sequel novel, "The Boleyn Inheritance", which tells the story of Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard and Jane Parker.

The Garin Death Ray

The Garin Death Ray, also known as The Death Box and The Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin (), is a science fiction novel by the noted Russian author Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy written in 1926–1927. 
The "hyperboloid" in its title is not a geometrical surface (though it is utilized in the device design) but a "death ray"-laser-like device (thought up by the author many decades before lasers were invented) that the protagonist, engineer Garin, used to fight his enemies and try to become the dictator of the world. The idea of a "death ray" (popularized in "The War of the Worlds" by H. G. Wells, among others) was commonplace in science fiction of the time, but Tolstoy's version is unique for its level of technical details. "Hyperboloids" of different power capability differ in their effect. The device uses two hyperbolic mirrors (in contrast to Wells's Heat-Ray, which uses a parabolic mirror) to concentrate light rays in a parallel beam. Larger "hyperboloids" can destroy military ships on the horizon, and those of less power can only injure people and cut electric cables on walls of rooms.
Professor , an expert in optics, in his 1944 book "О возможном и невозможном в оптике" ("About Possible and Impossible in Optics") presented arguments about the infeasibility of Garin's device.
Adaptations.
Two film adaptations of the novel were released in the Soviet Union in 1965 ("The Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin") and 1973 ("Failure of Engineer Garin").
Aleksandr Abdulov started shooting his own version of "Hyperboloid", but it was unfinished due to Abdulov's illness and death.

Total Terror

Total Terror is the second of two self-released cassette tapes by industrial music band Front Line Assembly. At this point, Bill Leeb was the band's only dedicated member, with some help from Rhys Fulber.
Background.
After the second demo cassette Michael Balch became a member of Front Line Assembly. It also paved the way for a release on a label since the band received offers from several labels to record an album.
Release.
The album was mostly remastered and rereleased on CD in 1993 as "Total Terror I", and followed up by a companion collection of same-period demos, "Total Terror II", a year later. These have been collected into "Complete Total Terror". 
In Germany, both CDs were released 1993 by now defunct label Dossier.
Polish label Mecanica issued vinyl editions of both albums in summer 2002, together with bonus tracks from other sessions and compilations.
In 2004, Cleopatra reissued "Total Terror I" and "Total Terror II" in a two-CD package, with new cover art, under the title "Complete Total Terror". Despite its name, it does not include "Eternal".
Cleopatra re-released the albums as part of a box set, "Permanent Data 1986–1989", on CD and digitally on August 19, 2022, with bonus tracks including "Eternal". All albums in the set were remastered by Jürgen Engler of German industrial metal group Die Krupps.
"Total Terror I".
Most of the original cassette was later remastered and commercially released on CD in 1993 as Total Terror I (fully titled Total Terror Part I: Official Demos 1986) on Cleopatra Records and Dossier. It does not include "Eternal", which remains unreleased on CD or vinyl, but added three previously-unreleased bonus tracks from other sessions in 1986: "Freedom", "Distorted Vision" and "Cleanser".
The German release gave some explanations about the production and the reason for the release on the back cover:
"Total Terror II".
Total Terror II, a collection of 1986–1987 remastered Front Line Assembly demos, was released on Cleopatra Records in 1994, fulfilling the promise latent in the title of the previous year's "Total Terror I". It included 13 previously-unreleased tracks:

Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover

The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover () is a Lutheran church body "(Landeskirche)" in the northern German state of Lower Saxony and the city of Bremerhaven covering the territory of the former Kingdom of Hanover.
The seat of the Landesbischof (bishop) is the Lower Saxon state capital Hanover. The Marktkirche is the preaching venue of the bishop.
Creeds and memberships.
The teachings of the Church of Hanover are based on the teachings brought forward by Martin Luther during the Reformation. The Church of Hanover is a full member of the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD), the Confederation of Protestant Churches in Lower Saxony, the United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany (VELKD), the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe and the Lutheran World Federation.
History.
Before the formation of the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover in 1863/1864, there were several regional Protestant churches earlier established by and within the borders of previous principalities and regions, combined as the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814. These churches were:
All these churches were state churches in the Kingdom of Hanover, with the king being "summus episcopus" (Supreme Governor of the Lutheran churches), but otherwise without any joint bodies. In 1848 the Lutheran parishes were democratised by the introduction of presbyteries (, sg./pl.; lit. in ), elected by all major male parishioners and chairing each congregation in co-operation with the pastor, prior being the sole chairman. This introduction of presbyteries was somewhat revolutionary in the rather hierarchically structured Lutheran churches.
Whereas liberal Lutherans demanded the establishment of elected synods (general or regional church assemblies) too, feeling encouraged by the general development of parliamentarianism, the revivalist Lutherans strove for self-rule within the Lutheran churches in order to strengthen religion and faith against the government's interference in ecclesiastical affairs, considered by them as too rationalistic and too much inspired by ideas of the enlightenment. So liberal and revivalist Lutherans aimed at forming an ecclesiastical body, as provided by the 1833 constitution of Hanover, consisting of elected and appointed clergy and laymen.
Especially the catechism used since 1790 was unwelcome among revivalists as being too much inspired by ideas of the Enlightenment. So the Royal government, more precisely its ministry of cult and education, prepared a catechism reform to be prepared by government-appointed experts. The outcome was a new catechism, based on that of 1634, and on 14 April 1862 decreed by the government. If the outcome would have been less controversial the royal administration might have had the opportunity to continue its church policy the monarchic supreme-governor way. However, the new old-style catechism, including regular confession, desired by King George V, but meanwhile widely out of use and considered among many liberal Lutherans as too Catholic and un-Protestant, caused an outrage, the Hanover Catechism Strife, surprising the Royal administration.
Inspired by the protest note "Prüfet Alles" (about ) by Pastor , later nicknamed the "Luther of the Wendland", a movement evolved. When summoned by the Hanover Consistory in order to explain himself, a crowd of thousand accompanied him through the streets of that city and military was sent suppressing any gathering and subsequent street riots in town.
George V gave in, he dismissed his minister of cult, finally even his complete cabinet and, under the tensions occurring, he withdrew the reformed catechism. George V agreed to get the catechism reform revised by an ecclesiastical body formed according to the 1833 constitution. In autumn 1862 the new minister of cult, (term: 1862–1865), convened this body, called the "Vorsynode" (i.e. proto-synod, a preliminary church legislative assembly), comprising 72 members, 64 elected, eight appointed, half of them clergy, the others laymen. The proto-synod met and negotiated several times until 6 October 1863, becoming the founding body of the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover, uniting synodals from all the seven existing old Lutheran state churches in the kingdom.
Its then 72 male members were to design a church constitution, including the regulations as to the synod. The formation of the Church of Hanover was thus started by defining all the then existing Lutheran congregations in the kingdom as part of the to-be-represented church electorate. In October 1864 the Estates Assembly of Hanover (the parliament Ständeversammlung) adopted the first law, outlined by the proto-synod, as to the constitution of the all-Hanoverian Lutheran state church, its component subdivisions (dioceses and jurisdictions), and its legislative state synod (; historically state synod is the correct translation, as to the post-1918 function, without state churches anymore, regional synod is more appropriate).
After the Prussian conquest in 1866, on 19 September 1866, the day before the official Prussian annexation took place and with the last king, George V, already in exile, the Kingdom's six government-appointed consistories established the joint all-Hanoveran state consistory ("Landeskonsistorium"), based in Hanover too, consisting of representatives from each provincial consistory. The provincial consistories were in Aurich, a simultaneously Lutheran and Reformed consistory dominated by Lutherans (for East Frisia) and the Lutheran consistories in Hanover (for the former Electorate of Brunswick and Lunenburg proper), in Ilfeld (for the County of Hohenstein, a Hanoverian exclave in the Eastern Harz mountains), in Osnabrück (for the former Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück), in Otterndorf (existed 1535-1885 for the Land of Hadeln) as well as in Stade (existed 1650-1903, until 1885 for the former Bremen-Verden proper without Hadeln, then including the complete Stade Region). Thus with the Church of Hanover the elected state synod came first and the formation of a steady nationwide executive, the "Landeskonsistorium" (state consistory) followed as the second step in 1866.
The first ordinary state synod (Landessynode), succeeding the proto-synod, only convened in 1869, when after the Prussian annexation the Hanoverian Lutherans desired a representative body separate from Prussian rule, though it was restricted to Lutheran matters only. The Church of Hanover became a stronghold of Hanoverian separatism and therefore somewhat politicised. It opposed the Prussian Union, comprising the Protestant parishes in the Prussian territory prior the 1866 annexations, not only for its being a stronghold of Prussian patriotism, but for being a united church of Lutheran and Calvinist congregations, with a preponderance of Calvinism because the Calvinist Hohenzollern dynasty wielded its influence in the unification of Lutherans and Calvinists in then Prussia in 1817.
The Hanoverian Lutherans managed to maintain their independence, with the Prussian government refraining from imposing the Prussian Union onto them. The reconciliation of the Lutheran majority of the citizens in annexed Hanover with their new Prussian citizenship was not to be further complicated by religious quarrels. Until 1903 all provincial consistories except for the one in Aurich were dissolved, their functions taken over by the state consistory.
The Weimar Constitution of 1919 provided for the separation of state and religion. After the system of state churches had disappeared with the monarchies in the German states, the question arose why the Protestant church bodies within Germany did not merge. Besides the smaller Protestant denominations of the Mennonites, Baptists or Methodists, which were organised across state borders along denominational lines, in 1922 there were 29 (later 28) church bodies organised along territorial borders of the German states or Prussian provinces.
In fact, a merger was permanently under discussion, but never materialised due to strong regional self-confidence and traditions as well as the denominational fragmentation into Lutheran, Calvinist (Reformed) and United and uniting churches. Following the Swiss example of 1920, the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover and 28 other territorially defined German Protestant churches founded the German Evangelical Church Confederation in 1922, which was no new merged church, but a loose federation of the existing independent church bodies. In 1922 the Church of Hanover counted 2,414,000 parishioners.
Since the adoption of the Leuenberg Agreement in 1973 the Church of Hanover practises church fellowship with many non-Lutheran Protestant churches in Germany and the world, understood as pulpit and table fellowship as well as full communion in witness and service.
After Margot Käßmann's resignation as bishop in February 2010, Hans-Hermann Jantzen served as vicar (acting bishop) until Ralf Meister's investiture as her successor on 26 March 2011.
Practices.
Ordination of women and blessing of same-sex marriages were allowed.
Today's subdivisions.
The Church of Hanover is divided into 6 dioceses of land districts (German: Sprengel) in which a regional bishop presides:
Each district is in turn divided into smaller deaneries (), each of which is led by a superintendent. The 56 deaneries are divided into 1320 parishes.
Bodies.
The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover has six constitutional bodies, these are the Bishop, the Church Senate, the Synode, the Territorial Synodal Committee, the Church Office and the Council of Bishops.
Synod.
The Synode (Landessynode, i.e. historically state synod is the correct translation, as to the post-1918 situation, without state churches anymore, regional synod is the more appropriate translation) is the parliament of the Church. Since 1869 the Landessynode was elected for three year terms, with the interruption - due to the Struggle of the Churches between 1934 and 1946.
Today the members of the "Synod", the synodals, are elected every six years in constituencies. Today's Landessynode comprises 75 synodals, 63 elected, ten appointed by the church senate, one delegated by the Lutheran theological faculty of the George Augustus University in Göttingen and the Abbot of Loccum, as an ex officio member.
The "Synod" meets twice a year. Its duties are similar to those of political parliaments. The "Landessynodalausschuss" (synodal committee) is the elected steady board representing the synod between synodal meetings. President of the "Synod" is Matthias Kannengiesser.
Bishop.
Since its new constitution of 1925, accounting for the separation of religion and state by the Weimar Constitution (1919), the Head of the Church of Hanover is the bishop (Landesbischof) who is elected by the Synod. The bishop usually retires at the age of 65. Until 1918 there was supreme governorship (summepiscopacy) by the respective monarch, whereas the actual executive of the church (Landeskonsistorium) was led by its presidents, competent to sign contracts of the church.
The bishop also has his or her headquarters in Hanover, the Marktkirche there is the bishop's preaching venue. The Bishop is chairman of the College in the church office (see below).
"Bischofsrat" (council of Bishops).
On all matters concerning ecclesiastical life, the "Bischofsrat" consults at regular meetings. It consists of the Landesbischof (bishop) of the Church of Hannover and the regional bishop, the spiritual heads of today's six dioceses (Sprengel). The Bischofsrat is in charge of recommending agendas, hymn books and catechisms.
Church Senate.
Another important body is the Church Senate (Kirchensenat). It is the steady directing collegial body combining the bishop, the president of the church office, the president of the synod, the president of the synodal committee, one clerical member of the Church Office, one of the six regional bishops, three synodals, and four other members of the Church of Hanover (but not synodals).
The Church Senate prepares bills and may issue ordinances within the scope of church laws passed by the synod. The church senate proposes up to three candidates for the bishop elections, it appoints the regional bishops and supervises them, it appoints ten members of the synod, it appoints the presidents and vice-presidents of the church office, chooses the Church of Hanover delegates for the Protestant Church in Germany meetings, it demarks the competences of the bishop, the regional bishops, and the church office.
Church Office.
The Regional Church Office (German: Landeskirchenamt Hannover) is the administrative center of the Church of Hanover.
The Bishop is chairman of the College in the church office (or less the "government" of the Church), which includes, besides the bishop, the president of the Church Office, the Spiritual Vice President (since 2006: ), the Legal Vice President ( since 2002: )) and the theological and legal supreme regional church councillors (German: Oberlandeskirchenräte). There are currently (2008) 210 employees working in the Church Office.
Mission.
The Evangelical-Lutheran Mission in Lower Saxony (ELM), which was founded in 1977 as a common organisation for the Churches of Hanover, of Brunswick and of Schaumburg-Lippe, maintains relationships with the overseas partner churches of the Hanoverian regional church. Its history dates back to 1849 when Pastor Ludwig Harms began training the first missionaries. The headquarters of the ELM is in Hermannsburg in the "Südheide".
"Haus kirchlicher Dienste" ( House of Church Services).
The "Haus kirchlicher Dienste" (since 2002) (House of Church Services), founded in September 1937 as "Amt für Gemeindedienst" (Office for congregational services) are the service and competence center for the Church of Hanover and supports the work of the Church of Hannover and the parishes. The house provides facilities and agencies for work areas in the Church of Hanover. In 2011, the House of Church Services had 200 employees. The House of Church Services also includes the Hanns-Lilje-House () and the Bursfelde Abbey.
The departments are:
in cooperation with the Confederation of Protestant churches in Lower Saxony:
religious associations:
Church Office Hanover:
In addition, sections of the Evangelical Media Service Centre
Director.
The Director is the Chairman of the Executive Committee (Former: Leadership Conference), which, in addition to the directors, the CEO, the head of the department and the pedagogical head of Protestant adult education in Lower Saxony (Ev. Erwachsenenbildung Niedersachsen) be a member of.
From 1979 to 2002, the director of the Office of Congregational Service (now: House of Church Services) was the Commissioner for the Environment of the Confederation of Protestant Churches in Lower Saxony.
Institutions of the Church.
In Loccum, the church maintains a Protestant academy and a theological seminary, which is located in the Loccum Abbey. Other facilities are the Religion Pedagogical Institute, the Center for Health Ethics (German: Zentrum für Gesundheitsethik) and the Hanns-Lilje Foundation ().

El Tigre

El Tigre is a city of Anzoategui, a state located east of Venezuela's capital city of Caracas.
Located in what is called the "Guanipa Mesa", a river (Tigre) runs across the city.
The average temperature is 79°F, all year around, and the annual average rainfall is 1,200mm. One nearby tourist destination is the Chimire Cliffs.
El Tigre also is in full conurbation with the city of San Jose de Guanipa also known as El Tigrito, capital of the Guanipa Municipality whose population according to data from the CNE is "84,526 " inhabitants. Both cities are basically one, whose population would be "291,472 " inhabitants.
Since the appointment of Orinoco Belt as one of the largest reserves of oil in the world, El Tigre has become one of the most important cities in Venezuela because it is very near or on the edge of this oil belt in Anzoategui state. Thus, El Tigre currently shows an increase in the establishment of companies of services to the oil industry that is constantly growing and have also been presented innumerable construction projects for new shopping malls, business buildings or towers and other works for the significant activation of tourism.
History.
In the 1930s a large field of light crude oil was discovered near El Tigrito by the Mene Grande Oil Company (MGO), a subsidiary of Gulf Oil Corporation. The Oficina No. 1 well, a wildcat well begun in 1933 and completed in 1937, established the highly productive Oficina Formation. The oil discovery led to the founding of El Tigre on February 23, 1933 when Mene Grande established their offices in Campo Oficina. El Tigre quickly became a boomtown. The name "Oficina" (Office) was derived from the telegraph office in El Tigrito. Until the oil discovery, the area had been sparsely populated. By 1940 a road and an oil pipeline had been constructed to connect El Tigre with Puerto La Cruz. By 1946, 512 wells had been drilled, and the region had produced 127 million barrels of oil. The nearby oil company camp San Tomé was built near El Tigre as the main camp for Mene Grande.
Demographics.
The Simón Rodríguez Municipality, according to the 2011 Venezuelan census, has a population of 194,858 inhabitants (went up from 155,178 in 2000). This amounts to 12.4% of Anzoátegui's population.
Geography.
Limits.
About the territorial extension of the municipality in which the city is located, it is 702 km2 and delimited by the following territories:
Northeast: borders the municipalities Pedro Maria Freites and Guanipa.
South: bordering the municipality Francisco de Miranda.
East: borders the municipality Guanipa.
West: bordering the municipality Francisco de Miranda.
Southeast: municipalities bordering Guanipa and Independencia.
Climate.
The climate is of savannah and temperatures ranging between 68 °F (20 degrees C) and 96.8 °F (37 degrees C), with an average of 80.6 °F (27 degrees C) approximately.
Media.
Radio.
La Voz de EL Tigre it was the first radio station in amplitude modulated (AM) installed in the city, by Don Carlos Poleo, January 9, 1948.
With the development of the frequency modulation (FM) are many radio stations that have been installed, among the most representative.
Government.
El Tigre is the shire town of the Simón Rodríguez Municipality in Anzoátegui. The mayor of the Simón Rodríguez Municipality is Ernesto Raydan, elected in 2017 with 51.95% of the votes.

Malietoa Talavou Tonumaipeʻa

Le Susuga Malietoa Talavou Tonumaipea ( - November 9, 1880) was installed as "King" of Samoa to the western world on August 28, 1879, until his death on November 9, 1880. Since Malietoa Talavou's half brother's (same father M. Vai'inupo) death, Malietoa Moli in 1860, ongoing wars due to power and authority struggle between Talavou and Laupepa (M. Talavou's nephew-his half brother M. Moli's eldest son) over the next Malietoa title holder and the gaining of support by the districts of Samoa. Family rivalry existed as did a 30-year age difference drew a wedge between Malietoa Laupepa and Malietoa Talavou. They were known to be longtime rivals over the Malietoa title.
Since the death of M. Moli in 1860, the people of Samoa were undecided in their allegiance to one Malietoa title holder. In 1869, Talavou was conferred the Malietoa title by the majority of the districts (Faasalelega, Manono, parts of Tuamasaga to Mulinuʻu. This included people from Leulumoega and Lufilufi) all of whom were against Laupepa's claim to the Malietoa title. Also in 1869, Laupepa was strongly supported by the majority in the Tuamasaga district. Both Talavou and Laupepa jointly held the Malietoa title until their deaths.
At the end of Malietoa Gatuitasina's (M Moli and M Talavou's uncle) reign and death in 1858, the Malietoa title did not transition downward in its normal traditional order of succession by generation, age and seniority. M. Talavou should have succeeded M. Moli because they were in the same generation and M. Laupepa was in the next generation. M. Moli and M. Talavou are also half brothers (same father M. Vai'inupo).
M. Moli reigned for two years 1858-1860 and died in 2 years after M. Gatuitasina's death on October 1, 1858.
Malietoa Laupepa was installed as "King" in 1875 then four years later Malietoa Talavou was finally proclaimed and appointed as "King" in his latter years on August 28, 1879, officially recognized on record by the German, British and American governments. Malietoa Talavou was born to Malietoa Vai'inupo Tavita, by his second wife Fuataiotuimaleali'ifano Malietoa Muagututi'a (also known as Malietoa Ti'a). It was reported, in a local newsletter, that Malietoa Talavou died on November 9, 1880 (at the age of 70). No official record of Malietoa Talavou's cause of death.
Early and family life.
Talavou (which means "young" or "energetic" in Samoan) was born in Sāpapāli‘i, Savai'i, Samoa sometime around the year 1810. He lived most of his life on Savai‘i where he commissioned the construction of his "tulaga maota" named Pouesi ("Papaya-wood Post"). A modern ceremonial meetinghouse now stands on the Pouesi land which is considered the crownland of Talavou's modern descendants, collectively known as the Sā Talavou. Talavou's tenure as Malietoa was filled with warfare, religious partisanship, and political maneuvering (including marriage-alliances). He had five wives:
(1) Talavou's first wife was Fa‘amelea; a daughter of Lei‘ataualesā Malulaufai of Faleu, Manono. Kraemer claims her father was Malulaufa‘i, the brother of Taimalelagi Lei‘ataua. Fa‘alataolefuaaleaigailetai [Fa‘alataitaua, Fa‘alataaloali‘i ] was the son of this couple who went on to become Malietoa, Seiuliali‘i and Ta‘imua. He was installed as the next Mataafa by Mataafa Iosefo the 'Alii Sili' during the German Rule in Samoa (1900 - 1914).
(2) Talavou's second wife was [Taemanea Falenaoti, this woman was known as Mataouli as mentioned by Dr. Kramer] the daughter of the high chief [Sala Lenuanua] of Lealatele Savai’i. The couple had three children, a son named Tapu (Tapuulafiti) and 2 daughters Taofimalo (Taofimaloafiafiovasa) and Fuatai (Fuataiotui). Tapuulafiti married [Taele] the daughter of [Leta'a Uipo] of Apia, they had a son who acquired the titles [Papali'i Taimalelagi Tuiletufuga]. Taofimalo married [Tevaga Akalemo Filipo] of Lealatele. They had a son, [Tevaga Milo Filipo] and a daughter [Malia Taliilagi Filipo].
(2) (3) Third wife Tu‘ua was the daughter of chief Taliaoa from Afega, Tuamasaga and the mother of a daughter named Ali‘itasi.
(4) An unnamed woman from Si‘umu is listed as a fourth wife who bore a child named Mu, although accounts are inconsistent as to whether this child was a male or female.
(5) The details of the fifth wife are unknown.
Military involvement.
Talavou's appetite for war and talent for victory were developed early in his life under the tutelage of his father Vai‘inupō and his uncle Taimalelagi. He was already leading his own war parties in 1830 and had gained a feared reputation while still a young man. Talavou was often called Malietoa Pe‘a because he received the influential Tonumaipe‘a title shortly after Tamafaigā's death. Kraemer wrote that Manono assisted him in “wresting” the title from Sātupa‘itea (Kraemer I:320) but Tuiatua Tupua Tamasese Tupuola Efi asserts that the Tonumaipe‘a came to Talavou at “the instigation of Manono” through his arranged marriage to “a lady of Tamafaigā’s family" (Efi 1995).
Religious affiliations.
Talavou's first association with Christianity was through John Williams (missionary) and the London Missionary Society. Talavou was one of Vai‘inupō's sons mentioned by Williams as having accepted the Lotu without Vai‘inupō's permission in 1832. Talavou abruptly ended his affiliation with the L.M.S. in 1842 when Taimalelagi turned against the Christians (Meleiseā 1987a:74-77). Taimalelagi remained anti-Christian until his death but Talavou later attached himself to the Wesleyan [Methodist] sect “through his Tongan kin” (Meleiseā 1987b:239). Talavou was one of the first Samoan missionaries of the L.M.S. and he may have become an active advocate of Methodism as well. Talavou was a keen student and statesman who was highly respected by resident Europeans on account of his dignified and friendly demeanor, not to mention his impressive command of both the English and Samoan languages. On account of his linguistic proficiencies and religious interest he was also commissioned to assist in the translation of the Holy Bible into the Samoan language. This “excellent” translation took place between 1835 and 1845 (Masterman 30) but Talavou probably only actively participated in the first seven years of translation process.
Since the Malietoa and Lei‘ataua families were related to and allied with the ruling families of Tonga it was politically favorable that Talavou take up the religion of his supporters. Since Talavou was unsuccessful in rallying all of Samoa behind his mālō, the espousal of the Methodist denomination may have been designed to provide a unified religious front in opposition to the Sā Mōlī's L.M.S. faction. Talavou's conversion to the Lotu Toga also emphasizes political connections with Tonga which are often overlooked. European accounts from the 1770s reveal that Samoa and Tonga were actively engaged in interisland travel, warfare, chiefly intermarriage, and political affairs. King Siaosi [George] Tupou Tāufa‘āhau of Tonga had staunchly supported the Methodist cause taken up by Manono, which was the home island of his Samoan wife Sālata. Tāufa‘āhau and the Tu‘i Kanokupolu establishment were deeply involved in Manono politics and it is likely that his support was held in high regard by the Malietoa faction as well.
Talavou defected from the L.M.S. and joined himself to the Lotu Toga in 1842, perhaps in conjunction with a Tongan alliance formalized with Tonga during Tāufa‘āhau's visit in that same year. Sioeli [Joel] Tupou and Peniamina [Benjamin] Latūselu were both Methodist preachers of noble Tongan ancestry who were noted for their involvement in Manono religious and political spheres of the time. Certainly there were many genuine converts to Christianity, but ulterior political motives cannot be ignored as the impetus for many religious conversions during this time period. Like his father, it seems that Talavou's professions of Christianity were more of a socio-political tactic than a spiritual conversion, especially since he continued to defy basic Christian tenets regarding plural marriage and warfare until his death.
Family rivalry.
After Mōlī's death, the Sā Malietoa was torn along religious and geopolitical lines: Savai‘i, Manono, parts of Tuamasaga and the Methodists (including Tongan Wesleyans) were behind the Sā Talavou while Malie, the rest of Tuamasaga, and the L.M.S. congregationalists remained loyal to Laupepa. The Gato‘aitele and Tamasoāli‘i were conferred upon To‘oā Sualauvī who was to serve as temporary guardian of the titles until the “official” Malietoa was chosen and installed. Even though Talavou was a seasoned leader and feared warrior, Malie authorities opposed his leadership because of the loss of prestige his mālō had suffered at the hands of the British who had bombarded Sāgone and Palauli in 1859. The leaders of Savai‘i and ‘Āiga i le Tai opposed the nomination of Laupepa because of his youth and lack of experience in leadership and war. It was also argued that the customary practice called toe o le uso, “the right of the remaining brother,” should have been followed (Keesing 1934:63) as set forth by the example of the Vaiinupō-to-Taimalelagi (brother to younger brother) succession. Although Talavou came the closest, neither candidate succeeded in gaining all of Samoa's support and so both were nominated and ratified as Malietoa by their respective constituencies.
Wars of the Confederation – Taua o le Faitasiga.
After Malietoa Mōlī died in 1860 there was no universally recognized leader of Samoa and since the rival contenders had not yet met in battle there was neither an itū mālō nor itū vaivai. Talavou's constituency vastly outnumbered the Laupepa partisans but neither succeeded in gaining complete control over all of Samoa's districts. In 1868, the chiefs and orators loyal to Laupepa instituted a government based on the Western notion of parliamentary monarchy. Malietoa Laupepa was declared King of Samoa in 1869, and relocated his government seat from Malie to Matautu on the east shore of Apia Harbor. Talavou's supporters soon discovered the plot and adamantly refused Laupepa's claim to the kingship, rejecting him as the leader or organizer of any such confederation (faitasiga). Talavou's supporters hurriedly established a rival government seat across the harbor on the Mulinu‘u peninsula, crowning Talavou as King of Samoa. Laupepa was deeply insulted when “all the district leaders” of Samoa – including several from Malietoa Laupepa’s territories – held the deliberating fono at Talavou’s base in Mulinu’u rather than convening at Matautu (Meleiseā 1978a:78). 
Even though the faitasiga was Laupepa’s brainchild, it was obvious that he would not be supported as its leader. Laupepa then sent an army to raid Mulinu‘u and Talavou was forced to return to Savai‘i in 1869. Within a couple of months Talavou had amassed a fleet of warriors that far surpassed Laupepa’s militias and Talavou’s warriors from Savai‘i, Manono, Atua, and A‘ana reestablished his government at Mulinu‘u later on that year. “The battle was carried on,” according to Thomas Trood, “around Apia for 72 consecutive hours, without any intermission” and it was during this battle that the British flag was torn from the British Consulate and the head of a decapitated British soldier was impaled on a fencepost in front of the Consulate building. Talavou feared British retribution and issued a formal apology by way of ifoga and even though Consul Williams rejected the gesture, Great Britain was counted “along with Malietoa Laupepa’s party, as one of the vaivai” because the Consulate did not send warships to punish Talavou (Meleiseā 1987a:79).
Many of Malietoa Laupepa’s supporters fled to their homes but a portion of the army fled south to Sāfata where they defended themselves so fiercely that Talavou’s warriors eventually grew weary of fighting and left Laupepa’s warriors in peace. Laupepa’s allies in Atua and A‘ana built villages to serve as refugee camps for Laupepa’s Tuamasaga supporters who were being driven from their homes by Talavou’s forces. A Native Government document shows that garrisons of Talavou’s “people” from Tuamasaga and Savai‘i were occupying tracts of land in Atua and A‘ana respectively (Tuvale 18). Laupepa's naval force, led by two “European boats”(probably taumualua ) was destroyed by Talavou's Manono-based fleet off the A‘ana coast near Faleasi‘u and Tufulele in 1870, the same year that the Manono sea-warriors defeated Laupepa's Fagaloa-based fleet offshore at Nofoali‘i, A‘ana (Tuvale 18–19).
On several occasions, Malietoa Laupepa himself fled Tuamasaga and sought temporary refuge in A‘ana where he garnered support among relatives and Tumua allies from A‘ana and Atua districts (Keesing 1934:63); he was also “in retirement” in 1873 during which time he sought refuge for about two years with his father's-sister, Patosina [Emma]. In 1871, Talavou and Laupepa observed a brief period of peace and mourning in memory of their fallen kinsman Tuimaleali‘ifano To‘oā Sualauvī. Following this cease-fire the island of ‘Upolu erupted in violence as Talavou’s forces fought Laupepa’s in Tuamasaga, warriors from Itū-o-Tane, Savai‘i besieged Leulumoega, A‘ana and Talavou’s Fa‘asāleleaga fleet invaded Atua. 
The War of the Faitasiga was actually a series of conflicts that did not truly end until Talavou’s death in 1880, even though official peace talks were held in April 1873. During the negotiations both parties decided that Laupepa would be installed in joint-kingship with a “co-king” nominated by the Sā Tupua and that Talavou would return to Savai‘i, ending his four-year occupation of Tuamasaga. As the leader of the itū mālō it seems strange that Talavou would agree to give up his holdings on ‘Upolu and relinquish his claim to the throne and there is indication that the Tuamasaga-Manono-Savai‘i party installed him as King of Samoa in 1874. Tupua Pulepule was chosen over Tuiatua Matā‘afa Fagamanu to rule with Laupepa as joint-king. The dual kingship was supplemented by the “Fono of Ta‘imua, with seven members representing each main district, and the Fono of Faipule, with 36 representatives from the sub-districts” (Meleiseā 1987b:82).
Malietoa Talavou, Malietoa Laupepa and New Governments.
In May 1875, an influential American colonel, Albert Steinberger, coordinated the drafting of a constitution which did away with the co-kingship, reorganized the Faipule and Ta‘imua parliaments, and established a “rotating” kingship which provided the chance for both the Sā Malietoa and the Sā Tupua to occupy the throne in alternating succession. This meant that Laupepa would rule as King of Samoa for four years, at which time a king would be chosen from the Sā Tupua to rule for four years, etc. Steinberger also gained the trust and support of King Laupepa, the Ta‘imua and the Faipule and secured the office of Premier for himself on May 22, 1875 (Gilson 318).
In 1876, King Laupepa was coerced by American Consul Foster and L.M.S. figures into signing Steinberger's deportation order, an action that sorely disappointed the members of the Faipule and the Ta‘imua. The two Fono houses removed Malietoa Laupepa from the throne and Tupua Tamasese Titimaea emerged as a new leader. Meanwhile, Laupepa established himself in Malie and rallied support for his campaign, known as the Puletua. The Puletua declared Laupepa king in June 1877, reinforced the Taumuafā fortress and declared war on the Ta‘imua and Faipule. Malietoa Talavou mobilized his forces to attack Laupepa's Puletua in July 1877, prompting Laupepa's men to flee Taumuafā for Vaimoso (Tuvale 23). The Puletua disbanded in mid-July when Laupepa was captured by men from Manono and Talavou's victory against Laupepa's Faipule and Ta‘imua sympathizers was sealed three months later at Fale‘ula, Tuamasaga. 
The Ta‘imua and Faipule reassumed their operation but were unable to simultaneously govern the nation and deal with foreign consular demands; within months of Puletua's defeat, much of Samoa began looking once again to the two Malietoas for leadership. In 1878, Talavou's government was reestablished in Mulinu‘u with Talavou declared King of Samoa. Talavou reportedly received the Tuia‘ana title around this time, in January 1879 (Tu'u'u 2002). Talavou was again installed as king on August 28, 1879, and Laupepa's supporters immediately opposed to this new government. When the Ta‘imua and Faipule expressed their discontent with Talavou's coronation they were immediately dismissed from Mulinu‘u and literally chased to the A‘ana border by Talavou's warriors from Vaimauga and Faleata (Tuvale 27).
Malietoa Talavou suffered great humiliation when he was taken hostage in July 1879 under command of village leaders from the Gagaifomauga and Gaga‘emauga districts of northern Savai‘i. The village councils involved were fined $2,500 by the government and personal vengeance would later be exacted by Talavou through devastating attacks against Saleaula in 1880.
By September 1879, another major war was waging between the two declared Malietoa kings of Samoa. Malietoa Laupepa had met with delegates of the foreign consuls and signed a convention through which “the Samoan Government gave up all jurisdiction over the town, harbour and neighborhood of Apia” (Sorenson &amp; Theroux 2005). Many Samoans opposed Laupepa's actions, which were becoming more and more “puppet-like,” and by December 1879, most of Laupepa's Puletua chiefs had rallied behind Talavou and his Pulefou, as the new government was called; even the demoralized houses of the Ta‘imua and Faipule endorsed Talavou's right to the throne. The ascension was made official through the Bismarck Constitution signed on December 15, 1879, aboard the German corvette SMS Bismarck. Under the new constitution Malietoa Talavou was recognized as King of Samoa for life; this decision was ratified by the British government on January 14, 1880 (through Captain Purvis’ recognition of Talavou's sovereignty), and again on March 24, 1880, by the governments of the United States, Great Britain and Germany (Bevans 68–70). Laupepa was named Suitupu (“Vice-King” or “Deputy King”) and Matā‘afa Iosefo, Premier
While support for Talavou as king was overwhelming, it was not unanimous. In June 1880 the Tumua confederates of Atua formally declared their opposition to Talavou's kingship; Talavou reacted by sending a war party to attack an A‘ana delegation headed for Atua. More chaos ensued in early 1880 when the chiefs of Palauli, Sāleaula, and Tutuila sided with the Tumua faction of the A‘ana and Atua districts. The Samoan chronicler Te‘o Tuvale recorded that the Talavou's enraged supporters from Sātuapa‘itea Fa‘asāleleaga “arose and drove away the people of Palauli and burned their village” (66). The Tumua quickly launched a counterattack against Talavou's districts in Savai‘i but the A‘ana-Atua fleet was repelled and the Tumua's audacity was rewarded with further razing of A‘ana plantations and communities at the hands of Talavou's Tuamasaga faction (66).
Death and succession.
Malietoa Talavou, “the central figure” (Gray 68) of the newborn Samoan monarchy, died November 8, 1880, as King of Samoa, Tupu o Sālafai, Tonumaipe‘a, and alleged Tuia‘ana. His nephew Malietoa Laupepa was seated on the throne nine days later. Talavou's son, Fa'alataitaua, was installed as Malietoa in 1900 and also served as Ta'imua until his death in 1910 (Efi 1995).

1987 Norwegian First Division

The 1987 1. divisjon was the 43rd completed season of top division football in Norway. The season began on 2 May 1987 and ended on 10 October 1987.
22 rounds were played. Number eleven and twelve were relegated. The winners of the two groups of the 2. divisjon were promoted, as well as the winner of a series of play-off matches between the two second placed teams in the two groups of the 2. divisjon and number ten in the 1. divisjon.
For the first time in the Norwegian top flight, three rather than two points were given for wins. There was also another, more controversial new rule for points: if a match was drawn, two points would be given to the winner of a penalty shootout, and one point to the loser of the shootout. This rule, suggested by Tom A. Schanke and appointed by the Norwegian Football Association in February 1987, was highly controversial and liquidated after the 1987 season. Note that if draws would end as draws with one point to each, as usual, Tromsø IL would have been placed 10th with a possibility of being relegated.
Overview.
Moss FK, coached by Nils Arne Eggen, won the league for the first and, as of the 2024 season, last time. The victory was not settled until the final round of the league, with Moss beating runners-up Molde FK (who would have grabbed the gold if they defeated Moss) 2-0 at away grounds.

Amboró National Park

Amboró National Park in central Bolivia is a nature reserve with over 912 species of birds, over 177 mammalian species including puma, ocelot, and the rare spectacled bear. Covering an area of 4,425 km² (1,709 sq mi), it is protected from human settlements, hunting, mining and deforestation, though problems with all these still exist within the park. The Carrasco National Park is placed adjacent to Amboró, and together the two form a larger conservation unit.
Description and geography.
Amboró National Park is in the western part of Santa Cruz Department, at the "Elbow of the Andes", where the eastern cordillera bends slightly westward from its northern course. Amboró National Park lies within the Central Andes bioregion and protects parts of several distinct ecoregions: Southwest Amazon moist forests, Dry Chaco, Bolivian montane dry forests, Chiquitano dry forests, and Yungas at higher elevations.
 The peculiar features of the geography of the Amboró park area determine the biological makeup, with a great variety of flora and fauna. The altitude in the park ranges from up to in the westernmost part of the park in an area called "Siberia". Most of the park has elevations of between and . Annual rainfall ranges between and . Amboró National Park holds some fine expressions of Yungas forests.
Access.
The area is bordered to the north and south by two roads that connect the cities of Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. The southern road, built in the 1950s and once asphalted, was left decaying after the opening of the northern route in the 1980s. Today it has returned to gravel and dirt, limiting traffic and commercial exchange on south side of Amboró National Park.
Off of these two roads are a number of secondary gravel ones, allowing access to the more developed parts of the northern and southern Integrated Management Natural Areas or IMNAs. Small trails and river beds permit pedestrian access to the park, although this is limited by the rough topography. The principal access points to the northern zone are the towns of Buena Vista, Santa Fe, and Yapacani, along the northern Cochabamba-Santa Cruz road. Several dirt tracks lead off from there notably to Espejitos, Saguayó, La Chonta, Macuñucu and to the Yapacani river. In the southern zone, the principal access points are also secondary roads principally departing from the towns of El Torno, Samaipata, Mairana, Pampa Grande, Mataral, and Comarapa which are located on the main highway.
By law you have to have a guide to enter the park.
History.
Creation.
Initially created in 1973, the park was originally established as the "Reserva de Vida Silvestre German Busch". In 1984, with the help of the native biologist Noel Kempff, British zoologist Robin Clark and others, the park became a national park protecting 1,800 km². In 1991, it expanded to 6,376 km2.; however in 1995 it was reduced to 4,425 km².
Management.
In 1989, from the town of Buena Vista and with a very limited budget, the Decentralized Unit of the Santa Cruz Forest Development Center took charge of the park's first management, consisting essentially in flora and fauna inventories, a census of the park's human population and a few information campaigns. This period saw the construction of the Mataracú, Saguayo, La Chonta, and Macuñucú ranger stations, administered by a liaison office, 10 park rangers, material and equipment. With support from TNC's Parks in Peril (PiP) program, the Fundación Amigos de la Naturaleza (FAN) took part in the management of the park's Southern Zone, with offices in Samaipata and Comarapa.
In 1991, with its first significant grant, FAN formed a management committee, with headquarters in Buena Vista, with the CDF being officially in charge of the area's management. That same year, the park size was extended to 637,000 ha without prior consultation of the local population and disregarding legitimate private property rights, a move which triggered serious protests and resistance against the park.
With funding from the Regional Alternative Development Program (Programa de Desarrollo Alternativo Regional - PDAR), a consensus was finally reached with the establishment of two different management categories, indicated on the ground by a so-called "Red Line", a narrow trail that marks the boundary between the National Park and the Integrated Management Natural Zone (IMNA), effectively a Multiple Use Zone.
In 1994, FAN was selected by the newly created Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment to supervise the drafting of the area's management plan. The "Red Line" was officially approved in 1995, allotting 442,500 ha to the national park and 195,100 ha to the IMNA, divided in various patches. Local conflicts have since forced a constant redefinition of limits, so the exact boundaries between the two categories are not precisely known.
In 1995, the National Directorate for Biodiversity Conservation (Dirección Nacional de Conservación de la Biodiversidad - DNCB, today's SERNAP), the administration in charge of the country's protected areas decided to reclaim supervision of the area. Despite the signings of a contract between DNCB and FAN for the co-administration of the area, since this date the government has been solely in charge of the protected area.
Flora.
Parque Nacionál Amboró is one of the most botanically rich national parks in the world. The current number of documented plant species totals around 3,000, though this is almost certainly an underestimate. By comparison, the much more thoroughly documented and very biologically rich Hawaiian Island archipelago, which covers about six times the total area of Parque Nacional Amboró, has only about 2,800 native plant species, while the British Isles (covering about 65 times the area of Amboró) have only around 2,000. Even the entire California Floristic Province, one of the world's botanical biodiversity hotspots, contains only 8,000 plant species—about 2.5 times as many as Amboró—though it covers an area over 170 times larger. Much of the biodiversity of Amboró is partitioned according to the park's highly dissected topography and the widely varying climatic regimes that accompany the sharp transitions in elevation. Vegetational diversity is equally exceptional within the park, with lowland forests, montane forests, yungas and cloud forest, subpáramo, montane and non-montane scrublands, pampas, cactus forests, palm forests, forests composed almost entirely of treeferns, bromeliad-laden cliffs, epilithic subalpine plant communities, and others. The ecotones between these vegetation types are often sharply delineated according to aspect and elevation, yielding a highly heterogenous landscape that can make traveling in the park a dramatic and surprising experience.
Another factor contributing to the park's high plant species richness is its location at the confluence of several diverse and unique floristic regions: the tropical Amazon lowlands and pampas to the north and southeast, the subantarctic high Andes and altiplano to the west and southwest, the subtropical Tucumano-Boliviano forests to the south (these forests do not actually reach Amboró but many of their constituent species occur within the park), and the semiarid inter-Andean valleys and wet-tropical yungas forests that characterize the eastern slopes of the central Bolivian Andes. Due to the difficulty of the terrain and the almost complete lack of infrastructure throughout the park, much of it has never been botanically surveyed, and it is essentially beyond doubt that many more plant species await discovery within the park's more remote regions. The high rates of endemism throughout the tropical Andes (Amboró is no exception) suggest quite strongly that at least some of the undocumented plant species yet to be discovered within Amboró will almost certainly be Amboró endemics that are currently unknown to science.
Of the documented species, some of the most ecologically and economically interesting are bigleaf mahogany, mountain pine, black walnut (no relation to the eastern North American tree of the same name), limachu, q'illu q'illu ("Berberis bumaelifolia", also spelled "khellu khellu"), cebillo, bibosi, ambaiba, pacay, and clavo rojo. In the cloud-enveloped forests there are extensive patches of giant tree ferns. In addition, there are pachiuva, açaí palms and many species of endemic orchids.
Fauna.
177 species of mammals have been registered; among them 43 species of bats.
Among the large mammals we find the spectacled bear (locally known as the "jucumari"), the jaguar, and the giant anteater. The park presents a high level of endemism, including 173 species of amphibians with 50 species of toads alone, as well as 135 species of reptiles.
The number of bird species observed within the area exceeds 912, or more than 60% of the country's total. Two of the most interesting are arguably the southern helmeted curassow and the military macaw.
Finally, 109 species of fish species have been identified by the IMNA alone, with a clear dependence on altitude. The largest specimens, which are the principal targets of commercial and subsistence fishing - such as sábalo, barred surubim, and pacú - are restricted to the alluvial plains, below 700 m. Above just 1000 m, the fish diversity diminishes dramatically.
Human population.
In the northern area, colonial settlements originated in the highlands. The region on the southern boundary is inhabited by peasants from the valleys of the department; while toward the east Guarayas communities are settled. Surrounding the area are colorful towns like: Samaipata, Comarapa and Buena Vista.

Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)

 "Breakfast at Tiffany's" is a novella by Truman Capote published in 1958. In it, a contemporary writer recalls his early days in New York City, when he makes the acquaintance of his remarkable neighbor, Holly Golightly. In 1961 it was adapted into a major motion picture of the same name.
Setting.
The novella is set in 1940s New York, specifically the Upper East Side, in a brownstone apartment. An area that experienced many changes following the Civil War, it went through its most major shift at the turn of the century. Broadly speaking, brownstones (the type of building that Holly lives in) were rebranded as more "stylish" places to live, rather than being thought of as decrepit and outdated buildings. By the 1940s, it had become a fairly affluent area. The novella's setting plays a great role in the plot; various wealthy characters from the Upper East Side come in and out of Holly Golightly's life.
Though the novella does not take place in the American South, there are mentions of it later in the novella: The reader follows Golightly's life in Manhattan for the entirety of the novella, but she was actually born in Texas, a place that she was desperate to escape.
Plot.
In autumn 1943, the unnamed narrator befriends Holly Golightly. The two are tenants in a brownstone apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side. Holly (age 18–19) is a country girl turned New York café society girl. As such, she has no job and lives by socializing with wealthy men, who take her to clubs and restaurants, and give her money and expensive presents; she hopes to marry one of them. According to Capote, Golightly is not a prostitute, but an "American geisha".
As the novella opens, the reader is introduced to an unnamed narrator who reflects back on his friendship with Holly Golightly. Another old friend, Joe Bell, reaches out to the narrator because he believes a wood carving that he has come across depicts Golightly. The reader can assume many years have passed, as the carving is said to be from 1956.
The narrator recalls the specific night he meets Holly. She climbs through his window in order to escape the man that came home with her that night. She mentions the resemblance the narrator has to her brother, Fred, and asks if she can call him that. As they continue to talk, Holly realizes it is Thursday, and explains to the narrator that she visits a prisoner, Sally Tomato, every Thursday in exchange for $100.
We are introduced to a slew of characters that are constantly coming in and out of Holly's apartment. During this scene, she strikes up a conversation with our narrator about how Tiffany's is the only place that calms her when she's feeling anxious or overwhelmed. The title is attributed to this scene.
The narrator and Holly's friendship develops, but they feud over a trifling matter. However, when the narrator suspects Holly is being watched, he decides it may be right to break the feud to warn her about this person. He is confronted by the man who has been watching her. The man tells the narrator of Holly's past. He divulges that she was born Lulamae Barnes, and that he is her husband, Doc Golightly. Doc tries to persuade her to come back to Texas with him, but she insists she must stay in New York. They part ways.
Holly finds out her brother has died in the war and this sends her into an emotional downward spiral. She eventually strikes up a relationship with a character named José Ybarra-Jaegar and plans to move to Brazil with him.
Eventually, Holly's visits to the prison draw suspicion and she is arrested after further evidence unveils that Sally Tomato was running a drug ring. José sends her a letter explaining that he does not see a future with her because of her arrest. After getting out on bail, she plans to leave and go to Brazil without José. Before leaving, she sets her cat loose—the cat that she had never given a name. The narrator receives a brief note from her, but hears nothing else. He hopes, though, she has found a place that feels like home.
Conception.
In early drafts of the story Holly was named Connie Gustafson; Capote later changed her name to Holiday Golightly. He apparently based the character of Holly on several different women, all friends or close acquaintances of his. Claims have been made as to the source of the character, the "real Holly Golightly", in what Capote called the "Holly Golightly Sweepstakes", including socialite Gloria Vanderbilt, actress Oona O'Neill, writer/actress Carol Grace, writer Maeve Brennan, writer Doris Lilly, model Dorian Leigh (whom Capote dubbed "Happy Go Lucky"), and her sister, model Suzy Parker. A November 2020 obituary in "The New York Times" states that the main inspiration for Holly was socialite Marguerite Littman.
Capote's biographer Gerald Clarke wrote "half the women he knew... claimed to be the model for his wacky heroine." Clarke also wrote of the similarities between the author himself and the character. There are also similarities between the lives of Holly and Capote's mother, Nina Capote; among other shared attributes both women were born in the rural South, with similar "hick" birth names that they changed (Holly Golightly was born Lulamae Barnes in Texas, Nina Capote was born Lillie Mae Faulk in Alabama), both left the husbands they married as teenagers and abandoned relatives they loved and were responsible for, instead going to New York, and both achieved "café society" status through relationships with wealthier men, though Capote's mother was born two decades earlier than the fictional Holly Golightly. Capote was also unsuccessfully sued for libel and invasion of privacy by a Manhattan resident named Bonnie Golightly who claimed that he had based Holly on her.
According to the biographer of Joan McCracken, McCracken had a violent dressing room outburst after learning of the wartime death of her brother, while she was appearing in the play "Bloomer Girl" (1944). McCracken's biographer suggests that Capote was inspired by this event as a model for a scene in which Holly reacts to her brother's death overseas. McCracken and her husband Jack Dunphy were close friends of Capote, and Dunphy became Capote's life companion after his 1948 divorce from McCracken. In the novella, Holly Golightly is also depicted singing songs from "Oklahoma!" (in which McCracken appeared) accompanying herself on a guitar, and owning "The Baseball Guide", which was edited by McCracken's uncle.
Publication history.
"Breakfast at Tiffany's" was originally sold to "Harper's Bazaar" for $2,000 and intended for publication in its July 1958 issue. It was to be illustrated with a big series of photo montages by David Attie, who had been hired for the job by "Harper's" art director Alexey Brodovitch. However, after the publication was scheduled, longtime "Harper"s editor Carmel Snow was ousted by the magazine's publisher, the Hearst Corporation, and Hearst executives began asking for changes to the novella's tart language. By this time, Attie's montages had been completed, and Alice Morris, the fiction editor of "Harper's", recounted that while Capote initially refused to make any changes, he relented "partly because I showed him the layouts... six pages with beautiful, atmospheric photographs". Yet Hearst ordered "Harper's" not to run the novella anyway. Its language and subject matter were still deemed "not suitable", and there was concern that Tiffany's, a major advertiser, would react negatively.
An outraged Capote soon resold the work to "Esquire" for $3,000 ($ today); by his own account, he specified that he "would not be interested if ["Esquire"] did not use Attie's [original series of] photographs". He wrote to "Esquire" fiction editor Rust Hills, "I'm happy that you are using [Attie's] pictures, as I think they are excellent." But to his disappointment, "Esquire" ran just one full-page image of Attie's (another was later used as the cover of at least one paperback edition of the novella). Attie's photo was the first-ever visual depiction of Holly Golightly—who is seen laughing and smiling in a nightclub. The novella appeared in the November 1958 issue. Shortly afterward, a collection of the novella and three short stories by Capote was published by Random House — and the glowing reviews caused sales of the "Esquire" issue to skyrocket. Both Attie and Brodovitch went on to work with Capote on other projects – Attie on "", and Brodovitch on "Observations", both published in 1959.
In 2021, Esquire re-ran the novella online, reuniting the text with many of Attie's original images.
The collection has been reprinted several times with the other short stories, "House of Flowers", "A Diamond Guitar" and "A Christmas Memory". The novella itself has been included in other Capote collections.
Capote's original typed manuscript was offered for sale by a New Hampshire auction house in April 2013. It was sold to Igor Sosin, a Russian billionaire entrepreneur, for US$306,000 (). Sosin said he planned to display it publicly in Moscow and Monte Carlo.
Literary significance and reception.
In "Breakfast at Sally Bowles", Ingrid Norton of "Open Letters Monthly" pointed out Capote's debt to Christopher Isherwood, one of his mentors, in creating the character of Holly Golightly: ""Breakfast at Tiffany's" is in many ways Capote's personal crystallization of Isherwood's Sally Bowles."
Truman Capote's aunt, Marie Rudisill, notes that Holly is a kindred spirit of Miss Lily Jane Bobbit, the central character of his short story "Children on Their Birthdays". She observes that both characters are "unattached, unconventional wanderers, dreamers in pursuit of some ideal of happiness".
Capote said Golightly was the favorite of his characters.
The novella's prose style prompted Norman Mailer to call Capote "the most perfect writer of my generation," adding that he "would not have changed two words in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"".
Adaptations.
Film.
The novella was loosely adapted into the 1961 movie "Breakfast at Tiffany's" starring Audrey Hepburn and directed by Blake Edwards. The movie was transposed to 1960 rather than the 1940s, the period of the novella. In addition to this, at the end of the film the protagonist and Holly fall in love and stay together, whereas in the novella there is no love affair whatsoever – Holly just leaves the United States and the narrator has no idea what happened to her since then, except for a photograph of a wood carving found years later in Africa which bears a striking resemblance to Holly. In addition, there are many other changes, including major omissions, to the plot and main character in the film from the novella. Capote originally envisioned Marilyn Monroe as Holly, and lobbied the studio for her, but the film was done at Paramount, and though Monroe did independent films, including for her own production company, she was still under contract with Twentieth Century Fox, and had just completed "Let's Make Love" with Yves Montand.
Musical.
A musical version of "Breakfast at Tiffany's" (also known as "Holly Golightly") premiered in 1966 in Boston. The initial performances were panned by the critics and despite a rewrite by Edward Albee, it closed after four previews and never officially opened.
Television.
Three years after the musical adaptation, Stefanie Powers and Jack Kruschen starred in another adaptation, "Holly Golightly" (1969), an unsold ABC sitcom pilot. Kruschen's role was based on Joe Bell, a major character in Capote's novella who was omitted from the film version.
Plays.
Two adaptations of the novella into stage plays have been directed by Sean Mathias. The first production was written by Samuel Adamson and was presented in 2009 at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London, starring Anna Friel as Holly Golightly and Joseph Cross as William "Fred" Parsons. 
The second version was written by Richard Greenberg for a 2013 Broadway production at the Cort Theatre, starring Emilia Clarke as Holly Golightly, Cory Michael Smith as Fred, and George Wendt as Joe Bell. The Greenberg play was produced in the UK in 2016, called "a play with music". It ran at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in the West End in June to September 2016, with Pixie Lott starring as Holly Golightly.

Didier de Saint-Jaille

Fra' Didier de Saint-Jaille (died 26 September 1536) was the 46th Grand Master of the Order of Saint John between 1535 and 1536.
De Saint-Jaille was a French nobleman who joined the Knights Hospitaller as part of the Langue of France. He was particularly known for his great prudence, and was elected as Grandmaster following Piero de Ponte's death. At the time he was in France, and so made preparations to go to Malta. However, he fell ill at Montpellier and died before he made it to the island on 26 September 1536.
He was the only Grand Master of Malta who did not die and was not buried in Malta, apart from Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim, who left the islands with the Order's expulsion in 1798. Coincidentally, both Didier de Saint-Jaille and Hompesch are buried in Montpellier.
While he was away from Malta, the knight Jacques Pelliquen acted as Lieutenant Grandmaster, and during his rule Maltese and Calabrian soldiers destroyed El Haid Tower which was close to Tripoli (then a possession of the Order).

Grotrian studied the emission line from the solar corona in the green region of the spectrum; this emission line could not be attributed to any known chemical element and was thought to be a new element (which scientists named "coronium"). Grotrian and Bengt Edlén from Sweden demonstrated that the two observed emission lines arise from iron atoms that have lost about half their 26 electrons.

George Vasilakos

George Vasilakos is president and art director of Eden Studios, Inc., and manages the company's daily operations.
Early life.
As a youth living in Colonie, New York, Vasilakos was a comic book collector who estimated that he had around 3500 comics as of 1986. 
New Millenium Entertainment.
After finishing art school, George Vasilakos opened a store called Imagination Games &amp; Comics in Albany, New York in 1992 that provided table space to play games. Several role-playing gamers started to frequent the store, one of them the attorney M. Alexander Jurkat. Vasilakos and this circle of gamers went to Gencon together, where they were impressed by the new collectible card game (CCG) "". Five members of the group, including Vasilakos and Jurkat, decided to publish their own CCG and formed New Millenium Entertainment (NME), with Vasilakos as the art director. 
Their first product, released in 1995, was "Battlelords" CCG. Although the game initially sold well, the company printed too many copies, and the resultant production and storage bills for the unsold stock started to weigh on the company's finances.
Attempting to diversify, NME looked for a role-playing game to publish, and came across a small press game called "Conspiracy X", which was thematically based on the then-popular television show "The X Files". Working with the game's original writers, Rick Ernst, Shirley Madewell and Chris Pallace, NME fleshed out the rules and produced a 224-page softcover book in 1996. The game proved popular, but sales revenues were not enough to save NME.
Eden Studios.
Increasing debt forced NME out of business, and Vasilakos closed Imagination Games &amp; Comics in June 1997. The following month, Vasilakos and Jurkat joined with investor Ed Healy to announce that they had started Eden Studios with Vasilakos working for the company full-time, and they had acquired the rights to continue the "Conspiracy X" line.
Vasilakos and Jurkat were fans of the work done by C.J. Carella, and in July 1998 they announced an exclusive license to the "WitchCraft" and "" role-playing games by Carella, previously published by small-press roleplaying publisher Myrmidon Press.
Last Unicorn Games.
In 1999, Last Unicorn Games offered Vasilakos the position of art director, so he moved to California to work in their office, while still remaining president of Eden Studios. Vasilakos retained the position of art director when Last Unicorn was bought by Wizards of the Coast in 2000, and then bought by Decipher, Inc. in 2001.
During this time, Vasilakos and Christopher Shy entered the zombie role-playing market, creating "All Flesh Must Be Eaten" in 2000. At Decipher, Vasilakos worked on the "Star Trek" and "Lord of the Rings" RPGs. Vasilakos directed all the graphics work on the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", "Angel", and "Army of Darkness" roleplaying game lines for Eden Studios.
In 2003, Vasilakos opened another game store in Albany, New York called Zombie Planet. Vasilakos used edenstudios.net as a website for Zombie Planet, to sell adventure games. Zombie Planet briefly had its own website in the early 2020s. Vasilakos offered curbside service during the COVID-19 pandemic because customers could not enter the Zombie Planet store.
In 2012, Vasilakos appeared on a gaming panel at Gencon discussing "Zombies in Gaming". In 2016, he helped graphic artist Francis Hogan develop the kid-friendly RPG "Adventure Maximus". Vasilakos was the inspiration behind the "Abduction" and "" card games.
Personal life.
Vasilakos lives in Loudonville, New York with his wife and two sons, Theo and Dimitri and daughter Sophia.

River Cocker, Lancashire

The River Cocker is a river in Lancashire, England.
The River Cocker rises near to Yeat House Farm and Higher Knowe Hill south of Quernmore, near Lancaster.
It runs south westerly through Cocker Clough Wood and Brunstow Wood, then by Hampson Green, before briefly turning north west when joined by Potters Brook at the hamlet of Potters Brook close to the M6 motorway, where it is channeled under the Lancaster Canal.
The river then skirts south around Cockerham, by Little Crimbles before being swollen by Park Lane Brook and Lee Brook and flowing into saltflats below Cockersand Abbey on the Lune estuary. The river is, approximately 17.5 km (10.9 miles) in length.
Cockerham Marsh is a designated SSSI and the Cocker Estuary is a favoured overwintering site of migratory pink-footed goose, which can be seen in flocks of over one thousand, at times. It is also nationally important for other winter seabirds, including oystercatcher, turnstone, grey plover, knot, curlew, common redshank and dunlin. In summer, it hosts impressive numbers of ringed plover.
Etymology.
The name refers to cocker, a breeder of, hunter of, or fighter with game birds. This is appropriate given the local farming of poultry and the presence of many partridge and other game birds in the surrounding area.
Water quality and pollution.
The River Cocker, along with its neighbour the River Conder lie within the Pilling, Ridgy, Cocker and Conder Operational Catchment of the Environment Agency's Lune Management Catchment. The area is heavily pastorally farmed, with extensive cattle, sheep and poultry stock and agricultural pollution is identified as the main reason that waters have yet to attain “Good” status.
United Utilities has made funding available for the “Cocker and Conder Clean Up”. Recent reporting has identified the overall quality of the water as “Moderate” for environmental pollution (ammonia and phosphates) and “Good” for chemical contamination.

Super Junky Monkey

Super Junky Monkey was an all female Japanese funk metal group.
History.
Beginning.
Their first release was in 1994: a live recording called "Cabbage", originally released as an audio recording, but also released as a video recording later that year. This was quickly followed in 1995 by the studio album "Screw Up", which features some of the songs from "Cabbage" as well as some new tracks.
The band released two full-length albums, both of which were released internationally. Additionally, in Japan, they released several EPs and three concert videos.
The band's performances of "Skysurfers!!" and "I Call Myself Sliced Ice" were used as the opening and end credits music, respectively, for the second season of the American animated series, "Skysurfer Strike Force".
The album "Super Junky Alien" features a bonus 1996 cover of the MTV Top of the Hour tune.
Death of Mutsumi.
On February 5, 1999, Mutsumi Fukuhara committed suicide by leaping from the balcony of her apartment in Osaka, leaving behind her husband and one-year-old son. The other band members decided not to continue without her and instead moved on to other projects.
Several years after Mutsumi's death, the band released the material they were working on at the time as the "E-KISS-O" EP and the greatest hits "Songs Are Our Universe". "E-KISS-O" includes three songs with Mutsumi's vocals and two instrumentals. "Songs of Our Universe" features two unreleased tracks and several videos. On June 20, 2009, the remaining three members of Super Junky Monkey reunited to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Mutsumi's death with a performance at the Liquid Room in Tokyo, Japan.
Musical style.
They performed and merged various styles and genres of music, including hardcore, heavy metal, hip hop, jazz, avant-garde, noise rock and funk. Influences on the band members include Steve Vai, Jaco Pastorius, Madball, Pink Floyd and Mr. Bungle. AllMusic states "A quick description of the band would be 'Japanese all-girl Faith No More or Primus'".

Scottish Crofting Federation

The Scottish Crofting Federation (SCF), formerly called the Scottish Crofting Foundation (also formerly called the Scottish Crofters Union), is an organization of crofting communities in the highlands and islands of Scotland.
The SCF's mission is to safeguard and promote the rights, livelihoods, and culture of crofters and their communities.
Its magazine is called "The Crofter".
SCF (Scottish Crofting Federation).
The SCF is a charity dedicated to safeguarding crofting and its cultural heritage. 
Established and run by crofters, SCF engages with agencies and government at a local, national, and international level to influence policy on rural issues including sustaining rural populations, food production, and environmental protection.
It also provides a network of support to established, new, and aspiring crofters through training, mentoring, and sharing of experience.
Scottish crofting produce mark.
The Scottish crofting produce mark was introduced in 2008 to identify products produced by a croft or similar small agri-business that is located in the Highlands or the Islands of Scotland.
Only those businesses that qualify and are members of the Scottish Crofting Federation may place the mark on their products.
The federation states on its website that it plans to enforce product quality, cleanliness, and traceability, as well as ensure animals are healthy and reasonably treated.
Importance of crofting.
Crofting has sustained rural communities in many areas in Western Europe.
Crofting provides certain benefits to the local community.
Small-scale eco-friendly systems, as practiced by crofters, is an alternative to industrial agriculture.
Much of the UK's High Nature Value farming is found in the crofting areas.
Extensive land management methods have created and preserved the habitats of rare species now threatened elsewhere in the UK, and continuing crofting land use is recognized as having an important role in maintaining and increasing biodiversity.
Opposition to marine protected areas.
The SCF opposes Highly Protected Marine Areas, a proposal from the Scottish government to create marine protected areas.
Indigenous people.
The SCF is currently involved in activities to encourage the UK government to recognize crofters as indigenous people of Scotland.

Malietoa

Mālietoa ( "Mālietoa") is a state dynasty and one of the four paramount chiefly titles of Samoa. It is the titular head of one of the two great royal families of Samoa: Sā Malietoa. Literally translated as "great warrior", the title's origin comes from the final words of Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki as he was fleeing on the beach to his boat, "Mālie toa, mālie tau" ("Great warrior, bravely you have fought"). 
The Malietoa title is currently held by HH Malietoa Faamausili Moli and HH Malietoa Bob Ainuu Afamasaga based on Samoa's Lands and Titles Court Decision of August 17, 2018. HH Malietoa Faamausili Moli  is a member of Samoa’s Council of Deputies and eligible for the Head of State and his co-heir Malietoa Ainuu Bob Tupou Afamasaga is the heir to Samoa's traditional monarch Kingship or Tafaifa.
History.
In early Polynesian history the Tu'i Tonga dynasty from Tu'i Tonga 'Aho'eitutupu'a supreme ruler of Samoa and Tonga ruled from 400AD up until Tongan king Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki of the Tu'i Tonga dynasty ruled, around 1150 to 1400, over several western Polynesian polities including Lau group of islands (eastern Fiji), Niue, 'Uvea, Futuna, 'Upolu, and Savai'i). Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki established a long-term residence at Safotu, Savai'i, Samoa and installed his brother, Lautivunia, as governor of Western Samoa islands. Samoan lore suggests that Talakaifaiki's reign was one of tyranny and oppression that was highly resented by his Samoan subjects.
The seeds of rebellion were planted, according to legend, to the "sons" of Atiogie, namely Savea, Tuna, Fata and Ulumasui (who was actually a grandson of Atiogie). The three brothers and their nephew led a wide-scale campaign of civil disobedience which ultimately escalated into the military overthrow of Talakaifaiki. Driven westward from Aleipata, 'Upolu (where the Tu'i Tonga's birthday festivities were underway) to the coast of Mulifanua, the king and his bodyguards were cornered against the sea.
There was fierce fighting all the way to the sea whereon the Tu'i Tonga reached his superior navy vessels and called out to those on the land. Upon his departure, the aged monarch delivered a short speech which praised the brave fighting qualities of the Samoan warriors and conceded victory to his once-subjects. The Malietoa title is taken from the opening phrase of that speech: ""Mālie toa, mālie tau"," meaning "great warriors, well fought."
It is said that the brothers Tuna and Fata both took a fancy to the honor spoken by the deposed Tu'i Tonga and a quarrel between the two ensued. Legend tells that one brother was struck dead by the other and chaos was averted by their eldest brother, Savea, who resuscitated and placated both contenders.
The political vacuum left by the ousting of Talakaifaiki was immediately filled by Savea, meaning all the areas Tui Tonga Talakaifaiki once ruled was then under the rulership of Savea the first Malietoa. King Savea was bestowed the title Malietoa which his brothers had fought over and was hence honored in Samoan oratory as King Malietoa Savea-ali'i (Lord Savea), Savea Tu-vae-lua (Savea Who Stands on Both Feet), and Savea-matua (Savea the Elder). The appellation "Na-fa'alogo-iai-Samoa (He Who Samoa Listened To)" was added on during the time of Malietoa Vainu'upo who, as Tupu Tafa'ifa after the death of Tamafaiga, formally accepted Christianity into Samoa in the late 1800s.
Succession list.
The following is a compiled list of the Malietoa holders. A handful of other versions are also recorded; however, the overall consistency of chronology and nomenclature is impressive given the oral nature of Samoan genealogy transmission.
Modern branches of the Sa Malietoa.
The descendants of the Malietoa lineage, both titular and biological, are referred to collectively as the Sā Malietoa. The Sā Malietoa of today is expansive and transcends geographical boundaries, religious persuasions, socio-economic class and even ethnicity (considering various chiefly families in Fiji and other Pacific societies are genealogically linked to the Malietoa family). The subject of descendants of the Malietoa title is a thorny one riddled with claims and counter-claims present from the first Malietoa to the present day.
In terms of relative history, the "oldest" branch of the modern Sa Malietoa is the Sa Natuitasina (also spelled Gatuitasina). Natuitasina was the half-brother of the holder of the Malietoa title, Malietoa Vai'inupo. Malietoa Vai'inuupo famously accepted Christianity brought to Samoa by the London Missionary Society (LMS) missionary, John Williams. Natutasina is alleged to have allied with his nephew Talavou against the LMS and the pacifist policy of Malietoa Vai'inupo and the Christians in 1840. Although only the apical ancestor of this branch has held the Malietoa title, the 1939 ruling grants the Sa Natuitasina deliberating rights on the succession of the Malietoa title.
Perhaps the most well-known of the three modern branches, the Sā Moli has been highlighted as one of Samoa's four royal families for over a century. The families of the Sa Moli trace their genealogies to Malietoa Moli. The Sa Moli maintains a family council house in Sapapali'i called Poutoa, which, since it was established by Malietoa Vaiinupo, is also held as the ancestral maota of the Sa Natuitasina and Sa Talavou.
The Sa Talavou branch includes all descendants of Malietoa Talavou Pe'a, a son of Malietoa Vai'inupo who was born around 1810. Prominent members of the Sa Talavou include Talavou's son, Fa'alataitaua, who held the Ta'imua office and was named successor to Mata'afa Iosefo's office as Ali'i Sili while under German colonial rule. Fa'alataitaua however did not hold the Malietoa title. 
While not legally recognized by the 1939 Malietoa edict (LC 853), there are technically many other family lineages that can claim genealogical connections as "branches" of the Sa Malietoa. Some of these descendants have come to light through media coverage of the ongoing titular dispute prompted by the death of Malietoa Tanumafili II, including families who claim descent from other Malietoas (besides Natuitasina, Moli and Talavou) and/or their descendants.

Daily Racing Form

The Daily Racing Form (DRF) (referred to as the "Racing Form" or "Form" and sometimes "telegraph" or "telly") is a tabloid newspaper founded in 1894 in Chicago, Illinois, by Frank Brunell. The paper publishes the past performances of racehorses as a statistical service for bettors covering horse racing in North America.
The first edition of the DRF was published in Chicago in November 1894. DRF publishes up to 35 regional editions every day but Christmas.
In cooperation with the National Thoroughbred Racing Association and the National Turf Writers and Broadcasters Association, the "Daily Racing Form" selects the winners of the annual Eclipse Awards.
In 1922, the "DRF" publishing company was sold to Moses Annenberg's Triangle Publications, which would eventually be owned by Walter Annenberg.
In 2007, the Wicks Group sold "DRF" to Arlington Capital Partners for nearly $200 million. Arlington sold the "DRF" parent company, Sports Information Group (SIG), to Z Capital Partners in 2017 for less than $100 million. In 2021, Z Capital merged SIG into a sister company, Affinity Gaming, to form Affinity Interactive. In 2021, DRF released the DRF Sport website in September, and in October released the DRF Cash Grab free-to-play sports prediction app. Together with Affinity Interactive, DRF released its first online sports book. The DRF Bets sports went live in Iowa in January 2022.

Hadon of Ancient Opar

Hadon of Ancient Opar is a fantasy novel by American writer Philip José Farmer, first published in paperback by DAW Books in April 1974, and reprinted three times through 1983. The first British edition was published by Magnum in 1977; it was reprinted by Methuen in 1993. The first trade paperback edition was published by Titan Books in 2013. The work has also been translated into French. It was later gathered together with its sequels "Flight to Opar" and "The Song of Kwasin" into the omnibus collection "Gods of Opar: Tales of Lost Khokarsa" (2012). It and its sequels purport to fill in some of the ancient prehistory of the lost city of Opar, created by Edgar Rice Burroughs as a setting for his Tarzan series.
Plot.
In the plot of the novel, Hadon journeys to Khokarsa to compete in the "Great Games", in which he triumphs. The prize being that he is entitled to marry the ruling high priestess, should she choose to accept him, and thus become high priest and king of the Khokarsa. However, King Minruth is unwilling to relinquish power and schemes to be rid of Hadon.
The novel deals with the expedition of Hadon, a young Oparian warrior, to the Wild Lands and as far as the mysterious Ringing Sea, which would one day be called the Mediterranean, with the strange woman whom he meets and brings with him, and with the cataclysmic civil war which breaks out on his return and which he partly (and completely unintentionally) helps touch off.
The ancient Khokarsan society of which Opar is a part is a matriarchy (a reasonable inference from the culture of the later-day Opar encountered by Tarzan). A delicate balance between the genders is maintained, symbolized by the co-rule of the high priestess and the king (whose main authority is command of the army), which corresponds to some theories of sociologists and historians on the way actual matriarchal societies may have worked. The same scheme is repeated on a smaller scale on the local level, where towns are co-governed by a local priestess and the commander of the local garrison.
The current king, Minruth, tries to subvert this immemorial system and establish exclusive male power, which incidentally would force an incestuous relationship upon the current high priestess, Awineth, who happens to be his daughter. Lalila, the foreign "White Witch from the Sea," whom Hadon brings with him and with whom he falls in love, is used as a pawn in King Minruth's power game; the xenophobic suspicions aroused about her are used in an attempt to undermine the position of women in general.
Hadon and his male and female friends rally to the high priestess' banner against the king's evil schemes.
Setting.
Opar is the first and most frequently re-visited of the many lost cities and cultures which Tarzan discovers in Africa. As portrayed by Burroughs, Opar is ruled by the high priestess La, with whom Tarzan develops a prolonged love/hate relationship. The city itself is a decayed remnant of ancient greatness; it is suggested, though not conclusively, that it is a cut-off colony of Atlantis.
Farmer seizes on Burroughs' ambiguity over the issue to recast Opar as a member city of an otherwise unknown local civilization that flourished in central Africa during the last ice age. It was supposedly based on a pair of now vanished inland seas connected by a narrow strait, with a surface roughly equivalent to the Mediterranean. The two seas facilitated the appearance of a mercantile culture, technologically similar to Ancient Greece, while the rest of the world was still deep in the Stone Age.
Farmer shows this culture at or near the peak of its ancient glory, more than 10,000 years ago. It comprises numerous thriving (and sometimes warring) city states and empires, one of which is Opar. Opar is, in fact, far from the most important of these cities. The Opar described in the Tarzan novels is depicted as a "former colony of Atlantis" and this is adhered to by Farmer, though "Atlantis" in this context—the capital of the empire of which Opar is a province—is located on an island in the African inland sea, not in the Atlantic Ocean.
Eventually, subsequent to the period of his story, the two seas drain off into the Atlantic and the culture dependent on them decays and disappears, leaving only the remnant of Opar forgotten in the jungles where Tarzan will discover it. The seas' modern remnants are represented to be the much-shrunken Lake Chad and the Congo River basin.
While originally derived from the Tarzan series, the world created by Farmer is given its own independent literary existence, with the sociological and cultural aspects worked out in meticulous detail, and a long historical annex added at the end.
Reception.
Lester del Rey found the novel to be "good fun" and noted that Farmer was not imitating Burroughs either in storytelling or characterization, although he faulted Farmer for providing an installment in a longer story rather than one with a dramatic resolution. Commenting on the novel for "The New York Times", Theodore Sturgeon described Farmer as "tireless and astonishing".

Albur

An albur (plural: "albures") is a word play in Mexican Spanish that involves a double entendre.
The first meaning in the Spanish language of albur refers to contingency or chance to which the result is trusted. Like in: "Leave nothing to the albur" or "it was worth the risk of an albur". The term originally referred to the hidden cards in the Spanish Monte betting card game. The word albur is also synonym to uncertainty or random luck "Es un albur".
It is very common among groups of male friends in Mexico, especially urban youth, construction workers, factory workers, mechanics and other blue collar-derivative male groups; and is considered rude otherwise, especially when in the presence of women, given the sexual innuendo in the jokes. Its usage is similar to the English expressions: "If you know what I mean" and "that's what she said". Albur is also a form of comedy and many stand-up artists and comedians, including Alberto Rojas "El Caballo", Polo Polo, Franco Escamilla and others are renowned for their skills at performing albures on drunk bullies and hecklers attending to their shows ("alburear"). Brozo has been known for performing "albures" on several prominent political figures in Mexican television such as Mexico's former president, Felipe Calderón.
The game of albures is usually a subtle, verbal competition in which the players try to show superiority by using albures attempting to leave the opponent without a comeback. Most "albures" have to do with sex, but they also can be just generally degrading, as with comparing the target's stupidity to that of a donkey, ox, or mule.
Specific purposes of the albur can include:
Social aspects.
Classes.
Albures are commonplace in many sectors of Mexican society and are usually regarded as a sign of a witty and agile (though somewhat dirty) mind. It is possible to find people who brag about their skills (at albures) and claim to be "good at it", this phrase being itself an albur (also a self-reference to their virility and sexual power). The albures can be subtle or explicit depending on the author's intention, they are commonly found in almost every Mexican social sector being more common in low-class sectors, but present in higher ones also. However people may sometimes categorize those who use albures as nacos, which is a way of saying "you are despicable for being an urban but uneducated person, whose family comes from the rural poor areas of the country".
Though at first sight outsiders may see albures as a very rude, distasteful, blunt and aggressive activity, it is usually nothing more than a pastime which promotes laughter and is an excuse to joke around with friends. An important aspect of the refinement of an albur exchange is the level at which it can be seen as a double entendre. The most refined albureros can maintain a double entendre conversation in such a way that an unprepared listener would not even realize there was an underlying sexual connotation. In such a case that person would find the giggling, blushing and pausing awkward.
It sometimes happens that a newcomer is "welcomed" into a group or conversation with a quick and unexpected albur. This behaviour tends to immediately set who is the (sexual) aggressor, thus being a form to establish a male hierarchy. A quick comeback gains recognition of the group, though this is seldom expected, due to shyness, surprise, lack of ability to recognize the albur, or lack of ability to produce an answer. For example, at a diner with friends someone saying, "" ('eat it all'), might be jokingly insinuating "you should perform fellatio", an agile mind would give a retaliatory double entendre answer like, "I don't like it, but you can eat mine if you like" (").
Women.
Women play a crucial role in the language and focus of albures. While the alburero would attempt to show the albureado as the bottom (passive sexual partner, ), he could as well name the female relatives of the albureado, namely sisters or, in case of great confidence, mother. However, it's a known fact that many Mexicans are over-reactive to this type of references and might be more easily moved to a physically violent response than by any other type of albur, or even overt insults.
However, in the case of female (female albur performers), the situation becomes quite complicated for the male albur performer, as the general counterattack strategy would be exhibiting the adversary as a sexual bottom, but women in albur are not trying to prove virility, only mental sharpness, and that type of attack does no harm. In this case, if the albureado has no comeback line, he suffers a double humiliation since he would not be able to respond to the albur, and he would also have been defeated by a woman, which makes it more humiliating for the macho Mexican mind among of a group of males.
Language and structure.
Albures can make use of several aspects of (empirical, innate) linguistic knowledge. For example, the phallic shape of the chili pepper adds a double meaning to the question, asked of a tourist, "Do you like Mexican chili?"
Phonetic.
Many albures originate from similarities in the pronunciation of different words:
which sounds like: "('Give it to me now')", a phrase which can connote "it" as being either the vagina or the anus, and therefore constituting an albur.
Polysemy.
Others make use of the fact that a word may have several meanings, one of which will be exploited.
For example, a Mexican bus driver may ask a passenger about , which can mean both "the stop" and "the erected one". Therefore, a wary passenger should be careful not to reply, e.g., "", which can mean "at the speedbump" but also "the whole thing" or "until it stops".
Pronominal references.
When the antecedent for a pronoun is substituted for a sexual reference the simplest (cheapest) form of albures can be achieved.
Using the same example as above,
Several examples can be easily constructed where the previous conversation would include antecedents for the clitic pronoun "" [fem, sing], and the albur comeback would re-reference it to mean the penis (among the several synonyms for penis, there are some with the correct gender and number agreement).
Generalization of meaning/context.
In this exchange, the interesting aspect is that b's response mechanism is simply to substitute the out-of-context "sad" for a's accusation. B's response would effectively be interpreted as "I see that you are dumb".
Some of the most renowned masters of the albur are "Chaf y Queli", who made several records in the 1970s under the "Discos Diablo" label.
, who wrote "", made a compilation of albures and other mexicanisms.

In the Studio

In the Studio is the third studio album by British ska revival band the Specials. It was released under the name the Special AKA in June 1984, their only album under that name. The album took over two years to produce before finally seeing release, by which time the original Specials had long since disbanded.
"In the Studio" charted in the UK Top 35. It was not as commercially successful as their previous two albums, although "(Free) Nelson Mandela" became an international hit single.
Critical reception.
Garry Johnson of "Sounds" said that Jerry Dammers had made "his most powerful statement to date" with "In the Studio", which Johnson described as "sublime agit-prop, a coolly sophisticated and masterfully varied modern pop cocktail", and "an album that marks not only the Special AKA's growth as a musical unit and their validity as political commentators, but also confirms Dammers' importance as a songwriter." In "Record Mirror", Dylan Jones stated that while it "isn't exactly a barrel of laughs, it's certain to worm its way into the hearts of millions for its solid plaintive tunes." Mark Ellen, writing for "Smash Hits", called the album "wonderfully crafted and restrained" both musically and lyrically, crediting it with making "sharp political points in a refreshingly reasoned and 'non-violent' manner" and ultimately deeming it "a little humourless, but still utterly worth the wait."
Offering more qualified praise in "NME", Cynthia Rose felt that the lyrics on "In the Studio" were inconsistent in quality, and lamented that the "undue dips into polemicism" and "sometimes clumsy vocal mixes" undermined the album's music, which she lauded as "unlike anything else around the UK just now." At the end of 1984, "In the Studio" was listed as the year's third-best album by "NME".
Reviewing "In the Studio" in retrospect, AllMusic critic Jo-Ann Greene noted its stark departure from the Specials' first two albums, observing a turn towards more unsettling music and an "ever darker" lyrical worldview, while "even the more accessible numbers have bite and exceedingly sharp edges". Greene opined that "where once there was thoughtful reasoning laced with sarcasm, here the coddling is gone, and even the irony is heavy-handed." "The Guardian"s Alexis Petridis concurred that "its worldview was so bleak as to make previous Specials albums... seem like the height of giddy gay abandon", and cited a "solitary misstep: repetitious and chorus-free, it keeps solemnly hammering its message home until it sounds like it's talking down to the listener". However, he found it otherwise "utterly compelling", concluding that "as complicated and awkward as you like, "In the Studio" sounds less like the noble failure it was held to be on release and more like the perfect coda to the Specials' career."

<doc id="6961771" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6961771" title="Principal ideal ring">
Principal ideal ring

In mathematics, a principal right (left) ideal ring is a ring "R" in which every right (left) ideal is of the form "xR" ("Rx") for some element "x" of "R". (The right and left ideals of this form, generated by one element, are called principal ideals.) When this is satisfied for both left and right ideals, such as the case when "R" is a commutative ring, "R" can be called a principal ideal ring, or simply principal ring.
If only the finitely generated right ideals of "R" are principal, then "R" is called a right Bézout ring. Left Bézout rings are defined similarly. These conditions are studied in domains as Bézout domains.
A principal ideal ring which is also an integral domain is said to be a "principal ideal domain" (PID). In this article the focus is on the more general concept of a principal ideal ring which is not necessarily a domain.
General properties.
If "R" is a principal right ideal ring, then it is certainly a right Noetherian ring, since every right ideal is finitely generated. It is also a right Bézout ring since all finitely generated right ideals are principal. Indeed, it is clear that principal right ideal rings are exactly the rings which are both right Bézout and right Noetherian.
Principal right ideal rings are closed under finite direct products. If formula_1, then each right ideal of "R" is of the form formula_2, where each formula_3 is a right ideal of "R"i. If all the "R"i are principal right ideal rings, then "A"i="x"i"R"i, and then it can be seen that formula_4. Without much more effort, it can be shown that right Bézout rings are also closed under finite direct products.
Principal right ideal rings and right Bézout rings are also closed under quotients, that is, if "I" is a proper ideal of principal right ideal ring "R", then the quotient ring "R/I" is also principal right ideal ring. This follows readily from the isomorphism theorems for rings.
All properties above have left analogues as well.
Structure theory for commutative PIR's.
The principal rings constructed in Example 5 above are always Artinian rings; in particular they are isomorphic to a finite direct product of principal Artinian local rings.
A local Artinian principal ring is called a special principal ring and has an extremely simple ideal structure: there are only finitely many ideals, each of which is a power of the maximal ideal. For this reason, special principal rings are examples of uniserial rings.
The following result gives a complete classification of principal rings in terms of special principal rings and principal ideal domains.
Zariski–Samuel theorem: Let "R" be a principal ring. Then "R" can be written as a direct product formula_25, where each "R"i is either a principal ideal domain or a special principal ring.
The proof applies the Chinese Remainder theorem to a minimal primary decomposition of the zero ideal.
There is also the following result, due to Hungerford:
Theorem (Hungerford): Let "R" be a principal ring. Then "R" can be written as a direct product formula_25, where each "R"i is a quotient of a principal ideal domain.
The proof of Hungerford's theorem employs Cohen's structure theorems for complete local rings.
Arguing as in Example 3. above and using the Zariski-Samuel theorem, it is easy to check that Hungerford's theorem is equivalent to the statement that any special principal ring is the quotient of a discrete valuation ring.
Noncommutative examples.
Every semisimple ring "R" which is not just a product of fields is a noncommutative right and left principal ideal ring (it need not be a domain, as the example of n x n matrices over a field shows). Every right and left ideal is a direct summand of "R", and so is of the form "eR" or "Re" where "e" is an idempotent of "R". Paralleling this example, von Neumann regular rings are seen to be both right and left Bézout rings.
If "D" is a division ring and formula_27 is a ring endomorphism which is not an automorphism, then the skew polynomial ring formula_28 is known to be a principal left ideal domain which is not right Noetherian, and hence it cannot be a principal right ideal ring. This shows that even for domains principal left and principal right ideal rings are different.

Nowy Dzień

Nowy Dzień (Polish for "New Day") was a short-lived Polish middle-market daily newspaper, which appeared from 14 November 2005 until 23 February 2006. "Nowy Dzień" was launched by the publishing company Agora SA, after its flagship publication Gazeta Wyborcza had come under increasing pressure from Fakt, a low-cost tabloid introduced by Axel Springer Polska in 2003.
"Nowy Dzień" was conceived as a "quality tabloid" with entertaining, but at the same time more serious journalism than that of typical tabloids such as "Fakt's" German "parent" product, Bild-Zeitung. The paper's editorial staff consisted mainly of detached "Gazeta Wyborcza" employees. The publisher envisaged an average circulation of 250,000 copies, but it remained continuously below that and had a downward trend. By early 2006, circulation had dropped from an initial level of 212,000 to about 130,000 copies. As a result, Agora S.A. decided to discontinue the paper. Since then, "Gazeta Wyborcza" has had to continue its increasingly difficult effort to appeal to both upmarket and middle-market readerships.

List of Canna cultivars

This list of "Canna" cultivars is a gallery of named cultivars of plants in the genus "Canna" that are representative of the various "Canna" cultivar groups (i.e., groups of very similar cultivars).
Names of cultivars conform to the rules of the International Society for Horticultural Science (ISHS) Commission for Nomenclature and Cultivar Registration, as laid down in the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants. They are registered with an International Cultivar Registration Authority (ICRA), which for the genus "Canna" is the Royal General Bulbgrowers' Association of the Netherlands (KAVB).
Foliage group.
Cultivars, F1 and F2 hybrids, normally with small species-like flowers, but grown principally for their foliage. This group has occasionally been referred to as the Année Group, after the originator, Théodore Année, the world's first "Canna" hybridizer. However, the use of an accented character in the name creates problems, both in pronunciation and keyboard entry, that it was felt that as they were grown primarily for foliage, then "Foliage Group" was the better name choice.
Crozy group.
A cultivar group where the flower spikes are arranged close together on the stalk and have narrow to medium petals. There is always space between the staminodes when arranged formally, and the labellum (lip) is smaller than the staminodes, and is often twisted or curled.
The pioneer of this group was Monsieur Crozy of Lyons, France, who started breeding cannas as early as 1862, from stock originally developed by Théodore Année.
They are sometimes referred to as gladiolus flowering cannas, but describing flowers as similar to another genus is not encouraged. In the past, they were called the "Canna" × "generalis" L.H. Bailey garden species, but the use of for complex garden hybrids have been replaced by Cultivar Groups in the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants.
Italian group.
A cultivar group with large, fragile staminodes. Flowers are arranged somewhat loosely, with wide petals, so wide that there is no space between them, when arranged formally. The labellum (lip) is larger, or at least as large, as the staminodes, unlike the other groups where it is smaller and sometimes curled. The stamen is also much wider than that in the other cultivar groups.
Also, used to be called the orchid flowering cannas, or "C." × "orchiodes" L.H. Bailey garden species, although such "pretend" species are now deprecated in favour of Cultivar Groups. In any event, it is difficult to see the similarity between this group and orchids.
Most of this group obtained its larger sized flowers from the introduction of "Canna flaccida" in the early 1890s by Dr Sprenger in Naples, Italy followed shortly afterwards by Luther Burbank in California, United States, with the same cross.
Australian group.
The result of a crossing of a Foliage Group seed parent with an Italian Group pollen parent ("C." 'Red Stripe' x "C." 'Bengal Tiger'), which resulted in the very large leaves of the Foliage Group allied with large flowers.
Premier group.
This grouping contains cultivars that have a large, circular shape, without gaps between the staminodes when ordered. These are derived from triploids and crosses with the Italian Group cultivars.
Variegated group.
Cultivars with variegated foliage, regardless of what other Group they may belong to.
Conservatory group.
The growing conditions in a conservatory are quite specialised and do not suit many cultivars, this group have been selected for thriving in this environment, required features being plant vigor, early flowering, foliar appearance, self-cleaning ability and good propagation qualities. The originator of this group was Robert Armstrong (geneticist) while he was working at Longwood Gardens in the United States in 1967.
Aquatic group.
Cultivars that thrive as marginal water plants. Characteristically, they will have lance-shaped foliage and long, thin rhizomes.
Miniature group.
Cultivars growing under 0.5m (19") high, the flowers should be in scale to the rest of the plant.
Agriculture group.
Cultivars grown selectively for agricultural usage, normally for their very large rhizomes and a high starch yield. See Canna Agriculture Group for more details.
Musaefolia Group.
The Musaefolia Group, having large leaves and being either tall or giant in size consists of cultivars whose leaves resemble those of banana plants (genus "Musa"). Until this group was designated, the cultivars were considered to be members of the Foliage Group.
