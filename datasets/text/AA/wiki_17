The Derelict (short story)

The Derelict is a short story by William Hope Hodgson, first published in 1912.
As he does in many of his stories, Hodgson employs a framework or "story within a story." In the framework, an elderly ship's doctor recounts a strange event that happened to him some years earlier, in the context of discussing his ideas about a fundamental life force that can manifest itself in the presence of proper materials.
While sailing as a passenger, a sudden storm disables the ship. In the aftermath, a derelict vessel is discovered. A small boat is sent to investigate, since from a distance the shape of the vessel seems to indicate that it is surprisingly ancient. The captain is interested in possible salvage.
Upon boarding the vessel, the investigators discover that it is encased in a thick fungus-like encrustation. In order to go below the deck, the captain kicks the encrustation, which begins to spurt a reddish fluid, and a rhythmic thudding like a heartbeat is heard. The solid surface of the encrustation begins softening and heaving, becoming mobile and gelatinous, and actually begins to dissolve the shoes of the investigators, as if it is attempting to digest them.
As events escalate, the lantern is dropped and extinguished; in the frantic attempt that follows to escape the vessel, a crewman is killed as he falls on the undulating surface and it envelopes and dissolves his body. The doctor and the captain manage to get over the side into an old lifeboat where they beat off a pseudopod and manage to escape back to their own vessel.
The doctor believes that the particular combination of cargo aboard the derelict, as it decayed, may have resulted in spontaneous generation of a new life form.

Full House Kiss

 is a "shōjo" manga as well as a PlayStation 2 otome game. The manga was created at the same time as the video game, and was drawn by Shiori Yuwa and published in Hana to Yume &amp; The Hana to Yume. The video game used the same character designs and plot in a love simulation published by Capcom in 2004. A sequel to the video game, called "Full House Kiss 2", was released in 2006.
Plot.
Suzuhara Mugi, a 15-year-old girl, is determined to get onto the campus of the elite Shoukei high school. Mugi is searching for her missing sister—her only remaining family—and she has been led to believe that someone or something on the campus of that school will help her in her search. Unfortunately the strict school security is preventing her from getting onto the school grounds.
However, her luck changes when she runs into Midou-kun, the son of a rich mega-corporation president, and an elite person at the school. Midou is smug and arrogant, but he eventually strikes up a deal with Mugi—he will get her onto the school grounds, but she must come to his house and work as a maid. He lives with 3 other boys, known as the La Princes in the super elite school.
Her optimism and cheerfulness makes her attractive to the four boys. As the manga progresses, the romantic feelings of the boys start surfacing.
Characters.
Princes of Shoukei Academy.

Gameplay.
Most of the gameplay is focused on housekeeping tasks. Every day after you get back from school, you have chores asked of you by each household member and a finite amount of time to get them done. You do them well or badly depending on choices you make. At the end of the evening, the boys all visit you to report on how you did.
In addition to the chores, you can also 'encounter' the boys in rooms around the house, which can lead to some minigames or just dialogue.
The larger aspect of the game is solving your sister's disappearance. This is done while you're at school, and after school hours. You have to act like a teacher to keep suspicion away, but you also have to investigate.
There is also the dating aspect. Doing the chores well will increase your standing with characters, as will successfully completing the relevant minigame. There are also some scenes with the boys where you have to choose your reactions, which will also make a difference. There are also some events which you can do with one of the boys, usually the one that you have the highest standing with.

Carpenter (theatre)

In theatre, a carpenter is a stagehand who builds sets and stage elements. They usually are hired by the production manager, crew chief or technical director. In some less common cases, they may be hired by the director, or producer. They are usually paid by the hour.
Carpenters receive drafting from the technical director who uses the designers' renderings, models, and/or drafting of the set to create the technical drawings for the production. Working mainly with woods and metals, they use techniques that include woodworking and welding. They build set pieces, including some standard elements—flats, platforms and columns—as well as pieces of the stage. For example, a carpenter may be responsible for building stairs and ramps on and off of the performance area and for leveling the stage floor itself.
Only carpenters trained as riggers are trusted to do rigging (see fly crew). Often union houses and some larger theatres make distinctions between carpenters and riggers, but most smaller theatres do not, due to staffing limitations. 
Professional carpenters do not work on anything with an electrical component (see electrician). They also do not paint the set, as this is the job of a scenic artist.
Often, stage carpentry for a large production is organized with one "master carpenter" or "shop foreman" and many subordinate carpenters.

Michael A. Hoffman

Michael Allen Hoffman (October 14, 1944– April 23, 1990) was an American archaeologist, Egyptologist, and author.
Life.
Michael A. Hoffman was born in Washington, D.C., on October 14, 1944, and was raised in Virginia although he spent a lot of vacation time in Ohio. In 1966, he graduated from the University of Kentucky with a B.A. He got his M.A. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and in 1971, he received his Ph.D.
Hoffman went to Egypt for the first time in 1969, where he joined the American Museum of Natural History's Hierakonpolis Expedition. He helped in the excavation of the ancient city of Nekhen and spent time at Locality Hk14. This was the first excavation of a Predynastic Upper Egyptian settlement in over 35 years.
On an excavation in 1984, he used sludge pumps to keep the site dry which paid off because he found a stratigraphic link from Dynasty 1 to Naqada 1.
Hoffman was the director of the Archaeology Laboratory at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville from 1972 to 1979 and was an associate professor in sociology and anthropology at Western Illinois University. He became a research professor in the Earth Sciences and Resources Institute at the University of South Carolina in Columbia.
His book "Egypt before the Pharaohs: the Prehistoric Foundations of Egyptian Civilization" was published in 1979.
Hoffman re-established excavations of Hierakonpolis in 1979–80. He took Barbara Adams as one of his experts.
Death and legacy.
Hoffman died from cancer on April 23, 1990. After Hoffmann's death in 1990, James O. Mills and Walter Fairservis served as codirectors of the Hierakonpolis expedition.
His life's work led to a fresh appreciation of Egypt's predynastic past and how it culminated into statehood.
"Egypt Before the Pharaohs" was shown in the 1994 film "Stargate" by Roland Emmerich.

2006 South Ossetian independence referendum

South Ossetia, a mostly unrecognized republic in the South Caucasus, formerly the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast within the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic with its capital in Tskhinvali, held a referendum on independence on November 12, 2006.
Referendum.
The voters in the independence referendum organized by Tskhinvali answered the question: "Should the republic of South Ossetia retain its current status as an independent State, and be recognized by the international community?"
Parallel to the referendum and elections, the Georgia-backed Ossetian opposition movement organized its own elections in Eredvi, inhabited by ethnic Georgians, in which five Ossetian presidential candidates opposed to Eduard Kokoity took part. On the alternative referendum the voters answered the following question: "Should South Ossetia engage in discussions with Tbilisi concerning a federal State uniting it with Georgia?" According to the Electoral Commission of Alternative Elections, 42,000 voters turned out for the elections held in the territories under Georgian control, but Tskhinvali claimed that the voters numbered only 14,000. Dmitry Sanakoyev was elected by 88% of voters as the alternative President of South Ossetia.
Results.
On 13 November 2006, the Central Election Commission of South Ossetia announced the results of the referendum. 99% of voters supported independence, with voter turnout at 95%.
Reactions.
The Georgian government has declared both the election and the referendum illegal, but it was believed to support the Salvation Union of Ossetians, the organization in charge of holding the alternative elections. Kokoity thus accused Tbilisi of staging the alternative elections that aimed at "dividing the Ossetian people".
On 12 September 2006, the Chairman of the Russian State Duma, Boris Gryzlov, welcomed the appointed South Ossetian referendum and announced that Russian parliamentarians would observe the voting process. On 13 September 2006, the Georgian State Minister for Conflict Resolution Issues, Merab Antadze, issued a statement, condemning Gryzlov's statement as "destructive."
The European Union Special Representative to the South Caucasus, Peter Semneby, downplayed the forthcoming South Ossetian referendum and said in Moscow, on 13 September 2006, that the referendum would not contribute to the conflict resolution process in South Ossetia.
On 13 September 2006, the Council of Europe (CoE) Secretary General Terry Davis commented on the problem, stating that:
The head of the Institute of CIS Countries and the member of the Russian State Duma, Konstantin Zatulin, is quoted during his visit to Artsakh in October 2006, where he spoke only about Artsakh and Transnistria, as saying:
On 2 October 2006, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Chairman-in-Office, Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht, said during his visit to Tbilisi:
On 11 November 2006, Secretary General of NATO Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said in a statement:
On 11 November 2006, Luis Tascón, a member of the National Assembly of Venezuela, said during a press-conference in Tskhinvali: "Those people who wish to be free, will be free."
He also hinted that Venezuela might eventually recognize the South Ossetian independence, claiming that president Chávez would make a correct decision. He also noted that his presence in Tskhinvali did not guarantee the recognition the South Ossetian independence by Venezuelan Government.
On 11 November 2006, Sergei Fyodorov, an observer and Latvian Parliament member of Russian nationality, and a member of Socialist Party, stated during a press-conference in Tskhinvali that all peoples had the right for self-determination, and it could not be ignored. He also made a commitment to inform the other members of the Latvian Saeima of his observations.
On 13 November 2006, the European Union foreign ministers said that the vote did not contribute to conflict resolution. The OSCE and the Council of Europe reiterated that they would not recognize the referendum and condemned it as unproductive. An EU statement was later joined by Ukraine.

Starehe Boys' Centre and School

Starehe Boys' Centre and School (popularly known as "Starehe") is a partial-board, boys-only school in Nairobi, Kenya. The school was founded in 1959 by Dr. Geoffrey William Griffin, MBS, OBE, Geoffrey Gatama Geturo and Joseph Kamiru Gikubu. It started as a rescue centre in Nairobi. The school is a member of the Round Square network of schools.
Status.
Starehe Boys' Centre and School educates at least 70% of its students for free, and the rest at a reduced rate. This stems from its founding charter as a charitable school. School fees are paid on a means-tested basis, with substantial subsidies paid by the school, so that students from all walks of life are able to have a public school education that would otherwise be beyond their means.
The entrance process uses results from the national KCPE exams and prefers to award school places to those who show academic potential.
The school is governed by a Managing Committee chaired by David Mureithi, Former Managing Director of Unilever East and Southern Africa, former Managing Director of Unilever West Africa, and Executive Vice President of Vivo Energy. Vivo Energy Kenya (formerly Kenya Shell) is one of the school's main sponsors since its inception.
Admissions.
Admission of students is by open competitive examination. Each year, approximately 20,000 applications are received; only 250 are selected to join the student body, and about six places are reserved for very needy situations where the applicant might not have had the opportunity to apply but is still meritorious.
Candidates are judged according to need and parental income, and their performance in the national KCPE examinations. Selection is solely on merit.
History.
Starehe Boys' Centre was the result of the vision of Geoffrey William Griffin, assisted by Joseph Gikubu, and Geoffrey Geturo. Its genesis was the earlier State of Emergency declared by the Governor of Colonial Kenya during the 1952 Mau Mau Uprising and the resultant overflow on to the streets of poor and destitute Mau Mau orphans.
The first 17 boys entered the school from Kariokor Rescue Centre, Nairobi, and it was established in two tin huts donated by Kenya Shell and BP in 1959. After a few months it moved to its current location at Starehe, Nairobi.
The name "Starehe" is Swahili for 'Tranquility', 'Peace', or 'Comfort', signifying a place where orphaned boys could find solace in its humble beginnings. It is also the name of the place in which the institution is situated.
The school is a member of the international Round Square school organisation, offering education to children from diverse backgrounds, many of whom are poor.
Traditions.
The school uniform is blue short trousers and red shirt, worn with a black tie and blazer or wind-breaker.
Links with the country and the community are maintained, with a monthly vacation spent in voluntary service to the community, either in hospitals, clinics, dispensaries or government offices, or any other institution that the students deem fit. This is referred to as the Voluntary Service Scheme, and is a way of giving back to society.
Starehe hosts an annual football grudge match against Lenana School immediately before Founders' Day Dinner.
Accommodation.
Students take 'githeri' (mixture of beans and maize), a staple of the school since its inception. Starehe's education places emphasis on academic excellence as well as duty and discipline. An inscription at the Assembly Hall entrance reads "the path of Duty is the way to Glory".
Students perform daily duties that include cleaning their dormitories and the school compound as well as classes and laboratories. These duties are assigned and supervised by the prefects.
Discipline.
Starehe follows a rank-based prefect system. A student may become a prefect from the second year at the school but never are full prefects. They only bear the rank of sub-prefect and are so confirmed during assembly where the Director announces their promotion. Promotion through the ranks is assessed by School Prefects (normally referred to as House Captains), who form the Cabinet of the School. Any potential prefect is vetted by the Cabinet, which consists of the School Prefects, the School Captains and the Director.
Commoners are divided according to year. Those in Form One and Two are Junior Boys, Form Three and Four are Senior boys. Starehe also has a technical training institute called Starehe Technical Training Institute for post Secondary education. Starehe Institute students are referred to as "Form Five's".
When corporal punishment was legal in Kenya, only the Director was allowed to use the cane at Starehe. This was so that he kept abreast of all serious offences in the school.
Dr. Griffin took issue with the government's ban on caning, saying the government was bowing to international pressure and that little thought had been given to the implications. It would lead to an escalation in indiscipline and a decline in educational standards, he said.
Notable alumni.
 
Starehe UK.
Starehe UK was founded in 1970 to help support Starehe Boys' Centre. In 1994–1996 it raised over £1M through the Aim High Appeal to establish an endowment fund in the UK for the Centre. It has supported Starehe Girls' Centre since its founding. 2009 was the fiftieth anniversary of the Starehe Boys' Centre. The Girls' Centre was opened in 2005.

The Troubles in Bessbrook

The Troubles in Bessbrook recounts incidents during and the effects of the Troubles in Bessbrook, County Armagh, Northern Ireland.
Bessbrook saw some of the worst violence in the Troubles. 25 British soldiers and local Protestants, all male, lost their lives. Four soldiers died in a non-combat related air accident, but the rest (21 men) were killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA).
The linen mill was converted by the British Army into a major military base. A helicopter landing area was established to supply other military outposts in the area since road-borne movements of troops and supplies were vulnerable to landmine attack. At one stage the little village was reportedly the busiest helicopter airport in Europe, more so than the major heliports supplying the North Sea oil rigs. For many years British Army helicopters would take off and land every few minutes. To avoid the risk of missile attack they would fly at rooftop level over the village. For a time, direct access to much of the village was sealed off by security barriers to minimise the risk of vehicle-borne bomb attacks on the security forces. Some have claimed that this contributed to the commercial decline of local businesses.

Chronis Aidonidis

Chronis Aidonidis (; 23 September 1928 – 23 October 2023) was a Greek singer from Karoti, a village now belonging to Didymoteicho, Greece. His parents were Fr. Christos and Chrysanthi Aidonidis. He learned his first songs in his hometown and was introduced to traditional music by his mother and the musicians who used to play at the local fairs.
Biography.
Aidonidis was taught Byzantine music, first by his father, and later by professor Michalis Kefalokoptis. In 1950, he came to live in Athens with his parents, where he completed his studies in Byzantine music at the Hellenic Conservatory with teacher Theodoros Hadjitheodorou. In March of the same year, he was hired at the Sismanogleion Hospital, where he worked as an accountant. In 1953, folklore scientist Polydoros Papachristodoulou offered for him to participate in his radio show entitled "Echoes from Thrace", which presented music from his homeland.
Chronis Aidonidis released records with songs from northern, eastern and western Thrace. He participated in hundreds of musical events in Greece and abroad, in places such as the Americas, Australia, the former Soviet Union, and Europe. One step of his artistic journey was his collaboration with the Greek singer George Dalaras for the release of the CD "Nightingales from the Orient" in March 1990. Another was when the University of Crete released the double CD "Songs and Tunes from Thrace" in 1993.
Later, he collaborated with his student, Nektaria Karantzi, for the release of the double CD "When the Roads Meet", in which he recorded "Byzantine Ecclesiastical Hymns" for the first time and the CD "He was Grieved", in which he and Karantzi recorded 40 Byzantine hymns of the Holy Week and a folk lament.
In 2001, he collaborated with Nikos Kypourgos for the release of a CD entitled "Secrets from the Garden". During the Olympic Games of Athens in 2004, Chronis Aidonidis greeted all the guests of Greece by singing the song "Welcome My Friends". In 2005, he participated in the Easter television show made by Hellenic Television entitled "He Was Grieved", in which he sang Byzantine hymns of the Holy Week. In 2006, he participated in the 6th Festival of Sacred Music in Patmos, along with Karantzi and the ecclesiastical Byzantine choir, Glorifier (led by Dimitris Verykios).
Aidonidis taught traditional singing at the Zisis Foundation and the Central Conservator in the Chalandri suburb of Athens. He was the artistic director of the Center for the Study of the Musical Tradition of Thrace, Asia Minor and Euxeinos Pontos, as well as the creator and leader of the Workshop for Traditional Music in Alexandroupoli. He was also one of the founders of the Archive of Greek Music.
Chronis Aidonidis died on 23 October 2023 at the age of 95.

Linda Willis

Linda Kay Willis (born July 20, 1949) was a close witness during the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy.
When the assassination started, she was located to the left of President Kennedy's presidential limousine on the south side of Elm Street, directly in front of the Texas School Book Depository. In the Zapruder film, she was seen wearing a blue coat and a long gold skirt.
Willis testified to the Warren Commission in 1964 that she remembered hearing three shots, with the last two shots bunched much closer together than the first two shots. Specifically, she also testified that the assassination started when President Kennedy was already waving (his waving motion does not start until Zapruder film frame 174) when she heard the first shot (from Z-165 through Z-208, the president was hidden by a large oak tree from the view of anyone located in the Warren Commission lone snipers lair). Like many Dealey Plaza witnesses, the first shot she remembered hearing sounded like a firecracker to her. She said that this first shot hit President Kennedy because she saw the president immediately (and almost simultaneously) raise up both his arms and clench his fists in front of his throat as a result of the first shot that she remembered. Willis stated that she did not know where the second shot that she remembered hearing came from or went to. She said that it was the third shot that she remembered that hit President Kennedy in his head. In 1978, Willis told the House Select Committee on Assassinations that she "had a distinct impression that the head wound to President Kennedy was a result of a front-to-rear shot" when she saw his head "blow up." In her 1989 video interview for "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" documentary, Willis stated that when she saw the president's head explode in blood that she saw brain matter come out the back of the president's head, so, the head shot must have been fired from the front of President Kennedy.
Willis stated to assassination researcher and author Richard Trask ("Pictures of the Pain" 1994) that after the assassination, she and her sister Rosemary also saw someone find a piece of the president's head that had landed in the grass located at least to the left of the president.
After the assassination, Willis, along with her sister, father (Phillip) and mother (Marilyn), were present at the Kodak photographic laboratory getting her father's assassination-related photo slides developed when the Zapruder film was first developed and first shown.

Prix Dollar

The Prix Dollar is a Group 2 flat horse race in France open to thoroughbreds aged three years or older. It is run at Longchamp over a distance of 1,950 metres (about 1 mile and 1¾ furlongs), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late September or early October.
History.
The event is named after Dollar, a successful racehorse and sire in the 19th century. It was established in 1905, and was initially contested over 3,500 metres in the autumn. It was moved to the spring and cut to 2,200 metres in 1909. It was abandoned throughout World War I, with no running from 1915 to 1918.
In 1934, the race was titled the Prix du Centenaire to commemorate the centenary of the sport's main governing body at that time, the Société d'Encouragement. The Prix du Centenaire was a 2,100-metre handicap with a prize of 318,600 francs.
The Prix Dollar was cancelled from 1940 to 1943 because of World War II. It was staged at Le Tremblay with a distance of 2,150 metres in 1944 and 1945. For a period it was restricted to horses aged four or older.
The race was shortened to 2,000 metres in 1957, and extended to 2,250 metres in 1958. It reverted to 2,000 metres in 1960, and was held at Chantilly in 1965 and 1966. A new distance of 1,950 metres was introduced in 1969.
The Prix Dollar was run at Chantilly's Prix du Jockey Club meeting over 2,000 metres in 1986. It was switched to Longchamp's late September fixture in 1987. It was opened to three-year-olds and moved to the Saturday of Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe weekend in 1988. The latter race is traditionally held on the first Sunday of October.

Andre Anderson (boxer)

Andre Anderson (1890 in Chicago, Illinois – April 1, 1926) was an American boxer from 1915 until his death in 1926. He was best known for knocking down and drawing the World Heavyweight Champion Jack Dempsey on 24 June 1916 in a match held in the Bronx, New York.
It was alleged that Anderson would take dives for organized crime gamblers, which led to his shooting death, reportedly after refusing to partake in further bribes.
Hemingway connection.
Because of proximity (Chicago), profession and death at the hands of the mob, the young writer Ernest Hemingway was almost certainly aware of Anderson. Hemingway likely used him as the basis for Andreson 'the Swede' in his short stories 'A Matter of Colour' and 'The Killers'.

Nuclear protein

A nuclear protein is a protein found in the cell nucleus. Proteins are transported inside the nucleus with they help of the nuclear pore complex, which acts a barrier between cytoplasm and nuclear membrane. Many nuclear proteins contain positively charged amino acids such as Lysine and Arginine which acts as a signal to allow the protein to get transported into the nucleus while maintaining their fold. The import and export of proteins through the nuclear pore complex plays a fundamental role in gene regulation and other biological functions.
The Nuclear Protein Database (NPD) is a database of proteins thought or known to be localized to the cell nucleus from over 1300 species of vertebrates.

Lisa Sthalekar

 
Lisa Carprini Sthalekar (born 13 August 1979) is an Australian cricket commentator and former cricketer and captain of the Australia women's national cricket team. In domestic cricket, she represented New South Wales. She was a right-handed all rounder who bowled off spin, and was rated as the leading all rounder in the world when rankings were introduced. She was the first woman to score 1,000 runs and take 100 wickets in ODIs. She announced her retirement from international cricket a day after the Australian team won the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup.
Sthalekar made her debut in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL) late in 1997–98 as a specialist bowler, but had little success, totalling 1/120 in her maiden campaign. She improved her performance over the next two seasons, taking 8 and 15 wickets respectively. In three years, she scored only 169 runs with a best score of 33. In 2000–01 Sthalekar took 11 wickets and scored 112 runs in the WNCL and was called into the Australian team for the first time. Playing as a bowler, she made her One Day International (ODI) debut against England and ended the tour of the British Isles with five wickets from as many matches.
In 2001–02, Sthalekar developed into a frontline batter. She made her first half-century, compiling four in all for the season. She totalled 347 runs, more than her four previous seasons combined, and took 11 wickets as New South Wales won their sixth consecutive WNCL with a clean sweep. Sthalekar struggled with the ball in the next two international seasons, taking only eight wickets in 12 matches, but she did break through with the bat at international level, making three half-centuries in six matches. In early 2003, she made her Test debut against England, and made 120 not out, her maiden century, in her second match, although she took only three wickets in the two Tests.
In 2003–04 and the following season, Sthalekar took 14 wickets apiece and reached 250 runs in each season. In internationals, she returned to form with the ball and averaged more than a wicket per ODI. Sthalekar played in each match of Australia's unbeaten 2005 World Cup triumph in South Africa, taking seven wickets in all, and scoring 55 against India in the final.
After the World Cup, Australia toured the British Isles and Sthalekar made her maiden ODI century against Ireland. She took seven wickets in the two-Test series against England, and upon returning to Australia, made 72 and took 5/30 in an innings win over India. Sthalekar had a strong 2006–07 international season with the bat, scoring 604 runs at 67.11, passing 40 in 9 of her 12 innings, but struggled with the ball, taking 10 wickets at 41.00. In 2007–08, she missed out on a second Test century, falling for 98 in a one-off match against England. She ended the season with consecutive ODI fifties against New Zealand and won the Belinda Clark Award for both 2007 and 2008. She started the following summer with unbeaten scores of 73 and 104 against India, before taking 4/20 in the next match to help set up a clean sweep of the ODI series.
Sthalekar led New South Wales to five consecutive WNCL titles starting in 2005–06. During this period, she averaged over 40 with the bat and just over 20 with the ball, scoring more than 1400 runs and taking 60 wickets. She reached her maiden WNCL century in 2009–10 having ended unbeaten in the nineties on two occasions in the five-year period.
During the 2009 World Cup held in New South Wales and Canberra, Sthalekar was Australia's leading wicket-taker with 13 wickets at 15.69 but struggled with the bat, making 70 runs at 14.00 as Australia lost the third-place playoff to India. In early 2010, Sthalekar took 5/35, he best ODI bowling figures, in her 100th match. Australia defeated New Zealand in all eight ODIs and Sthalekar was prominent with the ball, taking 12 wickets from seven matches. In August 2020, she was inducted to the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.
Birth and adoption.
Originally named Laila at birth, Sthalekar was born in the city of Pune in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. Her biological parents, who were unable to support her, placed her at Shreevatsa, an orphanage attached to Pune's Sassoon Hospital. Haren and Sue Sthalekar, Lisa's adoptive parents, were a couple who lived in Michigan, United States. Haren was born in Bombay and Sue to English parents. The Sthalekars had a daughter and were in India visiting Shreevatsa, hoping to adopt a boy to complete the family. Unsuccessful in their search and about to leave Shreevatsa, it was suggested that they meet Laila. Sue fell in love with her big brown eyes and within a short period of time they decided to adopt her. They thus completed the necessary legal formalities and renamed Laila as Lisa. Three weeks after her birth, Sthalekar's family brought her back to the United States. The family travelled onto Kenya for a period for Haren's work as a Christian missionary before eventually settling in Sydney. Lisa Sthalekar visited Shreevatsa on 3 March 2012.
Early years.
Sthalekar was introduced to cricket by her father in backyard games, saying "I think cricket runs in the blood of all Indians." She played against boys initially, and was not aware that females played cricket until her father took her to a women's Test match between Australia and England at North Sydney Oval. She then joined the Gordon club on the North Shore region Sydney; playing with the boys on the weekend mornings before competing with the women during the afternoon.
Sthalekar attended primary schooling at Cherrybrook Public School (playing for West Pennant Hills Cherrybrook Cricket Club), early high school years at Cherrybrook Technology High School and later attended Barker College, a private Anglican school on the North Shore of Sydney. She later completed a Bachelor of Arts at Sydney University, majoring in psychology and religious studies.
Domestic beginnings.
Sthalekar made her debut for New South Wales towards the end of the 1997–98 season, against Queensland. She started as primarily a bowler who batted in the lower order and in her first match took 0/19 from six overs and was not required to bat as New South Wales won by five wickets. She played in five matches including the finals series against South Australia. In the first match, she took 1/22 from ten overs in a six-wicket victory, her maiden wicket at senior level in her fourth match, and in the second final, she only bowled five overs for 0/23. She was unbeaten on six when New South Wales reached their target with four wickets in hand to win the finals 2–0 and win the WNCL for the second year in a row. Sthalekar ended her maiden WNCL series with 25 runs at 25.00 and one wicket at 120.00 at an economy rate of 3.00.
Sthalekar was selected for the Under-23 national team at the end of the season to play a series against New Zealand A. Though economical in three one-dayers, she was not incisive, taking two wickets at 40.50 and an economy rate of 3.00 and scoring 22 runs at 7.33. She had more success in the non-limited-overs two-innings match, scoring 6 and 22 and taking a total of 5/91 in an Australian win. She bowled 62.1 overs for the match.
In 1998–99, Sthalekar had more success in the WNCL. She batted in the middle-order on occasions and scored 76 runs at 19.00 from four innings in seven matches. She took wickets in all but one match, ending with eight at 21.87. New South Wales met Victoria in the finals and Sthalekar scored 33 before being run out and took 2/21 in a seven-run win. It was Sthalekar's best bowling and batting analysis for the season. They then won the next match by one run to seal a hat-trick of WNCL titles, Sthalekar scoring one and taking 1/19 from her ten overs.
In 1999–2000, Sthalekar again had few opportunities with the bat in the middle and lower order as opposition bowlers struggled to make inroads into the New South Wales batting. She scored 68 runs at 34.00 from five innings in ten matches. Sthalekar took 15 wickets at 16.00 at an economy rate of 3.15, including four three-wicket hauls; all four matches ended in a New South Wales victory. All of these came in a period of six matches from the end of October to the start of December and included consecutive three-wicket hauls against Queensland and Victoria. Her best result was a 3/15 to help dismiss South Australia, before scoring 17 not out in a seven-wicket win. New South Wales again made the finals and after taking 2/27 from six overs in a 19-run win over Western Australia in the first match, she took 1/43 from ten overs the next day and made her top-score of the season, compiling an unbeaten 21 in the lower order to help New South Wales to victory by three wickets and claim their fourth successive WNCL, winning all but one of their matches.
At the end of the season, Sthalekar was selected in the Australia Under-21 team to play against New Zealand A. In her first match she scored 81 before being run out, but this was not enough to prevent a five-wicket defeat. The New Zealand attacked her bowling during the match, taking 45 runs from her nine overs without losing a wicket. She took one wicket in each of the next two matches as Australia won by ten and nine wickets respectively, before scoring 27—again run out—and taking 3/39 in the fourth match to help secure a 15-run win. She ended the series with 108 runs at 54.00 and six wickets at 22.50 and an economy rate of 3.46.
In 2000–01, Sthalekar again played in all ten matches of New South Wales' fifth consecutive WNCL title. She struggled in the first three matches, taking only one wicket and scoring 21 runs. In the fourth match, she scored 31 as New South Wales were dismissed for only 174, and took 0/30 from nine overs as Queensland inflicted New South Wales's first loss of the season, by two wickets. After taking 3/23 against Western Australia in the fifth match of the season, she prepared for the finals by scoring 23 and then taking 4/7 from 8.2 overs against Victoria in the last qualifying match, sealing a 69-run win. In the first final against Queensland, she made 43 and conceded only 20 runs from her ten overs as the defending champions dismissed their opponents for 201 to seal a 33-run victory. In the second match, she took 1/18 from her ten overs and fell for a duck as New South Wales won by seven wickets to complete a 2–0 finals series win. The only defeat of the season was a narrow two-wicket loss to Queensland in the fourth match of the season. Sthalekar scored 112 runs at 18.66 and took 11 wickets at 17.45 with an economy rate of 2.25.
One Day International debut.
These performances earned Sthalekar a call-up into the Australian team for the tour of England in mid-2001. She was overlooked for the one-off Test and made her international debut in the first One Day International (ODI) at County Ground, Derby, playing in a specialist bowler's position. She made one not out at the death as Australia batted first and made 7/238. She then took 2/25 from eight overs as the tourists dismissed England to seal a 99-run win. The next ODI at County Ground, Northampton was similar. She made four not out in Australia's 9/227 and took 1/24 from ten overs in a 118-run victory. Sthalekar was then left out of the team for the third and final ODI, so she missed out on the opportunity to play at Lord's, the home of cricket. The Australians then headed west to Dublin, Ireland to play three ODIs against the hosts' national team. Sthalekar played in all the matches and scored eight runs at 4.00 and took two wickets at 26.00 with an economy rate of 3.21, being run out in each match.
The Australians returned home and Sthalekar was part of the New South Wales team that won their sixth consecutive WNCL title in 2001–02, this time with a clean sweep of all ten matches. During the season, Sthalekar's batting reached new heights. She took 2/34 and then scored an unbeaten 80—her maiden WNCL half-century—to see New South Wales to a six-wicket win over Queensland in the third match of the season. In the double-header against Western Australia, she scored 66 and 60, the latter innings terminated by a run out. She later took 2/14 from ten overs to help restrict Victoria to 8/116, handing New South Wales a six-wicket win in their closest match of the season. New South Wales hosted the finals series against Victoria. In the first match, she took 1/16 from eight overs in Victoria's 133 all out and then scored 31 in a seven-wicket win. The next day, she took 2/22 from her 10 overs and then made 68 to set up a four-wicket win. She was not on hand when the target of 187 was reached, having been run out. She ended the season with 347 runs at 38.55 and 11 wickets at 24.00 at an economy rate of 3.14. Sthalekar has scored more runs in one season than she had done in her first four.
At the end of the season, Sthalekar played in four matches for Australia Youth against New Zealand A before the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand. Her batting was not effective, yielding 21 runs at 4.25, but she was incisive and economical with the ball, taking five wickets at 4.80 and economy rate of 1.33. Seven of her 18 overs were maidens. In the Rose Bowl series, Australia hosted three ODIs before travelling to New Zealand for three more matches. Sthalekar performed steadily but unspectacularly during the series. She took one wicket in the first five matches before failing to dismiss anyone in the final ODI, ending with five wickets at 38.00 and an economy rate of 4.31. She scored 88 runs at 17.60, making 33 in the first and last matches. Australia won all but the fourth match of the series.
New South Wales' run of six consecutive WNCL titles came to an end in 2002–03, during which Sthalekar had a mediocre season by her standards, scoring 180 runs at 20.00 and taking eight wickets at 37.37 at an economy rate of 3.35 in ten matches. She took more than one wicket only once, with 2/11 from ten overs against South Australia and had a run of four consecutive single-figure scores in the middle of the season. New South Wales won six of their eight matches and had to play the finals away against Victoria. In the first match, she scored 29 and was then attacked by the home batsmen, taking 1/45 in a three-wicket loss. The next day, she took 1/31 as the hosts were dismissed for 181, but in reply, the defending champions could only make 141 all out, of which Sthalekar made 45.
At the end of the season, Sthalekar competed in a quadrangular ODI tournament held in Lincoln, New Zealand. In addition to the hosts and Australia, England and India were also competing. Each team played two matches against the other three teams in the round-robin phase before the top two teams played off in the final. Sthalekar played in all but the fourth round-robin match, against England, as Australia won all seven matches, defeating the hosts 214 to 105 in the final. Sthalekar was not prominent with the ball, taking three wickets at 51.33, although she remained economical, conceding 3.58 runs per over. However, she was effective with the bat, scoring 59, her maiden ODI half-century, in the first match against New Zealand, before making consecutive half-centuries in the last two qualifying matches, 58 not out and 53 against India and New Zealand respectively. She ended the series with 189 runs at 37.80.
Test debut.
Australia then hosted England in two Tests in late February. Sthalekar made her debut in the First Test at the Gabba in Brisbane. She is the 143rd woman to play Test cricket for Australia. In a low-scoring match, she bowled 11 overs, taking 1/8 as the tourists made 124 batting first. Her maiden Test wicket was that of English captain Clare Connor, caught by Cathryn Fitzpatrick. Sthalekar was then given the duty of opening the batting alongside captain Belinda Clark. She was not successful as Australia then collapsed to be all out for 78; Sthalekar made six from 14 balls and occupied the crease for 13 minutes before being trapped lbw by Lucy Pearson in her maiden Test innings. After taking 1/16 from 15 overs, removing Claire Taylor caught behind by wicket-keeper Julia Price, and catching Clare Taylor from Fitzpatrick, England was all out for 92. Sthalekar again opened and this time made a duck, batting for 20 balls and 26 minutes without scoring, but Australia managed to reach 5/139 to seal victory. Of the 26 overs she bowled in the match, half were maidens.
Sthalekar was retained for the Second Test at Bankstown Oval in her home town Sydney, but after her failure as an opener in the preceding match, she returned to her conventional position in the middle-order. In the restructuring in the batting line-up, Kris Britt was called in to make her Test debut as an opener alongside Clark, and middle-order batsman Michelle Goszko was omitted to accommodate Sthalekar. Australia batted first and collapsed to be 3/25, bringing Sthalekar in to join Mel Jones. Sthalekar made 18 from 94 balls, combining with Jones for a 65-run partnership in 99 minutes to steady the innings. She was then dismissed by Pearson, triggering an Australian collapsed to 134 all out, losing their last seven wickets for 44 runs. She then took 0/21 and ran out Kathryn Leng with a throw to Price as the tourists took a 53-run lead. However, Australia's top-order again capitulated, and Sthalekar came to the crease at 3/36; the score then became 4/49 when Jones fell. Sthalekar then combined with Alex Blackwell to take Australia out of trouble, putting on 136 for the fifth wicket before the latter fell for 58. Sthalekar ended with an unbeaten 120, including four fours, from six hours of batting, as Australia declared at 7/259. Sthalekar then took 1/26 from 18 overs, removing Leng lbw, as England ended the match at 6/133 to avoid a defeat.
After a personally and collectively disappointing WNCL in 2002–03, Sthalekar and New South Wales started the new season strongly in the double-header against Western Australia. Sthalekar hit 59 and then took 3/34 in a convincing 82-run win in the opening match. The next day, she brought up her maiden one-day hundred, scoring 108 of 8/284 before taking 2/28 in a heavy 145-run win. However a form slump followed as Sthalekar scored only 39 runs and took one wicket in the next four matches; this included a three-match run included a loss to South Australia and a tie and loss against Victoria. She returned to form in the final double-header against Queensland, contributing 29 and 2/14, and 46 and 2/16, bowling ten overs in both matches as New South Wales won both fixtures by five wickets to qualify second for the finals hosted by the reigning champions Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the first match, Sthalekar scored 5 and took 2/19 from her 10 overs but it was not enough as the hosts reached their target of 129 with six wickets in hand. She took a wicket in each of the remaining matches, which New South Wales won by five and seven wickets respectively to regain the WNCL title, but she contributed little with the bat, scoring 24 and 3. She ended the season with 256 runs at 28.45 and 14 wickets at 17.92 with an economy rate of 2.58 from 11 matches.
Sthalekar was consistent with the ball for the Rose Bowl series, which consisted of three matches each in New Zealand and then Australia. She played in all six matches and took two wickets in three of them, and one wicket in each of the remaining fixtures, ending with nine wickets at 18.44 and an economy rate of 2.91. She was less successful with the bat, scoring 67 runs at 13.40 with a best of 35 as Australia won the series 5–1.
Sthalekar was in good form with the bat at the start of the 2004–05 WNCL. She scored an unbeaten 96 in the second match of the season against Western Australia and in the first four matches had scored 154 runs, being dismissed only twice, one of these times by a run out. She took four wickets in these matches and the season was adjourned for a seven-match ODI tour of her native country India, where the Australians were met by dry spin-friendly surfaces. Sthalekar was prominent with both bat and ball as Australia took the first two matches in Mysore. She had match figures of 34 and 2/31, and 30 and 2/36, bowling ten overs in both matches. The tourists travelled to Mumbai in Sthalekar's home state of Maharashtra, but it was not a successful visit on the field; she was run out for 2 and her 1/19 was not enough to prevent a six-wicket defeat. Australia won the next two matches to seal the series, before the hosts won the remaining dead rubbers. Sthalekar scored 152 runs at 25.33 and took eight wickets at 24.12 and an economy rate of 3.38. Her best score of the series was 43 in the sixth match.
The Australians returned home and the WNCL resumed. Sthalekar took 4/32 against Victoria and 3/33 against Queensland setting up three-wicket wins in both cases. New South Wales met Victoria in the finals and Sthalekar was not successful in the three matches, scoring 16, 4 and 5 taking only two wickets in total as the defending champions lost their title 2–1. In the second phases of the WNCL, Sthalekar did not pass 25 and totalled 86 runs in seven matches. She ended the season with 250 runs at 27.77 and 14 wickets at 21.64 at an economy rate of 3.06.
2005 World Cup victory.
Before the Australians headed to South Africa for the 2005 World Cup, they had a three-match Rose Bowl series against New Zealand in Perth. Sthalekar played in the first and third matches, both won by Australia, but did not play a prominent part in the victories, scoring 12 runs at 6.00 and taking one wicket at 29.00 from 11 overs.
After arriving in South Africa, Sthalekar played in each match of Australia's dominant unbeaten campaign. Each team played the other seven countries once in a round-robin phase before the top four went through to the semi-finals. In the first match, Sthalekar took 1/26 from ten overs as England made 7/169 before rain ended the match. This was followed by an encounter with New Zealand. Sthalekar scored 13 in Australia's 7/174 and bowled four overs without success, conceding 23 runs in a 32-run win.
In the third match against the West Indies, she made 17 and took 2/16 from four overs in a 79-run win. This was followed by a 97-run win over the hosts, in which Sthalekar made an unbeaten 22 late in the innings and took 1/26 from seven overs. The group stages ended with two easy victories. Sthalekar took 1/11 from six overs as the opening pacemen did much of the damage in dismissing Sri Lanka for 57. She was then unbeaten on one as Australia reached their target with eight wickets in hand. The match against Ireland was similar. Sthalekar took 1/15 from six overs, and then was allowed to open the batting. She made 28 not out as Australia achieved the target of 67 with all wickets intact. The final pool match against India was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to inclement weather, and Australia met England in the semi-finals. Sthalekar took 1/21 from five overs and then scored 29 before being run out en route to a five-wicket win. In the final against India, she scored 55 as Australia amassed 4/215. She then took 1/18 from four overs and a catch as Australia bowled India out for 117 to win by 98 runs. Sthalekar ended the tournament with 165 runs at 41.25 and 7 wickets at 22.28 and an economy rate of 3.39.
In the northern hemisphere summer of 2005, Australia toured England. They started with a stopover in Ireland, and only the second of the three ODIs went ahead; the other two matches were washed out by persistent rain. Sthalekar cracked 100 not out, her maiden ODI century, as Australia made 3/295 and took a 240-run win. Australia played two Tests in England. In the First Test at County Ground in Hove, Sussex, Sthalekar batted at No. 4 and made three as Australia collapsed to be 7/115 before recovering to end with 355. Sthalekar then took 3/70 as Australia dismissed the hosts for 273 and took an 82-run lead. She bowled Claire Taylor for 41 before returning late in the innings to remove middle-order batsmen Arran Brindle and Rosalie Birch as England lost their last six wickets for 39 runs.
After both Australian openers fell for ducks, Sthalekar joined Karen Rolton at the crease with the score on 2/7 in the second innings. She made 40 from 122 balls and put on a stand of 115 with Rolton before being removed by Katherine Brunt, starting a steady flow of wickets as Australia were all out for 223 to leave the hosts a target of 306. Sthalekar took 3/44 from 30 overs, including 16 maidens, removing captain Connor, Jenny Gunn and Beth Morgan as the hosts hung on for a draw with three wickets in hand. In the Second Test at New Road, Worcester, Sthalekar made 34 and took 1/29, removing Brunt as the hosts made 289 and took a 158-run lead. In the second innings, she fell for a duck in Australia's 232, which left England a target of 75. Sthalekar took 0/4 as the hosts reached the target with six wickets in hand. She ended the Tests with 77 runs at 19.25 and seven wickets at 21.00.
Australia and Sthalekar had more success in the five ODIs. The tourists won the first two matches but the hosts fought back to win the next two. In the deciding match, Sthalekar took 2/54 from her 10 overs and scored 53 as Australia chased down England's 256 with four wickets in hand to seal the series 3–2. Sthalekar had a strong run with the bat, scoring two other scores of 40 or more to end with 140 runs at 28.00. She took six wickets at 25.00 at an economy rate of 4.28.
Sthalekar then played in Australia's inaugural Twenty20 international at the County Ground, Taunton, and only the second international match in the history of the new format. She was not successful; the English batsmen attacked her and she ended with 1/37 from four overs. Australia chased down the target of 152 with seven wickets in hand, but Sthalekar did not contribute with the bat, being dismissed for a duck.
Ten-wicket Test haul and Belinda Clark Awards.
Sthalekar had another consistent season in the 2005–06 WNCL, taking 14 wickets at 20.92 and an economy rate of 2.81 and scored 264 runs at 33.00 in 11 matches. Her best bowling figures were a 3/15 in the first match against Queensland and she took at least two wickets in each double-header. New South Wales seven of their eight matches to qualify for the final, where they met Queensland. Sthalekar took 0/27 from her ten overs as Queensland were dismissed for 174 and she was unbeaten without scoring when New South Wales reached the target with eight wickets in hand. The next day, she made 53 as New South Wales capitulated to be all out for 154. She took 1/24 from her ten overs, but it was not enough to prevent a three-wicket defeat. In the deciding match, Sthalekar made 39 of 146 all out and took 2/20 from ten overs as New South Wales hung on by two runs to take the WNCL title.
The Australian season ended with a home series against India in Adelaide. In the one-off Test, the hosts batted first and Sthalekar came in at 2/54 to join captain Karen Rolton. The pair put on 56 runs, the largest partnership of the match, before Rolton was out at 3/110, followed by Kate Blackwell without further addition to the score. Wickets continued to fall regularly until Sthalekar put on 44 with debutant wicket-keeper Jodie Purves before falling herself at 8/213. She ended with the top-score of 72 from 180 balls in Australia's 250. Sthalekar was wicketless as the hosts bowled out the Indians for 93 to take a 157-run first innings lead and enforce the follow on. She then took 5/30 from 20.5 overs to help dismiss the tourists for 153 and seal victory by an innings and four runs. She dismissed captain and leading batsman Mithali Raj before bowling Anjum Chopra to leave the visitors at 3/48. She later returned to take three late wickets, dismissing Sunetra Paranjpe, Jhulan Goswami and Nooshin Al Khadeer as the Indians lost their last five wickets for 25 runs. Sthalekar was named the player of the match for her efforts. Sthalekar played in all three matches as Australia swept the ODIs. She scored 31 runs at 31.00 and took three wickets at 19.33 and an economy rate of 2.93.
The following 2006–07 season started with the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand, which the Australians hosted at Allan Border Field in Brisbane. The five ODIs were preceded by a T20 match, in which Sthalekar took 1/26 from her four overs and scored seven in a tied match. She was consistently productive, making 51, 53, 46, 43 and 17 as Australia took a clean sweep of the ODIs, albeit with one-wicket victories in the first two matches. Two of Sthalekar's dismissals came in run outs, and she ended with 210 runs at 42.00. Her bowling was not so effective, yielding three wickets at 46.66 at an economy rate of 3.50.
Sthalekar had another consistent season in the 2006–07 WNCL. Apart from one wicketless game, she took one or two wickets in each of the seven remaining round-robin matches. New South Wales struggled early in the season, narrowly winning the first match by three wickets against Victoria before losing three matches in a row against the same team and Queensland. Sthalekar failed to capitalise on her starts in these matches, making 40, 27, 31 and 0 as her team averaged 177 in the three losses. New South Wales fought back to win their four remaining matches to qualify for the finals; in the last qualifying match, Sthalekar made 92 not out to guide her team to an eight-wicket win and seal their berth in the deciding matches against Victoria. In the first final, Sthalekar took 1/22 and made nine as New South Wales reached their target of 137 with only one wicket in hand. She then scored three and went wicketless as Victoria squared the series with an eight-wicket the next day. In the deciding final, Sthalekar was attacked by the Victorians, conceding 34 runs from seven overs. In the run-chase, she top-scored with 83 as the defending champions prevailed by three wickets to win consecutive titles. Sthalekar ended the series with 11 wickets at 27.36 at an economy rate of 2.95 and 325 runs at 36.11.
After the end of the Australian season, Sthalekar was selected for the ODI team for a four-nations tournament in Chennai, India. In addition to the hosts and Australia, New Zealand and England were also participating, and each team played each other twice in round-robin phase. In the first match, Sthalekar made 65 as Australia amassed 9/260 but her bowling was attacked by New Zealand, who took 41 runs without loss from her four overs en route to a six-wicket win. Sthalekar made an unbeaten 87 as Australia reached 8/213 against the hosts. She was unable to penetrate the Indian batsmen, taking 0/21 from five overs as they reached the target with three wickets in hand. The next match against England was similar for Sthalekar. She took 1/29 from her five overs as England made 7/216, and then made 85 not out in Australia's six-wicket win, guiding them to the target. Sthalekar scored 45 and took 1/31 in a 49-run win over New Zealand, and the second match against England resembled the first. Sthalekar took 1/44 from her ten overs and then scored 77 to help set up a six-wicket win in pursuit of 269. She continued to be uneconomical in the final round-robin match against India, conceding 64 runs from her 10 overs, but also took three wickets. Sthalekar managed only three but Australia nevertheless won by six wickets to reach the final against New Zealand. There she took 1/32 from eight overs, before scoring an unbeaten 32 and being at the crease when Australia completed a six-wicket win to take the competition.
Sthalekar ended the series with 394 runs at 98.50, her best batting performance in an international series. In contrast, her bowling was neither penetrative nor economical; she took seven wickets at 37.28 at an economy rate of 5.22. For the whole 2006–07 international season, she had scored 604 runs at 67.11 and taken ten wickets at 40.10.
This trend continued in the Rose Bowl series held in tropical Darwin in July 2007, the middle of the southern hemisphere winter. Sthalekar played in the first three of the five matches, scoring 69 runs at 69.00 and taking one wicket at 74.00 at an economy rate of 4.11. In the T20 match that preceded the series, she took 2/15 from her four overs and was out for three as Australia scraped home by one wicket.
After conceding runs at a high rate in international matches in the past year, Sthalekar started the 2007–08 WNCL season in highly economical fashion. In the first match against South Australia, she bowled four maidens and ended with 2/7 from ten overs, helping to restrict New South Wales' target to 166. She then made 56 to lead her team to a seven-wicket win. The next day she took two catches and bowled six maidens in her 2/9 from ten overs in a 25-run win. In the following double-header she was prominent in consecutive defeats of Victoria. After taking 1/29, she scored an unbeaten 93 to steer New South Wales to a seven-wicket win, and then scored 70 and took 2/50 the next day to help seal a 25-run win. She then took 3/20 in the fifth match against Queensland to help ensure a 66-run win. New South Wales went to win all of their reound-robin matches except the final fixture against Western Australia. They qualified first for the final against South Australia and were awarded the final went rain force the match to be cancelled. Sthalekar ended with 312 runs at 44.57 and 12 wickets at 14.58 at an economy rate of 2.73.
The domestic competition was followed by two international series against England and New Zealand. Sthalekar made 17 and took 0/19 from three overs as Australia won the T20 international against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the ODIs that followed, drawn 2–2, Sthalekar scored 95 runs at 23.75 and took four wickets at 32.00 at an economy rate of 3.85. Her best performance came in the second match at the MCG, scoring 45 before taking 2/40 in an 84-run win. In the one-off Test at Bowral, Sthalekar scored two in the first innings as Australia made 154 batting first. She then took 3/48 from 28 overs as England ended on 244 all out with a 90-run lead. The tourists had been in a much stronger position at 3/216 before Sthalekar took three wickets in three consecutive overs to trigger the loss of the last seven wickets for 28 runs. She had Claire Taylor caught behind by Leonie Coleman for 79, before bowling wicket-keeper Sarah Taylor in her next over for 19. In the following over, a maiden, she bowled Nicki Shaw for a duck. She was the mainstay of the hosts' second innings of 9/231 declared, making 98. Sthalekar had come to the crease with the score at 2/33, before Karen Rolton was out two balls later to leave the score at 3/34. She and Nitschke then rebuilt the innings, putting on 107 runs in 159 minutes before Nitschke was out for 36. Sthalekar then added a further 57 runs from 21.1 overs with Kate Blackwell before she was dismissed two runs short of her century by Beth Morgan, having batted for 204 balls and almost four hours, hitting 14 fours. Australia then lost wickets steadily to leave England with a target of 142. Sthalekar was relatively expensive, taking 1/49 from 13 overs in the second innings and dismissing Morgan as the tourists reached their target with six wickets in hand.
The Australians then headed to Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Lincoln, New Zealand, for a T20 international and five ODIs. Sthalekar made 13 and took 1/12 from three overs as the hosts won the T20 by four wickets. She then made 19 of 5/189 in the first ODI and took 2/25 to help secure a 63-run win. In the next two matches, she made single-figure scores and took one wicket, as the hosts claimed both matches to take the series lead. Australia thus needed to win the remaining two matches. In the fourth match, Sthalekar made 69 and took 2/39 in an Australian win?? In the final match, she was attacked by the local batsmen and conceded 58 runs from 10 wicketless overs. She then made 61 not out to help steer Australia to their target of 250 and a series-clinching eight-wicket win. Sthalekar ended the series with 155 runs at 38.75 and six wickets at 33.00 at an economy rate of 4.38.
The 2008–09 Australian season started with a tour by India. At the start of the season, the International Cricket Council introduced player rankings system for women; Sthalekar occupied the No. 1 all-rounder position ahead of Australian teammate Shelley Nitschke.
Sthalekar started with 1/21 from four overs and 23 in a six-wicket win the T20 match. She was prominent as the hosts completed a 5–0 clean sweep of the ODIs. In the first match at Hurstville Oval, she made 73 not out in an eight-wicket win, before setting up the next match at the SCG with an unbeaten 104. She then took 1/15 in an 86-run win. She then helped Australia gain an unassailable lead in the third match, taking 4/20 from ten overs to help seal a 54-run win, having made 11 not out at the death in Australia's innings. Sthalekar took one wicket in each of the last two matches and ended with seven wickets at 17.71 and an economy rate of 3.01. With the bat, she made 208 runs at 104.00.
When the WNCL started, Sthalekar did not have a heavy workload with the bat. New South Wales won seven of their eight round-robin matches, five of these by seven or more wickets in run-chases. As a result of the effectiveness of the first three batsmen in the order, Sthalekar only had to bat six times in these eight matches, and was twice unbeaten on single-figure scores when the target was reached. Her top-score of 57 not out came in the final match when she guided New South Wales to a three-wicket win over Victoria. By the end of the round-robin phase, she had scored 175 runs and been dismissed only once, in the only match in which her state did not bat last. With the ball, Sthalekar took two wickets in three of the first four matches for a total of seven wickets in those matches, but only took two in the last four matches. In the final, she took 0/29 from seven overs as New South Wales dismissed Victoria for 117. She then made 16 in a six-wicket win. Sthalekar ended the competition with 191 runs at 95.50 and ten wickets at 22.70 at an economy rate of 2.80.
After the WNCL ended, the Australians headed to New Zealand for the Rose Bowl series. In the second match, Sthalekar made 72 and took 2/40 from her ten overs, but it was not enough to prevent a four-run/three-wicket defeat. This left Australia 2–0 down and she took 3/16 and 2/58 in the next two matches to square the series 2–2. The last match was washed out and Sthalekar ended with 79 runs at 26.33 and seven wickets at 19.28 at an economy rate of 4.15. The teams returned to Australia for the one-off T20 match, and Sthalekar took 2/28 from three overs and then scored 23 not out as Australia won under the Duckworth Lewis method. In two warm-up matches against England and Sri Lanka ahead of the World Cup, Sthalekar made 12 and 19 and totalled 0/23 from nine overs.
2009 World Cup and World Twenty20.
In the opening match of the World Cup campaign, Sthalekar took 2/35 from her ten overs as New Zealand made 205 all out. She then made six as Australia fell short of their target on the Duckworth-Lewis method. Australia then needed to win their two remaining group matches to reach the Super Six phase. Sthalekar made 19 and took 1/27 from ten overs as Australia defeated South Africa by 61 runs. She then scored 15 and took 2/32 from nine overs in a 47-run win over the West Indies. In the first Super Six match, the Indians attacked Sthalekar's bowling although she took three wickets, ending on 3/52 from ten overs. she then made a duck as Australia made 7/218, falling 17 runs of their target. She then missed the win over Pakistan by 107 runs. She returned for Australia's final Super Six match against England, and although the hosts won, it was not enough for them to place in the top two in the standings and qualify for the final. Sthalekar took 2/31 from ten overs and Australia reached the target of 162 with eight wickets in hand and she was not required to bat. In the third-place playoff against India, she made 30 of Australia's 142 after an early collapse, and then took 3/27 from her ten overs, but was not able to prevent a three-wicket defeat. Sthalekar ended the tournament with 70 runs at 14.00 and took 13 wickets at 15.69 at an economy rate of 3.45.
Sthalekar was selected for Australia's team for the inaugural Women's World Twenty20 held in England in 2009. The Australians hosted New Zealand for a three-match series in tropical Darwin at the beginning of June before the World Cup, and Sthalekar played in all the matches with much success, taking 3/12, 3/11 and 2/25 from four overs in each match, equating to an average of 6.00 and an economy rate of 4.00. She added 34 in the third match to help secure a 32-run win and a 2–1 series result. Arriving in the northern hemisphere she took 3/14 from three overs in the team's only warm-up on English soil, a five-run win against the hosts.
However, Sthalekar was not successful in the tournament with the ball. After making 46 in Australia's 8/123, she conceded 18 runs from 20 balls to the New Zealand batsmen in a nine-wicket defeat. She then took 2/23 in four overs against the West Indies before sealing an eight-wicket win with an unbeaten 34. Sthalekar then made one and took 0/13 from four overs as Australia defeated South Africa by 24 runs. This put Australia into the semi-final against England. Sthalekar made 28 but was then attacked by the local batsmen, conceding 23 runs from two overs as England overhauled Australia's score of 5/163 to reach the final, which they won. Sthalekar ended the tournament with 109 runs at 36.33 and two wickets at 38.50 at an economy rate of 5.77.
Sthalekar and the Australians stayed in England for a bilateral series against the hosts, who were the reigning world champions in both ODIs and T20s, after the end of the World Twenty20. She played in all five ODIs, with consistent although unspectacular results. She took a wicket in all but one match and made three scores between 20 and 45. She ended with four wickets at 30.00 at an economy rate of 3.61, and scored 109 runs at 21.80. Her best performance was in the third match at Stratford-upon-Avon, scoring 16 not out before taking 2/31 from six overs in a two-wicket defeat. She ended the series with 34 runs at 17.00.
England won all the ODI matches except the last, which was washed out. Sthalekar played in the one-off Test match at County Road in Worcestershire. She scored six as Australia collapsed to 5/28 before recovering to 309, before taking 1/41 from 26 overs, bowling top-scorer Morgan for 58 to help Australia take a 41-run lead. She was then run out for seven as Australia set the hosts a target of 273 before the match was drawn. She took 1/19 from 13 overs in the second innings, dismissing Claire Taylor as England reached 3/106 to draw the match.
Sthalekar started the 2009–10 WNCL season slowly, going wicketless in two matches against Queensland. She then took three wickets in the two matches against the Australian Capital Territory, scoring 48 and taking 2/27 from ten overs in an upset four-wicket defeat to the new team in their debut season. She made 42 in the next match against Victoria, a five-wicket win, before taking 3/26 and making 27 in a 67-run defeat the next day. Sthalekar then peaked during the double-header against Western Australia. In the first match, she made 108 not out as New South Wales amassed 3/303 and took 1/11 as they completed a 127-run win. The next day, she took 4/14 from her ten overs, helping to dismiss Western Australia for 99 and set up a ten-wicket win. New South Wales won eight of their ten round-robin matches and proceeded to the final against Victoria, Sthalekar scored 49 as the defending champions made 9/206. She then bowled only three overs, taking 0/15 as her state completed another WNCL title with a 59-run win, bowling out the Victorians for 147. Sthalekar ended the season with 348 runs at 49.71 and 13 wickets at 18.15 at an economy rate of 3.18.
During the 2009–10 season, there was a full T20 domestic tournament was introduced. In seven matches, Sthalekar scored 33 runs at 8.25 with a best of 20 against the Australian Capital Territory, and took six wickets at 22.33 at an economy rate of 4.78. New South Wales won five of their six matches and met Victoria—the only team to beat them in the round-robin phase—in the final. Sthalekar took 1/25 from four overs and was out for nine as New South Wales were dismissed for 75 and suffered a 52-run defeat.
After the series, Sthalekar played in the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand, starting with five ODIs in Australia. In the first two matches, held at the Adelaide Oval, she took 3/25 and 2/21 from eight and seven overs respectively as the hosts won both matches. The last three matches of the series were held at the Junction Oval. In the third ODI, Sthalekar took 2/19 from eight overs as Australia took a 102-run win and sealed the series. She went wicketless in the fourth match and was rested from the final game. Australia took a 5–0 whitewash. Sthalekar scored 11 runs at 3.66 and took seven wickets at 15.85 and an economy rate of 3.36.
The ODIs were followed by three T20s at Bellerive Oval in Hobart and two more in New Zealand at the start of the second phase of the bilateral contests. Sthalekar played in every match and Australia was whitewashed, although her bowling remained economical. She took five wickets at 20.60 and an economy rate of 5.46. Apart from conceding 34 from three overs in the first match, her economy rate never exceeded 5.22 in the remaining matches. Sthalekar carried over her unproductive batting into the T20s, ending with 23 runs at 5.75.
Australia then swept New Zealand 3–0 in the ODIs in New Zealand. In the first match, Sthalekar went wicketless and made a duck but Australia able to scrape home by two wickets.

Sthalekar ended the series with 40 runs at 40.00 and took five wickets at 24.00 with an economy rate of 4.80.
2010 World Twenty20 triumph.
Sthalekar was part of the 2010 World Twenty20 winning team in the West Indies and played in all but one warm-up match. After being rested from the first warm-up match against New Zealand, which Australia lost by 18 runs, Sthalekar played in the last warm-up match against Pakistan. She did not bat as Australia made 5/166 and took 2/19 from three overs as Australian won by 82 runs.
Australia were grouped with defending champions England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Sthalekar dismissed top-scorer Sarah Taylor in the 12th overs, before removing Jenny Gunn and Danielle Hazell in the 14th and 16th overs. This sparked a collapse as England lost their last seven wickets for 29 runs, including their last four without further addition to the total, as England were dismissed with 15 balls unused. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia had lost momentum and lost 3/3 in 16 balls before Sthalekar, who had come in at No. 8, was joined at the crease by Alyssa Healy with the score on 7/63 and 42 runs needed from 34 balls. The pair put on 23 from 13 balls to help regain the initiative before Healy was out. Sthalekar was then out for 10 from 11 balls, leaving Australia at 9/97, with eight runs required from the last seven balls. Australia seven runs from the next four balls before Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.
A Super Over eventuated, and both teams ended with 2/6 after both suffered run outs in an attempt to secure a seventh run on the final ball. Australia was awarded the match because they had hit more sixes in the match—Jess Cameron scored the solitary six. Sthalekar was named the player of the match.
In the next match against South Africa, Sthalekar batted at No. 10 and came in late in the innings as Australia collapsed in the final overs and lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused. Sthalekar faced one ball and was run out for a duck. She then took 1/23 from her four overs, taking one catch and dismissing Dane van Niekerk from the last ball of the match as Australia completed a 22-run win.
In the final group match against the hosts, Sthalekar came in at 5/86 in the 14th over and batted until the end of the innings, finishing unbeaten on 23 from 23 balls as Australia finished on 7/133. She took 1/20 from her four overs, dismissing Shanel Daley as Australia won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten at the top of their quartet.
Australia went on to face India in the semi-final. Sthalekar took 1/25 from her four overs, dismissing leading Indian batsman Mithali Raj. She was not required to bat as the Australians reached their target of 120 with seven wickets and seven balls to spare.
Australia batted first and Sthalekar came in with the score at 6/72 in the 16th over to join Sarah Elliott. The pair put on 27 from 22 balls. Sthalekar scored 18 from 13 balls, including two boundaries, before being bowled by Sophie Devine after moving across outside off stump and trying to paddle scoop the ball down to fine leg in the 19th over. Sthalekar was the only Australian to score at faster than a run a ball as the team ended with 8/106.
New Zealand fell to be 4/29 in the eighth over, and during the subsequent period, Nitschke and Sthalekar tied them down with spin as they tried to consolidate. Sthalekar did not take a wicket but conceded only 19 runs from her four overs. Devine required five runs from the last ball to win and she struck a powerful straight drive from the bowling of Ellyse Perry, who stuck out her right foot. The ball deflected to mid-on where Sthalekar stopped it and restricted the scoring to a single, sealing an Australian win by three runs.
Personal life.
Sthalekar's nickname is "Shaker", "... because there have been so many mispronunciations of my name the girls were one day mucking around and stumbled on this one...it has just stuck ever since."

Hoover High School (San Diego, California)

Herbert Hoover High School is a comprehensive, public secondary school in the City Heights neighborhood of San Diego, California, United States. It is part of San Diego Unified School District. It is one of the oldest schools in San Diego.
History.
The school was established in 1930 and named in honor of then U.S. President Herbert Hoover. The first principal was Floyd Johnson. It originally opened as a beige stucco building with a red-tile roof and unreinforced concrete, giving it a Spanish-style appearance. As part of a tradition related to signing their yearbooks, 12th grade (senior) students climbed a tower that became a signature defining aspect of the campus.
In 1954 "California Concerts" (also referred to as Jazz Goes to High School) was a live album by saxophonist and bandleader Gerry Mulligan featuring performances recorded at Stockton High School and Hoover High.
The school underwent renovations in the early 1970s. The tower and other architectural features were erased by the renovation.
As of 2004, Douglas Fisher, Nancy Frey, and Douglas Williams, the authors of "Five Years Later", stated that before 1998, Hoover had been known as the "ghetto school" of San Diego USD, and that schools with higher academic performances poached the best students from Hoover. Adam Berman, who previously taught at Hoover, wrote that in 1988 Hoover had low teacher morale, acts of violence, and a high dropout rate in addition to poor academic performance.
The school joined the City Heights Educational Initiative, along with two other high schools and San Diego State University, in 1998 as part of an effort to improve. In 2000 the school met its California state accountability target. This was the first time it had done so in 15 years. Circa 2000 Berman, by then a California Department of Education employee, wrote an independent review of the changes made at Hoover. The review, titled "A focus on literacy: Hoover High School in San Diego," was published in the "California High School Newsletter".
Around 2015 the school was scheduled to receive a renovation of the administrative area and main entrance, and parents and community members lobbied for a restoration of the tower and other historic architectural features as part of this renovation. Burt Nestor, a member of the Hoover class of 1946, gave the school a chunk of an ornamental archway from the original building. His son gave it to him as a gift around 1973, as the renovation had destroyed portions of the original campus. The piece is to be either used in the 2015 renovation, or displayed separately.
In 2015 Michael Shefcik, the supervisor of plant operations at Hoover, discovered that a sculpture in the library was actually a 1940 Works Progress Administration (WPA) statue, titled "Girl Reading" and created by Donal Hord, depicting a girl reading a book.
Student body.
As of 2016 the school had over 2,100 students. The school consists of 73% Hispanic, 10% African American, 10% Indochinese, with Asian at 1.8% and white at 1%. Hoover is a Title 1 school. That status is determined by the number of students who receive free or reduced lunch. 90% of Hoover students qualify for meal eligibility.
The City Heights neighborhood, in the school's attendance area, houses many immigrant families and low income families.
Programs.
As of 2015 Hoover High is establishing a wellness center which will offer counseling services as well as some medical services.
Student discipline.
In 2013 the school enacted a program in which teachers learn to recognize signs of trauma in students. Suspensions from school were reduced by 80%.
Academic performance.
In 1999 the school had a 444/1000 Academic Performance Index (API), the lowest score in San Diego County. It had a statewide rank of the lowest 10% (first decile), and the lowest 20% of schools with similar demographics. The Gates-MacGinitie reading assessments at this school resulted in a 5.9 grade level equivalent for the average student. At that time the school was among the twenty high schools in California with the worst academic performance.
In 2002 it had an API of 506, an increase by 62 points. By 2000 the reading achievement scores had risen by an average of 2.4 years.
Athletics.
By the 2010s Hoover High received renovations that improved its football stadium. Artie Ojeda of NBC San Diego stated that it then had "one of the nicer high school stadium facilities in San Diego".
In 2012 the school began holding football games at night. Some residents of Talmadge were unhappy with this, so a legal battle between the school and residents was begun, and night football games stopped in September 2013. In 2014 a judge ruled that the night football games could continue.

Sanyaa

Sanya Khuna is a traditional Newari dish from Nepal, made using dried fish. It is a unique type of curry, notable for its gelatinous texture after preparation. This dish is a hallmark of Newar cuisine, particularly originating from the Newar community of the Kathmandu Valley (also known as Nepal Valley). 
The preparation begins by soaking dried fish in cold water to rehydrate it. The fish is then cooked with mustard oil, spices, and water in the traditional Newari style. Once the cooking process is complete, the soup-based curry is poured into small bowls and left to cool. It is then stored in a cold place or refrigerated for at least 12 hours. During this time, the soup sets into a jelly-like consistency, which is characteristic of Sanya Khuna.
This dish holds cultural significance and is highly popular within Newar communities, often served during festivals and special occasions.

Mevo Modi'im

Mevo Modi'im (, "lit." Modi'im Gateway), officially Me'or Modi'im (), is a moshav in central Israel. It is also known as the Carlebach Moshav. Located north-west of Modi'in on Highway 443, it falls under the jurisdiction of Hevel Modi'in Regional Council. In it had a population of . In 2019, a fire destroyed most of Mevo Modi'im and it is currently in the process of reconstruction and expansion.
Establishment.
The village was founded as a moshav shitufi in 1975 by Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, who acquired it from Poalei Agudat Yisrael where he had family connections. Rabbi Carlebach lived there in the later years of his life. Some of the residents came to the village as a group from Jerusalem, following the direction of Carlebach. Many came from or through the former "The House of Love and Prayer" which was first established in San Francisco, and later in Jerusalem.
Description.
At its center, the village has a hand-painted and ornately decorated main synagogue, painted by Yitzchak Ben Yehudah.
On an uninhabited hill at the moshav center there are remains of an ancient settlement. The remains of a monastery from the Byzantine period were found as well as a mosaic floor that has been preserved almost in its entirety. Next to the remains moshav residents built a new pavilion in memory of Esh Kodesh Gilmore who was killed in a terrorist attack on 30 October 2000.
Fire and rebuilding.
On May 23, 2019 a large fire destroyed most of Mevo Modi'im - forty out of fifty homes. A Fire Services investigation concluded it was started in multiple locations, raising suspicion of arson. A year after the fire most of the residents were still homeless. In 2020 the residents made a land settlement with authorities. Public contracts for the construction of 112 residential units were engaged in 2021.

Jeffboat

Jeffboat was a shipyard in Jeffersonville, Indiana founded by James Howard in 1834, a builder of steamboats. The company was owned by the Howard family until it was sold leading up to World War II. Following the war, it became known as the Jeffersonville Boat and Machine Company and later changed its name to Jeffboat, the more commonly used short form of its name. The company was the largest inland shipbuilder in the United States and the second-largest builder of barges before it closed in 2018.
Origin.
Jeffboat was originally established as the Howard Shipyards in 1834 by James Howard when he started his first boat, the "Hyperion". The Howard family controlled the company for 107 years, building over 3,000 ships.
19th-century steamboats.
The "Joe Fowler" is a former steamboat built at the Howard Shipyard in 1888. The sternwheeler was designed for packet service between Evansville, Indiana and Paducah, Kentucky. "Joe Fowler" was a United States Mail carrier, and after seven years of service, had logged over 327,000 miles and transported over 152,000 passengers without a fatal accident. In 1914, new owners replaced the steamer with high-pressure boilers designed for the western rivers. After this time, "Joe Fowler" ran excursions around the Pittsburgh and Wheeling, West Virginia areas, before hosting a cruise down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers for Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and a long summer cruise from Pittsburgh to St. Paul, then back to Louisville. After 1917, it was sold, refitted to better serve excursions, and renamed "Crescent".
The "Emily" is a former sternwheeled steamboat built at the Howard Shipyard in 1891. The single-boiler steamer began in ferry service at Kenova, West Virginia, and later operated at Wheeling, West Virginia. "Emily" was sold three times, starting in 1902. The third buyer was Henderson Ferry Company of Henderson, Kentucky, which renamed it the "Dixie Bee Line". It burned in Henderson in 1926. After a rebuild, it ran as the ferry "Ohio No. 2". In the 1930s, it was renovated for packet service, and renamed "Joe Curtis", and plied the waters near Memphis until it struck ice and sunk on January 25, 1940.
20th century.
Besides the original Jeffersonville, In. location the company had also established Yards in Paducah, Kentucky, Madison, Indiana, Cincinnati, and other locations. Most of them were put up for sale in 1917.
The company faced persistent challenges during the Great Depression. The United States Navy bought the shipyards in 1942 and reorganized it as the Jeffersonville Boat &amp; Machine Company.
During World War II, it built 123 vessels of the type known as "Landing Ship, Tank" (LSTs), 23 submarine chasers, and numerous other craft. Post-war, the shipyards built customized crafts, but specialized in barges and towboats. In 1957, the official name was changed to Jeffboat.
The Jeffboat yard built two nostalgic paddlewheelers during this period. In 1973, it completed "Mississippi Queen" steamboat", and in 1985, finished the General Jackson" showboat.
Production was stopped from 1986 to 1989.
21st century.
A wildcat strike shut down operations during part of 2001.
The Jeffboat yard built a third nostalgic paddlewheeler, the "City of Evansville", which was put into service as the "Casino Aztar" riverboat casino.
A union decertification petition was circulated in 2016, but employees voted 649 to 190 to retain Teamsters Local 89 as their union.
As of 20 June 2015, the 68-acre Jeffboat shipyard is owned by American Commercial Lines Inc. (ACL), a company also based in Jeffersonville, Indiana. Mark Knoy is the CEO. In turn, Platinum Equity owns ACL, the largest inland shipbuilder in the United States, building both river barges and ocean barges.
The company laid off 278 employees in November 2017 due to a lack of production, and it closed permanently on April 23, 2018.

Fender HM Strat

The Fender HM Strat was an electric guitar produced by Fender Musical Instruments from 1988 until 1992. A relatively radical departure from Leo Fender's classic Stratocaster design, it was Fender's answer to Superstrats produced by manufacturers such as Jackson Guitars and Ibanez. The "HM" in the guitars name stands for heavy metal.
Specifications.
The Fender HM strat was originally produced in Japan. Some sources say production started as early as 1984. Subsequently, in 1989, it was produced in the United States. Some evidence indicates that assembly in the U.S. with components imported from Japan may have begun as early as 1987.
First Version - 
The first version appeared with a distinct "Strat" logo in the headstock, 24 thicker and wider "medium jumbo" frets, a maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard and with one of the four neck "bolts" (screws) off-set at the bottom of the neck to allow a more comfortable "heel" area for playing in the upper registers, a lighter basswood body, or occasionally alder for US made guitars). The scale length is an even , rather than the normal commonly used on Stratocaster and Telecaster guitars. Pickup configurations included one DiMarzio humbucker "Super 3" pickup in the bridge position ("H" configuration), two humbucker pickups at the bridge and neck positions (HH configuration), or one humbucker at the bridge and two single coil pickups at the middle and neck positions (HSS configuration). In addition, the Fender HM Strat had a licensed double-locking Kahler Spyder tremolo system, Gotoh tuners, and a side-mounted jack socket.
Japanese-assembled guitars have colored polyester on the bodies, and clear polyester on the necks. American-assembled HM Strats have a very hard aircraft grade urethane color and clear coats on the body, while still using a polyester finish on the neck.
Second Version - 
The US HM series stratocasters were produced in 1990 (possibly late 1988 with Japanese sourced components) and included the Strat 10-3200 (i.e. cont. strat, HSS), 10-2100 (HSS), 10-2102 (HSS), 10-2200 (1 silver sensor, H), 10-2300 (HH) and 10-2400 (H) models. All HM strat US made models had a scale length of and a fingerboard radius of . 
HM Strat Ultra - 
Later on (in around 1990), Fender introduced the USA HM Strat Ultra that is considered by many to be superior to the previous HM versions. Fender HM Strat ultra differs in that it has 4 Lace Sensor pickups in HSS configuration (these pickups are considered less noisy/aggressive and sometimes less preferred for HM Strat than those found in the Fender HM Strat), a smaller 'digitalized' Strat logo (considered to be more discreet) and an ebony fingerboard with split-triangle inlays. The Fender logo on the headstock is of mother of pearl.
2020 Reissue -
At the 2020 NAMM Show, Fender introduced a limited edition reissue of the HM Strat. The reissue keeps the Gotoh tuners and HSS design, but replaces the Kahler Spyder tremolo with a Floyd Rose bridge and the DiMarzio and Lace Sensor pickups in previous versions with Fender-developed hi-gain pickups.
Background and user reception.
In 1985, a group of musically dedicated people and investors led by William Schultz purchased the Fender company from Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). The building that contained the equipment was not part of the sale, so the plant was relocated. During this period, when there was little to no production of instruments in the U.S., Fender imported instruments made by Fender Japan/FujiGen, many of which were the "Contemporary" Stratocasters and Telecasters. These were sold in the U.S., along with "vintage" spec models, from 1985 on up almost through the end of the HM Strat era. Thus, it is not unusual that a Fender HM strat may have Japanese-made components (e.g. neck) assembled in the US.
The Contemporary Stratocaster was eventually supplanted by the HM Strat in 1988, which went through subsequent versions. The first U.S. Fender Superstrat was the adaptation of the Japanese HM Strat, plus the addition of the U.S. Contemporary Stratocaster, in 1989.
However, this model was also opposed by Fender purists as its features were "off the Fender's beaten track". The use of a humbucker (instead of a single coil), 24 jumbo frets (instead of 21 or 22 regular frets) and occasionally basswood (instead of the typical alder or ash) as well as the overall appearance were not particularly welcomed by most conservative Fender fans. Today, a well-maintained Fender HM Strat becomes increasingly rare to find. As with most discontinued instruments, however, this guitar is also hard to maintain. For instance, although Kahler USA provides product support for the Kahler Spyder tremolo parts, various other components of this guitar such as knobs are currently unavailable.
Notable users.
The Fender HM strat was endorsed by Greg Howe. Many of which were featured on album covers up until 1995 "Parallax". In recent years, guitarist Ethan Brosh has been spotted playing old '80s HM Strats as his touring instrument of choice. Jeff Nations, guitarist for JB Crockett, also uses a U.S. HM Strat in his touring rig.

Sanyaakhunya

Sanyakhuna (Newari: सन्याखुना) is a special type of jelly-like food prepared and consumed primarily by the Newars of Nepal.
Buffalo stew is made with bones for extra flavor (taken out afterward) and gelatinous skin with meat attached is preferred. A good ratio of water (soup) is preferred. Spices are added. Some of the soup is taken out and juice of a local citric fruit (jhamsi in newari) which taste like lemon but with a flavor of mandarin is added for more flavor. Finally smoked dry freshwater fish is fried and added. It is cooled down to make a meat aspic jelly which is called sanyakhuna.
Sanya means dried fish and khuna means broth.

Betsy Wetsy

Betsy Wetsy was a "drink-and-wet" doll originally issued by the Ideal Toy Company of New York in 1937. It was one of the most popular dolls of its kind in the Post–World War II baby boom era.
Named for the daughter of Abraham Katz, the head of the company, the doll's special feature was simulating urination after a fluid was poured into her open mouth. Betsy Wetsy was also one of the first major dolls to be produced in African American versions.
Description.
Betsy Wetsy was produced with either molded plastic hair, karakul wigs, or brown, blonde, or red plugged hair. It had blue sleep eyes with eyelashes and its arms and legs were jointed. A layette, baby bottles, a plastic bath tub, and other accessories were available.
History.
Effanbee had previously manufactured a similar doll, "Dy-dee," and a patent infringement lawsuit resulted. The judge ruled that drinking and urinating are natural movements and cannot be patented.
The doll was made in several sizes in the 1940s. It saw a spike in popularity in the 1950s.
A made-in-China version was issued in the late 1980s by Ideal to boost sales, but the doll never reached the success of the original.
Other media.
Film.
Plans for a live-action film adaptation produced by Mattel Films and Aggregate Films was announced in January 2022.
Legacy.
In 2003, the Toy Industry Association named Betsy Wetsy to its Century of Toys List, a compilation commemorating the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century.

Patrick Reynolds (activist)

Patrick Cleveland Reynolds (born December 2, 1948) is an American anti-smoking activist and former actor.
Born in Miami Beach, Florida, he is the grandson of the tobacco company founder, R. J. Reynolds, and speaks of how he believes his family business has killed millions, including his father, R. J. Reynolds Jr., and half brother, R. J. Reynolds III. He is a frequent speaker on the dangers of smoking, and founded a non-profit organization dedicated to anti-tobacco campaigning.
Social activism.
In April 1986, Reynolds went with a friend to a meeting with U.S. Sen. Robert Packwood, where the issue of a proposed cut in tobacco tax was raised. Outraged, Reynolds stood up and asked why U.S. tobacco taxes were so low. By June 1986, Reynolds had become an anti-smoking activist, appearing in adverts for the American Lung Association and testifying before a congressional subcommittee at the invitation of Packwood, to the dismay of his family. He had already sold his tobacco stock in 1979, and from 1983 to 1985 tried to get hired by RJR Nabisco Inc. in an attempt to get the company to divest its tobacco holdings. Reynolds was a smoker for 17 years until 1985, when he quit after more than 10 years of trying. He has appeared on many national television programs.
In 1989, Reynolds founded The Foundation for a Smokefree America. That same year, Reynolds published "The Gilded Leaf" with Thomas Shachtman, chronicling three generations of his family and its tobacco business, a book he had been working on since 1980. The book was re-issued in 2006 (). In 2007 he released an educational video on DVD of a tobacco prevention talk he gave titled The Truth About Tobacco.
Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop M.D., called him "one of the nation's most influential advocates of a smokefree America." He continues to speak on tobacco control to adult groups, and also gives motivational prevention talks before high school and elementary school audiences. He advised the Greek government on anti-smoking measures in 2009, and in 2011 was seeking sponsorship for a world tour.
In 2011, Reynolds said friction with his family had eased. "[S]ince 1986, the price of the stock kept going up. And as far as being an embarrassment, I received an award from the World Health Organization; I brought honor to the Reynolds family."
Personal life.
His mother was his father's second wife Marianne O'Brien, an actress who appeared in films in the 1940s such as "The Very Thought of You" and was contracted to Jack L. Warner. His parents separated when he was 3 and he did not meet his father again until he was 9. His father died in 1964 of emphysema at age 58, leaving a will that disinherited Patrick, his brother, and four half-brothers. Reynolds, however, received $500,000 from his father's fourth wife after agreeing not to contest the will. He also inherited $2.5 million from his grandfather in 1969 when he was 21.
After attending The Hotchkiss School, Reynolds studied filmmaking at the University of California and the University of Southern California. He ventured into acting in 1975 during a visit to the set of the film "Nashville". His live-in girlfriend, actress Shelley Duvall, had invited him to the set, and director Robert Altman cast him in a small non-speaking role. Reynolds subsequently studied acting at several Los Angeles schools; with Milton Katselas, and classmates included Michelle Pfeiffer and Patrick Swayze. At the urging of his voice coach, he recorded three unreleased pop singles in 1982. He married his first wife Regina Wahl in Ofterschwang, West Germany, in July 1983, quit acting and briefly began working for her father's international bus company. He returned to acting after being offered a lead role in "Eliminators". His mother died in 1985. In 1986, he spoke out publicly for the first time against the tobacco industry. He remarried in 2007, and lives in Los Angeles with his wife Alexandra and their son, born in October 2009.

Wust is a village and a former municipality in the district of Stendal, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Since the 1st January 2010 it has been part of the municipality Wust-Fischbeck.
Geography and History.
The village is situated in northern Saxony-Anhalt not far from the river Elbe, near the old town of Tangermünde which was a favourite place of Kaiser Karl IV in the 14th century.
Wust consists of Wust, Sydow, Wusterdamm, and Melkow.
In centuries gone by, the squires of Wust were the noblemen von Katte, their most famous member was Hans Hermann von Katte, a young friend and possible lover of the later king Frederick II of Prussia, who spent his childhood in Wust. The Katte family were related to the squires of the nearby village of Schönhausen, of the Bismarck family.
The "Summer School for English language, literature, theatre and music" is a yearly event during the summer holidays in the small village. It is held over four weeks, divided into two courses; there are levels for beginners and for pupils with intermediate and advanced knowledge of English. Alongside the English lessons are other activities, such as workshops for art, photography, music, and sports. Participants can also partake in the theatre, which serves as the climax of the school's four weeks of activities. Since the mid-2000s, Shakespearean plays have been performed, including "Richard III" and "Love's Labours Lost", but also the more recently written "Ten" and the 2006 play "The Storyteller" (Der Märchenerzähler). Concerts and readings in the Romanesque Wust church or in the surrounding villages and towns are an important part of the overall summer school experience, both for participants and the community as a whole. The instructors are mainly students and English teachers from the UK and the United States.The main goal, besides promotion of education, is cultural exchange between Germany and English-speaking countries.
Sight Seeing.
The "romanesque church" which is a brick construction with a baroque interior is included at the northern end of the Romanesque street sight-seeing tour. Attached to the apse of the church, but with a separate entrance, lies the crypt with the mortal remains of the squires, called the "Kattegruft" which was built in 1706/07.
The "manor house" of the squires now serves as a primary school. The summer school has taken place here since 1991.
The old barn building ( the ""Kornspeicher")" is now a rustic place for exhibitions and concerts.

My Camera Never Lies

"My Camera Never Lies" is a 1982 single by pop group Bucks Fizz. It became the group's second consecutive (and third overall) UK number-one in April 1982. The song was written by Andy Hill and Nichola Martin, and was featured on Bucks Fizz's second album "Are You Ready".
Overview.
Background.
"My Camera Never Lies" was written by Andy Hill and Nichola Martin and produced by Andy Hill. Hill was the group's regular songwriter and producer, while Martin had been the woman who had put the group together and occasionally co-wrote some songs. This was her only No. 1 hit, although she also co-penned the follow-up, "Now Those Days Are Gone", which was a top 10 hit. Hill recorded the male vocals first since they were more straightforward and then added in the female parts. He considered the middle section with the members repeating "my camera" at each other to be the most complex part, but commended the group for mastering this sequence without prior rehearsal. The lyrics concern a man who is following his partner around to investigate her actions. The "camera" of the title being his view of the situation.
The promotional video which accompanied the song begins with shots of the group in a white room dressed in new romantic-style clothes. The group members are seen singing the song to camera (sometimes through an Olympus 35mm lens) in a blue-tinged studio. The chorus sees them performing the song's dance routine to camera while intercut with split-screen effects of all four members. Interspersed through the video are quick snippets of the group re-enacting scenes from famous movies including "Bonnie and Clyde", "Gone With the Wind", "The Wizard of Oz" and "Cleopatra".
Release and reception.
"My Camera Never Lies" was released on 12 March 1982 and entered the UK Singles chart at No. 33. The following week it rose dramatically to No. 5. Two weeks later it became the third UK number one single for Bucks Fizz for a single week in April 1982, and saw the group reach the peak of their career, being the follow-up to "The Land of Make Believe", which had also reached No. 1 a few months earlier. The single was one of the group's biggest hits and after a swift fall from the top, remained on the chart for eight weeks. This was to be the group's final No. 1, but gave Bucks Fizz their third chart topper in 12 months. It was one of the top 40 selling singles of the year. It peaked at No. 2 in Ireland but fared less well in other countries.
With this song, Bucks Fizz found themselves in favour with the music press who were normally damning of 'middle-of-the-road' pop. The song is considered by the group's fans to be among their best, while member Mike Nolan considers it one of their most mature singles but perhaps was released too early in their career. The single received a positive review in "NME" saying "[it] is a complex, almost excessive record that transcends the sphere of commercial mush into which it is born" comparing it to Heatwave, ABBA and contemporaries Dollar saying that "its almost too good to succeed". In 2015, Guardian journalist Bob Stanley commented favourably on the song calling it their "key record" albeit "relatively forgotten [for a number one single]". He goes on to say "ushered in on aerated harmonies, it cuts to a hard, shiny acoustic guitar riff and a lyric that could be about the narcissistic dullness of having 'made it', or the paranoia of surveillance, followed by a 'camera-ra-ra-ra' wherever you go". The same publication's reviewer Tom Ewing said that "My Camera Never Lies" was "trying to cram all of new wave and new pop into a single super-compressed hybrid, halfway between Devo and Dollar". Stanley also goes on to mention the single's B-side "What Am I Gonna Do" commenting on it switching from pop to rock between verse and chorus saying; "Does it hang together? Incredibly, it does".
"My Camera Never Lies" featured on the group's second album, "Are You Ready", released two months later. It featured a slightly longer version which extends the ending with overlaid drum sounds which then blend into the next track "Easy Love". Another extended version of the song was released on 12" single. A slight reworking with some re-recorded vocals was released on "The Lost Masters" album in 2006. In 2012 The Original Bucks Fizz re-recorded the song on their album "Fame and Fortune?" in a completely reworked slow-tempo style.

List of The Office (British TV series) episodes

"The Office" is a British sitcom that was originally broadcast by the BBC in the United Kingdom from 2001 to 2003 as the original series of "The Office". The television programme was created and written by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant; the former also played the main character, manager David Brent. The series is set in the Slough office of a fictional paper merchant, Wernham Hogg, and is presented in a mockumentary format depicting the everyday lives of its employees.
Brent tries to be a friend and an entertainer as well as a boss, and is often annoying as a result. His sycophantic assistant Gareth Keenan (Mackenzie Crook) annoys and is often pranked by sales representative Tim Canterbury (Martin Freeman), whose relationship with receptionist Dawn Tinsley (Lucy Davis) is a major story arc, despite her engagement to warehouse worker Lee (Joel Beckett). Minor characters include droning and crass office worker Keith Bishop (Ewen MacIntosh), Brent's brash and sexist friend Chris Finch (Ralph Ineson) and Brent's bosses Jennifer Taylor-Clarke (Stirling Gallacher) and later Neil Godwin (Patrick Baladi).
The programme ran for two series of six half-hour episodes each: the first aired from July to August 2001, and the second from September to November 2002. A two-part Christmas special aired on 26 and 27 December 2003. There are 14 episodes in total. Series 1 and 2 were originally broadcast on BBC Two, but the Christmas episodes were moved to BBC One to increase viewership following the previous series' popularity. Both series, as well as the Christmas specials, have been released on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4. The programme has won numerous awards, including two British Comedy Awards and two Golden Globe. "The Office" has also been remade in several countries, of which the American adaptation has been the most popular and longest-running.
Episodes were shot on tape, then filmised in post-production to achieve the documentary-type atmosphere. The deleted scenes on the DVDs are presented raw, pre-filmization.

Let's Talk About Sex (film)

Let's Talk About Sex is a 1998 American dramatic film written, directed by, and starring Troy Beyer. The film received generally negative reviews from critics.
Plot.
Jazz (Troy Beyer) works as a newspaper advice columnist located in Miami, Florida. The movie takes place over the span of a long weekend in which she interviews many women about sex, to edit into a pilot episode for a show called "Girl Talk".
MPAA controversy.
The film was originally rated NC-17 by the MPAA, but was edited for an R-rating. According to Beyer, among other items the MPAA would have required to give the film a lower rating, Beyer was asked to remove a scene where a fully dressed woman licks a peach in demonstration of cunnilingus. Beyer says that the scene was "heartfelt... It wasn't vulgar or demeaning to anyone." Regarding her experience with the MPAA, Beyer said, "I felt violated. I felt raped artistically."
The film has aired numerous times uncut on French television.
Reception.
Roger Ebert of "RogerEbert.com" gave the film a one-star negative review, criticising its portrayal of men. Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" called the film an "entertaining hodgepodge of quasi-documentary, soft-core porn, sex farce and psychobabbling soap opera", but criticised its lack of focus. Jonathan Rosenbaum of "The Chicago Reader" said the movie could be "phony" during big emotional scenes.

Virginia State Route 13

State Route 13 (SR 13) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. Known as Old Buckingham Road, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 60 and SR 45 in Cumberland east to US 60 in Plain View. SR 13 parallels US 60 to the south through eastern Cumberland County and western Powhatan County and passes through the latter county's seat of Powhatan. The state highway is the only state-numbered highway in Virginia that shares a number with a U.S. Highway but does not form a state-numbered extension of that U.S. Highway. SR 13's number comes from being a segment of the original cross-state SR 13 in 1918; that highway included portions of modern US 60. In 1933, US 60 was shifted to its present corridor between Buena Vista and Richmond, replacing SR 13. Two years later, SR 13 was assigned to Old Buckingham Road when US 60 was moved to its present alignment from Cumberland to east of Powhatan.
Route description.
SR 13 begins at an intersection with James Anderson Highway, a four-lane divided highway that carries US 60 and SR 45, in Cumberland. The state highway heads southeast as a two-lane undivided road and crosses the Cumberland–Powhatan county line. SR 13 continues through the communities of Tobaccoville, Ballsville, and Belona. At the hamlet of Macon, the state highway veers north, then turns east at an intersection with SR 1002 (Emmanuel Church Road). SR 1002 heads north a short distance to US 522's southern terminus at US 60. SR 13 briefly runs adjacent to US 60, then veers away through the county seat of Powhatan. At the county courthouse, the state highway meets the southern end of SR 300, which provides another connection to US 60. SR 13 passes through Worshams before reaching its eastern terminus at US 60 (James Anderson Highway) at Plain View.
History.
SR 13 is the remnant of a much longer route. It was part of the initial system defined in 1918, running from the West Virginia state line via Lexington, Lynchburg, Farmville, and Richmond to State Route 8 near Tappahannock. This corridor is now generally U.S. Route 60, U.S. Route 501, U.S. Route 460, State Route 45, U.S. Route 60, and U.S. Route 360. This was entirely concurrent with other routes west of Farmville - State Route 14 west of Lynchburg and State Route 10 from Lynchburg to Farmville - and so in the 1923 renumbering it was truncated to Farmville-Tappahannock.
The road from southeast of Warsaw to Callao was added to the state highway system in 1924, and the next year it was connected to the rest of SR 13 by the addition of the road from Tappahannock to Warsaw.
To the west, a short piece of road from State Route 2 at Sprouses Corner west to Buckingham was added in 1923, and later that year it was assigned the State Route 322 designation as a spur of State Route 32 (formerly SR 2). Disconnected extensions of SR 322 were added in 1924 on both sides of Amherst and in 1925 in both directions from both segments. Further extensions of SR 322 were planned in 1926, but, later that year, SR 322 was renumbered as an extension of SR 13; the short piece from Cumberland southwest to Farmville became State Route 133 (renumbered State Route 310 in the 1928 renumbering, and part of State Route 45 in the 1933 renumbering).
The road from Buena Vista west to State Route 14 at McCormick's Gate (now the junction of U.S. Route 60 and State Route 608/Pathfinder Drive) was added in 1924. This became part of the SR 13 extension, but in 1928, SR 14 was rerouted to pass through Buena Vista and use that piece of road, and thus SR 13 was truncated to Buena Vista. In 1927 and 1928, the remaining pieces of SR 13 were added, making SR 13 a continuous route from SR 14 in Buena Vista east to Callao.
Until the 1933 renumbering, no significant portions of SR 13 were concurrent with U.S. Routes. In 1933, U.S. Route 60 was shifted north from the Lynchburg-Burkeville alignment (now U.S. Route 501, U.S. Route 460, and U.S. Route 360) to replace SR 13 from Buena Vista to Richmond, and U.S. Route 360 was designated over SR 13 from Richmond to Callao; thus SR 13 was completely eliminated in 1933.
However, a new cutoff between Cumberland and east of Powhatan was planned as State Route 13 Alternate. A short piece west of Powhatan had been added to the state highway system in 1932 as part of State Route 46 (now State Route 684 in that area), but the main part was added in 1933 and 1934 (specifically as US 60 in the latter year). By 1935, the new US 60 was complete, and the old route reverted to its old designation - State Route 13.

Carnosaur (film series)

The Carnosaur film series consists of B-movies produced by Roger Corman that feature genetically engineered dinosaurs running amok in various scenarios. The series started with the first "Carnosaur" film, released in 1993, that was loosely based on the 1984 novel "Carnosaur" by John Brosnan. Two sequels were released direct-to-video: "Carnosaur 2" in 1995, and "" in 1996.
Two subsequent films use footage from the "Carnosaur" films: "Raptor" (2001) and "The Eden Formula" (2006).
Films.
"Carnosaur" (1993).
"Carnosaur" was written and directed by Adam Simon, and was released to theaters on May 14, 1993. The film is loosely based on the 1984 novel "Carnosaur" by John Brosnan. In the film, Dr. Jane Tiptree (Diane Ladd), a mad scientist specializing in agricultural genetic engineering, uses chickens from the plant she works at to breed dinosaurs. She also creates a virus containing dinosaur DNA that will impregnate women with dinosaurs and kill them after birth, so the animals can wreak havoc and exterminate humanity, which she believes needs to be destroyed so that the dinosaurs can rule the planet once again. An alcoholic security guard and an environmental activist attempt to stop her and the dinosaurs, and the military is later sent in to kill the town residents and quarantine the virus. The film was a modest box-office success, reportedly grossing $1,753,979, despite a limited theatrical release.
"Carnosaur 2" (1995).
Directed by Louis Morneau and written by Michael Palmer, "Carnosaur 2" was released direct-to-video in February 1995. Starring John Savage and Cliff DeYoung, the film features a group of technicians called in to investigate the power shortage at a top-secret mining facility, only to discover it is actually a remote nuclear dump site where the government transported the dinosaurs from the first film. The dinosaurs have overrun the facility, and now the technicians must try to survive while avoiding a radiation leak and trying to keep the dinosaurs from escaping the facility.
"Carnosaur 3: Primal Species" (1996).
Released direct-to-video in November 1996, "Carnosaur 3: Primal Species" was directed by Jonathan Winfrey and starred Scott Valentine and Janet Gunn. The film involves a group of terrorists who attempt to steal a large shipment of uranium, but instead realize that they have seized a truckload of cloned dinosaurs, which escape. A military team is then sent to contain the creatures.
"Raptor" (2001).
"Raptor" was directed by Jim Wynorski and was released direct-to-video on November 6, 2001. It re-uses dinosaur footage from the three "Carnosaur" films and cuts them together with new footage shot by Wynorski. The film was created through Roger Corman's company New Concorde, which had worked on the "Carnosaur" films. The film focuses on a small town sheriff (Eric Roberts) and an animal control officer (Melissa Brasselle) investigating a series of deaths by genetically engineered dinosaurs that escape from a nearby laboratory (mainly "Velociraptor"s), while also dealing with their creator Dr. Hyde (Corbin Bernsen).
"The Eden Formula" (2006).
"The Eden Formula" was written and directed by John Carl Buechler, who worked on the dinosaur effects for the "Carnosaur" trilogy. The film includes recycled footage from the trilogy combined with new footage. The film was originally released on DVD in Australia, before getting a U.S. DVD release in 2007. Starring Jeff Fahey, Tony Todd and Dee Wallace, the plot revolves around a group of spies who accidentally release a cloned "Tyrannosaurus" onto the streets of Los Angeles.

The Scarlet Letter (1973 film)

The Scarlet Letter () is a 1973 period drama film directed by Wim Wenders, based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1850 novel of the same name. The West German-Spanish co-production stars Senta Berger as Hester Prynne, Lou Castel as Reverend Dimmesdale, and Hans Christian Blech as Chillingworth.
Production.
Filming took place at a studio in Cologne, with exteriors shot in Galicia, Spain. The look of the evening shots outdoors utilized the existing day for night techniques of exposure.
According to the director's commentary, Wim Wenders explained that the experience of directing this, his second film, was the usual one which occurs with a new director. It is much more difficult and much less successful. In the interior shots, the windows were covered with a variant of washi paper seen in traditional Japanese homes.
Wenders has said that he unhappy that the movie was filmed on locations in Spain instead of Massachusetts, saying also that in 1971 he was too young and not prepared to make a 16th-century period movie.
There are a few brief shots in which one sees a three-masted ship on the ocean in the background. This was not a real ship but was a small model sized correctly for the shot and hung in front of the lens (called forced perspective). Only one extra building had to be erected in Galicia for the exterior shooting to hide the large gap between buildings.
As far as the actors were concerned, they were from all over Europe and so all of the dialogue had to be looped afterward. Six or seven different languages were being spoken by the actors. The extras which represent the inhabitants of Salem were all Spaniards.

Castrapo

Castrapo (a portmanteau of and , meaning "rag") is a term used in the region of Galicia to refer to a local variety of the Castilian language that uses a lot of code-switching, vocabulary, syntax and expressions directly from the Galician language although they do not exist or have equivalents in Standard Castilian. This way of speaking is mainly prevalent in the densely populated urban areas of Galicia and is sometimes stereotyped as "the way Galician politicians speak".
Origin.
The phenomenon of Castrapo traces back its origins to the imposition of the Castilian language in Galicia and the attempted Castilianization of the region after it was absorbed by the Kingdom of Castile (also known as the "Doma y castración del Reino de Galicia"; "Domination and castration of the Kingdom of Galicia" by Galicianist authors such as Castelao). The Galician language lost its officiality during the era known as the "Seculos Escuros" (Dark Centuries), and it was no longer studied at schools, used by religious organizations or any administrative entity. It became a de-facto spoken language by the Galician people and its use was reduced to family situations and private life although it has always stayed the most commonly-spoken language in Galicia.
Some Galicianist intellectuals like Manuel María viewed Castrapo as a threat to the Galician language by Castilianization.
Definition and usage.
The standard Galician dictionary published by the Royal Galician Academy defines it as a "variation of the Castilian language, distinguished by the abundance of words and expressions taken from Galician language".
Some Galician reintegrationist groups, which advocate for the unity of Galician-Portuguese as a modern single language, may also use the word "Castrapo" to refer disapprovingly to the current standard form of Galician that is regulated by the Royal Galician Academy, which they consider to be too influenced by Castilian and artificially distanced from modern Portuguese.
Examples.
The phrase "Close the window" would be "Pecha a ventana". In Standard Castilian, it would be ; in Galician, it would be ; and in Portuguese, it would be .
Phonology.
Final unstressed and are frequently raised to and in the Castilian that is spoken in rural Galicia.

Automobile and Touring Club of Greece

The Automobile and Touring Club of Greece ( (ΕΛΠΑ), "Elliniki Leschi Periigiseon kai Aftokinitou", ELPA) was a Greek motor sports organisation which organized every racing event in Greece, including the world famous Acropolis Rally.
Founded in 1926 and was a member of the International Automobile Federation (FIA) and the International Federation of Motorcycling (FIM) since 1927, ELPA services Greek and foreign motorists inside and outside Greece. Before World War II, ELPA had undertaken putting up traffic signs along the Greek road network, an effort financed from its own funds and continued until 1957, when the Greek Government undertook this responsibility. ELPA is also actively engaged in the tourist services sector, providing information and publishing maps - the first road maps of Greece were created by the ELPA.
From its early years, ELPA has been involved in organizing national and international car and motorcycle races. The most prominent of these, was the annual Acropolis Rally, which started in 1952 and provided a major boost to Greek tourism. 
Since 1993, the racing department of ELPA has supported the National Special Olympics Team, especially the cycling team.
ELPA is reported to be now defunct,

Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005

The Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 () is an Act of the Scottish Parliament passed in 2005. It was the first piece of legislation dedicated to the Scottish Gaelic language and was seen as the first step by the Scottish Executive to provide a legislative framework for the use of Gaelic by Scottish Public sector authorities. It created a Gaelic Language Board, but created no general rights of citizens or obligations on statutory authorities to actually use the language. This is in contrast to the UK parliament's legislation for the Welsh Language (the Welsh Language Act 1993) which authorises the use of Welsh in public administration.
Passage of the Act.
The bill was introduced into the Scottish Parliament on 28 September 2004 by Peter Peacock. On 21 April 2005 the Parliament voted unanimously to approve the bill.
Purpose.
The Gaelic Language Act aims to secure Gaelic as an official language of Scotland, "commanding equal respect" with English, by establishing as part of the framework of government in Scotland and also requiring the creation of a national plan for Gaelic to provide strategic direction for the development of the Gaelic language. The phrase "equal respect" contains no clear meaning in the law. Its usage was chosen to prevent the assumption that the Gaelic language is in any way considered to have "equal validity or parity of esteem with English".
The Act also gives a key role in promoting Gaelic in Scotland, advising Scottish Ministers on Gaelic issues, driving forward Gaelic planning and preparing guidance on Gaelic education. The Act also provides a framework for the creation of Gaelic language plans by Scottish public authorities.
Peter Peacock, who, at the time of the Act coming into force, had ministerial responsibility for Gaelic, said: "This is a momentous day for Gaelic as we open a new chapter in the language's history. We have come a long way since the dark days of 1616 when an Act of Parliament ruled that Gaelic should be 'abolishit and removit' from Scotland."
A key limitation of the act is that it applies only to public bodies operating in Scotland and whose business is classed as being a devolved matter (outlined by the Scotland Act 1998).
The National Gaelic Language Plan 2012–17.
"The Plan includes proposals for the promotion of strategies for increasing the number able to speak Gaelic, encouraging its use and facilitating access to Gaelic language and culture." The Plan addresses the following:
Further developments.
In 2024, the Scottish Languages Bill was introduced to the Scottish Parliament, which would give recognition to the Scots language and build on the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005.

Pee Wee Crayton

Connie Curtis Crayton (December 18, 1914 – June 25, 1985), known as Pee Wee Crayton, was an American R&amp;B and blues guitarist and singer.
Career.
Crayton was born in Rockdale, Texas. He began playing guitar seriously after moving to California in 1935, later settling in Oakland. While there, he absorbed the music of T-Bone Walker, who taught Crayton the basics of electric guitar work. Crayton developed his own unique approach.
In 1948, he signed a recording contract with Modern Records. One of his first recordings was the instrumental "Blues After Hours", which reached number 1 on the "Billboard" R&amp;B chart late that year. Its B-side, the pop ballad "I'm Still in Love with You", and the quicker "Texas Hop" are good examples of his work.
In 1950, Crayton and his Orchestra performed at the sixth Cavalcade of Jazz concert, held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles and produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on June 25. Featured on the same day were Lionel Hampton, Roy Milton's Orchestra, Dinah Washington, Tiny Davis and Her Hell Divers, and other artists. 16,000 were reported to be in attendance. The concert ended early because of a fracas while Lionel Hampton played "Flying High".
He went on to record for many other record labels in the 1950s, including Imperial in New Orleans, Vee-Jay in Chicago and Jamie in Philadelphia. It is thought he was the first blues guitarist to use a Fender Stratocaster, playing one given to him by Leo Fender.
His opening guitar riff on the 1954 single "Do Unto Others" was "quoted" by John Lennon in the beginning of the B-side single version of "Revolution" released by The Beatles on Apple Records in 1968.
Crayton’s album "Things I Used to Do" was released by Vanguard Records in 1971. He continued to tour and record in the following years.
A longtime resident of Los Angeles, California, Crayton died there of a heart attack in 1985. He was interred in the Inglewood Park Cemetery.
Legacy.
On May 8, 2019, Crayton was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame by long-time friend Doug MacLeod in a ceremony held in Memphis, Tennessee by the Blues Foundation.

George Henry Morris

Lieutenant-Colonel George Henry Morris (16 July 1872 – 1 September 1914) was the first commanding officer to lead an Irish Guards battalion into battle.
Early life.
George Henry Morris was born in Spiddal, County Galway, Ireland, the second son of Michael Morris, 1st Baron Killanin, and was educated at The Oratory School, Edgbaston. He joined The Rifle Brigade in India as Second Lieutenant in 1892, after having passed out from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.
Military career.
In 1897 Morris was appointed adjutant of the 3rd Battalion, Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own), a position he held for four years. He saw active service with the Tochi Valley Expeditionary Force in 1897–98, receiving the medal with clasp.
In the second Second Boer War he served with Damant's Horse from 1901 to 1902, participating in operations in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony. He was twice Mentioned in Dispatches (including one dated 1 June 1902, where he is commended for good service during the Battle of Boschbult 31 March 1902) and received the Queen's South Africa Medal with four clasps.
On the conclusion of the war he rejoined the Staff College, which he had entered in January 1902, and passed out in 1903. Obtaining his majority on transfer to the Irish Guards in March 1906, he was next a General Staff Officer at the Army Staff College from 1908 to 1911, finally becoming Lieutenant-Colonel when succeeding Charles FitzClarence to the command of the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards in July 1913.
Morris took his battalion to France on 12 August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I and was killed in action on 1 September, during the Retreat from Mons when the 4th (Guards) Brigade formed a rear-guard for the 2nd Division in La forêt de Retz near Villers-Cotterêts where he is buried in the Guards' Grave.
Morris was recognised as one of the most brilliant lecturers in the British Army, and was an authority on strategy, tactics, and military history. He was a member of the Guards' Club, the Garrick Club and the County Galway Club.
Personal life.
On 29 April 1913, he married Dora Maryan Hall, second daughter of James Wesley Hall, of Melbourne, Australia, younger brother of Walter Russell Hall at Westminster Cathedral in London.
Their son Michael Morris, born on 30 July 1914, succeeded as Lord Killanin when his uncle Martin Henry FitzPatrick Morris, 2nd Baron Killanin died in 1927 without an heir. He went on to serve as the sixth President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) from 1972 to 1980.
After Lt.-Col. Hon. George Henry Morris's death, Dora Maryan Hall married Colonel Gerard Tharp on 12 March 1918. She died on 5 May 1948.

Arkansas Highway 265

Arkansas Highway 265 (AR 265) is a designation for three state highways in Northwest Arkansas. The southern segment of runs from Highway 170 near Strickler north to Interstate 49 (I-49) in Fayetteville. 
A second segment runs from Highway 16 in Fayetteville north to Highway 94 in Rogers. Further north, a third segment of runs from Highway 94 in Pea Ridge north to the Missouri state line. The highways are maintained by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ARDOT).
Parts of all three segments are former lengths of the Butterfield Stagecoach Route, a route established in 1857 that carried United States mail from St. Louis, Missouri to San Francisco, California.
Route description.
Strickler to Fayetteville.
AR 265 begins in a rural part of southern Washington County within the Northwest Arkansas and Ozark Mountain regions. Starting at an intersection with Highway 170, the highway runs near SEFOR, a deactivated experimental fast breeder reactor before passing through the unincorporated community of Strickler. Continuing north as a winding, two-lane highway, the highway passes near the headwaters of the Illinois River and serves as the western terminus of AR 156 at Hogeye. Upon entering Greenland, AR 265 intersects Wilson Street, which gives access to Interstate 49 (I-49). AR 265 continues north into Fayetteville, passing the Kessler Mountain Regional Park and beginning to parallel the Razorback Greenway. The route meets I-49 southbound and an unsigned AR 16. The route terminates at the I-49 on/off ramps, with the roadway continuing as AR 16.
Fayetteville to Springdale.
The route begins again at Highway 16 in southeast Fayetteville. The highway serves as the entrance to many communities, and is four-lane with center turn lane throughout Fayetteville. Highway 265 intersects Highway 45, Township Road, Joyce Blvd, Don Tyson Parkway, and US 412 before reaching the Springdale Municipal Airport. The route continues north, entering Benton County and intersecting Highway 264 in Bethel Heights. Continuing north, Highway 265 passes through undeveloped areas of Bethel Heights and Lowell without any state highway junctions as a two-lane road with a two-way left turn lane to Rogers, where it terminates at Highway 94 (New Hope Road).
Pea Ridge to Missouri.
A third segment begins at Highway 94 west of Pea Ridge and runs north to the Missouri state line before where it becomes Missouri Route KK.
History.
Although not one of Arkansas' original state highways, the path that Highway 265 follows is one of the state's oldest. Originally a Native American trace named the Great Osage Trail, the route was first used as a Military Road from St. Louis to Fort Smith, and later as the Trail of Tears. The Butterfield Overland Mail Route was active from 1857 to 1861 on the route. The route carried U.S. mail, and also carried telegraph lines west. Portions of the route are named Old Wire Road (also Old Missouri Road in Fayetteville) paying homage to the route's past. Although not all parts of Highway 265 are the exact path followed by the stage coaches, nor are all parts of Old Wire Road separate of Highway 265. This comes from the fact that there were many different alignments of the historic routes. Although there is no doubt about the southern segment's accuracy, Highway 265 is known as Old Missouri Road (or Crossover Rd.) paralleled by Old Wire Road in Fayetteville, but it is not clear to the traveler which route is more historically accurate.
The Strickler to Fayetteville segment was designated in 1958. Another AR 265 was later designated as a connector between Highway 16 and Highway 45, with this route being extended to its current alignment in 1973. The northernmost segment was designated in 1973, and was most recently paved in 1990.
Related routes.
Springdale spur.
Highway 265 Spur was a spur route in Springdale. It was in length and was removed from the system in the 1990s, now named Butterfield Coach Road and Emma Avenue.
Highway 383.
Highway 383 was a north–south highway along Old Missouri Road in Springdale, Arkansas. Its southern terminus was Highway 68 (now known as U.S. Highway 412) with its northern terminus at Highway 68N (also known as Emma Avenue). It was used primarily as a local access road to nearby Parson's Arena.
In the 1980s, Highway 383 was redesignated as an extension of Highway 265.

Muscle arms

Muscle arms are body wall muscle (BWM) membrane extensions that connect the BWMs to the motor axons of the dorsal and ventral nerve cords in the nematode worm "C. elegans". Muscle arms were first described in other nematode species by Anton Schneider (1831 – 1890) in his "Monographie der Nematoden", published in 1866. Subsequent work showed that muscle arms are found in C. elegans and that these structures are abnormal in unc-104, unc-5 and other mutants.

<doc id="6949137" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6949137" title="Melinoë">
Melinoë

Melinoë (; ) is a chthonic goddess invoked in one of the "Orphic Hymns" (2nd or 3rd centuries AD?), and represented as a bringer of nightmares and madness. In the hymn, Melinoë has characteristics that seem similar to Hecate and the Erinyes, and Melinoë's name is sometimes thought to be an epithet of Hecate. The name "Melinoë" also appears on a metal tablet in association with Persephone.
Name.
"Melinoë" may derive from Greek "mēlinos" (μήλινος), "having the colour of quince", from "mēlon" (μῆλον), "tree fruit". The fruit's yellowish-green colour evoked the pallor of illness or death for the Greeks.
"Orphic Hymn".
"Orphic Hymn" 71 is addressed to Melinoë, and describes her as follows (in the translation by Apostolos Athanassakis and Benjamin M. Wolkow):
I call upon Melinoë, saffron-cloaked nymph of the earth,&lt;br&gt;whom revered Persephone bore by the mouth of the Kokytos river&lt;br&gt;upon the sacred bed of Kronian Zeus.&lt;br&gt;In the guise of Plouton Zeus tricked Persephone and through wiley plots bedded her;&lt;br&gt;a two-bodied specter sprang forth from Persephone's fury.&lt;br&gt;This specter drives mortals to madness with her airy apparitions&lt;br&gt;as she appears in weird shapes and strange forms,&lt;br&gt;now plain to the eye, now shadowy, now shining in the darkness—&lt;br&gt;all this in unnerving attacks in the gloom of night.&lt;br&gt;O goddess, O queen of those below, I beseech you&lt;br&gt;to banish the soul's frenzy to the ends of the earth,&lt;br&gt;show to the initiates a kindly and holy face.
Birth.
Melinoë is the daughter of Persephone and was fathered by Zeus, who tricked her via "wily plots" by taking the form of Hades, indicating that in the hymn Persephone is already married to Hades. This is paralleled with another Orphic myth, the birth of Zagreus, who was conceived when Zeus, disguised as a serpent, deceived and mated with Persephone. Melinoë is born at the mouth of the Cocytus, one of the rivers of the underworld, where the Chthonic Hermes is stationed in his role as psychopomp. In the Orphic tradition, the Cocytus is one of four underworld rivers.
Although some Greek myths deal with themes of incest, in Orphic genealogies lines of kinship express theological and cosmogonical concepts, not the realities of human family relations. The ancient Greek "nymphē" in the first line can mean "nymph", but also "bride" or "young woman". Thus Melinoë is described as such not in order to be designated as a divinity of lower status, but rather as a young woman of marriageable age; the same word is applied to Hecate and Tethys (a Titaness) in their own Orphic hymns. As an underworld "queen" "(Basileia, Βασιλεία)", Melinoë is at least partially syncretized with Persephone herself.
Attributes and functions.
Melinoë is described in the invocation of the "Orphic Hymn" as "κροκόπεπλος (krokopeplos)," "clad in saffron" (see "peplos"), an epithet also used for Eos, the personification of dawn. In the hymns, only two goddesses are described as "krokopeplos," Melinoë and Hecate.
Melinoë's connections to Hecate and Hermes suggest that she exercised her power in the realm of the soul's passage, and in that function may be compared to the torchbearer Eubuleus in the mysteries. According to the hymn about her, Melinoë brings night terrors to mortals by manifesting in strange forms, "now plain to the eye, now shadowy, now shining in the darkness", and can drive mortals insane.
Inscriptions.
Melinoë appears on a bronze tablet for use in the kind of private ritual usually known as "magic". The style of Greek letters on the tablet, which was discovered at Pergamon, dates it to the first half of the 3rd century AD. The use of bronze was probably intended to drive away malevolent spirits and to protect the practitioner. The construction of the tablet suggests that it was used for divination. It is triangular in shape, with a hole in the center, presumably for suspending it over a surface.
The content of the triangular tablet reiterates triplicity. It depicts three crowned goddesses, each with her head pointing at an angle and her feet pointing toward the center. The name of the goddess appears above her head: Dione (ΔΙⲰΝΗ), Phoebe (ΦΟΙΒΙΗ), and the obscure Nyche (ΝΥΧΙΗ). "Amibousa," a word referring to the phases of the moon, is written under each goddess's feet. Densely inscribed spells frame each goddess: the inscriptions around Dione and Nyche are "voces magicae", incantatory syllables ("magic words") that are mostly untranslatable. Melinoë appears in a triple invocation that is part of the inscription around Phoebe: "O Persephone, O Melinoë, O Leucophryne". Esoteric symbols are inscribed on the edges of the triangle.
In popular culture.
Melinoë is the protagonist of the video game "Hades II", developed and published by Supergiant Games. In the game, Melinoë is the Princess of the Underworld and sister of Zagreus, the protagonist of the first game. She seeks to defeat Chronos with help from Hecate, the Olympian gods, and other figures from Greek mythology.

"Remember Me with Love" is a song by Cuban-American singer-songwriter Gloria Estefan. It was written by Estefan, and produced by her husband, Emilio Estefan, Jr., Jorge Casas and Clay Ostwald. The song was released on May 27, 1991 by Epic Records in the United Kingdom only as the third official single from her second album, "Into the Light" (1991). The US saw "Can't Forget You" as the third official single from the album, whereas "Nayib’s Song (I Am Here for You)" was released in some European markets as the third official single from the aforementioned album. "Remember Me with Love" was a moderate hit in the UK, reaching the top 30 and was promoted with a music video featuring a live performance by Estefan at a concert in the Netherlands.
Critical reception.
In a 2021 retrospective review, Matthew Hocter from Albumism noted that "Remember Me with Love" is "a love song clearly dedicated to her husband. Stripped back, melancholic and raw, it is an extra layer of gratitude within an already grateful album. Beautiful." Bill Wyman from "Entertainment Weekly" wrote that the song is "distinctive", "simple, plaintive, and unpretentious." David Quantick from "NME" described it as "wisting".

Bill Brennan (boxer)

Bill Brennan (June 23, 1893 – June 15, 1924) was an American boxer who fought and lost to World Heavyweight Champion Jack Dempsey in a well attended title fight that ended in a twelfth-round knockout on December 14, 1920, in Madison Square Garden. He lost to Dempsey for the first time in a non-title fight on February 5, 1918, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in a sixth-round technical knockout.
He began fighting under the name Bill Shanks, close to his actual name, and knocked out 11 of his first 12 opponents, fighting in the Midwest and then the New York City area. He had a strong punch and an exceptional knockout percentage. Brennan's manager was Leo P. Flynn and his trainers included Dia Dollings and Frank Cline.
Early life and career.
Brennan was born on June 23, 1893, in Louisville, Kentucky. Though many sources of his time stated he was born in County Mayo, Ireland or Chicago, these are fabrications he perpetuated to bolster the myth of his Irish ancestry. He was, in fact, of Scots-Irish, English, Irish, and German ancestry. He did live in the Chicago area during his early boxing career before moving to Manhattan where the boxing was more lucrative, and there were still plenty of Irish fans who would flock to see who they assumed was a native son.
Between May 1913 through May 1916 Brennan started professional boxing primarily in the New York area. With a powerful punch, he won an impressive 11 of his first fifteen fights by knockout losing only once in his first bout in Wisconsin. Brennan worked as a Bartender between fights, earning him the nickname "Battling Bill the Bartender".
According to one source, Brennan achieved a third-round knockout of Jack Cameron in 1914, and two ten-round newspaper decisions from Marty Cutler on April 13 and July 2, 1914, in Aurora, Illinois. Cutler fought some talented opposition in his career including Jack Johnson, Sam Langford, and Jack Dillon, though his record was poor.
Highlights of early career knockouts and wins, 1916.
On January 22, 1916, he knocked out 6' 1" heavyweight George Rodel in the seventh round at the Clermont Rink in Brooklyn. On March 20, 1916, Brennan knocked out Brooklyn-born Italian boxer Al Benedict in the second round at the Military Athletic Club in Brooklyn, New York. Both were important wins that brought him recognition in his early career.
On May 1, 1916, Brennan achieved a second-round knockout of 6 foot, Buffalo native George "One Round" Davis, a competent heavyweight, in Rochester, New York. On May 4, 1916, he TKO'd Rodel in the third round at the same location.
On May 16, 1916, Brennan achieved a sixth-round technical knockout of Al Williams at the Pioneer Sporting Club in New York City.
On May 23, 1916, he knocked out Tony Ross in the eighth round. Ross would meet some of the greatest heavyweights of his day, including a heavyweight title bout with Black boxing great Jack Johnson on June 30, 1919.
On May 24, 1916, Brennan fought Andre Anderson to a twelve-round draw on points in Thornton, Rhode Island.
On July 1, 1916, he knocked out Alfred "Soldier" Kearns in the eighth round at the Averne Athletic Club in Queens, New York. Kearns was considered a strong puncher though Brennan possessed a two-inch advantage in reach.
On July 15, 1916, he defeated Joe Cox in a ten-round newspaper decision of the "Brooklyn Daily Eagle" at the Broadway Arena in Brooklyn, New York. He beat Cox again on January 29, 1917, at Rochester, New York in a ten-round newspaper decision of the "Rochester Herald".
On July 21, 1916, he knocked out Jack Hubbard in the third round at the Flower City Athletic Club in Rochester, New York. He knocked out Hubbard in the second round on January 6, 1917, at the Broadway Sports Club in Brooklyn, New York. According to one source Brennan had previously defeated Hubbard in a fourteenth-round knockout in 1914, while Hubbard was boxing as "Jumbo Wells".
On October 26, 1916, he knocked out Tim Logan in a second-round TKO at the Manhattan Casino in New York City.
On December 30, 1916, Brennan defeated Jack Keating in a third round Technical Knockout at Queensboro Athletic Club in Long Island City, in Queens, New York.
Highlights of early career knockouts and wins, 1917.
On June 9, 1917, Brennan knocked out Sailor Jack Carroll in the second round at the Pioneer Sporting Club in New York. Brennan dropped Carroll with a right to the jaw in the first minute of the second round. Carroll had been substituting for another boxer. Though not having a stellar record, Carroll met some top talent during his career, including Gunboat Smith and two bouts with Battling Levinsky. Carroll lost to Levinsky on March 9, 1916, in New London, Connecticut, in a match promoted by Jewish boxer Abe Hollandersky.
On June 12, and July 20, 1917, Brennan achieved two tenth-round newspaper wins at first the Broadway and then the Harlem Sports Clubs against Bob Devere in New York City. In their June 12 bout, Brennan took a nine count in the sixth round, though the fighting was close. In the remaining three rounds of the bout, Brennan had Devere groggy. In their July 20 bout, Brennan was described as being on the aggressive throughout and carrying the fight the entire way. On March 30, 1920, Brennan won a ten-round newspaper decision from the "Chicago Tribune" over Devere in Chicago, Illinois. The battle was hard-fought, with Devere cut over the left eye in the seventh, and showing fatigue by the finish.
On July 3, 1917, Brennan knocked out Soldier Jones in a second-round technical knockout at the Grande Alle Rink in Quebec City, Quebec.
On November 1, 1917, Brennan first defeated Joe Bonds at the Unity Cycle Club in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in a second-round knockout. On April 28, 1917, he defeated Bonds again at the Broadway Sporting Club in Brooklyn, New York, in a ten-round newspaper decision. On December 20, 1918, Brennan achieved a newspaper decision third-round TKO against Bonds by the "Syracuse Herald" at the Arena in Syracuse, New York.
On November 9, 1917, Brennan drew with 6' 3" New York heavyweight Jim Coffey by newspaper decision in ten rounds at the Harlem Sports Club. The "Buffalo Courier" gave each four rounds with two even. Brennan connected with a wicked right to the jaw that nearly dropped Coffey in the third, but the fighting was give and take in most rounds. Coffey took considerable punishment in the bout but was never dropped to the mat.
Bouts with Battling Levinsky, 1917–18.
Brennan fought 1916–20 World Light Heavyweight Champion Battling Levinsky three times in 1917, on October 2 and 23 at the Armory in Boston, to a twelve-round draw and a twelve-round points decision. He had a rare loss to Levinsky on November 27, 1917, in a twelve-round points decision in Boston, before a twelve-round pre-agreed draw on points at the Grand Opera House in Boston on January 5, 1918. The spectators would not have been pleased had they known the draw was pre-arranged. Levinsky held the World Light Heavyweight Championship at the time, though none of his bouts with Brennan were title matches.
On December 1, 1919, Brennan knocked out five foot eleven inch Irish boxer Tom "Bearcat" McMahon in the second of fifteen rounds at Heinemann Park in New Orleans. The New Orleans "Times-Picayune" suspected McMahon may have had such a difficult time in the first round that he chose to take the count in the second rather than face any more rounds with Brennan. Brennan fought a ten-round newspaper decision draw with McMahon in LaSalle, Illinois on June 18, 1918. On November 5, 1917, Brennan won a ten-round newspaper decision of the "Rochester Herald" in Rochester, New York. McMahon was a good, though not great boxer from Brennan's era.
Four important bouts with 1923 World Middleweight Champion Harry Greb, 1919.
One of his toughest and best known opponents, Brennan fought Harry Greb four times in 1919, losing three bouts by newspaper decisions, and one on points.
The two first met on February 10, 1919, at the Arena in Syracuse, New York, with Greb winning in a ten-round newspaper decision. The "Syracuse Herald" gave Greb every one of the ten rounds. As was typical of Greb's style, he took the lead and attacked Brennan with a flurry of lefts and rights to both head and body in the first few rounds. Brennan fought solidly back for the first four rounds, but then tired and Greb took over. The first two rounds were slow, the next four were give and take, but the final four were dominated by Greb. On March 17, 1919, Greb won by newspaper decision again in a ten-round bout in Duquesne Gardens in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Greb took the bout with a "quickness, speed, and busy style" that were too much for Brennan, though Brennan fought back and did not resort to a defensive shell. Brennan landed his best punch in round ten, which only seemed to rile Greb, and make him more aggressive. On July 4, 1919, Greb met Brennan at Convention Hall in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and won the bout in a fifteen-round points decision. The "Tulsa World" wrote that Greb won seven rounds, Brennan winning only the fourth round, with seven rounds even. Once again, Greb won the final rounds as Brennan tired.
On August 23, 1919, Greb defeated Brennan in a ten-round newspaper decision at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. The "Washington Post" wrote that Greb outfought Brennan in every round, though the "Pittsburgh Post" gave Greb six rounds, Brennan two, and two were even. The fight was in the afternoon under a hot sun which seemed to slow Greb. Greb won the late rounds as Brennan tired. Greb was outweighed by twenty pounds, and gave away five inches in height. He was the better boxer, however, and became the American Light Heavyweight Champion in 1922. Brennan was bleeding from the nose in every round, and his left eye was cut in the tenth.
On April 23, 1920, Brennan knocked out Walter "Farmer" Lodge, also known as "Soldier" Lodge in the third round at the Moose Club in Detroit, Michigan. Brennan was dropped for a count of four in the first round which excited the audience. Lodge was described as being 6' 4", one of Brennan's few opponents who would have had a reach advantage. In a subsequent round Lodge was down and out for "a full ten minutes".
Bouts with future Hall of Famer Billy Miske, 1919–21.
Brennan fought future Hall of Famer Billy Miske twice in 1919, once on June 28 in Oklahoma to a fifteen-round loss on points, and on April 28 at Cardinal Field in St. Louis to an eight-round newspaper decision draw. He lost to Miske again on June 8, 1921, at the Auditorium in St. Paul on a ten-round newspaper decision. According to the "Decatur Daily Review", Miske took five rounds, Brennan two, and three were even. There was no dishonor in losing to a boxer as exceptional as Billy Miske. Miske, who also faced Dempsey in his career.
Bouts with Jack Dempsey, 1918–1920.
Brennan first lost to Jack Dempsey in a non-title fight on February 25, 1918, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in a sixth-round technical knockout. He was down five times in the bout, suffering at the hands of Dempsey. Four of the knockdowns came in the second round. Brennan in his last knockdown fell with such force to the canvas that he twisted his leg and broke an ankle. He tried to rise, but the referee stopped the bout to prevent a knockout of Brennan.
Heavyweight championship bout with Dempsey, December 1920.
Appearing to be in better condition than he was in their first meeting, for the first nine rounds of the Dempsey title fight on December 14, 1920, in boxing's greatest venue, Madison Square Garden, Brennan held his own against the Champion. He even stunned Dempsey with a right uppercut to the jaw in the second round. Finally in the twelfth round, however, Brennan was doubled over by a right hook below the heart, and then floored by a subsequent left hook to his right side. Dempsey was never one to miss an opportunity to finish an opponent, and the left hook that put Brennan down for the count was the best punch in his arsenal. The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" wrote that Dempsey "was forced to his utmost to hold off a courageous, determined fighter who gave almost as good as he received." Dempsey's most noticeable injuries were a split left ear and a lighter blow to the mouth which both bled at times during the bout. Famed sportswriter Grantland Rice wrote that Dempsey's ear looked like "a cross between a veal cutlet and a bloodly sponge", as Brennan had targeted it in the fight. The challenger received around $35,000 for the bout, though Dempsey took home substantially more. More fans would have attended the bout had they known the fight would last twelve rounds, and that Brennan would hold off Dempsey as long as he did. One source noted that Dempsey was "Brennan's master in every stage". However, the "New York Times" reminded their audience the bout was "one of the most vicious and closely-contested fights in history." and it occurred before a sellout crowd of nearly 17,000
On February 18, 1921, Brennan defeated Bob Martin in a fifteen-round points decision at Madison Square Garden. Taking the lead after the more evenly paced first eight rounds, Brennan used his left repeatedly to Martin's face, and gained an advantage in the last seven rounds, particularly the twelfth through fifteenth. Brennan was an American Expeditionary Forces Champion and Ohio State Heavyweight Champion. There were no knockdowns in the bout which some critics considered tame. On July 4, 1922, he fought a twelve-round, no-decision bout with Martin in Ashland, Kentucky. Brennan showed greater speed than Martin, and had an advantage throughout the bout.
On March 31, 1921, a few sources have Brennan losing to talented Black boxer Jeff Clark in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Clark would fight some of the greatest Black boxers of his era including Kid Norfolk, Sam McVea, Harry Wills, and Sam Langford. Clark had taken the Panamanian Heavyweight Title in Panama City, Panama, defeating Kid Norfolk on May 16, 1915, and had taken the Mexican Heavyweight title earlier.
On May 16, 1922, he knocked out Jim Tracey in an eighth-round TKO at New York's Madison Square Garden. In his career, Tracey would attempt the Mexican Heavyweight Title in July 1923.
Difficult losses to Floyd Johnson and Luis Ángel Firpo, January – March 1923.
On January 12, 1923, he lost decisively to talented heavyweight Floyd Johnson of Iowa in a fifteen-round points decision at Madison Square Garden. Johnson was described as being the aggressor and both out fighting and outboxing Brennan throughout the bout. Brennan, who was a ring weary twenty-nine at the time of the bout, to Johnson's twenty-three was in serious distress in the twelfth and fifteenth rounds. In the twelfth, Brennan received a series of lefts and rights to the head. In the fifteenth, Brennan took a number of additional blows to the head which forced him to clinch at times. Johnson fought several of the most talented boxers of his era including heavyweights Jack Johnson, Jack Renault, Jack Sharkey, and Kid Norfolk. Johnson was said to have exhibited exceptional boxing prowess and form in his win over Brennan. Brennan was so overwhelmed with the attack of Johnson, he was unable to wage an effective offensive against his opponent.
Brennan fought Luis Ángel Firpo only once, on March 12, 1923, at Madison Square Garden, losing badly in an important twelfth-round knockout. He was felled by a right behind the ear, and was treated for a concussion that evening, but considered out of danger. The telling blow to his head was preceded by a flurry of crushing right and left uppercuts from Firpo. Brennan was not released from the hospital till around March 21, and it was intimated at the time that he or his handlers were considering his permanent retirement from the ring. Oddly considering the brutal outcome of the fight, Firpo and Brennan met two weeks later on March 26, and made a short film of their boxing encounter for an Argentine movie company, where the film was widely shown.
His last well publicized bout was with Billy Miske on November 7, 1923. Brennan was reportedly out of shape and looking somewhat heavy. He was staggered by a left to the mouth from Miske in the third round and subsequently knocked down. In the fourth, a hard right to the jaw put Brennan down for the count. It is quite reasonable to assume he should have retired after the injuries he sustained from the Firpo fight eight months earlier.
Early death by gang shooting in 1924.
On June 15, 1924, Brennan was shot to death by two "street thugs" in New York City. After Brennan opened a bar, Club Tia Juana, on 171st Street in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, some rough looking men informed him that he was buying the wrong mob's beer. Brennan threw them out of his bar. He was later summoned outside by another man with whom he was unfamiliar and a gunman standing nearby pulled his gun, and shot him twice. James Cullen, a state trooper who had been chatting with Brennan earlier inside the club, was near Brennan at the time of the shooting and was shot as well. Both assailants were found to have police records, and one had connections to a gang. Three other men were present near the gunman, and suspected of being involved in the incident and also having connections to the "Hell's Kitchen" gang which had targeted Brennan. A few years prior to the shooting, Brennan had purchased the club with the winnings from his second Dempsey fight.
Survived by a wife and child, he was only 30 years old at the time of his death. On June 18, after 5,000 attended his Memorial service at New York's St. Rose de Lima Catholic Church, his funeral was held.

<doc id="6949186" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6949186" title="Alderbrook (horse)">
Alderbrook (horse)

Alderbrook (27 April 1989 – 31 October 2007) was an entire horse who won the Champion Hurdle in 1995 and was runner up in 1996. He was the top rated Hurdler by Timeform in both 1995 and 1996 in their publication, Chasers &amp; Hurdlers.
Background.
Alderbrook's sire was Ardross, a well-known staying horse from the late 1970s, and his dam was Twine. Alderbrook was the highest rated horse on the flat out of Twine.
Alderbrook, foaled on 27 April 1989, was the third foal from his dam.
Racing career.
Early career.
Sally Hall was Alderbrook's first trainer. His racing career did not start until he was three years old. It took him until his 5th start to register a win, and he did this off a lowly handicap mark of 58 in a Class 6 handicap at Goodwood. He won one more race for Sally Hall before he was sent Novice Hurdling (he finished unplaced in a Novice Hurdle at Newcastle).
During the winter, Alderbrook was sold to Ernie Pick. Pick sent him to Kim Bailey, who had achieved success in the National Hunt game with such horses as Mr Frisk (winner of the 1990 Grand National). Success was immediate, with Alderbrook winning his next 4 handicaps in a row, his handicap mark rising to 93 in the process. Alderbrook showed a particular liking for soft ground, something which remained true throughout his career.
Following another winter's break, Alderbrook returned aged 5 with another win in a Conditions race in 1994. Subsequent to this, his sights were raised to Listed, Group 3 and Group 2 level on the flat, with Alderbrook winning the Group 2 Prix Dollar at Longchamp in October 1994 upon his favoured soft ground. In all, Alderbrook had won 11 races on the flat all around the distance of ten furlongs.
Championship.
Following this successful season on the flat, Alderbrook's sights transferred to the jumps scene, but his progress on the flat, together with his breeding.
Although Alderbrook's first attempt at jump racing had ended in failure a couple of years earlier, Kim Bailey had high hopes for his charge. Bailey entered the now six-year-old in the Grade 2 Kingwell Hurdle at Wincanton. On the morning of the race, Alderbrook's odds for the Champion Hurdle were slashed from 50/1 into as short as 20/1 before he had even raced at Wincanton. Racing at such a high level is rare for a Novice. Generally they would compete against other Novices, but Alderbrook was racing against experienced horses in a race only one grade below Championship level.
The race itself bore out the confidence of Bailey. In the hands of stable jockey Norman Williamson, Alderbrook travelled easily in the race and won by 8 lengths. Such was the manner of his success that David Gandolfo, the trainer of the runner-up Trying Again, stated he would not re-oppose Alderbrook at the Cheltenham Festival as he could not foresee his horse reversing the form against a horse likely to improve for the run. Alderbrook started the Champion Hurdle at 11/2 behind the consistent Large Action and Irish punter favourite Danoli. Also opposing were two talented but injury-prone horses, Fortune and Fame and dual Cheltenham Festival winner Montelado, as well as the front-running Triumph Hurdle-winning mare Mysilv. Norman Williamson rode a waiting race, holding Alderbrook up at the back of the field and gradually working his way into contention 2 flights out. As they came around the turn, Alderbrook was still hard on the bridle, which prompted commentator Graham Goode to state that "Alderbrook the Novice is absolutely cruising". Alderbrook jumped the last just behind Danoli and Large Action but quickened clear up the hill to win by 5 lengths. Given the ease of his win, the high quality of his opponents and the likelihood of further improvement due to his comparative inexperience with hurdling, Alderbrook was installed as a short-price favourite to follow up in 1996.
Just over two weeks after winning the Champion Hurdle, Alderbrook was back in action on the flat. Due to his requirement for soft ground and potential easier opposition, he was sent overseas for his three flat races in 1995. He started off with a 7th-place finish in the Group 2 Prix d'Harcourt at Longchamp but then improved on this considerably with arguably his best flat performance in finishing second in the Group 1 Prix Ganay, again at Longchamp.
Alderbrook's final race on the flat was a 2nd-place finish in the Grosser Preis der Wirtschaft (Group 2) at Baden Baden in Germany. This form was boosted when the winner of the race, Freedom Cry, finished the season with a 2nd in one of Europe's top middle-distance races, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe (Group 1), only beaten by the unbeaten Epsom Derby winner - Lammtarra. During his time on the flat, Alderbrook was transferred to Julie Cecil. Bailey was not entirely pleased with the transfer, but continued to train Alderbrook over hurdles.
On the flat, Alderbrook was ridden on 20 occasions by Paul Eddery (brother of the better-known Champion Jockey Pat Eddery). Other jockeys who rode him on the flat were Tony Clark, George Duffield, Nicky Carlisle and John Carroll.
Later career.
During the previous jumps season, Kim Bailey had split with his stable jockey Norman Williamson. Alderbrook therefore needed a new jockey, and Graham Bradley was chosen as the replacement. However, Bradley was late for a schooling session one morning (due to an alarm clock not going off), and Bailey replaced him before a competitive ride. The ride therefore went to the then-Champion Jockey, Richard Dunwoody.
Alderbrook had continued to suffer leg and feet problems and was proving difficult for Bailey to keep sound. He returned to hurdles in February 1996 in a Class B Hurdle at Kempton. Starting at a shade of odds on (10/11), he won despite it being his first race in more than eight months.
Alderbrook was the clear favourite at 10/11 for the 1996 Champion Hurdle and strongly expected to retain his title against a field thought to be inferior to that of 1995. The weather in the days leading up to the race was very wet, and the race took place on ground officially good to soft, but considered softer. Graham Bradley had been given an alternative ride in the race by Jim Old, on Collier Bay. Bradley kept Collier Bay up with a comparatively slow pace and started to race for home 2 flights from the finish. Alderbrook was instead held up at the back of the field and started to try to make up ground approaching 2 flights out. He kept on after Collier Bay for the remainder of the race, but could get no nearer than the 2½ lengths he was beaten at the line. Some commentators thought Dunwoody had given Alderbrook too much ground to make up on soft ground, but Dunwoody was adamant that he had ridden a good race.
Dunwoody kept the ride in what transpired to be Alderbrook's last ever race. Conceding 9 lbs and upwards to the entire field, Alderbrook started as the 8/11 favourite in the Scottish Champion Hurdle (a Grade 2 Handicap Hurdle at Ayr). He won, and this victory afforded him the top-rated hurdling performance by Timeform. During 1996, it was announced that Alderbrook could no longer be kept sound for racing and he was retired. The retirement was discussed on Channel 4's The Morning Line. Jim McGrath was asked how good he thought Alderbrook had been. He replied that the most important point was his high quality despite having serious injury problems. McGrath said he'd visited the stable a month or so before the 1996 Champion Hurdle and that the horse was 'crippled dead' yet went on to finish second.
Retirement and stud career.
Alderbrook was sent to stud at Cobhall Court Stud in Hereford. It was queried as to whether he would be viewed as a commercial sire due to the jumps career he was now more famous for. However, due to his sire's success as a dual-purpose (siring horses good on both the flat and over jumps) sire, Alderbrook had some success. It was announced in 1999 that he would be transferred to Anngrove Stud in Co Laois, Ireland from 2000. The quality of mares sent to Alderbrook was varied and not generally of high quality, but he did sire some jumps horses of note. These include Ollie Magern (winner of the Grade 1 Feltham Novices' Chase and dual winner of the Grade 2 Charlie Hall Chase), Baron Windrush (winner of the Grade 3 Classic Chase) and Sh Boom (winner of the Grade 2 Stayers Hurdle at Haydock).
Alderbrook died at the age of 18 on 31 October 2007 after undergoing an operation on a leg infection. He spent the last years of his life as a breeding stallion in Anngrove Stud Farm, Mountmellick, County Laois.

Childlessness

Childlessness is the state of not having children. Childlessness may have personal, social or political significance.
Childlessness, which may be by choice or circumstance, is distinguished from voluntary childlessness, also called being "childfree", which is voluntarily having no children, and from antinatalism, wherein childlessness is promoted.
Types.
Voluntary.
Personal choice, that is, having the physical, mental, and financial capability to have children but choosing not to (that is, voluntary childlessness), also called being "childfree".
Involuntary.
Infertility, the inability of a person or persons to conceive, due to complications related to either or both a woman or a man. This is regarded as the most prominent reason for involuntary childlessness. Biological causes of infertility vary because many organs of both sexes must function properly for conception to take place. Infertility also affects people who are unable to conceive a second or subsequent pregnancy. This is called secondary infertility.
Types of involuntary childlessness can be classified into several categories:
Obstetric or gynaecological problems, including physical injury caused by a previous pregnancy.
Mental-health difficulties, such as impairment of executive functioning, that prevent a would-be parent from being able to properly raise a child.
Chronic illness/disability: Many serious chronic health conditions put the health of the mother and baby at undue risk if she were to become pregnant. These women are advised not to become pregnant. Some chronic health issues/disabilities obviate a parent from being able to care for a child.
Practical difficulties involving features of one's environment:
Unwillingness of one's partner, where existent, to conceive or raise children (includes partners who are unwilling to adopt children despite being biologically infertile, of the same biological sex, or physically absent).
The death of all of a person's already-conceived children either before birth (as with miscarriage and stillbirth) or after birth (as with infant and child mortality) coupled with a person's not having yet had other children for reasons ranging from physical or emotional exhaustion to having passed childbearing age. Infant and child death can happen for any number of reasons, usually medical or environmental, such as biological malformations, maternal complications, accident or other injury, and disease. Both the existence of many of these causes and the severity of their harm when present can be mitigated by ensuring that the infant's or child's environment features resources ranging from parenting and safety information to pre-, peri-, and postnatal medical care for mother and child.
Statistics in the United States.
The analysis of the three broad categories of childlessness (natural sterility, social sterility, voluntary childlessness) outlined above helps to understand how it has changed over the last century in the United States. At the end of the 19th century, income and education levels were low. This made levels of social sterility very high. In addition to the causes mentioned above, the Spanish Influenza epidemics meant that pregnant women who were infected were particularly vulnerable to miscarriages. The Great Depression also impoverished these generations, for whom voluntary childlessness was almost absent. On the whole, the rates of childlessness for married women born between 1871 and 1915 fluctuated between 15 and 20 percent. The rise in both education and overall income allowed subsequent generations to escape from situations where couples were “constrained” from having children, and rates of childlessness began to fall. Over time, the nature of childlessness changed, becoming more and more the chosen outcome of some educated women. A low level of childlessness of 7% was achieved by the generation of the baby boom. It started to rise again for the subsequent generations, with 12 percent of women born in 1964-68 remaining childless. 
From 2007 to 2011, the fertility rate in the U.S. declined 9%, the Pew Research Center reporting in 2010 that the birth rate was the lowest in U.S. history and that childlessness rose across all racial and ethnic groups to about 1 in 5 versus 1 in 10 in the 1970s. The CDC released statistics in the first quarter of 2016 confirming that the U.S. fertility rate had fallen to its lowest point since record keeping started in 1909: 59.8 births per 1,000 women, half its high of 122.9 in 1957. Even taking the falling fertility rate into account, the U.S. Census Bureau still projected that the U.S. population would increase from 319 million (2014) to 400 million by 2051.
Statistics in Europe.
In a paper presented at a 2013 United Nations Economic Commission for Europe work session on Demographic Projections, Swedish statisticians reported that since the 2000s, childlessness had decreased in Sweden and marriages had increased. It had also become more common for couples to have a third child suggesting that the nuclear family was no longer in decline in Sweden.
The number of people over 50 in the UK without adult children in 2023 was reported to be 20 percent. 
Solutions for involuntary childlessness.
Medical interventions may be available to some individuals or couples to treat involuntary childlessness. Some options include artificial insemination, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and in vitro fertilization. Artificial insemination is the process in which sperm is collected via masturbation and inserted into the uterus immediately after ovulation. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection is a more recent technique that involves injecting a single sperm directly into an egg, the egg is then placed in the uterus by in vitro fertilization. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the process in which a mature ovum is surgically removed from a women's ovary, placed in a medium with sperm until fertilization occurs and then placed in the women's uterus. About 50,000 babies in the United States are conceived this way and are sometimes referred to as "test-tube babies." Other forms of assisted reproductive technology include, gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT). 
Fertility drugs also may improve the chances of conception in women.
For those facing social infertility (such as single individuals or same-sex couples) as well as heterosexual couples with medical infertility, other options include surrogacy and adoption. Surrogacy, in this case a surrogate mother, is the process in which a woman becomes pregnant (usually by artificial insemination or surgical implantation of a fertilized egg) for the purpose of carrying the fetus to term for another individual or couple. Another option may be adoption; to adopt is to take voluntarily (a child of other parents) as one's own child.
Contraception.
All forms of contraception have played a role in voluntary childlessness over time, but the invention of reliable oral contraception contributed profoundly to changes in societal ideas and norms. Voluntary childlessness, resulting from contraception has influenced women's health, laws and policies, interpersonal relationships, feminist issues, and sexual practices among adults and adolescents.
The availability of oral contraception during the late 1900s was directly related to the women's rights movement by establishing, for the first time, a mass distribution of a way to control fertility. The so-called "pill" gave women the opportunity to make different life choices they may not previously have been able to make, such as for example, furthering their career. This led to monumental changes in the current gender and family roles.
Margaret Sanger, an activist in 1914, was an important figure during the reproductive rights movement. She coined the term "birth control" and opened the first birth control clinic in the U.S. Sanger collaborated with many others to make the first oral contraception possible, these persons include: Gregory Pincus, John Rock, Frank Colton, and Katherine McCormick. The pill was approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for contraceptive use in the year 1960 and although it was controversial, it remained the most popular form of birth control in the U.S. until 1967 when there was a rise in publicity about the possible health risks associated with the pill; consequently sales dropped twenty-four percent. In the year 1988 the original high-dose pill was taken off the market and replaced with a low-dose pill that was considered to have less risks and some health benefits.
Impacts.
Personal.
Before conception was well understood, childlessness was usually blamed on the woman and this in itself added to the high level of negative emotional and social effects of childlessness. “Some wealthy families also adopted children, as a means of providing heirs in cases of childlessness or where no sons had been born.” The monetary incentives offered by Westerners' desire for children is so strong that a commercial market in child laundering exists.
Psychological.
People trying to cope with involuntary childlessness may experience symptoms of distress that are similar to those experienced by bereaved people, such as health problems, anxiety and depression.
Political.
Specific instances of childlessness, especially in cases of royal succession, but more generally for people in positions of power or influence, have had enormous impacts on politics, culture and society. In many cases, a lack of a male child was also considered a type of childlessness, since male children were needed as heirs to property and titles. Examples of historical impacts of actual or potential childlessness include:
Social.
Socially, childlessness has also resulted in financial stress and sometimes ruin in societies which depend on their offspring to contribute economically and to support other members of the family or tribe. “In agricultural societies about 20 per cent of all couples would not have children because of problems for at least one of the partners. Worry about assuring the desired birth rate could become an important part of family life … even after a first child was born. … In agricultural societies up to half of all children born would die within two years … (Excess surviving children could among other things, be sent to childless families to provide labour there, reducing upkeep demands at home.) When a population disaster hit – like war or major disease – higher birth rates might briefly be feasible to fill out community ranks.”
In the 20th and 21st centuries, when control over conception became reliable in some countries, childlessness is having an enormous impact on national planning and financial planning. In societies where child-bearing is a sign of a high libido, childlessness may be viewed as a sign of low libido. They may also be disparaged with terms like "genetic dead end".
In some countries, even those with state health and social care services, children often support elderly family members either by becoming their full or part time carers, or by, for example, accompanying them to medical appointments, helping with cleaning and shopping, taking care of intimate personal care tasks or by looking after their finances. If national health and care services dwindle due to decreased funding or lack of staff, and if the numbers of people without children nearby increase, the statistics for those left without help and support as they age, are set to soar. The UK charity, Ageing Without Children, set up in 2012, advocates for those without support from children or others in the future generation. 
Stigma.
In a society that encourages and promotes parenthood, with its current social norms and culture, childlessness can be stigmatizing. Pronatalism, the idea couples should reproduce and want to reproduce remains widespread in North America, contrary to most European cultures. Women in Australia, and both men and women in the UK have reported facing stigma and social exclusion because of their childlessness.
Childlessness may be considered deviant behavior in marriage and this may lead to adverse effects on the relationship of the couple, as well as their individual identities when pertaining to the lack of children being involuntary. For persons that consider that becoming parents was a critical process of their adult family life, a "transition" as Rossi deems it must take place. This transition is from the anticipated parenthood to an unwanted status of non-parenthood. Such a transition may require the individual to readjust their perspective of self or relationship role with their significant other.

Stian Ohr (born 4 January 1978) is a former Norwegian footballer who played as a midfielder for several clubs in Tippeligaen. He was also capped once for Norway in 2006. While playing for Molde, Start, Vålerenga, Stabæk and Strømsgodset, he played a total of 239 matches and scored 27 goals in Tippeligaen. He also spent time on loan with Hødd and ended his career with the First Division side Mjøndalen.
Club career.

He also won the Norwegian Youth Cup with Molde in 1996 and 1997.
Ohr made his break-through ahead of the 1997 season, at same time as the other local youngsters, Thomas Mork and Anders Hasselgård, and the trio got the nickname "". Ohr didn't play much for Molde in the 1999 season, and spent most of the season with Hødd which was relegated from the First Division. After the season, Molde decided to terminate Ohr's contract. He subsequently joined Start in 2000, and was a part of the team that was relegated from Tippeligaen. Ohr scored 14 goals in 53 matches for Start between 2000 and 2001, before he was sold to Vålerenga. In his first season with the club, he became Norwegian Champion after they won the 2002 Norwegian Football Cup.

Cliff Dapper

Clifford Roland Dapper (January 2, 1920 – February 8, 2011) was an American Major League Baseball catcher who played for the Brooklyn Dodgers during the 1942 season. Listed at , , he batted and threw right-handed.
Born in Los Angeles, Dapper began his baseball career at age 18 for the Class-B Bellingham Chinooks in the Western International League. With many players unavailable due to World War II, Dapper got his shot at the majors in April 1942, appearing in eight games for Brooklyn. He recorded eight hits in 17 at-bats for a .471 batting average, including a home run, one double, two runs and nine RBI. Despite his hot hitting, Dapper was unable to dislodge all-star Mickey Owen from the catcher's position for the Dodgers, and he was returned to the minors. Later that season he was drafted into the US Navy, and missed the 1943–45 seasons while serving in the South Pacific during World War II.
Following his military discharge, Dapper returned to baseball as a player and then manager, helming Pittsburgh Pirates farm clubs in Eugene, Oregon, and Billings, Montana, all while still an active player. He eventually played 1,623 minor-league games over a twenty-year span, hitting .274 and 102 homers before retiring in 1957, the same year that his former team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, moved to his home town of Los Angeles.
Traded for Ernie Harwell.
Dapper held the unique distinction of having been traded for an announcer. In 1948, Dapper, then with the Dodgers' top farm club, the Class-AAA Montreal Royals of the International League, was sent to the then-unaffiliated Class AA Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association—the Dodgers' GM Branch Rickey wanted Ernie Harwell to substitute for ailing Dodger broadcaster Red Barber, and the Crackers' president Earl Mann wanted a player in return. Dapper batted .280 in 115 games and managed the Crackers in 1949.
While Dapper returned to the Dodgers organization the following year, playing for another Brooklyn-affiliated AAA team—the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League—in 1950, Harwell left the Dodgers after the 1949 season, broadcasting the New York Giants and Baltimore Orioles through the 1950s before spending the next 42 years with the Detroit Tigers. Harwell and Dapper would not meet for over half a century, until Dapper came to Comerica Park on September 15, 2002, when Harwell's statue at the Tigers' home was unveiled.
After baseball.
Following his baseball career, Dapper settled in Fallbrook, California, buying a ranch alongside former Dodgers teammate Duke Snider where they made a substantial living farming avocados and lemons on 60 acres. Dapper became president of the California Avocado Growers Council.
Dapper and his wife Stanna (), who had been high school classmates and married in 1944, raised three sons—all catchers—and a daughter in Fallbrook. Stanna died in 2008, after which Dapper moved to an assisted living facility in Fallbrook, where he died at the age of 91 in 2011. Dapper and his wife are buried together at Riverside National Cemetery.

A7 is a motorway (freeway) in Portugal. It connects Póvoa de Varzim to Vila Pouca de Aguiar, its main purpose was to give a fast access to the shoreline by inland cities, such as Guimarães and Vila Nova de Famalicão, thus a toll is applied.
Construction of this motorway started in 2001 and known as "EIA - A7/IC5 - Lanço Póvoa de Varzim/ Famalicão" which affected three archaeological sites, two of which protohistoric: Castro de Argivai in Póvoa de Varzim (a probable protohistoric farmhouse), the surrounding archeological area of Cividade de Bagunte (a protohistoric city) and Quinta dos Cavaleiros (a villa related to Nuno Álvares Pereira and in the dominium of the counts of Cavaleiros), both of the later in Vila do Conde's countryside. Possible existence of prehistoric tumuli were surveyed but delivered no results. One of the most affected sites was "Castro de Argivai".

<doc id="6949283" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6949283" title="Xysma">
Xysma

Xysma is a Finnish rock &amp; early metal band that was founded in 1988 in Naantali, a small town near Turku. The band split up in 1998, but reunited in 2006 for a memorial gig, and reunited again in 2011.
History.
Formation and early years.
In the beginning Xysma played grindcore and death metal. The band played at the Turku underground center "Panimo", and created an intense yet short-lived scene. Soon after, the death metal/grindcore influence spread to the Helsinki area, with bands such as Abhorrence (which soon evolved into the melodic death metal band Amorphis).
Xysma's first demo, "Swarming of the Maggots", was widely distributed via tape trading and became a cult classic (it was remastered and released in the 2004 Xysma compilation CD). The band’s music was inspired by the early pioneers of the genre like Carcass and Napalm Death. With the following mini-albums, "Above the Mind of Morbidity" and "Fata Morgana", the latter being released in the United States with the famous Seraphic Decay label, Xysma evolved towards less extreme metal.
"Yeah" and "First &amp; Magical".
Since Xysma was a part of the rise of Scandinavian death metal, they had close bonds to the scene in Stockholm, Sweden, occasionally travelling to and playing in Stockholm, and visiting their colleagues from Entombed and others. Xysma also recorded their first album, "Yeah" (1991), in Sweden, in the Sunlight Studios of producer Tomas Skogsberg.
"Yeah" mixed death metal and Black Sabbath structures in a complex fashion. Their second album, "First &amp; Magical" (1992), revealed more changes and more musical evolution, featuring something akin to death'n'roll.
"Deluxe", "Lotto" and "Girl on the Beach".
Xysma's third album, "Deluxe" (1993), continued to evolve their death'n'roll sound, with the instrumentals becoming more rock-like. The songs were hard-paced, in the vein of Helmet. This was the last album on which Janitor used growled vocals. The next album, "Lotto" (1996), was a full-blooded rock album with a very retro style; one of the tracks was featured later in Brian De Palma's movie Snake Eyes (1998). The band also released an EP called "Singles", containing covers of classics sung in a schlager style.
Xysma's fifth and final album, "Girl on the Beach", was more or less a pop rock album, and tension between the members grew. Eventually the band decided to quit, and though they played occasional gigs since, there had been no talk of reunion.
Reunions and "No Place Like Alone".
Guitarist Toni Stranius (9-6-1972 – 7-7-2006), member of both Xysma and Disgrace, died in 2006 after a heart attack, in Ireland, where he lived. A memorial gig in his honour was held on 15 September 2006 in Bar Päiväkoti, Turku. All of Stranius' bands (including Disgrace, Xysma and Finnish rock band Kalsaripaita) played at the occasion, reuniting Xysma just for this special event.
Xysma has been playing live concerts again since 2011.
On 3 February 2023, the band released a new single "Sigh for Sore Mind". Their sixth album, "No Place Like Alone", was released on 24 March. It is the band's first album in 25 years.

JY15

The JY15 is an American one-design centerboard dinghy designed by Rod Johnstone in 1989.
Production.
The boat was built by JY Sailboats and then by Hunter Marine in the United States. The design was acquired by Nickels Boats Works and built from 2011. Nickels merged with WindRider LLC of Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2015 and production continued, but had ended by 2020.
Design.
The JY15 is a recreational, planing hull, sailing dinghy, built predominantly of Advanced Composite Process (ACP) by JY Sailboats and Hunter and later from fiberglass by Nickels and WindRider. It has a fractional sloop, a raked stem, a vertical transom, a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller with an extension and a folding centerboard. It displaces .
The boat has a draft of with the centreboard extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer.
The stays have lever adjusters for rapid set-up and the mast disassembles for ease of ground transport. The mainsheet is a 2:1 and is led off to the centerboard trunk. The rudder swings up for launching and recovering in shallow water. The design is optimized for crew hiking out, with hiking straps and rounded deck and hull for comfort.
The Hunter-production JY-15 was made out of ACP (Advanced Composite Process). ACP is a laminate consisting of a foam core, an inner fiberglass skin, and a 1/8" outer plastic skin. When the design was acquired by Nickels it was rendered in fiberglass.
Operational history.
The JY15 is sailed in over 80 fleets in the US.

Prix Jean de Chaudenay

The Prix Jean de Chaudenay was a Group 2 flat horse race in France open to thoroughbreds aged four years or older. It was run at Saint-Cloud over a distance of 2,400 metres (about 1½ miles), and it was scheduled to take place each year in May or June.
History.
The event was established in 1920, and it was originally called the Grand Prix du Printemps. It was held on the French public holiday of Lundi de Pentecôte. It was initially open to horses aged three or older, and run over 2,600 metres. It was cut to 2,500 metres in 1923, and to 2,400 metres in 1929.
The race was renamed in memory of Jean de Chaudenay (1870–1967), a former president of the Société Sportive d'Encouragement, in the late 1960s. It was abandoned due to student protests in 1968, and first run with its new title in 1969.
The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Prix Jean de Chaudenay was classed at Group 2 level.
The race was closed to three-year-olds in 1994. It was contested at Deauville over 2,500 metres in 1996. It was last run in 2003.
Another event, the Prix Hubert de Chaudenay, became known as the Prix Chaudenay in 2004. It now honours both father and son, Jean and Hubert de Chaudenay.

List of NHS regional hospital boards (1947–1974)

Regional hospital boards (RHBs) were established in 1947 by the National Health Service Act 1946 to administer hospital and specialist services of the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales. Each board was responsible for a number of hospital management committees (HMCs), and each region was associated with a university running a school of medicine.
The National Health Service Reorganisation Act 1973 replaced the hospital boards with regional health authorities and area health authorities in 1974.
The membership of each board would usually include one or more doctors from the region, a senior nurse or dentist, and elected members of the relevant local authorities, as well as a usually at least one trades union member. The RHB was responsible for appointing the members of each HMC it was responsible for, as well as professional advisory committees on matters pertinent to the work of the board. 
List of NHS Regional Hospital Boards in England, 1947-1974.
Each board administered a regional hospital area, which was defined in terms of local government units: administrative counties, county boroughs, metropolitan boroughs, urban districts and rural districts.
In 1965 a new Wessex Regional Hospital Area was formed from the western part of the South-West Metropolitan Hospital Area:
At the same time the Welsh Regional Hospital Area was redesignated as the Welsh Hospital Area, and the Regional Hospital Board became the Welsh Hospital Board.

<doc id="6949349" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6949349" title="Uchida Kuichi">
Uchida Kuichi

 was a pioneering Japanese photographer from Nagasaki. He was greatly respected as a portrait photographer and was the only photographer granted a sitting to photograph the Emperor Meiji.
Uchida was adopted at the age of 13, following his father's death, by the physician Matsumoto Jun (formerly Matsumoto Ryōjun) (1832–1907), who was at that time studying photography with J. L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort (1829–1908).
Uchida studied photography under Ueno Hikoma in their native city of Nagasaki. When he was 16 years old, he purchased his first photographic equipment and by 1863, when he was 19, he was importing and selling photographic equipment. He opened his first photographic studio in 1865 with Morita Raizō in Osaka, the first studio in that city.
In 1866 Uchida moved his studio to Bashamichi in Yokohama, then in 1869 moved the studio again, this time to the district of Asakusa in Tokyo. He soon became known as the best portrait photographer in Tokyo.
Having achieved this reputation for excellence, Uchida Kuichi was the only photographer granted a sitting by the Emperor Meiji, who was considered a living deity and rarely seen in public. The portrait session took place in 1872 on a commission by the Imperial Household Ministry to photograph the Emperor and Empress Haruko in full court dress and everyday robes. In 1873, Uchida again photographed the Emperor, who this time wore military dress, and a photograph from this sitting became the official imperial portrait. Copies of the official portrait were distributed among foreign heads of state and Japanese regional governmental offices and schools, but their private sale was prohibited. Nevertheless, many copies of the photograph were made and circulated on the market. The emperor was not photographed again until 1888 or 1889.
In 1872 Uchida was commissioned to accompany the emperor on a tour through central Japan and Kyūshū, and to take photographs of the people and places during the journey. He was not permitted to photograph the emperor, however.
Uchida was very successful commercially and his life was even the subject of a kabuki play written and performed in 1870.
He died in 1875 of tuberculosis.

History of spaceflight

Spaceflight began in the 20th century following theoretical and practical breakthroughs by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert H. Goddard, and Hermann Oberth, each of whom published works proposing rockets as the means for spaceflight. The first successful large-scale rocket programs were initiated in Nazi Germany by Wernher von Braun. The Soviet Union took the lead in the post-war Space Race, launching the first satellite, the first animal, the first human and the first woman into orbit. The United States landed the first men on the Moon in 1969. Through the late 20th century, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, and China were also working on projects to reach space.
Following the end of the Space Race, spaceflight has been characterized by greater international cooperation, cheaper access to low Earth orbit and an expansion of commercial ventures. Interplanetary probes have visited all of the planets in the Solar System, and humans have remained in orbit for long periods aboard space stations such as "Mir" and the ISS. Most recently, China has emerged as the third nation with the capability to launch independent crewed missions, while operators in the commercial sector have developed reusable booster systems and craft launched from airborne platforms. In 2020, SpaceX became the first commercial operator to successfully launch a crewed mission to the International Space Station with Crew Dragon Demo-2.
Background.
At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a burst of scientific investigation into interplanetary travel, inspired by fiction by writers such as Jules Verne ("From the Earth to the Moon", "Around the Moon") and H.G. Wells ("The First Men in the Moon", "The War of the Worlds").
The first realistic proposal for spaceflight was "Issledovanie Mirovikh Prostranstv Reaktivnimi Priborami", or "The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices" by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, published in 1903.
Spaceflight became an engineering possibility with the work of Robert H. Goddard's publication in 1919 of his paper "A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes", where his application of the de Laval nozzle to liquid fuel rockets gave sufficient power for interplanetary travel to become possible. This paper was highly influential on Hermann Oberth and Wernher von Braun, later key players in spaceflight.
In 1929, the Slovene officer Hermann Noordung was the first to imagine a complete space station in his book "The Problem of Space Travel".
The first rocket to reach space was the German V-2 rocket MW 18014, on a vertical test flight in June 1944. After the war ended, the research and development branch of the (British) Ordinance Office organised "Operation Backfire" which, in October 1945, assembled enough V-2 missiles and supporting components to enable the launch of three (possibly four, depending on source consulted) of them from a site near Cuxhaven in northern Germany. Although these launches were inclined and the rockets did not achieve the altitude necessary to be regarded as sub-orbital spaceflight, the Backfire report remains the most extensive technical documentation of the rocket, including all support procedures, tailored vehicles and fuel composition.
Subsequently, the British Interplanetary Society proposed an enlarged man-carrying version of the V-2 called "Megaroc". The plan, written in 1946, envisaged a three-year development programme culminating in the launch of test pilot Eric Brown on a sub-orbital mission in 1949.
The decision by the Ministry of Supply under Attlee's government to concentrate on research into nuclear power generation and sub-sonic passenger jet aircraft over supersonic atmospheric flight and spaceflight delayed the introduction of both of the latter, although only by a year in the case of supersonic flight, as the data from the Miles M.52 was handed to Bell Aircraft.
In 1947, the US sent the first animals in space, fruit flies, although not into orbit, through a V-2 rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. On June 14, 1949, the US launched the first mammal into space, a rhesus macaque monkey named Albert II, on a sub-orbital flight, though Albert II died when the parachute failed. On July 22, 1951, the Soviets launched the Soviet space dogs, Dezik and Tsygan, who were the first dogs in space and the first to safely return.
Establishment and Space Race.
First artificial satellites.
The race began in 1957 when both the US and the USSR made statements announcing they planned to launch artificial satellites during the 18-month long International Geophysical Year of July 1957 to December 1958. On July 29, 1957, the US announced a planned launch of the Vanguard by the spring of 1958, and on July 31, the USSR announced it would launch a satellite in the fall of 1957.
On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite of Earth in the history of humankind.
On November 3, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the second satellite, Sputnik 2, and the first to carry a living animal into orbit, a dog named Laika. Sputnik 3 was launched on May 15, 1958, and carried a large array of instruments for geophysical research and provided data on pressure and composition of the upper atmosphere, concentration of charged particles, photons in cosmic rays, heavy nuclei in cosmic rays, magnetic and electrostatic fields, and meteoric particles. After a series of failures with the program, the US succeeded with Explorer 1, which became the first US satellite in space, on February 1, 1958. This carried scientific instrumentation and detected the theorized Van Allen radiation belt.
The US public shock over Sputnik 1 became known as the Sputnik crisis. On July 29, 1958, the US Congress passed legislation turning the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with responsibility for the nation's civilian space programs. In 1959, NASA began Project Mercury to launch single-man capsules into Earth orbit and chose a corps of seven astronauts introduced as the "Mercury Seven".
First man in space.
On April 12, 1961, the USSR opened the era of crewed spaceflight, with the flight of the first "cosmonaut" (Russian name for space travelers), Yuri Gagarin. Gagarin's flight, part of the Soviet Vostok space exploration program, took 108 minutes and consisted of a single orbit of the Earth.
On August 7, 1961, Gherman Titov, another Soviet cosmonaut, became the second man in orbit during his Vostok 2 mission. Titov orbited Earth 17 times in over 25 hours during his spaceflight.
By June 16, 1963, the USSR launched a total of six Vostok cosmonauts, two pairs of them flying concurrently, and accumulating a total of 260 cosmonaut-orbits and just over sixteen cosmonaut-days in space.
On May 5, 1961, the US launched its first suborbital Mercury astronaut, Alan Shepard, in the "Freedom 7" capsule.
First woman in space.
The first woman in space was former civilian parachutist Valentina Tereshkova, who entered orbit on June 16, 1963, aboard the Soviet mission Vostok 6. The chief Soviet spacecraft designer, Sergey Korolyov, conceived of the idea to recruit a female cosmonaut corps and launch two women concurrently on Vostok 5/6. However, his plan was changed to launch a male first in Vostok 5, followed shortly afterward by Tereshkova. The then first secretary of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev, spoke to Tereshkova by radio during her flight.
On November 3, 1963, Tereshkova married fellow cosmonaut Andrian Nikolayev, who had previously flown on Vostok 3. On June 8, 1964, she gave birth to the first child conceived by two space travelers. The couple divorced in 1982, and Tereshkova went on to become a prominent member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
The second woman to fly to space was aviator Svetlana Savitskaya, aboard Soyuz T-7 on August 18, 1982.
Competition develops.
Khrushchev pressured Korolyov to quickly produce greater space achievements in competition with the announced Gemini and Apollo plans. Rather than allowing him to develop his plans for a crewed Soyuz spacecraft, he was forced to make modifications to squeeze two or three men into the Vostok capsule, calling the result Voskhod. Only two of these were launched. Voskhod 1 was the first spacecraft with a crew of three, who could not wear space suits because of size and weight constrictions. Alexei Leonov made the first spacewalk when he left the Voskhod 2 on March 8, 1965. He was almost lost in space when he had extreme difficulty fitting his inflated space suit back into the cabin through an airlock, and a landing error forced him and Voskhod 2 crewmate Pavel Belyayev to be lost in dense woods for hours before being found by the recovery crew and rescued days later.
The start of crewed Gemini missions was delayed a year later than NASA had planned, but ten largely successful missions were launched in 1965 and 1966, allowing the US to overtake the Soviet lead by achieving space rendezvous (Gemini 6A) and docking (Gemini 8) of two vehicles, long duration flights of eight days (Gemini 5) and fourteen days (Gemini 7), and demonstrating the use of extra-vehicular activity to do useful work outside a spacecraft (Gemini 12).
The USSR made no crewed flights during this period but continued to develop its Soyuz craft and secretly accepted Kennedy's implicit lunar challenge, designing Soyuz variants for lunar orbit and landing. They also attempted to develop the N1, a large, crewed Moon-capable launch vehicle similar to the US Saturn V.
As both nations rushed to get their new spacecraft flying with men, the intensity of the competition caught up to them in early 1967, when they suffered their first crew fatalities. On January 27, the entire crew of Apollo 1, "Gus" Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee, were killed by suffocation in a fire that swept through their cabin during a ground test approximately one month before their planned launch. On April 24, the single pilot of Soyuz 1, Vladimir Komarov, was killed in a crash when his landing parachutes tangled, after a mission cut short by electrical and control system problems. Both accidents were determined to be caused by design defects in the spacecraft, which were corrected before crewed flights resumed.
Approaches and Landings on Venus.
On February 12, 1961, the Soviet spacecraft "Venera 1" was the first flyby probe launched to another planet. However communications with the probe failed before it could complete its mission. Venera 3, which also lost contact, marked the first time a man-made object made contact with another planet after it impacted Venus on March 1, 1966. Venera 4, Venera 5, and Venera 6 performed successful atmospheric entry.
In 1970 Venera 7 marked the first time a spacecraft was able to return data after landing on another planet. In 1972, Venera 8 landed on Venus and measured the light level as being suitable for surface photography. In 1975, Venera 9 established an orbit around Venus and successfully returned the first photography of the surface of Venus. Venera 10 landed on Venus and followed with further photography shortly after.
In 1981, Venera 13 performed a successful soft-landing on Venus and marked the first probe to drill into the surface of another planet and take a sample. Venera 13 also took an audio sample of the Venusian environment, marking another first.
Venera 13 returned the first color images of the surface of Venus, revealing an orange-brown flat bedrock surface covered with loose regolith and small flat thin angular rocks. The composition of the sample determined by the X-ray fluorescence spectrometer put it in the class of weakly differentiated melanocratic alkaline gabbroids, similar to terrestrial leucitic basalt with a high potassium content. The acoustic detector returned the sounds of the spacecraft operations and the background wind, estimated to be a speed of around 0.5 m/sec wind. Venera 14 followed suit in an identical mission profile.
In total, 10 Venera probes achieved a soft landing on the surface of Venus.
In 1984, the Vega programme began and ended with the launch of two crafts launched 6 days apart, Vega 1 and Vega 2. Both crafts deployed a balloon in addition to a lander, marking a first in spaceflight.
The first successful flyby Venus probe was the American "Mariner 2" spacecraft, which flew past Venus in 1962, coming within 35,000 km. A modified "Ranger" Moon probe, it established that Venus has practically no intrinsic magnetic field and measured the temperature of the planet's atmosphere to be approximately 500 °C (773 K; 932 °F).
Manned Lunar missions.
The US conducted the first crewed spaceflight to leave Earth orbit and orbit the Moon on December 21, 1968, with the Apollo 8 space mission. Later they succeeded in achieving President Kennedy's goal on July 20, 1969, with the landing of Apollo 11. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first men to set foot on the Moon. Six such successful landings were achieved through 1972, with one failure on Apollo 13.
The first three Apollo missions to land astronauts on the Moon, Apollo 11, 12, and 14, did not enable exploration of a large portion of the lunar surface. Apollo 14 featured the longest journey on foot undertaken by the lunar explorers, with Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell bringing a cart called a Modular Equipment Transporter (MET) to help with sampling of moon rocks, but the men did not quite reach their intended destination of the Cone Crater. However, the last three Apollo missions, Apollo 15, 16, and 17, featured the lunar rover, which enabled longer and farther exploration by the astronauts on those flights. The astronauts on the last three Apollo missions drove over 56 miles around the lunar surface using the rovers, and were able to collect 620 pounds of moon rocks, three quarters of the total collected during the Apollo missions. More crewed moon landings were planned, all the way through Apollo 20, but after the loss of public interest following Apollo 11 (which contributed to a shrinking budget for NASA) and the near catastrophe of Apollo 13, three Apollo missions were canceled.
The N1 rocket suffered four catastrophic uncrewed launch failures between 1969 and 1972, and the Soviet government officially discontinued its crewed lunar program on June 24, 1974, when Valentin Glushko succeeded Korolyov as General Spacecraft Designer.
Later phase.
Both nations went on to fly relatively small, non-permanent crewed space laboratories Salyut and Skylab, using their Soyuz and Apollo craft as shuttles. The US launched only one Skylab, but the USSR launched a total of seven "Salyuts", three of which were secretly Almaz military crewed reconnaissance stations, which carried a cannon (possibly to test for potential use in space warfare). Crewed reconnaissance stations were found to be a bad idea since uncrewed satellites could do the job much more cost-effectively. The United States Air Force had planned a crewed reconnaissance station, the Manned Orbital Laboratory, which was cancelled in 1969. The Soviets cancelled Almaz in 1978.
In a season of detente, the two competitors declared an end to the race and literally shook hands on July 17, 1975, with the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, where the two craft docked, and the crews exchanged visits.
Diversification.
The participation of private actors and other countries beside the Soviet Union and the United States in spaceflight had been the case from the very start of spaceflight development. A first commercial satellite had been launched by 1962, as well as in 1965 a third country achieving orbital spaceflight. The very beginning of the space age, the launch of Sputnik, was in the context of international exchange, the International Geophysical Year 1957. Also, soon into the space age the international community came together starting to negotiate dedicated international law governing outer space activity.
In the 1970s the Soviet Union started to invite other countries to fly their people into space through its Intercosmos program and the United States started to include women and people of colour in its astronaut program.
First exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union was formalized in the 1962 Dryden-Blagonravov agreement, calling for cooperation on the exchange of data from weather satellites, a study of the Earth's magnetic field, and joint tracking of the NASA Echo II balloon satellite. In 1963 President Kennedy could even interest premier Khrushchev in a joint crewed Moon landing, but after the assassination of Kennedy in November 1963 and Khrushchev's removal from office in October 1964, the competition between the two nations' crewed space programs heated up, and talk of cooperation became less common, due to tense relations and military implications. Only later the United States and the Soviet Union slowly started to exchange more information and engage in joint programs, particularly in the light of the development of safety standards since 1970, producing the co-developed APAS-75 and later docking standards. Most notably this signaled the ending of the first era of the space age, the Space Race, through the Apollo-Soyuz mission which became the basis for the Shuttle-Mir program and eventually the International Space Station programme.
Such international cooperation, and international spaceflight organization was furthermore fueled by increasingly more countries achieving spaceflight capabilies and together with a by the 1980s established private spaceflight sector, both being embodied by the European Space Agency. This allowed the formation of an international and commercial post-Space Race spaceflight economy and period, with by the 1990s a public perception of space exploration and space-related technologies as being increasingly commonplace.
This increasingly cooperative diversification persisted until competition started to rise in the diversified conditions, from the 2010s and particularly by the early 2020s.
New competition.
Starting in the 2010s the diversified spaceflight sector had become by the 2020s increasingly competitive with returning inter-national competition and cooperation barrieres, like a cooperation ban enacted in the United States on China in 2011 and later the European Space Agency banning Russia, and increased private competition in spaceflight capabilities, enabled by the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015.
Some have called it a "New Space Race" period, particularly in light of China's speedy advances and other Asian countries competing in advancing their spaceflight achievements, creating an "Asian Space Race". Although international cooperation and international private spaceflight remains an integral part of the sector, there is competitively diversifying commercial international contracting, such as international private human spaceflight of e.g. Axiom Space in cooperation with different countries and heavily relying on the International Space Station, which also continued operation despite international confrontations like the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while private spaceflight, with Space-X's Starlink, became a significant element in the war and international politics.
Meanwhile, a range of new lunar spaceflight programs are being advanced especially as international programs, from the Artemis program and the China-Russian plans to establish a lunar base, to the European Space Agency planned Moon Village.
This competitive but international commercial development of the spaceflight sector has been called "New Space".
By programs.
United States.
Until the 21st century, space programs of the United States were exclusively operated by government agencies. In the 21st century, several aerospace companies began efforts at developing a private space industry, with SpaceX being the most successful so far.
NASA.
Project Mercury.
Project Mercury was the first human spaceflight program of the United States, running from 1958 through 1963. Its goal was to put a person into Earth orbit and return them safely, ideally before the Soviet Union. John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth on February 20, 1962, aboard the Mercury-Atlas 6.
Project Gemini.
Project Gemini was NASA's second human spaceflight program. The program ran from 1961 to 1966. The program pioneered the orbital maneuvers required for space rendezvous. Ed White became the first American to make an extravehicular activity (EVA, or "space walk"), on June 3, 1965, during Gemini 4. Gemini 6A and 7 accomplished the first space rendezvous on December 15, 1965. Gemini 8 achieved the first space docking with an uncrewed Agena Target Vehicle on March 16, 1966. Gemini 8 was also the first US spacecraft to experience in-space critical failure endangering the lives of the crew.
Apollo program.
The Apollo program was the third human spaceflight program carried out by NASA. The program's goal was to orbit and land crewed vehicles on the Moon. The program ran from 1969 to 1972. Apollo 8 was the first human spaceflight to leave Earth orbit and orbit the Moon on December 21, 1968. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first men to set foot on the Moon during the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969.
Skylab.
The Skylab program's goal was to create the first space station of NASA. The program marked the last launch of the Saturn V rocket on May 14, 1973. Many experiments were performed on board, including unprecedented solar studies. The longest crewed mission of the program was Skylab 4 which lasted 84 days, from November 16, 1973, to February 8, 1974. The total mission duration was 2249 days, with Skylab finally falling from orbit over Australia on July 11, 1979.
Space Shuttle.
Although its pace slowed, space exploration continued after the end of the Space Race. The United States launched the first reusable spacecraft, the Space Shuttle, on the 20th anniversary of Gagarin's flight, April 12, 1981. On November 15, 1988, the Soviet Union duplicated this with an uncrewed flight of the only "Buran"-class shuttle to fly, its first and only reusable spacecraft. It was never used again after the first flight; instead, the Soviet Union continued to develop space stations using the Soyuz craft as the crew shuttle.
Sally Ride became the first American woman in space in 1983. Eileen Collins was the first female Shuttle pilot, and with Shuttle mission STS-93 in July 1999 she became the first woman to command a US spacecraft.The United States continued missions to the ISS and other goals with the high-cost Shuttle system, which was retired in 2011.
Soviet Union.
Sputnik.
The Sputnik 1 became the first artificial Earth satellite on 4 October 1957. The satellite transmitted a radio signal, but had no sensors otherwise. Studying the Sputnik 1 allowed scientists to calculate the drag from the upper atmosphere by measuring position and speed of the satellite. Sputnik 1 broadcast for 21 days until its batteries depleted on 4 October 1957, and the satellite finally fell from orbit on 4 January 1958.
Luna programme.
The Luna programme was a series of uncrewed robotic satellite launches with the goal of studying the Moon. The program ran from 1959 to 1976 and consisted of 15 successful missions; the program achieved many first achievements and collected data on the Moon's chemical composition, gravity, temperature, and radiation. Luna 2 became the first human-made object to make contact with the Moon's surface in September 1959. Luna 3 returned the first photographs of the far side of the Moon in October 1959.
Vostok.
The Vostok Programme was the first Soviet spaceflight project to put Soviet citizens into low Earth orbit and return them safely. The programme carried out six crewed spaceflights between 1961 and 1963. The program was the first program to put humans into space, with Yuri Gagarin becoming the first man in space on April 12, 1961, aboard the Vostok 1. Gherman Titov became the first person to stay in orbit for a full day on August 7, 1961, aboard the Vostok 2. Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space on June 16, 1963, aboard the Vostok 6.
Voskhod.
The Voskhod programme began in 1964 and consisted of two crewed flights before the program was canceled by the Soyuz programme in 1966. Voskhod 1 launched on October 12, 1964, and was the first crewed spaceflight with a multi-crewed vehicle. Alexei Leonov performed the first spacewalk aboard Voskhod 2 on March 18, 1965.
Salyut.
The Salyut programme was the first space station program undertaken by the Soviet Union. The goal was to carry out long-term research into the problems of living in space and a variety of astronomical, biological and Earth-resources experiments. The program ran from 1971 to 1986. Salyut 1, the first station in the program, became the world's first crewed space station.
Soyuz programme.
The Soyuz programme was initiated by the soviet space program in the 1960s and continues as the responsibility of roscosmos to this day. The program currently consists of 140 completed flights, and since the retirement of the US Space Shuttle has been the only craft to transport humans. The program's original goal was part of a program to put a cosmonaut on the Moon and later became crucial to the construction of the Mir space station.
International Space Station.
Recent space exploration has proceeded, to some extent in worldwide cooperation, the high point of which was the construction and operation of the International Space Station (ISS). At the same time, the international space race between smaller space powers since the end of the 20th century can be considered the foundation and expansion of markets of commercial rocket launches and space tourism.
The United States continued other space exploration, including major participation with the ISS with its own modules. It also planned a set of uncrewed Mars probes, military satellites, and more. The Constellation program, began by President George W. Bush in 2005, aimed to launch the Orion spacecraft by 2018. A subsequent return to the Moon by 2020 was to be followed by crewed flights to Mars, but the program was canceled in 2010 in favor of encouraging commercial US human launch capabilities.
Russia, a successor to the Soviet Union, has high potential but smaller funding. Its own space programs, some of a military nature, perform several functions. They offer a wide commercial launch service while continuing to support the ISS with several of their own modules. They also operate crewed and cargo spacecraft which continued after the US Shuttle program ended. They are developing a new multi-function Orel spacecraft for use in 2020 and have plans to perform human Moon missions as well.
European Space Agency.
The European Space Agency has taken the lead in commercial uncrewed launches since the introduction of the Ariane 4 in 1988 but is in competition with NASA, Russia, Sea Launch (private), China, India, and others. The ESA-designed crewed shuttle Hermes and space station Columbus were under development in the late 1980s in Europe; however, these projects were canceled, and Europe did not become the third major "space power".
The European Space Agency has launched various satellites, has utilized the crewed Spacelab module aboard US shuttles, and has sent probes to comets and Mars. It also participates in ISS with its own module and the uncrewed cargo spacecraft ATV.
Currently, ESA has a program for the development of an independent multi-function crewed spacecraft CSTS scheduled for completion in 2018. Further goals include an ambitious plan called the Aurora Programme, which intends to send a human mission to Mars soon after 2030. A set of various landmark missions to reach this goal are currently under consideration. The ESA has a multi-lateral partnership and plans for spacecraft and further missions with foreign participation and co-funding.
ESA is also developing the Galileo program which seeks to give independence to the EU from the American GPS.
China.
Since 1956 the Chinese have had a space program which was aided early on from 1957 to 1960 by the Soviets. "Dong Fang Hong I" was launched on 24 April 1970 and was the first satellite to be launched by the Chinese. With increased economic and technological strength in the following decades, especially since the early 21st century, China has made significant achievements in many aspects of space activities. It has developed a sizable family of Long March rockets, including Long March 5, the launch vehicle with the highest payload capacity in Asia . China launched more than 140 spaceflights between 2015 and 2020. China is operating multiple satellite systems, including communication, Earth imaging, weather forecast, ocean monitoring. BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, the satellite navigation system developed, launched, and operated by China, is one of the four core system providers of the International Committee on Global Navigation Satellite Systems.
The US Pentagon released a report in 2006, detailing concerns about China's growing presence in space, including its capability for military action. In 2007 China tested a ballistic missile designed to destroy satellites in orbit, which was followed by a US demonstration of a similar capability in 2008.
China Manned Space Program.
The China Manned Space Program, China's human spaceflight program, began in 1992. Following Shenzhou 5, the first successful crewed spaceflight mission in 2003 which made China the third country with independent human spaceflight capability, China has developed critical capabilities including EVA, space docking and berthing and space station. The Tiangong space station, China's modular orbital station, became fully operational in November 2022 and has been continuously manned since then. It consists of three main modules: the Tianhe core module (launched in April 2021), Wentian module (July 2022), and Mengtian module (October 2022).
The station conducts scientific experiments include testing materials for lunar habitats and studying biological changes in microgravity, contributing to China's ambitions for a lunar research base by the 2030s. The station is designed to remain operational for at least a decade, with plans to expand it to six modules and host the Xuntian space telescope in the future.
Chinese Lunar Exploration Program.
As the first step of distance outer space exploration, the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program was approved in 2004. It launched two lunar orbiters: Chang'e 1 and Chang'e 2 in 2007 and 2010 respectively. On 14 December 2013, China successfully soft-landed Chang'e 3 Moon lander and its rover "Yutu" on the Moon's surface, becoming the first Asian country to do so. This was followed by Chang'e 4, the first soft landing on the far side of the Moon, in 2019 and Chang'e 5, the first lunar sample return mission conducted by an Asian country, in 2020, marking the completion of the three goals (orbiting, landing, returning) of the first stage of the program. Starting from Chang'e 6, China wants to advance its plans in making a permanent International Lunar Research Station on the Moon.
Planetary Exploration of China.
China began its first interplanetary exploration attempt in 2011 by sending Yinghuo-1, a Mars orbiter, in a joint mission with Russia. Yet it failed to leave Earth orbit due to the failure of the Russian launch vehicle. As a result, the Chinese space agency then embarked on its independent Mars mission. In July 2020, China launched Tianwen-1, which included an orbiter, a lander, and a rover, on a Long March 5 rocket to Mars. Tianwen-1 was inserted into Mars orbit on 10 February 2021, followed by a successful landing and deployment of the Zhurong rover on 14 May 2021, making China the second country in the world which successfully soft-landed a fully operational spacecraft on Mars surface.
France.
Emmanuel Macron announced on 13 July 2019 the project to create a military command specialising in space, which would be based in Toulouse.
This command should be operational in September 2020 within the Air Force to become the Air and Space Force. Its purpose will be to strengthen France's space power in order to defend its satellites and deepen its knowledge of space. It will also aim to compete with other nations in this new place of strategic confrontation.
Japan.
Japan's space agency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is a major space player in Asia. While not maintaining a commercial launch service, Japan has deployed a module in the ISS and operates an uncrewed cargo spacecraft, the H-II Transfer Vehicle.
JAXA has plans to launch a Mars fly-by probe. Their lunar probe, SELENE, is touted as the most sophisticated lunar exploration mission in the post-Apollo era. Japan's Hayabusa probe was humankind's first sample return from an asteroid. IKAROS was the first operational solar sail.
Although Japan developed the HOPE-X, Kankoh-maru, and Fuji crewed capsule spacecraft, none of them have been launched. Japan's current ambition is to deploy a new crewed spacecraft by 2025 and to establish a Moon base by 2030.
Taiwan.
The National Space Organization (NSPO; formerly known as the National Space Program Office) and the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology are the national civilian space agencies of the democratic industrialized developed country of Taiwan under the auspices of the Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan). The National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology is involved in designing and building Taiwanese nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles, spacecraft and rockets for launching satellites while the National Space Organization is involved in space exploration, satellite construction, and satellite development as well as related technologies and infrastructure (including the FORMOSAT series of Earth observation satellites similar to NASA along with DARPA {In-Q-Tel} such as Google Earth {Keyhole, Inc} or so forth) and related research in astronautics, quantum physics, materials science with microgravity, aerospace engineering, remote sensing, astrophysics, atmospheric science, information science, design and construction of indigenous Taiwanese satellites and spacecraft, launching satellites and space probes into low Earth orbit. Additionally, a state of the art crewed spaceflight program is currently in development in Taiwan and is designed to compete directly with the crewed programs of China, United States and Russia. Active research is currently undergoing in the development and deployment of space-based weapons for the defense of national security in Taiwan.
India.
ISRO.
Indian Space Research Organisation, India's national space agency, maintains an active space program. It operates a small commercial launch service and launched a successful uncrewed lunar mission dubbed Chandrayaan-1 in October 2007. India successfully launched an interplanetary mission, Mars Orbiter Mission, in 2013 which reached Mars in September 2014, hence becoming the first country in the world to do a Mars mission in its maiden attempt. On July 22, 2019, India sent Chandrayaan-2 to the Moon, whose "Vikram" lander crashed on the lunar south pole region on September 6.
Other nations.
Cosmonauts and astronauts from other nations have flown in space, beginning with the flight of Vladimir Remek, a Czech, on a Soviet spacecraft on March 2, 1978. , a total of 536 people from 38 countries have gone into space according to the FAI guideline.
Private Companies.
SpaceX (USA).
SpaceX has used a fully reusable rocket named Starship. It consists of a first stage named Super Heavy and a second stage also named Starship.
Blue Origin.
Blue Origin made the first reusable space-capable rocket booster, New Shepard (it is suborbital, Falcon 9 was the first orbital). They also originally had the idea of landing rocket boosters on ships at sea; however, SpaceX replicated their idea and did it first. They lead the national team, which is designing a lunar lander and transfer vehicle (Integrated Lander Vehicle). They will contribute by modifying their Blue Moon lunar lander.
Bigelow Aerospace.
Bigelow Aerospace made the first commercial module in space (BEAM). They also designed and manufactured the first inflatable habitats in space ("Genesis I" and "Genesis II"). They also plan to make the first commercial space station around the moon (Lunar Depot), perhaps the first ever.
Northrop Grumman.
They make commercial resupply runs to the ISS with their Cygnus spacecraft. They also helped develop non-commercial spacecraft during the space race (Apollo LM as Grumman). They also are a part of the national team, led by Blue Origin which is designing a lunar lander and transfer vehicle (Integrated Lander Vehicle), partly based on Cygnus.

Two-a-days (football)

In American football, two-a-days occur when a team or individual trains on two occasions during the same day. Two-a-days are used primarily to get in shape for the season, and learn new strategies.
In the National Football League, two-a-days were eliminated in the 2011 collective bargaining agreement. Previously, teams ran double sessions and sometimes triple sessions for several weeks during the pre-season. Those practices are called training camp, and most teams travel to distant locations to hold their preparations.
In the media.
MTV featured a show entitled "Two-A-Days" from 2006 to 2007 which featured the football team of Hoover High School in Hoover, Alabama. The show chronicled the team's players' social lives as well as their involvement in the football team.
Criticisms.
In recent years, two-a-days have become less common due to controversy surrounding them. Recent years have marked an increase in player injury being brought about by heat-related causes. Heat stroke has become a major concern to football, and "two-a-days" are being red-flagged as a risky practice in places that experience traditionally hot weather in the summer. To address heat concerns, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 2003 prohibited two-a-days on consecutive days and during the first five days of practice. The National Athletic Trainers' Association suggested similar guidelines in June. Subsequently, two-a-days have become uncommon at the college level of football. Guidelines for high school football vary by state, but are becoming uncommon, although many high schools still continue to run two-a-days, especially in the southern states.
Players in the National Football League demanded the end of two-a-days as part of their collective bargaining in negotiations for a new contract in 2011, and became a part of their contract.

Vectrix

Vectrix was an electric vehicle company based in Middletown, Rhode Island, United States, with research and development facilities in New Bedford, Massachusetts and an assembly plant in Wrocław, Poland. 
Scooters.
Introduced in 2006, the Vectrix VX-1 was a maxi-size scooter, and was the first commercially available high-performance electric scooter. 
It was capable of over , and was reached in a little under 7 seconds, with maximum torque available from zero rpm, a characteristic of electric motors. It has under 250 parts, compared with 2,500 for a conventionally powered scooter, and has a range of up to at .
In the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands and Slovenia, the Vectrix was exempt from paying road tax.
The Vectrix scooter uses NiMH batteries with a manufacturer-claimed life of 10 years and 1,500 recharges.
The 125-volt battery pack has a capacity of 3.7 kW·h and can be recharged to 80% in two hours from a standard domestic power socket. The battery can also be partially recharged through regenerative braking.
Replacement cost of the battery is estimated to be around $3,000, almost one third of the cost of the bike.
In June 2008, Vectrix indicated that it planned to test lithium-ion battery packs based on lithium iron phosphate battery technology, in an agreement with GP Batteries International Limited of Hong Kong.
In the fall of 2008, Vectrix announced an expanded product line with two lower-priced bikes: The VX-1E was projected to arrive March 2009, with the VX-2 following in June 2009. Pre-production models of both bikes were shown at the New York International Motorcycle Show in January 2009 and also at Birmingham Motor Show, but they never entered production due to the company ceasing trading.
Concept vehicles.
Vectrix showed a superbike concept vehicle at the 2007 Milan motorcycle show, to be produced if 500 deposits were received.
In 2012 New Vectrix (re)-unveiled the super bike prototype at the SWISS-MOTO 2012 show in Zürich, Switzerland, announcing that they are taking orders and may produce the bike with as little as 200 pre-orders. 
In 2008, Vectrix announced a 3-wheeled version of the Vectrix Maxi scooter.
Testing by prospective users.
The New York City Police Department announced in December 2007 that it would be testing vehicles from Vectrix with the goal of replacing its current gasoline-powered scooters.
The Government of Canada purchased a vehicle from Vectrix in August 2008 with the goal of testing and evaluating a fully electric motorcycle's energy consumption, range, and additional road testing parameters. This environmental initiative was part of Transport Canada's ecoTECHNOLOGY for Vehicles (eTV) program.
New Vectrix.
For much of 2010 the company rehired old and new staff and began supporting old owners with issues again. In 2011 Vectrix introduced the VX-2 and the VX-1 Li/Li+ into the product line showing at some shows and updated on their website. The VX-1 Li is the same as the original bike but using lithium batteries of 30-amp hour capacity, for similar range and performance in a lighter bike. The Li+ has a 42-amp hour capacity, giving greater range. The VX-2 is designed as a smaller, lighter and less expensive version of the original bike for those who don't need freeway speeds or the weight of the original. Though it has similar range to the original, its top speed is less than half, but so is the price.
In 2012, Vectrix entered into a distribution agreement with Peirspeed to distribute Vectrix electric scooters in the U.S.
Loss of European distributors.
In October 2013, Vectrix lost its French distributor Italmotori after allegations of failing to ship scooters, batteries, and scooter parts required for repairs under warranty. In addition, in November 2013 a French automotive magazine after confirming that Italmotori was the third distributor (after Euromotor and Vectrix France) to cease representing Vectrix, reported that Vectrix appeared to be abandoning two models, its VX-1 and VX-3. A dealer in Portugal, Fuel Free Motors, asserts that they still will offer support for Vectrix scooters.
Shutdown of US operations, final bankruptcy filing and liquidation.
In January 2014 Vectrix ceased all US operations. After numerous manufacturing problems resulting in failed batteries and nonfunctioning scooters, Vectrix's parent company Gold Peak, a Chinese battery manufacturer, decided to close down Vectrix's US facilities. Vectrix intended to maintain its Poland fabrication plant in order to continue to supply parts for its joint venture with Daimler's Smart division.
In March 2014 Vectrix filed for bankruptcy again, this time under Chapter 7 for liquidation of the company. The court filings indicated assets of between $1 and $10 million and liabilities of between $10 and $50 million. The bankruptcy trustee announced an auction of the company's remaining assets, including unsold scooters, parts, and lithium batteries, to take place in June 2014.
Vectrix US and PL assets acquisition.
During the liquidation process the MPTECH group acquired the majority of the Vectrix US assets from the bankruptcy trustee and relocated them to Wrocław, Poland. Six months later, the entire assets of the Polish fabrication plant were acquired by MPTECH group and part of the heavy production equipment sold to GOVECS in order to expand their production capabilities.
In June 2015, the MPTECH group restarted the production of the VX-1 and VX-2 models, equipping them with completely new battery and electronics, internally design and produced.
Since the restart of operations, the new Vectrix company has re-established part of the former distribution network, restored supplier network, restored the spare parts availability, and begun market expansion plans.

Handley Page Type W

The Handley Page W.8, W.9 and W.10 were British two- and three-engine medium-range biplane airliners designed and built by Handley Page.
The W.8 (also known as the H.P.18) was the company's first purpose-built civil airliner although it was a development of the wartime Handley Page Type O/400 bomber via the O/7, O/10 and O/11 transports. It had an enclosed cabin for (in most versions) 12 passengers, along with two crew in an open cockpit, and has the distinction of being the world's first airliner to be designed with an on-board lavatory. The prototype first flew on 4 December 1919, shortly after it was displayed at the 1919 Paris Air Show at Le Bourget. The W.8 was subsequently revised to give the W.8b, W.8e (H.P.26), W.9 (H.P.27) and W.10 (H.P.30). It was also the basis for the W.8d (H.P.24), the Handley Page Hyderabad bomber.
Developments.
W.8.
Prototype, holding 15 passengers, powered by two 450 hp (336 kW) Napier Lion engines. The original company designation was to have been Handley Page W/400.
W.8b.
To meet an Air Ministry ruling, the capacity was reduced to 12 passengers and the fuel tanks were moved from the engine nacelles to above the top wing. The engines were changed from the Napier Lion to the less powerful but more economical Rolls-Royce Eagle IX. In 1921 the Air Ministry ordered three aircraft, built as the W.8b, for use by Handley Page Transport, and later by Imperial Airways, on services to Paris and Brussels. Another aircraft was delivered to Sabena in 1924 and three more were license built by SABCA in Belgium.
W.8c.
Planned but unbuilt 1923 alteration of W.8b for 1923 with the same engines but seating 16 passengers in a cabin lengthened by removal of the radio compartment and a reduction of freight capacity. The fuel tanks would have been moved to the underside of the top wing and slotted ailerons fitted.
W.8d.
The W.8d was the initial designation for the Handley Page Hyderabad heavy bomber.
W.8e.
To reduce the risks involved with engine failure, the W.8e was developed with one 360 hp (270 kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle IX in the nose and two 240 hp (180 kW) Siddeley Pumas in the normal position. The first W.8e was sold to Sabena, which had 10 more built in Belgium by SABCA.
W.8f and W.8g Hamilton.
One three-engine W.8f was built with cabin heating (derived from air circulated around the hot engine exhausts).
The W.8f was modified in 1929 as the W.8g with an improved tail and rudder design from the W.10 and the third engine was removed and the other two replaced with Rolls-Royce type F.XIIA engines.
W.9a Hampstead.
Was a three-engined version with more powerful 385 hp (290 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar IV radial engines. It was operated by Imperial Airways and created a record on the London-Paris route of 86 minutes. In 1926, the engines were replaced by three 420 hp (310 kW) Bristol Jupiters. The aircraft was moved to Australia but was destroyed in an accident after nine months.
W.10.
A twin-engined variant with the 450 hp (340 kW) Napier Lion for Imperial Airways (four built).
Use.
When Imperial Airways introduced the Handley Page HP.42 in 1931, the W series aircraft were retired. Aircraft were used by private operators for display and joy riding, but the most important development concerned the two surviving W.10s which were converted to tanker aircraft by Sir Alan Cobham.

Refugee travel document

A refugee travel document (also called a 1951 Convention travel document or Geneva passport) is a travel document issued to a refugee by the state which they normally reside in, allowing them to travel outside that state and to return there. Refugees are unlikely to be able to obtain passports from their state of nationality (from which they have sought asylum) and therefore need travel documents so that they might engage in international travel.
The 145 states which are parties to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees are obliged to issue travel documents to refugees lawfully resident in their territory.
Refugee travel documents are passport-like booklets. Their cover bears the words "Travel Document" in English and French (and often in the language of the issuing state), as well as the date of the convention: 28 July 1951. The documents were originally grey, though some countries now issue them in other colours, with two diagonal lines in the upper left corner of the front cover. Bearers enjoy certain visa-free travel privileges extended by signatories to the convention.
However, as a refugee travel document is not a regular national passport, some problems may be encountered by the holder from time to time, for example due to non-familiarity of airline staff with such documents.

1954 Convention travel document

A 1954 Convention travel document is a travel document, unlike a Stateless travel document (stateless person by a signatory to the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons), issued to a person in circumstances of any difficulties in gaining a travel document from their country of origin. The cover bears the words "travel document" in English and French (and often in the language of the issuing state) along with the date of the convention, but does not bear the two stripes appearing in the upper left corner of the front cover of refugee travel documents. However, some countries, such as Australia and Japan, issue stateless persons travel documents with other names such as Certificate of Identity or Re-entry Permit, etc., regardless of whether the country is a contracting state of 1954 Convention.

William Campbell Preston Breckinridge

William Campbell Preston Breckinridge (August 28, 1837 – November 18, 1904) was a lawyer and Democratic politician from Kentucky; a U.S. Representative from 1885 to 1895. He was a scion of the Breckinridge political family: grandson of Senator John Breckinridge, and first cousin of Vice President John C. Breckinridge.
Biography.
Early life and education.
William Breckinridge was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Robert Jefferson Breckinridge, a prominent Kentucky minister, educator, and Unionist politician. His mother was the former Ann Sophonisba Preston. He was raised in Pennsylvania, where his father was president of Jefferson College.
Breckinridge graduated from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, in 1855. He then studied as a medical doctor for a year but switched to law. He earned his "Juris Doctor" from the University of Louisville in 1857. He returned to Lexington, Kentucky, to engage in the practice of law. At this time, he married Lucretia Clay, a granddaughter of Henry Clay. She died in 1860.
Civil War.
Despite his father's Unionist position (the elder Breckinridge supported the election of Lincoln), William entered the Confederate States Army in 1861. He was commissioned as a captain. He served in the cavalry under John Hunt Morgan. By the war's end, he was Colonel of the 9th Kentucky Cavalry. He also served as a bodyguard to Jefferson Davis during his flight from Richmond.
Following the war, he returned to Lexington, Kentucky, where he resumed the legal profession, teaching jurisprudence at the University of Kentucky.
Post-Civil War.
From 1866 to 1868, he also served as the editor of the Lexington "Observer and Reporter". In 1869, Breckinridge ran unsuccessfully for county attorney, losing in large part because he was supported allowing African-Americans to testify in the courts. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1884 as a Democrat and was re-elected four times, serving from 1885 to 1895.
He had, in later years, married Issa Desha. After she died in 1892, he married Louise Wing.
In 1890, he became a charter member of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. He was a Mason, and a member of the Masonic Knights Templar.
In 1893, his long-time mistress Madeleine V. Pollard filed suit against Breckinridge for breach of promise for his failure to marry her as promised. The trial was a national sensation; the revelations of Breckinridge's infidelity and his weak defense of the breach of promise charge led to the loss of the lawsuit and contributed to the end of his political career.
In 1896, he ran for Congress on a strong currency fusion ticket but was defeated. After this, he was hired by the "Lexington Morning Herald" as their chief editorial writer.
At the November 1901 Convention of the State Federation of Labor in Lexington, Breckinridge delivered an eloquent speech in which he extolled the virtues of a six-day workweek, opposed violent strikes, and encouraged negotiations. The following day, the group's vice president, James D. Wood, took over the convention and helped pass resolutions that called Breckinridge an "enemy of the trade and labor organizations of the state." The controversy which followed split the federation's membership.
Support of racial equality.
After the Civil War, William Breckinridge became an advocate of racial equality. The sooner Americans rid themselves of cruel racists in their midst, he said, "the sooner they will realize that their institutions are in no danger, their civilization is not at stake, and that their permanent and practical undisputed sway can not be overturned." He opposed literacy tests and other means of black disenfranchisement, hoping that someday, "all races might enjoy a common liberty secured by an imperial law."
As editor of the "Observer and Reporter" in 1866–1868, he advocated the repeal of the restrictions on Negro testimony. Breckinridge and other "New Departure" men believed that admitting blacks to full civil rights, including the right to testify against whites, was a prerequisite for progress. Unusually, they proposed to accomplish this through the Democratic Party, which at this time was for white supremacy.
As an attorney, he represented blacks in court. When a Franklin County black man was convicted of murdering a prominent citizen who had led a mob to seize him, Breckinridge fought to obtain a pardon. In 1869, Breckinridge ran for state's attorney in Boyle County, and the testimony question was the central issue of his campaign. He intended to admit black testimony in all cases and upheld Fayette County as an example that the whole state should follow.
As a U.S. Representative, Breckinridge had asked the commissioner of labor to retain a black Census Office worker who feared that he would be fired because of race.
He expressed admiration for both Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. DuBois. Comparing Booker T. Washington's "Up From Slavery" with DuBois' "The Souls of Black Folk", he called both books "remarkable contributions" to literature and termed "Souls" "the most significant and remarkable utterance yet published by a negro." He recommended both books and both men to his readers.
A young black lawyer offered aid to Breckinridge during his 1894 problems, noting that he had helped many "young colored men" in their law careers. Breckinridge predicted a better day for race relations: "Barriers will be removed, prejudices will die, class distinctions be obliterated. Not at once, not in our day; not without fierce contest; not without heroism and sacrifice, but yet slowly, surely, the day grows stronger; the sun rises higher toward the better noon and the glad twilight." Echoing his father, he wrote: "The negro is a man and the race in its essential unity is one race. Of one blood were all men made."
Family and death.
In 1859, Breckinridge married Lucia Clay. In 1861, he married Issa Desha; they were the parents of Sophonisba Breckinridge, Desha Breckinridge, and Robert Jefferson Breckinridge. In 1893, he married Louise Scott Wing. In 1893, Madeleine Pollard brought suit for breach of promise for his failure to make good on a promise of marriage. Breckinridge lost the ensuing court battle and shortly thereafter, failed to win reelection to Congress.
Breckinridge died November 18, 1904, and is interred in Lexington Cemetery.

Benjamin Nivet

Benjamin Nivet (born 2 January 1977) is a French former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.
He began his career in 1997 with Auxerre, and is best known for his association with Troyes, whom he represented over 12 years in two separate spells, from 2002 to 2007 and later from 2012 until his retirement in 2019. Nivet holds the records at Troyes for most appearances and most goals for the club.
Career.
Born in Chartres, Nivet started his career as a youth with Auxerre. He made his first league appearances in the 1997–98 season. However, by the end of the following season, he had made only twelve further appearances and was sent on loan to Ligue 2 club Châteauroux for the 1999–2000 season, before making the move permanent for the next season.
After establishing himself as a regular for Châteauroux, he made the step back up to Ligue 1 with Troyes in January 2002. Despite a slow start, Nivet established himself as a regular in the club's 2002–03 relegation season. Wearing the number 10 shirt, he proved an eye for goal, weighing in with 12 goals in Troyes' 2005–06 promotion season. He played at Troyes from 2002 to 2007.
He signed a three-year contract with Stade Malherbe Caen on 8 June 2007, a club newly promoted to Ligue 1.
After five years in Caen, he could not avoid relegation at the end of the 2011–12 season. A free agent, he returned to Troyes, promoted to Ligue 1, signing a one-year contract on 11 June 2012. After four years with Troyes, he could not avoid relegation at the end of the 2015–16 season after a disastrous campaign which saw the club win only three matches and concede some heavy defeats, most notably a resounding 9–0 home loss to PSG, the club's biggest ever victory.
On 8 January 2017, Nivet, who had turned 40 just six days before, played his 650th professional match and scored twice against his former club Auxerre in a 4–2 loss in the round of 64 of the 2016–17 Coupe de France. On 28 May 2017, the 40-year-old Nivet scored a late winner in the second leg of the promotion play-off against Lorient, which turned out to be the decisive goal that saw Troyes promoted to Ligue 1.
In the top division, Nivet was only able to reach a rich vein of form towards the end of the 2017–18 season, when he registered one goal contribution for three matches in a row, including a goal against Olympique de Marseille on 15 April 2018, becoming, at the age of 41 years and 103 days, the oldest player to ever score in Ligue 1, thus breaking the previous record set by Vitorino Hilton on 7 February 2017, at the age of 39. He then extended this record when he scored again just two weeks later, on 28 April, in a 3–1 win over Stade Malherbe Caen.
In the spring of 2019, Nivet announced his retirement from professional football aged 42. Nivet perhaps deserved to play in a more upscale club, but his loyalty to Troyes and his innate modesty prevent that. In fact, he even reportedly declined an offer from the City of Troyes to build a statue in his honour.

Jimmy McNichol

James Vincent McNichol III (born July 2, 1961), known professionally as Jimmy McNichol, is an American actor and singer who first gained fame as a teen idol in the late 1970s. At the beginning of his career his popularity quickly grew, causing networks like CBS to create and implement multiple television series specifically for his involvement and leading roles. After making a record number of appearances on top talk shows he was viewed by many as "the face you see everywhere."
In 1978, McNichol recorded an album with his sister, Kristy, also a child actress, and the two went on to host a youth-oriented variety show for ABC. McNichol subsequently had lead roles in "Smokey Bites the Dust" (1981), and opposite Susan Tyrrell in the horror film "Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker" (1981). After retiring from acting in the 1990s, McNichol relocated with his family to Colorado, and has been active in environmentalist causes, and working as a real estate investor and home renovator.
Biography.
1961–1966: Early life.
James Vincent McNichol III was born July 2, 1961 in Los Angeles, California, to James and Carolyn McNichol. He is of Lebanese and Irish descent. McNichol is the oldest of three siblings, with a sister Kristy (b. 1962) and brother Tommy (b. 1965). McNichol was raised by his single mother after the children's father, a carpenter, abandoned the family shortly after Tommy's birth. Their mother worked as an RN to support her family. Tommy was raised separately from him and Kristy, by his grandparents in Burbank.
1967–1991: Acting and music career.
He began his career at age 7, acting in a Band-Aid commercial. He appeared in roughly 80 commercials from 1967 to 1973, including spots for Kool-Aid and Crest. He landed minor roles on shows such as "Little House on the Prairie" (1974) and "S.W.A.T." (1975).
His first film appearance was an uncredited role in "Sunshine" (1973) at the age of 12. His first regular starring role was as younger brother Jack on the network series "The Fitzpatricks". Michele Tobin played his sister, Mo, on the show, and they later worked together on "California Fever". McNichol sang the show's theme song and in 1978 recorded an album with his sister, "Kristy and Jimmy McNichol", produced by Phil &amp; Mitch Margo. The album spawned one hit single, a cover of The Chiffons' "He's So Fine", which charted at #70 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1978. The siblings also appeared as co-hosts of the fall 1978 "ABC All-Star Saturday Preview Special", a youth-oriented sketch comedy show featuring musical guests such as the Bee Gees and Donny Osmond. McNichol and his sister, however, ceased performing together after Kristy had a manic breakdown while the two were in France; she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Afterward, McNichol stepped away from the music industry, later commenting: "I know the outcomeit's a real big high one year, and the next year, nobody knows who you are. All that singing and touring and the guys behind you doing drugs. Eventually it's gonna get to you."
When "California Fever" ended, he won the role as host of a weekly talk show, "Hollywood Teen", as well as the "Jimmy McNichol Special", which first aired in April 1980. He also starred in the television film "" (1979), a teen drama about an ex-hockey player and figure skater who fall in love. He subsequently appeared in several other successful made-for-TV movies, including the thriller "Blinded by the Light" (1980), in which he starred opposite his sister Kristy as a gay teenager who escapes a religious cult. He also made several low-budget feature films, including "Smokey Bites the Dust" (1981) and the horror film "Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker" (1982), co-starring with Susan Tyrrell and Bill Paxton.
In 1984, McNichol accepted the role of Josh Clayton on "General Hospital". He performed in a band throughout the 1980s under the name "Jimmy James". His last major acting role was as Jill Ireland's son Valentine McCallum in the 1991 television film "Reason for Living", co-starring Jill Clayburgh. After completing "Reason for Living", at age 30, McNichol decided to retire from professional acting.
1992–present: Post-acting career.
McNichol married his wife, Renée, in 1997. They had a son, Nash, in late 1997, and a daughter, Ellis, in late 1998. McNichol is an avid environmentalist and in 1998 was focusing on ecological education with a web site called ECOTV. Since leaving acting, McNichol began a career in residential construction and home rehabilitation. He also collaborated with Playground Television and Pet Power Kids on "Animal Rescue The Rockies" (or "ARTR"), a TV series documenting animal rescue and related issues.
In 2006, McNichol and his family relocated from Santa Barbara, California, to Durango, Colorado, where he still resided as of 2016. In 2010, he discovered he had a third child: daughter Kellee Maize, a rap artist, songwriter, and entrepreneur from Pittsburgh who had been raised by adoptive parents in Pennsylvania. Their new familial bond was profiled in 2014 by Oprah Winfrey.

Vasyl Stefanyk

Vasyl Semenovych Stefanyk (; May 14, 1871 – December 7, 1936) was an influential Ukrainian modernist writer and political activist. He was a member of the Austrian parliament from 1908 to 1918.
Biography.
Early years.
Vasyl Stefanyk was born on May 14, 1871, in the village of Rusiv in the family of a well-to-do peasant. He was born in the historical region of Pokuttia, then part of Austria-Hungary. Today it is part of Kolomyia Raion, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. He died on December 7, 1936, in the same village, Rusiv, at that time the part of Poland.
His primary education Stefanyk was at the Sniatyn City school. He later studied at Polish gymnasia in Kolomyia and Drohobych. He was expelled from the Kolomea gymnasium for the participation in a revolutionary group. He eventually graduated from the Drohobych gymnasium, and enrolled in the University of Kraków in 1892.
In culture.
Stefanyk's "Blue Book" was republished in Ukraine in 1966 under the title "The Maple Leaves" in an edition lavishly illustrated by Mykhaylo Turovsky.
Three stories from the "Blue Book" were the basis of the classic Ukrainian 1968 film "The Stone Cross" by Leonid Osyka.
Abroad.
Stefanyk was deeply concerned with the destiny of Ukrainian immigrants to Canada and often mentioned them in his many writings. One of his stories, "The Stone Cross" (Kaminnyi Khrest), (later made into a movie) is a stirring account of an immigrant's departure from Stefanyk's native village, Rusiv. The man upon whom it is based died in 1911, in Hilliard, Alberta.
The monument that was erected to commemorate Vasyl' Stefanyk is located at the Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village, east of Edmonton, Alberta. That is a statue that was a gift from Ukraine to the Association of United Ukrainian Canadians. The statue was sculpted by W. Skolozdra in 1971 to mark the 100th anniversary of Vasyl Stefanyk.

He played professional football for the Hammond Pros and Akron Pros of the National Football League (NFL) as a tackle and center in 1920.
While Moran was serving in the U.S. Navy in 1908, he knocked out fighter Fred Cooley in the second round. While serving on the U.S.S. Mayflower, he served as a spar partner for President Theodore Roosevelt. He began his career as a prize-fighter that same year with a match against Fred Broad. Soon, Moran, who had a hard right hand punch which he called "Mary Ann", became known as the "White Hope" of the teens. In 1914 he fought Jack Johnson for the Heavyweight Championship of the World, and in 1916 "The Fighting Dentist" went up against Jess Willard for the same title, but lost both bouts. He lost his last fight to Marcel Nilles for the Heavyweight Championship of France on December 22, 1922. He retired from boxing after 66 bouts with a record of 36 wins (28 by a knockout), 13 losses, 16 draws and 1 no contest.
Frank Moran was inducted into the Pennsylvania Boxing Hall of Fame in 2012.
Film career.
After acting in one show on Broadway in 1926 – a stage adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's novel "An American Tragedy" – Moran made his film debut in 1928 when he did two silent films, "The Chinatown Mystery" and "Ships of the Night", but his film career didn't start in earnest until 1933, when he appeared as himself in "The Prizefighter and the Lady", and also in Mae West's "She Done Him Wrong", in which he played a convict. This was typical of the kinds of roles Moran was to play for the next 25 years – gangsters, henchmen, "plug uglies", bartenders, stage hands, sailors, guards, cops, bouncers, moving men, sergeants and other soldiers – roles which belied his personal gentleness and sensitivity.
In the 1940s, Moran was part of Preston Sturges' unofficial "stock company" of character actors, appearing in every American film written and directed by Sturges with one exception. He was seen in "The Great McGinty", "Christmas in July", "The Lady Eve", "Sullivan's Travels", "The Palm Beach Story", "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek", "Hail the Conquering Hero", "The Great Moment", "The Sin of Harold Diddlebock" and "Unfaithfully Yours". It was Moran who, as a cop in Sturges' "Christmas in July" (1940), halted a tirade by an argumentative Jewish storeowner by barking, "Who do ya think you are, Hitler?" And it was Moran who, as a tough chauffeur in "Sullivan's Travels" (1942), patiently explains to his traveling companions the meaning of the word "paraphrase."
Moran was usually credited for his performances, but almost never received star or featured billing. One exception was Monogram Pictures's "Return of the Ape Man" (1944), starring Bela Lugosi and John Carradine, in which Moran shared credit for the title role with George Zucco, although, in fact, Zucco became ill and Moran replaced him – Zucco does not appear in the film as released. Also, at the beginning of his acting career, Moran was part of the featured cast in Raoul Walsh's "Sailor's Luck" (1933).
Other notable films in which Moran appeared include Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times" 1936, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers's "Follow the Fleet," "Shall We Dance", and "Carefree" (1938), Frank Capra's "Meet John Doe" (1941), 1943's "Lady of Burlesque" starring Barbara Stanwyck and "Road to Utopia" with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby (1946).
Moran's final film appearance was an uncredited bit part in "The Iron Sheriff", a Western, in 1957 at the age of 70. He was 80 when he died in Hollywood, California on 14 December 1967 of a heart attack.

Violet Markham

Violet Rosa Markham (October 1872 – 2 February 1959) was a writer, social reformer, campaigner against women's suffrage and administrator. She grew up near Chesterfield, Derbyshire. Actively involved in community and welfare work, she held a number of public positions, including in educational administration, and social assistance and poverty relief bodies. Despite her opposition to women's suffrage, she stood for election as a Liberal Party candidate in the 1918 General Election, without success, and later served as town councillor and the first female mayor of Chesterfield. Her writings on her travels and an autobiographical work, among others, were published during her lifetime. Markham married James Carruthers in 1915; he died in 1936.
Background and early life.
Violet Markham was the daughter of Charles Paxton Markham, part owner of the profitable Markham Collieries and Markham &amp; Co. Engineering of Chesterfield. Her mother was a daughter of Sir Joseph Paxton, designer of the Crystal Palace, the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition of 1851. When a friend of her late father died in 1901, Violet inherited enough money to live an independent life and devote her wealth to causes she supported, as well as to buy her own house in London.
Politics and activism.
Community work.
Her first interest was education. Markham was a member of the Chesterfield Education Authority from 1899 to 1934, and in 1902 she was the founder President of the Chesterfield Settlement, an educational foundation for the local community which existed until 1958. While travelling to South Africa in the summer of 1899, Markham met Lady Edward Cecil. The two became good friends, and together created the Victoria League in 1901.
Later she became involved in public service in different sectors. At the outbreak of the First World War, she became a member of the Executive Committee of the National Relief Fund, established to alleviate distress caused by the war. The fund dispensed aid to service families and dependents, as well as civilians. The experience of this organisation left her with a lifelong interest in reducing the effects of poverty and unemployment, especially with regard to women. In 1914 she became a member and later chairman of the Central Committee of Women's Training and Employment, which in 25 years trained nearly 100,000 women, mainly for domestic service. In 1917 she was made deputy director of the women's section of the National Service League, and was one of the first recipients of the Order of the Companions of Honour. In 1920 she began a long period as a member of the Industrial Court, and became a member of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee for Women Justices.
In 1934, she became a member of the Unemployment Assistance Board, becoming Deputy chairman in 1937 – "probably the most important administrative post up to that time that had been held by a woman", according to her obituary in "The Times". When the Second World War began, it was inevitable that her talents would be called on. She organised an all-night canteen for the poor of South London. She was on the appeal tribunal of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, and in 1942, she was asked to produce a report on allegations of immorality in the women's services. In 1945 she produced a report with Florence Hancock on the postwar organisation of domestic service.
Electoral politics.
Markham was also active politically. In the 1918 General Election, she stood as the official Liberal candidate for the Mansfield Division of Nottinghamshire. (The Coalition Coupon went to Jarrett); 
She was elected as a town councillor for Chesterfield in 1924, and served as the first female Mayor of Chesterfield in 1927. It would be 39 years before Chesterfield had another female Mayor.
Views.
Despite being a social reformer, Violet Markham was strongly opposed to women being given the vote. She addressed an anti-suffrage meeting at the Royal Albert Hall on 28 February 1912 (publicised in a letter to "The Spectator" published on 10 February 1912) which had been organised by the National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage. Markham told the audience that the views of the women's suffrage movement "fly in the face of hard facts and natural law." She went on to say that, "We believe that men and women are different – not similar – beings, with talents that are complementary, not identical, and that they therefore ought to have different shares in the management of the State, that they severally compose. We do not depreciate by one jot or tittle women’s work and mission. We are concerned to find proper channels of expression for that work. We seek a fruitful diversity of political function, not a stultifying uniformity."
Although Markham opposed women's suffrage, Mary Stocks, herself a women's suffrage supporter, considered her to be "the best feminist I've ever known, a real feminist".
The idea that there should also be Girl Scouts, as counterpart to the new Boy Scout Movement, following their appearance at the 1909 Crystal Palace Rally, met with Markham's strong disapproval, as expressed in "The Spectator".
Personal life.
Markham travelled extensively abroad. Among her friends was the Canadian politician Mackenzie King, whom she met in 1905 and with whom she kept up an active correspondence for 45 years. King visited her when he was in England and she visited him on her occasional trips to Canada. She sent him money on a number of occasions, notably after his electoral defeat in 1911, and again to provide medical treatment for his brother who was suffering from tuberculosis. In 1923, the Canadian government appointed her to represent them on the governing body of the International Labour Organization in Geneva.
In 1915, Markham married Lieutenant-Colonel James Carruthers, but she continued to be known by her maiden name. She accompanied her husband to Cologne, when he was stationed there as chief demobilisation officer for the British Army of the Rhine, following the First World War. Her husband was subsequently a racehorse owner, who died suddenly at Ayr Racecourse in 1936. She wrote several books, including "Paxton and the Bachelor Duke", a biography of her grandfather (1935), her autobiography, "Return Passage" (1953), and "Friendship's Harvest" (1956).

Chet Kehn

Chester Lawrence Kehn (October 30, 1921 – April 5, 1984) was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1942. At 20 years of age, he was the fourth-youngest player to appear in a National League game that season.
Kehn is one of many ballplayers who only appeared in the major leagues during World War II. He made his major league debut on April 30, 1942, as a starting pitcher against the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field. The Dodgers won 11–8, but Kehn was not the winning pitcher. He made only two more appearances, both in relief, before his big league career was over due to a shoulder separation. In three games he was 0–0 with two games finished, and allowed six earned runs in 7.2 innings pitched for a final ERA of 7.04.
Kehn proved to be a better hitter and fielder than he was as a pitcher, at least at the major league level. At the plate he was 2-for-2 (1.000) with one RBI and one run scored, and in the field he handled four chances without an error (1.000).
Kehn retired from baseball in 1950 after several years in Santa Barbara as their manager; later.he had a very successful career in retail management.
Kehn died in his hometown of San Diego, California, at the age of 62.

<doc id="6949569" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6949569" title="Alexander Pomerantsev">
Alexander Pomerantsev

Alexander Nikanorovich Pomerantsev (; 11 November 1849 — 27 October 1918) was a Russian architect and educator responsible for some of the most ambitious architectural projects realized in Imperial Russia and Bulgaria at the turn of the 20th century. An accomplished eclecticist, Pomerantsev practiced Art Nouveau, Byzantine, Russian Revival styles and collaborated with leading structural engineers of his period in creating new types of commercial buildings.
Training and early career.
Pomerantsev was born in Moscow and graduated from the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in 1874. He furthered his education at the Imperial Academy of Arts (1874–78), winning the Academy scholarship for a five-year study tour of Italy, France and Switzerland (1878–1883). In 1887 he was awarded title of "Academic of Architecture" for his study of Cappella Palatina (1887, revised edition 1911).
The first buildings by Pomerantsev were built in Rostov-on-Don; the block-sized Moskovskaya Hotel, Rostov City Hall, and the Gench-Ogluev House (1883) were at that time the largest structures in the city. These buildings followed the European eclectic tradition.
Upper Trading Rows.
In 1889 Pomerantsev won an open competition to design the Moscow Upper Trading Rows (now GUM) on Red Square, his first large, and perhaps his most conspicuous project. It was "a turning point in Russian architectural history, not only because it represented the apogee of the search for a national style but also because it demanded advanced functional technology applied on a scale unprecedented in Russian civil architecture." Pomerantsev provided overall planning and architectural design, Vladimir Shukhov – structural design. According to William Craft Brumfield, "that the enormous Upper Trading Rows functioned, if imperfectly, is a tribute both to Shukhov's design and to the technical proficiency of Russian architecture toward the end of the century. The use of reinforced concrete for the interior walls and vaulting eliminated the need for thick masonry support walls and provided the space for circulation and light. For maintenance, there was a network of basement corridors, beneath which was a subbasement with heating boilers and an electrical generating station. Every element of professional architecture, from educational institutions to the open competition system, contributed to the project." Critics noted disjunction of functional concrete and steel structure and elaborate Russian Revival styling that consumed 40 million bricks. While upper floor galleries benefited from Shukhov's skylights, lower level suffered from inadequate ventilation, and, as a result, demand for shop space in the building did not meet the expectations.
1896 Exhibition.
In 1895 Pomerantsev was appointed chief architect of the 1896 All-Russian Exhibition in Nizhny Novgorod, an event heralded as the guiding light for the upcoming 20th century. Master plan and principal pavilions of the exhibition are credited personally to Pomerantsev. Most pavilions relied on novel steel frame load-bearing structures designed by Shukhov; they "represented the most advanced use of metal-frame construction for their time and possibly the first use of a metal membrane roof" (Shukhov Rotunda). Pomerantsev's "Pavilion of Arts" was based on traditional structure, but stylistically predated Charles Girault's Petit Palais (1900) and is considered the forerunner of emerging Russian Art Nouveau. When the Pavilion was eventually torn down, its framing and finishes were reused for the "People's House" theater in Saint Petersburg.
Moscow Ring Railroad.
Around 1900 Pomerantsev joined the team of engineers and architects (Peter Rashevsky, Lavr Proskuryakov, Nikolai Markovnikov) of the Moscow Smaller Ring Railroad, a 54 kilometer ring freight line around the city. Pomerantsev provided architectural design to 20 stations of the Ring, employee housing, warehouses, roundhouses and water towers, as well as to two of Proskuryakov's bridges (now demolished, see Andreyevsky Bridge and Krasnoluzhsky Bridge). Regular traffic on the Ring commenced in July 1908. Station designs by Pomerantsev mixed motifs of Vienna Secession, Victorian Gothic and traditional eclecticism leaning to neoclassicism yet were clearly styled as a cohesive ensemble. All were built in unfinished red brick with white decorative inserts in line with industrial architecture of the period.
Cathedrals.
Pomerantsev lost the 1893–1894 competition for the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Warsaw to Leon Benois; both architects filed Russian Revival proposals, however, Pomerantsev leaned to "red brick" churches of Alexander II period covered with ornamental cliches and crowned with Thon-styled dome; draft by Benois was a refined nod to Vladimir Rus architecture. In 1907-1911 Pomerantsev designed the new building for Moskovsky Rail Terminal, retaining Thon's original facade; the project did not materialize.
In 1898 Pomerantsev designed Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia. The Neo-Byzantine cathedral, rated for 5,000 worshippers, was built to commemorate the Russian soldiers perished during the 1877–1878 war. Work began in 1882, although most of the structure was actually built in 1904–1912.
Pomerantsev' last major work was also a church dedicated to Saint Alexander Nevsky (his own patron saint). It was the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in the remote Miusskaya Square of Moscow. The large 17-dome Russian Revival church was conceived in 1900 by Pomerantsev and Victor Vasnetsov to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Emancipation reform of 1861. Pomerantsev himself contributed financially to the construction that dragged from 1910 until the February Revolution. In 1934 Arkady Mordvinov and Alexey Dushkin proposed conversion of the unfinished cathedral into the "Radio House" skyscraper; the plan never materialized and the dilapidated concrete shell was torn down in 1952.
Educator.
Pomerantsev joined the faculty of the Academy in 1888; in 1893 he was elected full member of the Academy. Pomerantsev headed a department of its Art College since 1893 and briefly headed the Academy itself in 1899-1900. Since 1899 Pomerantsev also served as visiting professor at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture.
In 1893 the Academy reformed its architectural school, creating three parallel graduate workshops, and assigned Leon Benois, Pomerantsev and Antony Tomishko (after the death of Tomishko in 1900 his seat was awarded to Mikhail Preobrazhensky. The first graduation under the new rules (1896) was not good for Pomerantsev; only one of his students passed the bar compared to ten for Benois and ten for Tomishko. Although Pomerantsev was the eldest of three professors, Benois was clearly more popular among students, and his workshop regularly had more regular students than Pomerantsev’s (1902: 27 vs. 14, 1903: 22 vs. 9 etc.). His best known alumni included Ivan Rylsky, Alexander Tamanian and Sergey Serafimov.

National Association Football League

The National Association Football League (also spelled "National Association Foot Ball League") (NAFBL) was a semi-professional U.S. soccer league which operated between 1895 and 1898. The league was reconstituted in 1906 and continued to operate until 1921.
History.
The NAFBL was formed in January 1885 and in March 1895, the NAFBL began operation as the third significant U.S. soccer league. It drew its teams primarily from northern New Jersey and New York City. Few records exist for the league, but the teams and standings for four of the five seasons do exist. After its first spring-summer season in 1895, the NAFBL moved to a winter schedule in the fall of 1895.
On December 16, 1895, the NAFBL opened its second season with a game pitting the Kearny Scottish-Americans and the International Athletic Club. In 1899, a deep recession, accompanied by the Spanish–American War led to the collapse of several athletic leagues and teams, among them the NAFBL. On August 14, 1906, the league was revived and continued in operation until 1921. That year, several of the top NAFBL teams, frustrated by the amateur/semi-professional nature of the league, joined with other top North Atlantic U.S. teams to form the first fully professional U.S. soccer league, the American Soccer League.

Life and Work (magazine)

Life and Work is the editorially independent monthly magazine of the Church of Scotland. 
History.
It was founded in 1879 by Archibald Hamilton Charteris. "Life and Work" was an initiative of the Church's Committee of Christian Life and Work, which was led by Charteris, a professor of biblical criticism at Edinburgh University who was also founder of the Woman's Guild.
In its early years, Life and Work ran various supplements, including the Guild supplement and the Young Men's Supplement. Of these, only the Gaelic supplement is still running.
It incorporated the Mission Record of the Church of Scotland from 1900, and at the 1929 union of the Church, it merged with United Free Church's "The Record" as Life and Work: The Record of the Church of Scotland.
At its height, the magazine was read by around a quarter of the Scottish population, reflecting the high point of membership within the denomination, and broader allegiance to the Christian faith within Scotland.
The Present Day.
Though the magazine is rooted within the life and work of the Church of Scotland, it also aims to cover a broad range of subjects that may interest others within the denomination, and other interested people. These include stories and articles about international affairs and British political and social issues, as well as other topical and ethical issues. In addition, there are book reviews, features representing the worldwide church, and reflections and devotional elements.
The magazine was voted best Member Magazine of the Year at the PPA Scottish magazine awards in 2004. In addition, it has been nominated numerous times since. It has also been awarded a prestigious Andrew Cross award in 2005 by the UK wide Churches Media Council.
In January 2006 the magazine reverted, at a relaunch in full colour, to its older title "Life and Work", instead of "Life &amp; Work". In addition, it dropped the subtitle of ""The Record of the Church of Scotland"."
In April 2013 a Life and Work website was launched, including extracts from the magazine as well as additional news and features.
At the 2025 General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, it was decided to end the publication of Life and Work magazine by the end of 2025. Until 2020, the magazine had produced a surplus, but with falling readership, and subsequently reduced advertising revenue, the magazine was making losses each year since. At the Assembly, it was suggested that proposals should be brought to the 2026 Assembly to create a future publication. And, it was also proposed that a future Church of Scotland magazine should also remain editorially independent.
Gaelic Supplement.
"Life and Work" has a 4-page Gaelic supplement, Na Duilleagan Gàidhlig, established in January 1880, which is included on request, and is also available online. No Gaelic periodical has lasted as long as the Life and Work's Gaelic edition. In those 145 years, there has only been four editors from different parts of the Gaelic Highlands.
List of editors.
The magazine has had 14 editors in its history. Its current, and longest serving, editor is Lynne McNeil.

Joseph Marrese

Joseph Anthony Marrese (March 12, 1922 – April 18, 2012) was an Italian-born Canadian realtor and politician. He was a member of the Toronto Metropolitan Separate School Board for most of the period between 1966 and 1983, and was its chair from 1972 to 1975. His political career ended following a criminal conviction in November 1983.
Early political career.
Marrese was born on March 12, 1922, in Italy, and moved to Canada with his family during the mid-1920s at the age of two. He was a successful realtor in Metropolitan Toronto before entering political life. He was first elected to the Separate School Board's thirteenth ward in 1966, aged 43, and was re-elected without opposition in 1969. By 1971, he was chairman of the board's planning and development committee. During the 1971 provincial election, he encouraged Catholic residents of York—Forest Hill to support Liberal candidate Philip Givens, because of Givens' support for funding separate schools.
In January 1972, Marrese was selected without opposition as chairman of the Separate School Board. Following his selection, Marrese argued that the children of immigrants should start their education in their first language. He articulated an anti-abortion position on behalf of the board, and forwarded the board's correspondence on abortion with Premier Bill Davis to all Catholic hospitals in Ontario. Marrese was again returned without opposition in 1972 and 1974. His disputes with the Toronto Board of Education over school-sharing were frequently covered in the local media in this period. In early 1975, he was replaced as Separate School Board chairman by Joseph Grittani.
Provincial campaign.
He resigned from the school board to campaign as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1975 provincial election. He acknowledged that the Conservatives had been considered a "WASP party" in the past, but argued that this image was no longer accurate. He received 4,637 votes (24.63%), finishing third against New Democratic Party candidate Tony Grande in Oakwood.
Return to municipal politics.
Marrese ran for an aldermanic position in North York in the 1976 municipal election, and finished third against Mario Gentile in the city's second ward. During this election, there were allegations that representatives from the Marrese campaign tried to persuade Gentile and a third candidate to withdraw from the contest. Some speculated that the provincial Progressive Conservatives trying to influence the result of the election. Both Marrese and the Conservatives denied the charges.
Marrese was re-elected to the Metro Separate School Board in 1978, representing Ward Twenty-One in the Jane and Finch area. During the campaign, he argued that too many board decisions were made in private session and said he would work to ensure continued cooperation with the North York School Board. He was re-elected in 1980, and unsuccessfully challenged Paul Duggan for the chairmanship of the board in November 1981. In December 1981, Marrese argued that members of the North York Public School Board and the Metro Separate School Board should be appointed to North City's city planning board. He claimed this step was necessary to ensure the proper sale of school properties in later years.
Controversy and conviction.
Marrese's 1982 re-election bid was marked by two separate controversies. He was arrested on June 16, 1982 on charges of "breach of trust, and as a public official seeking to accept a reward and agreeing to vote for consideration" relating to the sale of the school board's former headquarters on Laird Drive. At around the same time, fellow trustee Antonio Signoroni suggested that Marrese may have been in a conflict-of-interest by voting to give school board contracts to his cousin Peter Caruso, a trustee on the North York Board of Education with whom Marrese shared an office. Marrese acknowledged that the contracts in question were awarded to Caruso, but denied any wrongdoing and said that he had never shown preference to his cousin. He questioned Signoroni's motives in raising the matter, noting that another of his relatives was challenging Signoroni in the 1982 election. Notwithstanding the controversies, Marrese was again re-elected for Ward Thirteen in the 1982 Toronto municipal election. Marrese's trial took place in late 1983. He was formally charged with one count of breach of trust and six counts of accepting a benefit. His accuser, John Lonergan, testified that Marrese approached him in June 1982 and "asked to be paid $30,000 for ensuring that the [separate school] board accepted a $1,925,000 offer". Marrese pleaded not guilty to all charges. His lawyer argued that Marrese had been set up by Lonergan, a charge that Lonergan denied.
The six acceptance charges against Marrese were dismissed on a legal technicality in mid-October 1983, when the judge ruled that a school trustee cannot be considered a municipal official. Defending himself against the remaining breach-of-trust charge, Marrese told the court that he had only agreed to make an improper financial arrangement with Lonergan to procure evidence that the realtor was trying to bribe him. He testified that he had been planning to take his evidence to the next board meeting in order "to reveal the bribe and vote against Lonergan's offer"; this course of action was, he added, made impossible by his arrest. In his closing remarks, the Crown council described Marrese's explanation as "unmitigated lies" and "nonsense". The judge agreed, describing Marrese's testimony as "untruthful" and "a total fabrication". Marrese was found guilty of breach-of-trust on November 7, 1983. Marrese's criminal conviction meant that he automatically lost his seat on the separate school board. Jack Graham, the board's acting chairman, described the conviction as the most embarrassing incident in the history of Catholic education in Ontario. On November 23, Marrese was stripped of his real estate license and sentenced to a year in prison. He was forced to resign from the Ontario Mortgage Corp. and the Ontario Land Corp. At the time of his arrest, Marrese served as director of the Toronto Columbus Lions Club, and vice-president of the Italian-Canadian Benevolent Fund.
Late career.
Marrese worked as a real estate broker following his release. In 1986, he made an unsuccessful bid to purchase the rights for property development on a North York city block surrounded by Yonge, Princess, Empress and Doris Streets. Marrese offered to pay $21 million for land valued at $10 million, an offer that North York Mayor Mel Lastman described as "ludicrous". He died on April 18, 2012, aged 90.

Sejfi Vllamasi

Sejfi Vllamasi (1883–1975) was an Albanian congressman and well-known politician during the first half of the 20th century. He was born in the village of Novoselë, in Kolonjë, Albania (at the time part of the Ottoman Empire).
Vllamasi studied in Istanbul, Turkey, to become a veterinary. His political activities started in 1905, as activist of the Secret Committee for the Liberation of Albania in Monastir. Vllamasi was one of the initiators of the Committee of Kosovo of 1918, founded in Shkoder. He was the initial leader of the Populist Party together with Pandeli Evangjeli and Eshref Frasheri. In April 1923 he was appointed Minister of Public Works. He took part in the June Revolution of 1924 to overthrow the rightist government. After the revolution was crushed, he migrated to Western Europe.
Vllamasi has been accused of participating in the anti-royalist movement during his exile in Vienna. He was a founding member of the "Bashkimi Kombetar" (National Union) organization, one of the organizations that collected many anti-Zog politicians in exile. Vllamasi was one of the organizers of the assassination attempt on Zogu in Vienna (1931). He was arrested by the Austrian police, released shortly after and deported from Austria. After that he moved to Paris along with most of the other diaspora activists.
During Nazi Germany's occupation, Vllamasi returned to Albania and became a member of the puppet government. He had an extremely difficult life during the communist rule of the Albanian Party of Labour, being imprisoned (1947–1956) and forced to work even in his old age.
Vllamasi's memoirs, titled "Ballafaqime politike në Shqipëri (1899–1942) (Political Confrontations in Albania (1899–1942))", reveal him to be an open critic of other personalities like Luigj Gurakuqi and some of the Kosovar irredentists, and even the line of action followed by Noli and the opposition of the early 1920s . His memoirs are a vast source of information on the politics of early 20th-century Albania and on many Albanian personalities of that time.

Luxembourg national cricket team

The Luxembourg national cricket team is the team that represents Luxembourg in international cricket. The Luxembourg Cricket Federation became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1998 and an associate member in 2017.
Ground.
Luxembourg's home ground is at the Pierre Werner Cricket Ground, in Walferdange which belongs to the country's largest club, the Optimists Cricket Club. The ground is named after the late Pierre Werner, a former Prime Minister of Luxembourg (1959–74, 1979–84). Werner had fallen in love with cricket when living in London in 1930, and went on to become the Honorary President of the OCC, which had been established when he was Prime Minister. Werner opened the OCC's new ground in 1992. Widely viewed as one of the best cricket grounds in mainland Europe (excluding grounds in the Netherlands), the ground lies in the picturesque setting just ten minutes from Luxembourg City center. It boasts a large outfield (with two tracks laid on different bases), four practice bays, a clubhouse with catering facilities, a cricket/tennis pavilion and various other amenities.
History.
Luxembourg men's international debut came at the 1990 European Cricketer Cup, a European Cricket Council tournament. Outside of occasional matches against Belgium, the team did not return to international level until 2003, when they finished last in the ECC Trophy, an eleven-team tournament for ICC affiliate members. The following year, they took part in the ECC Representative Championship in Slovenia, finishing in fifth place, nearly upsetting Croatia, and completing their first international win, against Bulgaria.
In 2006, Luxembourg took part in Division Four of the European Championship in Belgium, beating Finland, losing narrowly to Slovenia, and losing in the last over against Cyprus. Having narrowly missed out on promotion in 2006, they would play in Division Four again in 2009.
In 2009, Luxembourg again participated in Division Four of the ICC European Championship in Limassol, Cyprus. It won two games, against Slovenia and Finland, and lost three, finishing 4th out of six competing nations. The Luxembourg team won the Spirit of Cricket award.
In 2011, following a restructuring of the ICC European Divisions, Luxembourg participated in the ICC Europe Division 2 (T20) Championship, which took place in Belgium and involved 11 teams. Following a victory over Cyprus in the group stage, Luxembourg advanced to the 5th–8th place play-off where they eventually finished 8th. Belgium beat Austria in the final and both teams were promoted to ICC Europe Division 1.
2018-Present.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Luxembourg and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I. Luxembourg played their first T20I match against Turkey on 29 August 2019 during the 2019 Continental Cup in Romania.
Luxembourg women played as an international team for the first time in September 2021, in a friendly match against Belgium (who were preparing for a series of T20Is against Austria in Vienna). Playing at the Robert Schuman Oval in Évrange, Belgium scored 163 for 7 (Siofra Lawlor 2-24, Lydie Wykes-Templeman 2-30, Stella Wykes-Templeman 1-24). In reply Luxembourg scored 136 for 6, losing by 27 runs. Captain Kerry Fraser (15) and Lydie Wykes-Templeman (49) put on 118 for the second wicket. Lydie Wykes-Templeman went on to play T20Is for France in 2022.

Battery Garesche

Battery Garesche or Battery Garesché was a Union Army artillery battery built as part of the defenses of Washington, D.C. in the American Civil War at what is now Abingdon Street at South 30th Road in Fairlington, Arlington County, Virginia.
The battery was named after Lieutenant Colonel Julius P. Garesché who was killed on 31 December 1862 at the Battle of Stones River in Tennessee.
History.
It was constructed in late 1861 to control the high ground over Fort Reynolds, to the southeast, and to protect it from Confederate attack from positions on Seminary Ridge. 
It had a perimeter of and emplacements for 9 guns.
Although located in Virginia, a Confederate state, this was part of the area near Washington that was never controlled by Confederate forces.
The battery no longer exists and is now noted only with a historical marker.
Another Battery Garesché commemorated the deceased lieutenant colonel much later at Fort Williams, in Cape Elizabeth, Maine. 
It was a concrete shore battery which contained two disappearing 6-inch (155 mm) guns. 
Built in 1906, its armed existence was brief, as its guns were removed for use on the Western Front in World War I.

Fort Reynolds (Virginia)

Fort Reynolds was a Union Army redoubt built as part of the defenses of Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War.
The fort was located in Fairlington, Arlington County, Virginia. It was constructed in September 1861 to command the approach to Alexandria by the Four Mile Run valley and was itself protected by nearby Battery Garesche. It had a perimeter of 360 yards (329 m) and emplacements for 12 guns.
The fort was originally called Fort Blenker after Colonel Louis Blenker's brigade stationed nearby. In late 1863, the fort was renamed after Major General John F. Reynolds, who was killed on 1 July at the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania.
Occupation of Arlington.
Before the outbreak of the Civil War, Alexandria County (renamed Arlington County in 1920), the northernmost county in Virginia and the closest to Washington, D.C., was a predominantly rural area. Originally part of the District of Columbia, the land now comprising the county was retroceded to Virginia in a July 9, 1846 act of Congress that took effect in 1847. Most of the county is hilly, and at the time, most of the county's population was concentrated in the city of Alexandria, at the far southeastern corner of the county. In 1861, the rest of the county largely consisted of scattered farms, the occasional house, fields for grazing livestock, and Arlington House, owned by Mary Custis, wife of Robert E. Lee.
Following the surrender of Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 14, 1861, new American president Abraham Lincoln declared that "an insurrection existed," and called for 75,000 troops to be called up to quash the rebellion. The move sparked resentment in many other southern states, which promptly moved to convene discussions of secession. The Virginia State Convention passed "an ordinance of secession" and ordered a May 23 referendum to decide whether or not the state should secede from the Union. The U.S. Army responded by creating the Department of Washington, which united all Union troops in the District of Columbia and Maryland under one command.
Brigadier General J.F.K. Mansfield, commander of the Department of Washington, argued that Northern Virginia should be occupied as soon as possible in order to prevent the possibility of the Confederate Army mounting artillery on the hills of Arlington and shelling government buildings in Washington. He also urged the erection of fortifications on the Virginia side of the Potomac River to protect the southern terminuses of the Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge. His superiors approved these recommendations, but decided to wait until after Virginia voted for or against secession.
On May 23, 1861, Virginia voted by a margin of 3 to 1 in favor of leaving the Union. That night, U.S. Army troops began crossing the bridges linking Washington, D.C. to Virginia. The march, which began at 10 p.m. on the night of the 23rd, was described in colorful terms by the New York Herald two days later:
There can be no more complaints of inactivity of the government. The forward march movement into Virginia, indicated in my despatches last night, took place at the precise time this morning that I named, but in much more imposing and powerful numbers.
About ten o'clock last night four companies of picked men moved over the Long Bridge, as an advance guard. They were sent to reconnoitre, and if assailed were ordered to signal, when they would have been reinforced by a corps of regular infantry and a battery...
At twelve o'clock the infantry regiment, artillery and cavalry corps began to muster and assume marching order. As fast as the several regiments were ready they proceeded to the Long Bridge, those in Washington being directed to take that route.
The troops quartered at Georgetown, the Sixty-ninth, Fifth, Eighth and Twenty-eighth New York regiments, proceeded across what is known as the chain bridge, above the mouth of the Potomac Aqueduct, under the command of General McDowell. They took possession of the heights in that direction.
The imposing scene was at the Long Bridge, where the main body of the troops crossed. Eight thousand infantry, two regular cavalry companies and two sections of Sherman's artillery battalion, consisting of two batteries, were in line this side of the Long Bridge at two o'clock.
The occupation of Northern Virginia was peaceful, with the sole exception of the town of Alexandria. There, as Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth, commander of the New York Fire Zouaves (11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment), entered a local hotel to remove the Confederate flag flying above it, he was shot and killed by James Jackson, the proprietor. Ellsworth was one of the first men killed in the American Civil War. Throughout the remainder of the war, Alexandria would lean strongly towards the Confederate government, necessitating continued occupation by a Union garrison.
Battle of Bull Run.
Over the seven weeks that followed the occupation of northern Virginia, forts were constructed along the banks of the Potomac River and at the approaches to each of the three major bridges (Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge) connecting Virginia to Washington and Georgetown.
While the Potomac River forts were being built, planning and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts to protect the city. Unlike the fortifications under construction, the new forts would defend the city in all directions, not just the most direct route through Arlington. In mid-July, this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run. As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas, the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle. In the days that followed the Union defeat at Bull Run, panicked efforts were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. The makeshift trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington.
On July 26, 1861, five days after the battle, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was named commander of the military district of Washington and the subsequently renamed Army of the Potomac. Upon arriving in Washington, McClellan was appalled by the condition of the city's defenses.
In no quarter were the dispositions for defense such as to offer a vigorous resistance to a respectable body of the enemy, either in the position and numbers of the troops or the number and character of the defensive works... not a single defensive work had been commenced on the Maryland side. There was nothing to prevent the enemy shelling the city from heights within easy range, which could be occupied by a hostile column almost without resistance.
To remedy the situation, one of McClellan's first orders upon taking command was to greatly expand the defenses of Washington. At all points of the compass, forts and entrenchments would be constructed in sufficient strength to defeat any attack. Alexandria, which contained the southern terminus of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and one of the largest ports in the Chesapeake Bay, was an object of "anxious study."
Planning and construction.
Gen. John Newton, who was in charge of the forts south of Four Mile Run, supervised the construction and managed the flow of men and material.
Fort Blenker was built by the troops of Gen. Louis Blenker, to the North of Fort Ward across the Leesburg and Alexandria Turnpike, now Route 7.
On Friday January 17, 1862, Col. J. Howard Kitching marched with the 6th New York Artillery to occupy the Fort, and complete construction,
Fort Blenker, January 19, 1862.
... On Friday morning, while we were all hard at work in Fort Worth, Major Doull received orders to march, immediately to this post with two companies. In less than two hours' time, we had torn down our nice winter quarters, which we had built with so much trouble; left our nice log cook-houses and stables, and were on the march; I, in command of the troops, Doull having gone ahead to arrange for our relieving the troops at Blenker.
It had a perimeter of 360 yards, and places for 12 guns.
In 1954, the fort was demolished to construct an apartment complex. It still lends its name to nearby Fort Reynolds Park and is noted with a historical marker.

Émilie Mondor

Émilie Mondor (April 29, 1981 – September 9, 2006) was a Canadian Olympic athlete, who was a two-time national champion in the women's 5,000 metres.
Early life.
She was born in Mascouche, Quebec in 1981. Mondor studied at McGill University, later moving to Simon Fraser University to study and train. She had a promising performance at the 1998 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, finishing tenth in the junior race at the age of sixteen. She did not build on these performances, however, and she finished some minutes behind the leaders at the 1999 and 2000 world junior races.
Career.
Mondor won the Fukuoka International Cross Country in March 2003 with a time of 18:51 – one of the fastest recorded on the course. A twelfth-place finish at the 2003 IAAF World Cross Country Championships confirmed her one of the better cross country runners of her generation. She finished twelfth in 5000 metres at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics, and near the close of the season she became the first Canadian woman to dip under 15:00 in the 5000 m. She improved further in cross country the following year, finishing in eighth in the long race at the 2004 IAAF World Cross Country Championships and thirteenth in the short race at the same competition.
She began to take up road running and won the Vancouver Sun Run in early 2004. At the 2004 Summer Olympics she finished seventeenth overall in the 5000 m. She also won the Belfast International Cross Country that year. She was the most successful athlete in the history of the North American 5K Championships, coming runner-up in 2002, then winning three straight titles in the following years.
Mondor was unable to compete for much of 2005 and 2006 due to a rare medical condition affecting the strength of her bones. After drug treatments for the condition, she placed second in a 10 kilometre road race held in Toronto on May 7, 2006.
Death.
She died in a car accident on Highway 417 near Hawkesbury, Ontario. According to the Ontario Provincial Police, Ms. Mondor lost control of her car after passing two other vehicles.

EJ DiMera

EJ DiMera is a fictional character from "Days of Our Lives", an American soap opera on the NBC network. Created by head writer James E. Reilly and introduced under executive producers, Ken Corday and Tom Langan, EJ is the son of crime boss Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) and the eccentric Susan Banks (Eileen Davidson). Initially portrayed by child actors Avalon, Dillon, and Vincent Ragone from February 1997 to April 1998, the character was rapidly aged in 2006 when James Scott was cast in the role; he departed the role in October 2014. In 2018, the role was briefly portrayed by Trey Baxter. In June 2021, Australian actor Dan Feuerriegel assumed the role.
Upon the character's 2006 re-introduction, EJ is immediately taken with Sami Brady (Alison Sweeney), with the pairing becoming one of the most popular and controversial couples in recent history, with the controversy stemming from EJ raping Sami in exchange for his help in saving the life of her longtime love, Lucas Horton. This rape also produces their son, Johnny. The couple's first marriage is for convenience, allowing EJ to stay in the country when he begins having problems with immigration. EJ also has a chaotic relationship with Sami's nemesis, Nicole Walker. EJ and Sami's relationship is also rivaled by Sami's relationship with Rafe Hernandez. EJ reunites with Sami but presumably dies after being shot by his disloyal bodyguard hired by rival Clyde Weston. However, Kristen revealed in 2017 that EJ was alive, and Susan and Sami were reunited with him the following year. EJ then returned to Salem in June 2021.
Scott's performance in the role garnered him two consecutive Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2010 and 2011.
Creation.
Background.
According to former "Days" writer Kola Boof, she also helped create the role of EJ Wells and decided to cast Scott in the role. Boof titled her initial character bible for EJ Wells as "The Devil Finds Work." Boof revealed to Nelson Branco of "TV Guide" that EJ initially comes to town to avenge his mother, Susan (Eileen Davidson), who by that time had been in a mental institution. Eileen Davidson was set to reprise the role for a few episodes slated to air in the fall. However, the planned story was abandoned when Boof was fired from the writing team. The character was always meant to be a race car driver, but following Boof's firing, his racer career was also forgotten, and he was written as a lawyer.
The majority of EJ's childhood is spent with a nanny whom he refers to as his governess, whom he compares to Mary Poppins. EJ begins attending boarding schools at a very young age. EJ is a fan of Jazz music. EJ attends Eton College along with Duke of Cambridge, Prince William (revising his birth year to 1982) and even serviced his car at one point. EJ later attends Oxford University. During this time, EJ is in a long-term romance with another woman, and they graduate from Oxford together. However, she wants to pursue a career while EJ is allowed to compete in the European racing circuit. He asks her to come with him, but she refuses, and they go their separate ways. EJ then dedicates himself to racing and becomes known worldwide for his skill. After college, EJ works in Cairo doing import and export work and also lives in India for a while. EJ also has experience as a bartender. He spends a lot of time in Monte Carlo as a race car driver.
Casting.
In May 2006, it was announced that Scott, previously known for his controversial role as Ethan Cambias on "All My Children" was slated to join the cast of "Days" in the role of E.J. The character's surname remained secret to keep his connections to other characters on canvas a secret. Scott filmed his first scenes on May 3 and debuted on May 30, 2006. Kola Boof revealed that Justin Hartley, formerly of "Passions" was also considered for the role. After Scott's character was killed off of "All My Children", Scott stayed in New York City until the end of the pilot season when he was contacted by the casting department from "Days". They told Scott that he would fit in the role of EJ. However, Scott was still under contract with ABC at the time. Scott asked to be released from his contract, and the network agreed. In February 2009, Scott revealed that he re-signed with the series for another two years. In December 2010, Scott revealed that he was considering branching out into other mediums and hinted at the possibility of retiring from acting. In late September 2011, "Soap Opera Digest" revealed that James would depart the series when his contract expired. However, negotiations continued shortly after the news broke about Scott's potential departure. James issued the following statement: "It has always been my wish to continue working with Days of our Lives, and in light of recent reassurances given, I am optimistic of my future here at Days." Deanna Barnert speculated that the recent reboot of the series, which included bringing back several popular veteran characters was in preparation of Scott's potential departure. On October 5, it was confirmed that Scott had re-signed with the series for another year, with his contract set to expire in April 2013. Scott later extended his stay for another year. On May 2, 2014, "Soap Opera Digest" confirmed that Scott had wrapped filming and would exit the series screen sometime in the fall. In a May 2020 interview with "Soap Opera Digest", Paul Telfer revealed he had previously been hired as a one-week stand-by, due to an undisclosed health issue by James. Telfer later joined the cast as Xander Kiriakis in 2015.
On March 31, 2021, "Daytime Confidential" reported that Australian actor Dan Feuerriegel had been cast in the role. Two months later, "Deadline Hollywood" announced Feuerriegel's casting; he made his first episodic appearance during the final moments of the June 9, 2021, episode.
Characterization.
Before his debut, Scott revealed some similarities between his new character and his former alter ego, Ethan Cambias. The only thing Scott was told about his character was that he was a race car driver. Though it does not entirely define the character, it does affect who EJ is. EJ is not easily affected by everyday life because he is used to operating in high-pressure situations, such as racing. Whenever his life is in danger and he is forced to make a decision, it puts EJ at "ease." Scott was allowed to use his natural British accent in his portrayal of EJ. In 2008, "BuddyTV" referred to the character as a "dashing" anti-hero because he is a "good guy" and a "bad guy" all in one. EJ, like any other person, has a dark side to him. In 2011, Deanna Barnert described the character as "nefarious."
Storylines.
1997–1998.
Elvis John Banks was born to Stefano DiMera and Susan Banks (Eileen Davidson) on February 21, 1997. At the time, Susan, a Kristen Blake (also Davidson) look alike, was paid to give birth to a baby that would then be adopted by Kristen, unbeknownst to John Black, Kristen's fiancée. Susan realizes Kristen is deceptive and cruel, while John is loving and noble. As the birth mother of the child that Kristen and John claimed as theirs, Susan planned to take Kristen's place at John's side and in his bed. Marlena Evans, however, managed to foil the plans of both Kristen and Susan; Marlena and John reunited, and Susan was content to find love with Edmund Crumb then. Salemites believed that EJ was then raised by Susan and Edmund, who moved to the United Kingdom. Stefano, however, managed to snatch EJ from Susan, raising him at "Maison Blanche" in New Orleans and sending him to British boarding schools.
2006–2014.
EJ Wells first appears as Sami Brady’s handsome new neighbor across the hall. The growing chemistry between him and Samantha stopped abruptly as EJ was soon revealed to be the mysterious figure attacking Sami's family and his connection to Stefano was also discovered. In December 2006, EJ held Sami at gunpoint and forced her to help him through the police roadblocks set up by Salem PD to keep him from leaving the country after he shot John Black. After Sami got him through the roadblocks, EJ told her to leave the car. Sami refused and said that since she had helped him, he must have helped her save Lucas Horton's life. EJ agrees to help her only if she has sex with him in exchange for saving Lucas; EJ then rapes Sami. Afterward, he helped Sami get a beam off, leaving them to die in the snow with no way out. EJ brainwashed Steve Johnson and forced him to kidnap a comatose John Black and transplant one of his kidneys into a dying Stefano. When Sami learned she was pregnant, Celeste Perrault revealed that EJ was the child's father but warned him that Stefano would disapprove. His brother, Tony DiMera, convinced him to kidnap Sami and harvest the stem cells from the unborn child to save Stefano's life. EJ changed his mind and helped Sami escape at the last minute. Sami later learned she was carrying twins, and Stefano ordered them to marry so they could end the feud between the Brady and DiMera families once and for all. Sami welcomed her twins in October 2007. It turned out that Lucas fathered the little girl, Allie, and EJ fathered the little boy, Johnny. After John was killed in a hit-and-run accident, Sami married EJ in November 2007, blackmailed by Stefano and EJ and against her will, but he was shot at the altar by Lucas (it was later that we found that Will, Lucas' son, was the one that shot EJ.) EJ promised to change and become an excellent example for the twins. At the same time, Lucas was arrested for EJ's shooting. Later, Sami's mother, Marlena Evans, gave him a chance to redeem himself by bringing down his father. EJ knew that a brainwashed John Black was in the basement of the DiMera mansion and decided to reunite him with his family in January 2008. EJ and Sami moved into a safe house to stay safe from Stefano, where they bonded over raising the twins. They planned to have the marriage annulled, but the death of Sami's grandpa, Shawn, forced them to put it off. When they finally got another chance, EJ put it off by pretending that his visa had expired, and Sami agreed to prolong the marriage until he could deal with immigration. EJ began representing Nicole Walker during her divorce from Victor Kiriakis. Meanwhile, EJ and Sami made love for the first time in May 2008, just in time for Lucas to be released from prison and catch them in bed. Sami discovered EJ's ploy to stay married to her by bribing the immigration agent, and their annulment was finalized soon after.
In July 2008, EJ and Nicole got trapped in an elevator together and ended up having sex. Nicole learned she was pregnant but hid it when she had a miscarriage. Nicole also knew Sami was pregnant by EJ and planned to keep it from him. Nicole faked her pregnancy and took teenage Mia McCormick's child for her and EJ to raise. However, she later switched Mia's baby with Sami's baby: she and EJ named EJ's and Sami's daughter, Sydney Anne. When Sami returned home from the Witness Protection Program, she claimed to have adopted baby Grace. EJ and Nicole married in April 2009. Tony DIMera, EJ's brother, would die after getting into a fight with Philip Kiriakis. EJ blamed Philip for Tony's death and wanted revenge; this would lead to a war with Philip Kiriakis and his father, Victor. A feud between DIMeras and Kiriakis started, but they called a truce in the end.
EJ was devastated after Grace died in June 2009, and Sami told him that he was the child's father. EJ became furious with Sami for keeping EJ from his child. EJ felt hurt and betrayed by Sami for lying to him. EJ was heartbroken and grieved over the loss of his daughter. For months, EJ would be angry with Sami while being in pain over losing Grace and never knowing his daughter. Despite being furious, EJ was still in love with Sami and hurt over the fact that she lied and kept from his daughter, didn't trust him, and tried to pass Rafe Hernandez off as the father. However, EJ later would start suspecting Nicole was keeping something from him. EJ sent someone to spy on Nicole to get information. EJ learned that Nicole had a miscarriage, and he kicked her and Sydney out of the mansion. But EJ didn't know Sydney was his natural daughter, not Grace. EJ personally would change over the years: he would grow more and more angry, more ruthless, more aggressive, colder, and more calculating as time went by. EJ saved Rafe Hernandez's life after one of Stefano's men tried to kill Rafe, but EJ put a stop to it. Rafe later revealed that Nicole switched the babies and Sydney was EJ and Sami's child. EJ and Sami reunited with Sydney; EJ and Sami would call a truce. EJ later realized that Stefano had assisted Nicole with her schemes. EJ took all his anger and rage out on Stefano by choking him; EJ severed ties with Stefano again.
In December 2009, Nicole attempted to kidnap Sydney and skip town. This brought EJ and Sami closer as they shared a moment over Sydney. EJ, Sami, and Rafe worked together to get Sydney back. Still, someone else stole Sydney from Nicole. EJ and Sami united to try to find Sydney, but EJ overheard Sami saying that she wished EJ wasn't in the picture, that Rafe was Sydney's father and that she and Rafe could raise Sydney together. After hearing this, EJ became furious with Sami.
It was revealed that EJ had kidnapped Sydney and faked her death as revenge on Sami for keeping the child a secret and breaking up her and Rafe. His sister-in-law, Anna DiMera, was his accomplice. EJ was seen as the "hero" when he suddenly brought Sydney back home, and he and Sami became close again. EJ realized later that he was still in love with Sami and felt guilty over what he had done. EJ and Sami become closer, and EJ confesses his love for Sami and later asks her to marry him, which she eventually accepts.
In August 2010, as they prepare to marry, Rafe reveals EJ's schemes, and Sami walks out on him. Sami shoots a drunken EJ in the head and leaves him for dead. EJ wakes up from a coma believing he and Sami got married, but the truth is that she is now married to Rafe. Rafe's sister, Arianna, found proof that Sami shot EJ, but she was killed in an accident before she could get it to him. However, EJ received Arianna's proof from Nicole. EJ blackmails Sami to give him full custody of Johnny and Sydney. EJ asked Nicole to marry him so he could get back at Sami by making Nicole the children's stepmother. When it was learned Johnny had eye cancer, EJ and Sami put their problems behind them. EJ made a deal with God to let Johnny keep his eyes, and he would let Sami be part of Johnny's and Sydney's lives. Stefano also revealed to EJ and his sister, Lexie Carver, that they have another brother, Chad Woods, the biological father of baby Grace.
EJ and Nicole married in February 2011. EJ schemes to take Rafe out of the picture, and Stefano comes up with a plan to replace Rafe with someone else, hiring convict Arnold Feniger and giving him plastic surgery to make him identical to Rafe. In the meantime, Nicole's sister, Taylor, arrives, and she and EJ are instantly attracted to each other. Shortly after the wedding, EJ and Taylor begin having an affair. After Nicole and Taylor's mother, Fay, has a heart attack, EJ comforts them and allows Fay to stay at the mansion. Nicole soon learns about the affair and blackmails EJ with what he and his father did to Rafe. EJ asks Taylor to marry him, and she accepts. The truth about the fake Rafe comes out, and Taylor dumps EJ because Arnold killed her mother by pushing her down the stairs when she confronted Arnold about the truth. Arnold decides to testify against EJ and Stefano, but Arnold is killed by other inmates in prison, and EJ and Stefano go free.
EJ decided to run for mayor against his brother-in-law Abe Carver; feeling lonely, he asks Nicole to serve as his campaign manager and convinces her to hold off their divorce. EJ and Nicole became closer during the campaign and had sex. However, to EJ's dismay, Nicole decided to go through with the divorce. Later, EJ revealed he framed John Black for corporate embezzlement and used this to his advantage during campaign season. Johnny goes missing when the Brady family gathers at the Pub before John's trial. EJ and Sami are devastated when a news report claims that Johnny is dead, and to cope with the pain, they end up having sex. They find out that Johnny is not dead and is with Rafe. Nicole told EJ she wanted to give them another chance, and EJ and Nicole reunited. EJ and Sami agreed to keep what happened between them a secret. Sami's son, Will, discovered them and tried to blackmail EJ to help him leave town. EJ turns the tables on Will and reveals that he knows it was Will, not Lucas, who shot him during his wedding to Sami in 2007. He then forced Will to work for him. However, EJ gave Will a race car and agreed to pay Will to work for him. Will agreed and enjoyed his new job with EJ. Will stole Abe's campaign information and handed it over to EJ. EJ won the election. However, the evening was interrupted when Rafe revealed that he found out about Sami and EJ's one-night stand. Nicole left EJ when Rafe broke up with Sami. EJ tried to win back Nicole, but Nicole wanted a reconciliation only if EJ left Salem with her and abandoned his children with Sami. EJ bought Sami an apartment while learning Nicole was pregnant, but Rafe lied and said he was the father of Nicole's baby. EJ didn't believe Rafe was the father and wanted a DNA test to prove the father's identity. Daniel Jones switched the test results; however, even after, EJ still didn't believe that Rafe was the father of his and Nicole's baby.
In early 2012, Nicole reveals to EJ that it was Stefano who attempted to cost him the election; EJ finds out Stefano stole money that he stole from John. Later, he learns from Billie Reed that Stefano destroyed his case against John Black by helping clear his name. Adding more, the family is devastated when Lexie reveals that she is dying from a brain tumor. It shows that when Andre held Lexie in the tunnels, she got a brain tumor. EJ blamed Stefano because Andre worked for him. However, Stefano claims he had nothing to do with it. But this only added to the heat between EJ and Stefano. This all would lead to EJ holding Stefano up at gunpoint, planning to kill him. However, EJ couldn't do it, so he left; however, Stefano was shot in cold blood. EJ became the prime suspect in Stefano's murder and was framed by Ian McAllister. EJ is devastated when Lexie dies from a brain tumor. EJ and Sami grow closer and reconnect; Sami helps EJ prove his innocence. EJ and Sami had no choice but to run to clear EJ's name; however, an explosion happened. Sami saves Ej from the Salem cops, ready to shoot him. The big blast happens in Salem, and Sami almost dies, but EJ can save her with help from the Will. EJ and Sami go to a safe house that belongs to Stefano; EJ and Sami get closer and end up kissing. However, EJ has to find Ian McAllister to confront him, but EJ walks right into a trap set. EJ was Held captive By Ian and Came face to face with Stefano. Ian reveals that Stefano and EJ are, in fact, biological father and son.
Later, EJ got free and took down Ian. Afterward, EJ told Stefano off and said he wanted nothing to do with him. EJ returns to the safe house only to find Sami with Rafe, who arrests both EJ and Sami, but later, EJ and Sami get out of jail. In August 2012, EJ and Sami the two give in to their feelings by kissing, but EJ is discouraged when Sami reveals that she doesn't want to jump into things and want to focus on her work and kids. Sami decides to give EJ a chance. However, Rafe reenters the picture and Sami's life as she begins interacting with him. Rafe tells Sami that EJ is no good for her and kisses Sami, which causes her to end things with EJ. EJ becomes angry and confronts Rafe; EJ heads butt Rafe, and the two end up getting into a fight. However, John and Lucas break it up; EJ decides to get back at Rafe to win Sami back and prove that EJ is the father of Nicole's baby. EJ finds out from Chad that Rafe's sister, Gabi, was behind Melanie's kidnapping. EJ uses this to blackmail Rafe and stay away from Sami; Rafe lets EJ be with Sami, but Sami learns the truth from Chad, gets mad at EJ, and reunites with Rafe. However, EJ got proof that he was the father of Nicole's child but came to find out his son was dead. EJ is heartbroken and grief over the death of his son. However, EJ gets Nicole to confess that Rafe wasn't the father and the baby was their child. EJ records Nicole's confession and confronts both Rafe and Sami, revealing to Sami that Rafe was lying about being the father of Nicole's baby by play records. Sami breaks up with Rafe. EJ decides not to go after Nicole, Daniel, and Rafe; he is shocked by the return of his adopted step-sister, Kristen Blake DiMera. EJ wants to win back Sami, and Kristen reveals that she is working with Sami. Kristen quits her job and gives it to EJ so that he can work with Sami and be closer to her. Sami still loves Rafe, but Sami still has feelings for EJ. EJ and Sami grow closer while working together, and EJ becomes closer to Sami. EJ talks with Caroline Brady; Caroline tells EJ that Sami loves Rafe and EJ and says that maybe EJ can change. After speaking with Caroline, EJ decides to become a better man for Sami. EJ spends Christmas Day and New Year's Eve with her. EJ kisses Sami three times on New Year's Eve, but Rafe kisses Sami. Kate tells EJ that he could lose, once more, to Rafe in the battle for Sami's heart. Sami was going to tell EJ she was getting back together with Rafe, but EJ confessed his love for Sami by telling Sami he loved her and that EJ was in love with her. Sami was speechless, but she still planned to tell EJ.
Sami plans Gabi's wedding to Nick Fallon, which ends when Will reveals that he is the father of Gabi's unborn baby, not Nick. This causes a big fight between Rafe and Sami; this causes her to run into EJ's arms. EJ was there for Sami during Will's custody battle with Nick and Gabi. However, Rafe told EJ that Sami was going to choose Rafe over EJ; EJ was upset about this and went to Sami and confronted her about it. Sami told EJ everything; however, she said she didn't want to throw EJ away, confessed her genuine love for him, and admitted she wanted to be with EJ. EJ took all it in at once and forgave her. EJ and Sami reunite, and later, Sami tells EJ she loves and trusts him. Nick blackmails Will into giving up the rights to his unborn daughter with the information that Will shot EJ in 2007.
 Sami asks for EJ's help in getting rid of Nick. Desperate, the two turn to Stefano for help removing the evidence against Will. EJ proposes to Sami in April 2013, and she accepts. Meanwhile, it's revealed that EJ still holds a grudge against Stefano for disowning him as his son, and is seeking revenge by taking DiMera Enterprises from his father. To this end, he enlists the help of Justin Kiriakis to take Stefano down.
Rafe is viciously attacked, and the police and Sami suspect EJ. However, Sami later realizes EJ wasn't responsible. Will saves Nick and Gabi when they are kidnapped by the attacker, Jensen. Will is shot trying to save Nick, while Gabi gives birth to Arianna Grace. EJ comes to the hospital to support Sami while Will is in surgery, and she meets her granddaughter. While there, she also visits Rafe. During a visit, Sami spots a man with a knife at Rafe's bedside and shoots him. EJ later finds out that the man is a corrupt police officer on Stefano's payroll. Though Sami insists the officer was holding a knife, and EJ believes her, the police are not able to find the weapon, and Sami is arrested for the murder of a police officer.
During the trial for Officer Bernardi, to get Samantha out of jail, Ej has to beg his father and gravels to release Samantha. Stefano was the one who set up Sami with Bernardi's murder; an ex-mistress killed the officer, and Stefano framed Sami to control Ej. Like Stefano, he planned to make EJ give back the business to Justin, which he had taken from his father. Also, he had to resign everything back to his father and promise not to leave the mansion ever, even with Samantha and the children. Ej and Sami are happy living at the Dimera mansion, but they must put up with Stefano, who lives under the same roof as them and their children. They get engaged; however, during the engagement party, Bernardi's widow tries to take revenge on Sami and Ej by shooting Ej. Chad7 tries to protect Ej and gets the bullet at his place; he is injured and has to leave Salem with Stefano to get nursed.
EJ then is also caught in another cover-up, the rape of Sami's twin brother Eric by his adopted sister Kristen. He discovers on Kristen's wedding day that she drugged and raped Eric; at first, he is horrified, but then he lets Kristen convince him to cover it in the name of the Dimera family's loyalty. After Kristen is discovered at her wedding, she runs away. However, thanks to a phone text from Kristen to Ej, Sami finds out Ej covered up for Kristen; Ej pretends to Samantha's face he knows nothing about the rape part, that Kristen said it was consensual because he felt torn between his loyalty to his family and his love for Sami. He's tired of Sami's antics and the fact that she doesn't appreciate him more by putting her family above him. He told her he didn't care about her brother but only her. Samantha's trust in Ej is shattered during this time because of his behavior concerning his cover-up for his half-sister Kristen's crimes. As a result, she refuses to make any plans for marriage or a future with EJ despite stating her love for him. He is also banned from Samantha's bedroom. EJ becomes very frustrated when Sami wants to put their relationship on hold.
EJ helps cover the murder that Gabi, Sami, and Kate did to Nick. EJ hired a special team to clean the scene and is always in the corner of Samantha, the love of his life. However, there were still problems between EJ and Sami, which led to fights between the two, which caused more problems, and Sami continued to reject any physical intimacy from Ej. EJ goes to Smith Island and stops Abigail Deveraux from talking to Hope about Nick after Gabi tells him Abby will speak with Hope. EJ speeds off on his private boat and Abby and EJ talk. EJ tries to get Abby not to tell Hope about Nick. Abby believes EJ is having an affair with Gabi, but EJ says that is not true; Abby goes on and says any woman wants to sleep with him. EJ realizes Abby's attraction to him. Knowing this, EJ uses it to stop Abby by kissing her when she is about to go to Hope. EJ stops the kiss and tries to leave Smith Island. However, Abby stops EJ from leaving. She kisses him, and then they begin having sex. After that, Abigail starts to chase Ej at every opportunity. EJ tries several times to reject Abby, but she uses what she thinks happened about Nick's disappearance to get close to Ej and to have a sexual relationship with him. Several times, EJ confronts Abby and tries to get her not to tell anyone. However, Abby tries to blackmail EJ by saying She will tell Hope everything if EJ doesn't give her what she wants. EJ and Abby kiss and almost have sex at the hospital where Abby is working. EJ is on the board as one of the backers but stops when someone nearly comes in. After that, Abigail chases Ej at the gym locker room of his Dimera company, and they have sex in the shower until they hear Sami, and Ej stops the act immediately. 
Ej and Sami began to slowly reconcile, and once again, Ej tried to persuade Abigail to stop pursuing him and move on. Finally, once and for all, he rejected her.
Sami and EJ would reconcile on Valentine's Day; EJ and Sami kiss. Later, The two would rekindle their love and passionately make love. EJ moves forward with his wedding to Sami. However, One day, a picture of them kissing at the Horton cabin arrives at the DiMera mansion. EJ hides it from Sami and immediately tries to locate the photographer. After a small investigation, EJ discovers that the photographer was Nick Fallon's assistant, Percy Ruggles. This causes EJ to go after Nick, who first confronts Percy, threatens him to give him the pictures to destroy, and sends him back to England. EJ warns Nick if he tries to ruin his family and tells Sami about the affair, Nick will be sorry. EJ hires a hitman to kill Nick, and Sami agrees to follow EJ's plan. When Nick was shot, this put EJ and Sami on the list of suspects. It was later revealed that their hitman wasn't the one who killed him. Sami and EJ proceed with their wedding, and Sami asks Abigail to be her Maid of honor. While planning her wedding, Sami comes across the photo of Abigail and EJ. She becomes furious but pushes forward with the wedding; after the ceremony, Rafe Hernandez shows up and arrests EJ for tax evasion. While in jail, EJ signs his proxies to Sami so she can go to a board meeting in place of him. Sami attends the board meeting with Kate Roberts (who got Stefano to sign over his proxies to her) and is voted in as DiMera Enterprise's new Co-CEOs. Sami presents this information to a furious EJ and reveals to him that she was the one who gave the police the evidence for his tax evasion arrest. When EJ asked why she was doing this, she revealed that she knew about his hook-up with Abigail and would make him pay. EJ tries to get through to Sami and repeatedly begs for her forgiveness. However, Sami refuses to forgive EJ, but EJ doesn't give up on Sami. To get back the money Sami and Kate stole from Stefano, EJ also negotiates with Victor and takes his drug business, but he is faced with a competitor in newly arrived Clyde Weston, who seems friendly and offers a partnership but wants to take over EJ's territory. Kristen returns to Salem after he kidnaps Daniel; Kristen is locked up and asks EJ for help. However, EJ turns down Kristen and refuses to help her. Later, the affair between EJ and Abby became public Will, which brought EJ and Sami together. Sami asks for EJ's help; however, EJ walks out on Sami, but later, EJ agrees to help if Sami goes out with him to lunch, and Sami agrees. EJ would help Sami win Sami back, and the two became closer again. However, Stefano's return to Salem shakes things up for Sami and Kate.
However, EJ gave Rafe documents on Stefano that hindered his return to Salem to protect Sami and win her back. EJ and Sami eventually reconcile. Sami forgives EJ, and they reunite. EJ and Sami enjoy their happiness. However, EJ's mother Susan Banks returns to Salem and warns EJ his life is in danger. To get revenge on EJ, EJ's brother Chad informs Stefano that EJ helped the Salem Police keep him out of Salem. Stefano angrily disowns EJ, saying he's dead to him. A furious EJ confronts Chad for revealing his betrayal to Stefano, warning Chad that he's unleashing a bitter and vindictive Stefano on EJ, Sami, and their children. Johnny tells EJ the kids at school are teasing him because he's a DiMera; EJ tells Johnny that as he gets older, he'll hear many things about the DiMera family, but it's a name to be proud of. EJ has a confrontation with Clyde over Salem's drug territory and is betrayed, shot, and killed by his disloyal bodyguard, Miguel. Stefano has EJ's sister Kristen inject an unknown substance into EJ's body in the morgue for an unknown reason, saying only that "time is of the essence."
EJ's death causes Sami and her kids to leave Salem and move to Los Angeles, California.
2015–2018.
In 2015, there were signs that EJ was still alive; Sami got a letter from EJ saying that if he were dead, then Stefano was the cause. The letter was over a year old and contained nothing about Clyde Weston. Sami states that EJ wrote things only she and EJ knew, and the letter instructed Sami to get the codes that drained all of Stefano's money from his secret accounts.
When EJ's sister Kristen (Stacy Haiduk) returns to Salem in August 2018 for John and Marlena's wedding, she reveals that EJ is alive and offers to tell Sami where he is, provided she shoots John. In September 2018, Kristen revealed to Stefan DiMera (Tyler Christopher) details about EJ being alive. Sami agrees to transfer funds he needs to sustain losses suffered by DiMera Enterprises in return for the information about EJ's whereabouts. Stefan reveals to Sami that under Stefano's instructions, Kristen injected EJ with a drug that kept him alive, sneaking him out of the hospital and that Stefano had Sami believe EJ was dead and that EJ's body was never cremated. While Sami grieved EJ's "death," Kristen delivered EJ to Stefano. Stefan tells Sami that EJ is recovering at a private facility. When Brady Black (Eric Martsolf) sneaks into the facility, he finds Xander Kiriakis working with Kristen on a secret project that is revealed to be EJ's recovery. There, it is revealed that EJ's recovery is not as easy as intended, with him losing his ability to speak.
Reception.
Scott's performance earned him a Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2010 and 2011. In 2020, Charlie Mason from "Soaps She Knows" placed EJ 11th on his list of the 35 most memorable characters from "Days of Our Lives", commenting that "When James Scott's spawn of Stefano blackmailed No. 4 [Sami Brady] into shagging him, that should've been the end of our — all of our — infatuation with him. Instead, it was just another chapter of a story that we couldn't wait to finish — and don't want to believe has been ended."

Gerrit Hendrik Kersten

Gerrit Hendrik Kersten (6 August 1882 – 6 September 1948) was a Dutch Calvinist minister and politician. After briefly working as a primary school teacher Kersten was inducted into his first pastorate in Meliskerke in 1905 without formal theological training. In 1907 Kersten was instrumental in achieving a union of two groups of disparate, low-church groups of small secessional congregations, resulting in the formation of the Reformed Congregations. Eleven years later, in 1918, he established the Reformed Political Party to realize his vision of "a Calvinist Netherlands ruled on a biblical basis without cinema, sports, vaccination and social security". He was the party's first member of the House of Representatives, being elected in 1922. He would remain in parliament until his debarment in 1945.
On the evening of 10 November 1925, Kersten, ever opposed to Catholicism, proposed an amendment to the 1926 budget for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Kersten's proposal would result in ending financial support for a Dutch diplomatic office at the Holy See. The amendment was adopted the next day with support from one of the government parties Christian Historical Union, which in turn led to the resignation of four Catholic government ministers and the fall of the first coalition government of Hendrik Colijn. The fall of the first Colijn cabinet after only three months became known as the Night of Kersten.
Kersten was a staunch critic of the policies of Colijn. The speaker of the Dutch parliament had parts of Kersten's contributions to debates edited in the Proceedings no less than thirteen times between 1922 and 1940. Kersten feared the rise of fascism and Nazism in the inter-war period, but assessed fascism's authoritarian tendencies favourably, seeing socialism and Catholic Christianity as greater evils.
During World War II, Kersten denounced resistance against the Nazis, claiming the occupation of the Netherlands was a deserved divine punishment for desecration of the Lord's Day (Sunday). He also refused to sign a 1941 protest of the Convent of Dutch Churches (Dutch: "Convent der Kerken") against the persecution of Jews during the war. After the war, a government committee barred him from returning to Parliament. He focused on writing theological works. Kersten died three years later, in 1948.

PWS-24

The PWS-24 was a Polish single-engine passenger aircraft for 4 passengers, built in PWS factory, used from 1933 to 1936 by LOT Polish Airlines. In spite of its limited capacity, it was the only series-built airliner of domestic design ever used by the LOT.
Development.
The aircraft was a development of an unsuccessful PWS-21, utilizing its lightweight construction wing (weight 300 kg). A fuselage and stabilizers were new. The main designer was Stanisław Cywiński. The prototype (markings SP-AGR) first flew in August 1931 in Biała Podlaska. After trials and some modifications, it won a Ministry of Communication's contest for a successor of Junkers F-13 in LOT airlines, against Lublin R-XVI. In June 1932 it took the first place in a passenger aircraft race at the international air meeting in Warsaw.
Polish Ministry of Communication ordered a series of 5 aircraft for LOT airlines, built in 1933 (markings: SP-AJF, -AJG, -AJH, -AJJ, -AJK). In 1932, the prototype SP-AGR was fitted with a more powerful engine, the 300 hp Lorraine Algol, instead of the 240 hp Wright Whirlwind J-5. It was later tested with a 400 hp Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp Junior engine. Maximum speed improved from 185 to 225 km/h, comparing with the basic variant.
In 1934 a production of further 5 aircraft started, with Wasp Junior engines, designated PWS-24bis (markings: SP-AMN, -AMO, -AMP, -AMR, -AMS). Also one PWS-24 was converted to PWS-24bis (SP-ASY, ex. SP-AJH).
Usage.
PWS-24 were put into use in LOT Polish Airlines from May 1, 1933 on domestic lines. Their flight characteristics and durability proved however worse, than of single-engined Fokker F.VIIa/1m, used by LOT, so their service was not long. In 1935 three PWS-24 (SP-AGR, -AJF, -AJJ) were converted to aerial photography variant, but in 1936 four PWS-24s were broken up. The last, SP-AJJ, was broken up in 1938.
PWS-24bis entered service in LOT in 1935. They were used there however only until 1936. PWS-24bis SP-AMR was sold in April 1935 to the Polish Air Force and used as a staff machine. It had a slight accident and compulsory landing on 27 April 1935, its further fate is not known. SP-ASY and -AMN were broken up in 1936-1937. SP-AMO was sold in 1936 to Maritime and Colonial League paramilitary organization and soon crashed in July 1936 during testing of a new variable-pitch propeller.
The remaining two PWS-24bis (SP-AMP and-AMS) were converted to aerial photography in 1936 and used until the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. After the German invasion, SP-AMP was damaged during bombing, while SP-AMS was evacuated to Romania, where it was seized by Romanian government in February 1940 and later used by the LARES line to aerial photography. It was broken up after an accident 8 September 1940.
Description.
High-wing cantilever monoplane of mixed construction, with closed cab and single engine. A fuselage of a steel frame, covered with canvas on a wooden frame. Straight one-piece wooden wing, with elliptical endings, two-spar, plywood covered. Tailfins of steel frame, canvas covered. Crew of two (pilot and mechanic), in a cab before the wing, with twin controls. Next and below in a fuselage, under the wing, there was a cabin for 4 passengers, with wide rectangular windows and a door on the left side. Radial engine in fuselage front, fitted with a Townend ring. Two-blade metal propeller of variable pitch. Conventional fixed landing gear, with a rear skid; struts with shock absorbers joined the main gear with wings. Fuel tanks 260 L in central wing section (cruise consumption 50-58 L/h in PWS-24, 95 L/h in PWS-24bis).

Sedrup

Sedrup (formerly Southwarp or Southcote) is a hamlet in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located south west of the town of Aylesbury, close to the villages of Stone, Bishopstone and Hartwell which also provide the name of the civil parish within which Sedrup lies.
Most of the hamlet is within the boundaries of the Sedrup Conservation Area.
Sedrup contains 5 grade II listed structures. 4 of which are cottage and one a house.
World War 2.
During World War II, Prisoner of War Camp No. 36 "Hartwell Dog Track" was located in Sedrup. It was known to house Italian prisoners from 1942 to 1946 and consisted mostly of tents with one hut. A 1946 RAF aerial photo of the site shows camp buildings at Grid reference SP797121 , on what is now the Meadoway housing estate adjacent to Sedrup Lane. Remains of the camp were still evident on the site in the 1950s.
Lordship.
In 2025, Freddy Kalder became the tenth Lord of Southcote, by rightful ownership of the lawful rights to the lordship. These rights are enshrined in the laws of England as incorporeal hereditaments and have been re-established through due legal process by a learned authority within the realm in compliance with the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act of 1925.

List of Texas hurricanes (1980–present)

From 1980 to the present, 82 tropical or subtropical cyclones affected the U.S. state of Texas. According to David Roth of the Weather Prediction Center, a tropical cyclone makes landfall along the coastline about three times every four years. On any segment of the coastline, a hurricane makes landfall about once every six years.
The most active month is September, with 21 total storms, while no recorded storms have affected Texas during the months of December through May. The most intense storm in terms of barometric pressure and maximum sustained winds is Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which also caused the most fatalities and damages, with $125 billion in Texas. The first storm to impact the state during the period is Hurricane Allen in August 1980, with the most recent being Hurricane Beryl in July 2024.
During the 1980s, multiple tropical cyclones affected the state, of which six made landfall as hurricanes; two made landfall in the state as major hurricanes. Hurricane Alicia is the most destructive hurricane of the decade, severely impacting the Greater Houston area. The names of all the major hurricanes that impacted Texas during the 1980s were later retired by the World Meteorological Organization. In contrast to the 1980s, during the 1990s only one hurricane, Hurricane Bret, made landfall on the Texas coast. In the next decade five hurricanes would make landfall on Texas. Hurricane Ike, the second costliest hurricane to impact Texas, made landfall during the decade. Other notable systems include Tropical Storm Allison and Hurricane Rita.
Deadly storms.
The following is a list of tropical storms with known deaths in the state.

Watford and Rickmansworth Railway

The Watford and Rickmansworth Railway (W&amp;RR) ran services between Watford and Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire, England. The company was incorporated in 1860; the line opened in 1862. The Rickmansworth branch was closed to passengers in 1952 and to freight in 1983. The Croxley Green branch closed in its entirety in 1996. The section between Watford Junction and Colne Junction remains in use as part of the London Overground.
Lord Ebury's railway.
The Watford and Rickmansworth Railway was a business venture of the Whig politician, Robert Grosvenor, 1st Baron Ebury (1801–1893), at a time of great competition among railway companies vying to construct new, lucrative passenger routes. In July 1860, Lord Ebury obtained powers in the (23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. cxi) to construct a 4.5 mile single track line between Watford and Rickmansworth which opened in October 1862. It was nicknamed the "Ebury Line" after the railway company's founder and first chairman. The Rickmansworth terminus was located opposite the church to the south of the town where interchange sidings were provided with the nearby Grand Union Canal. The line had two other stations, Watford Junction and Watford High Street. The depot was situated on Wiggenhall Road in Watford.
Lord Ebury's vision was to construct a railway running southbound from Watford to on the Great Western Railway's Uxbridge branch, eventually providing a new route from Watford to via Uxbridge and . The GWR offered to put up £20,000 towards the project and the Uxbridge and Rickmansworth Railway Act 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. lxxiii) was obtained to give authorisation to construct an extension from Rickmansworth to Uxbridge. The GWR later withdrew its offer of funding and the scheme foundered. Lord Ebury's ambition to link Watford and Uxbridge was never realised, and the W&amp;RR was to remain a short branch line for its entire operation.
Despite hopes that the railway would bring further economic development to Rickmansworth and would serve the small factories and warehouses which had developed along the Grand Union Canal, it was Watford which actually grew at a faster pace and drew business from Rickmansworth. The construction of the railway was dogged with financial problems and a further act of Parliament, the (26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. cxxxi), had to be passed to authorise the issue of further shares to the value of £30,000 (£40,000 worth of shares had already been issued). The initial daily service consisted of five trains each way from Rickmansworth to Watford. The line was worked from the outset by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), which shared Watford Junction station with the W&amp;RR. For the first 19 years, the LNWR operated services and paid the W&amp;RR 50% of the gross earnings of the line.
Attempts were made to remedy the W&amp;RR's financial problems by opening several freight branches; a branch was driven along the edge of Croxley Common to serve Dickinson's paper mills and the Grand Union Canal at Croxley Green, and another short branch near Watford High Street served the warehouses of Benskins Brewery. The line ran close to the watercress beds of the River Gade and a steady trade developed in transporting hampers of watercress to Watford Market, resulting in the W&amp;RR trains being nicknamed "Watercress Trains".
The Official Receiver was called in four years after opening. Despite all attempts to make Lord Ebury's railway into a commercial success, the company faced bankruptcy and by the (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. xcvi) it was absorbed by its operations partner, the burgeoning LNWR.
Extension to Croxley Green.
In the early 20th century, suburban railway competition was on the increase and the growing Metropolitan Railway was steadily expanding in north-west London. Although the Metropolitan did not reach the town of Watford until 1925, the LNWR was keen to act against emerging competition and in 1908 began work on a new branch line to . The extension involved the construction of a substantial bridge over the Grand Junction Canal. Passenger services on the new route commenced on 15 June 1912, with freight services starting on 1 October.
The following year, the LNWR built a new stretch of track from Watford High Street over the River Colne to Bushey &amp; Oxhey railway station, with another connecting line turning south towards Rickmansworth. This new, triangular junction not only created a connection between the former W&amp;RR lines and the LNWR's "New Line", but also enabled passenger services to run directly from Croxley Green to for the first time. The semi-rural location of the Croxley Green terminus gave added credence to the LNWR's slogan "Live in the Country".
In March 1913, Croxley Green station was burned down; it was suspected that the fire had been started deliberately by suffragettes.
Electrification and pre-war years.
Electric services were introduced over the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway on 16 April 1917 worked by tube trains of the London Electric Railway (LER) running through from Queen's Park to Watford on weekdays only until a daily service was introduced in July 1919; this was done to cope with the voltage drop caused by the branch being supplied only from the Watford end. These services were supplemented by LNWR trains from Broad Street during peak periods and steam trains from Euston. The Croxley Green branch was electrified on 30 October 1922, with Rickmansworth following in September 1927 as part of the LNWR's New Line Project.
With the vesting of the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway in the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMSR) in 1923, the nine joint LNWR/LER electric tube cars became known as "watercress trains" due to the volume of watercress gathered in the Chess Valley that the trains often carried in their luggage compartments. The stock was finally withdrawn in 1939 with the introduction of emergency war timetables and replaced with main line size electric stock.
Decline and closure.
Rickmansworth branch.
Notwithstanding the introduction of electric services, the Rickmansworth branch suffered in the face of the more direct services to London provided by the Metropolitan. Traffic was also eroded by the increased bus competition and private car ownership. Passenger services ceased in 1952. The Church Street station continued to be used for goods services until 1967 when it was completely closed and the line cut back to serve a papermill near Croxley Green until 20 January 1983, British Rail having retained a contract to carry oil fuel supplies. Today the track has been removed and the platforms and station buildings have been demolished. A considerable length of the trackbed is now used as the Ebury Way Cycle Path.
Croxley Green branch.
Although identified in the Beeching Report for closure, consent was refused and a peak service was run for many years along the Croxley Green branch. In the 1980s, attempts were made to revive the fortunes of the Croxley Green branch: a special football station, , was built in 1982 for the use of football supporters visiting Watford FC, although it was only used when Watford were playing at home. In 1988, a twice-hourly daytime service was introduced to further revitalise the line, but this was abandoned in May 1993 and services were reduced to one 6.00am return working from Watford Junction on weekdays — a parliamentary train, run specially to avoid the costly process of officially closing the line. The facilities at the two principal stations along the route, and Watford West were significantly downgraded in the late 1980s and early 1990s.The covered platform at Croxley Green was removed in 1989 and replaced with a temporary scaffolding platform with no protection from the elements. Watford West's booking office was demolished leaving an open concrete concourse and gate. At both stations the covered staircases were demolished and replaced with open stairways.
In March 1996, services to Croxley Green ceased when the construction of the new dual-carriageway Ascot Road severed the route between and Croxley Green. As the line was mothballed rather than formally closed the stations, along with the track, street-level signage and the remaining station facilities, were abandoned rather than demolished, and, apart from the scaffolding platform at Croxley Green, remained in situ for many years. The branch was not formally closed until 2003.
Metropolitan line extension.
A proposed scheme known as the Croxley Rail Link was announced in 2010 by the Department for Transport which planned to extend the London Underground Metropolitan line to Watford Junction by re-opening a section of the Croxley branch of the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway, with two new Tube stations, and . Some on-site preparation work was undertaken but the scheme was cancelled in 2018 due to funding problems.

Alienizers.
 is an umbrella term that S.P.D. gives to aliens that commit various crimes on Earth and other planets. Unlike most monsters in the "Super Sentai" franchise, many of the Alienizers pilot giant robots called , which are usually provided by Agent Abrella.
Agent Abrella.
 is a bat-themed arms dealer from Planet Rain and an infamous figure in the intergalactic black market who is known for causing wars in seven galaxies, destroying billions of lives in the process. As his homeworld's name suggests, it is perpetually raining, forcing him to wear a special helmet that produces an artificial rainy environment to sustain himself on other worlds. After arriving on Earth, he offers his services, as well as Mechanoids and Kaijuki, to his fellow Alienizers for the right price. Initially staying in the shadows, Abrella gathers information on the Deka Base from clients who have successfully infiltrated it and escaped with their lives while planning to eventually realize his desire for a "world of...currency and crime". After eventually making his presence known to the Dekarangers and losing a Browgoul he intended to raise to them, Abrella starts taking their interference personally and launches a failed smear campaign against them. Following this, Abrella takes advantage of the Dekarangers' fight with the Alienizer Jellyfis to break four Alienizers out of prison and lead them in taking over the Deka Base. From there, he uses Deka Base Robo to go on a rampage, lure the bulk of S.P.D.'s forces to Earth, and uses their planetary forcefield against them. While the Dekarangers eventually retake Deka Base Robo and use the D-Bazooka to delete Abrella, he was succeeded by his pupil, Agent X, as of the crossover film "Mahō Sentai Magiranger vs. Dekaranger".
In the direct-to-video anniversary special "Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger: 10 Years After", Kight Reidlich cloned a giant version of Abrella that he kept on Planet Highgord to help him fight the Dekarangers. However, Clone Abrella is killed by Dekaranger Robo piloted by Deka Break.

Washboard Sam

Robert Clifford Brown (July 15, 1910 – November 6, 1966), known professionally as Washboard Sam, was an American blues musician and singer.
Biography.
Brown's date and place of birth are uncertain; many sources state that he was born in 1910 in Walnut Ridge, Arkansas, but the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc suggest that he was born in 1903 or 1904, in Jackson, Tennessee, on the basis of Social Security information. When applying for his musicians union card, he gave his birthdate as July 15, 1914. He was reputedly the half-brother of Big Bill Broonzy. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in the 1920s, performing as a street musician with Sleepy John Estes and Hammie Nixon. He moved to Chicago in 1932, performing regularly with Broonzy and other musicians, including Memphis Slim and Tampa Red, in many recording sessions for Lester Melrose of Bluebird Records.
In 1935, he began recording in his own right for both Bluebird and Vocalion Records, becoming one of the most popular Chicago blues performers of the late 1930s and 1940s, selling numerous records and playing to packed audiences. He recorded over 160 tracks in those decades. His strong voice and songwriting talent overcame his stylistic limitations.
By the 1950s, his audience had begun to shrink, largely because he had difficulty adapting to the new electric blues. His final recording session, for RCA Victor, was in 1949. He retired from music for several years and became a Chicago police officer. He recorded a session in 1953 with Broonzy and Memphis Slim. Samuel Charters included Brown's "I've Been Treated Wrong" on the compilation album "The Country Blues" for Folkways Records in 1959. Brown made a modest and short-lived comeback as a live performer in the early 1960s.
He died of heart disease in Chicago, in November 1966, and was buried in an unmarked grave at the Washington Memory Gardens Cemetery, in Homewood, Illinois.
Memorial.
A concert organized by the executive producer Steve Salter, of the Killer Blues organization, was held on September 18, 2009, at the Howmet Playhouse Theater, in Whitehall, Michigan, to raise money for a headstone for Washboard Sam's grave. The show was a success, and a headstone was placed in October 2009. The concert was recorded by Vinyl Wall Productions and filmed for television broadcast in the central Michigan area by a television crew from Central Michigan University. It featured musical artists such as Washboard Jo and R.B. and Co. and was headlined by the Big House Blues Band.

Porters Lake, Nova Scotia

Porters Lake (2011 population: 3,202) is a rural community in the Eastern Shore region of the Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, between Trunk 7 and Route 207, 27.8 km from Halifax. The residents mainly commute to jobs in Dartmouth, Burnside Industrial Park or in Downtown Halifax. The community is built around the lake from which it takes its name.
The Lake.
Porters Lake is 19 km long, but never more than a kilometre wide and is in the shape of a crescent. The depth of Porters Lake varies significantly from the north end to the south end; the south end is approximately 5 metres deep on average, but the north end averages around 12 metres deep, with one part of the lake reaching 30 metres in depth. It is one of the most popular lakes for recreational boating in the region. The Lake is connected to the Atlantic Ocean near Lawrencetown Beach, because of this, the lake varies in salinity from almost completely fresh water at the north end to nearly that of ocean water at the south end. The communities which surround Porters Lake include, Porters Lake, Middle Porters Lake, West Porters Lake, East Lawrencetown, Three Fathom Harbour and Seaforth. Crowell Road and West Porters Lake Road, run along the west side of the lake. Porters Lake Provincial Park is located off West Porter's Lake Road along the west side of the Lake. Hwy 107 crosses over the Lake and Hwy 7 runs north of the Lake. Hwy 207 runs south of the lake until just past Three Fathom Harbour, where there is limited access to the Lake by road on the east side as the highway and residential communities run along the Atlantic Ocean coast.
2008 fire.
On June 13, 2008, a forest fire broke out destroying two houses, damaging more than 20 others and burning almost 4,800 acres. More than 5,000 residents were evacuated from their homes and several major roads were closed for 3 days. The fire was believed to have been caused by a camp fire, though the Royal Canadian Mounted Police laid no charges. It was determined that residue from Hurricane Juan fueled the fire, which was the largest fire in an urban area of Nova Scotia, and the largest fire overall, in 30 years.
This Street, That Street, and The Other Street.
This Street, That Street, and The Other Street are three streets located in Porters Lake. The trio of streets became an Internet meme during the late 2010s due to their unusual names, being posted on multiple social media sites, including Reddit, Tumblr, and Twitter. They were first discussed in a 2013 Huffington Post article, then shared in a list of the 41 weirdest street names in the United States posted on Mental Floss. "Narcity" also included them in a 2019 list of the 9 most unusual street names in Canada.

Silver mining

Silver mining is the extraction of silver by mining. Silver is a precious metal and holds high economic value. Because silver is often found in intimate combination with other metals, its extraction requires the use of complex technologies. In 2008, approximately 25,900 metric tons of silver were consumed worldwide, most of which came from mining. Silver mining has a variety of effects on the environment, humans, and animals.
Silver sources.
Silver-bearing ore typically contains very little silver, with much higher percentages of copper and lead. Specific minerals include argentite (Ag2S), chlorargyrite ("horn silver," AgCl), polybasite (Ag, Cu)16Sb2S11), and proustite (Ag3AsS3). Silver mainly occurs as a contaminant in chalcopyrite and galena, important ores of copper and lead, respectively.
Some ores are actually mined explicitly for their silver value vs. the silver being a byproduct of other metals. However, silver is only found rarely in a native form as nuggets, in placer deposits, and veins.
Excavation.
Methods for mining silver change for every body of ore. The method that's chosen depends on the grade of the ore, the steepness and shape of the terrain, its depth, host rock, transportation availability, and other economic factors. Commonly, silver ore is obtained from open pit mines, and underground drifts and shafts. Explosives are frequently used to shatter veins into manageable pieces, which are transported via mine cars and then lifted to the surface. This process can be dangerous. 
Ore processing.
Once removed from the mine, silver-containing ore is crushed (comminution) into a fine powder to expose individual grains to chemical processing. As a byproduct of the mining of lead and copper, silver ores are often purified by froth flotation. After froth flotation, silver is extracted by a cyanide process, akin to technology used for gold extraction. In some cases, the ore is treated by smelting before cyanide treatment. Silver is also produced during the electrolytic refining of copper and by application of the Parkes process on lead ores. Commercial grade fine silver is at least 99.9 percent pure silver, and purities greater than 99.999 percent are available.
Recycling.
About 5000 tons of silver are annually recovered from scrap. Jewelry, photographic film, silverware, coins, and electronics are sources of recyclable silver. However, jewelry and silverware are not as important of a source of recycled metal compared to electronics and photographic film. The main techniques to process silver scrap: electrolysis, metallic replacement, and precipitation. Electrolytic silver recovery refers to the process where silver cations are reduced to their metallic state, adhering to an electrode.
In metallic replacement, a solution of silver thiosulfate is converted to the metallic state by the action of a solid reducing agent, such a steel wool. The equipment in this process is commonly referred to as "metallic recovery cartridges".
Precipitation refers to the process of extracting silver from silver-rich solutions. This technique uses precipitating agents to form silver sulfide in the solution. The precipitation method is not extensively utilized due to the fact that excess sulfide can result in the release of toxic gas.
Production areas.
The principal sources of silver are copper, copper-nickel, gold, lead, and lead-zinc ores obtained from Canada, Mexico, Poland, Peru, Bolivia, Australia and the United States.
Mexico was the world's largest silver producer in 2014, producing 5,000 metric tons (161 million troy ounces), 18.7 percent of the 26,800 tonnes (862 million troy ounce) production of the world.
Silver mining companies.
Silver mining companies engage in the discovery and production of silver. While these companies prioritize in silver, many of them also engage in other metals such as gold, palladium, lead, and zinc. 
History.
The historical record of silver mining dates back to 3,000 BC in Anatolia. As silver is a precious metal often used for coins and bullion, its mining has historically often been lucrative. As with other precious metals such as gold or platinum, newly discovered deposits of silver ore have sparked silver rushes of miners seeking their fortunes. Silver was a valuable metal that helped early civilizations around Ancient Greece. In recent centuries, large deposits were discovered and mined in the Americas, influencing the growth and development of Mexico, Andean countries such as Bolivia, Chile and Peru, as well as Argentina, Canada and the United States.
Silver is mentioned in the Book of Genesis, and slag heaps found in Asia Minor and on the islands of the Aegean Sea indicate that silver was being separated from lead as early as the 4th millennium BC. By 1,200 BC, silver mining shifted into the mines of Laurion in Greece, and continued growing the surrounding empire. The silver mines at Laurion were very rich and helped provide a currency for the economy of ancient Athens, where the process involved mining the ore in underground galleries, washing and then smelting it to produce the metal. Elaborate washing tables still exist at the site which used rain water held in cisterns and collected during the winter months.
By the year 100 AD, the epicenter of silver mining transitioned into Spain, where the Roman Empire flourished. The Romans took over silver mining in Spain from Carthage after their acquisition of Carthaginian territories there following the Second Punic War. Extraction of silver from lead ore was widespread in Roman Britain very soon after the Roman conquest of the first century AD.
One of the main aims of the Viking expansion throughout Europe was to acquire and trade silver. Bergen and Dublin are still important centres of silver making. An example of a collection of Viking-age silver for trading purposes is the Galloway Hoard.
From the mid-15th century silver began to be extracted from copper ores in massive quantities using the liquation process creating a boost to the mining and metallurgy industries of Central Europe.
Americas.
Vast amounts of silver were brought into the possession of the crowns of Europe after the conquest of the Americas from the now Mexican state of Zacatecas (discovered in 1546) and Potosí (also discovered in 1546), which triggered the Spanish Price Revolution in Europe. Between 1500 and 1800, Bolivia, Peru, and Mexico made of 85% of the world's total silver production. Silver mining required large amounts of mercury to extract the metal from ore. In the Andes, the source was the Huancavelica mercury mine; Mexico was dependent on mercury from the Almadén mercury mine in Spain. Mercury had a high adverse environmental impact. Silver was extremely valuable in China, and became a global commodity. Manila galleons carried Spanish dollars across the Pacific, contributing to the rise of the Spanish Empire. The rise and fall of its value affected the world market.In the first half of the 19th century Chilean mining revived due to a silver rush in the Norte Chico region, leading to an increased presence of Chileans in the Atacama desert and a shift away from an agriculture based economy.
The country of Argentina was named after its silver resources by Spanish conquistadors; Argentina is a Spanish adjective meaning "silvery".
Silver mining was a driving force in the settlement of western North America, with major booms for silver and associated minerals (lead, mostly) in the galena ore silver is most commonly found in. Notable silver rushes were in Colorado; Nevada; Cobalt, Ontario; California and the Kootenay region of British Columbia; notably in the Boundary and "Silvery" Slocan. A silver rush in Idaho produced mines in an area known as Silver Valley, a handful of which are still active today. The first major silver ore deposits in the United States were discovered at the Comstock Lode in Virginia City, Nevada, in 1859. By the 1870's, silver production had increased from 40 millions ounces per year to 80 million.
From 1872 to 1920, a surge of technological innovation increased global silver production to 120 million ounces produced per year. New silver deposits had been discovered in Australia, Canada, United States, Africa, Mexico, Chile, and Japan, and by the end of 1920, global production surged to 190 million ounces annually. The mining techniques during the 1900's had also dramatically changed. Seam-assisted drilling, mine dewatering, and improved haulage all contributed to the spike in silver production in the 1900's. By 2019, technological innovation has allowed silver production to grow to almost 800 million ounces per year.
Environmental effects of silver mining.
Mercury amalgamation.
Mercury amalgamation is a technique used to extract gold and silver from lower-grade ores. Mercury quickly sticks to gold and silver and forms pasty amalgams, making extraction easier. After separating it from the ore, amalgam is roasted and mercury vapor escapes into the atmosphere and also makes its way into rivers and soils. From the years 1545 to 1803, over 25,000 tons of silver were produced using amalgamation in the Potosi mines. At its peak, the town had over 6,000 smelting furnaces spreading toxic Mercury. Mercury-rich tailings are also often left in mines.
The amalgamation methods have proven problematic. It is estimated that 90% of the mercury consumed in the United States from 1850 to 1900 was used to extract silver and gold. An estimated 257,400 tonnes of mercury were lost to the environment in this process in the Americas since the patio process was first used. 60–65% of this is likely released into the atmosphere, being the single largest contributor to the global mercury cycle.
In the year 2000, small-scale miners in Chile experienced many risks to their health, safety, and hygiene from toxic pollution. This was due to wastewater being released into underground waters and creating significant quantities of mercury.
Contaminants are also known to enter drinking water in and around abandoned silver mines. Well water in South Morelos State, Mexico, was found to have high concentrations of toxic minerals including arsenic, iron, manganese, lead, and fluorine. This is attributed to the abandoned and flooded silver mine at Huautla. Groundwaters flooded the mine-shafts after they were abandoned in the early 1990s, which allowed for oxidation and mobilization of these dangerous contaminants.
Effects of silver mining on Indigenous communities.
Mining has negative impacts on both humans and societies. It affects Indigenous peoples living in communities nearby silver mines in many ways. Mine work puts a significant amount of mental stress on indigenous workers due to long hours, rough working conditions, repetitive nature of the work, roster schedules, and potential job loss.
The use of addictive substances is also an active concern amongst indigenous workers. Well-paid workers are more likely to buy alcohol and binge drink. This leads to various health effects such as cirrhosis of the liver, brain damage, and fetal alcohol syndrome.
Silver mining operations in indigenous communities lead to increased hunting pressure and a decline in traditional practices due to population growth and better hunting technologies. This affects local animal populations and cultural rituals. People spend time at the mine rather than in traditional activities like hunting and fishing, which threaten the spreading of ecological knowledge and cultural practices. While mining can provide economic resources for purchasing hunting equipment, it also accelerates the decline in traditional lifestyles and cultural heritage, impacting food security and community cohesion in indigenous populations.
Mining projects also pose significant threats to family integrity, manifesting in decreased quality and quantity of family life due to long working hours and associated stressors, as well as disruptions to traditional familial roles and responsibilities. Limited time for communication and support may exacerbate existing problems within families. This leads to fragmentation and potential conflicts, with spouses having increased household responsibilities and children facing adverse consequences such as behavioral issues and academic struggles.
Silver mining in indigenous communities lead to social change with Western values often replacing traditional ones. While some argue that mining can promote cultural values such as independence and pride through job creation and increased disposable income, others highlight negative impacts such as the loss of traditional languages, attributed to factors like migration, labor market participation, and lack of educational support.

Torrontés

Torrontés is a white grape variety, mostly produced and known in Argentina, producing fresh, aromatic wines with moderate acidity, smooth texture and mouthfeel as well as distinctive peach and apricot aromas on the nose. Three Torrontés varieties exist in Argentina: Torrontés Riojano, the most common, Torrontés Sanjuanino, and Torrontés Mendocino. It is primarily Torrontés Riojano that has received attention for the quality of its wines, and is the variety used for most Argentine wines simply labeled Torrontés.
The three grapes are relatively similar but do have some noticeable differences. Torrontés Riojano and Torrontés Sanjuanino both tend to have large loose bunches of pale grapes while Torrontés Mendocino, however, has smaller, tighter bunches of darker yellow grapes. Torrontés Riojano is the most aromatic of the three, with aromas reminiscent of Muscat and Gewürtztraminer wines. The least aromatic, and least widely planted, is Torrontés Mendocino with the aromatics and plantings of Torrontés Sanjuanino falling in between. All three Argentine Torrontés varieties belong to the "Criollas" group of grape varieties, which is a term used for presumably American-born cultivars of the European grapevine "Vitis vinifera".
Around in Argentina have been planted with Torrontés Riojano, and with Torrontés Sanjuanino. Plantings in the very high altitudes (1700m+) of the Calchaquíes Valleys in the far north of Argentina have recently met with success. The vine is highly productive and is just under ten percent of all white grape plantings, however as a varietal, it made up almost 20 percent of all white wine sold in Argentina in 2008. The Salta region in northwest Argentina is particularly noted for its Torrontés as the grape thrives in cold dry, windswept conditions.
History and relation to other grapes.
Recent research using DNA profiling has shown that the different Torrontés are genetically closely related but distinct grape varieties, and that Torrontés Riojano, Torrontés Sanjuanino, and Torontel (also known as Moscatel Amarillo) are all separate crossings of Mission (originally reported as Criolla Chica) and Muscat of Alexandria. Torrontés Mendocino was found to probably be a crossing of Muscat of Alexandria and another, so far unidentified grape variety. While the Muscat-like qualities of the Torrontés varieties meant that a relationship to Muscat of Alexandria had been expected, the presence of Mission or Criolla Chica in the pedigree was unexpected to the researchers.
For many years it was believed that the Torrontés of South America was the same variety as the Torrontés grape from Galicia in Spain, also known as Albillo Mayor. This widespread belief was due, in part, to the frequent migration waves of Galician workers that have immigrated to Argentina throughout its history. Indeed, even wine expert Jancis Robinson, noted as much in her 1986 book on the world's grape varieties. However, recent DNA evidence shows that there is probably no direct relationship between the Argentine and Spanish Torrontés varieties and more recent editions of Robinson's wine books acknowledge the new findings.
There is also a less common red wine grape called Torrontés, which is also known under the synonyms Tarrantes and Turrundos.
Wine regions.
Torrontés is grown throughout Argentina and its acreage is steadily increasing. Part of its increase in numbers comes from the increase in Argentine wine exportation where the grape has found considerable success in the United States, United Kingdom and abroad but also from a better understanding and identification of the different Torrontés varieties that allow for better accounting of plantings. For most of its history (including into the late 20th century) Torrontés lagged behind Pedro Giménez and Ugni blanc among white grape varieties in Argentina. But by the early 21st century, declining plantings in those two varieties and the growing popularity of Torrontés allowed it to surpass them and become Argentina's most widely planted white variety where it continued to be as of 2008.
The different Torrontés varieties have developed niche in different areas of Argentina. Torrontés Riojano is widely grown in the La Rioja and Salta provinces of northern Argentina and is, in fact, the single most widely planted variety (both red and white) in La Rioja. In Salta, the grape is often planted in high altitude, sandy vineyards that are often more than above sea level. Here, the harsh growing conditions allow the variety to attain high acidity and assertive flavors.
In the arid San Juan province, Torrontés Sanjuanino is found but is planted to a much less significant amount than Torrontés Riojano. Torrontés Mendocino is, by far, the least widely planted variety and is mostly found in the southern province of Rio Negro.
Outside of Argentina.
Torrontés is grown in Chile. However, the exact number of plantings (and of which variety) are not completely known. In 1996, Jancis Robinson noted that there were several hundred hectares of "Torontel" grown but that some of these plantings may actually be the Galician variety. Additionally, Torrontés is known in Chile often under the synonym "Moscatel de Austria", which is believed to be Torrontés Sanjuanino. 
According to wine expert Oz Clarke, most plantings of Torrontés in Chile are Torrontés Riojano and the grape is primarily used in the production of the Chilean brandy, "pisco".
Torrontes is also grown in Samaipata, Bolivia.
Spanish Torrontés.
While DNA evidence shows that there is probably no relationship between the Galician variety of Torrontés and the South American variety, consumers may still see Spanish wine labeled as Torrontés from the Galician wine region of Ribeiro as well as other "Denominación de Origen" such as the Gran Canaria of the Canary Islands (most likely the Terrantez variety of Madeira), Montilla-Moriles and Madrid.
Wine style.
According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, Torrontés has the capability of producing wines of high quality, but its success is dependent on the skill and care of the winemaking process, particularly in maintaining suitable acid levels to balance the wine. At its most ideal, Robinson notes, Torrontés are "wines for early drinking that are not too heavy, are high in acidity, and are intriguingly aromatic in a way reminiscent of but not identical to Muscat." But poorer made examples can come across as bitter and excessively alcoholic.
Wine expert Oz Clarke, also notes the dependency on careful vinification for the quality of Torrontés but also notes that the size of the harvest yield can also play a substantial role. While the aroma of Torrontés is often associated with Muscat, Clarke notes that many examples can be very similar to Gewürztraminer with subtle spice notes mixed with the floral bouquet of the wine. Clarke also notes that the wine tends not to age very well and is often consumed within a year of its vintage date.
Synonyms.
The three Argentine Torrontés varieties are known under the following names:
In Chile, the variety is also known as Torontel and Moscatel de Austria.

Go-Bang

Go-Bang is an English musical comedy with words by Adrian Ross and music by F. Osmond Carr.
The piece was produced by Fred Harris and opened at the Trafalgar Square Theatre on 10 March 1894. It ran for 159 performances. The show starred Harry Grattan, George Grossmith, Jr., Arthur Playfair, Jessie Bond, and dancer Letty Lind. The American child prodigy "Baby Costello" danced in the interval between acts. Whereas Ross generally acted as lyricist only, in this case he created the book as well as the lyrics.
Synopsis.
Dam Row, the Boojam-elect of the Asian country of Go-Bang, visits England to learn Western manners, escorted by Sir Reddan Tapeleigh. There, he finds that he is not Boojam after all. He falls in love with a dancer after seeing her performance, although he generally finds it difficult to grasp Western ways. He returns to Go-Bang as prime minister to the new chief, a humble greengrocer (previously Sir Reddan's footman), who is to be formally installed as Boojam at the palace in Go Bang. The parents of various girls scheme to marry their daughters to the Boojam. He must stand under the Golden Umbrella, where all decrees are announced, but finds himself married by mistake to three girls in as many minutes. Fortunately, the marriage decree is revoked. Sir Reddan's secretary loves Helen, Sir Reddan's daughter, and she helps him to find documents to prove that he is the rightful Boojam.
Reception.
A review of the piece spoofed the loose plot (though praising it) in the following verse:
"The Times" found the plot laboured and the satire heavy-handed, but praised the songs, Letty Lind's dancing, Grattan's and Grossmith's portrayals and Bond's singing. The most popular song was Lind's song "Di, Di, Di", and Lind earned the highest praise from "The Observer".

Malawi national cricket team

The Malawian national cricket team is the men's team that represents Malawi in international cricket.
History.
Malawi was previously a member of the East and Central Africa Cricket Conference, which was a member of the ICC from 1989 to 2003 and fielded the East and Central Africa cricket team in the ICC Trophy.
From the 1970s, Malawi played regular international tournaments against other East and Central African teams, and occasionally against touring teams from England.
In 2002 Malawi participated in the Africa Cup in which 10 nations took part. Malawi came last in the group, losing all 4 matches.
They became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2003 and an associate member in 2017. Their international debut came the following year in the African affiliates championship, where they came fourth. They participated in the equivalent tournament in 2006, Division Three of the African region of the World Cricket League, once again coming fourth.
In October 2009 Malawi hosted the WCL Africa Div 3 tournament, beating all participants to win the tournament. They were promoted to WCL Africa Division 2 for the next tournament in Benoni, SA. They struggled at this level and finished last.
2018–present.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Malawi and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.
Malawi played their first T20I on 6 November 2019, against Mozambique, during the 2019 T20 Kwacha Cup.

Mark Pocan

Mark William Pocan ( ; born August 14, 1964) is an American politician and businessman serving as the U.S. representative from Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district since 2013. The district is based in the state capital, Madison. A member of the Democratic Party, Pocan is co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and chair emeritus of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. From 1999 to 2013 he served as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 78th district, succeeding Tammy Baldwin there, whom he also replaced in the House when Baldwin was elected to the U.S. Senate.
Early life and education.
Pocan was born and raised in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He graduated from Harvey Elementary School, Washington Junior High School, and Mary D. Bradford High School in 1982, where he was elected senior class president. He attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison, earning a bachelor's degree in journalism in 1986.
Early career.
Shortly after graduating, Pocan opened up his own small business, a printing company named Budget Signs &amp; Specialties, which he continues to own and run as of 2012. He is a member of the AFL-CIO, which he joined as a small business owner.
Pocan's active years at UW–Madison in College Democrats led to his election in 1991 to the Dane County Board of Supervisors, where he served Madison’s downtown community for three terms, leaving the board in 1996.
Wisconsin Assembly.
Elections.
In 1998 Pocan's longtime friend and ally, Tammy Baldwin, gave up her seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly to make a successful run for Congress. Pocan ran to succeed her in the western Madison district and won a three-way Democratic primary with 54% of the vote. He faced no Republican opponent in the general election and won with 93% of the vote against an independent. He won reelection in 2000 with 81%—the only time he faced a Republican challenger. He was unopposed for reelection from 2002 to 2010.
Tenure.
As a state legislator, Pocan earned a reputation for moving the Wisconsin political debate to the left. One of the most outspoken progressive members of the state assembly, he focused on issues including corrections reform, the state budget, education funding, and fighting privatization schemes.
For six years, Pocan sat on the Joint Finance Committee, including a term as co-chair. He also took on a leading role among Assembly Democrats, running caucus campaign efforts in 2008 when Democrats went from five seats down to retaking the majority for the first time in 14 years.
Pocan is one of the few progressive Democrats to have joined the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative-leaning organization that produces model legislative proposals. He used his membership to investigate the organization's agenda and sponsors and wrote a series of articles on his experiences with ALEC for the Madison-based magazine "The Progressive" from 2008 to 2011. On the September 29, 2012, edition of "Moyers and Company", Pocan said, "ALEC is a corporate dating service for lonely legislators and corporate special interests that eventually the relationship culminates with some special-interest legislation and hopefully that lives happily ever after as the ALEC model. Unfortunately what's excluded from that equation is the public."
U.S. House of Representatives.
Elections.
In 2012, Baldwin gave up her congressional seat in order to run for the U.S. Senate and Pocan decided to run in the open 2nd congressional district. He won a four-candidate Democratic primary with 72% of the vote. He won all 7 counties in the district, including the heavily populated Dane County with 74% of the vote. The 2nd district is extremely Democratic, and it was widely believed that Pocan would win the general election as its nominee. On November 6, 2012, Pocan won the general election, defeating Republican Chad Lee 68%–32%.
Tenure.
In January 2020, Pocan endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for president. On July 19, 2024, he called for Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 United States presidential election.
In July 2024, in protest of the Gaza–Israel conflict, Pocan chose not to attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress. On March 4, 2025, he walked out of President Trump's address to Congress while Trump was speaking.
On June 25, 2025, Pocan posted a comment on X telling White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who is Jewish, to "go back to 1930's Germany". The White House condemned the post as antisemitic, but Pocan did not apologize, claiming he would refuse to engage with what he called the "racist base of the GOP" and saying that "normal people" understood he was comparing Miller's views to those of the Nazis.
Political positions.
Pocan identifies as a progressive Democrat. He is a member of organizations including Wisconsin Citizens Action, the American Civil Liberties Union, Fair Wisconsin and Midwest Progressive Elected Officials Network.
Budget.
Pocan supports decreasing U.S. military spending. Pocan, Pramila Jayapal and Barbara Lee attempted to reduce the size of the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, but their motion was rejected, 93–324. Jayapal and Pocan, the Congressional Progressive Caucus's co-chairs, said: "Every handout to Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman is money that could have been spent on ending the [COVID-19] pandemic, keeping small businesses afloat and staving off an economic meltdown."
Pocan was among the 46 House Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.
Economy.
Pocan has called himself an opponent of "corporate power" and corporations "that get too big". In March 2021, he criticized Amazon for its treatment of workers, including behavior he described as union busting and "mak[ing] workers urinate in water bottles". The company denied that delivery drivers were sometimes forced to urinate in bottles, but later recanted the statement and apologized to Pocan.
In 2022, Pocan authored legislation to impose a moratorium on mergers and acquisitions in the food and agricultural sector. He supports reforms to federal agricultural commodity checkoff programs, including requiring that the programs publish budgets, be audited, and not contract with lobbyists or engage in anti-competitive practices. Pocan is an original cosponsor of the Farm System Reform Act, which would ban the construction of new concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and attempt to transition away from intensive animal farming, sometimes called "factory farming".
Foreign policy.
Israel–Palestine.
In July 2019, Pocan voted against a House resolution introduced by Representative Brad Schneider opposing the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel. The resolution passed, 398–17.
In May 2021, Pocan and Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drafted a resolution to block the sale of precision-guided weapons to Israel after the Biden administration approved the sale.
After the April 2024 drone strikes on aid workers from World Central Kitchen, Pocan, Jim McGovern, Jan Schakowsky, Nancy Pelosi and 36 other Democratic members of Congress wrote President Biden an open letter urging him to reconsider planned arms shipments to the Israeli military.
Syria.
In 2023, Pocan was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.
Yemen.
In September 2018, Pocan supported legislation invoking the War Powers Resolution of 1973 to stop U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, saying, "The world's worst humanitarian crisis has been triggered by our secretive, illegal war in Yemen waged alongside the Saudi regime. As the Saudis use famine as a weapon of war, starving millions of innocent Yemenis to near death, the United States fuels, coordinates and provides bombs for Saudi airstrikes, and secretly deploys the military to participate in on-the-ground operations with Saudi troops."
In April 2019, after the House passed the resolution withdrawing American support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, Pocan was one of nine lawmakers to sign a letter to President Trump requesting a meeting with him and urging him to sign "Senate Joint Resolution 7, which invokes the War Powers Act of 1973 to end unauthorized US military participation in the Saudi-led coalition's armed conflict against Yemen's Houthi forces, initiated in 2015 by the Obama administration." They wrote that the "Saudi-led coalition's imposition of an air-land-and-sea blockade as part of its war against Yemen's Houthis has continued to prevent the unimpeded distribution of these vital commodities, contributing to the suffering and death of vast numbers of civilians throughout the country" and that Trump's signing the resolution would give a "powerful signal to the Saudi-led coalition to bring the four-year-old war to a close."
Immigration.
In June 2018, Pocan announced that he would introduce legislation to dismantle ICE and establish a commission to determine how the government "can implement a humane immigration enforcement system" after visiting the Mexico–United States border and witnessing "the nation's immigration crisis". Representatives Pramila Jayapal and Adriano Espaillat joined Pocan in introducing the bill, the Establishing a Humane Immigration Enforcement System Act, in July 2018.
Trump administration.
On December 18, 2019, Pocan voted for both articles of impeachment against President Trump.
On February 5, 2025, Pocan introduced the Eliminating Looting of Our Nation by Mitigating Unethical State Kleptocracy (ELON MUSK) Act, which seeks to ban special government employees—especially Elon Musk—from obtaining federal contracts.
Personal life.
Pocan is openly gay. He credits his political activism in part to an incident soon after he graduated from college and opened his printing business, when two men followed him after he left a gay bar and beat him with a baseball bat while they called him "faggot" and other anti-gay slurs. This gay bashing incident spurred him to become active in the Madison LGBT community. Pocan was the only openly gay member of the state Assembly after Tammy Baldwin's election to Congress, and one of three LGBT members of the 100th Wisconsin Legislature, alongside Sen. Tim Carpenter (D–Milwaukee) and bisexual Rep. JoCasta Zamarripa (D–Milwaukee).
On November 24, 2006, Pocan and his long-term partner, Philip Frank, were legally married in Toronto, Ontario.
Pocan's brother, William S. Pocan, serves as a circuit court judge in Milwaukee County.
Pocan is among the few U.S. representatives not to identify with any religion.
Awards and honors.
Pocan has received the following recognitions while in office:

Singspiel (horse)

Singspiel (25 February 1992 – 1 July 2010) was an Irish-bred Thoroughbred racehorse and sire best known for a series of wins in major international races in 1996 and 1997. In a racing career which lasted from September 1994 until August 1997 he won nine of his twenty races and finished second on eight occasions. After showing good, but unexceptional form in his first two seasons he emerged as a world class performer in 1996 when he won the Canadian International Stakes and Japan Cup and was named U.S. Champion Male Turf Horse. In the following season he added victories in the Dubai World Cup, Coronation Cup and International Stakes before his career was ended by injury. After his retirement from racing he had considerable success as a sire of winners before his death in 2010.
Background.
Singspiel was a small, dark-coated bay horse with a small white star bred in Ireland by his owner Sheikh Mohammed. He was sired by In the Wings, a son of Sadler's Wells whose wins included the Coronation Cup, the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and the Breeders' Cup Turf in America. At stud he also sired Winged Love (Irish Derby), Adlerflug (German Derby), Act One (Prix Lupin), Kutub (Singapore Gold Cup) and Mamool (Grosser Preis von Baden). Singspiel's dam was the Eclipse Award winner and Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame Glorious Song who also produced the successful racehorse and breeding stallion Rahy.
The colt was sent into training with Michael Stoute at the Freemason Lodge stables at Newmarket, Suffolk.
Racing career.
1994: two-year-old season.
Singspiel began his racing career at Leicester Racecourse on 6 September 1994, when he finished fifth in a maiden race over seven furlongs. Two weeks later he recorded his first victory when he was made the 4/6 favourite for the Marford Maiden Stakes at Chester Racecourse and won from seven opponents. On 8 October he ran in the Hyperion Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. Singspiel proved no match for the year's outstanding two-year-old Celtic Swing, who beat him by eight lengths, but he finished ten lengths clear of the other runners.
1995: three-year-old season.
As a three-year-old in 1995 Singspiel ran consistently but won only once from six races. He began his season by running second by a neck to Pentire in the Sandown Classic Trial and then finished fourth to Luso when favourite for the Chester Vase. He then finished second to Valanour in the Grand Prix de Paris and to Halling in the Eclipse Stakes, beaten a neck on each occasion. He was beaten a short head by Pentire in the Great Voltigeur Stakes before winning the Troy Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September.
1996: four-year-old season.
Singspiel began his third season on 27 April at Sandown Park Racecourse, when he defeated his stable companion Pilsudski by three lengths in the Gordon Richards Stakes. He was then beaten a neck by Swain in the Coronation Cup at Epsom Downs Racecourse in June and finished second to Posidonas in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in July.
In September Singspiel won the Select Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse from three opponents and then began to race outside Europe. On 29 September he was made favourite for the Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racecourse and won by two lengths from the local champion Chief Bearhart under a "hands and heels" ride from Gary Stevens. A month later he returned to Woodbine for the thirteenth running of the Breeders' Cup Turf. He finished second to Pilsudski, ahead of a strong field including Swain, Shantou, Awad, Dushyantor and Chief Bearhart. In November, Singspiel was sent to Tokyo Racecourse to contest the Japan Cup. Ridden by Frankie Dettori he won a closely contested finish by a nose from the Japanese filly Fabulous La Fouine with the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Helissio in third.
In January 1997, Singspiel won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Male Turf Horse ahead of Fastness and Diplomatic Jet.
1997: five-year-old season.
In early 1997, Singspiel was sent to the United Arab Emirates where he was trained for the second running of the Dubai World Cup on 3 April. Racing on dirt for the first time, Sheikh Mohammed's horse was ridden by the American jockey Jerry Bailey who had won the inaugural running of the race on Cigar. After an eventful race, in which two horses fell, Singspiel claimed the £1.5 million prize, beating the Santa Anita Handicap winner Siphon by one and a quarter lengths. The beaten horses included Formal Gold who went on to defeat Skip Away in the Woodward Stakes. Bailey said that "with Singspiel's attitude, I knew I could take on anything", while Stoute described the win as the horse's "crowning moment". On his return to England was an easy winner of the Coronation Cup, beating Dushyantor by five lengths. In July he finished fourth behind Swain, Pilsudski and Helissio in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. Sinspiel's final race was the International Stakes at York on 19 August in which his three rivals were the outstanding filly Bosra Sham, The Derby winner Benny the Dip and the Irish Derby winner Desert King. Ridden by Dettori, Singspiel took the lead in the straight and stayed on "gamely" to win by one and a half lengths from Desert King.
Singspiel was being prepared for a second attempt at the Breeders' Cup Turf at Hollywood Park when he sustained a condylar fracture of his right front leg and was retired from racing.
Stud career.
Singspiel was retired after the 1997 season and was sent to Sheikh Mohammed's Dalham Hall Stud near Newmarket in England to stand at stud. He was "shuttled" to stand in Australia in 2001 but the experiment was not repeated after the stallion responded poorly to air travel.
Major winners.
"c = colt, f = filly, g = gelding"
Singspiel was euthanised on 1 July 2010 at Newmarket Equine Hospital due to laminitis following an illness. Sheikh Mohammed's bloodstock advisor John Ferguson described him as "an outstandingly tough racehorse" who would be "sadly missed".

Madeleine Leininger

Madeleine Leininger (July 13, 1925 – August 10, 2012) was a nursing theorist, nursing professor and developer of the concept of transcultural nursing. First published in 1961, her contributions to nursing theory involve the discussion of what it is to care.
Biography.
Leininger was born on 13 July 1925. She earned a nursing diploma from St. Anthony's Hospital School of Nursing, followed by undergraduate degrees at Benedictine College and Creighton University. She received a Master of Science in Nursing at Catholic University of America. She later studied cultural and social anthropology at the University of Washington, earning a PhD in 1966. Leininger held at least three honorary doctoral degrees.
Dr. Leininger held faculty positions at the University of Cincinnati and the University of Colorado, followed by service as a nursing school dean at both the University of Washington and the University of Utah. She was Professor Emeritus of Nursing at Wayne State University and an adjunct faculty member at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Leininger died at her home in Omaha, Nebraska on 10 August 2012.
Cultural care theory.
The cultural care theory aims to provide culturally congruent nursing care through "cognitively based assistive, supportive, facilitative, or enabling acts or decisions that are mostly tailor-made to fit with individual's, group's, or institution's cultural values, beliefs, and lifeways" (Leininger, M. M. (1995). Transcultural nursing: Concepts, theories, research &amp; practices. New York: McGraw Hill, Inc.5, p. 75) This care is intended to fit with or have beneficial meaning and health outcomes for people of different or similar cultural backgrounds.
Components of culturalogical assessment.
Leininger proposes that there are three modes for guiding nursing care judgements, decisions, or actions to provide appropriate, beneficial, and meaningful care:
(a) preservation and/or maintenance
(b) accommodation and/or negotiation
(c) re-patterning and/or restructuring
"These modes have substantively influenced nurses’ ability to provide culturally congruent nursing care and have fostered the development of competent nurses."
Theoretical assumptions and orientational definitions.
1. Care is the essence of nursing and a distinct, dominant, and unifying focus.
2. Care (caring) is essential for well being, health, healing, growth survival, and to face handicaps or death.
3. Culture care is the broadest holistic means to know, explain, interpret, and predict nursing care phenomena to guide nursing care practices.
4. Nursing is a transcultural, humanistic, and scientific care discipline and profession with the central purpose to serve human beings worldwide.
5. Care (caring) is essential to curing and healing, for there can be no curing without caring.
6. Culture care concepts, meanings, expressions, patterns, processes, and structural forms of care are different (diversity) and similar (towards commonalities or universalities) among all cultures of the world.
7. Every human culture has lay (generic, folk, or indigenous) care knowledge and practices and usually some professional care knowledge and practices which vary transculturally.
8. Cultural care values, beliefs, and practices are influenced by and tend to be embedded in worldview, language, religious (or spiritual), kinship (social), political (or legal), educational, economic, technological, ethnohistorical, and environmental context of a particular culture.
9. Beneficial, healthy, and satisfying culturally based nursing care contributes to the well being of individuals, families, groups, and communities within their environmental context.
10. Culturally congruent or beneficial nursing care can only occur when the individual, group, community, or culture care values, expressions, or patterns are known and used appropriately and in meaningful ways by the nurse with the people.
11. Culture care differences and similarities between professional caregiver(s) and client (generic) care-receiver(s) exist in any human culture worldwide.
12. Clients who experience nursing care that fails to be reasonably congruent with their beliefs, values, and caring lifeways will show signs of cultural conflicts, noncompliance, stresses and ethical or moral concerns.
13. The qualitative paradigm provides new ways of knowing and different ways to discover the epistemic and ontological dimensions of human care transculturally. (Leininger, M. M. (1991). The theory of culture care diversity and universality. New York: National League for Nursing., pp. 44–45)
Leininger focused on two types of knowledge that were present in every culture.
- Emic Knowledge was the folk, lay or generic knowledge that was present in a culture
- Etic Knowledge was the professional or medical knowledge present within the culture and from the outsider perspective
These two types of knowledge intertwined to determine how culture was viewed within the indigenous society and how outside providers would react to it. It was imperative to Leininger that nurses understand specifically the Emic knowledge to have a better understanding of what could be done to tailor nursing care to be more culturally appropriate.
"Leininger defined nursing as a learned scientific and humanistic profession and discipline focused on human care phenomena
and caring activities in order to assist, support, facilitate or enable individuals or groups to maintain or regain their health or well-being in
culturally meaningful and beneficial ways, or to help individuals face handicaps or death." (Leininger, M. M., &amp; McFarland, M. R. (2002). Transcultural nursing:Concepts, theories, research &amp; practice. New York: McGraw Hill., p. 46)
Leininger provides a visual aid to her theory with the Sunrise Model.
Transcultural Nursing.
While Leininger initially started with the creation of the cultural care theory she would later build the theory into a nursing specialty called Transcultural Nursing. In Leininger's own words Transcultural nursing is:
"a substantive area of study and practice focused on comparative cultural care (caring) values, beliefs and practices of individuals or groups of similar or different cultures. Transcultural nursing's goal is to provide culture specific and universal nursing care practices for the health and well-being of people or to help them face unfavorable human conditions, illness or death in culturally meaningful ways."
Combining her nursing experience with the doctorate in Anthropology she had received, Leininger wanted to have nursing look at patients with a cultural perspective, utilizing the indigenous perspective from the patient's own culture and how the outside world would perceive them.

Mercy Harbison

Mary Jane Harbison (March 18, 1770 – December 9, 1837) was a young American woman living in the decades immediately following the Revolutionary War. She was captured by Native Americans in May 1792. Massy escaped after six days and gave a deposition, "Capture and Escape of Mercy Harbison, 1792", which is an example of the American literary genre of captivity narratives.
Early years.
Mary Jane "Massy" White was born on March 18, 1770, in Amwell, New Jersey, the daughter of Edward White, a soldier during the Revolutionary War, and Rebecca Pelton, a descendant of Richard More (Mayflower passenger).
Career.
She married John Harbison in 1787 in Pennsylvania. He was born in Belfast, Ireland, the son of Matthew Harbison Jr. and Margaret "Peg" Carson.
In November 1791, she lived in western Pennsylvania on the Allegheny River above Pittsburgh with three small children. Her husband accompanied General Arthur St. Clair to defeat at the Battle of the Wabash, otherwise known as St. Clair's Defeat and St. Clair's Shame. After the Native American victory, tribes on the frontier increased their attacks on European-American settlements. Harbison's husband was scouting in late May 1792 when the Harbison home was attacked.
Harbison and her three children were captured. The natives killed and scalped her three-year-old child. Her five-year-old son was killed shortly after. She managed to escape after several days, evading re-capture for six days with minimal access to food. Carrying her infant, she navigated barefoot back to Fort Pitt. The deposition of her experiences was given before the magistrates in Pittsburgh.
She and John later separated. John died in 1822 when he was lost at sea; and she died in 1837.

Birch Aquarium

Birch Aquarium is a public aquarium in La Jolla, a community of San Diego, California. It serves as the public outreach center for Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, with over half a million people visiting the aquarium each year.
The aquarium houses more than 9,000 animals representing over 400 species. The hilltop site provides views of La Jolla Shores and the Pacific Ocean. The aquarium is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).
History.
The aquarium was established in 1903 after the Marine Biological Association of San Diego was created to conduct marine research in the local waters of the Pacific Ocean (its name was later changed to Scripps Institution of Oceanography to honor supporters Ellen Browning Scripps and E.W. Scripps, part of the Scripps family of newspaper pioneers). The founders built and maintained the small public aquarium and museum to communicate their discoveries to the world.
The researchers outgrew their modest laboratory in the boathouse of Hotel del Coronado and moved to a small laboratory at La Jolla Cove in 1905. Several years later, the association purchased at La Jolla Shores for $1,000 at a public auction from the city of San Diego. The first permanent building at the new site, the Old Scripps Building, was constructed in 1910. Today it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
In 1915, the first building devoted solely to an aquarium was built on the Scripps campus. The small, wooden structure contained 19 tanks ranging in size from . The oceanographic museum was located in a nearby building.
The Scripps Aquarium-Museum was completed in 1950. Named to honor former institution director T. Wayland Vaughan, it opened in 1951 as the Thomas Wayland Vaughan Aquarium. The three-story facility served the institution for more than 40 years. A ring of 18 tanks, the largest at , surrounded a central museum of glass exhibit cases displaying Scripps research projects. Within a month of its opening, visitors from all 48 states had signed the guest book.
In 1985, the Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation started a fund-raising effort for a new aquarium by donating $6 million. UC San Diego donated the land. JCJ Architecture of San Diego was selected as the design architect, and in 1992, the current $14 million aquarium opened its doors, then known as the Stephen Birch Aquarium-Museum. Shortly afterwards, its name was changed to Birch Aquarium at Scripps. In March 1996, the bronze whale statues "The Legacy" were unveiled in memory of Ted Scripps II. Birch Aquarium celebrated its 20th anniversary in September 2012 by introducing a new visual identity.
There is currently a proposition to expand the aquarium and its facilities throughout 2028.
Exhibits.
At , Birch Aquarium is designed around a central lobby with entrances to exhibit areas. Display tanks contain of seawater. 
Adam R. Scripps Living Seas Gallery.
"Adam R. Scripps Living Seas Gallery" opened to the public on May 22, 2025. "Living Seas," which replaces the aquarium’s much-loved "Hall of Fishes", invites guests to explore the wonders of our ocean planet on an unforgettable, immersive journey to uncover the splendor of the Pacific. It is the largest capital project in the history of the aquarium.  
In "Living Seas", guests can venture into the hidden world of the Giant Pacific Octopus, experience life "under the pier" in a Scripps Pier habitat that offers an up-close view of life on the pilings and peer into an Open Ocean habitat featuring schooling fish and the aquarium’s popular rescued Loggerhead Sea Turtle. A stunning Tropical Coral habitat — more than four times the size of the previous one — captivates the eye, while Tropical Mangrove roots appear to grow organically from the gallery walls. This vibrant new space brings the Pacific Ocean to life in unexpected and inspiring ways.
Hall of Fishes.
"Hall of Fishes" featured more than 60 tanks of Pacific fishes and invertebrates. The path along the Hall of Fishes followed the currents of the North Pacific Gyre, starting with tanks inspired by the Pacific Northwest, then tanks with organisms from California, followed by tanks with organisms from Mexico and Baja California, ending with tanks inspired by the Indo-Pacific. The largest habitat was a kelp forest habitat that is now part of "Living Seas". The habitat can be viewed live online through the Kelp Cam. The "Hall of Fishes" was closed in September, 2024 for renovations and the development of a new attraction, called Living Seas.
Tide-Pool Plaza.
Tide-Pool Plaza features three living tide pools where visitors can touch and learn about tide-pool animals with docents. Windows in the habitats provide up-close views of starfish, hermit crabs, sea cucumbers, lobsters, and other animals local to San Diego's tide pools. The tide pool overlooks La Jolla and the Pacific Ocean.
Seadragons &amp; Seahorses.
In this exhibit, Birch Aquarium promotes sea dragon conservation. In this exhibition you’ll find a multitude of fishes in the seadragon family such as seahorses, pipefish, sea dragons, etc. Birch Aquarium has focused on this species’ rehabilitation because of the impacts that climate change and poaching have on the ocean.
The exhibit features more than a dozen seahorse species and their relatives, a special seahorse nursery, and hands-on activities for all ages about seahorse biology. Birch Aquarium is a world leader in seahorse propagation, reducing the need for other zoos and aquariums to collect from the wild.
In March 2023, The Birch Aquarium's seadragon conservation program successfully bred 70 weedy seadragons. The aquarium had previously bred two seadragons in 2020, however, the event in 2023 was the first occurrence inside an exhibit.
Beyster Family Little Blue Penguins.
The "Beyster Family Little Blue Penguins" exhibit is named after the long-time supporters, Beyster Family, who generously gifted $1 million to Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Birch Aquarium. This exhibit features little blue penguins that live in an 18,000 gallon penguin lagoon that imitates the coast of Australia and New Zealand where the little blues live. It also includes a small amphitheater that allows guests to observe the penguins, as well as a "discovery cove" for children to get a closer look at these penguins.
Blue Beach.
"Blue Beach" serves as a place for people to connect with the ocean and each other. This area features a 4,500-square-foot floor mural depicting the bathymetry (or map of the depth) of the underwater canyons off La Jolla Shores, plus shark and ray viewing, comfy seating, and fun outdoor games, all surrounded by stunning ocean views.
Shark and Ray habitat.
"Blue Beach" is home to a shark and ray habitat that is a sandy bottomed outside exhibit based on the sea floor of La Jolla. This exhibit features various sharks and rays, including leopard sharks and pacific angelsharks.

Unison (song)

"Unison" is a song written by Bruce Roberts and Andy Goldmark, and first recorded by the English singer Junior in 1983 for the Tom Cruise-starred movie "All the Right Moves". A minor hit, the song would attract a good deal of attention in 1990, when three female singers each covered the song and placed it on their respective albums of that year.
Laura Branigan recorded the song for her sixth, self-titled album. Expatriate American singer Lory Bianco recorded the song for her album "Lonely Is the Night". The song's greatest success, however, would come when it was chosen to be the title track of Celine Dion's English debut album.
Celine Dion version.
Canadian singer Celine Dion covered "Unison" for her first English-language album of the same name (1990). The song was released by Columbia Records as the album's second single in Canada on 9 July 1990. The next year, it was issued as the fourth single in Japan. Dion's version was produced by Goldmark.
After its release, "Unison" received positive reviews from music critics. It was nominated for the Juno Award for Dance Recording of the Year. The song peaked at number 38 in Canada and became a success on the Canadian Dance Chart topping it for seven weeks. The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Robin Miller.
Background and release.
In 1989, Dion recorded "Can't Live with You, Can't Live Without You," a duet with Billy Newton-Davis included on his album, "Spellbound". The track was produced by Andy Goldmark. At the same time, Dion was recording her first English-language album, "Unison". Goldmark produced the title track, which was released as the second single in Canada on 9 July 1990. It was also issued as the fourth single in Japan on 4 November 1991. In the rest of the world, "Unison" was used as B-side to "The Last to Know" single.
For the single release, "Unison" was remixed by Kevin Unger. He created four remixes: single mix with rap, single mix without rap, mainstream / extended mix and club mix. Three of them feature rap by Frankie Fudge. Ruth Pointer can be heard on the background vocals. The remixes took weeks of pre-production with the ultimate goal of making the original album version into a dance pop track for both contemporary radios and club dance floors. The new versions took three days to mix at Toronto's famed Metal Works Studios.
Critical reception.
"Chicago Tribune" Jan De Knock wrote: "Dion's big voice invites comparisons to the power-pop stylings of Taylor Dayne and Laura Branigan (coincidentally, the disco-flavored title track "Unison" also appears on Branigan's latest LP.)"
Commercial performance.
In Canada, "Unison" debuted on the charts in July 1990 and peaked at number 38 on "The Record" Retail Singles Chart on 17 September 1990. It also peaked at number seven on the "RPM" Adult Contemporary Chart.
Music video.
The music video for "Unison" was made for the single mix with rap by Frankie Fudge and released in July 1990. It was directed by Robin Miller. The person who appears in the video rapping, is not Fudge. The music video was later included on the "Unison" VHS.
Live performances.
Dion performed "Unison" on a few Canadian television shows in 1990. She also sang it during her Unison Tour, Celine Dion in Concert, The Colour of My Love Tour, and also in the closing concert dubbed "Millenium Concert" of her Let's Talk About Love World Tour. It was also performed as part of a medley with contestants of Star Académie in 2009. It was also a part of a medley in her 2018 tour and the final year of her Las Vegas residency show, "Celine".
Awards and accolades.
At the Juno Awards of 1991, "Unison" (mainstream / extended mix) was nominated for the Juno Award for Dance Recording of the Year but lost to "Don't Wanna Fall in Love" (knife feel good mix) by Jane Child. It was also voted the song of 1990 in Quebec (ahead of Madonna's "Vogue") on the NRJ radio network's "Le choix du Québec". Arguably, the success of the remix was the springboard Sony Music Canada needed to garner the attention of its US parent company, leading to Dion's release in the US market.

Ben Olson

Benjamin James Olson (born February 28, 1983) is a former American football college quarterback. He played four injury-plagued seasons of college football at UCLA, starting 10 games (and appearing in four others).
Early life.
Born in Missoula, Montana, Olson grew up in Thousand Oaks, California, where he played quarterback for Thousand Oaks High School in California for four years. For three of those years, he played on the varsity team, alongside David Anderson.
Olson was considered the top quarterback prospectand even top high school football recruit in the countryfollowing a highly productive senior year in which he threw for 2,989 yards and 32 touchdowns, earning high school All-American honors in 2001.
College career.
Upon graduation in 2002, Olson signed with Brigham Young University and redshirted his freshman season. He then went on a two-year mission to Canada with the LDS Church.
In 2005 Olson transferred to UCLA, where he spent the year behind senior Drew Olson (no relation) on the depth chart after missing the opener with a fractured hand.
Olson played in five games in 2006, completing 63.7% of his passes for 822 yards, 6.63 yards per attempt, 5 TDs and 5 INTs. His season came to an end in the opening moments of his fifth start, when he tore a ligament. He did not regain the starting position that season.
Olson was named starting quarterback for the 2007 season following the spring training. However, he was again plagued by injuries and only played in 6 games, completing only 48.3% of his passes for 1040 yards, 7.08 yards per attempt, 7 TDs and 6 INTs.
Entering the 2008 season, Olson was the presumptive starting quarterback after a career-ending knee injury to Patrick Cowan, the named starter during spring practice. However, on Saturday, August 9, Olson broke his right foot and was sidelined. X-rays taken the following day revealed the fracture, a repeat of an injury he had suffered during spring practice. The foot took longer than expected to heal and he finished his college football career without playing a game that year.
Post-collegiate career.
After graduating from UCLA in 2008, Olson was invited to try out by the Philadelphia Eagles, but again broke his foot. He went un-drafted in the 2009 NFL draft.
Personal.
Ben is the son of Rick and Annie Olson and has one brother and three sisters. He married Andrea Anderson in May 2007.

The Office Christmas specials

"The Office" Christmas specials are the two-part series finale episodes of the British mockumentary comedy television series "The Office". The specials were commissioned after the series' creators, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, announced that they would not write a full third series of the show. The first 45-minute part was broadcast on BBC One on 26 December 2003, and the second 50-minute part was shown the following evening. The episodes are presented in the style of "revisited" documentaries common on British television, in which series such as "Airport" are brought back for one-off specials several years after the series concluded. David Brent (Gervais), forcibly made redundant at the end of the second series, is now a travelling salesman of cleaning supplies. Tim Canterbury (Martin Freeman) and Gareth Keenan (Mackenzie Crook) are still working at the offices of Wernham Hogg, and former Wernham Hogg receptionist Dawn Tinsley (Lucy Davis), now living in Florida, is flown back to Britain by the documentary crew to reunite with her old colleagues.
The episodes won various awards, including two British Academy Television Awards, a Royal Television Society award, and a Television Critics Association (America) award. They were also nominated for a British Comedy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award.
Plot.
Part 1.
Three years after the filming of the original documentary, its makers revisit the office to see what the staff members are doing now. After being made redundant from Wernham Hogg, David Brent (Ricky Gervais) is now a travelling salesman who, following a failed single release of a cover of "If You Don't Know Me By Now," leeches off what little fame he has in a series of demeaning nightclub appearances. Dawn Tinsley (Lucy Davis) lives in Florida with fiancé Lee (Joel Beckett), who is bouncing from job to job as they live with his sister rent-free and hidden from immigration authorities. In the office, Gareth Keenan (Mackenzie Crook) is now the general manager and Tim Canterbury (Martin Freeman) is still trapped in a job he hates with an obnoxious, pregnant desk-mate Anne (Elizabeth Berrington). Despite leaving Wernham Hogg three years ago, Brent still visits the office to see the staff and "keep up the morale". This irritates both Gareth and David's former boss Neil Godwin (Patrick Baladi). When the programme makers offer to fly Dawn and Lee back for the office Christmas party, along with the appearance of David Brent, the scene is set for a reunion.
Part 2.
Brent does not have a date for the Christmas party, but tells Neil that he does. With Gareth's help, he searches Internet romance websites for suitable women, and arranges three dates. All go badly. Dawn returns to Britain and arrives at the office. She and Tim immediately recreate old times by winding up Gareth. Brent pushes Neil's patience too far when he brings his dog into the office to show to the staff. Neil bars Brent from the office and later stops anyone who does not work for Wernham Hogg from going to the Christmas dinner. At the party, Brent anxiously awaits his fourth date. When the woman, Carol, arrives, she and Brent hit it off straight away. Lee tells Dawn that it is time to leave, and she and Tim say awkward goodbyes.
In the taxi, Dawn opens her "Secret Santa" present: an oil painting set from Tim with the words, "Never give up" written next to her sketch of him, which she had made earlier in the day. Brent walks his date to her car and she gestures through the window for him to call her. Returning to the office, Chris Finch (Ralph Ineson) insults her, and Brent tells him bluntly, "Chris, why don't you fuck off?". In the final scenes, Dawn returns to the office, having broken up with Lee, and kisses Tim. The office staff gather for a group photo. Brent asks to have a group photo of just him and the "old gang". While David, Tim, Dawn, Gareth, and the rest of the office members gather round for the photo, David makes his colleagues laugh with an impersonation of Frank Spencer.
Production.
Gervais and Stephen Merchant had announced that they would not write a third series of "The Office" even after the overwhelming success of the second. In an interview published in "Heat" in May 2003, Gervais announced that he and Merchant had begun writing a two-part Christmas special. Merchant joked that it would be the "same jokes, but with tinsel and David Brent in a Santa outfit".
The episode was filmed between August and September. Scenes set in Florida were filmed in Spain. Anne, Tim's new desk-mate, was written to be an even more annoying character than Gareth.
That November, a beauty technician from Saffron Walden called Joanne Hiley claimed to have been sent the scripts in the post by mistake. Although technically illegal in the UK, she announced to "The Sun" that she intended to sell them. The "Daily Mail" purchased the scripts and revealed most of the plot in an article published four weeks before the broadcast. In a BBC Radio 1 "Newsbeat" interview, Gervais asked for a newspaper or magazine to buy the scripts and return them to the BBC as "a little Christmas present to the nation".
Reception.
The second series of "The Office" averaged four million viewers per week when it was broadcast on BBC Two. To get as many viewers as possible for the Christmas specials, the BBC's director of television Jana Bennet allowed it to be moved to BBC One. The ratings were deemed a success by the BBC; Part 1 received 7.17 million viewers and a 30.97% share of the audience, and Part 2 received 6.14 million viewers and a 25.66% share. Part 1 was the third most popular programme on Boxing Day for 16- to 34-year-olds.
A "clerical error" at the BBC meant Gervais was initially omitted for consideration for a British Academy Television Award for Best Comedy Performance in 2004. Crook, Freeman and Davis were all long-listed for the award. A last-minute reprieve allowed Gervais to be included on the list, and he went on to win the BAFTA for Best Comedy Performance. Freeman had also been shortlisted. The specials themselves won in the Best Situation Comedy category. The award was presented to Gervais, Merchant and producer Ash Atalla. At the Royal Television Society Programming Awards, the specials won in the Situation Comedy and Comedy Drama category. The RTS jury commented "The problem of writing a final episode of a much-loved comedy was fully resolved. Tim gets Dawn. Dawn gets her oil paints. Brent gets the girl and we are carried along with it all. Perfection!" Gervais was also nominated in the Comedy Performance category. The specials were nominated for Best TV Comedy at the British Comedy Awards, but lost to "Little Britain", though Gervais and Merchant won the Writer of the Year award.
The specials were broadcast in the United States on 21 October 2004. BBC America merged both parts into a single 95-minute episode entitled "The Office Special". The making-of documentary "How I Made the Office", previously released on the Series 1 DVD, was broadcast after the special. In a preview in "The Hollywood Reporter", Cynthia Littleton highlighted the scene where Brent tells Carol that the documentary crew edited his antics to make him look like a fool as being true to life, comparing it to the various real-life lawsuits filed by "Survivor" contestants against CBS. Littleton also commented positively on the scene where Gareth asks Brent to "call ahead", and Brent's music video. In "The New York Times", Alessandra Stanley wrote that the specials are "as wickedly, painfully funny as the first two seasons and, in tiny, fleeting doses, as delicately tender".
The following year it was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Made for Television Movie. Gervais and Merchant received a nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special. The episodes won in the Outstanding Achievement in Movies, Mini-series &amp; Specials category at the American Television Critics Association Awards. The award was collected by Lucy Davis.
The specials appeared at No. 4 on Channel 4's "100 Greatest Christmas Moments" polls in 2004.
Home media.
The specials were released on VHS and DVD in the UK on 25 October 2004 by BBC Video. Extra features include an audio commentary on Part 2 by Merchant and Gervais, a retrospective documentary entitled "The Office: Closed For Business", the full video for Brent's version of "If You Don't Know Me By Now", a featurette about the cast and crew collecting the Golden Globes, and a studio version of "Free Love Freeway"—Brent's song from Series 1, Episode 4. It was released in the United States on 16 November 2004 with the same special features.

Blatná

Blatná (; ) is a town in Strakonice District in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 6,700 inhabitants. It is known for a water castle with a surrounding moat, and a landscape garden around it. The historic town centre with the castle complex is well preserved and is protected as an urban monument zone.
Administrative division.
Blatná consists of nine municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):
Etymology.
The name Blatná is derived from the Old Czech word "blata" (meaning 'marshes'). It got its name from the marshlands among which it was founded.
Geography.
Blatná is located about north of Strakonice and southeast of Plzeň. It lies in the Blatná Uplands. The highest point is at above sea level. The Lomnice River flows through the town. The municipal territory is rich in fishponds, built here since the Middle Ages. The municipality of Mačkov forms an enclave in the territory of Blatná.
Climate.
Blatná enjoys an inland version of temperate Oceanic climate (Cfb) with rather balanced temperatures year round. Precipitations are vastly in form of rain, totalling 691 mm. There are four pronounced seasons with notably cold, dry, and murky winter season, contrasting with much sunnier and wetter warm seasons. Average round the clock temperatures in July stays on +17.2 °C and January mean temperatures stays on −2.5 °C. The whole year average is .
History.
The first settlement of the area is documented by archaeological finds up to the 4th century. In the 8th and 9th centuries, a Slavis settlement is documented. The first written mention of Blatná is from 1235, when there probably already existed a keep with a settlement. In the 14th century, Blatná became a property of the Bavors of Strakonice family, which leads to the development of the settlement.
The importance of Blatná grows especially in the 15th and at the beginning of the 16th century, when Blatná became the centre of the dominion of the family of Lev of Rožmitál. Their long rule marks the golden age of Blatná. At that time, the burghers of Blatná gained the privileges that enabled the development of handicraft production and the growth of the business – the right to organize markets and brew beer. In the second half of the 16th century, Blatná was owned by the Sternberg family for a short time until it was bought by the Polish Counts of Rozdražov. In 1601, Blatná was promoted to a town by Emperor Rudolf II.
During the Thirty Years' War, Blatná was repeatedly looted and destroyed. In 1691, the Kolowrat-Krakowsky family bought Blatná, but they sold it to the Serényi family already in 1695. In the 18th century, during the rule of the Serényis, the town recovered and prospered. Since 1798, Blatná has belonged to the Tyrolean house by origin of Hildprandts of Ottenhausen. They have owned the castle continuously, with the exception of the period of communist dictatorship (1948–1989) when it was confiscated by the state.
The town burned down completely in 1834; 118 houses, the town hall and the bell tower were destroyed and therefore most buildings in the town come from after that event. At that time Blatná fell to one of the poorest towns. In 1858, the town once again recovered and became a district town. The town's economy further developed after the railway to Strakonice and Březnice was built at the end of the 19th century.
Economy.
The largest employers in Blatná are Dura Automotive CZ (manufacturer of automotive components), Leifheit (household products manufacturer) and Tesla Blatná (manufacture of electronics for cars).
Transport.
The I/20 road (part of the European route E49) from Písek to Plzeň passes through the town.
Three railway lines start and terminate in Blatná: to Strakonice, Beroun and Nepomuk.
Education.
There are three primary and two secondary schools in town.
Sights.
Blatná Castle.
Blatná Castle is the town's main landmark. It is built on a rock surrounded by a moat, connected with a pond. The castle is narrow, U-shaped, with a tower in front to which the palaces from various periods attach. The castle is being restored with most of the works finished. It is open for the public, together with the castle park and deer park.
Under the Lev of Rožmitál family, the fortress was for the first time rebuilt in stone (the oldest parts being the tower and Rožmitálský Palace) and the surrounding marshes were changed into wide water trenches. A Gothic chapel was soon attached to the tower and palace. Lords of Rožmitál were continuously rebuilding and enlarging the castle, first with the so-called Old Palace, standing separatedly over the remnants of a Romanesque chapel. In 1523–1530, during the rule of Zdeněk Lev of Rožmitál, a new palace in a mixed Gothic-Renaissance style was appended under the guidance of renowned royal builder Benedikt Rejt and now is called Rejt's Palace.
During the rule of the Counts of Rozdražov, the Renaissance Rozdražovský Palace was built and became the last part of the castle. In the 18th century, the Serényi family had one wing of the castle rebuilt in the Baroque style and also erected many Baroque statues in the town and its surroundings. In 1850–1856, the castle received its last rebuilt, which gave it its contemporary neo-Gothic look.
Castle park.
The castle park spreads next to the castle on an area of . The park was created as an English landscape garden at the beginning of the 19th century by František Hildprandt. Its part close to the castle surrounds a large meadow with very old solitary oak trees. Beyond the meadow are preserved old woods with alleys, swamps, streams with footbridges over them, artificial caves, remnants after placer mining and an Empire style summer house. Its part is also a deer park. A herd of tame fallow deer freely roams the park.
Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.
The Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary lies next to the castle, at the end of the main square. It was founded in the 1290s as a two-aisled building with a long presbytery, and small adytum on the north side. It gained its present looks in 1515 when the reconstruction was finished.
The bell tower is located next to the church. It was first built in 1722–1723 and was high. It was destroyed with most of the town in the big fire of 1834, but was built again in 1835–1836, this time at of height.
J.A. Comenius primary school.
The building of the primary school that carries the name of J. A. Comenius was built according to the design of the local native, architect Karel Fiala, in 1902–1904.

National Skill Standards Board

The National Skill Standards Board (NSSB) was a coalition of community, business, labor, education, and civil rights leaders. It was tasked with building a national voluntary system of skill standards, assessment, and certification to enhance the 
ability of the United States workforce to compete effectively in the global economy.
History.
NSSB gathered research on the creation of skill requirements, skill assessments, and certification processes. The board developed research protocols for validating skills across an entire Industry, the development of quality criteria for all elements of that system, and the designs for a continuous improvement strategy.
In 2001, the Manufacturing Skill Standards Board (MSSC) released "A Blueprint for Workforce Excellence" the nation's first skill standards developed under a common format and common language for all sectors of manufacturing. The skill standards represent the best practices for high-performance work and define the skills and knowledge required to ensure a skilled, mobile industrial workforce. 
The standards include national validation of the specific job functions in best practice work sites which when the job is completed successfully. They also establish the level of technical knowledge and skills needed for the job. The three distinct levels of skill standards: core, concentration and specialized.
In 2003, federal entity NSSB became The National Skill Standards Board Institute (NSSBI). This was a membership foundation which would continue research and development related to the development and use of Industry skills requirements, skills assessment for learning or selection, and certifications.
David Wilcox, the Deputy Director of the NSSB in 2003, founded a new firm called Global Skills X-Change (GSX), that equips organizations and the workforces they rely on with the tools, programs, and capabilities to adapt to today’s rapidly changing conditions
Workforce categorization.
The NSSB categorized the entire United States’ workforce into just 15 industry sectors. Those sectors include:
The National Skill Standards Act of 1994.
The National Skill Standards Act of 1994 established "a National Skill Standards Board to serve as a catalyst in stimulating the development and adoption of a voluntary national system of skill standards and of assessment and certification of attainment of skill standards:"
$15,000,000 was authorized for fiscal year 1994 for this act.

The Hallo-Wiener

The Hallo-Wiener is a children's book by Dav Pilkey and published on September 1, 1995, by The Blue Sky Press. 
The story's main character is a dachshund named Oscar, who is named after Oscar Mayer. 
Plot.
The story begins with Oscar, a dachshund who is described as "half-a-dog tall" and "one-and-a-half dogs long". Oscar is tired of the other dogs making fun of him because of his wiener-shaped body. He is now happy because it is Halloween and he cannot wait to get a costume. At obedience school, he daydreams of Halloween. When he comes home from school, his mother has a surprise for him: a hot dog bun costume with "mustard" in the middle; Oscar is supposed to fit in the middle. He shows concern about getting laughed at, but wears the costume anyway, because he does not want to hurt his mom's feelings. He sees the other dogs showing off their costumes. When they see Oscar's costume, they howl in laughter.
Oscar's costume is so heavy that it slows him down. Meanwhile, the dogs are getting their all the candy and when Oscar comes to the houses there are no more treats left. The dogs go to a graveyard, and they hear a noise. They scream very loud and run, diving into a river because they see a scary monster. When Oscar comes to see the monster, he notices something strange. He bites the cover of the monster, pulls it off, and discovers two cats hiding underneath. The cats scream and run away. Then Oscar jumps into the water and uses his costume as a life raft and rescues the other dogs. The dogs thank Oscar by sharing their candy with him. They become friends and Oscar is never made fun of again, for he is then known as "Hero Sandwich".

Viewliner Train of Tomorrow

The Viewliner Train of Tomorrow was a narrow-gauge, miniature train that once operated alongside portions of the Disneyland Railroad main line.
The attraction commenced operation on June 10, 1957 and was billed by Disneyland as "the fastest miniature train in the world." Two separate trains, designed by Disney Imagineer Bob Gurr and built as scale replicas of General Motors' futuristic "Aerotrain", traveled along a dog-bone track circuit (rail line with a turnaround loop at each end) through parts of Tomorrowland and Fantasyland. The Tomorrowland train featured cars that were named for the planets, while the cars of the Fantasyland train were named after various Disney characters.
The modern, streamlined trains were placed into service to represent the future of rail travel, in contrast to the steam-powered Disneyland Railroad, which represented its past. Motive power for each train consisted of an integral head-end unit driven by an Oldsmobile "Rocket" V8 gasoline engine, mated to a Jeep transfer case powering drive-shafts to both the front and rear wheel trucks. Two 1954 Oldsmobile 88 2-door coupes furnished the windscreen, doors and instrument console for each of the two locomotives. The attraction operated until September 30, 1958, when construction began on the Matterhorn and Submarine Voyage. The Disneyland Alweg Monorail System ultimately took the place of the "Viewliner" in June 1959, thereby making it one of the shortest-lived rides in the park's history. The railroad ties from the attraction were later used to build the Deer Lake Park &amp; Julian Railroad, a narrow-gauge backyard railroad owned by Disney animator Ollie Johnston at his vacation home near Julian, California.

A former forward, throughout his playing career, he played for Uruguayan side Nacional, as well as Italian clubs Cagliari, Napoli, Roma, Juventus, and Como, and Argentine side River Plate, winning titles with both Nacional and Juventus. At international level, he represented Uruguay on 30 occasions between 1990 and 1997, scoring 11 goals, and also took part at the 1990 FIFA World Cup and the 1995 Copa América, winning the latter tournament.
Club career.
Fonseca, nicknamed "el castor" ("the beaver"), started his football career at Nacional, his local team in Uruguay, in 1988. He played 14 games in two years and scored 3 goals.
In 1990, he moved to Cagliari, scoring 17 goals in 50 appearances, playing mostly on the left rather than in his more habitual central position.
In 1992 Napoli signed him and Fonseca managed a more impressive strike rate, scoring 31 goals in two seasons in Naples, including 5 goals in a 5–1 win against Valencia in the first knock-out round of the UEFA Cup on 16 September 1992. His form and performances drew attention from Roma, who promptly signed him in 1994.
During his time with Napoli, he would occasionally put on the socks of the Uruguay national team, which is a shade lighter in colour than Napoli's socks, saying that they would bring him good luck.
However, his three seasons (from 1994 to 1997) were far from successful. Fonseca usually played as a second striker, supporting the Argentine centre forward Abel Balbo, but, because of the many injuries he suffered, he played discontinuously.
Juventus signed Fonseca in 1997, but he was once again played out of position on the left wing, as he had been at Cagliari and Roma. His goalscoring record in Serie A was very good considering he was not always a first choice player with Roma and Juventus. Fonseca was always regarded as a "super sub", and scored several important goals coming off the bench. During his time with the Turin club, he won one Serie A title, a Champions League runner-up medal and the Supercoppa Italiana.
Injuries ruled him completely out of the 1999–2000 season, (aside from an UEFA Cup match against Levski Sofia on 4 November 1999, which ended in a 1–1 home draw, and a Coppa Italia match against Napoli on 16 December 1999, which ended in a 1–0 home win), which saw him transferred to River Plate in Argentina. There, he infamously played only during the club's 2000 pre-season. His only match was a pre-season encounter against archrivals Boca Juniors, and Fonseca helped his club to earn a win by scoring the final penalty in the shootout. A few days later, Fonseca would resign from his contract and join Como in 2001. He retired in 2003 after the coach told him that he was no longer a part of the first team's plans.
International career.
Fonseca represented the Uruguay national football team on 30 occasions between 1990 and 1997, scoring 11 goals. He was a member of the team that took part at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, scoring in injury time in the final group game against South Korea, and was also in the squad that won the 1995 Copa América.
Style of play.
Fonseca was a quick, opportunistic, and hard-working striker, with good dribbling skills, vision, and a powerful shot from distance. This made him capable of both scoring goals and creating chances for teammates. A versatile and well-rounded attacker, Fonseca was also effective in the air, and was capable of playing in several offensive positions. His pace, technique, defensive work-rate, and passing ability meant he could play on the left wing, as well as in a central role, or even in a more creative role as a second striker alongside or behind another striker. He was also an accurate penalty kick and set-piece taker. Despite his ability, however, he was also injury prone.
After football.
Fonseca currently works as a football agent, and has represented several of his compatriots, including Martín Cáceres, Fernando Muslera, and Luis Suárez.
Personal life.
Daniel is the father of footballers Nicolás Fonseca and Matías Fonseca.
Controversies.
In April 2016, he was named in the Panama Papers.

History.
In Veszprém there was a long tradition of handball, and in 1970 the Bakony Chemist TC women's team won the first championship among the rural ensembles. The sports club was founded in 1977 under the wing of the Veszprém County State Construction Company (VÁÉV) under the name Of Veszprém Builders, after a political decision was taken in the city, which urged the men's division of BVTC, which had been relegated from NB II, to be taken over by the VÁÉV.

2006 Turkish motorcycle Grand Prix

The 2006 Turkish motorcycle Grand Prix was the third race of the 2006 Motorcycle Grand Prix season. It took place on the weekend of 28–30 April 2006, at the Istanbul Park circuit. The 250cc race saw a number of riders eliminated at the first corner.
MotoGP race report.
This race was most notable for its thrilling ending, where Italian satellite Gresini Honda rider Marco Melandri overtook the Australian rookie Casey Stoner at the last corner, denying him his first ever win.
After two rounds, Loris Capirossi led the championship at this point, followed by the Repsol Honda riders Nicky Hayden with 36 and rookie Dani Pedrosa with 30 points. Valentino Rossi - last year's champion - only sat in fourth with a mere 27 points.
Chris Vermeulen took the pole position on Saturday - his first ever - followed by Nicky Hayden in second place and Sete Gibernau in third. Rossi only managed to qualify in a lowly eleventh position, and needed a strong result to stay in the title fight.
As the lights went out, Vermeulen kept his lead as the pack all took off with no problems or incidents. After about half a lap, Vermeulen still led, with Hayden losing two places and dropping to fourth. Gibernau moved up one place (third to second) and John Hopkins two (fifth to third), as did Casey Stoner (seventh to fifth). Melandri meanwhile recovered a whopping eight positions, with Valentino Rossi only making up one place (eleventh to tenth). During the opening lap, Gibernau overtook Vermeulen - making good use of the speed of the Ducati - and moved past to open up a small gap. However, at Turn 12, Vermeulen retook the lead from Gibernau, using the better cornering speed of his Suzuki to his advantage, to lead the race again going into lap two. Rossi also overtook the Kawasaki of Randy de Puniet for the ninth position.
By lap two, Gibernau overtook Vermeulen on the start/finish straight, with the other Suzuki of Hopkins following suit, relegating Vermeulen to third. Behind them, Stoner made quick work of Nicky Hayden and took fourth from him. Rossi meanwhile ran wide at Turn 7, making him drop back all the way to fourteenth after he made up a few places. At Turn 12, Hayden tried to overtake Stoner but ran wide, allowing Marco Melandri to overtake him in return and Stoner to swoop past both of them to reclaim fourth. 
Lap three and Gibernau started to form a small gap to Hopkins, with Vermeulen still in third. Rossi overtook Makoto Tamada for thirteenth around halfway the third lap.
On lap four, Stoner shadowed Vermeulen's moves and overtook him at Turn 7 for third place. Vemeulen tried to fight back in acceleration, but by Turn 8 he was relegated to fourth, with Melandri ramping up the pressure as well after Melandri also took fifth from Hayden. Gibernau and Hopkins meanwhile opened up a significant gap to Stoner. Rossi meanwhile overtook Shinya Nakano for twelfth on the straight before Turn 9. Before Turn 12, Melandri overtook Vermeulen - who started to have tyre problems -, with Hayden following suit at Turn 14. 
By lap five, the Bridgestone shod Ducati of Gibernau and Suzuki of Hopkins had a one-second lead over Stoner, Melandri, Hayden and Vermeulen, with Stoner's Michelin shod LCR Honda slowly catching up. Rossi was still twelfth. At Turn 12, Hayden overtook Melandri for fourth. Rossi also overtook de Puniet for the eleventh spot.
On lap six, Pedrosa overtook the Yamaha of Colin Edwards for eighth on the start/finish straight. José Luis Cardoso rode into the pits to retire his bike during this lap, choosing not to finish lap five. Rossi crossed the line in tenth after he overtook Toni Elías.
Lap seven and the top runners consist out of Gibernau, Hopkins, Stoner, Hayden and Melandri, with a +1.1 second gap back to Vermeulen in sixth. Pedrosa also overtook Capirossi going into Turn 1 for seventh place. Melandri dove under Hayden at Turn 9 to snatch fourth, with Hayden taking the place back at Turn 14. Rossi is still stuck in tenth place.
Right before lap eight began, Stoner managed to get a better exit speed at Turn 14, allowing him to overtake Hopkins at the start/finish straight. Pedrosa also took sixth from Vermeulen right after them at around the same point. Hayden meanwhile tried to overtake Hopkins going into Turn 3 for third, Hopkins fighting back and forcing Hayden to go the long way around at Turn 4. Hayden held on however, using the better acceleration and traction of his Repsol Honda to eventually pull off the move going into Turn 5. Melandri used this to also force his way past at Turn 7, with Hopkins running slightly wide on exit and Pedrosa sneaking past and grabbing fifth place. Hopkins lost three positions (third to sixth) in just four corners. Both Hayden and Pedrosa use the superior top speed of their Repsol Honda's to try and overtake Stoner and Melandri for second and fourth, but run wide exiting Turn 12, allowing Stoner and Melandri to keep their positions going into Turn 13. However, Stoner himself went a bit too wide and Hayden managed to snatch second from Stoner going into Turn 14.
On lap eight, Gibernau still led, albeit with an ever slimmer margin (+0.7 seconds). Rossi meanwhile still did not manage to move up, as he has a +2,9 second gap to his teammate Edwards. 
Lap nine and Stoner took second at Turn 7, with Hayden taking the place back at Turn 8. Stoner himself then got overtaken by Melandri for third place at Turn 12.
By lap ten, Stoner lost yet another position, this time to the other Repsol Honda of Dani Pedrosa, who overtook him on the start/finish straight for fourth. Melandri overtook Hayden for second at Turn 9, with Pedrosa doing likewise at the straight before the entrance to Turn 12 for the third spot.
On lap eleven, Melandri overtook the struggling Gibernau going into Turn 1. Rossi moved and moved up to ninth after Hopkins fell back to eleventh, and closed the gap to Edwards. Pedrosa also swooped past on the inside at Turn 3 to take second from him, with Hayden trying the same at Turn 4 but failing. Hayden however succeeded when he took a shorter entry going into Turn 8, overtaking Gibernau for third. Going into Turn 9, Stoner then also took Gibernau's fourth place, relegating him to fifth in just a few corners. Pedrosa tries to overtake Melandri for the lead going down into Turn 12, but overshoots and loses the place to Melandri, who retakes the lead going into Turn 13.
Lap twelve - just over the halfway point - and the top six is as follows: Melandri, Pedrosa, Hayden, Stoner, Gibernau and Vermeulen, with a +1 second gap back to Capirossi. Rossi meanwhile has managed to overtake Edwards on the start/finish straight for eighth place, with Elías doing likewise for ninth. However, he still had a +2,9 second gap to seventh place Capirossi to make up by then. Hopkins meanwhile went into the pits to change his rear tyre, dropping him back all the way down to last place. Vermeulen overtakes Gibernau going into Turn 9, relegating him to sixth. Unlike last lap, Pedrosa manages to overtake Melandri going into Turn 12.
On lap thirteen, Rossi cut the gap to Capirossi to +1.8 seconds. Hayden overtook Melandri for second going into Turn 12, but goes just a bit too wide. As Melandri tries the cutback, he bumps into Hayden, allowing him to keep the position going into Turn 13 and 14. 
Lap fourteen and it is Repsol Honda 1–2, followed by Melandri and Stoner. Pedrosa starts to pull a gap to his teammate Hayden and James Ellison entered the pits to change his Dunlop tyres. Rossi caught Gibernau - who in turn already was overtaken by teammate Capirossi - and overtook him for seventh place at Turn 9, with Elías following suit before the start/finish straight. Alex Hofmann has also retired.
On lap fifteen, Rossi managed to overtake Capirossi for sixth position at Turn 3. No overtakes happened at the main four, which are Pedrosa, Hayden, Melandri and Stoner.
Going into lap sixteen and both Pedrosa and Hayden start to create small gaps to each other and Melandri. Rossi overtook Vermeulen at Turn 9 and is up until fifth place.
Lap seventeen and both Hayden and Melandri have closed the small gaps. While Rossi is up into fifth, he still has a +6,7 gap to fourth place Stoner, making a podium finish highly unlikely for him. Melandri meanwhile made a surprise move on Hayden at Turn 7, forcing him to go a bit wide and snatching second place from him. Stoner made his move in turn at Turn 9, forcing Hayden to go wide as a result. Melandri then overtakes Pedrosa with more speed at the straight before Turn 12, taking over the lead at the front.
Going into lap eighteen and Stoner makes good use of a small mistake of Pedrosa, who kept his front wheel in the air and lost some speed as a result, overtaking him for second on the start/finish straight. Stoner takes over the lead from Melandri by overtaking him at Turn 12.
On lap nineteen, no overtakes happened at the front. Hayden went wide going into Turn 12, making him lose touch with the top three (Stoner, Melandri and Pedrosa). When exiting Turn 14 however, Melandri went slower than usual - possibly because of a missed gear, allowing Pedrosa to snatch second place from him at the beginning of the start/finish straight.
Lap twenty and Hayden is dropping back significantly, possibly due to tyre problems. Melandri overtakes Pedrosa for second place before Turn 12.
The penultimate lap - lap twenty-one - has begun and Stoner is still leading, followed by Melandri and Pedrosa. Hayden is +1.4 seconds behind in fourth and Rossi +4.8 seconds back in fifth. Pedrosa tries to overtake Melandri for second again at Turn 12, but he blocks Pedrosa off and forces him to try via the outside as they go into Turn 12. He runs wide as a result when he enters Turn 13 and by Turn 14, he has lost ground to the top two.
On lap twenty-two - the final lap -, Pedrosa crashes out of third position when his front tyre let go, going into Turn 1. This gifts Hayden third, Rossi fourth and Elías fifth. Melandri was all over the back of Stoner but he did not make a mistake, making his first ever win seem ever more likely. However, as Melandri closed up on the straight before Turn 12, he made his move going into the turn. Stoner tried to hold out so he could retake the lead going into Turn 13, but Melandri outsmarted him and managed to get ahead. With Stoner not able to make a move at Turn 14, Melandri crossed the line +0.200 seconds ahead of Stoner to win the race - a back-to-back victory for him. +5.2 seconds behind them is Hayden, who crossed the line in third, Rossi - who had almost caught Hayden - in fourth and Elías in fifth. Pedrosa crossed the line in a lowly fourteenth place, being able to get back up on his bike after the fall.
During the parade lap back to the pits, Melandri and Stoner congratulated each other and Rossi and Stoner shook hands on the bike. Melandri did a wheelie whilst riding back to parc fermé.
At parc fermé, Hayden talks to his team whilst Melandri celebrates with much joy instead. Stoner is already interviewing the press by then. Stoner and Melandri also shake hands and hug each other.
Before the podium celebrations, the three rides shake each other's hands. The riders come on, the important figures shake their hands, the trophies are being handed to each driver, the Italian nation anthem starts playing and then the riders spray the champagne. 
Due to this result, Nicky Hayden takes over the world championship lead from Loris Capirossi by just one point - 52 to 51 -, with Marco Melandri in third place with 45 points. Casey Stoner moves up to fourth with 41 and Valentino Rossi drops one place with 40 points.

Newcastle West Town F.C.

Newcastle West Town F.C. is a youth association football club based in Newcastle West in the Republic of Ireland. It was formed in 2017 by the merger of 
Newcastle West A.F.C. (founded 1948 as a senior men's club) and NCW Rovers (founded 1987). As of 2024, the club fields a team in the Premier Division of the Limerick Desmond League. The club plays its home games at Ballygowan Park.
History.
The club was founded in 1948 and was originally called Newcastle United. They were founding members of the Limerick Desmond League in 1955, and were its first champions. In 1985 they became one of the founding members of the League of Ireland First Division, finishing eighth in their first season in the league. The following season the club adopted the name Newcastle West A.F.C. (sometimes listed as Newcastlewest).
During their spell in the League of Ireland, the club twice reached the quarter-final of the FAI Cup, in 1988 and 1990. The first occasion was controversial; they faced Cobh Ramblers in the fifth round. The first match was drawn, and Newcastle West won the replay on their own ground 4–2 after extra time. According to the "Irish Times"' correspondent, "the style they put on in this nail biting thriller that produced four stunning goals in extra time made one wonder just why such a fine football side was having its troubles at league level." However, Cobh's protest, on the grounds that their former player Billy Daly had signed for Newcastle West too late to be eligible to play in the match, was upheld by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) and Cobh were awarded the tie. In response, Newcastle West decided to pull out of the League with immediate effect. After urgent meetings involving all parties, a compromise was reached which saw Newcastle West remain in the league and the cup game replayed again. This time Newcastle West beat Cobh 1–0, with Daly scoring the winning goal, but lost to Longford Town in the quarter-final and missed out on a potentially lucrative semi-final meeting with Derry City. In the 1989–90 season, they produced "a shock victory" away to Sligo Rovers in a match where "high-flying tackles and off-the-ball confrontations marred the day", before losing at home in the quarter-final to intermediate club St Francis, who had already knocked out two other League of Ireland clubs in their first FAI Cup campaign.
After finishing ninth in the 1989–90 League of Ireland First Division, the club resigned from the league in order to make improvements to their Demesne ground, and were replaced in the league by St James's Gate. They had continued to run a team in the Limerick Desmond League and promptly won that league's top tier for four consecutive seasons between 1989–90 and 1992–93. The top tier was renamed from Division One to the Premier Division the following season but it wasn't until 2001–02 that Newcastle West captured their next league title. The club went on to secure three more titles that decade, winning the league in 2005–06, 2007–08 and 2008–09. A further title was won in 2012–13.

Ramappa Temple

Ramappa Temple, also known as the Rudreshwara Temple, is a Kakatiya style Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, located in Palampet village, Mulugu district, Telangana, India. It is from Mulugu, from Warangal, from Hyderabad. An inscription in the temple says it was constructed in the year by Recharla Rudra—a general of Kakatiya ruler Ganapati Deva (). Located in the vicinity of Ramappa Lake, the Ramappa Temple complex which consists of three temples was constructed between 1212 and 1234, designed by Ramappa — after whom the temple complex is named. Marco Polo, during his visit to the Kakatiya empire, supposedly called the temple "the brightest star in the galaxy of temples". In July 2021, Ramappa Temple was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Structure.
Ramappa Temple stands on a high star-shaped platform. The hall in front of the sanctum has numerous carved pillars that have been positioned to create an effect that combines light and space wonderfully. The temple is named after the sculptor Ramappa, who built it, making it the only temple in India to be named after its craftsman.
The main structure is in a reddish sandstone, but the columns around the outside have large brackets of black basalt which is rich in iron, magnesium and silica. These are carved as mythical animals or female dancers or musicians, and are "the masterpieces of Kakatiya art, notable for their delicate carving, sensuous postures, and elongated bodies and heads". On 25 July 2021, the temple was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as "Kakatiya Rudreshwara (Ramappa) Temple, Telangana".
Restoration by 7th Nizam.
The 7th Nizam of Hyderabad also donated towards restoration of the temple, with the restoration works starting in 1914.
In 1931, Dr. Ghulam Yazdani, the world famous Indian Archeologist and Conservationist who established Hyderabad Archaeology Department under the Nizam Government, had traced the decorations and ornaments of the temple which were missing and restored them in its original positions.
Description.
The roof (garbhalayam) of the temple is built with bricks, which are so light that they can float on water. 
There are two small Shiva shrines on either side of the main temple. The enormous Nandi within, facing the shrine of Shiva, remains in good condition.
Nataraja Ramakrishna revived Perini Shivatandavam (Perini Dance), by seeing the sculptures in this temple. The dance poses, written in "Nrtta Ratnavali" by Jayapa Senani, also appear in these sculptures.
The temple remained intact even after repeated wars, plunder and destruction during wars and natural disasters. There was a major earthquake during the 17th century which caused some damage. It survived the earthquake due to its 'sandbox technique' of laying foundation.
Many of the smaller structures were neglected and are in ruins. The Archaeological Survey of India has taken charge of it. The main entrance gate in the outer wall of the temple is ruined.
Location.
Ramappa temple is located in Palampet, Venkatapur mandal which is from Mulugu mandal (around off Warangal city). It is located away from Kota Gullu where another Shiva temple is located.

Hydroxamic acid

In organic chemistry, hydroxamic acids are a class of organic compounds having a general formula bearing the functional group , where R and R' are typically organyl groups (e.g., alkyl or aryl) or hydrogen. They are amides () wherein the nitrogen atom has a hydroxyl () substituent. They are often used as metal chelators.
Common example of hydroxamic acid is aceto-"N"-methylhydroxamic acid (). Some uncommon examples of hydroxamic acids are formo-"N"-chlorohydroxamic acid () and chloroformo-"N"-methylhydroxamic acid ().
Synthesis and reactions.
Hydroxamic acids are usually prepared from either esters or acid chlorides by a reaction with hydroxylamine salts. For the synthesis of benzohydroxamic acid ( or , where Ph is phenyl group), the overall equation is:
Hydroxamic acids can also be synthesized from aldehydes and "N"-sulfonylhydroxylamine via the Angeli-Rimini reaction. Alternatively, molybdenum oxide diperoxide oxidizes trimethylsilated amides to hydroxamic acids, although yields are only about 50%. In a variation on the Nef reaction, primary nitro compounds kept in an acidic solution (to minimize the nitronate tautomer) hydrolyze to a hydroxamic acid. 
A well-known reaction of hydroxamic acid esters is the Lossen rearrangement.
Coordination chemistry and biochemistry.
The conjugate base of hydroxamic acids forms is called a hydroxamate. Deprotonation occurs at the group, with the hydrogen atom being removed, resulting in a hydroxamate anion . The resulting conjugate base presents the metal with an anionic, conjugated "O","O" chelating ligand. Many hydroxamic acids and many iron hydroxamates have been isolated from natural sources.
They function as ligands, usually for iron. Nature has evolved families of hydroxamic acids to function as iron-binding compounds (siderophores) in bacteria. They extract iron(III) from otherwise insoluble sources (rust, minerals, etc.). The resulting complexes are transported into the cell, where the iron is extracted and utilized metabolically.
Ligands derived from hydroxamic acid and thiohydroxamic acid (a hydroxamic acid where one or both oxygens in the functional group are replaced by sulfur) also form strong complexes with lead(II).
Other uses and occurrences.
Hydroxamic acids are used extensively in flotation of rare earth minerals during the concentration and extraction of ores to be subjected to further processing.
Some hydroxamic acids (e.g. vorinostat, belinostat, panobinostat, and trichostatin A) are HDAC inhibitors with anti-cancer properties. Fosmidomycin is a natural hydroxamic acid inhibitor of 1-deoxy--xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXP reductoisomerase). Hydroxamic acids have also been investigated for reprocessing of irradiated fuel.

Tetanolysin is a toxin produced by "Clostridium tetani" bacteria. Its function is unknown, but it is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of tetanus. The other "C. tetani" toxin, tetanospasmin, is more definitively linked to tetanus. It is sensitive to oxygen.
Tetanolysin belongs to a family of protein toxins known as thiol-activated cytolysins, which bind to cholesterol. It is related to streptolysin O and the θ-toxin of "Clostridium perfringens". Cytolysins form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane that allows for the passage of ions and other molecules into the cell. The molecular weight of tetanolysin is around 55,000 daltons.

Union of Aragon

The Union of Aragon, Aragonese Union (Castilian and Aragonese: , ), or "Union of the Nobles" was an anti-royalist movement among the nobility and the townsmen of the lands of the Crown of Aragon during the last quarter of the thirteenth century. Its efforts culminated in a series of articles confirming the privileges of the aristocracy and the cities and circumscribing the power of the monarchy known as the "Magna Carta of Aragon".
The Union had its origin in the nature of the Crown of Aragon, incorporating various kingdoms at various times. The various lands vied for the attention of the monarch and struggled to protect their privileges and their influence against the rise of any other. At the same time, King Peter III was conquering Sicily and his Spanish dominions were neglected.
Eventually, Pope Martin IV called a crusade, the Aragonese Crusade, against Peter and his kingdom, dissolving his subjects of their oaths of fealty. Peter had to exact heavy taxes in order to finance resistance to the "crusade" against him. The nobles of the kingdom, believing they should have been consulted before any campaign to Sicily, formed the Union.
In 1283, the nobles and burghers of Aragon held a court (cortes) in Zaragoza at which they swore to uphold each other's rights. Within three months, the Courts of Catalonia swore a similar oath at Tarragona. At both, Peter III had to recognise the ancient customs and fueros of the people and vow to summon the cortes annually. This was known as the General Privilege ("Privilegio general").
In December 1286, the Union met at Zaragoza and then in January 1287 at Teruel. After brief talks with Alfonso III in May 1287, the Union invaded Valencia and fought some battles with the king's supporters until a Dominican prior from Zaragoza, Valero, organised a meeting in Zaragoza for 20 December. The Union forced many royal concessions from the weak Alfonso, who granted them the Privilege of the Union ("Privilegio de la unión"). The Privilege named the Union as the "true guardian of Aragonese law" in the Crown's territories. The Privilege devolved many royal functions to the lesser nobility and the Crown of Aragon nearly fell into anarchy, especially during the reign of Peter IV. Dante Alighieri placed Alfonso in his "Purgatorio", outside the gates, for his part in fostering the chaos of Europe at the time. Alfonso himself, however, was not pleased, saying "en Aragón había tantos reyes como ricoshombres."
The Privilege ordained that the king could not proceed against any nobleman without the prior permission of the Justicia acting on the approval of the cortes. This last was to be summoned annually (in November) to the city of Zaragoza. If the king ever broke his terms of the Privilege, he need not be obeyed and no act against him was to be considered treason. Thus, the king could be deposed by the nobles in extreme circumstances. By January 1288, the Union was appointing the king's councillors.
James II refused to recognise the Privileges and, by the Act of Union, made permanent the Crown of Aragon and the union of Aragon, Valencia, and Catalonia under one crown. The Aragonese union was imitated by a Union of Valencia.

Catalan counties

The Catalan counties (, ) were those surviving counties of the Hispanic March and the southernmost part of the March of Gothia that were later united to form the Principality of Catalonia.
In 778, Charlemagne led the first military Frankish expedition into Hispania to create a military buffer zone between the Frankish Empire and the Emirate of Córdoba, ocasionally known as the "Hispanic March". The territory that he subdued would in later centuries become the kernel of Catalonia (not yet known like that since the first written mention of "Catalonia" is in 1113). In 781, Charlemagne made his 3-year-old son Louis the Pious (778 – 840) king of Aquitaine, who was sent there with regents and a court in order to secure the southern border of his kingdom against the Arabs and Moors and to expand southwards into Muslim territory.
These counties were originally primitive feudal entities ruled by a small military elite. Counts were appointed directly by and owed allegiance to the Carolingian (Frankish) emperor. The appointment of heirs could not be taken for granted. However, with the rise of the importance of the Bellonids and strong figures among them such as, Sunifred (fl. 844–848) and Wilfred the Hairy (c.870-897), and the weakening of Carolingian royal power, the appointment of heirs eventually become a formality. This trend resulted in the counts becoming independent of the Carolingian crown under Borrell II in 987, starting since, to call themselves and to be known as "dei gratia comes" (counts by the grace of god) and "dux catalanensis" (Catalan dukes) or even "Hispaniae subjogator" (attorney of Hispania) and "Propugnator et murus christiani populi" (wall and defender of the Christian folk).
The many counties (aside from the counties of County of Pallars, County of Urgell and County of Empuries) were to be soon absorbed into the County of Barcelona. The Count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer IV, married the heiress of the Kingdom of Aragon, Petronilla of Aragon, in 1150, uniting as equals the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona. Thus, their son, Alfonso II of Aragon, became the king of the Crown of Aragon.
Creation.
The Frankish conquest of the area from Muslim control began in 759, shortly after the capture of Narbonne, with the establishment of the County of Rosselló, the first of what would later become the Catalan counties to be established. In 785, Rostany (or Rostaing) was made Count of Girona, the first one south of the Pyrenees. Besalú and Empúries were originally part of Girona. When Urgell and Cerdanya were conquered by Carolingian forces around 798, they were also made counties of the Hispanic March and Borrell was made count. He took a very active part in the subsequent conquest of Osona in 799 and the successful siege of Barcelona in 801. He was made count of Osona in 799, perhaps as a reward for his services. In 801, in the greatest military triumph of his long career, Louis the Pious, son of Charlamagne, took Barcelona from its Muslim rulers, making it the greatest city of the Hispanic March's littoral. The County of Barcelona was established and Bera was made its count. In 812, Count dilo of Girona (which included Besalú and Empúries) died and the county also passed to Bera.
In 804 and 805, Borrell participated in the expeditions to Tortosa, but not in the subsequent campaigns of 808 and 809. On Borrell's death in 820, Osona was given to Rampon and Urgell and Cerdanya went to Aznar Galíndez. Also in 820, Bera went into political disfavour and lost the countships of Barcelona and Girona, which also went to Rampon.
Around 813, Empúries became a separate county under Ermenguer, and in 817, it was united to the County of Roussillon. From 835 to 844, Sunyer I was count of Empúries and Peralada while Alaric I was count of Roussillon and Vallespir.
Besalú was made a separate county in 878 for Radulf on the condition that it pass to the heirs of Wilfred the Hairy on his death. It went to Miro I the Younger in 912.
Barcelona soon overshadowed the other counties in importance, especially during the reign of Wilfred the Hairy in the late 9th century. At that time, the power of the Carolingian Empire was waning and the neglected Hispanic March counties were practically independent of its royal authority. In the early 11th century, Berenguer Ramon I, Count of Barcelona, was able to submit to Sancho III of Navarre as his suzerain, even though he was still legally a vassal of Robert II of France. With the accession of Robert's father, Hugh Capet, the first non-Carolingian king, in 987, most of the counts refused to pay homage to the new dynasty. Over the next century, most of the counties were absorbed or became vassals of the County of Barcelona. In 1137, the Count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer IV received the Kingdom of Aragon and its heiress, Petronella, from the Aragonese king Ramiro II, thus uniting the County of Barcelona and its vassals with the Kingdom of Aragon to create the Crown of Aragon. After 1173, the Catalan counties, including the vassals of Barcelona, fell under the legal definition of Catalonia, which was officially defined as a principality in 1343. Several of the later Aragonese kings re-created some of the counties as appanages for younger sons.
Hereditary Rulers.
Catalan Counties under House of Pallars/Bigorre.
Successor families in the County of Upper Pallars.
In 1229, Countess Guillema of Upper Pallars sold her domains to her husband Roger I (grandson of ), with whom she had no children. The rights were transmitted to the children of Roger's other marriage, and as so with no close family connection with the Pallarese dynasty. However, if the Bigorre family and the Comminges family share an ancestor in the Ducal House of Gascony, they may have a distant relation.
In 1327, after the death of countess Sybilla, her inheritance went to her children, from the Mataplana family, which was dispossessed of the county in 1491.
The House of Trastámara and successors.
House of Trastámara (1412-1516) and the Catalan Civil War (1462-1472).
Martin died without legitimate descendants ("interregnum" 31 May 1410 – 24 June 1412). By the Compromise of Caspe of 1412 the County of Barcelona and the rest of the dominions of the Crown of Aragon passed to a branch of the House of Trastamara.
House of Bourbon (Spanish branch) 1714-1808.
In 1714, Catalonia, which had backed the Habsburg pretender to the Spanish crown Archduke Charles of Austria, was defeated in the War of the Spanish Succession by the Bourbon forces supporting Philip of Anjou's claim to the Spanish crown. Through the Nueva Planta decrees, the new Bourbon king of Spain Philip V abolished the Catalan Constitutions and merged the Crown of Aragon and the Crown of Castile to form the Kingdom of Spain. The Principality of Catalonia became another province and thus the title of the Count of Barcelona was emptied of real political power.
Since then, the numbering of the Counts of Barcelona, which had followed that of the Crown of Aragon, followed that of the former Crown of Castille. That is the reason why Philip of Anjou was called by the Catalan authorities 'Felip IV' in 1702 but called himself 'Felipe V' when he seized the title of the Count of Barcelona in 1714, after defeating the Habsburg pretender and his Catalan backers.
House of Bonaparte 1808-1813.
In 1808 Charles IV and his son Ferdinand resign from their Crown of Spain titles and transfer them to Emperor Napoleon, who kept for himself the title of Count of Barcelona. By 1812, once he had full military control over the Principality of Catalonia, he separated it from the Crown of Spain and annexed it to the French Empire.
House of Bourbon (Reannexation to Spain) 1813-1931; 1975-present day.
After the Napoleonic Wars, Barcelona returned to Spanish domain. During the 2nd Spanish Republic and Francoist Dictatorship the Bourbons remained in exile and retained their dynastic titles, including 'Count of Barcelona'.
Although on 26 July 1947, Spain was declared a kingdom, no monarch was designated until 1969, when Franco established Juan Carlos of Bourbon as his official heir-apparent. With the death of Franco on 20 November 1975, Juan Carlos became the King of Spain.

Peasants' League

The Peasants' League (in Dutch: "Plattelandersbond", PB) was a Dutch agrarian political party. The League played only a minor role in Dutch politics.
Party history.
The party was founded in 1917. In the elections of 1918, the party won one seat. It had campaigned with two lists, one religious list and one secular list, in order to appeal to both religious and secular farmers. During the First World War, the Netherlands, a neutral country, had to rely on its own agriculture. Government influence in agriculture had increased, much to the unhappiness of many farmers. The party's seat was taken by Frederik Bos. Between 1918 and 1919, the League cooperated in the neutral parliamentary party, with other four one or two seat parties, namely the Alliance to Democratise the Forces, the Economic League, the Middle Class Party and the Neutral Party. The parliamentary party was led by former minister Willem Treub. In 1919 Bos was replaced by Arend Braat as member of parliament. Braat was an unsophisticated and unconventional MP, who attempted to revoke the law on daylight saving time on five occasions but failed in each. He was ignored by most other politicians and scorned by the media for his unsophisticated behaviour. He immediately left the neutral parliamentary party.
In the elections of 1922, the party won an additional seat, this is partially explained by Braat's unconventional behaviour, which appealed to the rural voters. The party's second MP De Boer tried to replace Braat as party leader. He was removed from the party ranks and participated in the 1925 elections. Braat lost his second seat, but De Boer was unable to win a seat. After the 1929 election, the leadership of Braat became even more contested. Because of his aggressive strategy against supporters of De Boer the party's organisation was not functioning well. Before the 1933 elections, the party changed its name to National Farmers', Horticulturists' and Middle Class Party ("Nationale Boeren-, Tuinders- en Middenstandspartij", NBTM) and renewed its party organisations. In this election it had two top candidates Cornelis Vervoorn, a rich farmer, for the Northern provinces of Groningen and Drenthe and Arend Braat, who has been the party's leader for a long time, for the rest of the Netherlands. Unexpectedly Vervoorn was elected into parliament because he received more votes than Braat. Braat tried to convince Vervoorn to give up his seat, but he refused. In the 1937 election, the party lost its seat, this is partially explained by the rise of the National Socialist Movement, which was linked to a strong agrarian organisation "Agriculture and Society"
Ideology &amp; issues.
The party advocated for the interests of farmers and tried to fight the disadvantaged position of rural communities. The party saw agriculture as the primary source of wealth of the Netherlands. Its main goal was to ensure a reasonable income for farmers, to expand the farming sector and protect property rights. It wanted to abolish Daylight saving time, reduce taxation and government interference, found a ministry of agriculture, implement an old age pension, improve agricultural education, and end the merger of municipalities. The change of name in 1933 to National Farmers', Horticulturists' and Middle Class Party also implied an ideological reorientation. The party is now also oriented towards the middle class in urban areas, while still holding on to its agrarian ideals. Small businesses, or the middle class, were seen as the link between farmers and consumers. It added several proposals to its party manifesto such as a cheaper supply of credit and the regulation of advertisements.
Leadership &amp; support.
This table shows the Peasants' League's results in elections to the House of Representatives and Senate, as well as the party's political leadership: the fractievoorzitter, is the chair of the parliamentary party and the lijsttrekker is the party's top candidate in the general election, these posts are normally taken by the party's leader.
Municipal and provincial government.
The party was particularly strong in the provincial legislatives of Drenthe and Groningen. Where it also held several seats in local legislatives.
Electorate.
The electorate of party consisted out of farmers form Drenthe, Gelderland, the northern region of North Holland and the southern islands of South Holland.

History.
Borgnone is first mentioned in 1364 as "Brugnono".
In the Middle Ages it was part of the Locarno region. In the 15th century, it became a "Degagna", which was part of the bailiwick of Locarno between the 16th century and 1798. It then became an independent political municipality when the municipality of Centovalli was split in 1838.
It belonged to the parish of Palagnedra and in 1630 became a vice-parish. The Church of Beata Vergine dell 'Assunta (built 1364–65) underwent several transformations.

<doc id="6950531" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6950531" title="Odigitrievsky Cathedral">
Odigitrievsky Cathedral

Odigitrievsky Cathedral (), also known as the Cathedral of the Smolensk Icon of the Mother of God Hodegetria () is an Orthodox church, a monument of architecture of the Siberian Baroque of the middle of the 18th century in Transbaikalia. It was built in 1741–1785 in the city of Verkhneudinsk (since 1934 – Ulan-Ude)
The first stone building of the city, located in the historical center of Ulan-Ude, on the right coast of the Uda river and near its confluence with the Selenga River.  
Architecture.
The overall composition of the cathedral is three-part, symmetrical, with the components of the building strictly along the longitudinal axis from the west to east. All the objects of the temple, refectory and bell tower are merged and form a dense monolith.
Among them, the central place is occupied by a two-story column with a five-sided apse. The quadrangle is covered with a closed vault, crowned with a high dome without a roof and a light two-tiered lantern. Round pediments with four-petaled lucarnes along the axes of the quadrangle, curly kokoshniks at the corners form the competition of the walls, creating the effect of rounded corners and organically connected with the dome.
From the west, a bell tower of the “eight on four” type adjoins the refectory. A two-tiered octagon is placed above the square tiers. Each edge of the upper tier is cut through with arched openings, giving it expressiveness. The bell tower is completed with a helmet-shaped dome and a spire.
In the architecture of the facades and decorative details of the elements, there is a strong influence of Baroque forms. The decoration of the platbands is interesting by combining traditional Old Russian forms of the previous wooden cult architecture with Baroque elements. Rich plastic processing of facades with well-drawn brick details of window frames and other elements belongs to the traditions of patterned brick architecture of the 17th century, which confirms the influence of the architectural creativity of immigrants of the Russian North.  
History.
In 1700, a wooden church of the Virgin-Vladimir was built on the site of the cathedral – a small one story cemetery church with a separate bell tower. To the south of the cathedral, on the site where the old church was located, two crosses were subsequently installed.
The construction of the cathedral began in 1741 and lasted 44 years. The builders and the first abbots were Hieromonk John and priest Maxim Fedorov. The temple was built at the expense of Verkhneudinsk and Kyakhta merchants and donations from citizens. Like many Siberian Cathedrals, it was built in two stages. On May 27, 1700, St. Sophrony, Bishop of Irkutsk and Nerchinsk, consecrated the warm lower chapel in the name of Epiphany of the Lord. The upper summer chapel in the name of the Smolensk Icon of the mother of God Odigitria was consecrated on May 3, 1785, by Bishop Mikhail.
In the mid-1860s, the large bell of the cathedral had weight of 105 pounds. The oldest book in the library was the church charter of 1700, printed in Moscow. The main artistic and decorative element of the temple were gilded carved iconostases.
In 1818, cracks appeared in the foundation of the cathedral and its vault. There were more cracks after the earthquakes of 1862 and 1885. In 1863, the cathedral was completely renovated. In the 1860s, charitable organizations were opened at the temple.
At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, parochial schools were opened in 20 villages assigned to the parish of the cathedral.
During the First World War, the parish cared for the wounded soldiers and raised funds. The cathedral at that time owned 4,364 square fathoms of a farmstead in the city of Verkhneudinsk and 50 acres of arable land and lands in its suburbs.
In 1914, the parish had 1,833 male residents and 1,815 female residents.
On September 6, 1929, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Buryat-Mongolian ASSR issued a decree on the closure of the cathedral due to “the refusal of Odigitrievsk society of Believers to repair the temple”. All the church property was seized, the icons were destroyed and the building was transformed into a warehouse. The last rector of the cathedral, Gavrill Makushev, Archbishop of the Baikal region was executed in 1930. The same year, the bells were removed from the cathedral.
Construction personnel courses were organized in the church building, and since the end of 1935, an Anti-religious museum has been located in the cathedral. The museum was opened to visitors in November 1937. Until 1999, the funds of the museum of the history of Buryatia were stored in the cathedral.

Kensington, San Diego

Kensington is a neighborhood in San Diego, California. Its borders are defined by Interstate 15 to the west, Interstate 8 to the north, Fairmount Avenue to the east, and El Cajon Boulevard to the south. Its neighboring communities are Normal Heights to the west, and City Heights to the south. Kensington is part of San Diego City Council District 9. In the United States House of Representatives, Kensington was in California's 53rd congressional district prior to decennial redistricting, represented by Democrat Sara Jacobs. Due to redistricting, it became part of the 51st district after the 2022 congressional election.
History.
Kensington was founded in 1910 when a map was filed on April 9, 1910. The map contains the name of two sisters who owned the land which became the Kensington Park subdivision. Abby (Hall) Hitchcock and Mary (Hall) Gleason inherited the ex-Rancho Mission land from the estate of their deceased brother and mother. Abby's husband was a realtor, and her brother-in-law was a land use attorney and early mover-and-shaker in San Diego. Through the Hitchcock brothers, a connection was made to William Douglas, a real estate promoter from Los Angeles. Douglas' name also appears on the original Kensington Park map.
William Douglas promoted the subdivision and handled the early sales of lots. A newspaper announcement heralded the opening of the Kensington Park subdivision for lot sales on November 25, 1910. The owners had managed to convince the officials of the San Diego Electric Railway company to extend the Adams Avenue trolley line into Kensington Park in time for the opening. The first houses began to be built in 1910 and were all of the Craftsman style. The original Kensington Park subdivision stretched from Ward Canyon on the west (now SR-15), to County Line Road (now 42nd Street) on the east, and from Monroe Avenue on the south to Jefferson Avenue on the north (now Alder Drive). Kensington Park was annexed to the City of San Diego in 1952.
Sometime in 1913, the two sisters sold their interest in the Kensington Park land to a consortium of former executives from the Santa Fe Railway Company, headed by G. Aubrey Davidson. Davidson redrew the map of Kensington Park and acquired more land to the north to develop Kensington Manor. Later subdivisions followed, including Kensington Heights, Kensington Park Annex. These areas today are known collectively as "Kensington".
From its beginnings in 1910, Kensington was serviced by route 11 of the San Diego Electric Railway ( SDERy ) via a wooden trestle bridge across Ward canyon.  Automobile access from Adams was added in 1913 when a second bridge was built beside the first.  During the time of that service, the line ran several historically notable streetcar designs including the San Diego Class 1 StreetCar, one of the first "pay as you enter" designs in the nation, and "The Presidents' Conference Committee" design, both built by the St. Louis Car Company.  Streetcar service to the neighborhood continued until 1949 when the last of San Diego's street car lines were abandoned.
The name Kensington echoes the name of a district of west London. However, the origins of the name are in dispute, as the Hall sisters (Abbie Hitchcock and Mary Gleason) were originally from Natick, Massachusetts, an area where many of the street and town names resemble English place names, and some of which are echoed in Kensington street names. The area has kept its "small town" community feel ever since it was founded. Annual traditions include neighborhood-wide parties such as the Memorial Day Parade and the Fourth Of July Block Party/ Street Basketball Tournament. Also, most streets have their own "annual parties".
A neon "Kensington" sign hangs over Adams Avenue, which acts as the neighborhood's cultural and business center. This sign, after almost a year of needing repair (see picture to the right), was taken down to be replaced. However, the sign was one of only two original neon neighborhood signs remaining in San Diego, having been bought and installed by the community in 1953. A Kensington resident performed the necessary research and submitted it to the City of San Diego's Historical Resources Board for consideration as an historical resource. The HRB voted unanimously on April 24, 2008, to designate the "Kensington Neon Sign" as HRB historic site #865. As a designated historic resource, the sign had to be professionally evaluated for repair or replacement in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior Standards. The sign was found to be in repairable condition; however, the president of the Kensington Talmadge Community Association (KTCA), keepers of the sign, directed a neon sign company to dismantle the old sign, which effectively destroyed the structural integrity such that repair was no longer possible. The City's Historic Resources staff then directed the KTCA to replicate the original sign and install it back above Adams Avenue. The sign was re-installed in November 2010.
Many street names in the community have English (or New England) origins, as does the name Kensington itself. The residential area has an impressive collection of Spanish Revival style homes, this being the most popular style in San Diego during the late 1920s when much of Kensington was built out. Architects Cliff May and Richard Requa built important homes in Kensington, and Requa, in particular, had a profound influence on the architecture and character of the Kensington neighborhood. Kensington and Talmadge are sometimes, but not officially grouped together as one community for purposes to reflect higher real estate values.
Ken Cinema.
The historic Ken Theater, also known as Ken Cinema and the Ken, a one-screen movie theater, operated on Adams Avenue between 1946 and 2020. The Berkun family owned and operated the theater until 1975 when it was operated by Landmark Theatres and specialized in art house, classic-film revivals, foreign films and cult classic "midnight movies" like Rocky Horror Picture Show and The Room. In 2014, Landmark threatened to close the theater but renewed their contract "...because of the outrage to the closing of this beloved theatre." On February 22, 2020, Landmark announced that it would not be renewing its lease with the Ken. It was scheduled to screen its final "classic-films week" on March 22, but was forced to close a week early due to Governor Newsom's order to close all non-essential businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Education.
Franklin Elementary STEAM Magnet School (San Diego Unified School District) is a K-5 school located in Kensington.

Rafik Saïfi

Rafik Saïfi (; born 7 February 1975) is an Algerian retired professional football player who played as a forward or as an attacking midfielder.
Club career.
Saifi began his football career at CM Bordj El Kifane. It was there where he got a name for himself as a goal scorer at the age of 17. He went on to represent two other small teams, IRB Sougueur and IB Khémis El Khechna, before making his big move to MC Alger in his home city. There he helped the team win the Algerian league title before moving to France in 1999 at the age of 24 to join Troyes AC. He stayed with Troyes for five seasons, including the 2003–04 season after their relegation to Ligue 2.
Moving back into Ligue 1 with a transfer to newly promoted FC Istres in 2004, Saïfi played 35 matches before leaving following the club's relegation. In 2005, he joined AC Ajaccio, also newly promoted, and suffered a third relegation in four years. 
Saïfi moved to FC Lorient, yet another newly promoted club, in the summer of 2006. He started the 2007–08 campaign quickly scoring 4 goals in 4 games. 
Al Khor.
On 9 August 2009, Saïfi joined Al-Khor on a one-year contract with the club paying a transfer fee of €500,000 to FC Lorient. Saïfi scored his first goal for the club on his league debut in a match against Al-Gharafa on 12 September 2009. On 22 October 2009, he scored his second league goal, this time against Al-Kharitiyath.
Istres.
On 23 January 2010, it was announced that Saïfi would be loaned out to Ligue 2 side FC Istres until the end of the season. The move was made official on 2 February 2010.
On 4 November 2010, Saïfi signed a contract with Amiens SC.
International career.
Saïfi made his debut for the Algeria national team on 5 June 1998, in a friendly against Bulgaria, coming on as a substitute in the 65th minute. On 28 February 1999, he scored his first international goal in the 2000 African Cup of Nations qualifier against Liberia which ended as 1–1 draw. He scored his second goal in the following game, a 4–1 win in the return leg against Liberia.
Saïfi was called up by Algeria head coach Nasser Sandjak to the Algerian national team that was taking part in the 2000 African Cup of Nations in Ghana and Nigeria. In the first game against DR Congo, Saïfi started the game and was subbed off in the 70th minute, with the game ending in a goalless draw. In the second group game against Gabon, Saïfi was left out of the starting line-up and was a substitute on the bench but he did take part as he came on in the 77th minute, replacing his Troyes AC teammate Farid Ghazi. Algeria won the game 3–1. He did not take part in the final group game against South Africa. In the quarter-final against Cameroon, Saïfi was left on the bench again but came on in the 51st minute with Algeria losing 2–0. The team managed to pull a goal back in the 90th minute but lost the game 2–1. 
Saïfi was a member of the Algeria team that participated in the 2002 African Cup of Nations in Mali and started all three group games against Nigeria, Liberia and hosts Mali. Despite the fact that Algeria failed to make it out of the group stage, Saïfi put in a "best eleven" performance and was included in the team of the tournament.
Saïfi was made his third trip to the African Cup after being included by Algeria manager Rabah Saadane in the team list for the 2010 African Cup of Nations in Angola. He started in Algeria's first game against Malawi, a 3–0 loss, but was subbed off in the 63rd minute by Abdelmalek Ziaya. He started the second game against Mali, a 1–0 win, on the bench and came on in the 80th minute for Abdelkader Ghezzal.
After the FIFA World Cup 2010, he clearly announced through the Tunisian TV channel Nessma, that he was done with his international career. 
Assault incident.
After a disappointing campaign by Algeria in the 2010 FIFA World Cup in which the team received much domestic criticism,
 failing to make it beyond the group stage, a controversial incident occurred at the end of the USA-Algeria game in which the USA secured victory in the last minute. Saïfi spotted journalist Asma Halimi, a female reporter who had written an article criticizing him in the newspaper "Competition". Saïfi and the journalist had previously been in a dispute because the journalist had translated and published an interview Saïfi had given. He slapped her across the face; Halimi responded by striking him back in the face, catching her nail on his lip. Halimi stated she would file a complaint against Saïfi with governing body FIFA and the Algerian FA.

Blocking (construction)

Blocking (dwang, nog, noggin, and nogging) is the use of short pieces of dimensional lumber in wood framed construction to brace longer members or to provide grounds for fixings.
Uses.
The primary purpose of blocking is to brace longer frame members to help resist buckling under vertical compression. The intervals for the blocks are specified in the building code or as calculated by a structural engineer.
Blocking also resists the rotational movement, or twisting, of floor joists as they deflect under load. This may take the form of diagonal cross bracing, or "herringbone", bracing between floor joists. When solid blocks are used instead of diagonals it is called "bridging", "block bridging", "solid bridging" or "solid strutting". The illustration, right, shows solid blocking. Note how they are displaced alternately to allow nailing through their ends.
Blocking may also provide spacers or attachment points between adjoining stud walls, for example, where an interior and exterior wall meets, or at a corner where techniques such as the "three-stud corner with blocking" are used.
When correctly placed, blocking also provides "grounds" (also "backing" or "back blocking") for supporting the cut ends of wall claddings and linings or for attaching items such as cabinets, shelving, handrails, vanity tops and backsplashes, towel bars, decorative mouldings, etc. Properly placed grounds make the second fixings easier once the walls are lined and they distribute the weight of heavy items across structural members. However, the locations required for use as grounds are dictated by the needs of the fittings and these often do not coincide with the locations required by the engineering specifications for use as bracing, consequently, the two forms may be present in the wall acting independently. When used only as grounds rather than as bracing, they are typically shallower.
Blocking is typically made from short off-cuts or to make use of defective, warped, pieces unsuited for use in longer lengths.

116th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment

The 116th Pennsylvania Infantry was a volunteer infantry regiment in the Union Army during the American Civil War. It formed a part of the Irish Brigade.
History.
The 116th Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, was recruited from among the Irish Americans of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during the summer of 1862. Dennis Heenan served as its first colonel, St. Clair A. Mulholland as lieutenant colonel, and George H. Bardwell as major. At the end of August 1862, the regiment was ordered to report to Washington, D.C., and was assigned to the Irish Brigade, which was the 2nd Brigade,
1st Division, II Corps, Army of the Potomac. The following month, it was ordered to the Shenandoah Valley, where it saw minor skirmishing. At the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, the 116th charged up Marye's Heights. Despite losing many of their officers and men, including Colonel Heenan, they remained at the wall until dark. The regiment had lost so many men that it was consolidated into a battalion of four companies under the command of Mulholland.
The 116th performed well at the Battle of Chancellorsville, where it helped rescue the 5th Maine Battery from capture. In this action, Mulholland earned a Medal of Honor. On the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, the 1st Division was sent into the Wheatfield to support the III Corps, where the 116th engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Caught in a crossfire, the division was forced to retreat. During Pickett's Charge the following day, the regiment supported the 2nd Connecticut Battery but wasn't needed in the fighting.
During the following few months, the 116th remained in northern Virginia. In the spring of 1864, Mulholland was given permission to recruit the regiment back to full strength. Enough men were raised in Philadelphia to form Companies E, F, and G in addition to bringing the four companies at the front to strength, though many of the veterans were consolidated into A Company. Companies H, I, and K were raised in Pittsburgh. Mulholland was promoted to colonel, while Richard C. Dale became lieutenant colonel and John Teed, who had been captured at Gettysburg, major.
The 116th fought all through the Overland Campaign, where it continued to lose heavily in officers and men. Mulholland was wounded at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House and Dale was missing in action. Mulholland was wounded again at the Battle of Cold Harbor. Heavy losses continued during the Siege of Petersburg. In July, the Irish Brigade was broken up and the 116th was assigned to the 4th Brigade, 1st Division. After the Appomattox Campaign, the regiment was sent to Alexandria, where, on June 3, companies A, B, C, and D where mustered out. The remaining companies were mustered out on July 14 in Washington.

Brione sopra Minusio

Brione sopra Minusio is a municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
History.
Brione sopra Minusio is first mentioned in 1313 as "Briono".
Before 1479 Brione and Minusio formed a "Vicinanza", which also included Mergoscia until 1313. Between 1479 and 1577 it began taking steps to become an independent municipality. However, until 1952, some common property was shared between Brione sopra Minusio and other communities, which led to some conflicts.
The church of S. Maria Lauretana was built in 1558–59, and in the second half of the 19th Century it was rebuilt. Until 1662 it belonged to S. Vittore at Locarno. It was granted a chaplain in 1662 and a parish vicar in 1777.
Traditionally, the cultivation of wine, fruit, cereals and hemp as well as grazing were the main occupations of the inhabitants. They had grazing rights in the Magadino valley. The scarcity of land forced many of the residents to emigrate. In 1990 more than 75% of the workforce worked in the services sector, mostly in tourism. The municipality is home to many tourism facilities and second homes, and about 35% of the population are not native Italian speakers.
Coat of arms.
The blazon of the municipality's coat of arms is: "Azure, in base a mount of five coupeaux supporting a donkey passant argent and in chief three mullets of five points or."

Optical bistability

In optics, optical bistability is an attribute of certain optical devices where two resonant transmissions states are possible and stable, dependent on the input. Optical devices with a feedback mechanism, e.g. a laser, provide two methods of achieving bistability.
This effect is caused by two factors
Important cases that might be regarded are:
Applications of this phenomenon include its use in optical transmitters, memory elements and pulse shapers.
Optical bistability was first observed within vapor of sodium during 1974.
Intrinsic bistability.
When the feedback mechanism is provided by an internal procedure (not by an external entity like the mirror within the Interferometers), the latter will be known as intrinsic optical bistability. This process can be seen in nonlinear media containing the nanoparticles through which the effect of surface plasmon resonance can potentially occur.

Arf invariant

In mathematics, the Arf invariant of a nonsingular quadratic form over a field of characteristic 2 was defined by Turkish mathematician when he started the systematic study of quadratic forms over arbitrary fields of characteristic 2. The Arf invariant is the substitute, in characteristic 2, for the discriminant for quadratic forms in characteristic not 2. Arf used his invariant, among others, in his endeavor to classify quadratic forms in characteristic 2.
In the special case of the 2-element field F2 the Arf invariant can be described as the element of F2 that occurs most often among the values of the form. Two nonsingular quadratic forms over F2 are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension and the same Arf invariant. This fact was essentially known to , even for any finite field of characteristic 2, and Arf proved it for an arbitrary perfect field.
The Arf invariant is particularly applied in geometric topology, where it is primarily used to define an invariant of -dimensional manifolds (singly even-dimensional manifolds: surfaces (2-manifolds), 6-manifolds, 10-manifolds, etc.) with certain additional structure called a framing, and thus the Arf–Kervaire invariant and the Arf invariant of a knot. The Arf invariant is analogous to the signature of a manifold, which is defined for 4"k"-dimensional manifolds (doubly even-dimensional); this 4-fold periodicity corresponds to the 4-fold periodicity of L-theory. The Arf invariant can also be defined more generally for certain 2"k"-dimensional manifolds.
Definitions.
The Arf invariant is defined for a quadratic form "q" over a field "K" of characteristic 2 such that "q" is nonsingular, in the sense that the associated bilinear form formula_1 is nondegenerate. The form formula_2 is alternating since "K" has characteristic 2; it follows that a nonsingular quadratic form in characteristic 2 must have even dimension. Any binary (2-dimensional) nonsingular quadratic form over "K" is equivalent to a form formula_3 with formula_4 in "K". The Arf invariant is defined to be the product formula_5. If the form formula_6 is equivalent to formula_7, then the products formula_5 and formula_9 differ by an element of the form formula_10 with formula_11 in "K". These elements form an additive subgroup "U" of "K". Hence the coset of formula_5 modulo "U" is an invariant of formula_13, which means that it is not changed when formula_13 is replaced by an equivalent form.
Every nonsingular quadratic form formula_13 over "K" is equivalent to a direct sum formula_16 of nonsingular binary forms. This was shown by Arf, but it had been earlier observed by Dickson in the case of finite fields of characteristic 2. The Arf invariant Arf(formula_13) is defined to be the sum of the Arf invariants of the formula_18. By definition, this is a coset of "K" modulo "U". Arf showed that indeed formula_19 does not change if formula_13 is replaced by an equivalent quadratic form, which is to say that it is an invariant of formula_13.
The Arf invariant is additive; in other words, the Arf invariant of an orthogonal sum of two quadratic forms is the sum of their Arf invariants.
For a field "K" of characteristic 2, Artin–Schreier theory identifies the quotient group of "K" by the subgroup "U" above with the Galois cohomology group "H"1("K", F2). In other words, the nonzero elements of "K"/"U" are in one-to-one correspondence with the separable quadratic extension fields of "K". So the Arf invariant of a nonsingular quadratic form over "K" is either zero or it describes a separable quadratic extension field of "K". This is analogous to the discriminant of a nonsingular quadratic form over a field "F" of characteristic not 2. In that case, the discriminant takes values in "F"*/("F"*)2, which can be identified with "H"1("F", F2) by Kummer theory.
Arf's main results.
If the field "K" is perfect, then every nonsingular quadratic form over "K" is uniquely determined (up to equivalence) by its dimension and its Arf invariant. In particular, this holds over the field F2. In this case, the subgroup "U" above is zero, and hence the Arf invariant is an element of the base field F2; it is either 0 or 1.
If the field "K" of characteristic 2 is not perfect (that is, "K" is different from its subfield "K"2 of squares), then the Clifford algebra is another important invariant of a quadratic form. A corrected version of Arf's original statement is that if the degree ["K": "K"2] is at most 2, then every quadratic form over "K" is completely characterized by its dimension, its Arf invariant and its Clifford algebra. Examples of such fields are function fields (or power series fields) of one variable over perfect base fields.
Quadratic forms over F2.
Over F2, the Arf invariant is 0 if the quadratic form is equivalent to a direct sum of copies of the binary form formula_22, and it is 1 if the form is a direct sum of formula_23 with a number of copies of formula_22.
William Browder has called the Arf invariant the "democratic invariant" because it is the value which is assumed most often by the quadratic form. Another characterization: "q" has Arf invariant 0 if and only if the underlying 2"k"-dimensional vector space over the field F2 has a "k"-dimensional subspace on which "q" is identically 0 – that is, a totally isotropic subspace of half the dimension. In other words, a nonsingular quadratic form of dimension 2"k" has Arf invariant 0 if and only if its isotropy index is "k" (this is the maximum dimension of a totally isotropic subspace of a nonsingular form).
The Arf invariant in topology.
Let "M" be a compact, connected 2"k"-dimensional manifold with a boundary formula_25
such that the induced morphisms in formula_26-coefficient homology
are both zero (e.g. if formula_28 is closed). The intersection form 
is non-singular. (Topologists usually write F2 as formula_26.) A quadratic refinement for formula_31 is a function formula_32 which satisfies
Let formula_34 be any 2-dimensional subspace of formula_35, such that formula_36. Then there are two possibilities. Either all of formula_37 are 1, or else just one of them is 1, and the other two are 0. Call the first case formula_38, and the second case formula_39. Since every form is equivalent to a symplectic form, we can always find subspaces formula_34 with "x" and "y" being formula_41-dual. We can therefore split formula_35 into a direct sum of subspaces isomorphic to either formula_39 or formula_38. Furthermore, by a clever change of basis, formula_45 We therefore define the Arf invariant

In the First Place

"In the First Place" is a song by the English rock group the Remo Four. It was released as a single in January 1999 to accompany the re-release of the 1968 psychedelic film "Wonderwall", directed by Joe Massot. The song was written by Colin Manley and Tony Ashton of the Remo Four and recorded in London in January 1968 during the sessions for George Harrison's "Wonderwall Music" soundtrack album. Having produced the track for the band, Harrison unearthed the recording 30 years later when supplying Massot with the master tapes for the film's music. Ashton and the Remo Four's drummer, Roy Dyke, also recorded the song with their subsequent group, Ashton, Gardner and Dyke, in 1969.
A psychedelic pop song, "In the First Place" has been likened by some commentators to Harrison's 1967 Beatles track "Blue Jay Way". Massot sequenced the rediscovered recording as the opening track in his 1999 director's cut of "Wonderwall". Backed by a new mix of the song, carried out by Paul Hicks, the single was issued to help pay for the cancer treatment being undergone by Manley, who died three months after its release. In 2014, the Remo Four version was included as a bonus track on the "Apple Years" reissue of "Wonderwall Music".
Background.
Led by guitarist Colin Manley, the Remo Four were contemporaries of the Beatles in Liverpool's Merseybeat scene of the early 1960s. They then toured as a support act to the Beatles in 1964 but, despite being managed by Brian Epstein, the group failed to achieve commercial success and were without a recording contract by 1966. Late the following year, they reunited with George Harrison, who was starting his first musical project outside the Beatles – writing and recording the instrumental film score for director Joe Massot's psychedelic film "Wonderwall". Since the band were in need of work and he required backing musicians for the non-Indian portions of the film soundtrack, Harrison offered the job to the Remo Four. The group's first session for "Wonderwall" took place on 22 December 1967 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.
Recording.
"In the First Place" was written by Manley and Tony Ashton,&lt;ref name="Harry/ColinManley"&gt;Bill Harry, "Colin Manley", triumphpc.com/Mersey Beat (retrieved 2309 May 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; the Remo Four's keyboard player. The song was relatively unusual for the band, in that they were best known as a non-vocal group and had recently developed a soul-jazz sound in their live act.&lt;ref name="Lewis/First Place"&gt;Martin Lewis, "The Story of 'In the First Place'", Abbeyrd's Beatle Page, June 1999 (archived version from 11 March 2005; retrieved 29 May 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The song is in the psychedelic style typical of the era&lt;ref name="Unterberger/First Place"&gt;Richie Unterberger, "The Remo Four 'In the First Place'", AllMusic (retrieved 30 May 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; and recalls Harrison's "Blue Jay Way" in its combination of Indian and psychedelic influences. According to drummer Roy Dyke, the Indian influence was in keeping with the atmosphere during the sessions and the prevailing trend in London.
Although the 1999 single artwork lists 1967 as the year of recording, Beatles recording historian Matt Hurwitz identifies the date as 22 January 1968.&lt;ref name="Hurwitz/Wonderwall"&gt;Matt Hurwitz, "Wonderwall Music", georgeharrison.com (archived version retrieved 1 February 2021).&lt;/ref&gt; Ashton was the vocalist on the track, which Harrison produced and also played guitar and sang on. Five takes of the song were taped that day at Abbey Road, with Ken Scott as the recording engineer.
Having adopted an approach whereby he created pieces of a certain mood and length, as determined by the film, Harrison did not include "In the First Place" in the soundtrack. According to author Alan Clayson, the song was unlikely to have been considered as a possible release by the Remo Four, had they been able to secure a recording contract, given that it was such a departure from their usual style. The group disbanded later in 1968&lt;ref name="Thompson/AM"&gt;Dave Thompson, "Ashton, Gardner &amp; Dyke", AllMusic (retrieved 30 May 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; and then, without Manley, formed the trio Ashton, Gardner and Dyke. This band recorded the track – now titled "As It Was in the First Place" and with Ashton credited as the sole writer – for their 1969 album "Ashton, Gardner and Dyke". The album received little attention, although the trio went on to enjoy chart success with their 1971 single "The Resurrection Shuffle".
Rediscovery.
After its limited showings over 1968–69, "Wonderwall" earned a reputation as a lost film from London's psychedelic era&lt;ref name="Sanford/SDR"&gt;Jay Allen Sanford, "Wonderwall w/ George Harrison: Lost 1968 Psychedelic Gem Now on DVD", "San Diego Reader", 24 May 2011 (retrieved 30 May 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; and was remembered mainly for Harrison's "Wonderwall Music" soundtrack album. Among the influences Oasis adopted from the Beatles, Noel Gallagher titled their 1995 song "Wonderwall" after the album. The widespread popularity of Oasis' song encouraged Massot to revisit "Wonderwall" in November 1997 and prepare a director's cut of the film for general release. Harrison assisted in retrieving the master tapes of the musical soundtrack, so that the film's music could be presented in stereo for the first time, during which he discovered a reel containing the Remo Four's "In the First Place". In his notes to the engineers restoring the film's audio, Harrison was unable to remember who wrote the song and speculated that it had been used as "maybe a filler somewhere" in the original film.
The recording was remixed by Paul Hicks at Abbey Road Studios for inclusion in the new cut of "Wonderwall". Massot used the song over the opening credits, replacing Harrison's Indian piece "Microbes".
Release.
"In the First Place" was issued as a CD single in January 1999 on the Pilar record label. Harrison was keen to see the Remo Four fully credited for the song, particularly as Manley was in poor health, and eschewed any acknowledgement of his own contribution other than as a producer. The A-side used the mix created at Abbey Road in 1968, while the B-side contained the new, shorter "movie mix". The release was marketed as "the single from "Wonderwall"". Proceeds from the single helped pay for Manley's cancer treatment. He died in April 1999,&lt;ref name="Harry/Remos"&gt;Bill Harry, "The Remo Four", "Sixties City" (retrieved 30 May 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; two months before "Wonderwall" finally received its first public screening in the United States, as part of a 1960s film festival in Hollywood.
The single, in both CD and vinyl formats, was also available as part of a limited-edition box set that compiled the DVD of the film with collectibles related to the production. In 2014, as part of the "Apple Years 1968–75" reissues of his father's solo albums, Dhani Harrison included "In the First Place" as a bonus track on the remastered "Wonderwall Music" CD.&lt;ref name="Grow/RSonline"&gt;Kory Grow, "George Harrison's First Six Studio Albums to Get Lavish Reissues" , rollingstone.com, 2 September 2014 (retrieved 30 May 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
Critical reception.
Writing for "Mojo" in 2014, Mat Snow called "In the First Place" "amazing" and "a lysergic extra lap of the Magical Mystery Tour", referring to the Beatles' 1967 television film in which "Blue Jay Way" appeared. Richie Unterberger of AllMusic considers the song to be "decent minor-key psychedelic pop with prominent piano and heavy phasing effects", while "New Zealand Herald" critic Graham Reid describes it as "very Blue Jay Way".&lt;ref name="Reid/Wonderwall"&gt;Graham Reid, "George Harrison Revisited, Part One (2014): The dark horse bolting out of the gate", "Elsewhere", 24 October 2014 (retrieved 30 May 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
Author Robert Rodriguez views "In the First Place" as both "a creature of its time and timeless", adding that its mood and atmosphere make the track "very much in the mold of 'Blue Jay Way'". In his article on the story behind "In the First Place", Martin Lewis also comments on the similarities with Harrison's 1967 song, and he describes the Remo Four track as "an extremely strong piece of psychedelic pop" that "perfectly matched the movie's mood".

In 1264 and again in 1365, the Bishop of Como transferred part of the tithes of the Gambarogno valley, including Caviano and Scaiano, to the Magoria and Duno families from Locarno. Caviano originally belonged to the parish of Locarno, then in 1558 to Sant'Abbondio. It became a separate parish in 1850. The old church, the foundation is pre-Roman, was demolished in 1864 after the completion of the new church of S. Maria Nascente. Due to limited fishing and farming land, much of the population emigrated to other cantons or countries. The old outskirts of the village is still easily visible. In the settlement of Cento Campi, there were a number of alpine shelters and barns with thatched roofs, though most have fallen into disrepair. This type of shelter/barn was commonly used on the pastures (monti) around Lake Maggiore.
Geography.
Caviano has an area, , of . Of this area, or 5.9% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 81.9% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 7.2% is settled (buildings or roads), or 0.9% is either rivers or lakes and or 1.6% is unproductive land.

Out of the forested land, 79.7% of the total land area is heavily forested and 2.2% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 0.3% is used for growing crops and 5.0% is used for alpine pastures. Of the water in the village, 0.6% is in lakes and 0.3% is in rivers and streams. Of the unproductive areas, 1.3% is unproductive vegetation.
The village is located in the Locarno district, above Lake Maggiore. It was the westernmost municipality in the Gambarogno and shared a border with Italy at Dirinella. It consists of the village of Caviano and the hamlets of Scaiano.
Coat of arms.
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is "Per fess chief per pale argent and gules over the two a two-headed eagle displayed counterchanged and in base gules a tower with two turrets argent." The coat of arms comes from the Magoria family of Locarno and the Duni family of Ascona, both of which had feudal rights in Caviano."

Financial Management Standard

The Financial Management Standard 1997 (also known as the FMS) is a state law of the Queensland Government empowered by the "Financial Administration and Audit Act 1977 (Qld)". Its primary purpose is to provide the policies and principles to be observed in financial management, including planning, performance management, internal control, and corporate management within Queensland Government.
This is achieved by stating the functions of each accountable officer and statutory body in relation to corporate management. 
A key aspect of the FMS is its directives associated with management of information and communications technology (ICT), included the requirement for detailed ICT planning to ensure appropriate acquisition processes and ongoing management.
Unlike the United States federal law known as the Information Technology Management Reform Act (also known as the Clinger-Cohen Act), the FMS contains explicit references to the use of Enterprise Architecture. In particular the FMS links the planning of ICT directly to the Government Enterprise Architecture.
Penalties, including imprisonment, exist for failure of accountable officers to comply with the requirements of the "Financial Administration and Audit Act 1977 (Qld)" and associated regulations and the FMS.

Drexel University College of Medicine

Drexel University College of Medicine is the medical school of Drexel University, a private research university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The medical school represents the consolidation of two medical schools: Hahnemann Medical College, originally founded as the nation's first college of homeopathy, and the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, the first U.S. medical school for women, which became the Medical College of Pennsylvania when it admitted men in 1970; these institutions merged in 1993, became affiliated with Drexel University College of Medicine in 1998, and were fully absorbed into the university in 2002. With one of the nation's largest enrollments for a private medical school, Drexel University College of Medicine is the second most applied-to medical school in the United States.
The college is housed in University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the new Health Sciences Building at the main campus of Drexel University. The Health Sciences Building will be primarily used by students during their preclinical training. The MD program was formerly housed at the Queen Lane Campus, near the Henry Ave site of the former Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania. The Center City Hahnemann University Hospital Campus was the college's primary teaching hospital until its closure in 2019.
The College of Medicine follows a systems-based curriculum that is graded pass/fail. Beginning with the 2017–18 school year, the MD program transitioned into a curriculum known as "Foundations and Frontiers". Designed to train physicians that are adept at navigating the increasingly multidisciplinary healthcare system of tomorrow, this new curriculum includes essential emerging competencies such as an understanding of population health, health informatics, and health care systems and financing. To foster a greater sense of community, first year medical students are divided into six learning societies based on local iconic landmarks: Athenaeum; Liberty Bell; Physick House; Rocky Statue; Reading Terminal; and Eakins House.
History.
Drexel University College of Medicine went through many name changes throughout its history. The medical school began as two separate medical schools: Hahnemann Medical College and Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (WMCP). 
In 1848, three homeopathic physicians began operating the Homeopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania, offering M.D. and H.M.D degrees, by teaching 15 students. 
WMCP was founded in 1850 as Female Medical College of Pennsylvania but changed its name in 1867 to WMCP. It was the second medical institution in the world established to train women in medicine to earn the M.D. degree. Upon deciding to admit men in 1970, the college was renamed as the Medical College of Pennsylvania (MCP)
In 1993, the Medical College of Pennsylvania merged with Hahnemann. Hahnemann had dropped its homeopathic focus by the late 1920s.
In 2002, Drexel University assumed the leadership; this created the College of Medicine in its present form.
Hahnemann Medical College.
In 1848, three homeopathic physicians — Constantine Hering, Jacob Jeanes and Walter Williamson — opened their practice at a Philadelphia pharmacy on 229 Arch Street with the intent to practice homeopathy. With 15 students they began operating the Homeopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania, offering M.D. and H.M.D degrees. Eventually, the college became affiliated with a hospital and moved to its present location near Broad and Vine Streets. By 1928, the 20-story Broad Street location became the site of one of the first high-rise teaching hospitals in the world.
Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania.
When Hahnemann Medical College left its original site, the building on 229 Arch Street became the first home of the Female (later - after 1867, Woman's) Medical College of Pennsylvania. The New England Female College founded in 1848 but not recognized by the Massachusetts Legislature until April 30, 1850, is considered by some to be the first American medical school for women as it offered a course of medical study to women. On March 11, 1850, however, several weeks before the recognition of the New England Female College, the Pennsylvania legislature passed an act to incorporate the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania. Founded by Quaker businessmen, clergy, and physicians in Philadelphia, "Woman's Med" or MCP was thus the first medical school incorporated in the United States founded specifically to provide medical education exclusively for women. It opened its doors to the first class of women students on October 12, 1850. By 1910, the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania "remained as the only school in the United States dedicated to the education of women physicians". When it eventually became coeducational in the later part of the 20th century, it was thus the longest lasting medical school dedicated exclusively to the education of women physicians.
In its early days, female physician training was opposed by the male medical establishment both locally and from notable institutions such as the student body of Harvard Medical School. Students at the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania were jeered.
MCP Hahnemann University.
The Medical College of Pennsylvania merged with Hahnemann University in 1993, creating four fully accredited schools: the School of Medicine, Graduate School, School of Allied Health Professions, and the School of Continuing Education. In 1993, the college became the first medical school in the country to completely integrate women's health issues into its curriculum instead of an occasional lecture or optional elective. Also in that year MCP and Hahnemann University became part of Allegheny Health Education and Research Foundation (AHERF) and were integrated into the Allegheny University of the Health Sciences (AUHS), which included facilities in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, five years later AHERF, which owned eight Philadelphia hospitals, collapsed in the nation's largest bankruptcy of a non-profit health care organization.
In October 1998, in an historic reorganization, the AHERF hospitals were sold to Tenet Healthcare Corporation, a for-profit hospital corporation based in Texas. A new non-profit corporation, Philadelphia Health &amp; Education Corporation (PHEC), was created to carry on the education, research, and service missions under the name MCP Hahnemann University. Drexel University was hired as the university's operator, to bring the same level of expertise to running this academic medical center that Tenet brought to hospital management operations.
On August 3, 2000, former President Gerald Ford was admitted to the hospital after suffering two minor strokes while attending the 2000 Republican National Convention, but made a quick recovery afterwards.
Drexel University College of Medicine.
After operating MCP Hahnemann University for three and one-half years, the Drexel Board of Trustees agreed to make its relationship with MCP Hahnemann permanent. On July 1, 2002, two of the MCP Hahnemann schools—the College of Nursing and Health Professions and the School of Public Health—formally became integrated with Drexel, and PHEC continued to operate as a legal affiliate of Drexel under its new name, Drexel University College of Medicine. Shortly thereafter, the Secretary of Education for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania approved the transfer to Drexel University of all degree-granting authority that had previously been vested in MCP Hahnemann University. As a result, all students of the former MCP Hahnemann University became Drexel students and all alumni became affiliated with Drexel as well.
Today, Drexel University College of Medicine has over 1,000 medical students, more than 500 biomedical graduate students, 550 residents, 600 clinical and basic science faculty, and over 1,700 affiliate and volunteer faculty. The college offers a Woman's Health Education Program for its medical students.
Drexel University College of Medicine offered two curricular tracks for the first two years of preclinical medical education:
Location.
Queen Lane Campus.
The College of Medicine's main campus was at the Queen Lane campus of the former Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania. This campus housed first and second-year medical students as well as biomedical graduate students and is located in a suburban-like setting in the East Falls neighborhood of Philadelphia. In 2006 the university finished construction of the Student Activities Center. This new wing included an expanded gym, recreation room, book store, and an expanded lecture hall that can accommodate the entire class of approximately 260 in one auditorium.
In 2008, the university broke ground on an addition to the building: The Independence Blue Cross Medical Simulation Center. The simulation center, funded in part through a $2.5 million donation from Independence Blue Cross, features lifelike robots and screen-based simulation programs. The computer-driven robotic mannequins, called high-fidelity patient simulators, exhibit lifelike vital signs, including heartbeats, blood pressures, and body and eye movements. They can be programmed to display a variety of normal and abnormal conditions and to respond realistically to student interventions such as intubation, drug injection, or cardiac defibrillation. They can be programmed to speak or cry out in pain.
Center City Hahnemann Campus.
The Center City Hahnemann Campus, located in downtown Philadelphia, was the main site for the college's clinical education departments in addition to biomedical facilities and other health-science and public health programs. Hahnemann University Hospital anchors the Center City Hahnemann Campus, along with the Outpatient Clinics, Lecture Halls, and Residence Hall. Drexel's Office of Continuing Medical Education offers the only Physician Refresher/Re-Entry Course on the East Coast for physicians intending to re-enter the workforce after years of inactive practice. The program allows physicians to refresh their knowledge or gain additional training in order to re-enter the workforce.
In 1991, the college purchased the former Elk's Lodge BPOE No. 2 Philadelphia Athletic Club building at 306–320 N. Broad Street for $2.35 million. They demolished it the following year to redevelop the site as a parking garage and computer center. The building had been added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.
In September 2019, the hospital closed.
West Reading Campus.
Located in Berks County, Pennsylvania, Drexel University College of Medicine at Tower Health is affiliated with Reading Hospital, which is a Magnet Recognized acute care facility. In 2021, Reading Hospital became a 4-year regional campus of the College of Medicine and began training first-year medical students.
University City Campus.
In 2022, the university opened a 12-story, 460,000 square foot Health Sciences Building in University City, where the main campus is located. This building houses the University’s College of Nursing and Health Professions, College of Medicine, and Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and Professional Studies. In Aug 2023, the university welcomed first and second year MD students in its inaugural year in the building.
After the closure of Hahnemann University Hospital, there was an increased need to consolidate the various Drexel programs that were scattered across the city. 
The future of Queen Lane and Hahnemann University Center City campus is undetermined. But with the programs leaving these campuses to move to University City, the sale and closure of these campuses are a possibility.
Clinical sites.
The university offers a wide array of clinical sites to its third- and fourth-year students. Operating large urban hospitals and small rural private practices, the university provides numerous opportunities for the students to be exposed to many diverse experiences. During third-year rotations, the students have the option to stay at a particular hospital for the entire year, or rotate among all the various locations throughout the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Delaware area. Here is a partial list of the various sites:
Notable alumni.
The Drexel University College of Medicine and its predecessor medical schools have graduated physicians such as Susan La Flesche Picotte, the first Native American female physician; Anandi Gopal Joshi (the first Indian female physician in the United States); Tabat M. Islambooly (the first Syrian female physician in the United States); Rebecca Cole, the second African-American female physician in the United States; Patricia Robertson, a NASA astronaut and physician; and Sandra Lee, a dermatologist who became an Internet celebrity and star of the TLC TV series "Dr. Pimple Popper".

Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance

The Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance – commonly abbreviated STLA or ST&amp;LA – was a revolutionary socialist labor union in the United States closely linked to the Socialist Labor Party (SLP), which existed from 1895 until becoming a part of the Industrial Workers of the World at its founding in 1905. During its existence, the STLA essentially operated as the revolutionary, "dual union" wing of the SLP.
History.
The idea to found the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance likely came from Daniel DeLeon, a leader in the Socialist Labor Party. Before 1895, DeLeon and the SLP had worked within the Knights of Labor, but then they were driven out.
The STLA was formally founded at a meeting at Cooper Union Hall on Friday, December 13, 1895. Attendees to the meeting included officials from District Assembly 49 of the Knights of Labor, which had been 'bored' into by the SLP, women distinguished in East Side (NYC) labor activities, and delegates from the recent American Federation of Labor (AFL) convention. Speakers included William Brower, John F. Tobin, J. Mahlon Barnes, Lucien Sanial, and Daniel DeLeon.
At the following convention of the SLP in 1896, it formally endorsed the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance. Hugo Vogt represented the labor union at the convention and promised that it would "not be affiliated with any capitalist party and will not support any political action except that of the Socialist Labor Party."
The organization of the STLA was very similar to that of the Knights of Labor. It differed from the American Labor Union and the IWW, which it would later become a part of, in that it was not structured industrially. It radically resented the established trade unions, like the American Federation of Labor; its Declaration of Principles asserted that "the methods and spirit of labor organization are absolutely impotent to resist the aggressions of organized capital".
The union was, however, never able to reach a mass following. Its on-paper membership total likely never eclipsed 30,000. It did not organize or control any large factories and was only able to organize one significant strike – in Slatersville, Rhode Island (now part of North Smithfield), which was, however, a great failure. In 1905, at that union's founding convention, the STLA became a part of the Industrial Workers of the World, an industrial union. Some in the IWW feared that DeLeon, who became an important leader in the organization, would attempt to make it a shadow of the SLP, as the STLA had been. In 1908, the IWW was split and DeLeon and some of his fellow STLA members left it.

Pius Schwert

Pius Louis Schwert (November 22, 1892 – March 11, 1941) was an American politician and professional baseball player. He played for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball and was a member of the United States House of Representatives from from 1939 to 1941.
A member of the Democratic Party, Schwert was elected county clerk of Erie County in 1933 and reelected in 1936. He was elected to Congress in 1938 and reelected in 1940. Schwert died following a heart attack as he was giving a speech on March 11, 1941.
Early life.
Schwert was born in Angola, New York, on November 22, 1892. He was the only child of Louisa and Julius Schwert, who was the town supervisor of Evans, New York. He attended Angola High School in Angola, until he transferred to Lafayette High School in Buffalo, New York, in 1909. He played as a catcher on the baseball teams of both high schools, and played semi-professional baseball on the weekends. Schwert graduated from Lafayette in 1910.
Schwert enrolled at the Wharton School of Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania. While enrolled at Penn, he was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon and played college baseball for the Penn Quakers as a catcher. In his senior year, his teammates voted for him to be the team captain. He had a .183 batting average in 26 games for the Quakers in 1914. Despite his poor batting average, his defensive abilities resulted in his being named to the "All-Consensus" team, a forerunner for the College Baseball All-America Team. Schwert graduated from Penn in 1914 with a Bachelor of Science in economics.
Professional baseball career.
After his graduation, Frank Chance, the manager of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball, signed Schwert to a contract. He made his major league debut on August 20. He played in three games for the Yankees in 1914, and did not have a hit in eight plate appearances. During the 1914–15 offseason, Schwert claimed that there was an error in his contract that made him a free agent. He was pursued by the Cincinnati Reds, but Bill Donovan, the Yankees' new manager, convinced him to sign a new contract with the Yankees. In 1915, Schwert was the third-string catcher behind Jeff Sweeney and Les Nunamaker. Schwert played in four games for the Yankees before they demoted him to the Jersey City Skeeters of the Class AA International League. He batted .214 in 31 games for Jersey City, was promoted to the Yankees towards the end of the season, and played in five more games for the Yankees. The game of October 7, 1915, was his last major league game. He played in 12 major league games, with a .208 batting average in 24 at-bats.
After the 1915 season, the University of the South named Schwert their new athletic director. He opened a general store in Angola in 1916. With the Yankees, Schwert competed with Nunamaker, Roxy Walters, and Walt Alexander for a roster spot for the 1916 season, but he was demoted to the Newark Indians of the International League, where he batted .232 in 84 games. Before the 1917 season, he informed teams that he was retired from baseball. The Mobile Sea Gulls of the Class A Southern Association purchased him from Newark, and Schwert refused to report to Mobile. Mobile suspended him but still reserved him for the 1918 season.
In March 1918, Schwert enlisted in the United States Navy. He served first as a yeoman at the Bremerton Navy Yard, and later he was commissioned as an ensign at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. In Philadelphia, he played for the 4th Naval District baseball team, which was managed by Harry Davis, and included Morrie Rath, Jing Johnson, and Bob Shawkey. He was discharged from the Navy at the end of the war.
Schwert returned to Angola in 1920, and played semi-professional baseball locally. When all three catchers for the Buffalo Bisons of the International League were injured during the 1920 season, Schwert signed with Buffalo, and batted .496 in 14 games. He returned to the Bisons in 1921, under the agreement that he would only play for Buffalo in home games. He batted .262 in 29 games. He was released in April 1922 when he did not report to the team. He worked at the Bank of Angola, starting as a clerk and cashier, and working his way up to serve as its president. He remained involved in semi-professional sports, becoming the president of the Western New York League in 1929.
Political career.
Schwert became involved in civic organizations in Angola. He was elected vice commander of the American Legion, president of the Angola volunteer fire department and the Southwestern Volunteer Firemen's Association, and the master of the masonic lodge in Evans. In 1933, Schwert ran for county clerk of Erie County as a Democrat. He won the election to a three-year term, won reelection in 1936, and served from 1934 to 1938.
Congress.
In 1938, Democrats needed to nominate a replacement candidate for James M. Mead in in the United States House of Representatives, after Mead was nominated to run for the United States Senate. Democratic Party members selected Schwert. He won the election, defeating Republican John Cornelius Butler. Schwert was reelected in 1940, beating Edward F. Moss. 
As a member of Congress, Schwert opposed the development of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and supported the development of harbors for boats in the Southtowns and welfare programs and vocational training for youth. He supported providing aid to France and Great Britain during World War II. Schwert also wrote to Governor Herbert H. Lehman to advocate for the completion of McKinley Parkway.
Death.
Schwert died in Washington, D.C., on March 11, 1941. He attended a dinner party at the Annapolis Hotel and collapsed shortly after making a speech. In the speech, he was announcing his candidacy for mayor of Buffalo. He was rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead of a heart attack. He was buried at Forest Avenue Cemetery in Angola. Schwert had survived a previous heart attack in 1940 that occurred when he was exercising in the United States Capitol gymnasium.
Personal life and death.
Schwert married Harriet "Hattie" Elizabeth Schwert, a distant cousin, on February 12, 1923. She was a teacher in Buffalo and Eden, New York. They did not have children.
Harriet Schwert ran against Butler in the special election to fill the remainder of Schwert's term in Congress. As she was still in mourning, Harriet did not campaign, with Mead making speeches on her behalf. Butler defeated Schwert in the election.

Blockley Almshouse

The Blockley Almshouse, later known as Philadelphia General Hospital, was a charity hospital and poorhouse located in West Philadelphia. It originally opened in 1732/33 in a different part of the city as the Philadelphia Almshouse (not to be confused with the Friends' Almshouse, established 1713). Philadelphia General Hospital closed in 1977.
History.
Origins.
The Blockley Almshouse had its roots in the Philadelphia Almshouse, a facility first located in the block between Third, fifth, Spruce and Pine Streets. Constructed in 1731–32, this institution provided the first government-sponsored care of the poor in America, as it offered an infirmary and hospital for the sick and insane, besides housing and feeding the impoverished.
In 1767, it moved to larger quarters occupying the block between Tenth, Eleventh, Spruce and Pine Streets. This site was officially called the Philadelphia Bettering House.
Old Blockley.
In 1835, the overcrowded Philadelphia Almshouse moved to Blockley Township in West Philadelphia, an area once known as "Blockley Farm" now between 34th Street and University Avenue. Built to house a variety of Philadelphia's indigent population, the facility consisted of a quadrangle of four sizable buildings including a poorhouse, a hospital, an orphanage, and an insane asylum. Construction of the first building had begun in 1830, with its cornerstone laid on May 26. William Strickland was the architect and Samuel Sloan, later to be a well-known architect, worked as journeyman carpenter on the project.
The institution was later renamed the Philadelphia Almshouse and Hospital, but it was commonly called "Old Blockley" for decades after. Operated by a city committee known as the "Guardians of the Poor", Blockley's early reputation for care was dismal. In 1864, the "Female Lunatic Asylum" building was accidentally destroyed by workers installing heaters, killing 18 women and injuring another 20. Blockley's geographical isolation from city medical institutions limited clinical care until the University of Pennsylvania, with its medical school, moved to a site just north of the Almshouse grounds in 1871.
As the latter 19th century saw advancements in both medicine and psychiatry, Blockley's mission gradually embraced that of a more conventional public hospital. A nursing school was opened at the site in 1885 under the direction of Alice Fisher, replacing ad hoc patient nurses with a system of skilled nursing. In 1903, operations of the hospital were turned over to the newly created Bureau of Hospitals in the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. In 1906, the insane were moved to the Byberry Mental Hospital, later known as the Philadelphia State Hospital.
Philadelphia General Hospital.
"Old Blockley" was renamed Philadelphia General Hospital (PGH) in 1919. In the next few decades, the original almshouse buildings were gradually replaced with modern facilities. By the 1950s the site contained the city's public hospital, as well as a nursing home and a home for the indigent.
In 1952, the new City Home Rule Charter placed the control of Philadelphia General Hospital with a board of trustees. Under contracts signed in 1959, care at PGH was carried out by the medical schools of Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania, who subcontracted work to Jefferson Medical College, Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, and Hahnemann Medical School.
By the early 1970s, public support including Medicaid allowed private hospitals to expand treatment for the poor. Facing both financial difficulties as well as a stock of aging buildings, the board of PGH closed the hospital entirely in 1977.
Location.
The Almshouse was built by the city in what was then known as Blockley Township, on land purchased from the Andrew Hamilton estate. This parcel of land stretched from what are now known as Civic Center Boulevard to Guardian Drive and from University Avenue to 34th Street. A blue historical marker was erected on Curie Boulevard commemorating the significance of the site.
Today the site is occupied by parts of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Health System, and the Veterans Health Administration and represents a major center of medical research and care in Philadelphia. The Penn Museum also stands on former Almshouse grounds. A long brick wall topped by an ornately decorated iron fence that dates back to PGH still forms part of the southern and western boundaries of the site.
In 2001, more than 1,000 bodies associated with the Almshouse were recovered from an adjacent construction site and reburied in nearby Woodlands Cemetery.

Angeli–Rimini reaction

The Angeli–Rimini reaction is an organic reaction between an aldehyde and N-hydroxybenzenesulfonamide in presence of base forming a hydroxamic acid.
The other reaction product is a sulfinic acid. The reaction was discovered by the two Italian chemists Angelo Angeli and Enrico Rimini (1874–1917), and was published in 1896.
Chemical test.
The reaction is used in a chemical test for the detection of aldehydes in combination with ferric chloride. In this test a few drops of aldehyde containing specimen is dissolved in ethanol, the sulfonamide is added together with some sodium hydroxide solution and then the solution is acidified to Congo red. An added drop of ferric chloride will turn the solution an intense red when aldehyde is present. The sulfonamide can be prepared by reaction of hydroxylamine and benzenesulfonyl chloride in ethanol with potassium metal.
Reaction mechanism.
The reaction mechanism for this reaction is not clear and several potential pathways exist. The N-hydroxybenzenesulfonamide 1 or its deprotonated form 2 is a nucleophile in reaction with the aldehyde 3 to intermediate 4. After intramolecular proton exchange to 5 a sulfinic acid anion is split off and hydroxamic acid 8 results through nitroso compound 6 and intermediate 7. Alternatively aziridine intermediate 9 directly forms the end=product. The formation of the nitrene intermediate 10 is ruled out given the lack of reactivity of the chemical mixture towards simple alkenes.
Scope.
The Angeli–Rimini reaction has recently been applied in solid-phase synthesis with the sulfonamide covalently linked to a polystyrene solid support.

Endeavor Talent Agency

The Endeavor Talent Agency was a Beverly Hills–based talent agency founded by Ari Emanuel, Rick Rosen, Tom Strickler, and David Greenblatt. It was launched in March 1995 and went on to represent a wide variety of acclaimed film and television stars. In April 2009, Emanuel and Endeavor executive Patrick Whitesell orchestrated a merger with the William Morris Agency, resulting in William Morris Endeavor. William Morris Endeavor was renamed Endeavor in October 2017.
History.
Formation.
The roots of Endeavor can be traced to ICM Partners, where founders Emanuel, Rosen, Strickler, and Greenblatt were all top television agents. In early 1995, they formed a plan to start their own agency, which was ultimately discovered by ICM Chairman Jeff Berg.
On March 29, the four agents were fired from ICM and immediately formed Endeavor. The agency began operations on March 30, working mainly with television clients from an office above the former Islands Restaurant in South Beverly Hills. Co-founder Ari Emanuel and the Endeavor Agency were the basis for the character Ari Gold, and his Miller Gold Agency, on HBO's "Entourage".
1996–2003: Expansion / Whitesell joins.
In 1996, Endeavor moved to a new high-rise building at 9601 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills. Three new partners from CAA quickly joined the company: David Lonner, Doug Robinson, and Adam Venit. Lonner's clientele included the feature directors that Endeavor needed to solidify its standing as a full service agency. Robinson and Venit were the first actors' agents and had a client list that included Hank Azaria, Adam Sandler, and David Spade (all of whom are now represented by WME).
The Endeavor talent department grew dramatically during the next eight years, mainly with the 2001 addition of former CAA talent head, Patrick Whitesell. Whitesell led the development of the agency's list of feature film headliners, with a talent pool that included Ben Affleck, Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Hugh Jackman, and Jude Law. The group also signed several comedy stars during that period, including Sacha Baron Cohen, Kevin James, and Charlie Sheen.
2003–2009: Continued growth.
By 2003, Endeavor had become one of the industry's fastest-growing talent agencies. In June of that year, they relocated to 9601 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, which is now the current headquarters of WME. The Wilshire office was designed by UCLA professor and architect Neil Denari with wall graphics by 2x4 of New York City. For this project, "NMDA Inc.", the company of Neil Denari, and associate architect "Interior Architects" received the "2007 Institute Honor Award for Interior Architecture" from the American Institute of Architects (AIA).
In 2006, agent Nancy Josephson left ICM after the company went through an ownership change. Endeavor quickly brought in Josephson and her clients "Friends" creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane, Craig Ferguson, Tyra Banks, and director David Frankel. Soon after, ICM agents Matt Solo and Robert Newman joined as well. Solo's roster included "The Shield" creator Shawn Ryan, while Newman's brought esteemed film directors Guillermo del Toro, Baz Luhrmann, Danny Boyle and Robert Rodriguez.
2008 brought four key additions from UTA, including talent agents Sharon Jackson and Nick Stevens. Their clients, Will Arnett, Jack Black, Jonah Hill, Amy Poehler, and Ben Stiller, bolstered the agency's comedy department.
2009–present.
In 2008, Emanuel and Whitesell began preliminary discussions with the William Morris Agency about a company merger. By April 2009, the announcement was made and William Morris Endeavor was formed. WMA ultimately relocated to Endeavor's Beverly Hills office and Emanuel and Whitesell retained the titles of Co-CEOs. Their successful partnership ultimately led "Fortune" to name Emanuel and Whitesell on their 2010 "Businessperson of the Year" list.
Following the disappearance of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi on 2 October 2018, and reports that a Saudi hit squad had assassinated him, Endeavor vowed to sever its ties with Saudi Arabia. Emanuel reportedly called White House senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner to relay his frustration and discuss withdrawing the agency from a $400 million financial deal with the regime in Saudi Arabia.

Short-tailed pygmy tyrant

The short-tailed pygmy tyrant (Myiornis ecaudatus) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae, the tyrant flycatchers. It is found on Trinidad and in every mainland South American country except Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay.
Taxonomy and systematics.
The short-tailed pygmy tyrant was originally described in 1837 as "Todirostrum ecaudatum". In the early to mid-twentieth century it was placed in genus "Perissotriccus" which was later merged into "Myiornis". Several authors have suggested that genus "Myiornis" should be merged into genus "Hemitriccus".
The short-tailed pygmy tyrant has two subspecies, the nominate "M. e. ecaudatus" (D'Orbigny &amp; Lafresnaye, 1837) and "M. e. miserabilis" (Chubb, C, 1919). Between about 1940 and 1970 some authors included what is now the black-capped pygmy tyrant ("M. atricapillus") as a third subspecies. The short-tailed and black-capped pygmy tyrants apparently form a superspecies.
Description.
The short-tailed pygmy tyrant is long and weighs about . It is the smallest passerine on Earth. The sexes have the same plumage. Adults of the nominate subspecies have a mostly dark gray head with blackish lores, a prominent white spot above the lores, and a white eye-ring; the last two give a spectacled appearance. Their back, rump, and uppertail coverts are bright olive green. Their wings are dusky with bright olive edges on the flight feathers and tips on the coverts; the latter show as two faint wing bars. They have an extremely short, mostly black, tail. Their throat and underparts are white with a pale yellow tinge on the crissum. They have a brown to dark iris, a black bill that is unusually long for a bird its size, and pinkish legs and feet. Subspecies "M. e. miserabilis" has a darker and duller green back than the nominate, with a darker gray crown and nape, grayer or pale olivaceous sides on the breast, and darker legs. Juveniles of both subspecies resemble their respective adults. The short-tailed pygmy tyrant resembles the larger slate-headed tody-flycatcher ("Poecilotriccus sylvia") but "is much more likely to be mistaken for a large beetle or insect, [especially] in flight, than another bird".
Distribution and habitat.
The short-tailed pygmy tyrant is primarily a bird of the Amazon Basin though it is found outside that area. The nominate subspecies is found on Trinidad and from the southeastern third of Colombia east through the southern half of Venezuela, the Guianas, and northern Brazil north of the Amazon and east of the upper Negro River. It is found also in the Andes of northwestern Venezuela and coastally in Carabobo and Sucre states. (The map in McMullan's "Field Guide to the Birds of Colombia" shows a much more extensive range in that country than do other maps.) Subspecies "M. e. miserabilis" is found in eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, northern and eastern Bolivia, and Brazil south of the Amazon. The species inhabits the interior, edges, and gaps in humid forest and also nearby secondary and transitional forest in the lowlands and Andean foothills. In elevation it occurs below in Colombia, below in Ecuador, below in Peru, and below in Brazil. In Venezuela it occurs below north of the Orinoco River and below south of it.
Behavior.
Movement.
The short-tailed pygmy tyrant is a year-round resident.
Feeding.
The short-tailed pygmy tyrant feeds on insects. It typically forages singly or in pairs and very rarely joins mixed-species feeding flocks. It mostly forages in the forest canopy though lower at the edges and in gaps. It takes prey mostly by using short upward sallies from a perch to grab it from leaves, and also sometimes gleans it while briefly hovering after a short flight.
Breeding.
The short-tailed pygmy tyrant's breeding season varies geographically; it includes February to May in Colombia, June to September in Brazil, and August to October in Peru. There are single breeding records from each of Venezuela and Suriname in January. The species' nest is a domed bag with a side entrance under a small "awning". It is made from a variety of materials including moss, grass, dry leaves, and rootlets lined with hair or soft plant fibers and down. It often has a "beard" of loose material hanging from its underside. It typically hangs from a branch between above the ground. The clutch is two eggs that are white with brownish to cinnamon spots. The female alone is believed to incubate the clutch but both parents provision nestlings. The incubation period and time to fledging are not known.
Vocalization.
Sources compare the short-tailed pygmy tyrant's vocalizations to sounds made by insects and frogs. The most common is "a soft trilled, purr-like call, sometimes leading into long series of short, squeaky “creek” notes beginning slowly and accelerating, 'cre’e’e’e’e’, k’e’e’e’e' ". Another rendition is "teeeee-tuuuuur". Its calls include "high, rising "treet" or "peet?" notes" than can be doubled or in a series. Another author describes these as a "'crreek' or 'tstrreep' ".
Status.
The IUCN has assessed the short-tailed pygmy tyrant as being of Least Concern. It has an extremely large range; its population size is not known and is believed to be decreasing. No immediate threats have been identified. It is considered fairly common in Colombia, "local (just overlooked?)" in Ecuador, "uncommon but widespread" in Peru, and "fairly common but easily overlooked" in Venezuela. It "[o]ccurs in many national parks and other protected areas throughout its range".

<doc id="6950877" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6950877" title="Mercer Rubber Company">
Mercer Rubber Company

Mercer Rubber Company is a manufacturer of rubber products. 
History.
The company was founded in 1865 by the Frederick Sayen family. Mercer Rubber Company operated from a site at 136 Mercer Street in Hamilton Square, an area within Hamilton Township, New Jersey, from 1866 until 1993. The company was purchased from the Sayen family by someone identified in New Jersey government reports only as "Mr. Brennan" in 1977, and from "Mr. Brennan" by Mason Industries in 1983. In January 1993, company operations were relocated to Hauppauge, Suffolk County, New York.
The company manufactured natural rubber products at the Hamilton Square location from 1866 until the 1930s, and synthetic rubber products from the 1930s until the location was closed in 1993. According to the company's web site, Mercer Rubber "started manufacturing mason jar gaskets and other small molded products in 1866" and "moved on to conveyor belting, customized industrial hose, and ultimately, expansion joints" around the beginning of the 20th century.
Pollution.
Significant controversy exists regarding Mercer Rubber Company's former Hamilton Square, New Jersey location and Frederick Sayen's former home at 155 Hughes Drive, directly across Mercer Street from the now demolished Rubber Company site.
The Sayen home and its gardens were purchased by Hamilton Township from developer David Cellars in 1988 with the intention of turning the Sayen property into a public park called Sayen Park Botanical Garden.
According to an article in the September 1, 2006 Times of Trenton, an unknown source contacted the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1991, three days prior to the public opening of Sayen Garden. The source claimed that, "waste chemicals and solid debris "(from Mercer Rubber)" had been dumped on the Sayen Gardens grounds for years while the property was the home of Frederick Sayen." The "Times" article states that, although "investigators found evidence that debris had been dumped on the grounds, they did nothing to further verify the complaint." The park opened as scheduled in 1991.
Former employees have substantiated the unknown source's claim, adding that a "pipe underneath the plant carried waste to a stream that ran through the Sayen Gardens property and eventually to Miry Run Brook."
The buildings on the Mercer Rubber Company site were demolished to make way for 11 single-family homes. At that time, soil and sediment samples were taken, and the following chemicals were found to be present:
The site was subsequently cleaned up in 1996. The NJ Department of Health report also notes that, during the time the plant was in operation, "volatile chemicals were emitted to the air." However the extent of the environmental damage is not known, as "air permit and production records are not available."
In 2000, new dumping charges caused the NJ Department of Environmental Protection to send a letter to Mercer Rubber Company at their Hauppauge, New York location demanding information about waste dumping and the runoff pipe. The DEP also claimed they'd never been previously informed of any dumping allegations in spite of the unknown source's allegations being a matter of record. Norman Mason, owner of Mason Industries, reportedly responded to this letter "saying he knew nothing of dumping on the grounds and did not plan to investigate as the DEP had asked." The matter was then dropped by the NJ DEP. 
The matter was put into the spotlight again in late-summer 2006, when residents requested an investigation of what they perceived to be elevated instances of cancer in the immediate area of the former Mercer Rubber Company plant. The report acknowledged that certain types of cancer were more prominent than normal in the area. However, investigators could find no causal relationship between the elevated instances of certain types of cancer and the Mercer Rubber Company plant.
Five individuals, four of them former Mercer Rubber employees, were interviewed in preparation of the report. One interviewee stated that "many drums of liquid" (identified as oil, organic solvents and water) were dumped north of the Sayen House between 1969 and 1971. Another reported that the location's hydraulic presses leaked "large amounts of lubricating oil," which eventually made its way into a "creek across Mercer Street" via a floor drain. Another interviewee corroborated this account, but stated the practice stopped in 1969, when the company began collecting the oil in drums and dumping it directly "onto the ground from the Sayen House." Two individuals identified a large drain which carried waste liquids under Mercer Street and into an unnamed creek. Two former employees reported that, prior to 1953, "bulk rubber was burned in the back of the factory." Two others reported that solid waste was dumped "at a location approximately to the north of the Sayen House and in the ice skating pond near the Township Athletic Baseball field." 
At a September 13, 2006, meeting with local residents held at the Nottingham Firehouse, just yards from the old Mercer Rubber site, state officials admitted to residents that the findings reported in the Public Health Assessment are incomplete.

Stacy Horn

Stacy Horn (born June 3, 1956 in Norfolk, Virginia) is an American author, businesswoman and occasional journalist.
She grew up on Long Island, New York and received a B.F.A. from Tufts University and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. She received a graduate degree from New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program.
In 1990, after working as a telecommunications analyst for Mobil Corporation, Horn founded Echo, a New York-based bulletin board system.
EchoNYC.
Stacy Horn founded EchoNYC or Echo, a New York City Internet salon, in 1990, whose members are called Echoids and go by their real names rather than a UserName. The WELL, one of the oldest virtual communities in continuous operation, was an influence. Horn later decided that Echo stood for "East Coast Hang Out".
Horn saw the Echo bulletin board system as a place where conversation could revolve around literature, film, culture, and sex, rather than the more pervasive topics of computer technology at the time. Originally run out of Horn's apartment in Greenwich Village in her spare time, Echo rapidly expanded its membership, and eventually consumed every free phone line in her Greenwich Village neighborhood, requiring New York Telephone to run a separate cable to Horn's apartment. In 1990, Echo became a company with a core group of members chosen by Horn for their "strong on-line personalities", who were responsible for creating enticing discussions to attract users. She donated twenty years worth of Echo's archives to the New York Historical Society.
Books.
Her first book, "Cyberville: Clicks, Culture and the Creation of an Online Town" (Warner Books, 1998), describes the community that formed on Echo, the problems Horn encountered as Echo's final authority, and her observations about the nature of the virtual world. Through the 90s, she was often profiled and quoted in articles about life and business on the internet. Her book is still used in courses on the sociology of virtual communities.
The publication of her second book, "Waiting For My Cats to Die: A Morbid Memoir" (St. Martin's Press, 2001), a memoir about her midlife crisis, revealing an unusual fascination with death, coincided with a series of commentaries for the NPR's All Things Considered on the same subject.
Her third book, "The Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad" (Viking, 2005), recounts the stories of four of New York's cold cases and profiles the detectives who investigate them.
Her fourth book, "Unbelievable: Investigations into Ghosts, Poltergeists, Telepathy, and Other Unseen Phenomena, from the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory", was published in 2009.
Her fifth book is about singing. It is titled "Imperfect Harmony: Finding Happiness Singing With Others", and it was published by Algonquin Books in 2013.
Her sixth book, titled "Damnation Island: Poor, Sick, Mad, and Criminal in 19th-Century New York", is about Blackwell's Island and was also published by Algonquin Books in May, 2018.
Her seventh book, "The Killing Fields of East New York: The First Subprime Mortgage Scandal, a White-Collar Crime Spree, and the Collapse of an American Neighborhood", uses the history of East New York, Brooklyn, to explore the connection between white collar crime and the destruction of neighborhoods of color across America. It was published by Gillian Flynn Books and Zando Projects in January, 2025.

National Board of Chiropractic Examiners

The National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE) is a non-profit national and international testing organization for the chiropractic profession that develops, administers, analyzes, scores, and reports results from various examinations. Examinations are offered to students at chiropractic colleges accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE). The NBCE maintains its headquarters in Greeley, Colorado. The organization was established in 1963 to standardize chiropractic testing requirements as opposed to each state having its own board exam. Since 1963, all but one of states have adopted the passage of Parts I-IV; however, each state has its own licensing requirements in addition to the NBCE exams.
History.
Chiropractic made two unsuccessful attempts to create a national board of chiropractic in the early to mid 1900s, and by 1962 Joseph Janse proposed another attempt at creating an agency comparable to those being established by organized medicine, dentistry, and osteopathy. An organizational meeting was held in Detroit, Michigan on July 26, 1962 which was supported by both the International Chiropractors Association and the National Chiropractic Association, and by June 19, 1963 the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners was officially incorporated.
At first, the establishment of this board was met with resistance from individual state-run licensing boards as this was seen as an attempt to override the states' individual authority. However, by 1970 with the help of the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards, a majority of the states recognized the NCBE.
Examinations.
The National Board of Chiropractic Examiners provides written and practical examinations that are administered twice yearly at chiropractic colleges in the United States, Canada, France, United Kingdom, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand. The NBCE does not promote a particular philosophy but formulates test plans according to information provided collectively by surveying course content of chiropractic colleges. Input is also provided by state regulatory agencies, field practitioners, and subject specialists. Through a survey called the "Practice Analysis of Chiropractic," information gathered about the day-to-day practice patterns of practitioners also serves as a basis for the Part III and Part IV exams.
The NBCE also administers tests in two electives: physiotherapy (PT) and acupuncture. The physiotherapy examination can be taken upon completion of 120 hours of PT course work through a chiropractic college program. The acupuncture examination is now computerized and can be taken upon completion of 100 hours of acupuncture course work through a chiropractic college or other accredited program. The acupuncture examination is only offered six times a year, since being computerized.
Passing scores.
The minimal passing score for all NBCE exams is 375/800. For parts I and II a passing score of 4 out of 6 sectional tests to ensure the applicant has passed the examination as a whole. However, to be licensed full an applicant will need to pass all 6 sections before they are able to practice.
Post-licensure examinations.
The NBCE administers two tests for post-licensure purposes. 
Board of directors.
There are 11 board members. Five directors are elected from each of five U.S. geographic regions. These district directors serve a term of three years. Four directors are elected by the board to serve two-year, at-large terms. Two directors are appointed by the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards. The board elects an executive committee of officers to fill the positions of president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary.

Mary Anderson (actress, born 1859)

Mary Anderson (later Mary Anderson de Navarro; July 28, 1859 – May 29, 1940) was an American theatre actress.
Early life.
Anderson was born in Sacramento, California. Shortly after her birth, her parents moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where her father enlisted in the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War. He was killed in action at Mobile when she was three.
Anderson was educated at the Ursuline convent and the all-girl Presentation Academy in Louisville. She was an unenthusiastic pupil except for her interest in reading and acting Shakespeare. She also took private lessons in music, dancing and literature. Encouraged by her stepfather, Dr Hamilton Griffin, at 14 she was sent to New York for ten lessons with the actor George Vandenhoff, her only professional training.
Stage career.
In 1875, she made her first stage appearance at a benefit performance at Macauley's Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky, in the role of Shakespeare's Juliet The manager, Barney Macauley, was sufficiently impressed to extend the booking to a week as Juliet and further roles including Julia in Sheridan Knowles's "The Hunchback", Bianca in Henry Hart Milman's "Fazio", and R. L. Sheil's "Evadne".
Further engagements at St Louis, New Orleans and John McCullough's theatre in San Francisco led to a contract with John T. Ford. Starting as Lady Macbeth in his Washington theatre in 1877, she began an extensive US tour, culminating with a six-week engagement in Edward Bulwer Lytton's "The Lady of Lyons" at the 5th Avenue Theatre, New York. Critical review was mixed, but she was immediately popular with the public as "Our Mary."
In 1883, after starring in an American production of W. S. Gilbert's "Pygmalion and Galatea", she went on the London stage at the Lyceum Theatre, remaining in England for six years to perform to much acclaim including at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-on-Avon. Her first season there, she starred in Gilbert's "Comedy and Tragedy" as well as in "Romeo and Juliet" in 1884.
In 1887 in London she appeared in "The Winter's Tale" in the double role of Perdita and Hermione (the first actress to include this innovation). This production ran to 160 performances, and was taken back to the United States. She invited writer William Black to appear in the production, but, even in a non-speaking role, he froze up and interrupted the performance. In 1889, however, she collapsed on stage due to severe nervous exhaustion during a performance at Albaugh's Theatre in Washington. Disbanding her company, she announced her retirement at the age of 30. Some commentators, particularly in the British press, ascribed this turn of events to hostile press reviews on her return to the U.S. The author Willa Cather went further and blamed a specifically hurtful review from a close friend.
For part of her career, Napier Lothian Jr. served as Anderson's talent manager.
Later life.
Ordered to rest after her breakdown, Mary Anderson visited England. In 1890 she married Antonio Fernando de Navarro. She became known as Mary Anderson de Navarro. They settled at Court Farm in the Cotswolds, Broadway, Worcestershire, where she cultivated an interest in music and became a noted hostess with a distinguished circle of musical, literary and ecclesiastical guests. She also gave birth to three children, one son who died at birth, another son, Alma Jose "Toty" Maria de Navarro and a daughter, Mary Elena de Navarro.
A devout Roman Catholic, she had a chapel built in her attic, with stained-glass windows designed by Paul Woodroffe. She has been cited as a model for characters in the Mapp and Lucia novels of E. F. Benson, either the operatic soprano Olga Bracely or Lucia herself, as well as the prototype for the heroine of William Black's novel "The Strange Adventures of a House-Boat".
She resisted encouragements to return to the theatre, but did a number of fund-raising performances during World War I in Worcester, Stratford and London. The latter included roles as Galatea, Juliet and Clarice in W. S. Gilbert's play "Comedy and Tragedy". She published two books of her memories, the 1896 "A Few Memories" and the 1936 "A Few More Memories", and collaborated with Robert Smythe Hichens on a 1911 New York stage adaptation of his novel, "The Garden of Allah".
Death.
She died at her home in Broadway, Worcestershire, in 1940, aged 80. She was survived by her son and daughter.
Legacy.
The Mary Anderson Theatre was the oldest theatre on Louisville's 4th Street. It opened in 1907 as a vaudeville house, but two years later began to screen movies. The theatre closed in 1972 and was converted into office space.
Land donated by Anderson in Mount St. Francis, Indiana to the Conventual Franciscan Friars is now the Mount Saint Francis Center for Spirituality. The center serves as the headquarters for the Province of Our Lady of Consolation and home to the Mary Anderson Center, an artist colony. In 1989, the portion of US Route 150 that adjoins the donated property was named the Mary Anderson Memorial Highway.
The house and farm that Mary and Antonio Navarro purchased and extended in the town of Broadway, "Court Farm", is recognised as hosting one of the best preserved Edwardian gardens. It was left to her son, Toty de Navarro, who lived there with his wife, Dorothy, their son Michael and Dorothy's long-time Cambridge friend, Gertrude Caton Thompson. As in the years when Mary lived there, it was often filled with visiting artists and musicians, including Myra Hess and a young Jacqueline du Pré.

Orselina

Orselina is a municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
History.
Orselina is first mentioned in 1182 as "Concilio Meziano". In 1323 it was mentioned as "Orsarina". During the Middle Ages and into the Early Modern Period, it (along with Burbaglio and Muralto) was part of the "Vicinanza" of Consiglio Mezzano, which belonged to the Locarno and Ascona region. The castle SS Abbondio e Biagio was given in the 12th century as a fief by the Bishop of Como to the Muralto family. The castle was destroyed in the 14th century. The political municipality of Orselina was formed in 1803 and included Muralto. Up until 1850, Orselina dominated the municipality, thanks to the economic weight of its livestock and vineyards. However, even by the 19th century, the two towns had developed differently. While in the upper part (Orselina) the traditional socio-economic structure remained, the lower part along the lake (Muralto) grew industrially and urbanized. The differences in the towns led to a division of the municipality in 1881 into Orselina and Muralto.
The 16th-century Church of S. Bernardo was initially dependent on the Church of S. Vittore in Muralto. Starting in 1816, the church's pastor came from Locarno. It became the center of its own parish in 1966.
During 1930-80, the number of German residents surpassed that of the Italian-speaking. But by 2000, the ratio was the reversed (380 to 460). From the beginning of the 20th century, Orselina developed into a holiday and tourist destination.

Where Does My Heart Beat Now

"Where Does My Heart Beat Now" is a song performed by Canadian recording artist Celine Dion for her ninth studio album and debut English-language album, "Unison" (1990). It was released by Columbia Records as the third single from "Unison" in Canada on 1 October 1990. It was also issued as the lead single in the United States in late 1990, and in other parts of the world in early 1991. "Where Does My Heart Beat Now" was written by Robert White Johnson and Taylor Rhodes in 1988, and recorded by Dion one year later. The song was produced by Christopher Neil. Dion premiered the song at the Eurovision Song Contest 1989 in Switzerland, where she performed it along with her 1988 winning song, "Ne partez pas sans moi".
"Where Does My Heart Beat Now" received positive reviews from music critics, and won the ASCAP Pop Award. It was the most successful single from "Unison", and became Dion's highest charting English-language single at the time. It reached number four on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, and Dion became the first French-Canadian artist to land a top-ten hit there. It did even better on the Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at number two. "Where Does My Heart Beat Now" reached also the top-ten in Norway and Canada, peaking at number four and six, respectively. Two accompanying music videos for the song were filmed. In 2008, it was included on the North American edition of Dion's greatest hits compilation "".
Background and release.
In 1989, Dion was recording her first English-language album, "Unison". One of the songs chosen for the album was "Where Does My Heart Beat Now", written by Robert White Johnson and Taylor Rhodes.

The song was then released as the third single from the album in Canada on 1 October 1990. It was also issued as the lead single from "Unison" in the United States in late 1990, and in early 1991 in the rest of the world.

In Canada, "Where Does My Heart Beat Now" entered the charts in October 1990 and reached number six on "The Record" Retail Singles Chart on 8 April 1991. It also topped the "RPM" Adult Contemporary chart for two weeks in February 1991. In the United States, "Where Does My Heart Beat Now" debuted at number 80 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart dated 8 December 1990.

Critical reception.
American magazine "Billboard" complimented the song as a "lushly framed single". "Chicago Tribune" editor Jan De Knock felt that Dion "shines brightest on torchy love songs", including "Where Does My Heart Beat Now". A reviewer from "Columbia Daily Tribune" declared it as a "swelling ballad". Dave Sholin from the "Gavin Report" commented, "Climbing the Adult Contemporary chart, this French-Canadian only learned to speak English three years ago—a surprising fact in light of the way she handles this stirring ballad". Chris Roberts from "Melody Maker" wrote, "Whitney/Mariah epic slush/lust ballad of the week. By Christ these millionairesses know how to give a chorus some welly. Utterly f*** fantastic, makes me roll around in satin sheets like a proper girlie." Pan-European magazine "Music &amp; Media" praised it as a "slow-stepping emotional song, with an effective and dramatic build-up, brought to life by one of Canada's hottest singers of the moment." A reviewer for "Music Week" called it "a tense ballad which finds her deep in Gloria Estefan territory." Gene Sandbloom from "The Network Forty" said, "Truly an epic production, this huge ballad has everything but cannon fire and missile explosions. With the deep and sincere vocals of French-Canadian Celine Dion". "Newcastle Evening Chronicle" remarked its "slow measured tempo on a sensually dramatic ballad." "The Orlando Sentinel" viewed it as a "splashy pop-gospel ballad". 
Retrospective response.
About.com ranked "Where Does My Heart Beat Now" number five in their list of "Top 10 Celine Dion Songs" in 2017. In a 2020 retrospective review, Matthew Hocter from Albumism named it the standout track of the "Unison" album and "the one that truly brought Dion to the masses". AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine picked it as an album standout along with "(If There Was) Any Other Way". Talk About Pop Music's Christopher Smith described the song as a "power ballad", which showcases Dion's "vocal power".
Music video.
Three versions of the music video exist: a black and white Canadian version for the Canadian market (released in October 1990), a color performance version for the US promotion (November 1990) directed by David Phillips, and a black-and-white version mixed with the performance version made for the "Unison" home video (July 1991).

Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards

The Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards, based in Greeley, Colorado, is a non-profit organization which facilitates the coordination and communication of the 50 individual United States' chiropractic licensing boards.
History.
The earliest ancestor of the FCLB was chartered in Memphis in September 1926 as the International Congress of Chiropractic Examining Boards. From this organization, Congress created the Council of State Chiropractic Examining Boards (CSCEB) in 1933. This board was originally associated with the National Chiropractic Association, but by 1947 decided to withdraw itself from the influence of any national association and formed its own independently run organization. Incorporating itself in Wyoming it received federal tax-exempt status in 1968.
By 1974 the name of the organization was changed to its present-day name, the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards. The newly formed FCLB first sought to arbitrate the merger of the Association of Chiropractic Colleges with the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE) as both were attempting to earn national accreditation from the United States Office of Education. As arbitration drew near the CCE secured accreditation from the U.S. government, and quickly thereafter the FCLB supported its claim on the government petition.
Mission.
The mission of the FCLB is to maintain high, uniform standards in areas related to chiropractic licensure, regulation, discipline, and education. The organization provides services to member chiropractic licensing boards to fulfill their statutory obligations and regulate the profession within the interest of public protection.
Affiliations.
The Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards collaborates closely with the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE) and Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE) because of their shared mission of public protection. The FCLB also works closely with the NBCE and to develop uniform standards of education and examination for its national board exams parts 1-4.
A database of providers called CIN-BAD (Chiropractic Information Network - Board Action Database) provides member boards and other subscribers access to information regarding licensed chiropractors in the US, Canada, and Australia. CIN-BAD's ever-expanding databases are increasingly significant resources for regulatory boards, chiropractic colleges, managed care providers, law enforcement agencies, and the public.
A service called PACE (Providers of Approved Chiropractic Education) assists the member regulatory boards in validating quality educational courses for licensed chiropractors as well as tracking obtained continuing education credit hours for compliance purposes.
The FCLB also manages a program for Certified Chiropractic Clinical Assistants, which is a certification program for competent office assistants who may legally provide certain limited clinical services in a chiropractic setting. The program establishes minimal testing, training and character standards for chiropractic assistants to best protect the public.
Membership.
Members include boards having jurisdiction to license or regulate the practice of chiropractic in the states, provinces, commonwealths, and territories of the United States of America, Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, New Zealand and other jurisdictions.
Current regulatory board members, as well as those who have served on a board within the last five years, may participate as Fellows in FCLB activities, including holding office or serving on standing committees. Those who have ever served on a chiropractic regulatory board are Honorary Fellows, privileged to attend the annual business meeting.

List of recurring characters in The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody

The following is a list of recurring and minor characters in the Disney Channel Original Series The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody. These characters were regularly rotated, often disappearing for long periods during the series.
Tipton staff.
Arwin Hochhauser.
Arwin Quentin Hochhauser (played by Brian Stepanek) is a wacky Greek-American inventor who works as a stationary engineer for the Tipton. He is friends with Zack, Cody, and Maddie in the series. As shown in many episodes, he has a massive crush on Carey but is too afraid to act upon it. He hates carrots and is allergic to horses, as shown in "Free Tippy". Every time Carey kisses him, he faints, as seen in "Kisses &amp; Basketball", "Bowling", and "Going for the Gold". His affection is also shown in his office which has a picture of Carey, as well as a cardboard cutout of her, which he claims to his cousin is his wife. Arwin was a professional bowler, as illustrated in "Bowling", but quit when he lost his ball on the backswing and hit his mother in the head, shrinking her by a foot during a championship match. He is also known for being obsessed with his mother; he lived with her his whole life until she got married and moved out. Arwin is considered childlike by many characters in the show; he enjoys picture books, sleeps with a sock monkey, and eats a lunch packed by his mother. However, Arwin is much loved by Zack and Cody. A spin-off television series was planned about him, where he goes to live with his sister to help her take care of her children. The series name ideas consisted of "Arwin" and "Housebroken", though it was never picked up.
Arwin makes a guest appearance in "The Suite Life on Deck" via web chat on Cody's laptop in the episode "It's All Greek To Me". Also, in the episode, it's revealed that he has a cousin named Milos in Greece (also played by Stepanek). In the episode "Computer Date", Arwin boards the ship and creates a supercomputer dubbed "Cal" (until he found out it was female, renaming her "Callie") to make the SS "Tipton" run more efficiently. However, it all goes downhill when Callie develops romantic feelings for Cody, causing her to go haywire and start to remove everyone else, and Arwin is forced to shut her down. At the end of the episode, Arwin attempts to get off the ship by using a giant magnet, but it fails, and he falls into the ocean. In "A London Carol", Mr. Moseby mentions Arwin when London Tipton gets stuck in the past. Arwin makes his final appearance in "Graduation on Deck", finally meeting the twins' real father Kurt, and briefly claiming that he is their stepfather.
Esteban Ramírez.
 Julio Ricardo Montoya de la Rosa Ramírez (played by Adrian R'Mante) is the head bellman at the Tipton. His signature quotes are "This is a disaster!" and "Oh, Mr. Moseby!" He is very close to his heritage, which is revealed to be Peruvian in "I Want My Mummy". He is friends with Zack, Cody, and Maddie. It is revealed during the series that his full name is "Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya de la Rosa Ramírez". He owns a domestic chicken with blue feet named Dudley. Esteban wants to manage the Tipton, and he is a gifted dancer. He addresses the twins, Zack &amp; Cody, as "little blond peoples", even when he is only talking to one of them, in which case he often has to correct himself. Though he frequently does stupid, naïve, or clumsy things, he is more intelligent than he is given credit for and has a huge heart, which is shown throughout the series. In the dancing episode, after he and the nurse, Shannon Quine, dance, they are briefly shown kissing. It is also stated he is descended from royalty in several episodes and in one becomes temporarily rich because of his royal family. However, his royal family is deposed. In "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Hotel" it is revealed that Esteban has a crush on Carey. He guest-stars on "The Suite Life on Deck" in which he has his wedding on the SS "Tipton" with Francesca (Marisa Ramirez). It is also revealed in that episode that he has been promoted from bellhop to assistant night manager of the hotel. Being a recurring character, Esteban has appeared frequently throughout the show, only absent in a handful of episodes.
Lance Fishman.
Lance Fishman (played by Aaron Musicant) is the Tipton's handsome if somewhat slow-witted young lifeguard, who projects a relaxed and easy going demeanour, but harbours an almost unhealthy obsession with water. He is frequently shown in scenes trying to steer even the most mundane everyday conversations to swimming, the ocean, or sea creatures in some respect. He disrupts Maddie's student film ("Back in the Game") by insisting that she change his character to a merman, and suggesting she replace the front walk with a pool so that he can swim, rather than walk, to the hotel entrance. Later, during London's Halloween party he appears as "the Mighty Lobster". Nonetheless, Lance exhibits remarkable ease with picking up women, scoring dates with both Maddie (who at first had a crush on him) and London (despite her aversion to dating "the help"). Holding onto said women is another story: Maddie dumps him because she finds him dull, and London agrees to break up with him after he meets a woman called Wanda.
Wilfred Tipton.
Wilfred Tipton (voiced by Bob Joles on The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody and played by John Michael Higgins on The Suite Life on Deck) is the owner of Tipton hotels &amp; resorts and father to London Tipton. Until "The Suite Life on Deck" episode, "Twister: Part 3", his face had never been shown. He is usually surrounded by his bodyguards, with only his hand shown. It is not clear how he became the owner of the Tipton, because London mentions many times that her father bought the hotel. However, in a few episodes, it is said that Tipton's ancestors owned the hotel first before he did. This may yet be another example of London's ignorance, or a continuity error or that the Tiptons have not owned it for some time and he bought it back. In the episode "Rock Star in the House", Wilfred is very strict about London's behaviour when it comes to celebrities, and has much concern for her education and growing as a person. His hand was once seen in the episode "Lip Synchin' in the Rain", in which he was wearing a diamond ring. Wilfred Tipton also has a history of marrying much younger women without London's consent, most of whom do not last long. The warranty of Wilfred's wedding gifts (given by Mr. Moseby) lasted longer than the marriages.
In "The Suite Life on Deck" episode, "Twister: Part 3", Wilfred Tipton (played by John Michael Higgins) finally reveals himself, who is called by a reluctant Cody trying to rescue the Pickett Farm, although Wilfred Tipton buys the destroyed house to build a plastic bag factory. Cody tries to force Mr. Tipton out of the area by saying the dirt in the area contains powerful diseases, but Zack and Woody ruin the plot when they used peeling skin (Mr. Tipton said he watched a movie involving peeling skin). However, his daughter, London, seeing the strong emotions from the group, blackmails Wilfred. After the blackmail, Mr. Tipton leaves, but not before telling London he is proud of her.
Muriel.
Muriel (played by Estelle Harris; young Muriel played by Ashley Tisdale in flashback in the episode "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Hotel") is the saucy hotel maid who conceals her goodly nature beneath a veneer of acidic sarcasm, and spends more time sneaking in naps and robbing guests of loose change than doing any actual cleaning. She is a constant presence in Carey and the twins' suite, ostensibly "babysitting" but loitering on their couch watching TV and eating chocolates long after Carey has returned home. In "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Hotel", the cast discovers that Muriel once dated mobster Alphonse "Hot Peppers" DeLeo before joining the Tipton in 1938; Maddie and the twins easily spot her in an old newspaper clipping when they notice that the young lady in the picture is sitting with her feet up. In "Big Hair &amp; Baseball", Muriel claims that she knew Babe Ruth and was the first one to call him "Babe". Her catchphrase is "I'm not cleaning "that" up." She was specially called out of retirement in the series finale "Mr Tipton comes to Visit", by the twins, when they heard the reason for Mr. Tipton's visit is to fire an employee, in order for her to "get fired" instead (using her catchphrase), sparing the other characters their respective jobs.
Nia Moseby.
Nia Moseby (played by Giovonnie Samuels) is Mr. Moseby's niece. She has a part-time job at the candy counter, filling in for Maddie during her absence. She has come to work at the Tipton so that Mr. Moseby can get her to behave like a responsible girl. One of Nia's aunts, named Aunt Lilly, was supposed to take on this task, but Nia frustrated her so much that she changed her name and moved to Alaska. Nia appeared in seven episodes in Season 3. According to Mr. Moseby, she was expelled from her last school for fighting with the cafeteria lady because she was out of matzo ball soup. In the episode "First Day of High School", she is seen defending Zack from a bully. She is shown to be quite good at cheerleading in the episode "Benchwarmers".
Norman.
Norman (played by Anthony Acker) is the doorman for the Tipton Hotel, Norman's first appearance was in the episode "Free Tippy". He is also usually a background character, but is shown to have a hiding spot for Zack's belongings when he skips school in "What the Hey". Norman has four speaking parts in the episodes, "Neither a Borrower Nor a Speller Bee", "Ask Zack", "Nurse Zack" and "The Arwin That Came For Dinner".
Patrick.
Patrick (played by Patrick Bristow) is the maître d' for the Tipton Hotel's restaurant. One of the most sarcastic characters on the show, he treats everyone with disdain, especially Zack and Cody. However, in "Kisses and Basketball", he says to Zack "Take this from someone who cares about you, she is so out of your league" on Zack's date with Max. He likes coconut flavoured chewing gum, and dislikes Maddie because she does not stock it (as shown in the episode "Big Hair and Baseball"). He is seen in the Tipton Commercial in "Commercial Breaks", and has a girlish shriek, as shown in the episode "Heck's Kitchen". Due to London's generous tips, Patrick has been able to afford a foreign sports car (indicated in "Twins at the Tipton"). However, Mr. Moseby claims that Patrick wrecked it by crashing into fellow waiter Rich, and when the ambulance showed up, another waiter Gary got hit by the ambulance, leaving Mr. Moseby to take Patrick's place at the Tipton Restaurant. His favourite musical is "Bye Bye Birdie" as revealed in "Birdman of Boston".
Chef Paolo.
Chef Paolo (played by Jerry Kernion) is an Italian-American chef of the Tipton, seen in three episodes: "Heck's Kitchen", "Health and Fitness", and "Foiled Again". He is easily very insulted when people dislike his cooking. He is specialized in Italian food. Paolo enjoys eating, and bacon bits were found in his blood during a cholesterol test. Cody helped Chef Paolo overcome his eating issues in the episode "Health and Fitness". He is close to Cody and refers to him as "my little protege", because of Cody's natural talent for cooking. Paolo has quit his job several times (mostly due to London insulting his food), but always returns eventually. He names almost all of his foods after himself, except for one named after Cody.
Irene.
Irene (played by Sharon Jordan) is the concierge for the Tipton Hotel, Irene is usually seen working in the lobby. She has red curly hair. In "Boston Tea Party", she gets her first speaking part. On "That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana", Irene told Raven that her flight had been cancelled, much to Raven's dismay. Irene sabotaged Maddie's traveling candy cart in "Nurse Zack", to which Maddie alludes to Irene not having very many speaking parts by replying, "It's always the quiet ones". In "Orchestra", her speaking role was expanded when she had to teach London how to do her job. On "Let Us Entertain You', Mr. Moseby thinks Irene is answering a phone call for their marathon, but she is actually answering a personal call.
Millicent.
Millicent (played by Kara Taitz) is Maddie's replacement at the hotel's candy counter while she is at camp and in Antarctica saving the penguins. Millicent is easily frightened by anything, and has trouble making up her mind and make her decision. When she can't make up her mind, she usually faints. She stated in the episode "Team Tipton" that she has trust, abandonment, and fear issues. She frequently faints when overwhelmed with a request from someone else. In the episode "Team Tipton", London referred to her as 'Nervous Maddie'.
Skippy.
Skippy (played by Bo Crutcher) is the night-manager of the Tipton Hotel. He grew up on a farm and said his grandfather was scary. He is not very bright, and appears to be frightened of Mr. Moseby. He is so dim-witted that immediately after Mr. Moseby told him not to let Zack or Cody into the exhibit, he let them in anyway. He first appeared in "Scary Movie", but Mr. Moseby called him Sparky, although it is possible that Mr. Moseby did not know his name, because he called him his night-manager while in other episodes he calls him Skippy. Skippy was left in charge of the hotel in the episode "I Want My Mummy". Zack says that Skippy is so nice, that he would give anyone anything if they just asked, even his wallet.
Grace.
Grace (played by Naomi Chan) is an emotionless towel maid at the Tipton who appeared in "Ah! Wilderness" while Carey was painting. In "Orchestra", she is given the name Grace and attempts to teach London how to do her job.
Rich.
Rich (played by Chris Doyle) is an unfortunate waiter at the Tipton restaurant. Appears in "Odd Couples" and "Heck's Kitchen".
Scott.
Scott is the bagel boy at the Tipton Hotel. He first appears in the episode "Nurse Zack", during the employee of the month competition. His first speaking role comes in "Team Tipton" when he gives the cast bagels, saying: "Who ordered the bagels?"
Friends of Zack &amp; Cody.
Bob.
Bob (played by Charlie Stewart) is one of the boys' best friends. He is dyslexic. Zack meets him in school one day when he was moved into a regular class from a special education class because he was doing so well in it. He likes to play Total World Conquest with the boys and Cody's friends, Warren and Jeremy, though they almost never finish their games because Zack and Cody usually end up fighting. Bob, as shown in "Smart &amp; Smarteree" and "Odd Couples", is somewhat impatient. He speaks fluent French, as illustrated in the episode "French 101". In the episode, "Back in the Game", one of his beliefs is frequent, short naps. In "Forever Plaid", he states that his favourite subject is Science. Bob is shown to also be talented in well-made creating a very well made rocking chair. He has a sister, possibly his twin, as shown in "Election", and a younger brother mentioned in "Twins at the Tipton". Bob likes to visits Zack and Cody just because the doorman calls him "sir". He was Puck in the show's version of "A Midsummer Night's Dream", is on their basketball team and worked at the boys' club seen in "Club Twin" selling soda. Bob is very vulnerable to poison oak, shown in the episode "Ah! Wilderness". In the episode "Super Twins", he is the first and only child to be adultified by the Meanager (Moseby) – which causes the twins remark later that he has a booming insurance business. However, this is dropped when Zack turns back time at the end of episode. Bob is Zack and Cody's most frequent friend featured on the show with 16 appearances. He visits Zack and Cody on the SS "Tipton" once in "The Suite Life on Deck", which reveals he is now dating Cody's ex-girlfriend Barbara.
Max.
Max (played by Alyson Stoner) is one of Zack and Cody's friends, she is a girl who usually wears pigtails in Season 1 and is sometimes mistaken for a boy. She is a tomboy. She once had a crush on Zack as shown in the episode "Kisses &amp; Basketball", and goes on a date with him while showing her slightly girlie side but "falls out of love" with Zack when she finds out that he just did it to "take one for the team". Max is portrayed as a great dancer (as shown in the episodes "Footloser", "Hotel Hangout", and "Club Twin"), but can become extremely bossy at times ("Footloser").

She is a rude and severe woman with a large mole (or "beauty mark") on her face (which is oblivious to her, as she usually replies "Vat mole?"), who dislikes Mr. Moseby for making her lose her hotel inspector's job. After "Hotel Inspector", she got married. In "Cookin' With Romeo and Juliet" she says her name is Ilsa Shickelgrubermeiger-Von Helsinger Kepelugerhoffer. When Cody mentions that it must take forever to write on her underwear, she says she has a stamp. One of her dreams is to turn the Tipton Hotel into a parking lot, and have Mr. Moseby park the cars. In "Bowling", it appears that she has an odd sense of humor, as she says, "Left! Left! Left my husband with 28 kids! Right! Right! Right in the middle of the living room floor!" Some parts of her personality seem to be reminiscent of the Wicked Witch of the West from "The Wizard of Oz"; for instance, in the episode "Bowling" she states, "I'll get you next time, my pretty, and your little shtaff too!" She also uses the line, "I'll get you next time and your little dog too', in the episode "Hotel Inspector". In the episode "Bowling", Mr. Moseby makes a reference to "The Biggest Loser", the show Caroline Rhea hosted, by saying "Ha! Who's the biggest loser now!" Also in that episode, she actually compliments Carrie on her parenting skills by keeping Zack off the team as punishment for pranking Cody; however, she then follows it up with the insult that it's also bad coaching as Zack's the second-best bowler the Tipton team had. It is mentioned in a few episodes that she has a sausage dog named Blitzkrieg, who is rather vicious, merciless, and sadistic. London likened the dog to a piranha. Everyone is afraid of her and constantly stares at her mole.
The Mirrors.
The Mirrors (voiced by Brian Peck and Jim Meskimen in the original series; and Michael Airington in the sequel series) are London's free-standing talking mirrors (it was mentioned that there are more than one). They first appeared in the season 2 crossover episode "That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana". London stated that the mirrors were engineered by her father's scientists, and that they are programmed to only compliment her fashion while giving snobby fashion insults to others who stand in front of them. The mirror sounds like Paul Lynde who played Uncle Arthur in the series "Bewitched". It is implied several times that the mirrors have artificial intelligence, as they regularly make sarcastic comments about London's intelligence. The Mirror is a parody of the Magic Mirror used by the Evil Queen from the fairy tale "Snow White". The Mirror re-appears in the "Suite Life on Deck" season 3 episode "A London Carol" representing the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future in London's dream and also in the Suite Life On Deck season 2 episode "Once Upon a Suite Life" literally as the Magic Mirror from Snow White.
George.
Mr. George Forgess (played by Ernie Grunwald) is one of Zack and Cody's teachers from "Smart &amp; Smarterer". He is often shown as a nervous character and frequently stumbles over his words. It may be possible that he is dyslexic, like his special education student Bob, a friend of the twins. He later appears in "A Midsummer's Nightmare" as runner of the drama club, and in "Graduation" as the head of Zack and Cody's graduation. Mr. Forgess claims he drives his mother's car, which he says has chrome spinners. Mr. Forgess has appeared in three episodes throughout the series.
Snooty.
Snooty Saleswoman (played by Donna Cherry) appears in "Not So Suite 16" and "What the Hey". Snooty works in the jewelry and clothing department of a store.

The Snooty Saleswoman has appeared in two episodes throughout the series.
Portia.
Portia Tenenbaum is the never seen, rich frenemy of London. In some episodes, they are friends and in other episodes, they are competitors. The two speak by telephone and go on shopping trips together (most of the time to Paris). In the episode "Neither a Borrower Nor a Speller Bee", Portia had gained publicity doing charity works. London also competes with her for more fame on the Internet with her own web show called "Yay Me! Starring London Tipton". In "Cody Goes to Camp" Mr. Moseby was horrified at the thought that Portia might teach London how to drive as she once drove her father's yacht through piers 10, 11 and 12, because of being distracted putting on sunscreen. She is never seen.
Arturo Vitali.
Arturo Vitali is a fictitious famous fashion designer who is mentioned multiple times in the "Suite Life" franchise. He happens to be London's favourite designer, as she has been wearing his designs since she was in diapers, and only wears his designs. In "The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody" crossover episode "That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana", Maddie and Esteban switched the labels of one of Vitali's dresses (incorrectly spelled as A. Vitalli) and Raven Baxter's dress, to fool London into thinking she was wearing Vitali's design (but actually it was Raven's), since London was being a fashion-snob. Arturo Vitali finally made an appearance in The Suite Life on Deck episode "Frozen" (portrayed by Todd Sherry), where he retired to the SS "Tipton" because he was suffering from a creative block. London and Bailey eventually helped him overcome his creative block and inspired him to launch a new fashion line "Hick Chic" (inspired by Bailey's wardrobe), much to London's chagrin, who doesn't like Bailey's clothes. He is mentioned by Emma Ross in the season 2 episodes of "Jessie" "Trashin' Fashion", and then again in "Say Yes to the Messy Dress" where he sent Emma one of his designs for Jessie Prescott to wear at a red carpet event, which Emma would be covering on her hit fashion web-show "Kitty Couture".

They both appear in "Miniature Golf" as part of London's so-called book club and in "Who's The Boss?" while Chelsea was in the episode "Tiptonline" as a guest and temporary producer on London's web show "Yay Me". In "Who's the Boss" they have British accents. Tiffany has appeared in two episodes throughout the series, and Chelsea has been in three.

Animals.
While some of these animals appeared in only one episode, and therefore weren't physically recurring, they were mentioned in several episodes so their characters were recurring. For this reason they are included in this article.
Dudley is Esteban's pet chicken. He appeared on the episode "Commercial Breaks". After that, Esteban mentions him in some episodes. He appeared again on "Suite Life on Deck", in the episode "Mother of the Groom".

Zero-One United States Heavyweight Championship

The Zero-One United States Heavyweight Championship was a professional wrestling title in Japanese promotion Pro Wrestling Zero1. It was created on January 6, 2003, with Steve Corino defeating Masato Tanaka. In addition to Japan, it has recently been frequently defended in various independent companies in the United States.
The title was created at a time when the company was known as Pro Wrestling Zero-One, originally naming it the Zero-One United States Heavyweight Championship; on July 4, 2004, following Zero-One joining the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), the title was renamed the NWA/Zero-One United States Heavyweight Championship. On October 26, 2004, Zero-One left the NWA, removing its initials from the title and renaming it the Zero-One United States Openweight Championship. When the promotion's name was changed to Zero1-Max in 2005, the championship title followed. On March 25, 2007, the title again switched its name, this time to the Zero1-Max International Championship; however, on June 13, 2007, the International title was apparently stricken from the record, and was reverted to the US title. On April 12, 2008, it was renamed back to its original title by Steve Corino, in honor of Zero1-Max's late founder Shinya Hashimoto. There have been a total of 11 recognized champions who have had a combined 18 official reigns.

Palagnedra

Palagnedra is a village and a locality part of the municipality of Centovalli in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. Lago di Palagnedra is located below the village, on the Melezza river.
History.
Palagnedra is first mentioned in 1379 as "Pallagnidrio".
During the Middle Ages, Palagnedra was the administrative and religious center in the 13th-century Centovalli valley community. In the 16th century it became part of the Locarno and Ascona region, followed by the bailiwick of Locarno. In 1864 the village became independent.
The church of San Michele was built between 1640-1732 and renovated in 1964-66 and again between 1999 and 2001. It was the mother church of the Centovalli valley and contains the best preserved late gothic cycle of frescoes by Antonio da Tradate.
Traditionally the local economy was based around agriculture and grazing. Starting in the 16th century some of the income came from the seasonal migration to Italy. Initially, most of the seasonal workers were laborers. This changed in the 19th century to cooks going to Tuscany. Until the 1950s, the vicinity of the Italian Swiss border encouraged smuggling. In 1950-52 a hydroelectric dam was built. In 2005 about a third of the jobs in Palagnedra related to the agricultural sector.
On 25 October 2009 the municipalities of Borgnone, Intragna and Palagnedra merged into the municipality of Centovalli.
A large part of the community of Palagnedra is formed by the notorious family name "Mazzi"
Location.
The former municipality is located in the Locarno district on a terrace on the southern slope of the Centovalli. It includes various districts, including Bordei, Bolade and Crup.

The Glass Mountain (1949 film)

The Glass Mountain is a 1949 black and white British romantic film drama directed by Henry Cass. It starred Michael Denison, Dulcie Gray and Valentina Cortese. The film was a popular success of its day, and was re-released in the UK in 1950 and 1953. It features acclaimed classical vocalists Elena Rizzieri as herself and Tito Gobbi as himself, with the orchestra and chorus of the Venice Opera House. The theme music by Nino Rota is memorable, and was also a contemporary hit. It was mainly filmed on location in the Dolomites and at Venice's La Fenice Opera House. Co-producer Joseph Janni also co-produced another film shot in Italy, the comedy "Honeymoon Deferred", in 1951.
"The Guardian" wrote, "most reference books now deride the film, but at a time when Britain was emerging from the war into a period of grey austerity, The Glass Mountain and movies like it were a popular tonic. Set in the beautiful Dolomite mountains, with graceful performers and a nostalgically slow pace, it was one of the most successful British films to that date. The part of the composer was taken by Denison, with whom (Dulcie) Gray starred on stage and screen so many times that the Denisons became one of the "royal families" of the British entertainment scene."
A tale from peasant folklore concerns a mountain made of glass and a man's attempts to climb it, to win the love of a princess. For each step he takes, he slides back two steps; so, cleverly, he turns about and climbs it backwards, gaining double elevation with each downward step.
Plot.
The film begins in a boat on a river, where a couple find an idyllic riverside cottage to let, but know they cannot afford it. They marry and years pass. The war begins.
Struggling composer Richard Wilder (Michael Denison) becomes an RAF Observer in the Second World War. His aeroplane is shot down over the Italian Dolomite mountains, and he is found unconscious face down in the snow by Alida (Valentina Cortese), who consequently saves his life. She nurses him back to health. She tells him a local legend about two lovers - one a ghost who leads her faithless partner to his doom over a precipice on the Glass Mountain. The legend also says if you shout the name of the person you truly love, an echo will return.
When the war ends, Richard returns to England and his loving wife Anne (Dulcie Gray). He begins composing an opera based on the legend of Dolomite, the Glass Mountain, which has begun to haunt him.
On his wife's birthday, he sees a photograph of Alida on the cover of a magazine. Inside, a caption states that Alida Morisini has come to London to receive an honour. He tries to get in touch with her, but she has already left the country. From then on, he becomes more and more miserable. Anne eventually guesses he is in love with someone else; he confesses he loves Alida.
Richard returns to Italy - alone - and to Alida. The Teatro La Fenice is looking for an opera for their festival, and Tito Gobbi has told them about Richard's (unfinished) one. Meanwhile, Gino, a local man in love with Alida, asks Richard to leave. When he refuses, they fight, but nothing is settled. Richard tries to break up with Alida, but she persuades him not to. Richard's opera is chosen for the festival, so he sends for his lyricist, Bruce McLeod. Bruce tries to convince Alida it is best if she and Richard part.
Anne persuades her friend Charles to fly her to the premiere of Richard's opera "La Montagna di Cristallo" ("The Glass Mountain") in Venice. When they pass near the real Glass Mountain, she asks Charles to show it to her. He obliges, but they crash on the mountain.
The opera tells the tragic tale of Antonio and Maria. Antonio promises his beloved Maria that someday they will climb the Glass Mountain together. However, he goes away to the plain and does not return. Finally, Maria climbs the mountain alone and is never seen again. At Antonio's wedding to another woman, he hears Maria's voice and goes to the mountain to be reunited with her. He climbs and then falls to his death.
Richard conducts his own work and receives a standing ovation at its conclusion. Afterwards, Richard is told of Anne's accident by Alida. He must then choose between his muse and his wife, as the mythical and modern levels of the legend coincide. Alida sees that he has chosen Anne and bids him goodbye. Richard races to the mountain and insists on going out to meet the rescue party. Gino guides him. The doctor tells him that Anne is badly injured, but should recover. He decides life is meaningless without her.
Critical reception.
"TV Guide" wrote, "Cortese's performance is outstanding; Denison and Gray, husband and wife in reality, handle their familiar relationship well, but the real stars of the picture are the music, with operatic baritone Gobbi, and the beautiful mountain scenery."
Bosley Crowther, "The New York Times" critic, was unimpressed, writing, "It is pedestrian stuff saved from being banal by a few performances, the authentic backgrounds and some lilting arias."
"Time Out" called it "solidly directed, lavishly mounted romantic tosh."
"Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide" described it as a "beautifully made film of a British composer who writes an opera, inspired by majestic Italian Alps. A treat for music lovers, with many singers from La Scala appearing in opera sequence."

Alice Fisher (nurse)

Alice Fisher (13 June 1839 – 2 June 1888) was a nursing pioneer. During her brief career at the Philadelphia General Hospital (PGH) she improved the standards of care at the institution and created the hospital's nursing school.
Early life.
Fisher's father was both an astronomer, at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and a priest. Fisher was born in England. Before leaving home she wrote two novels, "Too Bright to Last", 1873, and a three-volume "His Queen", which was published in 1875. In 1874, after her father's death in 1873, she started training as a nurse at the Nightingale Training School and Home for Nurses, now part of King's College London.
Career.
After completing her training, she nursed briefly at two hospitals, the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and the Fever Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne. She then became superintendent, also briefly, at three other British hospitals, where she made significant improvements in the standard of nursing: Addenbrooke's, at Cambridge; the Birmingham General Hospital, where she instituted a nursing school; and the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, where she instituted lectures for the nursing staff. With a fellow Nightingale nurse, Rachel Williams, she produced an early book on nursing, "Hints to Hospital Nurses".
Fisher made occasional visits to her mentor, Florence Nightingale. The two corresponded; letters Fisher wrote to Nightingale on conditions in her posts are at the British Library, but Nightingale's letters have not been found. 
She moved to the United States in 1884 and was appointed Superintendent at the Philadelphia General Hospital, also known as the Blockley Hospital. She was charged with transforming nursing and medical care at the deteriorated institution, where she instituted dramatic improvement in standards of care, and created the hospital's nursing school.
Death.
She died of heart disease in 1888, only 13 years after starting training, but had been very productive; her obituary in the British Medical Journal said that during her time at PGH "an impetus was given to the improvement of nursing which has been felt almost throughout the United States". Her burial site at The Woodlands Cemetery lies adjacent to the former hospital grounds and, for decades, was the site of a procession of nursing students from PGH and other hospitals in the region.

Enzyme potentiated desensitization

Enzyme potentiated desensitization (EPD), is a treatment for allergies developed in the 1960s by Dr. Leonard M. McEwen in the United Kingdom. EPD uses much lower doses of antigens than conventional desensitization treatment paired with the enzyme β-glucuronidase. EPD is approved in the United Kingdom for the treatment of hay fever, food allergy and intolerance and environmental allergies.
EPD was developed for the treatment of autoimmune disease by the United Kingdom company Epidyme which was owned by Dr. McEwen and had been granted a United Kingdom patent. Despite encouraging results in an experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis, the company was placed into liquidation in April 2010.
United States use.
EPD was available in the United States until 2001, when the Food and Drug Administration revoked approval for an investigative study which it had previously sanctioned. That study had allowed EPD to be imported into the United States without being licensed. The approval was revoked because the EPD treatments included complex mixtures of allergens that were not allowed under FDA rules. Since 2001, the FDA has banned importation of EPD for the following reasons:
A related treatment, Low Dose Allergens (LDA), was developed in the US by Dr. Shrader, which, being a compounding rather than a drug, is not regulated by the FDA. In addition, LDA uses a different allergen mix for the US environment. However, LDA is considered by many in the field to be a repackaging of EPD that circumvents the FDA guidelines that caused EPD to be revoked.
EPD treatment.
The enzyme beta glucuronidase appears to potentiate the desensitizing effect of a small dose of allergen. The quantities of both are smaller than those occurring naturally in the body, but not so small that they can be regarded as homeopathic. Intradermal injections are used. The treatment takes 3–4 weeks before any effect is seen. For food and environmental allergies and intolerances treatments are typically given at two monthly intervals at first, but the interval between treatments is gradually lengthened. Hay fever is treated with two shots of EPD outside the pollen season.
Mechanism for EPD.
The treatment uses dilutions of allergen and enzyme to which T-regulatory lymphocytes are believed to respond by favouring desensitization, or down-regulation, rather than sensitization. Once activated these lymphocytes travel to lymph nodes and reproduce or stimulate similar T-lymphocytes.
Evidence for the Effectiveness of EPD.
EPD is considered experimental by some doctors and allergists. However, there is evidence for the efficacy of EPD in the treatment of hay fever and other conditions as a result of nine placebo-controlled, double-blind trials involving 271 patients. These trials showed a significant improvement in the symptoms with probabilities of 0.001 to 0.01 (a chance of one in a thousand to one in a hundred that the results of the trial would be seen by chance alone assuming EPD had no effect). However, one trial involving 183 patients published in the "British Medical Journal" showed no overall effect. Dr Len McEwen, inventor of EPD, speculated that the reason for the failure might have been that the beta glucuronidase enzyme preparation was inadvertently heated or frozen during storage in the hospital pharmacy, as it is sensitive to the storage temperature and enzyme from the same manufactured batch had been used to treat a number of patients successfully. However, there is no evidence available after the event to test this theory as the remaining trial materials were destroyed immediately after the trial ended.
Safety of EPD.
While the efficacy of EPD is sometimes the subject of controversy among the medical community, the safety of EPD is demonstrated in one study under the control of an Investigational Review Board and reported by the American EPD Society. 5,400 patients received at least 3 doses of EPD with no severe reactions reported.
Comparison of EPD with conventional escalating-dose immunotherapy (hyposensitization).
By contrast, uncontrolled use of conventional (escalating dose) immunotherapy (hyposensitization not EPD) for general allergic conditions was believed to be responsible for at least 29 deaths in the UK, and is now banned in the United Kingdom except in hospital under close observation. A working party of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology reviewed the role of conventional high dose specific allergen immunotherapy (not EPD) in the treatment of allergic disease and recommends high dose specific allergen immunotherapy for treating summer hay fever uncontrolled by conventional medication and for wasp and bee venom hypersensitivity. For the recommended indications the risk:benefit ratio was found to be acceptable for conventional immunotherapy provided patients are carefully selected; in particular, patients with asthma should be excluded and injections should be given only by allergists experienced in this form of treatment in a clinic where resuscitative facilities are available and patients remain symptom free for an observation period after injection which is sufficient to detect all serious adverse reactions.
Conventional escalating-dose immunotherapy (not EPD) has been used to treat tens of millions of people in the United States with appropriate medical supervision with a death rate of less than one in one million according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology.
Restrictions on EPD.
EPD has not been developed for treatment of allergy to insect stings (for which convenventional immunotherapy is recommended),
nor for contact dermatitis and allergy to drugs. It is not FDA approved.

Indemini

Indemini () is a former municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
On 25 April 2010, the former municipalities of Caviano, Contone, Gerra Gambarogno, Indemini, Magadino, Piazzogna, San Nazzaro, Sant'Abbondio and Vira Gambarogno merged into the new municipality of Gambarogno.
History.
Indemini is first mentioned in 1260 as "Indemine". In the Middle Ages it was part of the "Vicinanza" of Gambarogno. In the 17th century there were disputes over alpine pastures and forest owned by the village cooperatives of the Valle Veddasca and the Malcantone. In 1752, these border disputes were resolved with the Treaty of Varese. In 1800, the Helvetic government considered exchanging Indemini for Campione d'Italia in the Cisalpine Republic.
A vice-parish was formed in 1556 after they broke away from the parish of Vira. The church of San Bartolomeo, which is probably built before 1213, was expanded in the 17th century and renovated in the 19th century.
The village was isolated for most of its history. It wasn't until 1917–18 that a roadway was built on the Swiss side. A road from Italy wasn't built until 1964. The isolation helped Indemini to retain its rural appearance. In the past, the village economy relied on agriculture, but it declined in importance in the 1970s and 80s. During most of the year, the village is mostly abandoned, but in the summer season the population expands rapidly.
Geography.
Indemini has an area, , of . Of this area, or 1.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 78.3% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 1.1% is settled (buildings or roads), or 0.6% is either rivers or lakes and or 13.3% is unproductive land.
Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 0.5% and transportation infrastructure made up 0.4%.

Miscellaneous stories.
"The Goddess of Death".
"The Goddess of Death" was Hodgson's first published story, and appeared in 1904 in "Royal Magazine".
A village is terrorized by a number of murders by strangulation, and the chief suspect is a statue of the goddess Kali stolen from a Thugee temple. The narrator is a visitor who believes there must be a rational explanation, but he finds it increasingly difficult to explain what is going on when the town's mysterious 8-foot statue is missing from its base and he sees what looks like the statue itself running through the night, carrying a cloth garotte.
Recruiting a friend to help him, the narrator leads a group to find the statue before it kills again. A volunteer is killed, but the narrator shoots at the statue, which disappears into a lake. Things look hopeless until the narrator consults the private journal of the Colonel who brought the statue from India. He learns of a secret catch in the statue's base which lowers and raises it, and which allows entry into a secret passage. Someone has been living inside the secret passage, and at its end, where the tunnel reaches the lake, he sees what appears to be another statue in the water. As he tries to pull it out, he realizes that it is an enormous "Hindoo" (Hindu) high priest wearing a white gown and a mask to imitate the statue; the bullets in fact did reach their mark and the mysterious man is dead. He was a "high priest" who had come to avenge the destruction of his temple.
"Terror of the Water-Tank".
This story was first published in 1907 in "Blue Book Magazine".
 Hodgson introduces the story as follows:
Crowning the heights on the outskirts of a certain town on the east coast is a large, iron water-tank from which an isolated row of small villas obtains its supply. The top of this tank has been cemented, and round it have been placed railings, thus making it a splendid "look-out" for any of the townspeople who may choose to promenade upon it. And very popular it was until the strange and terrible happenings of which I have set out to tell.
The "strange and terrible happenings" begin with the discovery of a murder victim on the tank; he died by strangulation. The strangled man is the father of the narrator's fiancee, which leads to the narrator's involvement in the story. A local man named Dr. Tointon has been investigating; he has found that the strangled man's watch and watch chain are missing. The narrator notices that the mud around the tank is undisturbed, indicating that no one passed that way.
No real progress is made until several days later when a policeman who had been patrolling the tank is also found dead; he has been strangled as well. Although witnesses heard the man die, and would have seen anyone leaving the tank via the stairs, the mud beside the tank remains undisturbed. Tointon tells the narrator that he has not yet formed a conclusion, but will speak to him the following day.
The next day comes, but Tointon sends the narrator a note asking him to delay their meeting until late that evening. While waiting, the narrator questions Dufirst, the tank-keeper, a bearded black man whom he considers "an ugly little beast." In Dufirst's cottage the narrator discovers the first strangled man's missing watch and watch chain. The narrator summons the nearby police inspector and has Dufirst arrested. Later that evening we learn that the doctor is still out of town and has become seriously ill.
In the weeks that follow, Dufirst is tried and convicted of the first murder and scheduled for hanging. When Dr. Tointon recovers and returns, he is shocked to learn what has happened, believing that Dufirst is innocent. He assembles a team to investigate the water-tank that evening, bringing along a police constable, a loaded shotgun and several lanterns. Covering the lanterns, they hold a silent vigil on top of the tank. In the dead of night, a "very slight, slurring, crawling sort of noise" is heard. The lanterns are uncovered, and the doctor fires his shotgun.
The constable is found lying on the tank, but he is not dead—he has simply fainted from fright. The perpetrator is a "writhing yellow something, like an eel or a snake... flat as a ribbon." This creature has emerged from the tank, via a pipe, and climbed up onto the railing around the tank. The doctor's belief is confirmed; we learn that when he investigated the original crime he discovered slime on the tank railings and moisture on the collars of the victims. The exact nature of the creature remains a mystery, as its head has been destroyed by the shotgun blast, but the doctor believes that it is an abnormal creature because it developed under "abnormal conditions."
"Bullion".
This story was first published in 1911 in "Everybody's Weekly"
A ship is transporting a valuable cargo of gold bullion packed into chests, and stored in a separate locked and sealed room. But when mysterious whispering is heard in the night, an investigation leads the first mate to think he is losing his mind; first chests are missing, and then they aren't!
The narrator, who is the ship's second mate, is aboard "one of the fast clipper-ships running between London and Melbourne at the time of the big gold finds up at Bendigo." The captain, named Reynolds, complains to him of a strange whispering in his cabin, and asks if the second mate will trade cabins with him. The previous captain, Captain Avery, had previously died in the room, of no known cause. Although the second mate agrees to the switch, believing the captain's concern to be nonsense, in a few nights he is hearing a mysterious whispering as well. The ship carries a very valuable cargo of gold bullion, so the mate gives orders to open and examine the special compartment holding the gold, which is positioned just below the captain's cabin in the lazarette. He awakens the captain, and they enter the lazarette and examine the compartment. The whispering can clearly be heard, but again the source of it cannot be found. The second mate and captain open the sealed room, and find that the thirteenth of the sixty chests is missing! However, when the captain leaves and returns with the purser, and they examine the chests again, they are all present and accounted for. No explanation can be found.
A round-the-clock guard is set up. The three officers (the captain and the two mates) take turns sleeping inside the bullion compartment itself, locked in with the gold, while the petty officers keep watch, pacing around the bullion compartment twenty-four hours a day. The guard inside the room is woken every hour to confirm that the chests are all there. When it is time for the narrator to stand guard, he awakens groggily to discover that a number of chests are missing, but believes that he must be dreaming. When he awakens, the chests are all in place. Shortly thereafter, the first mate actually dies during his watch, again of no apparent cause. No explanation can be found, although the strange whispering is heard again.
After the ship docks in London, bank officials come on board to remove the gold. Everything seems normal, and the watch is in place, but when the door into the bullion compartment is opened, the first mate on guard inside is found to be dead, again of no apparent cause. When the bullion is removed, all seems in order, until the bank reports that all of the chests actually contain lead! As additional cargo is unloaded, an especially heavy case arouses the second mate's suspicion, and he has the man operating the crane "accidentally" drop a case. It bursts open, and chests of gold bullion are found. An elaborate plot is revealed, in which conspirators brought aboard identical chests containing lead, stored in other cargo; the special compartment to hold the bullion was built with a sliding door and connection to a secret passage. In the dead of night the thieves gradually swapped the chests. To avoid detection by the guard inside the compartment they used a narcotic gas. Too low a dose allowed the second mate to awaken and see the chests missing; but too high a dose killed the first mate. The same narcotic gas evidently killed the previous captain, who was gassed to keep him from learning too much about the theft going on directly beneath his cabin.
"The Mystery of the Water-Logged Ship".
This story was first published in 1911 in the "Grand Magazine".
A yacht comes perilously close to colliding with a swamped, dismasted, derelict vessel; only the captain's instincts prevent the crash, as he sees a flash of light in the darkness. The source of the light cannot be found, but the yacht's spotlight picks out the derelict. Investigating the vessel, the crew of the yacht decides to tow it, in order to collect money for salvage. They arrange a tow-line, and leave a skeleton crew of four volunteers, together with the bo'sun, aboard. A little later, the captain of the yacht is shocked to discover that the towline is no longer connected and the ship is a considerable distance from the yacht. The crewmen aboard the vessel are gone.
The same scenario plays out again; the second mate leads another group of volunteers, but the line is again found disconnected and the men gone. No explanation is found. The yacht keeps a close watch on the ship all night, and in the morning the crew again boards the derelict and inspects it thoroughly. A half-dozen armed men are left aboard, this time under the direction of the third officer. At dusk the mate's whistle is heard, and there is a loud shouting from the derelict, but by the time the crew of the yacht investigates again, the men are gone.
Finally, the crew of the yacht set up an iron-barred cage on the deck of the derelict, with a group of armed men inside, and they hold a vigil while the yachts hover expectantly nearby, ready to turn their spotlight on the derelict. In the dead of night a strange noise is heard, and the men in the cage fire a gun. The yacht trains its spotlight squarely onto the derelict ship, and the men are astonished to see that the rigging of the derelict ship is full of pirates. In the ensuing gun battle, all the pirates are killed. The derelict is not really flooded; while the upper part of the hold is filled with water and floating timber, it has been retrofitted with an airtight compartment underneath, accessible through the hollow lower masts, and is complete with electric lights, ventilation fans, and motive power. The lost men are found below, bound in chains but unharmed amidst a king's ransom in stolen gold.
"The Ghosts of the "Glen Doon"".
This story was first published in 1911 in "The Red Magazine".
Another floating derelict is the subject of an investigation because of a mysterious tapping. A brave (or foolhardy) man bets that he can spend the night aboard the allegedly haunted ship. Is the tapping noise produced by the ghosts of the men who drowned when it sank, or is there a more prosaic explanation?
We learn that the iron ship "Glen Doon" "turned turtle" (flipped upside-down) and trapped ten workers aboard. For twenty-four hours the ship floated upside-down. The tapping of the workers' hammers on the hull led rescuers to attempt to drill holes in the ship, but this just allowed the air to escape faster, and the men were drowned as the ship sank.
Seven months later, the ship was bought at auction and raised, although she then sat idle for another five years. No living soul is aboard her, but in the dead of night mysterious tapping can be heard, allegedly the ghosts of the drowned men. Larry Chaucer, the young son of a wealthy local, wagers that he can spend the night alone aboard the ship unmolested.
He and a number of his friends first climb aboard and investigate; aside from some silt, the ship appears completely empty, yet the faint tapping can be heard, although its precise source cannot be located. As they inspect the ship the tapping ceases. The men withdraw to a boat near the ship and to the dock to listen for trouble, leaving Chaucer aboard to perform his vigil. As they wait, the tapping sound resumes, audible even across the bay. Suddenly the firing of a pistol is heard, and then a scream. The men race for the ship, but the young daredevil can't be found. Only his empty pistol and his lantern remain. As the men explore the hold, a strange sound is heard, as if someone were ascending through the stillness of the hold, but no one can be seen. The men hastily leave the hold.
Days pass, and the police investigate in excruciating detail; Larry Chaucer's wealthy father is involved. The ship is emptied completely; the silt is removed, and the internal bulkheads are removed until the "Glen Doon" is little more than an iron shell. Nothing is found. Police officers keep watch on board, and patrol-boats are stationed near the hulk, looking for any clue, as fruitless weeks pass. One night the hammering sound starts again, and as armed detectives keep watch on the deck they see:
...a man's head and face, the hair as long as a woman's, and dripping with sea water, so that the cadaverous face showed white and unwholesome from out of the sopping down-hang of the hair. In a minute there followed the body of the strange man, and the sea water ran from his garments, glistening as the moon-breams caught the drops. He came inboard over the rail, making no more noise than a shadow, and paused, swaying with a queer movement full in a patch of moonlight. Then, noiseless, he seemed to glide across the deck in the direction of the dark gape of the open main hatchway.
Although the men try to stop him, and fire at him, the figure disappears into the hold, and no trace of him can be found. Investigation continues. Mechanics are hired to drill holes into the sides of the ship, demonstrating that there are no secret compartments. They even drill into the bottom of the ship, patching the holes with hot lead to prevent the ingress of water. The hollow steel lower masts are investigated as well, and found to be empty. The search looks hopeless until the police inspector discovers a single hair stuck in a nearly invisible metal seam in a hollow mast. A secret door into the mast is discovered and opened. At the bottom of the hollow mast, a secret passage is found, leading down into a shaft that opens into another vessel, made from discarded boilers welded together, suspended below the "Glen Doon". In it is a band of counterfeiters stamping coins; this is the source of the mysterious tapping. The miscreants are apprehended. Larry Chaucer presumably met his death at the hands of the counterfeiters.
"Mr. Jock Danplank".
This story was first published in 1912 in "The Red Magazine".
Mr. Jock Danplank, a British citizen who has spent time living in the United States, has come into a substantial inheritance that includes not only money but a cottage complete with gardening and housekeeping staff and a stunningly beautiful garden. But Danplank's deceased uncle neglected to tell anyone just where the money was to be found. Near death, he was heard to mutter "seventy-seven feet due east", but was unable to finish his instructions.
Danplank and his wife, Mary, take possession of the cottage and examining a large, ornate desk, attached to the floor, that was also part of the bequest. During the days and nights that follow, it becomes clear that Danplank's cousin is also trying to locate the money; he repeatedly invades the cottage grounds and angers the aged head gardener by trampling on the flower-beds; he even digs enormous pits on the grounds in the dead of night.
As the story reaches its climax Danplank and his wife arrange a surprise for the cousin. They silently observe him tampering with the ornate table in the cottage, and afterwards, while he and his confederates are digging another deep pit in the gardens, fill the pit with water and photograph him clambering out, covered with mud. The cousin's examinations have given them a clue, and they discover that by putting the table back in its original position they are able to use the compass rose in the desktop to locate the treasure. The story ends with another common Hodgson motif: a snide letter to the cousin, enclosing proofs of the photographs (for potential blackmail or criminal prosecution) and indicating that the treasure has been found.
Hodgson may have intended to introduce Jock Danplank as another recurring character. However, he did not use Danplank again. Sam Moskowitz in his introduction to the story collection "Out of the Storm" writes that the plot "...provides an inconsequential bit of fiction, interesting only for the clever utilization of photography in the story." (Hodgson was a noted photographer).
"The Mystery of Captain Chappel".
This story was first published in 1917 in "The Red Magazine".
A mysterious murder has taken place. Because the victim was observed leaving a pub and then found dead nearby, only a minute later, having traversed only a short distance on an empty street with high walls on either side, police are baffled. The initial setup is presented as a locked room mystery, in which the murder appears impossible given the circumstances. Cobbler Juk, the uncle of the police officer investigating, is informally recruited, and turns out to be a talented amateur sleuth. A second murder takes place, this time of Saddler Atkins.
The cobbler believes that he knows who will be killed next, and so he and his nephew the police officer stake out the home of Councillor Tomkins, waiting. What they see is quite baffling: a seven-foot creature, emitting disturbing, inhuman noises, observes the councillor, then crashes through a window and attacks him, with the cobbler and constable giving chase. The creature escapes, but Tomkins is dead.
We next join the cobbler in surveillance of a black man, whom they accost outside his home. He fights off the cobbler; in his home the cobbler finds an object, which is not revealed to the reader.
In the conclusion the cobbler explains the whole story: he has uncovered evidence that the three dead men worked together, many years ago, on a ship that was apparently involved in illegal seal poaching. The black man worked for the three, and to guarantee his silence the three cut out his tongue. The black man has been working his revenge, wearing a costume in the shape of a seal head. The cobbler tracked the man by an idiosyncratic habit: while waiting for his victims, he drops the matches that he uses to light his pipe, after tearing them in two and twisting them in a distinct manner. These twisted half-matches were found at the first two crime scenes and also in the floor-sweepings from a local pub.
"The Home-Coming of Captain Dan".
This story was first published in 1918 in "The Red Magazine".
Captain Dan himself is a very colorful character who speaks in a mixture of nautical argot and gutter French.
"Merciful Plunder".
This story was first published in 1925 in "Argosy-Allstory Weekly".
A sea captain named Mellor is carrying out trading in a seaport on the Adriatic coast; the seaport is involved in "the wars so common in the Balkans." Mortar and rifle fire is audible in the distance, but Captain Mellor is more disturbed to hear the horrible sounds of a mass execution of twenty minors, who had been fighting as irregular guerilla warriors, in the town square. Twenty more youths remain locked in the local jail awaiting execution the next morning. Mellor, pretending to support the executions and displaying little sympathy for the youths, gets a tour from a Frenchman. Mellor observes the pitiful condition of the prisoners, and watches as a guard puts out a cigarette against one boy's leg; he also learns the layout of the jail building and the location and number of the guards.
That night, Mellor leads a daring raid. A cliff edge lies behind and above the jail, and with his chief engineer George and two other crewmen, in the dark of night they put into place a spar and pulley to lower the captain and his chief engineer to the jail window. While they are nearly caught, with the help of the boys they manage to remove the window bars with a hacksaw; the boys kill one guard with one of the bars, and the captain manages to incapacitate two others. The boys are removed through the window and spirited away aboard Mellor's ship. The Frenchman never learns by what means the boys have miraculously disappeared, although he remains appalled by Mellor's outward cavalier attitude, telling him "the good God was kinder than you."
"The Haunting of the "Lady Shannon"".
The story was first published in 1916 in the Premier Magazine.
A young seaman on board the "Lady Shannon", discussing Captain Teller and his cruelty and violent tendencies, encourages the other seamen to stand up to the man. Overhearing the discussion are three apprentices. The fate of another seaman, Toby, at the hands of the captain and second mate is revealed:
"Last trip they treated one of the ordinaries so badly that the poor chap went queer -- silly. Mind you, he acted like a goat and gave both the second mate and the skipper slack; but they knocked all that out of him and some of his brains as well, I believe. Anyway, he went half-dotty before the end of the voyage."
A few days later, Seaman Jones, a vocal advocate of standing up for himself, bites off a plug of tobacco and is noticed by the second mate. He refuses to throw his tobacco overboard and the mate attacks him. They fight, and Jones severely injures the mate. The captain begins shouting and firing his revolver, although he only wounds one man by accident. The first mate also attacks Jones; in the fracas, the captain throws his revolver and accidentally strikes the first mate, who is knocked unconscious. One of the apprentices, Tommy, involuntarily shouts "Hurray!" and is attacked by the captain, who beats him, knocking him unconscious. Jones meanwhile attacks the second mate, and is also knocked unconscious, while the first mate has recovered. At the end of the complicated fracas Tommy, the second mate, and Jones are all unconscious. The second mate recovers with the administration of whiskey.
Two nights later, Jones is still only semi-conscious. As the second mate keeps watch, he abruptly screams and falls; he is found to be dead of a stab wound, although the weapon and the source of the attack are unknown; the attack seemed to come out of nowhere, right under the captain's watchful eye. The captain is deeply disturbed, and musters the entire crew for inspection. Everyone is present and accounted for, except Jones and Tommy. We learn that, in the opinion of the first mate, Jones is near death, and the apprentice Tommy is also still too badly injured to have committed the murder. The captain and the first mate are baffled, and become suspicious that the cause was supernatural.
The next day the captain becomes hopelessly drunk; the first mate disposes of the second mate's body, and repeatedly checks on the state of seaman Jones. The first mate goes on watch that evening. During his watch, he sends an older sailor repeatedly to check on Jones; at 2:30 a.m., the seaman reports that Jones has died. A disturbing grating sound is immediately heard, and the first mate, his imagination working overtime, becomes agitated, believing Jones' ghost may be coming for him. We learn that Tommy is also doing poorly, which only adds the mate's fears.
That evening, the captain and the mate keep watch together. After the moonrise, a "strange husky inhuman gurgle" is heard from the bridge, and a "low, incredible, abominable laughter." The mate panics, screaming "he's come for me!" and running to the bridge; he is suddenly stabbed. A figure comes at the captain: "something white and slender that ran upon the captain noiselessly." The captain, panicked, crashes into the steel side of the deck-house and is knocked unconscious. The figure vanishes overboard, apparently without a splash.
In the aftermath, we learn that the white figure was Toby, the ordinary seaman, who had been "hazed to the verge of insanity by the brutality of the captain and the officers on the previous voyage." He was covered with flour, and apparently had been living as a stowaway in among the cargo; he had stabbed the officers from a vantage point hidden in a ventilator. In conclusion, the story tells us that
Tommy regained his health, as did both Captain Jeller and Jacob, the mate; but as a "hardcase" skipper and a "buck-o-mate", they are no longer shining examples.
"The Heathen's Revenge".
This story was first published in 1988 in chapbook form as "The Way of the Heathen."
"The Shamraken Homeward-Bounder".
This is considered by some editors such as Jeremy Lassen to be one of Hodgson's finest short stories. It features a remarkable crew of aged sailors who seem to have been at sea for decades; even the one they call the "boy" is fifty years old.
"The Albatross".
First published in the American pulp magazine "Adventure. "
An albatross is captured on a ship and a message is found tied to it which tells of a water-logged boat where a woman is alone with a ship full of rats. She only has a week's supplies left and as their ship is becalmed, one man takes it on himself to rescue her by rowing to her distant vessel and taking on the rats.
"The Stone Ship".
An earthquake raises a section of the seabed in the night, bringing with it a strange ship from ages past and stranger creatures from the sea bottom to menace a ship's crew.
"Jack Grey, Second Mate".
A ship sets out from Frisco with a strangely acting passenger and a crew scraped up off the waterfront. Things quickly escalate from unpleasant to grim in this violent tale. - From Pulpgen.com
"The Girl with the Grey Eyes".
Hodgson is not known as a writer of romantic stories, although several of his novels contain themes of romantic love amidst the horror and adventure. This is one of a small number of stories that he wrote specifically targeted to female readers of romance magazines.
"On the Bridge".
This story, presented as a factual minute-by-minute account of events on the bridge of a ship as it navigates through iceberg-filled waters, was actually written to capitalize on interest in the sinking of the Titanic.
"Through the Vortex of a Cyclone".
A four-masted ship is absorbed by a terrible cyclone storm; an excellent example of the fight between man and nature. The atmosphere is masterly graduated; the story begins among the quiet waters of the ocean beneath clear and blue sky, but gradually the horizont is getting darker, a strange voice is heard, then the ship is plunged into the monstrous hurricane. Then, when it is exactly in the Vortex (the center of the cyclone), the crew members fire an old pistol loaded with a flash-dust and they see the legendary Pyramidal Sea, a sea raised to a high water-hills, while the cry of the cyclone is circulating around them in a distance of several tens of miles. Though not being a fiction or horror story, this tale belongs to the best Mr. Hodgson ever wrote.
"The Captain of the Onion Boat".
Hodgson is not known as a writer of romantic stories, although several of his novels contain themes of romantic love amidst the horror and adventure. This is one of a small number of stories that he wrote specifically targeted to female readers of romance magazines.
A sea captain is torn between love and respect for duty as he watches the love of his life go about her daily routine in a convent. She entered the convent when he disappeared and she believed he was dead. Eventually at the urging of his first mate, the captain attracts her attention, arranges a liaison, and retrieves the willing woman who then faces an unknown future on an onion boat.

Elisabeth Cummings

Elisabeth Cummings (born 1934, Brisbane) is an Australian artist known for her large abstract paintings and printmaking. She has won numerous awards including Fleurieu Art Prize, The Portia Geach Portrait Prize, The Mosman Art Prize, and The Tattersalls Art Prize. Her work is owned in permanent collections across Australia including Artbank, The Queensland Art Gallery, The Gold Coast City Art Gallery and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. She is notable for receiving recognition later in her career, considered by the Australian Art Collector as one of the 50 most collectible Australian Artists.
Early life.
Elisabeth Cummings was born on 3 June 1934 in Brisbane, Queensland. During the Second World War Cumming’s family evacuated Brisbane and lived in the country before returning to live in Alderley. The family home in Alderley was surrounded by bushlands. The Cummings family owned a holiday home at Currumbin on the Gold Coast where Cummings, as a child, would paint watercolour landscapes. Currumbin and the Australian bush are now regular subjects in her landscape paintings. Cummings and her brother, Malcolm, would draw still lifes constructed by their mother, who was a primary school teacher, until her father said "let the kids draw what they want.” Cummings’ father, Robert Cummings, was an architect, a Professor of Architecture at the University of Queensland, an art collector and trustee of the Queensland Art Gallery. Cummings would regularly attend paint workshops run by Australian Artist Vida Lahey at the Queensland Art Gallery.
Education.
During her youth, the Cummings home was visited frequently by artists including Donald Friend, and Len and Kathleen Shillam. Cummings initially wanted to pursue architectural training but decided to enroll in art school after meeting and painting with Margaret Cilento. She studied at the National Art School, then known as East Sydney Technical College, from 1953 to 1957 where she was educated by artists Douglas Dundas, Wallace Thornton, Dorothy Thornhill, Godfrey Miller and Ralph Balson. At art school, Cummings was exposed to the work of fellow young Australian artists which she found to be formative to her practice. The artists Cummings cites as influential during this period include Grace Cossington Smith, Margaret Preston, Fred Williams, Russell Drysdale, Sydney Nolan, John Olsen and Jimmy Rose.
In 1958, Cummings received the NSW Traveling Art Scholarship and in 1960 the Dyason Bequest, both of which facilitated her travel through Europe for the next decade. In 1961 she studied at Kokoschka’s School of Vision run by Oskar Kokoschka in Salzburg, Austria before travelling to Florence, Italy. She spent the next 10 years living and studying between Italy and Paris. In Florence she shared a villa with other artists, where she met her husband, fellow painting student Jamie Barker. Cumming’s work was informed by European and Australian predecessors such as Pierre Bonnard, Henri Matisse, Paul Cézanne, Pablo Picasso, Édouard Vuillard and Margaret Olley. In 1968, she returned to Australia and settled in Sydney. In 1969 she started teaching at East Sydney Technical College on a part-time basis.
Work.
Elisabeth Cummings is a multi-disciplinary artist and celebrated colourist painter, working within painting, printmaking, drawing and ceramics. Inspired by the Australian bush, and a sense of place and memory, which are themes in Cumming’s semi-abstract landscapes, interiors and still life paintings. Cumming’s starts her paintings by drawing multiple quick sketches of the scene which form the basis for her final full-sized work. John McDonald describes her painting style as "[t]hick, heavily worked, painterly surfaces with complex marks and intense colour". Notable paintings from Cummings body of work include interiors, "Journey Through The Studio" painted in 2004 and "Inside The Yellow Room", 2005. Her landscape paintings include "Arkaroola landscape," 2005, which was rejected from the Wynne Prize, "Edge of the Simpson Desert", 2011 and Wynne Prize finalist "Monaro Shadow and Light", 2015.
Early work.
Elisabeth Cummings worked part-time as an art teacher from 1969 to 2001 at multiple art colleges including the City Art Institute, Sydney (1975 to 1987) and the National Art School of Sydney. She continued painting independently during this time, winning awards such as the 1974 Grafton Prize and the 1977 Landscape and Still Life Prizes, RAS. Elisabeth Cummings has lived and worked at her Wedderburn studio residence since 1976.
Later work.
Elisabeth Cummings has been called ‘The Invisible Woman of Australian Art’ as she worked quietly and independently in her studio for 43 years with limited recognition. Cummings was unaffected by the lack of coverage of her work, stating "I like anonymity." She held her first Retrospective Exhibition "Elisabeth Cummings 65-96" at age 62 in Campbelltown Art Gallery, New South Wales. In 2012 Cummings exhibited her second Retrospective ‘Luminous: Survey Exhibition Landscapes of Elizabeth Cummings’ at the SH Ervin, Observatory Hill, Sydney. Now, Elisabeth Cumming’s works are a part of many major and regional Australian public collections including the National Gallery of Australia; the Art Gallery of New South Wales; The Queensland Art Gallery and Campbelltown Arts Centre, Sydney. In 2011 Elisabeth Cummings, at age 77, was awarded the Order of Australia Medal in recognition for her services to the visual arts in Australia. In 2018 Cummings was the subject of Noel Thurgate’s portrait "Elisabeth Cummings in her studio at Wedderburn, 1974 and 2018", which was a finalist for the 2018 Archibald Portraiture Prize.
Cummings is a frequent traveller and has participated in international and national artist residencies and exhibitions. In 2014, at age 81, participated in an artist residency and exhibition at The Nock Art Foundation in Hong Kong. In the same year Cummings, in a group of nine Australian artists, held a group exhibition at the Waiheke Arts Centre during their residency in Waiheke, New Zealand. Cummings was involved in the travelling exhibition "YOUR FRIEND THE ENEMY" along with fifteen Australian and New Zealand Artists. The artists were invited to Gallipoli, Turkey to paint the shores of Anzac Cove.
Printmaking.
In 2001 Cummings expanded into printmaking, specifically etching. She became involved in printmaking through a workshop with Michael Kempson at Cicada Press, a studio associated with UNSW Art &amp; Design in Sydney. Cummings participated in a program whereby artists print with the assistance of students. Other notable participants include Reg Mombassa and Euan Macleod. Cummings has since visited Cicada Press weekly to work with Kempson. Her print work explores similar concerns to her painting, primarily landscape and interiors. Cummings also created monoprints through Whaling Road Studios. The Cruthers Collection of Women's Art at the University of Western Australia hold three lithographs, "Studio", 1986, "Dappled bush", 1995 and "Windy bush", 1995"," and a silkscreen print "Billabong", 1999 by Cummings. In 2017 Cummings donated a comprehensive archival collection of 85 of her prints and etchings to the New England Regional Art Museum.
Ceramics.
Cummings has also explored ceramics and sculpture in the form of small-scale interior sets with figures crafted in clay. These were created together with Lino Alvarez. Cummings has also made small scale figurative sculptures out of bronze. In 2012 she collaborated with Louise Boscacci to make translucent porcelain plates and platters on which Cummings painted. The flat shape of the plates was chosen to reflect the salt encrusted clay pans of northern Queensland. The project "Cicada Waterfall" was named for the cicadas that can be heard in the bush at Cummings Wedderburn home. These pieces were exhibited in 2014 at King Street Gallery in Sydney as part of Cummings exhibition "Elisabeth Cummings: A Still Life".
Wedderburn.
In 1970, Cummings began camping in a tent on bushland land owned by Barbara and Nick Romalis at Wedderburn outside Sydney. Ten acres of land was gifted to Cummings by the Romalis to be used for the building of an art studio. Cummings was joined by artists Roy Jackson, Joan Brassil, and Fred Braat. The group then purchased another 15 acres from the Romalis and invited John Peart to join them in forming Widden Weddin. The move to Wedderburn coincided with a move towards gestural abstraction in her paintings, with Cummings privileging the painting process over the subject matter. Both Cummings and Peart have been involved in campaigns to protect the environment of Wedderburn from development. In 1994 Cummings small studio was destroyed by bushfires, along with significant amounts of work. Fellow long time resident John Peart died as the result of smoke inhalation as the result of a later fire in 2013. Following the 1994 fire, Cummings built a larger studio attached to her mud brick house on the land. Her 2001 painting "After the Fire, Wedderburn" depicts the aftermath of the fires.

Isorno

Isorno is a former municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. On 10 April 2016 the former municipalities of Vergeletto, Gresso, Mosogno and Isorno merged into the municipality of Onsernone.
The former municipality was created in 2001 by a merger of Auressio, Berzona and Loco.
History.
Auressio is first mentioned in 1233 as "Oraxio". Berzona is first mentioned in 1265 as "Berzona". Loco is first mentioned in 1224 as "Loco" and was also known as "Luogo".
Auressio.
Until the 19th century, the village had much closer ties to Piedmont than to the rest of the Onsernone valley. The construction of the road through the valley in the 19th century brought it closer to the rest of the valley.
The church of S. Antonio Abate was finished in 1526 and became the center of an independent parish in 1792 after it separated from Loco.
After World War II farming and grazing were almost abandoned and replaced by short-term, seasonal emigration. The improved transport links to the nearby town of Locarno increased Auressio's attractiveness as a place to live for those that were employed in Locarno. This led to a clear population increase in recent years.
One notable building in Auressio is the Villa Edera, which was built in 1887, for the Paris impresario Paolo Antonio Calzonio. It was restored in the early 1990s by the municipality and is now used as a hostel.
Berzona.
The village section of Seghelina is located directly on the main road, while the main village of Berzona is above the road. During the Middle Ages it was part of the "Squadra" of Onsernone.
The church of S. Defendente was built in 1564 and became a parish church when it separated from Loco in 1777. The section of Seghelina has the chapels of Santa Maria (1682) and S. Maria Lauretana (1766). The political municipality was created at the same time as the Canton of Ticino in 1803.
After World War II, much of the village population emigrated and sold their properties to outsiders. Many people who bought houses in Berzona were well known personalities from the arts and culture, such as Alfred Andersch, Golo Mann and Max Frisch. Today, the village is shrinking as few jobs in farming and grazing remain and most of the working population have moved to Locarno.
Loco.
Loco also contained the hamlets of Niva and Rossa.
From the Middle Ages until the end of the Ancien Régime Loco was the capital of the old Onsernone valley community. 
The parish church of San Remigio was the mother church of the valley and ancient seat of the Vicariate of Onsernone valley. It is first mentioned in 1228 (in the municipal archives), but is probably older. In the early 16th century it was rebuilt and acquired its current steeple. It houses the Holy Cross chapel with an ancient, venerated cross relic. The church is also the home of a Last Supper painting by the Flemish painter Godefridus Maes from 1683. In the hamlet of Niva, there is a late baroque chapel of St. John Nepomuk. The chapel in Sassello is from the late 17th century and is dedicated to the Madonna of Re.
In the 19th century, Loco was a center of the straw braiding for hats, bags and other articles. The straw braids that were used for this purpose were produced in the other villages of the Onsernone valley.
In addition to the typical houses with balconies, a number of aristocratic mansions are located in the village. These include the Casa Broggini (built 1708) in Rossa.
The primary school for the area is located in Loco, along with the Onsernonese Museum (opened 1966) and the renovated retirement home of the Onsernone valley. Near Loco, in a restored mill, there is a permanent exhibition on the grain milling in the area. Casa Shira (built in the 19th century, now owned by the community) has a small public library and a hostel.
At the beginning of the 21st century the majority of the workers commuted to Locarno.
Geography.
Isorno had an area, , of . Of this area, 8.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while 73.2% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 0.9% is settled (buildings or roads) and 17.5% is unproductive land.
The former municipality is located in the Locarno district, in the Onsernone valley along the Isone river. It consists of the villages of Auressio, Berzona and Loco.
Coat of arms.
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is "Per fess azure and vert a bar wavy argent and overall issuant from base three ribbons or interwoven ending in pall couped in chief." The new coat of arms symbolizes the merger, each thread of the twisted cord representing a former municipality.

Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane

The Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane is the Ordinary of the Scottish Episcopal Diocese of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane. The see is located at St Ninian's Cathedral in Perth, Scotland.
Following the Glorious Revolution, the Church of Scotland abolished the Episcopacy in 1689 and adopted a Presbyterian government. The Episcopalian remnant slowly formed the independent Scottish Episcopal Church. In the 19th century, the three dioceses were gradually merged to become the present Diocese of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane. The see is currently vacant; an electoral synod convened to elect the next bishop on 2 June 2018, electing Ian Paton. The previous bishop of the united diocese was the Right Reverend David Chillingworth.

George Soros

George Soros (born György Schwartz; August 12, 1930) is a Hungarian-American investor and philanthropist. , he has a net worth of US$7.2 billion, having donated more than $32 billion to the Open Society Foundations, of which $15 billion has already been distributed, representing 64% of his original fortune. In 2020, "Forbes" called Soros the "most generous giver" in terms of percentage of net worth.
Born in Budapest to a non-observant Jewish family, Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary and moved to the United Kingdom in 1947. He studied at the London School of Economics and was awarded a BSc in philosophy in 1951, and then a Master of Science degree, also in philosophy, in 1954. Soros started his career working in British and American merchant banks, before setting up his first hedge fund, Double Eagle, in 1969. Profits from this fund provided the seed money for Soros Fund Management, his second hedge fund, in 1970. Double Eagle was renamed Quantum Fund and was the principal firm Soros advised. At its founding, Quantum Fund had $12 million in assets under management, and it had $25 billion, the majority of Soros's overall net worth.
Soros is known as "The Man Who Broke the Bank of England" as a result of his short sale of worth of pounds sterling, which made him a profit of $1 billion, during the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis. Based on his early studies of philosophy, Soros formulated the general theory of reflexivity for capital markets, to provide insights into asset bubbles and fundamental/market value of securities, as well as value discrepancies used for shorting and swapping stocks.
Soros supports progressive and liberal political causes, to which he dispenses donations through the Open Society Foundations. Between 1979 and 2011, he donated more than $11 billion to various philanthropic causes; by 2017, his donations "on civil initiatives to reduce poverty and increase transparency, and on scholarships and universities around the world" totaled $12 billion. He influenced the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and provided one of Europe's largest higher education endowments to the Central European University in his Hungarian hometown. Soros's extensive funding of political causes has made him a "bugaboo of European nationalists". Numerous far-right theorists have promoted claims that characterize Soros as a dangerous "puppet master" behind alleged global plots. Criticisms of Soros, who is of Jewish descent, have often been called antisemitic conspiracy theories. In 2018, "The New York Times" reported that "conspiracy theories about him have gone mainstream, to nearly every corner of the Republican Party".
Early life and education.
György Schwartz was born on 12 August 1930 in Budapest in the Kingdom of Hungary to a prosperous non-observant Jewish family. Soros has wryly described his home as antisemitic. The family of his mother Erzsébet (also known as Elizabeth) operated a successful silk store. His father Tivadar (also known as Teodoro Ŝvarc) was a lawyer and a well-known Esperanto author who edited the Esperanto literary magazine "Literatura Mondo" and raised his son to speak the language. Tivadar had also been a prisoner of war during and after World War I until he escaped from Russia and rejoined his family in Budapest. 
Soros' parents married in 1924. In 1936, Soros's family changed their name from the German-Jewish "Schwartz" to "Soros", as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic Hungary. Tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning. In Hungarian, "soros" means "next"; in Esperanto it means "will soar".
Soros was 13 years old in March 1944 when Nazi Germany occupied Hungary. The Nazis barred Jewish children from attending school, and Soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the Judenrat ("Jewish Council"), which had been established during the occupation. Soros later described this time to writer Michael Lewis:
The Jewish Council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices. I was told to go to the Jewish Council. And there I was given these small slips of paper ... I took this piece of paper to my father. He instantly recognized it. This was a list of Hungarian Jewish lawyers. He said, "You deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported". I'm not sure to what extent he knew they were going to be gassed. I did what my father said.
Soros did not return to that job; his family survived the war by purchasing documents to say that they were Christians. Later that year at age 14, Soros posed as the Christian godson of an official of the collaborationist Hungarian government's Ministry of Agriculture, who himself had a Jewish wife in hiding. On one occasion, rather than leave the 14-year-old alone, the official took Soros with him while completing an inventory of a Jewish family's confiscated estate. Tivadar saved not only his immediate family, but also many other Hungarian Jews, and Soros later wrote that 1944 had been "the happiest [year] of his life", for it had given him the opportunity to witness his father's heroism. In 1945, Soros survived the Siege of Budapest, in which Soviet and German forces fought house-to-house through the city. George and his mother also spent some time hiding with the family of Elza Brandeisz and even attended their Lutheran church with them. When he was 17, Soros relocated to Paris before eventually moving to England. There he became a student at the London School of Economics. While a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter, and once received £40 from a Quaker charity. Soros would sometimes stand at Speakers' Corner lecturing about the virtues of internationalism in Esperanto, which he had learned from his father. Soros obtained his Bachelor of Science in philosophy in 1951 and a Master of Science in philosophy in 1954 from the London School of Economics. After graduating, he wanted to stay in the university and work as a professor, but his grades were not high enough, prompting him to work for an investment firm in London.
Financial career.
Early business experience.
In a discussion at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the "Los Angeles Times", asked Soros, "How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did you realize that you knew how to make money?". Soros replied, "Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. So, I wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank."
Singer and Friedlander.
In 1954, Soros began his financial career at the merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander of London. He worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department. A fellow employee, Robert Mayer, suggested he apply at his father's brokerage house, F.M. Mayer of New York.
F. M. Mayer.
In 1956, Soros moved to New York City, where he worked as an arbitrage trader for F. M. Mayer (1956–59). He specialized in European stocks, which were becoming popular with U.S. institutional investors following the formation of the Coal and Steel Community, which later became the Common Market.
Wertheim and Co..
In 1959, after three years at F. M. Mayer, Soros moved to Wertheim &amp; Co. He planned to stay for five years, enough time to save $500,000, after which he intended to return to England to study philosophy. He worked as an analyst of European securities until 1963.
During this period, Soros developed the theory of reflexivity to extend the ideas of his tutor at the London School of Economics, Karl Popper. Reflexivity posits that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants, not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation. Ideas and events influence each other in reflexive feedback loops. Soros argued that this process leads to markets having procyclical "virtuous" or "vicious" cycles of boom and bust, in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics.
Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder.
From 1963 to 1973, Soros's experience as a vice president at Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job; business was slack following the introduction of the Interest Equalization Tax, which undermined the viability of Soros's European trading. He spent the years from 1963 to 1966 with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation. In 1966, he started a fund with $100,000 of the firm's money to experiment with his trading strategies.
In 1969, Soros set up the Double Eagle hedge fund with $4m of investors' capital including $250,000 of his own money. It was based in Curaçao, Dutch Antilles. Double Eagle itself was an offshoot of Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder's First Eagle fund established by Soros and that firm's chairman Henry H. Arnhold in 1967.
In 1973, the Double Eagle Fund had $12 million and formed the basis of the Soros Fund. George Soros and Jim Rogers received returns on their share of capital and 20 percent of the profits each year.
Soros Fund Management.
In 1970, Soros founded Soros Fund Management and became its chairman. Among those who held senior positions there at various times were Jim Rogers, Stanley Druckenmiller, Mark Schwartz, Keith Anderson, and Soros's two sons.
In 1973, due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds, Soros resigned from the management of the Double Eagle Fund. He then established the Soros Fund and gave investors in the Double Eagle Fund the option of transferring to that or staying with Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder.
By the time it was renamed the Quantum Fund, the value of the fund had grown to $12m, only a small proportion of which was Soros's own money. He and Jim Rogers reinvested their returns from the fund, and also a large part of their 20% performance fees, thereby expanding their stake.
By 1981, the fund had grown to $400m, and then a 22% loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to $200m.
In July 2011, Soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors' money (valued at $1 billion) and instead invested funds from his $24.5 billion family fortune, due to changes in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rules, which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors. The fund had at that time averaged over 20% per year compound returns.
In 2013, the Quantum Fund made $5.5 billion, making it again the most successful hedge fund in history. Since its inception in 1973, the fund has generated $40 billion.
The fund announced in 2015 that it would inject $300 million to help finance the expansion of Fen Hotels, an Argentine hotel company. The funds will develop 5,000 rooms over the next three years throughout various Latin American countries.
Economic crisis in the 1990s and 2000s.
Soros had been building a huge short position in pounds sterling for months leading up to the Black Wednesday of September 1992. Soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the United Kingdom in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. For Soros, the rate at which the United Kingdom was brought into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was too high, their inflation was also much too high (triple the German rate), and British interest rates were hurting their asset prices.
By September 16, 1992, the day of Black Wednesday, Soros's fund had sold short more than $10 billion in pounds, profiting from the UK government's reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other European Exchange Rate Mechanism countries or float its currency.
Finally, the UK withdrew from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, devaluing the pound. Soros's profit on the bet was estimated at over $1 billion. He was dubbed "the man who broke the Bank of England". The estimated cost of Black Wednesday to the UK Treasury was £3.4 billion. Stanley Druckenmiller, who traded under Soros, originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated: "[Soros's] contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position".
On October 26, 1992, "The New York Times" quoted Soros as saying: "Our total position by Black Wednesday had to be worth almost $10 billion. We planned to sell more than that. In fact, when Norman Lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly $15 billion to defend sterling, we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell."
Soros was believed to have traded billions of Finnish markkas on February 5, 1996, in anticipation of selling them short. The markka had been put floating as a result of the early 1990s depression. The Bank of Finland and the Finnish Government commented at the time they believed that a "conspiracy" was impossible.
During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, accused Soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for welcoming Myanmar as a member. With a history of antisemitic remarks, Mahathir made specific reference to Soros's Jewish background ("It is a Jew who triggered the currency plunge") and implied Soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger Jewish conspiracy. Nine years later, in 2006, Mahathir met with Soros and afterward stated that he accepted that Soros had not been responsible for the crisis. In 1998's "The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered", Soros explained his role in the crisis as follows:
The financial crisis that originated in Thailand in 1997 was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity ... By the beginning of 1997, it was clear to Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.)Also during this time, Soros, through his Soros Quantum Fund attempted to sell short the Hong Kong dollar, using the similar strategies that he used during his bettings against the pound, baht, and peso. However, due in part to China's backing by maintaining a fixed exchange rate with the Hong Kong dollar, Hong Kong's currency remain more or less stable. Therefore, he lost most of the money shorted against the HKD.
In 1999, economist Paul Krugman was critical of Soros's effect on financial markets:
[N]obody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis, but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit. These new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name; my proposed term is "Soroi".
In an interview concerning the late-2000s recession, Soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the 1930s. According to Soros, market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been "some kind of an ideological excess". In Soros's view, the markets' moods—a "mood" of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimism/pessimism with which the markets look at reality—"actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially self-reinforcing but eventually unsustainable and self-defeating boom/bust sequences or bubbles".
In reaction to the Great Recession, he founded the Institute for New Economic Thinking in October 2009. This is a think tank composed of international economic, business, and financial experts, who are mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system.
Société Générale insider trading conviction.
In 1988, Soros was contacted by a French financier named Georges Pébereau, who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in Société Générale, a leading French bank that was part of a privatization program (something instituted by the new government under Jacques Chirac). Soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort, opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four French companies: Société Générale, as well as Suez, Paribas, and the Compagnie Générale d'Électricité.
In 1989, the (COB, the French stock exchange regulatory authority) conducted an investigation of whether Soros's transaction in Société Générale should be considered insider trading. Soros had received no information from the Société Générale and had no insider knowledge of the business, but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt. Initial investigations found Soros innocent, and no charges were brought forward. However, the case was reopened a few years later, and the French Supreme Court confirmed the conviction on June 14, 2006, although it reduced the penalty to €940,000.
Soros denied any wrongdoing, saying news of the takeover was public knowledge and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover. In December 2006, he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on various grounds, including that the 14-year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing. On the basis of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed, the court agreed to hear the appeal. In October 2011, the court rejected his appeal in a 4–3 decision, saying that Soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws.
Political involvement.
Until the 2004 presidential election, Soros had not been a large donor to U.S. political campaigns. According to OpenSecrets, during the 2003–2004 election cycle, Soros donated $23,581,000 to various 527 Groups (tax-exempt groups under the United States tax code, 26 U.S.C. § 527). The groups aimed to defeat President George W. Bush. After Bush's reelection, Soros and other donors backed a new political fundraising group called Democracy Alliance, which supports progressive causes and the formation of a stronger progressive infrastructure in America.
In August 2009, Soros donated $35 million to the state of New York to be earmarked for underprivileged children and given to parents who had benefit cards at the rate of $200 per child aged 3 through 17, with no limit as to the number of children that qualified. An additional $140 million was put into the fund by the state of New York from money they had received from the 2009 federal recovery act. Soros was an initial donor to the Center for American Progress, and he continues to support the organization through the Open Society Foundations.
In October 2011, a Reuters story, "Soros: not a funder of Wall Street Protests", was published after several commentators pointed out errors in an earlier Reuters story headlined "Who's Behind the Wall St. Protests?" with a lead stating that the Occupy Wall Street movement "may have benefited indirectly from the largesse of one of the world's richest men [Soros]". Reuters's follow-up article also reported a Soros spokesman and Adbusters' co-founder Kalle Lasn both saying that Adbusters—the reputed catalyst for the first Occupy Wall Street protests—had never received any contributions from Soros, contrary to Reuters's earlier story that reported that "indirect financial links" existed between the two as late as 2010.
On September 27, 2012, Soros announced that he was donating $1 million to the super PAC backing President Barack Obama's reelection Priorities USA Action. In October 2013, Soros donated $25,000 to Ready for Hillary, becoming a co-chairman of the super PAC's national finance committee. In June 2015, he donated $1 million to the Super PAC Priorities USA Action, which supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. He donated $6 million to the PAC in December 2015 and $2.5 million in August 2016. Soros launched a new super PAC called "Democracy PAC" for the 2020 election cycle. By July 2019, he had donated $5.1 million to it.
Since 2016, Soros has been donating sums exceeding $1 million to the campaigns of progressive criminal justice reform proponents through the "Safety and Justice" PAC in local district attorney elections. In many districts, such large contributions were unprecedented and the campaigning strategy was "turned on its head" with a focus on incarceration, police misconduct and bail system, according to the "Los Angeles Times". Larry Krasner was elected as the District Attorney of Philadelphia with the help of a $1.5 million ad campaign funded by Soros in 2017. Soros was the largest donor supporting the campaign of George Gascón for Los Angeles County District Attorney in 2020, contributing $2.25 million to superPACs in Gascón's favor. Soros gave $2 million to a PAC supporting Kim Foxx's campaign for Cook County State's Attorney in 2020.
In the second quarter of 2020, Soros gave at least $500,000 to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, becoming one of the campaign's largest donors.
For the 2022 United States elections, Soros was the country's largest donor. He donated $128.5 million to support the Democratic Party in the election cycle.
Central and Eastern Europe.
According to Waldemar A. Nielsen, an authority on American philanthropy, "[Soros] has undertaken... nothing less than to open up the once-closed communist societies of Eastern Europe to a free flow of ideas and scientific knowledge from the outside world". From 1979, as an advocate of 'open societies', Soros financially supported dissidents including Poland's Solidarity movement, Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia and Andrei Sakharov in the Soviet Union. In 1984, he founded his first Open Society Institute in Hungary with a budget of $3 million.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Soros's funding has played an important role in the newly independent countries. A 2017 study found that a grant program by George Soros which awarded funding to over 28,000 scientists in the former Soviet republics shortly after the end of the Soviet Union "more than doubled publications on the margin, significantly induced scientists to remain in the science sector, and had long-lasting [beneficial] impacts". His funding of pro-democratic programs in Georgia was considered by Georgian nationalists to be crucial to the success of the Rose Revolution, although Soros has said that his role has been "greatly exaggerated". Alexander Lomaia, secretary of the Georgian Security Council and former Minister of Education and Science, is a former executive director of the Open Society Georgia Foundation (Soros Foundation), overseeing a staff of 50 and a budget of $2.5 million.
Former Georgian foreign minister Salome Zourabichvili wrote that institutions like the Soros Foundation were the cradle of democratization and that all the NGOs that gravitated around the Soros Foundation undeniably carried the revolution. She opines that after the revolution the Soros Foundation and the NGOs were integrated into power.
Some Soros-backed pro-democracy initiatives have been banned in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Ercis Kurtulus, head of the Social Transparency Movement Association (TSHD) in Turkey, said in an interview 2006 that "Soros carried out his will in Ukraine and Georgia by using these NGOs ... Last year Russia passed a special law prohibiting NGOs from taking money from foreigners. I think this should be banned in Turkey as well." In 1997, Soros closed his foundation in Belarus after it was fined $3 million by the government for "tax and currency violations". According to "The New York Times" 1997, the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has been widely criticized in the West and in Russia for his efforts to control the Belarus Soros Foundation and other independent NGOs and to suppress civil and human rights. Soros called the fines part of a campaign to "destroy independent society".
In June 2009, Soros donated $100 million to Central Europe and Eastern Europe to counter the impact of the Great Recession on the poor, voluntary groups and non-government organizations.
Since 2012, the Hungarian Fidesz government has labelled George Soros as an enemy of the state. The government has disagreed with Soros's involvement in the 2015 European migrant crisis. The government has attacked OSF, the international civil support foundation created by George Soros, and tried to revoke the licence of Central European University (Budapest) (which failed mostly due to significant public outrage). In response, Soros called the government "a mafia state".
As the 2018 election period started, the government introduced public posters with a photo of Soros to create hostility in the general public towards him, using statements such as "Soros wants millions of migrants to live in Hungary", and "Soros wants to dismantle the border fence". The government also prepared a three-part law plan called the "Stop Soros package" (which followed other various law changes in the same year, hindering the workings of several international NGOs in Hungary), which would include various steps against NGOs doing volunteer work related to the refugee crisis.
In March 2017, six US senators sent a letter to then secretary of state Rex Tillerson asking that he look into several grants the State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) have given to groups funded by "left-wing" Soros. In the same context, the conservative group Judicial Watch has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the U.S. Department of State and USAID compelling them to release records regarding $5 million transferred from USAID to Soros's Open Society branch in Macedonia. The suit alleges that the money was deliberately used to destabilize the Macedonian government. The Open Society Foundation has said its activities in Macedonia were aimed at ethnic reconciliation with the Albanian minority and other forms of assistance since the collapse of Yugoslavia.
In January 2017, the "Stop Operation Soros" (SOS) initiative was launched in Macedonia. SOS seeks to present "questions and answers about the way Soros operates worldwide" and invites citizens to contribute to the research. In a press conference held during the same month, Nenad Mircevski, one of the founders of the initiative, stated that SOS would work towards the "de-Soros-ization" of Macedonia.
On May 16, 2018, Soros's Open Society Foundations announced they would move its office from Budapest to Berlin, blaming the move on an "increasingly repressive" environment in Hungary.
Africa.
The Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa is a Soros-affiliated organization.
Chile.
George Soros provided advice to the "No" campaign in the 1988 plebiscite, according to the magnate's friend Máximo Pacheco Matte. His support was reflected "in carrying out studies and obtaining data that gave us information that had been kept from us for 17 years (...) What we learned there was crucial for the preparation of the famous television program of the 'No' campaign and for the victory in the plebiscite."
He also sought to improve the image of then-candidate Ricardo Lagos in the 2000 presidential election among business circles.
In 2009, Michelle Bachelet awarded him the Bernardo O'Higgins Order of Merit as a gesture of gratitude for his "unwavering commitment to democracy and open societies."
Diplomacy.
Soros has helped fund the non-profit group Independent Diplomat, established by the former British diplomat Carne Ross.
Drug policy reform.
Soros has funded worldwide efforts to promote drug policy reform. In 2008, Soros donated $400,000 to help fund a successful ballot measure in Massachusetts known as the Massachusetts Sensible Marijuana Policy Initiative which decriminalized possession of less than of marijuana in the state. Soros has also funded similar measures in California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nevada and Maine. Among the drug decriminalization groups that have received funding from Soros are the Lindesmith Center and Drug Policy Foundation. Soros donated $1.4 million to publicity efforts to support California's Proposition 5 in 2008, a failed ballot measure that would have expanded drug rehabilitation programs as alternatives to prison for persons convicted of non-violent drug-related offenses.
In October 2010, Soros donated $1 million to support California's Proposition 19.
According to remarks in an interview in October 2009, it is Soros's opinion that marijuana is less addictive but not appropriate for use by children and students. He himself has not used marijuana for years. Soros has been a major financier of the Drug Policy Alliance – an organization that promotes cannabis legalization – with roughly $5 million in annual contributions from one of his foundations.
Death and dying.
The Project on Death in America, active from 1994 to 2003, was one of the Open Society Institute's projects, which sought to "understand and transform the culture and experience of dying and bereavement". In 1994, Soros delivered a speech in which he reported that he had offered to help his mother, a member of the right-to-die advocacy organization Hemlock Society, commit suicide. In the same speech, he also endorsed the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, proceeding to help fund its advertising campaign.
Conspiracy theories and threats.
Because of his Jewish identity, wealth, and philanthropy, Soros has been described as "the perfect code word" for conspiracy theories that unite antisemitism and Islamophobia. One prominent Soros-related conspiracy theory is that he is behind the 2015 European migrant crisis or importing migrants to European countries. The Hungarian government spent millions of dollars on a poster campaign demonizing Soros. According to anthropologist Ivan Kalmar, "Many of his most outspoken enemies inside and outside Hungary saw him as leading an international cabal that included other Jews such as the Rothschilds, as well as Freemasons and Illuminati".
Attempted assassination.
A pipe bomb was placed in the mailbox at Soros's home in Katonah, New York, on October 22, 2018, as part of the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts. The package was discovered by a caretaker, who removed it and notified authorities. It was photographed and exploded by the FBI, which launched an investigation. For several days afterward, similar bombs were mailed to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and other Democrats and liberals.
On October 26, 2018, Cesar Sayoc Jr. was arrested in Aventura, Florida, on suspicion of mailing the bombs. In August 2019, Sayoc was sentenced to 20 years in prison for mailing 16 pipe bombs to 13 victims. None of the devices exploded.
Political and economic views.
Reflexivity, financial markets, and economic theory.
Soros's writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity, where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions, potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy. Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a "near to equilibrium" or a "far from equilibrium" state. He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the "efficient market hypothesis") does not apply in these situations. Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions. He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect. Reflexivity is based on three main ideas:
A recent example (circa 2008) of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets. Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses. More people bought houses with this larger amount of money, thus increasing the prices of these houses. Lenders looked at their balance sheets, which not only showed that they had made more loans, but that the collaterals backing the loans – the value of the houses – had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing, relatively). Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good, and prices rose higher still.
This was further amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were guaranteed by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards.
The concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot. Soros's theories were originally dismissed by economists, but received more attention after the 2008 financial crisis, becoming the focus of an issue of the "Journal of Economic Methodology".
The notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of complexity economics, as developed at the Santa Fe Institute, although Soros had not publicized his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the 1980s.
Reflexivity in politics.
Although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that Soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets, he has also explored its effects in politics. He has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the "open society" in the past were from communism and fascism (as discussed in "The Open Society and Its Enemies" by his mentor Karl Popper), the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism.
He has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the United States is a reflexive phenomenon, insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable.
View of problems in the free market system.
Soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries. He blames many of the world's problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism.
Market predictions.
Soros's book "The New Paradigm for Financial Markets" (May 2008), described a "superbubble" that had built up over the past 25 years and was ready to collapse. This was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster. As he states:
He ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong:
In February 2009, Soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated, adding that there was no prospect of a near-term resolution to the crisis. "We witnessed the collapse of the financial system ... It was placed on life support, and it's still on life support. There's no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom."
In January 2016, at an economic forum in Sri Lanka, Soros predicted a financial crisis akin to the 2008 financial crisis based on the state of the global currency, stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking Chinese yuan.
Views on antisemitism and Israel.
When asked what he thought about Israel, in "The New Yorker", Soros replied: "I don't deny Jews the right to a national existence – but I don't want to be a part of it". According to hacked emails released in 2016, Soros's Open Society Foundation has a self-described objective of "challenging Israel's racist and anti-democratic policies" in international forums, in part by questioning Israel's reputation as a democracy. He has funded NGOs which have been actively critical of Israeli policies including groups that campaign for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel.
Speaking before a 2003 conference of the Jewish Funders Network, Soros said that the administrations of George W. Bush in the U.S. and Ariel Sharon in Israel, and even the unintended consequences of some of his own actions, were partially contributing to a new European antisemitism. Soros, citing accusations that he was one of the "Jewish financiers" who, in antisemitic terms, "ruled the world by proxy", suggested that, if the direction of those policies were changed, then anti-Semitism would diminish. Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League later said that Soros's comments held a simplistic view, were counterproductive, biased and a bigoted perception of the situation, and "blamed the victim" when holding Jews responsible for antisemitism. Jewish philanthropist Michael Steinhardt, who arranged for Soros's appearance at the conference, clarified that "George Soros does not think Jews should be hated any more than they deserve to be". Soros has also said that Jews can overcome antisemitism by "giv[ing] up on the tribalness".
In a subsequent article for "The New York Review of Books", Soros emphasized that:
I do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.
In 2017, Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz filed a $10-million lawsuit against Soros, alleging that Soros had influenced the government of Guinea to freeze Steinmetz's company BSG Resources out of iron ore mining contracts in the African country due to "long-standing animus toward the state of Israel". Steinmetz claims that Soros engaged in a "smear" campaign against him and his companies and blames Soros for scrutiny of him by American, Israeli, Swiss, and Guinean authorities. Soros called Steinmetz's suit "frivolous and entirely false" and said that it was "a desperate PR stunt meant to deflect attention from BSGR's mounting legal problems across multiple jurisdictions".
During an award ceremony for Imre Kertész, Soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming "perpetrators of violence", suggesting that this model explained Israel's behavior towards the Palestinians, which led to walkouts and Soros being booed.
In July 2017, a Hungarian billboard campaign backed by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, which was considered to be anti-semitic by the country's Jewish groups, vilified Soros as an enemy of the state, using the slogan "Let's not allow Soros to have the last laugh". The campaign was estimated to have cost 5.7bn forints (then US$21 million). According to the Israeli ambassador, the campaign "evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear", a reference to Hungary's role in the deportation of 500,000 Jews during the Holocaust. Lydia Gall of Human Rights Watch asserted that it was reminiscent of Nazi posters during the Second World War featuring "'the laughing Jew'". Orbán and his government's representative said they had a "zero tolerance" of antisemitism, explaining the posters were aiming to persuade voters that Soros was a "national security risk".
Hours later, in an apparent attempt to ally Israel with Hungary, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a "clarification", denouncing Soros, stating that he "continuously undermines Israel's democratically elected governments by funding organizations that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself".
Soros's son Alexander said in an interview that his father cares about Israel, and that he "would like to see Israel in Yitzhak Rabin's image. His views are more or less the common views in Meretz and in the Labor Party." According to Alexander, Soros supports a two-state solution. The younger Soros recounts that after his bar mitzvah in 1998, his father told him: "If you're serious about being Jewish, you might want to consider immigrating to Israel".
In a 2018 interview with "The New York Times", Alex Soros, the son of George Soros, when asked why his father fights for an open society, Soros replied that in a non-Jewish state, a Jew can only feel safe when other minorities are protected, which is one of the most important driving forces why his father has been active in his philanthropy:
But he had always "identified firstly as a Jew", and his philanthropy was ultimately an expression of his Jewish identity, in that he felt a solidarity with other minority groups and also because he recognized that a Jew could only truly be safe in a world in which all minorities were protected. Explaining his father's motives, he said, "The reason you fight for an open society is because that's the only society that you can live in, as a Jew—unless you become a nationalist and only fight for your own rights in your own state".
In December 2023, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, accused Soros of supporting pro-Palestinian organizations "that seek the destruction of the State of Israel as a Jewish state". Soros' son Alexander dismissed accusations of anti-Semitism as "distorted and dishonest right-wing attacks."
Views on the U.S..
On November 11, 2003, in an interview with "The Washington Post", Soros said that removing President George W. Bush from office was the "central focus of my life" and "a matter of life and death". He said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat Bush "if someone guaranteed it". Soros gave $3 million to the Center for American Progress, $2.5 million to MoveOn.org, and $20 million to America Coming Together. These groups worked to support Democrats in the 2004 election. On September 28, 2004, he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech, "Why We Must Not Re-elect President Bush", delivered at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. The online transcript of this speech received many views after Dick Cheney accidentally referred to FactCheck.org as "factcheck.com" in the vice presidential debate, causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to Soros's site.
His 2003 book, "The Bubble of American Supremacy","" was a forthright critique of the Bush administration's "War on Terror" as misconceived and counterproductive, and a polemic against the re-election of Bush. He explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the self-reinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices.
When Soros was asked in 2006 about his statement in "The Age of Fallibility" that "the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States", he responded that "it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world. And I think that's rather shocking for Americans to hear. The United States sets the agenda for the world. And the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda. By declaring a 'war on terror' after September 11, we set the wrong agenda for the world ... When you wage war, you inevitably create innocent victims."
In 2017, Soros described Donald Trump as a con man, and predicted Trump would fail because he believed Trump's ideas were self-contradictory. Soros also said he believed Trump was preparing for a trade war and expected financial markets to do poorly.
Views on Europe.
In October 2011, Soros drafted an open letter entitled "As concerned Europeans we urge Eurozone leaders to unite", in which he calls for a stronger economic government for Europe using federal means (Common EU treasury, common fiscal supervision, etc.) and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the Great Recession. The letter was co-signed by Javier Solana, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Andrew Duff, Emma Bonino, Massimo D'Alema, and Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga.
In October 2015, Soros criticized Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his handling of the 2015 European migrant crisis: "His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle."
Soros expected that Brexit would fail and the Premiership of Theresa May would last only a short time.&lt;ref name="Guardian20/01/2017"&gt;George Soros: Theresa May won't last and Donald Trump is 'would-be dictator' "The Guardian"&lt;/ref&gt; Soros is opposed to Brexit and donated £400,000 to the anti-Brexit 'Best for Britain' group. Soros also hosted a dinner for Conservative donors at his London home to encourage them to follow his lead. Soros's Open Society Foundations also donated a total of £303,000 to two pro-EU organizations, the European Movement UK and Scientists for EU, and a center-right think-tank, Bright Blue.
In 2018, Soros highlighted that Europe faces major challenges related to immigration, austerity, and nations leaving the EU. He holds that Europe is facing an existential crisis, in view of the rise of populism, the refugee crisis and a growing rift between Europe and the United States. Soros has also stated that "the euro has many unresolved problems" which "must not be allowed to destroy the European Union". He advocated replacing the notion of a multi-speed Europe by the aim of a "multi-track Europe" that would allow member states a wider variety of choices.
Views on relations between Europe and Africa.
In view of the possibility of a further increase of the number of refugees from Africa to Europe, Soros proposes that the European Union devise a "Marshall Plan for Africa" (see "Marshall Plan"), fostering education and employment in Africa in order to reduce emigration.
Views on China.
In 2010, Soros has expressed concern about the growth of Chinese economic and political power, saying, "China has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests ... They have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well". Regarding the political gridlock in America, he said, "Today, China has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the United States". In July 2015, Soros stated that a "strategic partnership between the US and China could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict". In January 2016, during an interview at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Soros stated that "[a] hard landing is practically unavoidable". Chinese state media responded by stating "Soros' challenge to the RMB and Hong Kong dollar are doomed to fail, without any doubt".
In January 2019, Soros used his annual speech at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, to label Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of China, as the "most dangerous opponent of open societies", saying: "China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it is the wealthiest, strongest and technologically most advanced". He also urged the United States not to allow the Chinese technology companies Huawei and ZTE to dominate the 5G telecommunications market as this would present an "unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world". Soros also criticized the newest form of China's Big Brother-like system of mass surveillance called the Social Credit System, saying it would give Xi "total control" over the people of China. Additionally, Soros is very critical of American companies that ignore Chinese human rights violations for business reasons, for example slamming BlackRock's decision to invest big in China as detrimental to worldwide democracy and US national security.
Views on Russia and Ukraine.
In May 2014, Soros told CNN's Fareed Zakaria: "I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent from Russia. And the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now."
In January 2015, he said that "Europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from Russia" and urged Western countries to expand economic sanctions against Russia for its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine.
In January 2015, Soros called on the European Union to give $50 billion of bailout money to Ukraine.
In July 2015, Soros stated that Putin's annexation of Crimea was a challenge to the "prevailing world order", specifically the European Union. He hypothesized that Putin wants to "destabilize all of Ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility, while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern Ukraine, which would then depend on Russia for economic support". In November 2015, Russia banned the Open Society Foundations (OSF) and the Open Society Institute (OSI)—two pro-democracy charities founded by Soros—stating they posed a "threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state". In January 2016, 53 books related to Soros's "Renewal of Humanitarian Education" program were withdrawn at the Vorkuta Mining and Economic College in the Komi Republic, with 427 additional books seized for shredding. A Russian intergovernmental letter released in December 2015 stated that Soros's charities were "forming a perverted perception of history and making ideological directives, alien to Russian ideology, popular". Most of these books were published with funds donated by Soros's charities.
In May 2022, Soros stated that the Russian invasion of Ukraine may be the start of "a third world war" and that Putin must be defeated "as soon as possible". He also stated that "Other issues that concern all of humanity—fighting pandemics and climate change, avoiding nuclear war, maintaining global institutions—have had to take a back seat to that struggle. That's why I say civilization may not survive."
Views on India and Narendra Modi.
In February 2023, Soros criticized Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his alleged Islamophobia, cronyism and authoritarianism, saying that "India is...a democracy. But its leader, Narendra Modi, is no democrat. Inciting violence against Muslims was an important factor in his meteoric rise." Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party accused Soros of trying to undermine Indian democracy. Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar claimed that Soros is a "dangerous" person. 
Wealth and philanthropy.
, "Forbes" magazine listed Soros as the 162nd richest person in the world, with a net worth of $8.3 billion. He has also donated 64% of his original fortune, of which more than $15 billion has been distributed through his Open Society Foundations (an international grant making network that supports advancing justice, education, public health and independent media). Forbes has called him the most generous giver (when measured as a percentage of net worth).
Soros has been active as a philanthropist since the 1970s, when he began providing funds to help Black students attend the University of Cape Town in apartheid South Africa, and began funding dissident movements behind the Iron Curtain.
Soros's philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote non-violent democratization in the post-communist states. These efforts, mostly in Central and Eastern Europe, occur primarily through the Open Society Foundations (originally Open Society Institute or OSI) and national Soros Foundations, which sometimes go under other names (such as the Stefan Batory Foundation in Poland). As of 2003, PBS estimated that he had given away a total of $4 billion. The OSI says it has spent about $500 million annually in recent years.
In 2003, former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker wrote in the foreword of Soros's book "The Alchemy of Finance":
George Soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator, wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game. The bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become "open societies", open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce but—more important—tolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior.
"Time" magazine in 2007 cited two specific projects—$100 million toward Internet infrastructure for regional Russian universities, and $50 million for the Millennium Promise to eradicate extreme poverty in Africa—noting that Soros had given $742 million to projects in the U.S., and given away a total of more than $7 billion.
Other notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern Europe, help to civilians during the siege of Sarajevo, and Transparency International. Soros also pledged an endowment of €420 million to the Central European University (CEU).
According to "National Review Online" the Open Society Institute gave $20,000 in September 2002 to the Defense Committee of Lynne Stewart, the lawyer who has defended controversial, poor, and often unpopular defendants in court and was sentenced to 2 years in prison for "providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy" via a press conference for a client. An OSI spokeswoman said "it appeared to us at that time that there was a right-to-counsel issue worthy of our support", but claimed later requests for support were declined.
In September 2006, Soros pledged $50 million to the Millennium Promise, led by economist Jeffrey Sachs to provide educational, agricultural, and medical aid to help villages in Africa enduring poverty. "The New York Times" termed this endeavor a "departure" for Soros whose philanthropic focus had been on fostering democracy and good government, but Soros noted that most poverty resulted from bad governance.
In May 2011, Soros donated $60 million to Bard College, establishing the Bard College Center for Civic Engagement.
Soros played a role in the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in Hungary (1984–89) and provided a substantial endowment to Central European University in Budapest. The Open Society Foundations has active programs in more than 60 countries around the world with total expenditures currently averaging approximately $600 million a year.
On October 17, 2017, it was announced that Soros had transferred $18 billion to the Open Society Foundations. In October 2018, Soros donated $2 million to the Wikimedia Foundation via the Wikimedia Endowment program.
In January 2020, Soros announced a $1 billion endowment donation at the World Economic Forum, establishing the Open Society University Network a global network of educational institutions in partnership with Bard College and the Central European University. Bard College president Leon Botstein serves as chancellor of the Open Society University Network.
In July 2020, Soros's Foundations announced plans to give $220 million in grants for racial justice groups, criminal justice reform and civic engagement.
In July 2020, Soros donated $100 million to Bard College, to strengthen and expand Bard's Center for Civic Engagement initiatives, and its leadership role as a founding partner of the Open Society University Network.
In April 2021, Soros pledged $500 million to the endowment of Bard College. The donation sits among the largest ever made to higher education in the United States. Following the $500 million donation Soros donated $25 million to the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College in August 2021, as well as an additional $25 million donation to Bard in September 2022.
Personal life.
Soros has been married three times and divorced twice. In 1960, he married Annaliese Witschak (born January 3, 1934). Annaliese was an ethnic German immigrant, who had been orphaned during the war. Although she was not Jewish, she was well-liked by Soros's parents, as she had also experienced the privation and displacement brought about by World War II. They divorced in 1983. They had three children:
In 1983, George Soros married Susan Weber. They divorced in 2005. They have two children:
As a child, Soros fantasized about being a God. In his book "Underwriting Democracy", he wrote, "If truth be known, I carried some rather potent messianic fantasies with me from childhood, which I felt I had to control, otherwise they might get me in trouble." He later elaborated on that passage in an interview saying, "It is a sort of disease when you consider yourself some kind of god, the creator of everything, but I feel comfortable about it now since I began to live it out."
In a 1998 interview with "CBS News", Soros said he was not religious and does not believe in God.
In 2008, Soros met Tamiko Bolton; they married on September 21, 2013. His older brother, Paul Soros, a private investor and philanthropist, died on June 15, 2013. , Soros owned homes on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, in The Hamptons on Long Island, and in Katonah, New York, within Westchester County.
In December 2023, Soros was swatted during a period of similar harassment targeting American political figures.
Honors and awards.
Soros has received honorary doctoral degrees from the New School for Social Research in New York, the University of Oxford in 1980, the Corvinus University of Budapest, and a Doctor of Humane Letters from Yale University in 1991. He received an honorary laurea degree in economics from the University of Bologna in 1995.
In 2005, Soros was a minority partner in a group that tried to buy the Washington Nationals, a Major League baseball team. Some Republican lawmakers suggested that they might move to revoke Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption if Soros bought the team. In 2008, Soros's name was associated with AS Roma, an Italian association football team, but the club was not sold. Soros was a financial backer of Washington Soccer L.P., the group that owned the operating rights to Major League Soccer club D.C. United when the league was founded in 1995, but the group lost these rights in 2000. On August 21, 2012, BBC reported SEC filings showing Soros acquired roughly a 2% stake in English football club Manchester United through the purchase of 3 million of the club's Class-A shares.
In 2008, Soros was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, Jack Nash, James Simons, Julian Roberston, Kenneth Griffin, Leon Levy, Louis Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Paul Tudor Jones, Seth Klarman, and Steven A. Cohen.
In January 2014, Soros was ranked number 1 in LCH Investments list of top 20 managers having posting gains of almost $42 billion since the launch of his Quantum Endowment Fund in 1973.
In July 2017, Soros was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy (HonFBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.
Soros was the "Financial Times" Person of the Year for 2018, with the "FT" describing him as "a standard bearer for liberal democracy, an idea under siege from populists".
In April 2019, Soros was awarded the Ridenhour Prize for Courage. In his acceptance address Soros said: "In my native Hungary, the government of [Prime Minister] Viktor Orbán has turned me into the super villain of an alleged plot to destroy the supposed Christian identity of the Hungarian nation... [I] donate the prize money associated with this award to the "Hungarian Spectrum", an online English-language publication that provides daily updates on Hungarian politics. It renders an important service by exposing to the world [in English] what Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is telling his own people [in Hungarian]. It ["Hungarian Spectrum"] deserves to be better known and supported."
In January 2025, United States President Joe Biden awarded Soros the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Lavertezzo

Lavertezzo is a municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
History.
Lavertezzo is first mentioned in 1327 as "Laverteze". In the Middle Ages, Lavertezzo was a "Squadra" of the "Vicinanza" of Verzasca. For centuries, the people lived in the summer months in the Verzasca valley and migrated in the winter, with their cattle, to the lower valleys. After the dissolution of Terricciole in 1920, a shared territory between Locarno, Minusio and Mergoscia, the settlement of Riazzino was allocated to Lavertezzo.
The parish church of Madonna degli Angeli was built in the 18th century. Lavertezzo became an independent parish in the 16th century, when it separated from Vogorno. It was granted a provost in 1806.
The double arch stone bridge was built in the 17th century and is one of the most distinctive sights in the village. The economy in the valley consisted mainly of farming and grazing. There was added income, from emigrants who went to Italy, especially Palermo. In 1873, they began to systematically produce granite from quarries in Lavertezzo.

Óscar González (Spanish footballer)

Óscar Javier González Marcos (; born 12 November 1982) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.
He appeared in 267 La Liga matches over nine seasons, totalling 40 goals for Valladolid (two spells) and Zaragoza. He also spent two years in Greece with Olympiacos.
Career.
Early career.
Born in Salamanca, Region of León, González began his career with Real Valladolid, making his first-team – and La Liga – debut in the 1–0 home win over UD Las Palmas on 7 October 2001, one month shy of his 19th birthday. Establishing himself as a regular by the start of the 2002–03 season, he was their best scorer in the following year at 10, in spite of a final relegation.
Zaragoza.
Subsequently, González moved to Real Zaragoza where he was a regular fixture throughout four seasons, whether as a starter or a substitute. His best scoring output came during his first season, with six goals (two being in a 2–2 draw at CA Osasuna).
Olympiacos.
After Zaragoza's relegation in 2007–08, González joined Olympiacos F.C. in the summer transfer window on a three-year deal, joining his compatriot Ernesto Valverde's roster. During his two-year spell, he totalled 68 games and netted nine times while providing five assists.
Helping the Piraeus side to the double in his debut campaign, González also scored in the UEFA Cup, in a 2–1 away loss against AS Saint-Étienne (5–2 aggregate loss) in the round of 32.
Return to Valladolid.
On 1 September 2010, Olympiacos parted ways with González, who signed a one-year contract with his first professional club Valladolid, now playing in the Segunda División. On 20 July 2011, he signed a two-year extension with the option of making his link a permanent one.
González scored 14 goals in the 2011–12 season, as the "Pucelanos" returned to the top flight after two years. Being deployed more often as a second striker in 2014–15, he bettered that total to 16 as the team again competed in the second tier.
After retiring, González owned a restaurant in Valladolid. In June 2024, he returned to his main club as youth coach.
Honours.

Losone

Losone is a municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
History.
The peat bogs of Arcegno, the rock shelters of Quarigo and the rock carvings in soapstone and gneiss appear to confirm that Losone has been inhabited since the Neolithic period. In 1934 and again in 1970–73 grave goods from the 1st to 4th centuries were found. There are also traces of a further use of the grave yard in the 6th century as well. The modern municipality of Losone is first mentioned in 1061 as "Loxono" though this is from a 1402 copy of the original. In 1200 it was mentioned as "de losono". During the Middle Ages the settlement or "borgo" included the so-called Bassa Losone, Arcegno and until 1807, Vosa im Onsernonetal. It formed a "Vicinanza" in the parish of Locarno and had its own statutes and laws. The status of an independent "Vicinanza" was confirmed in 1734. Losone owned rights to alpine pastures in the valleys of Bosco/Gurin, Onsernone and Vigezzo. The people paid to the nobles of Locarno a tithe on vineyards and grain. In 1799, Losone opposed the Helvetic authorities who wanted to create a political municipality. Even after it became a political municipality in 1803, the "Vicinanza" played an important political and economic role.
The parish church of S. Lorenzo is first mentioned in 1243, though it is older than that. It separated, some time before 1580, from the mother church of San Vittore in Muralto to form a parish. In 1747 the church was granted a rector.
The local economy traditionally relied on agriculture and quarries. During the Ancien Régime many of residents emigrated for jobs. Grinders, pewter workers and customs officers moved from Losone to Tuscany and Rome, while stove fitters and chocolate manufacturers went to Austria and Hungary. The construction of the bridge over the Maggia in 1815, the road to Ascona and Golino in 1824–25 and Maggia river correction in 1890, allowed development in the village. Beginning in the 20th century the parish house and school were built. Between 1941 and 1947, Polish and Ukrainian soldiers were interned in the district of Arbigo. The soldiers helped build the road from Arcegno to Golino. In 1949–50 a warehouse was converted into a barracks (infantry until 1973, then paramedics). The machine factory Agie opened in Losono in 1957, which contributed to the emergence of a major industrial area in the region. After 1960, Losone developed more and more into a residential community. In 1976, the new education center was dedicated. In 1982, a nursing home opened. Between 1940 and 1980 Losone recorded the strongest population growth of all of the municipalities in the Sopraceneri. More recently, tourism has developed including a golf course, that opened in 1999 in Gerre.

On 25 April 2010, the former municipalities of Caviano, Contone, Gerra Gambarogno, Indemini, Magadino, Piazzogna, San Nazzaro, Sant'Abbondio and Vira Gambarogno merged in the new municipality of Gambarogno.
History.
Magadino is first mentioned in 1254 as "de Magadino". It was also previously known, in German, as "Megadin" though this name is no longer used.
During the Late Middle Ages the village was mentioned when certain feudal rights were transferred from the Bishop of Como to the "Capitanei" of Locarno transferred. Until 1342, these rights included the right to collect tolls on goods traveling through the area. The village of Quartino was, in the 11th to 16th century, a Benedictine priory. The priory of St. George belonged to the abbey of S. Benigno di Fruttuaria in Piedmont, then to S. Gemolo di Ganna in Lombardy. In the 17th century the monastic estates came to the hospital in Locarno.
Together with the villages of Quartino and Orgnana, Magadino belonged to the parish of S. Pietro in Vira, until it became an independent parish in 1846. The church of San Carlo was built in 1844–46.
The Codice "delle strade di Como" (1335) mentions a tower in Magadino, though no trace of the tower has been found. A castle is also mentioned in a chronicle from the 17th century, but it is also lost. The chronicle says it was built in 1365 on the orders of Galeazzo Visconti for the inhabitants of Locarno and destroyed in 1518 by the Swiss.
Magadino was a major port and an important customs station at the transit route north from Lombardy to the cities of the Alps, and its importance grew in 1515 after the collapse of the bridge over the Ticino river at Bellinzona. With the introduction of regular steamship traffic (1826) and the opening of the road over the Gotthard Pass (1830) Magadino became a stop on the coach routes. Many new warehouses, hotels and restaurants were built, some of which are still visible today. The decline of the port began with the opening of the railway lines to Locarno (1874) and Luino (1882). The town stagnated between the 1880s until the 1960s. In 2000, the majority of the population worked outside the village. In 2005, almost half of the jobs were in the services sector.
