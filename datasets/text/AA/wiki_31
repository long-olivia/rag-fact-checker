RAF Leiston

Royal Air Force Leiston or more simply RAF Leiston is a former Royal Air Force station located northwest of Leiston and south of Theberton, Suffolk, England.
History.
USAAF use.
Originally intended as a fighter station for RAF Fighter Command, RAF Leiston airfield (actually located in Theberton) was allocated to the Eighth Air Force of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) on 22 September 1942 and designated Station 373 (LI).
The airfield was constructed to Class A airfield standards between September 1942 and September 1943 by John Mowlem and Company Ltd. and first occupied by the USAAF in October 1943. Leiston's proximity to the coast meant that the airfield was used on many occasions by battle-damaged aircraft returning from operations over Europe. The first aircraft to land on the airfield - while it was still under construction - are believed to have been two Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses which were returning from operations on 30 July 1943. One aircraft nearly hit a contractor's vehicle when coming in to land as some of the runways were still partly obstructed by tree stumps and other materials.
The three runways were concrete overlaid with asphalt, with 62 aircraft dispersals (38 concrete pans and 12 twin pens with blast walls) situated along its perimeter track. The USAAF added 17 PSP parking squares and a walled 6-plane revetment for additional aircraft parking. Support structures included two T-2 hangars (each in dimension) and 12 corrugated steel wide Over Blister hangars dispersed on all sides of the perimeter track. The ten living sites located west of the airfield had a capacity for 1,709 personnel.
358th Fighter Group.
The 358th Fighter Group arrived at Leiston from RAF Goxhill on 29 November 1943 after completing training. The group was assigned to the 66th Fighter Wing of the VIII Fighter Command. Aircraft of the group were identified by yellow cowlings.
The group consisted of the following squadrons:
The 358th FG began operations on 20 December 1943 and engaged in escort work until April 1944 to cover the operations of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress/Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers that the USAAF sent against targets on the Continent. On 31 January 1944 the group relocated to RAF Raydon near Ipswich and became part of the Ninth Air Force, which in turn transferred the North American P-51 Mustang-equipped 357th Fighter Group from Raydon to the Eighth Air Force.
357th Fighter Group.
The 357th Fighter Group, arrived at Leiston from RAF Raydon on 31 January 1944, replacing the P-47-equipped 358th Fighter Group in the 66th Fighter Wing, VIII Fighter Command. After March 1944 aircraft of the group were identified by red-yellow-red rings on the propeller spinner and a 12" red and yellow band around the forward part of the nose in the checkerboard pattern of the 66th Fighter Wing groups.
The group consisted of the following squadrons:
The 357th FG served as an escort group, providing penetration, target, and withdrawal support for bombers that attacked strategic objectives on the Continent and began operations in the assault against the Luftwaffe and aircraft industry during Big Week, 20–25 February 1944.
The group received a Distinguished Unit Citation for two escort missions in which heavy opposition was encountered from enemy fighters: on 6 March 1944 provided target and withdrawal support during the first attack that heavy bombers of Eighth AF made on Berlin. On 29 June 1944 the group protected bombers that struck targets at Leipzig. The unit received second DUC for operations on 14 January 1945 when the group, covering 3rd Division B-17's on a raid to synthetic oil plants at Derben broke up an attack by a large force of interceptors and in the ensuing aerial battle destroyed 56.5 German fighters (later credited as 55.5), the largest number of claims by any Eighth Air Force group on a single mission.
In addition to escort the 357th conducted counter-air patrols, made fighter sweeps, and flew strafing and dive-bombing missions in which it attacked airfields, marshalling yards, locomotives, bridges, barges, tugboats, highways, vehicles, fuel dumps, and other targets. It participated in the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, the breakthrough at Saint-Lô in July, the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944–January 1945, and the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945.
The group flew its last mission, an escort operation, on 25 April 1945 and moved to Neubiberg, Germany on 21 July and was assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe for duty with the army of occupation.
357th FG aces Chuck Yeager (the man who broke the sound barrier) and Bud Anderson were stationed in Leiston. 
Cpt. James Browning, an ace assigned to the 363rd FS, was also stationed here until his death over the Fulda Gap in 1945.
Postwar use.
After the Americans departed for occupation duty, Leiston was returned to the RAF on 10 October 1945 and until 1953 it was known as No. 18 Recruit Centre, RAF Technical Training Command. With the closure of the recruit centre Leiston was placed into care and maintenance status, then closed for good in 1955. Parts of the airfield were sold during the late 1950s and 60s, with the last pieces being returned to the public in 1965.
Current use.
Today Leiston airfield is virtually unrecognisable. The airfield area itself, has largely been returned to agriculture except for the Cakes &amp; Ale Park, about 1/3 of the main runway and a short section of perimeter track further down Harrow Lane. The NW runway still exists in its full length but has been reduced to a width of about and cannot be viewed from public roads.
A few old buildings still exist on the airfield and also on a domestic site but most are overgrown with vegetation and are in poor condition.

1388 Aphrodite

1388 Aphrodite ("prov. designation": ) is an asteroid of the Eos family from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 24 September 1935, by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Uccle. The likely elongated K-type asteroid has a rotation period of 11.9 hours. It was named after the Greek goddess Aphrodite from Greek mythology.
Orbit and classification.
"Aphrodite" is a core member of the Eos family (), the largest asteroid family in the outer main belt consisting of nearly 10,000 asteroids. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.3 AU once every 5 years and 3 months (1,916 days; semi-major axis of 3.02 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 11° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Johannesburg Observatory in September 1939, just four nights after its official discovery observation at Uccle.
Naming.
This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, beauty, and sexuality, and daughter of Zeus and the Titaness Dione. The asteroid's name was proposed by the German Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (). The official was mentioned in "The Names of the Minor Planets" by Paul Herget in 1955 ().
Physical characteristics.
While the asteroid's spectral type is unknown, "Aphrodite", with a geometric albedo of around 0.15 "(see asteroid-family list)", is likely a K-type asteroid, which is typically associated with members of the Eos family.
Rotation period and poles.
In May 2007, a rotational lightcurve of "Aphrodite" was obtained from photometric observations by Julian Oey at the Kingsgrove Observatory in Australia in collaboration with other observatories. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours and a brightness variation of 0.65 magnitude (), indicative for an elongated, non-spherical shape. Alternative period determinations by Alvaro Alvarez-Candal (9 h; Δ 0.4 mag) in 2004, René Roy (11.88 h; Δ 0.34 mag) in 2006, and Kevin Ivarsen (11.95 h; Δ 0.35 mag) in 2003, received a lower rating ().
A modeled lightcurve using photometry obtained from public databases and through a large collaboration network as well as sparse-in-time individual measurements from a few sky surveys was published in 2016 and 2018. Most recent results gave a concurring sidereal period of hours, as well as two spin axes at (325.0°, 35.0°) and (137.0°, 66.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β).
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, "Aphrodite" measures between 21.4 and 25.2 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.13 and 0.18. The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" derives an albedo of 0.1217 and a diameter of 25.17 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.9.

Professional career.
Seattle Mariners.
2006.
In his first professional season in he split time between Arizona League Mariners appearing in seven games and Single-A Inland Empire 66ers appearing in one game of the California League. He posted an 0–2 record overall with a 2.25 ERA in 16 innings striking out 17 batters and starting five games. He pitched three hitless innings for Inland Empire during his brief time there.
2007.
Morrow was invited to spring training in . He went 0–1 with a 1.08 ERA in 6 relief appearances and made the major league club despite being considered a long-shot to make the club at the start of spring.
Morrow made his Major League debut on April 3 against the Oakland Athletics, pitching one scoreless inning.
Morrow went 3–4, with a 4.12 ERA in 60 appearances striking out 66 batters and walking 50. He held opposing hitters to a .243 batting average, including .221 against right-handed batters. He set a club rookie record with 18 holds, breaking old record of 13 set by Ed Vande Berg in . Morrow had the fourth most appearances by a rookie reliever in club history with 60 and fifth most strikeouts with 66. Among American League rookie relievers Morrow ranked second in strikeouts, third in appearances and fourth in ERA.
On April 23, he earned his first major league win against the Texas Rangers, allowing one hit in career-high three and one third innings pitched. He recorded 18 and two thirds consecutive scoreless innings from April 20 to June 8. During the streak he went 2–0 while holding opposing batters to a .103 average. He also recorded another scoreless streak of 17 innings pitched over 15 outings from July 17 to August 24. Morrow held opponents scoreless in 44 of 60 outings.
2008.
After missing two weeks of spring training in 2008 due to a sore shoulder, Morrow was optioned to the Mariners minor league affiliate Double-A West Tennessee on March 30. Morrow was recalled to the Seattle bullpen 17 days afterwards when Mariners starter Érik Bédard was placed on the 15-day disabled list. When Seattle's regular closer J. J. Putz became injured on June 12, Morrow took over his duties. Including a closing appearance on June 11, Morrow saved 8 games in 8 tries, before a July 10 opportunity when he gave up two solo home runs to the Oakland Athletics to acquire his first blown save. He had only given up 2 runs all year prior to that, and had 40 strikeouts in 36.2 innings pitched, and a very low ERA of 1.76 and WHIP of 0.88.
On August 5, Morrow was optioned to Triple-A to become a starting pitcher.
Morrow made his first MLB start on September 5, against the New York Yankees. Morrow went 7 no-hit innings in his first major league start and was 4 outs away to being just the second player to throw a no-hitter in their MLB starting debut only to see pinch hitter Wilson Betemit end his bid. The Mariners went on to win the game 3–1, giving Morrow his first win as a starter.
2009.
On March 29, the Mariners announced that Morrow would no longer be used as a starting pitcher; instead, he would move into a relief role with the organization. Morrow, who has Type 1 diabetes, acknowledged that his diabetes was a factor in the decision, saying that it was easier to balance his blood sugar in a relief position.
Morrow began the season as the closer and earned five saves through the end of April. However, he was placed on the disabled list on May 2 after he developed right biceps tendinitis. David Aardsma served as closer in his absence.
After coming off the disabled list Morrow returned to the starting rotation, making six starts before being optioned to the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers to develop back into a more rounded starting pitcher.
On August 14, Morrow pitched a four hit shutout against the Iowa Cubs. During that game Morrow struck out two, walked one and threw 59 of 96 pitches for strikes. Morrow retired 10 straight batters early in the game.
Morrow won his fifth consecutive decision for Tacoma tossing five scoreless innings to lead the Rainiers to a 4–1 win over the Portland Beavers on August 29. Morrow was removed from the game because of stiffness in his arm.
On September 9, Morrow was called up to the Mariners. He was to start at least one game, so manager Don Wakamatsu could assess Morrow's progress. On September 30, Morrow gave up one hit and walked two hitters in 8 shutout innings against the Oakland Athletics. The Mariners won the game 7–0.
Toronto Blue Jays.
On December 22, 2009, the Mariners traded Morrow to the Toronto Blue Jays for pitcher Brandon League and minor league outfielder Johermyn Chávez.
2010.
Morrow's first season in Toronto was the first of his major league career as a full-time member of a starting rotation. Toronto's coaching staff altered Morrow's delivery in a similar fashion to the way Roy Halladay's delivery was altered during his first years with the Blue Jays. The switch from an over-the-top arm motion to a lower-angle arm slot was believed to have contributed to an increased command of his pitches. He was also encouraged to reduce his pitch velocity and try to induce weak contact, again much in the same way Halladay was taught during his tenure in Toronto. Despite some struggles with inconsistency during the early stages of the alterations, statistics show that his production stabilized as the season progressed and he managed to produce favorable results on a regular basis before the end of the season, including a stellar 17 strikeout, one hit performance that was a candidate for MLB.com's This Year in Baseball Performance of the Year.
On August 8, Morrow was one out away from a no-hitter against the Tampa Bay Rays when Evan Longoria hit an infield single. It would have been the first no-hitter by a Blue Jay since Dave Stieb's no-hitter on September 2, 1990. He finished the one-hitter for his first complete game while compiling 17 strikeouts, a career high for Morrow in a game and one strikeout shy of the team record of 18 strikeouts set by Roger Clemens in 1998. According to the Game Score metric devised by sabremetrician Bill James, this tied for the fourth-highest rated nine-inning pitching performance since 1920, with a game score of 100.
On August 29, the Blue Jays announced that after his next start, Morrow would be shut down for the season to protect his arm. He pitched more innings in 2010 () than in any of his previous seasons. He finished the season with a 10–7 record, 4.49 ERA, and 178 strikeouts. Morrow was nominated as one of 2010's "Ten People Making a Difference in Diabetes".
2011.
Morrow, who was expected to be the Jays' No. 2 starter in the pitching rotation, began the season on the 15-day disabled list with right forearm inflammation. He made his regular-season debut on April 23 against the Tampa Bay Rays, pitching innings, giving up 3 hits, 2 runs, 2 walks and 10 strikeouts.
For the first time since being traded, Morrow returned to Seattle to face the Mariners on August 17. Morrow recorded the win, pitching 6 innings and striking out 12 batters.
Morrow became the first pitcher in major league history to pitch 100 innings in one season without the team recording a double play behind him. On September 23, after innings dating back to August 28, 2010, Desmond Jennings of the Tampa Bay Rays grounded into Morrow's first double play in 30 starts. It would end up being Morrow's only double play induced in the season, but also the only double play Jennings would ground into all season. Morrow finished the season with an 11–11 record, 4.79 ERA, and 203 strikeouts. He led the league with 10.2 strikeouts per 9 innings.
2012.
On May 3, in a game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Morrow threw a three-hit complete-game shutout. The following night, teammate Henderson Álvarez also threw a complete-game shutout. Morrow and Álvarez thus became the first Blue Jays starters to throw back-to-back shutouts since Jack Morris and Al Leiter did so on June 16 and 17, 1993. Morrow established a career high in complete games and shutouts (with 2 each) on May 19, throwing a three-hit shutout against the New York Mets. He improved that mark on June 6 against the Chicago White Sox, throwing a complete game two-hit shutout. His third shutout of the season gave him the league lead at the time.
Morrow experienced "stabbing pain" during the first inning of his June 11 start while pitching to Bryce Harper, the second hitter in the Washington Nationals lineup. After delivering three pitches to Harper, Morrow left the game with a strain of the left oblique muscles. Morrow returned from the 60-day disabled list on August 25. In innings, he finished the season with a 10–7 record, 2.96 ERA, and 103 strikeouts.
2013.
On February 5, 2013, manager John Gibbons named Morrow the number 2 starter for the upcoming season, behind reigning NL Cy Young Award winner R. A. Dickey. After opening the season with a 2–3 record and a 5.63 earned run average, Morrow was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 1 with a right forearm strain. He made his first rehab start at High-A Dunedin on June 17, and pitched just 2 innings. On June 18, it was announced that Morrow had been pulled from rehabilitation after suffering an unnamed setback during his start. An MRI that day revealed only inflammation, and no structural damage in Morrow's arm.
On July 24, it was reported by Rogers Sportsnet that Morrow was diagnosed with an entrapped radial nerve in his right forearm, and would likely miss the rest of the 2013 season. Blue Jays management said the following day that they expected Morrow to pitch again in 2013, either in late September or in October's instructional league in Florida. Manager John Gibbons later said on August 22 that Morrow would remain on the disabled list for the rest of the season. In 2013, Morrow posted a record of 2–3, a 5.63 earned run average, and 41 strikeouts over just 54 innings pitched.
2014.
Morrow struggled throughout early spring training, giving up 7 earned runs through just 8 innings pitched. On March 18, manager John Gibbons confirmed that Morrow would be the team's fifth starter, citing a need to give him more time to prepare for the regular season. After struggling to open the season, including a start on April 26 where he walked 8 Red Sox batters over 2 innings, Morrow was placed on the 15-day disabled list on May 3 with a sprained right index finger. Later that day his injury was determined to be a more severe torn tendon sheath in his right hand, and he was transferred to the 60-day DL. Morrow made his first rehab appearance on August 27 with the Dunedin Blue Jays, pitching one scoreless inning. He was activated from the 60-day DL and added to the Blue Jays active roster on September 1, 2014. On November 1, the Blue Jays declined Morrow's $10 million 2015 option, making him a free agent.
San Diego Padres.
On December 16, 2014, Morrow signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the San Diego Padres. He made 5 starts with the Padres in 2015, posting a 2.73 ERA and 23 strikeouts, before going on the disabled list with right shoulder inflammation in early May. He remained on the disabled list into August, when it was determined that he required season-ending surgery to correct a shoulder impingement. On December 17, Morrow signed a minor league contract with the Padres that included an invitation to spring training.
Los Angeles Dodgers.
On January 25, 2017, Morrow signed a minor-league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers that included an invitation to major league spring training. He did not make the major league team and was assigned to the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers to begin the season. Morrow was called up by the Dodgers on May 29, due to a clause in his contract that would have forced the Dodgers to waive him if he wasn't called up. By the end of the season, Morrow had settled into a role as the Dodgers' setup man. In 45 appearances out of the Dodgers bullpen, he was 6–0 with a 2.06 ERA with 50 strikeouts and two saves.
Morrow allowed one run in 3 innings in the 2017 NLDS, zero runs in 4 innings in the 2017 NLCS and five runs in 5 innings in the 2017 World Series. He was only the second person in history to pitch in all seven games of a World Series, Darold Knowles having done so in 1973.
Chicago Cubs.
On December 12, 2017, Morrow signed a two-year, $21-million contract with the Chicago Cubs.
On June 20, 2018, Morrow was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to back tightness.
On August 21, 2019, he was shut down for the season due to lingering problems in his elbow. On November 4, 2019, Morrow elected free agency. On December 14, 2019, Morrow re-signed with the Cubs on a minor league deal.
The Cubs organization released Morrow on July 8, 2020.
Los Angeles Dodgers (second stint).
On December 11, 2020, Morrow signed a minor league contract to return to the Los Angeles Dodgers organization. However, he struggled with his rehab and did not pitch for the Dodgers at any level during the 2021 season. Morrow elected free agency following the season on November 7, 2021.
Pitching style.
Morrow threw a hard fastball which sat between 92 and 100 mph. He had the ability to throw several off-speed pitches, including a slider (85–89 mph), curveball (81–85 mph), and change-up (81–87 mph). In September 2011, Morrow debuted a new cut fastball which came from making a slight adjustment on his slider, with velocity hovering around 88–91 mph.
Personal life.
Morrow is tall and weighs . He is married. His favorite pitcher growing up was Pedro Martínez.
Morrow was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes his senior year of high school. He wears an insulin pump to regulate his blood sugar levels.

Leela Roy

Leela Roy (; 2 October 1900 – 11 June 1970) was a leftist Indian woman politician and reformer, and a close associate of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. She was born in Goalpara, Assam to Girish Chandra Nag, who was a deputy magistrate, and her mother was Kunjalata Nag. She was the first female student of Dhaka University.
Family.
She was born into an upper middle class Bengali Kayastha family in Goalpara district of Bengal Province and educated at the Bethune College in Calcutta, graduating in 1917. She stood first among the girls and was awarded the 'Padmabati Gold Medal' along with a cash price of Rs. 100 on 2 October 1917 by the department of English. Her father was Girischandra Nag. He was the tutor of Subhas Chandra Bose. She fought with university authorities and became the first woman to be admitted to the University of Dhaka and earned her M.A. degree. Co-education was not permitted in Dhaka University. The then Vice Chancellor Philip Hartog gave a special permission for her admission.
Social work.
She threw herself into social work and education for girls, starting the second girls school in Dhaka. She encouraged girls learning skills and receiving vocational training and emphasized the need for girls to learn martial arts to defend themselves. Over the years, she set up a number of schools and institutes for women.
She contacted Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose when he was leading the relief action after the 1921 Bengal floods. Leela Nag, then a student of the Dhaka University, was instrumental in forming the Dhaka Women's Committee and, in that capacity, raised donations and relief goods to help Netaji.
In 1931, she began publishing the Jayasree Patrika, the first magazine edited, managed, and wholly contributed by women writers. It received the blessings of many eminent personalities including Rabindranath Tagore, who suggested its name.
Political activity.
Leela Nag formed a rebellion organization in December 1923 called Deepali Sangha ("Dipali Sangha") in Dhaka where combat training were given. Pritilata Waddedar took courses from there. She took part in the Civil Disobedience Movement and was imprisoned for six years. In 1938, she was nominated by Congress President, Subhas Chandra Bose to the National Planning Committee of the Congress. In 1939 she married Anil Roy. On Bose's resignation from the Congress, the couple joined him in the Forward Bloc. In 1941, when there was a serious outburst of communal rioting in Dhaka, she along with Sarat Chandra Bose formed the Unity Board and National Service Brigade. In 1942, during the Quit India Movement both she and her husband were arrested and her magazine was forced to cease. On her release in 1946, she was elected to the Constituent Assembly of India.
During the partition violence, she met Gandhi in Noakhali. Even before Gandhiji reached there, she opened a relief center and rescued 400 women after touring on foot 90 miles in just six days. After the Partition of India, she ran homes in Calcutta for destitute and abandoned women and tried to help refugees from East Bengal. From 1946 to 1947, Roy set up seventeen relief camps in Noakhali, following the riots which took place there - activist Suhasini Das worked at one.

The Tribune (San Luis Obispo)

The Tribune is a semiweekly broadsheet newspaper and news website that covers San Luis Obispo County, California.
History.
It was created in 1939 from a combination of three newspapers founded between 1869 and 1905, and was later acquired by the E. W. Scripps Company.
Walter Murray led the establishment of "The Tribune" in the late 1860s, starting as the publication's editor and co-owner, with the first issue being printed on August 7, 1869. By 1886, the newspaper was produced above the Chicago Brewery Depot housed at the corner of Chorro and Monterey streets. In April 1939, it merged with the "Telegram", an anti-saloon newspaper in town, becoming the "Telegram-Tribune". The publication later moved from 1240 Morro Street to 1321 Johnson Avenue beginning in 1958, operating there for the next 35 years, before relocating once more to a new building, at 3825 S. Higuera Street, in 1993.
Scripps traded the paper, along with "The Monterey County Herald", to Knight Ridder in 1997, in exchange for the "Boulder Daily Camera". The McClatchy Company took over the paper on June 27, 2006, when it acquired Knight Ridder, formerly the United States' second-largest chain of daily newspapers.
"The Tribune" owns one weekly newspaper, "The Cambrian," located in Cambria, California. A second weekly newspaper, "The Sun Bulletin" of Morro Bay, no longer publishes. According to McClatchy, the newspaper's daily circulation is 35,080 as of 2015.
In February 2015, the paper's publisher, Bruce Ray, announced his resignation; "Fresno Bee" president and publisher Tom Cullinan was named publisher for the paper. In late 2015, along with many other McClatchy newspapers, "The Tribune" went through a redesign, adopting a companywide design style for both print and online platforms. Ken Riddick was named president and publisher of "The Tribune" in October 2017. "The Tribune"'s longtime executive editor Sandra Duerr retired in December 2017.
On February 13, 2020, the paper announced that its owner, The McClatchy Company, had declared bankruptcy. In an article by Kevin G. Hall, McClatchy claimed that bankruptcy was necessary in order to "... shed costs of print legacy and speed shift to digital." Court filings revealed a plan that would turn over control to hedge fund management company, Chatham Asset Management. The family-held company would have to give up its shares in McClatchy, which according to a press release, operates 31 newspapers from Miami to Sacramento, California. No information was given about potential layoffs at that time.
Effective June 5, 2023, the paper's daily print edition will arrive via the U.S. Mail instead of delivery by a local carrier. In February 2024, the paper announced it will decrease the number of print editions to two a week.

Étang de Berre

The Étang de Berre (, "Lagoon of Berre"; in Provençal Occitan: "estanh de Bèrra / mar de Bèrra" according to classical orthography, "estang de Berro / mar de Berro" according to Mistralian orthography) is a brackish water lagoon on the Mediterranean coast of France, about north-west of Marseille.
Geography.
The lagoon covers an area of . Created by the rise in water levels at the end of the Last Glacial Period (colloquially known as the last ice age), this small inland sea is composed of three parts: the principal body of water, the "Étang de Vaïne" to the east and the "Étang de Bolmon" to the south-east.
The Étang de Berre is fed with fresh water by the rivers Arc, Touloubre and Cadière and – since 1966 – by Électricité de France's . Two canals link it to the Mediterranean, the open air leading towards Port-de-Bouc and the Canal de Marseille au Rhône which leads towards L'Estaque through the Rove Tunnel; the Rove Tunnel has been closed since 1963, after a section of the tunnel collapsed.
The Marseille Provence Airport is located in the southeast portion of the Étang de Berre, with its main runway extending into the water on reclaimed land.
Administration.
Ten communes border the Étang de Berre: Istres, Miramas, Saint-Chamas, Berre-l'Étang, Rognac, Vitrolles, Marignane, Châteauneuf-les-Martigues, Martigues and Saint-Mitre-les-Remparts.
History.
The ancient name of the Étang de Berre was "Stagnum Mastromela", according to Pliny the Elder (Book III [34]).

Heroes and Villains (Only Fools and Horses)

"Heroes and Villains" is the thirteenth Christmas special episode of the BBC sitcom "Only Fools and Horses", first broadcast on 25 December 1996 as the first part of the 1996 Christmas trilogy. It attracted a UK television audience of 21.3 million, at the time a record for the show. In the episode, Del and Rodney are invited to a fancy dress party. They arrive dressed as Batman and Robin.
Synopsis.
The episode opens with Rodney in a dystopian nightmare, in which Damien, head of the now multinational "Trotters Independent Traders", apparently rules the Western world in the year 2026, forcing President Keanu Reeves to declare war on China, claiming that "war is good". Del Boy (who is now Lord of Peckham) and Raquel live in a lavish high-rise building, "Trotter Towers", but Rodney himself is merely an old messenger, Cassandra is a maid (after Damien took over her bank and fired her), and Uncle Albert's body has been preserved (all he can say is his trademark phrase "During the war..." on a constant loop).
Rodney wakes up back in the present day on his birthday, on which he receives an identity bracelet from Del with the name "Rooney". Del's application for a council grant has been rejected, and Raquel receives a letter from her estranged parents, who want to meet her again. It emerges that Rodney and Cassandra have been trying for a baby, which leads to an unsuspecting Uncle Albert drinking one of Cassandra's urine samples, believing it to be apple juice. Meanwhile, at Sid's café, Trigger is telling everyone about a medal he received from the local council for using the same broom for twenty years, despite the fact that it has actually had 17 new heads and 14 new handles in that time. Del buys tickets for himself and Rodney to attend a publican's fancy dress birthday party, Cassandra goes to Spain with her mother, and Raquel and Damien visit her parents.
At Del's request, he and Rodney go to the party dressed as Batman and Robin respectively, but their Reliant Regal van breaks down halfway there and they have to run the rest of the way. En route they interrupt an attempt to mug Councillor Murray, emerging from the fog in their Batman and Robin costumes, which scares away the thugs. Del and Rodney arrive at the party, unaware that the publican, Harry Malcolm, had in fact died the day before and the fancy dress has thus been cancelled in favour of a wake (a fact that Boycie, who met them in the doorway, "forgot" to mention), and they burst into the main room humming the "Batman" theme tune.
Del and Rodney are in the market the next day and see the gang of thieves again, this time robbing an elderly woman. Rodney gives chase, before one of the muggers then starts chasing him; Del eventually knocks the mugger unconscious with his suitcase. Del (though not Rodney, much to his frustration) receives a medal for apprehending the gang. While at the awards ceremony, he meets Councillor Murray again, who offers to do him a favour in return for saving her. That night Del announces that his application for a council grant has now been approved, and Rodney reveals that Cassandra is pregnant.
Popular culture.
The Batman and Robin scene from the episode was partially re-created by actors during the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.
The scene in which Trigger maintains he has kept the same broom for twenty years despite having so many new heads and handles, has since become an idiom in the UK for the Ship of Theseus paradox.

Dixie Crystal Theatre

The Dixie Crystal Theatre (also known as the Clewiston Theater) is a historic site in Clewiston, Hendry County, Florida. It is located at 100 East Sugarland Highway. It first opened in 1941. In 1998, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
It is a flat-roofed one-story masonry movie theater, built in a simplified Moderne style – one of the few buildings in the area to feature this type of architecture. In 1940, the building was commissioned by Mary Hayes Davis, a newspaper publisher and businesswoman who operated a chain of movie theaters in south Florida and the Lake Okeechobee region. It was her second theater in Clewiston with that name. Davis had opened the first Dixie Crystal Theatre at the corner of Sugarland Highway and Central Avenue in 1934. The theaters got their name from the local sugar industry product.
The architect of the new Dixie Crystal Theatre was Chester A. Cone of West Palm Beach and Palm Beach, who also designed the Prince Theatre in Pahokee. The builder and contractor was Earl Anderson. It is in plan.
The Clewiston Theater was integrated peacefully on July 20, 1964, when five African American youths attended an evening show there for the first time. A Hendry County sheriff's deputy and a Clewiston policeman were present for the duration of the film.
The theater closed briefly in 2011, but soon reopened, featuring live bands, first-run movies, and independent films. By early 2015, the Clewiston Theater had closed. As of 2023, the theatre has been converted into a dentist office.

Clay Bryant

Claiborne Henry Bryant (November 16, 1911 – April 9, 1999) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball who played from 1935 through 1940 for the Chicago Cubs. Listed at , , Bryant batted and threw right handed. He was born in Madison Heights, Virginia.
Career.
Bryant spent parts of six seasons in the Minor Leagues before joining the Cubs in 1935. His most productive season came in 1938, when he won 19 games with a 3.10 earned run average and led the National League with 135 strikeouts, while pitching seven consecutive complete games, winning six of them in the first 25 days in September, to help the Cubs erase a nine-game deficit and capture an unlikely pennant.
Bryant went 32–20 with a 3.73 ERA in parts of six seasons for the Cubs. He began to experience elbow and shoulder pain, and this led to his retirement from baseball in 1940.
Bryant was an exceptionally good hitting pitcher in his six-year major league career, posting a .266 batting average (51-for-192), scoring 48 runs, with 5 home runs and 28 RBI.
Afterwards, Bryant was a longtime manager in the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers minor league system, and also served as a pitching coach for the Dodgers in 1961 and the Cleveland Indians in 1967 and 1974. He also was a roving pitching instructor in the Cleveland organization. Ned Garver said he learned the fundamentals of pitching from Bryant when he managed the Newark Moundsmen.
Bryant managed winter ball for the Leones del Caracas club of the Venezuelan League, guiding his team to the 1956–1957 pennant while advancing to the 1957 Caribbean Series.
Bryant died in 1999 in Boca Raton, Florida, at the age of 87.

Kerry Tramway

The Kerry Tramway was a narrow gauge railway built in 1887 to serve the timber workings and slab quarry to the south of the village of Kerry, near Newtown in mid Wales.
Route.
The railway ran from the Cambrian Railways Kerry railway station at Glanmule to the Brynllywarch estate owned by Christopher Naylor. The line served the timber forests on the estate, as well as a slab quarry and general estate traffic. It was worked by the Bagnall locomotive "Excelsior".
Closure.
In 1895 Naylor inherited Haggerston Castle and left Brynllywarch; the rolling stock of the railway was sold and the track was lifted.
Reopening.
During the First World War there was a great demand for timber. In 1917 the government Timber Supply Department (which later became the Forestry Commission) relaid much of the tramway to serve the sawmill on the estate. The railway and timber felling operations were mainly manned by German prisoners of war under military control. During the war, the line was worked by the Kerr Stuart locomotive Diana. After hostilities ceased the tramway continued to operate. In early 1919 a petrol locomotive arrived from Baguely and in 1922 a third locomotive, the Haig class "Kashmir" arrived.
Final closure.
The line closed again in 1922 and all the tracks lifted except the Lower Rhos to Pentre section. This last remaining section was worked using an unknown 0-4-0 side tank locomotive for several more years.

Veterans Memorial Parkway

The Veterans Memorial Parkway (VMP, known as "Veterans" by locals) is a 13.4 km (8.3 mi) limited-access and municipally maintained parkway located entirely within London, Ontario. The parkway was previously the provincial King's Highway 100 from 1977 until 1993, and was formerly named Airport Road from 1977 to September 2006. It begins in the south at Wilton Grove Road and ends at Clarke Road, which it continues as northward.
Airport Road was built by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, predecessor to the modern Ministry of Transportation (MTO) in the late 1970s to connect Highway 401 with London International Airport. It was widened to four lanes in 2005 and renamed as the Veterans Memorial Parkway in 2006. Extensions south and north were completed in 2017 and 2020, respectively. Long term plans for the route call for grade separated interchanges along its entire length to convert it to a freeway.
Route description.
The Veterans Memorial Parkway is a 13.4 km (8.3 mi) expressway located within London, Ontario. The parkway begins at Wilton Grove Road, immediately south of Highway401, and travels north to Clarke Road, which it continues as northwards.
The parkway begins as a two-lane expressway that progresses northward through farm fields for before crossing over Highway401 at a partial cloverleaf interchange (Exit194). It widens to four lanes north of the interchange and travels through empty fields, with several new industrial developments dotting the landscape, including a Dr. Oetker pizza factory.
It intersects Bradley Avenue and Hamilton Road before crossing the South Thames River.
The Veterans Memorial Parkway curves slightly northwest as it intersects River Road and enters suburban London. It passes under the Canadian National Railway (CN) Dundas subdivision before intersecting Gore Road. Now surrounded by commercial developments, it intersects Tartan Drive and Trafalgar Street. It curves north, with subdivisions now bordering its western side, before intersecting Admiral Drive and later Dundas Street. The parkway swerves lightly east and crosses the CP rail Galt Subdivision.
Now within a light industrial area, the route intersects Page Street and Oxford Street East before curving northwest and crossing Pottersburg Creek.
The parkway meets the CN Strathroy Subdivision at an at-grade crossing before intersecting Huron Street. Returning to undeveloped land, the route swerves northwest before intersecting and becoming Clarke Road.
History.
London endured a long debate about in-city freeway connections through the city and west to Sarnia, through the 1960s. Repeated debates moved the links into and out of the city limits, and considered numerous options that either cut through existing neighbourhoods or were routed further out from the city center. One proposed road would connect to Highway 401 in the south and join up with Highway 402 in the west. This plan, however, never came to fruition due to city council's reluctance to fund an urban freeway. When city council became more united in opposition to Highway 402 being routed through London, the highway now known as Veterans Memorial Parkway was conceived by the Ontario government as a compromise: a spur highway that would run along the eastern parts of London. 
The City of London and the province decided that the proposed road would be constructed as a two-lane highway from Highway 401 north to Oxford Street. Designed as a super two, the design included a right-of-way so that an additional carriageway could be built in the future. As well, the road would be designated as Highway100 and named Airport Road. The road featured traffic lights at intersections, with available right-of-way to build interchanges if warranted. Construction on Airport Road began in early 1975, with its official opening in 1977.
The London–Middlesex Act, passed December10, 1992, expanded the municipal boundaries of the City of London effective January1, 1993.
Consequently, the Ministry of Transportation transferred responsibility for Highway100 to the city several months later on June24.
In 1998, the road was extended further north from Oxford to Huron Street.
On April17, 2003, funding was announced as part of a joint venture between the City of London, the Government of Ontario, and the Government of Canada, to widen Airport Road from Highway401 to Oxford Street. Construction began in 2004, using the right-of-way to construct another carriageway separated by a grass median.
The completion of the project resulted in a four-lane, divided highway with at-grade intersections but sufficient room for future interchanges and overpasses, similar to that of the Hanlon Expressway. The widening was completed in 2005.
On October25, 2005, the London city council voted in favour of renaming Airport Road as the Veterans Memorial Parkway as a tribute to Canadian veterans.
This name change ceremoniously took place on September15, 2006.
The state of the parkway quickly drew the ire of locals and veterans, with one remarking that the weeds and litter were an "insult".
A C$1.5 million proposal for beautification, designed by local architect Ron Koudys, called for the planting of flowers within the median, and shrubs and trees along the outskirts of the road. However, due to lack of funding, it took until 2010 for the project to begin.
It included a large gateway monument which was installed on the northbound lanes near the Highway 401 interchange, greeting motorists entering the expressway,
planting trees along the entire length of the expressway,
and raising flagpoles in tribute to Canadian veterans.
As part of an effort to create new industrial parks, London city council approved a proposal to extend the parkway south to Wilton Grove Road on April5, 2011.
The proposed extension included the reconstruction of the existing trumpet interchange with Highway401 into a partial cloverleaf.
Construction began on the extension in September 2016. The C$23.5 million project was completed on November10, 2017.
A northern extension, north and west from Huron Street to Clarke Road, was proposed in 2007.
On March11, 2020, construction began on the C$12 million extension, including a realignment of the entrance to the Fanshawe conservation area as well as Clarke Road.
It opened to traffic in late 2020.
Future.
Widening the road between Oxford Street and Huron Street / Robin's Hill Road is in the City of London short term transportation objectives.
The City of London conducted a long-term transportation corridor protection study in 2001 and noted that the Veterans Memorial Parkway (then Airport Road) would serve as the city's eastern expressway when the city reaches its projected full build-out potential.
In 2007, the City of London conducted an environmental assessment on potential interchange locations to be built along Veterans Memorial Parkway.
Long-term plans have called for Veterans Memorial Parkway to be included as the eastern leg of a future London Ring Road. These proposals have been discussed since the 1960s but have yet to gain traction due to the requirement of land outside the cities boundaries.
The eastern corridor for a ring road would use Veterans Memorial Parkway in the east, then continue north along Clarke Road. A western link would start at Highway 402 and head north between Westdel Bourne Road and Woodhull Road.
The northern corridor is a major stumbling block since the lands needed within the city limits have been developed. The only available route possible would be outside of the city in Middlesex Centre. Although talks continue between both municipalities, only the province can approve the plan.

Mozingo Lake

Mozingo Lake is a 1,006-acre (4.07 km²) reservoir located in eastern Nodaway County, approximately 5 miles east of Maryville. Constructed in the early 1990s, the lake serves as the primary drinking water source for the city of Maryville and anchors the 3,000-acre Mozingo Lake Recreation Park, a regional destination for outdoor recreation and tourism.
History.
Construction of Mozingo Lake began in 1991 and was completed in 1992 by damming Mozingo Creek, a perennial stream that originates near the Iowa border. The lake filled rapidly due to heavy rainfall and briefly overtopped its dam during the Great Flood of 1993. Initial fish stocking began in 1993 with bluegill and channel catfish, followed by largemouth bass in 1994 and walleye in 1996.
Ecology.
Mozingo Lake is considered a eutrophic reservoir, with elevated levels of nutrients and phytoplankton biomass. These conditions have led to periodic harmful algal blooms (HABs), particularly during summer months. In 2020, the lake was listed on Missouri’s 303(d) list of impaired waters due to high levels of chlorophyll-a, nitrogen, and cyanobacteria. The lake also experiences taste and odor issues in drinking water due to geosmin, a compound produced by cyanobacteria.
Despite these challenges, the lake supports a diverse fishery managed by the Missouri Department of Conservation. Common species include largemouth bass, walleye, bluegill, channel catfish, and black crappie.
Hydrology.
Mozingo Lake is part of the Mozingo Creek watershed, which drains into the One Hundred and Two River. The lake is approximately 4.2 miles long, with an average depth of 10.5 feet and a maximum depth of 50 feet. The watershed is predominantly agricultural, with 39% pastureland and 37% cropland, contributing to nutrient and sediment runoff into the lake.
Recreation.
The surrounding 3,000-acre Mozingo Lake Recreation Park is owned and operated by the City of Maryville. Amenities include RV and tent camping, eight rustic cabins, a public beach, equestrian and hiking trails, disc golf, and the Mozingo Event Center, which hosts weddings, conferences, and regional events.
Golf.
Mozingo Lake is home to the Mozingo Lake Golf Course, which includes the 18-hole Sechrest Course and the 9-hole Watson Course. The Sechrest 18 was designed by Donald Sechrest and features over 7,100 yards of championship-level play. The Watson 9, named after Missouri native Tom Watson, offers a shorter, family-friendly layout.
Events.
Mozingo Lake Recreation Park hosts a variety of public events throughout the year, including fishing tournaments, triathlons, fireworks displays, and seasonal festivals. The official events calendar provides up-to-date listings of upcoming activities.

Port Royal Experiment

The Port Royal Experiment was a program begun during the American Civil War in which former slaves successfully worked on the land abandoned by planters. They were given the chance to be paid wages and this was a good test for the reconstruction era that was coming before the war even ended. Freed men even bought land for themselves and Northern missionaries and abolitionists came to teach the freed men. 
History.
In 1861 the Union captured the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina and their main harbor, Port Royal. The white residents fled, leaving behind 10,000 black slaves. Several private Northern charity organizations stepped in to help the former slaves become self-sufficient. The result was a model of what Reconstruction could have been. The African Americans demonstrated their ability to work the land efficiently and live independently of white control. They assigned themselves daily tasks for cotton growing and spent their extra time cultivating their own crops, fishing and hunting. By selling their surplus crops, the locals acquired small amounts of property. But it wasn't specifically meant to be a way to envision the future of America but rather a way to stray away from slavery while Reconstruction went on.
Among the Northerners who arrived as teachers were Mary Lambert Allen and her husband William Francis Allen from West Newton, Massachusetts. Detailed descriptions of their daily life are provided in his diaries, which have been transcribed. Admiration for the hard work ethic of the former slaves is mentioned, as well as the urgent need for a basic education of which they had been deprived. Allen also took notes on the language, songs and music he heard which he later published. In 1862, General Ormsby M. Mitchel helped African Americans to found the town of Mitchelville on Hilton Head Island. The Port Royal Experiment ended up beginning to make northerner whites nervous as some felt like it could be too much work having to maybe compensate for their injustice in slavery and they made them really uneasy. They went from supporting it fully into becoming more and more worried as they saw it progress. But after the death of Abraham Lincoln and the election of President Andrew Johnson, the experiment came to an abrupt end in 1865, returning the land to its previous white owners.
In February 1862, a report was made to the Treasury Dept. which gives an indication of the territory held in the Port Royal Experiment:
An estimate of the number of plantations open to cultivation, and of the persons upon the territory protected by the forces of the United States, if only approximate to the truth, may prove convenient in providing a proper system of administration. The following islands are thus protected, and the estimated number of plantations upon each is given:
Or about two hundred in all.
There are several other islands thus protected, without plantations, as Otter, Pritchard, Fripp, Hunting and Phillips. Lemon and Daw have not been explored by the agents engaged in collecting cotton. The populous island of North Edisto, lying in the direction of Charleston, and giving the name to the finest cotton, is still visited by the rebels. A part near Botany Bay Island is commanded by the guns of one of our war vessels, under which a colony of one thousand negroes sought protection, where they have been temporarily subsisted from its stores. The number has within a few days been stated to have increased to 2300.
In the summer of 1862, Union troops protecting coastal colonies began to withdraw to reinforce Union General George B. McClellan who was engaged in the Peninsula Campaign, a series of battle between March and July. Many of the colonies were consolidated. One example was the migration of camps at Edisto Island to St. Helena Island.
Education.
A special education commission was established by Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase. E. L. Pierce was the Government Agent overseeing the experiment. The committee was looking for teachers to be sent to educate the former slaves, including as to how to govern themselves in normal society. The teachers were also responsible for intellectual, moral, and religious instruction. The Boston Educational Commission for Freedmen was established in response to a call made by E. L. Pierce as a philanthropic organization. Around the same time, the Port Royal Relief Committee of Philadelphia was formed. A New York organization united with the Boston organizations to provide relief and education for the former slaves. Many more relief organizations were established from different parts of the country. Hundreds of teachers were sent to different parts of the South.
In March 1862, more than 150 candidates applied for the special position to the special education commission, and 35 candidates were initially chosen. One of the candidates was prominent educator from Ohio John Celivergos Zachos with whom Salmon P. Chase was familiar as senator and governor of Ohio.
John Celivergos Zachos and Susan Walker traveled to Port Royal from Ohio. The Boston and New York Education Commissions sent Zachos to prove that the former slaves could be educated. Zachos was on Parris Island in March 1862, in command of 400 freed slaves on a plantation. He spent 16 months at Parris Island, taking on many roles, including army surgeon, teacher, and storekeeper. He was also in charge of the military stronghold under General Rufus Saxton.
Zachos tried to teach the former slaves and studied their ability to learn. The professor realized that older slaves had a hard time because of the years of psychological abuse and torture. Zachos found it easier to educate the younger slaves. Towards the end of 1863, Zachos traveled back to Boston. In early 1864, Zachos assembled a group of Irish and German uneducated immigrants, both male and female. The test subjects did not speak or read English.
Zachos assembled a curriculum to instruct the test subjects based on the needs of the former slaves and their ability to learn. Early on, the professor did not have a book and so was forced to use charts and the chalkboard. The pupils had to wait until March 1864 to receive the first book, "The Phonic Primer and Reader".
The experiment concluded that the technique created during his time at Port Royal was effective enough to teach adults. It was a simple method that used a unique phonic teaching method of teaching English reading by the sounds of letters. The research was presented to the Boston and New York Education Commissions and published in the "Journal of The Massachusetts Teachers Association". The same year, an official book was published to educate the former adult slaves, "The Phonic Primer and Reader". After his work, Salmon P. Chase gave Zachos an extraordinary recommendation.
The Port Royal Experiment initiated a systematic outcry for the education of the freed slaves. A massive number of organizations were established and continued educating the freed people. On March 3, 1865, roughly two months before the end of the Civil War, the Freedmen's Bureau was established. Within the next five years, it had established 4239 schools, employed 9307 teachers, and instructed 247,333 students. The higher education of African Americans was the bureau's responsibility. In many instances there was opposition among the white people of the South; moreover, in one state, the opposition became widely organized. At the same time, many former slave masters reportedly assisted in establishing schools for the slaves and became their teachers.
On May 16, 1866, a convention was held in Cleveland, Ohio, and formed the American Freedman's Union Commission. The Boston Educational Commission became the New England Branch, and the New York National Freedmen's Relief Association became the New York Branch. Many other such philanthropic organizations also merged into different branches of the American Freedman's Union Commission with the intention of the proliferation of the education of African-Americans.

Larry French

Lawrence Herbert French (November 1, 1907 – February 9, 1987) was an American starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1929–1934), Chicago Cubs (1935–1941), and Brooklyn Dodgers (1941–1942). A knuckleball specialist, French threw left-handed and batted right-handed.
Baseball career.
French was born in Visalia, California, in 1907. From 1926 to 1928, he played for the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League. He then joined the National League's Pittsburgh Pirates and was a workhorse for them, pitching over 260 innings every year from 1930 to 1934.
The Pirates then traded French to the Chicago Cubs. He played for the Cubs from 1935 to 1941. He led the NL in shutouts in 1935, with four, and in 1936, with four again. French won at least 10 games every season from 1930 to 1940.
After a poor start in 1941, French joined the Brooklyn Dodgers and played for them through the 1942 season before leaving professional baseball.
In a 14-year major league career, French had a 197–171 record with a 3.44 earned run average and 1,187 strikeouts in 3,152 innings pitched, including 40 shutouts and 198 complete games. He had at least 10 starts and 6 games in relief in all 14 seasons of his career. As a hitter, French posted a .188 batting average (199-for-1057) with 1 home run, 83 runs scored, 84 runs batted in, and 48 bases on balls in 570 games. Defensively, he recorded a .951 fielding percentage. French played in the 1935, 1938, and 1941 World Series, which were all losing efforts.
One author described French as the best pitcher not in the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Shower game.
With his team leading the Boston Braves 8–0 in the ninth inning during their game on July 12, 1933, reliever French figured he could duck out of the bullpen and hit the showers early. Little did he know as he was getting clean that the Braves had rallied to make the score 8–7. When the call came for French to pitch, he did not even have time to rinse off. He put on his uniform and hustled out to the mound with soap trickling down his neck.
Later life.
French joined the United States Navy after the 1942 baseball season and became a career sailor, serving in both World War II and the Korean War. He retired in 1969 with the rank of Captain, having been awarded the Legion of Merit.
French died in San Diego, California, in 1987 at age 79.

Johnny Appleseed (film)

The Legend of Johnny Appleseed is an animated short musical segment from Walt Disney's 1948 film "Melody Time". It is narrated by Dennis Day and is based on the American frontiersman John Chapman, better known as Johnny Appleseed. It is also included on the 2002 direct to video, VHS, and DVD release of "Disney's American Legends".
Plot.
In 1806, Pittsburgh farmer Johnny Appleseed watched as pioneers depart out west and wishes that he could follow, but doesn’t know how to survive in the unknown wild. Johnny is inspired by an angel to abandon his farm, go west, and plant apple seeds everywhere he goes so that settlers will always have something to eat during their travels. The angel tells Johnny that he has all that he needs to go out West: a bag of apple seeds for planting, a holy book known as the Bible, and a tin pot he can use for a hat. In one of his travels, Johnny befriends a skunk, and thereafter, all animals instinctively trust him. As Johnny travels, he uses his pot to fry in, and sings a tune "The Lord Is Good to Me".
In the end, after walking hundreds of miles and planting apple trees all along the way, Johnny finally rests for the last time under a tree; his angel appears before him, and tells Johnny that it is time to go. Johnny's spirit gets up, scared at first upon realizing he is dead and is reluctant to go to his final resting place, believing that his work is not done yet. However, the angel tells him that, where they are headed, they are low on apple trees, so Johnny picks up his seed bag and happily agrees to go with him.
The narrator finishes by saying that he always thinks of Johnny Appleseed whenever he looks up because the clouds in the sky are not really clouds at all: "They're apple blossoms, if you please, from John's heavenly orchard of apple trees".
Theatrical release.
The film was originally a sequence in "Melody Time", released May 27, 1948, then reissued as a stand-alone short on Christmas of 1955 and later reissued again by Buena Vista Distribution in 1967 as part of Disney's Cartoon Special.
Home media.
The short was included on the DVD releases of "Disney's American Legends", on February 12, 2002; Volume 3 of "Walt Disney's It's a Small World of Fun!" in February 2007; and Volume 6 of "Walt Disney Animation Collection: Classic Short Films" on May 12, 2009.

Operation Argon

Operation Argon (sometimes denoted simply as "Operation Cabinda") was an unsuccessful military operation carried out by South African special forces in May 1985 with the objective of destroying six fuel storage tanks at Malongo in Angola's Cabinda exclave.
Background.
On 13 May 1985 a modified South African Navy Daphne submarine carrying a nine-man Recce team, as well as a back-up team, left Saldanha Bay and travelled to a spot some way off the Angolan coast near its border with Zaire. The area contained oil storage installations run by the Angolans and Gulf Oil, and because of this, several large military bases were also placed in the vicinity.
The team had to travel by sea, and then by land, distances that were too far to travel in one night. They therefore had to spend a night ashore, and planned a ruse to make it appear that they had infiltrated from the East from Zaire, rather than from the sea.
Infiltration.
The Recces landed on the coast at night on 20 May following an advance scouting party sent to gather intelligence on the beach where the party would land. Under ideal cloudy skies, the Recce team's trip had been slowed by the need to launch their boats further from shore than anticipated. The longer journey, as well as rough seas, threw off the precise timing of the mission. Near shore, Captain Wynand Du Toit noticed a small fishing vessel in the area of the landing zone and that the occupants were on shore around a fire. This forced the team to wait offshore until the boat left the area. They were now three hours behind schedule, and the danger of being detected grew.
Upon landing the boats were hidden and a rendezvous point set up. The men climbed a bluff and followed a route that skirted a small village and led to a road. They miscalculated the distance to the road and turned back, losing an hour of valuable time. Du Toit decided to continue and reach the lying up position (LUP) in a densely wooded area within the two hours prior to dawn. South African Intelligence and aerial photographs showed an uninhabited area, but in fact it was surrounded by camouflaged People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) bases. The hide was finally reached as day broke. This proved to be far from ideal as a hiding place, as it was not part of the jungle, but an island of dense growth some distance from the jungle. The Recces hid in the undergrowth and spread into a defensive perimeter, one man at an observation post several yards to the north with a view of the course they had travelled.
As dawn broke, the features of a well-hidden FAPLA base became clear some from the LUP. A few hours later, a small FAPLA patrol could be seen following the tracks in the dew that they had left earlier. The team watched as the patrol withdrew, and then came back with a larger patrol which passed the hide. At 17.00 a three-men patrol followed the team's trail directly to the thicket where the Recces were hidden. They stopped short of entering the brush, and returned to their base. Meanwhile, a second patrol approached the hide from the other direction, and opened up heavy fire on the hidden position. As rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) struck their position, Captain Du Toit ordered the withdrawal of his troops. They had no choice but to double back on the trail that brought them to this position the previous night. Two of the men were wounded as they exited the trees. FAPLA troops deployed west of the site opened up with RPD machine guns, RPG and many AK-47s.
The team turned north, pursued by FAPLA soldiers. Another group of Angolan soldiers advanced from the west, flanking the Recces so that they could only go east now. They could see a group of trees, but needed to cross of waist-high grass to get to this cover. Du Toit took two men and made his way through the grass as the rest of the team hid in the thicket. The small team drew fire as over 30 troops moved onto the exposed position. Two South Africans (Corporal Rowland Liebenberg and Sergeant Louis van Breda) were killed and Du Toit was wounded and later captured.
The contact was over and two South African soldiers, corporals Liebenberg and Van Breda were dead. While Du Toit lay on his stomach, FAPLA soldiers approached and, thinking he was also dead, stripped his equipment – only then did they realise he was alive and shot him again through the neck. He remained awake with wounds in his neck, shoulder and arm as the FAPLA soldiers began to savagely beat him. The soldiers thought that he was a mercenary, though Du Toit tried to explain that he was in fact a South African Army officer. After being severely roughed up, he was finally taken to Cabinda for medical treatment then to a Luanda hospital.
Aftermath.
The remaining six Recce soldiers carefully made their way north, where they regrouped and were eventually picked up to be returned safely to South Africa. Their escape was due in part to being ignored after the Angolans captured Du Toit.
While imprisoned, Du Toit was interviewed by Jesse Jackson in August 1986. The Red Cross facilitated Du Toit's wife visiting him in prison on three separate occasions.
Captain Wynand du Toit was finally to be released on 7 September 1987 after some 837 days of solitary confinement in an Angolan prison in a complicated prisoner exchange arrangement brokered by Jean-Yves Ollivier. The exchange took place in Maputo, Mozambique where Du Toit was swapped for two ANC members and 133 Angolan soldiers.
SSgt Queiroz was awarded the Honoris Crux for his actions during the operation.

Space (Ibiza nightclub)

Space (, , ) was a superclub on the island of Ibiza, Spain from 1986 to 2016, owned by STANCA. In 2022 the brand opened a bar near Cafe Mambo. They sometimes run popup events around the world, but don't have a fixed club at the time of writing in 2023. 
It was awarded "Best Global Club" at the International Dance Music Awards in 2005, 2006, 2012, 2013, and 2014. Space was located in Platja d'en Bossa on the outskirts of Ibiza Town, close to the airport. In 2017, Hï Ibiza opened in Space Ibiza's original location. Space Ibiza announced in 2021 that it would reopen its doors in 2022. This resulted in the new Space Bar near Cafe Mambo, though the club night is yet to return to Ibiza, however the club has since opened at a new location in Riccione, Italy.
History.
Space first opened in early summer of 1986. The opening night featured the opening of the water park Aguamar located behind the club, party-goers being able to take advantage of the waterslides at night.
Space in its current form began in 1989 when Pepe Rosello, Ibiza nightclub owner since 1963, took over the establishment, which in the four years since it was built had housed a conference hall with a discothèque. The opening policy agreed with Spanish licensing laws, which state that an establishment must close for at least two hours a day.
Following the closure of three of Ibiza's clubs at the start of the 2007 season, local authorities have hinted at plans to alter the licensing regulations that allow clubs to open for 22 hours per day. Suggestions at present would allow for clubs to open at noon. Clubs may not open before 8 a.m.
Space, DC10 and Bora-Bora in Sant Josep allows after-hours parties.
The first DJs to shape the venue into its current shape were Alex P and Brandon Block, two British club DJs/producers and residents of Sunday Space Terrace — Space's outdoor terrace, where airliners roar overhead. This open terrace and the roaring sound of the airliners breaking through the booming dance music has become one of the club's defining features. Since Amnesia and Privilege have had to encase their open-air dance floors due to noise complaints from their neighbours, Space remains one of the few venues where club-goers can have this experience, and the crowd's greeting of the arriving aircraft has also become a ritual among the club's patrons.
Other resident DJs/producers responsible for the club's popularity include Reche, Jose de Divina, Jon Ulysses and Monkey.
Carl Cox was most associated with the club for nearly 15 years, thanks to his "Music is Revolution" night. When Pepe Rosello stepped down from the club, Cox decided to move on, playing a nine-hour final set in September 2016. Space released compilations every year via the former Azuli label and now with CR2 Records.
Post closure.
Since the club closed in 2016, it has since been bought by Ushuaïa Entertainment and was reopened in 2017 under the name Hï Ibiza.
Notable events.
"We Love Sundays".
Space's Flagship Sunday sessions began in 1999. "We Love... Space" is a weekly party which opens at 4:30p.m. on Sunday and keeps going until 6:00a.m. Monday morning. The event runs for 16 weeks throughout the summer season.
Notable DJs.
Martin Garrix, DJ black coffee, Armin van Buuren, David Guetta, Sven Väth, Nicolas Jaar, Josh Wink, Carl Cox, DJ Koze, Dr. Motte, Michel v. Tell, Dj Hell, Dixon, Tom Novy, Nicole Moudaber, Groove Armada, David Morales, Daniel Avery, Joseph Capriati, Danny Tenaglia, Julio Bashmore, Maceo Plex, Claude VonStroke, Carl Craig, Tiga, Fatboy Slim, Eats Everything, Seth Troxler, Green Velvet, Yousef, Joris Voorn, Steve Bug, Marcel Dettmann.
Affiliated clubs.
In 2010 Space opened an affiliate club in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt named Space Sharm. Two years later, on 29 December 2012, Space opened another affiliate club in Balneário Camboriú, Santa Catarina, Brazil, named Space B.

Luray High School

Luray High School is a public secondary school located in Luray, Virginia, United States. Luray High School is home to approximately 500 students, ranging from grades 9-12. Before construction of the new Luray High School building, it was one of the few 5-year high schools in the nation. The school is part of the Page County Public School System.
The school's colors are maroon, black, and white, and the mascot is the bulldog. The fight song is "Maroon and White".
History.
Luray High School began operations in 1903, led by principal Mr. Thomas G. Hamilton. At this time, the school was located on Court Street. In 1930, a new school building was constructed on Luray Avenue, leaving the old facility to be used by the local government until its demolition in 2014. The school housed eleven grades until the addition of grade 12 in 1950.
Until construction of a new elementary school in 1961, the Luray High School facility housed all school grades. After the construction of Luray Elementary School, the high school facility housed grades 8-12. This, along with the 1961 addition of the gym and vocational complexes, allowed for a significant expansion of the curriculum.
Extensive renovations took place between 1981-82. An improved heating and ventilation system was installed, and a new office complex, library, cafeteria, and music department were created to alleviate space needs. Additional space for instruction was also created by the conversion of the Bradley House to the art department and the addition of two mobile units as two new classrooms. A new art building was created in 2001-02 when the previous building, the former Bradley House, caught on fire and was deemed unusable.
In 2003, Luray High School celebrated its 100th anniversary.
In August 2006, the Page County Board of Supervisors approved construction of two new high schools in the county, and ground was broken in November 2006. The new building was constructed on the outskirts of Luray, in the unincorporated town of Leaksville. The building was dedicated on August 29, 2009, and the first day of school was September 8.
Luray High School houses grades 9-12 and has adopted block scheduling. During the summer of 2009, the former high school on Luray Avenue was transformed into Luray Middle School, which now houses grades 6-8.
Despite the relocation of the school, Luray High School still uses Bulldog Field for its baseball and football games. The complex also has a track. However, for home cross country practices and meets, the team uses the new course at the new high school.

Jack Erwin Russell (October 24, 1905 – November 3, 1990) was a Major League Baseball player from 1926 to 1940 for the Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, Cleveland Indians, Washington Senators, Detroit Tigers and St. Louis Cardinals. Russell was mainly a pitcher and his career marks were 85 wins, 141 losses, and a 4.46 ERA. After his baseball career ended, Russell settled in Clearwater, Florida, and was instrumental in raising money to build a baseball stadium, Jack Russell Memorial Stadium, which became the spring training home of the Philadelphia Phillies beginning in 1955 and continuing through 2003, when the team moved to Bright House Networks Field, also in Clearwater.
Russell died November 3, 1990, in Clearwater, Florida.

Church of the Ascension (Clearwater, Florida)

Church of the Ascension is an Episcopal church in Clearwater, Florida. Its name comes from the words of one of the founders, "It was a miracle the way our church did ascend from our prayers". The church is located in the Harbor Oaks Residential District and is considered by many locally to be an important historic site. The church also has a carillon, the Betty Jane Dimmitt Memorial Carillon, which has 49 bells and is one of just four such towers in the state of Florida. 
In addition to the organ and the carillon, the church's current building, built in gothic style around 1925, features 28 stained glass windows (the oldest of which dates back to 1895) which feature, among other things, the Ascension of Jesus Christ (in a large window over the altar), the Ten Commandments, the parable of the Good Shepherd, the parable of the Lost Son, and the "war window" where a candle is lit in remembrance of the Iraq war. Many have gone to pray at this window for loved ones involved in the war.
History.
According to its website, the church was founded 1885, when sixteen people met in a home to organize a new 
church. As the church grew the still small congregation moved the church into several other buildings before it was moved to its current location near downtown Clearwater. The church nave was extended later to its current size to include a balcony (where the organ console sits) and an increase in the seating capacity.
When Saint Paul's School first opened in 1968, classes were housed at the church.
In 1982, church member Larry Dimmit donated the Betty Jane Dimmit Memorial Carillon, composed of 49 cast bronze bells from the Royal Eijsbouts bell foundry in the Netherlands, which was installed on Dec. 5 of that year. The bells are now played at least weekly before or after church services, although in the 2001 Christmas season, the bells were played daily in remembrance of the September 11, 2001 attacks.
In 2003 the church installed a new pipe organ by Orgues Létourneau, which is the ninth largest in Florida (by number of ranks) with 4,182 pipes (3,235 in the Gallery and 947 in the Chancel) and 78 ranks.
The church currently lists approximately 285 families as members. , Carol Schwenke, the first woman to be ordained a priest in the Episcopal Diocese of Southwest Florida, serves as Sunday assistant.
Unique Events.
The church is unique in Pinellas County for offering The Alpha Marriage Course.
Outreach.
The church is a focal point for several outreach programs.
The church also participates in various Episcopal charities, such as the Episcopal Relief and Development program. The church regularly participates in "mission trips;" in 2004 and 2005, parishioners went to the Dominican Republic to help reconstruct a church, and from 1999–2002, the Ascension senior youth group went to the Wind River Indian Reservation to repair a decrepit fellowship center.

Benjamin Patrick Aris (16 March 1937 – 4 September 2003) was an English actor who was best known for his parts in "Hi-de-Hi!" and "To the Manor Born", and was also very active on stage. He was often cast as an eccentric, upper-class or upper-middle class man.
Early life and education.
Benjamin Patrick Aris was born on 16 March 1937 in London, and following the Second World War, he trained at the Arts Educational School. 
At the age of 16, he joined a national tour of the show "Zip Goes a Million". He then did his national service in the British Army.
Early career.
After completing his national service, Aris appeared in many musicals and films, including "The Plague of the Zombies", "The Charge of the Light Brigade" and "if...".
On stage, Aris was in the 1960 production of the revue "One Over The Eight" at the Duke of York's Theatre in London.
He also appeared in Tony Richardson's 1969 production of "Hamlet" at London's "Roundhouse", its New York transfer to the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, and also its film version the same year.
Film and television career.
His first television role was in the children's series "Jamie" in 1971. He also appeared in "Invasion of the Dinosaurs", a 1974 "Doctor Who" serial. His other early television roles included "Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em", "Sam and the River" (1975), "Crown Court", "Wodehouse Playhouse" and "Target". During that time he also appeared in the films "Get Carter", "The Three Musketeers", "Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World" and "Juggernaut".

<doc id="6994321" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6994321" title="Mushihimesama Futari">
Mushihimesama Futari

 is a bullet hell shooter video game released in arcades by Cave on October 27, 2006 and it is a sequel to "Mushihimesama" (2004). "Mushihimesama Futari" was released on the Xbox 360 in Japan on November 26, 2009. In April 2012, Cave released a port of the game on the iOS platforms, titled Bug Princess 2 ("Mushihimesama" was also released on the platforms titled "Bug Princess").
Gameplay.
Selectable game modes include Original and Maniac, with unlockable Ultra mode, with each mode increasing in difficulty. The game features five stages, each with a boss and mid-boss. The players can select two characters - Reco and Palm, and choose normal or abnormal shot type for each. The main scoring system in this game involves collecting gems. In Original and Ultra mode, the gem counter switches colour from green to blue every 500 gems. the players collect more gems by killing enemies with the player's laser when the counter is blue, and with the player's shot when the counter is green. There is an overall gem counter and a stage counter, which resets to zero every level. In Maniac mode, when the chain bar is full and flashing red, killing enemies with A increases the number of gems acquired.
Version 1.5 replaced Version 1.0 as the standard version of the game. Item and game system was changed as well as modified bullet patterns, particularly on the bosses. Considered easier than Version 1.0(1). Ultra mode unlocked from the start. Gem counter switches colour every 2000 (instead of 500) in Version 1.5 Ultra mode.
Plot.
The basic plot revolves around the death of the antagonist from the first game, Aki, and his mother, Larsa, going insane and seeking revenge on Reco for allegedly killing him. Her younger son Palm goes in search of Reco to learn the truth about his brother on his own. Eventually Reco finds Palm lost far from home and the two become friends, with Palm learning what happened to Aki was not her fault. Together, they aim to travel back to Palm's home and stop the madness of Larsa. Larsa is the main antagonist of the story; she pilots Stage 5's boss, Dragon Emperion.
Development.
"Mushihimesama Futari" does not allow changing of player's shot during mid-game and each character has a specific shot-type associated with them.
Even though "Mushihimesama Futari" was only released in Japan, it was released without a region lock; allowing the game to be played on non-Japanese consoles — This decision was due to heavy support from overseas fans. CAVE ultimately released a few subsequent Xbox 360 shooters in region-free format, including "Espgaluda II Black Label", "Muchi Muchi Pork!", and "".
The "Mushihimesama Futari" original soundtrack was released on CD on May 30, 2007 in Japan and was published by Cave.
Releases.
Xbox 360.
The Xbox 360 release includes Version 1.5, Novice and Arrange game modes. The player can select between original arcade graphics, and new high resolution graphics. The players can play the game in tate (vertical monitor), with numerous graphical options, including scanlines. The Xbox 360 exclusive arrange mode allows 1 player only to play through the game with special rules. If a player is a hit they do not die and instead a bomb is launched on contact (unless the player does not have any bombs), the player is allowed to switch between controlling Reco or Palm, with the non-active character ghosting alongside the active one while shooting, changing also generates a temporary shield. Selecting shot type is not available in this mode however.
"Black Label" could be downloaded for 1200 Microsoft Points from the Xbox Live Marketplace under the misspelled title "Mushihime-sama Hutari Black Lavel" as an add-on only, not the full game. First print editions included Version 1.01 via a download code. The limited edition release for Xbox 360 came with an arrange soundtrack CD, an Xbox 360 faceplate and either a version A (Reco) or version B (Palm and Aki) telephone card. A Platinum Edition was later released. All versions of the game are region-free.
iOS.
The game includes a "wait control" option where the player can make the bullets slow down when numerous. This is technically the first time the game was released internationally. On June of the same year, the Black Label version of the game was released globally under the name "Bug Princess 2 BLACK LABEL".
Reception.
"Famitsu" magazine awarded "Mushihimesama Futari ver. 1.5" a score of 29/40 based on four reviews (8/7/7/7).

Jauerfood

Jauerfood was a company that supplied East German residents with food paid for by friends and relatives in the West or by East German residents' West German bank accounts. It was founded in 1956 in Copenhagen, Denmark, by Gunnar Jauer.
History.
Beginning in 1959, East Germany did not allow its citizens to withdraw their funds from accounts held in West German banks, hence many East Germany citizens had substantial savings that they could not utilize. Jauerfood (and the Zürich-based company Palatinus) made an agreement with the East German Trade association Genex to export goods to East Germany, in return for a 5% commission to Genex.
Through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the trade grew. In 1988, just prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall, Jauerfood's gross earnings were approximately US$175,000,000. 1988 was the final year the company was fully operational. By the end of 1989, Cold War had ended and the company's reason for being had vanished.

<doc id="6994344" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6994344" title="Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline">
Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline

The Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline (, ) is a proposed subsea pipeline between Türkmenbaşy in Turkmenistan, and Baku in Azerbaijan. According to some proposals it would also include a connection between the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan, the Sangachal Terminal in Baku, and Türkmenbaşy. The Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline project would transport natural gas from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to European Union member countries, circumventing both Russia and Iran. It would do this by feeding the Southern Gas Corridor. This project attracts significant interest since it would connect vast Turkmen gas resources to major consumers Turkey and Europe.
History.
End of 1990s.
A project to import natural gas from Turkmenistan through a subsea pipeline was suggested in 1996 by the United States. In February 1999, the Turkmen government entered into an agreement with General Electric and Bechtel Group for a feasibility study on the proposed pipeline. In 1999, while attending the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan signed a number of agreements concerned with construction of pipelines. However, because of Russian and Iranian opposition to the project, an unresolved legal dispute over Caspian Sea territorial boundaries and a gas discovery on Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz field, the submarine pipeline project was shelved in the summer of 2000 and only the South Caucasus Pipeline project continued.
2006–2007.
In January 2006, as a result of the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute, interest in the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline project was rekindled. On 11 January 2006, Azerbaijan's prime-minister Artur Rasizade proposed to his Kazakhstan counterpart Daniyal Akhmetov that Kazakhstan gas be exported through the South Caucasus Pipeline to Turkey and from there to the European market. In March 2006, Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov signaled his intention to rejoin possible negotiations on the pipeline. In May 2006, during his visit to Kazakhstan, the European Commissioner for Energy Andris Piebalgs professed EU support for the construction of the Trans-Caspian pipeline. Azerbaijan's Industry and Energy Minister Natig Aliyev, while addressing an international energy conference in Baku, outlined the advantages of the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline for diversifying supplies and restraining prices. On the other hand, Russia's Industry and Energy Minister Viktor Khristenko commented that existing technical, legal, environmental and other risks relating to the trans-Caspian project are so great that it would be impossible to find an investor unless there is political backing for the project. On 12 May 2007, an agreement was signed between Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan providing for Central Asian gas to be exported to Europe through the reconstructed and expanded western branch of the Central Asia-Center gas pipeline system. This was seen as a setback for the realization of the Trans-Caspian Pipeline although Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow said that the Trans-Caspian pipeline project was not canceled.
2008.
On 4 September 2008, Iran's deputy foreign minister Mehti Safari confirmed that Tehran opposes the construction of any undersea pipelines in the Caspian because of environmental concerns. This jeopardizes the Trans-Caspian Gas pipeline project, according to regional expert Paul Goble. However, on 22 December 2008 Austria's OMV and Germany's RWE, both partners in Nabucco Gas Pipeline International GmbH, announced they were setting up a joint venture named the Caspian Energy Company, to carry out exploration for a gas pipeline across the Caspian Sea that would feed into the Nabucco pipeline. Based on exploration outcomes the company plans to build and operate a gas transport system across the Caspian Sea.
2011–2012.
On 12 September 2011, the EU Foreign Affairs Council agreed to give a negotiating mandate to the European Commission for negotiations with Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan on the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline. On 3 September 2012, after the meeting between the European Commissioner for Energy Günther Oettinger, Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yıldız, and Azerbaijani and Turkmenistani officials in Ashgabat, Yıldız stated that Turkey will buy gas from Turkmenistan through the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline.
2013–2014.
An EU proposal generally named the Southern Gas Corridor project kindled interest in the Trans+Caspian pipeline as an alternative supply route to Gasprom monopoly to European Union markets. Turkmen gas would be carried along with Azeri gas from the Shah Deniz Gas Field by this pipeline.
2015–2016.
One part of the Southern Gas Corridor was laid between Greece and Italy via Albania (TAP Pipeline) starting in 2016. This pipeline was ultimately connected to the TANAP Pipeline across Turkey, construction of which began in 2015, and was designed to connect to the South Caucasus Pipeline at the Georgian border with Turkey. In addition, the East-West gas pipeline in Turkmenistan, connecting gas fields in the east of the country to the Caspian coast, was completed in December 2015.
2020.
In December 2020 the Southern Gas Corridor began operating, creating an opportunity for offtake of gas from a putative Transcaspian gas pipeline.
2021.
In June 2021 the Turkmenistan government official media outlet "Golden Age" statedExternal conditions for construction of Trans-Caspian gas pipeline of the total length of 300 km between Turkmen and Azeri coasts of Caspian Sea have become more favorable in the last years. Signing of the Convention on Legal Status of the Caspian Sea by five Caspian states on August 12, 2018 was very important. Another obstacle was covered on January 21 this year when the Memorandum of Understanding on joint exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources of Dostluk offshore field has been signed between the governments of Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan. The document has been already ratified by the Parliament of Turkmenistan.
Description.
The projected capacity of the pipeline is of natural gas per year at an estimated cost of US$5 billion. In Baku, it would link to the South Caucasus Pipeline (Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum pipeline), and through this with the planned Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline. A feasibility study for the project funded by the United States Trade and Development Agency is carried out by Granherne, a subsidiary of KBR.
Critics.
The project is heavily criticized by Russia and Iran, previously significant transit countries for Turkmen gas and current competitors. Alexander Golovin, special envoy on Caspian issues, has stated that a major gas pipeline would pose a serious, dangerous risk to the prosperity of the entire region. According to the Russian Natural Resources Ministry, any gas or oil pipelines across the floor of the Caspian Sea would be environmentally unacceptable. Russia has also taken the legal position that a potential pipeline project, regardless of the route it takes on the seabed, would require the consent of all five Caspian littoral states in order to proceed. Iran has pointed out that treaties signed by Iran and the Soviet Union in 1921 and 1940 are still in force and that any action taken without the consent of all the littoral states would be illegal. In regard of the decision taken by the EU on 12 September 2011, Russia expressed its "disappointment" as it "seems to have been adopted without taking into account the internationally accepted legal and geopolitical situation in the Caspian basin," and as Caspian Sea littoral state, Russia could veto any international agreement allowing for the pipeline to be built.
In reaction to the 1999 plans for a Trans-Caspian gas pipeline Russia and Iran collaborated in calling for a Central Asian gas cartel in 2001 and 2002. There was also a concern in the West that closer collaboration between Georgia and Azerbaijan would isolate Armenia and tempt it to strengthen ties with Russia and Iran.
In 2022 proponents of a rival pipeline between offshore installations said that the Trans-Caspian was not financially viable as the EU would not agree to a decades long contract as they are doing an energy transition.

<doc id="6994353" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6994353" title="Fractional factorial design">
Fractional factorial design

In statistics, a fractional factorial design is a way to conduct experiments with fewer experimental runs than a full factorial design. Instead of testing every single combination of factors, it tests only a carefully selected portion. This "fraction" of the full design is chosen to reveal the most important information about the system being studied (sparsity-of-effects principle), while significantly reducing the number of runs required. It is based on the idea that many tests in a full factorial design can be redundant. However, this reduction in runs comes at the cost of potentially more complex analysis, as some effects can become intertwined, making it impossible to isolate their individual influences. Therefore, choosing which combinations to test in a fractional factorial design must be done carefully.
History.
Fractional factorial design was introduced by British statistician David John Finney in 1945, extending previous work by Ronald Fisher on the full factorial experiment at Rothamsted Experimental Station. Developed originally for agricultural applications, it has since been applied to other areas of engineering, science, and business.
Basic working principle.
Similar to a full factorial experiment, a fractional factorial experiment investigates the effects of independent variables, known as factors, on a response variable. Each factor is investigated at different values, known as levels. The response variable is measured using a combination of factors at different levels, and each unique combination is known as a run. To reduce the number of runs in comparison to a full factorial, the experiments are designed to confound different effects and interactions, so that their impacts cannot be distinguished. Higher-order interactions between main effects are typically negligible, making this a reasonable method of studying main effects. This is the sparsity of effects principle. Confounding is controlled by a systematic selection of runs from a full-factorial table.
Notation.
Fractional designs are expressed using the notation "l"k − p, where "l" is the number of levels of each factor, "k" is the number of factors, and "p" describes the size of the fraction of the full factorial used. Formally, p is the number of generators; relationships that determine the intentionally confounded effects that reduce the number of runs needed. Each generator halves the number of runs required. A design with "p" such generators is a 1/("lp")="l−p" fraction of the full factorial design.
For example, a 25 − 2 design is 1/4 of a two-level, five-factor factorial design. Rather than the 32 runs that would be required for the full 25 factorial experiment, this experiment requires only eight runs. With two generators, the number of experiments has been halved twice.
In practice, one rarely encounters "l" &gt; 2 levels in fractional factorial designs as the methodology to generate such designs for more than two levels is much more cumbersome. In cases requiring 3 levels for each factor, potential fractional designs to pursue are Latin squares, mutually orthogonal Latin squares, and Taguchi methods. Response surface methodology can also be a much more experimentally efficient way to determine the relationship between the experimental response and factors at multiple levels, but it requires that the levels are continuous. In determining whether more than two levels are needed, experimenters should consider whether they expect the outcome to be nonlinear with the addition of a third level. Another consideration is the number of factors, which can significantly change the experimental labor demand.
The levels of a factor are commonly coded as +1 for the higher level, and −1 for the lower level. For a three-level factor, the intermediate value is coded as 0.
To save space, the points in a factorial experiment are often abbreviated with strings of plus and minus signs. The strings have as many symbols as factors, and their values dictate the level of each factor: conventionally, formula_1 for the first (or low) level, and formula_2 for the second (or high) level. The points in a two-level experiment with two factors can thus be represented as formula_3, formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6.
The factorial points can also be abbreviated by (1), a, b, and ab, where the presence of a letter indicates that the specified factor is at its high (or second) level and the absence of a letter indicates that the specified factor is at its low (or first) level (for example, "a" indicates that factor A is on its high setting, while all other factors are at their low (or first) setting). (1) is used to indicate that all factors are at their lowest (or first) values. Factorial points are typically arranged in a table using Yates’ standard order: 1, a, b, ab, c, ac, bc, abc, which is created when the level of the first factor alternates with each run.
Generation.
In practice, experimenters typically rely on statistical reference books to supply the "standard" fractional factorial designs, consisting of the "principal fraction". The "principal fraction" is the set of treatment combinations for which the generators evaluate to + under the treatment combination algebra. However, in some situations, experimenters may take it upon themselves to generate their own fractional design.
A fractional factorial experiment is generated from a full factorial experiment by choosing an "alias structure". The alias structure determines which effects are confounded with each other. For example, the five-factor 25 − 2 can be generated by using a full three-factor factorial experiment involving three factors (say "A"," B", and "C") and then choosing to confound the two remaining factors "D" and "E" with interactions generated by "D" = "A"*"B" and "E" = "A"*"C". These two expressions are called the "generators" of the design. So for example, when the experiment is run and the experimenter estimates the effects for factor "D", what is really being estimated is a combination of the main effect of "D" and the two-factor interaction involving "A" and "B".
An important characteristic of a fractional design is the defining relation, which gives the set of interaction columns equal in the design matrix to a column of plus signs, denoted by "I". For the above example, since "D" = "AB" and "E" = "AC", then "ABD" and "ACE" are both columns of plus signs, and consequently so is "BDCE":
"D*D" = "AB*D" = "I"
"E*E" = "AC*E" = "I"
"I"= "ABD*ACE"= "A*ABCDE" = "BCDE"
In this case, the defining relation of the fractional design is "I" = "ABD" = "ACE" = "BCDE". The defining relation allows the alias pattern of the design to be determined and includes 2p words. Notice that in this case, the interaction effects "ABD", "ACE", and "BCDE" cannot be studied at all. As the number of generators and the degree of fractionation increases, more and more effects become confounded.
The alias pattern can then be determined through multiplying by each factor column. To determine how main effect A is confounded, multiply all terms in the defining relation by A:
"A*I" = "A*ABD" = "A*ACE" = "A*BCDE"
"A" = "BC" = "CE" = "ABCDE"
Thus main effect A is confounded with interaction effects BC, CE, and ABCDE. Other main effects can be computed following a similar method.
Resolution.
An important property of a fractional design is its resolution or ability to separate main effects and low-order interactions from one another. Formally, if the factors are binary then the resolution of the design is the minimum word length in the defining relation excluding ("I"). The resolution is denoted using Roman numerals, and it increases with the number. The most important fractional designs are those of resolution III, IV, and V: Resolutions below III are not useful and resolutions above V are wasteful (with binary factors) in that the expanded experimentation has no practical benefit in most cases—the bulk of the additional effort goes into the estimation of very high-order interactions which rarely occur in practice. The 25 − 2 design above is resolution III since its defining relation is I = ABD = ACE = BCDE.
The resolution classification system described is only used for regular designs. Regular designs have run size that equal a power of two, and only full aliasing is present. Non-regular designs, sometimes known as Plackett-Burman designs, are designs where run size is a multiple of 4; these designs introduce partial aliasing, and generalized resolution is used as design criterion instead of the resolution described previously.
Resolution III designs can be used to construct saturated designs, where N-1 factors can be investigated in only N runs. These saturated designs can be used for quick screening when many factors are involved.
Example fractional factorial experiment.
Montgomery gives the following example of a fractional factorial experiment. An engineer performed an experiment to increase the filtration rate (output) of a process to produce a chemical, and to reduce the amount of formaldehyde used in the process. The full factorial experiment is described in the Wikipedia page Factorial experiment. Four factors were considered: temperature (A), pressure (B), formaldehyde concentration (C), and stirring rate (D). The results in that example were that the main effects A, C, and D and the AC and AD interactions were significant. The results of that example may be used to simulate a fractional factorial experiment using a half-fraction of the original 2"4" = 16 run design. The table shows the 2"4"-"1" = 8 run half-fraction experiment design and the resulting filtration rate, extracted from the table for the full 16 run factorial experiment.
In this fractional design, each main effect is aliased with a 3-factor interaction (e.g., A = BCD), and every 2-factor interaction is aliased with another 2-factor interaction (e.g., AB = CD). The aliasing relationships are shown in the table. This is a resolution IV design, meaning that main effects are aliased with 3-way interactions, and 2-way interactions are aliased with 2-way interactions.
The analysis of variance estimates of the effects are shown in the table below. From inspection of the table, there appear to be large effects due to A, C, and D. The coefficient for the AB interaction is quite small. Unless the AB and CD interactions have approximately equal but opposite effects, these two interactions appear to be negligible. If A, C, and D have large effects, but B has little effect, then the AC and AD interactions are most likely significant. These conclusions are consistent with the results of the full-factorial 16-run experiment.
Because B and its interactions appear to be insignificant, B may be dropped from the model. Dropping B results in a full factorial 2"3" design for the factors A, C, and D. Performing the anova using factors A, C, and D, and the interaction terms A:C and A:D, gives the results shown in the table, which are very similar to the results for the full factorial experiment experiment, but have the advantage of requiring only a half-fraction 8 runs rather than 16.

Mario Perez (artist)

Mario Perez (born June 17, 1943) is a Cuban artist.
Art.
Perez emigrated to the United States as a teenager and has focused his artistic career primarily on documenting the pre-war Havana of his youth. He is noted for his urban landscapes often recreated from memory. His work has become especially popular in Cuban expatriate communities, such as in south Florida, where collectors celebrate his ability to recapture the tone and atmosphere of 1940s and 1950s Cuba before the revolution. Perez works primarily in a combination of pen/ink and watercolor, though some of his most noted (and most overtly political) work appears in oil on canvas. These include "La Muerte de José Martí", depicting the death of the Cuban national hero and poet who led the nation's independence movement against Spain, and who died in a charge during the Battle of Dos Rios.
Perez is also known for his work in charcoal, in particular his series of portraits of jazz musicians, many of whom performed in Cuba prior to the country's fall to communism. As an untrained artist who grew up on the impoverished streets of Havana, Perez's family had no money to purchase art supplies, leaving him drawing with broken pencil nubs on scraps of paper. He left Cuba at the age of 15, after the death of his mother, and did not return for more than 40 years. A visit to Cuba in 2000, after receiving an entry visa from Fidel Castro's government, led to a particularly productive period in his work.
Perez's style is classified as primitive art, also called naive art, a category used to describe notable work produced by artists without formal schooling, such as Grandma Moses, and which captures instinctive artistic expressions without the typical conventions and uniformity of classically educated instruction.
Family.
Perez has a wife, Margaret, and three children. Perez currently resides in Yorba Linda, California.

Erik Bulatov

Erik Bulatov (; born September 5, 1933) is a Russian artist, who was raised in Moscow. His father was a communist party official who died in World War II at Pskov, and his mother fled Poland at age 15 in support of the Russian Revolution. Bulatov's works are in the major public and private collections in Europe, Russia, and United States. In 2008 Bulatov became an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Arts. In 2015 Bulatov was made the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres.
Early life.
Education.
Bulatov studied painting at the Surikov Art Institute in Moscow, graduating in 1958. He began working as a children’s book illustrator with friend and collaborator, Oleg Vassiliev for which he won numerous awards. Both artists were immensely influenced by Robert Falk and Vladimir Favorsky two artists of the early-twentieth century Russian avant-garde.
Sretensky Boulevard Group.
In the 1960s Bulatov formed the Sretensky Boulevard Group with Ilya Kabakov, Edik Steinberg, Oleg Vassiliev, Vladimir Yankilevsky, and Viktor Pivovarov. Named by a Czech historian for the block on which they lived, the group often met at Kabakov's to discuss and show their work as they were not permitted to do so in "official" settings. This group was more of an association of like-minded artists rather than a school with similar stylistic tendencies.
Through the Sretensky Boulevard Group, Bulatov became a prominent member of the loosely affiliated Moscow Conceptualists. This group, related ideologically rather than stylistically, has defined the "Moscow School" of contemporary Russian art as it is known today.
Style.
It is thought that Bulatov works in sots art style. "Bulatov's paintings are large, colorful, realistic images of landscapes, skies, urban settings, and people, many of which are painted over and partially obscured by wry words or phrases. Metaphorically rich and poetic blue skies are overlaid with Russian texts that translate: 'Glory to the U.S.S.R.' or 'Trademark'. Lush, green landscapes toil under the labels 'Not To Be Leaned On' or 'Caution.' But Bulatov in one of his recent interview indicates that he has nothing to do with Sots Art. Sots Art according Bulatov is an irony. And irony is absent in his work.
Bulatov's subject matter is broad. Equally broad is his perception of the government's role in the classification and control of everything. Bulatov symbolizes the government through his use of language as a system of order and control, the foundation of written law and constraint which he then plasters on every tree and rock. It is in this sense that Bulatov's paintings may take on a more universal accuracy and a more populist appeal. His emphasis on only the public and external aspects of life--the street, the land, the State television broadcast--reinforces the notion that one's thoughts and feelings are (still) one's own. the psychological and emotional are beyond the confines of words, language and law."
Career.
Erik Bulatov is currently represented by ARNDT Berlin, SKOPIA Geneva and pop/off/art gallery Moscow - Berlin.

Ramachandi Temple

Ramachandi Temple is located at a spot on the banks of the Kusabhadra River where it flows into the Bay of Bengal. It is only 5 km away from Konark in the Puri District of Odisha, India. Goddess Ramachandi, the deity of Konark is thought by some to be the presiding deity of this temple, while others thought it to be the temple of Mayadevi, wife of Surya (Sun God).
Location.
The temple of Goddess "Ramachandi" on the river mouth of Kushabhadra river is a popular picnic spot. It is situated 7 km before Konark on the Marine drive road from Puri to Konark. Ramachandi is popularly believed to be the presiding deity of Konark, and the most benevolent Chandi known. It is certainly more ancient than the Sun Temple at Konark. From the architectural point of view, the temple of Ramachandi is not important but from the religious point of view, it is one of the famous Shakta pithas of Odisha.
Before construction of the Marine Drive road, the place was not accessible to outside visitors. However it attracted a large number of local devotees to offer sacrifices or 'Bali' in the month of Ashwina.
History.
A legend regarding the deity is popular among the locals. Kalapahad, the rebel Hindu Brahmin youth who got converted to Islam, vowed to destroy all the temples of Hindu worship during the 17th century. After destroying the Sun temple, Kalapahad approached Ramachandi temple to destroy it. Then Goddess Ramachandi dressed as a "Maluni" (a maid servant) asked Kalapahad to wait at the door till she brings water from the river for the Goddess. Kalapahad anxiously waited for a long time to get some cold water. When it was too late and the Maluni did not return he was exhausted and entered inside the temple and found the throne empty. Then he thought the Maluni took away the deity with her and with anger he followed the "Maluni". When he reached the bank of the Kushabhadra river he found the goddess Ramachandi floating in the middle of the river. At that time the river was outpouring, so he came back without being able to reach the middle of the river. Then Goddess Ramachandi came in dream of a "Panda" (priest) and told him to build a temple on the bank of the Kushabhadra river. This place is now known as Ramachandi. Throughout the year many visitors come here to get the blessing of Goddess Ramachandi and to enjoy the scenery of river Kushabhadra and Bay of Bengal.
Now the temple has collapsed leaving remains of its broken walls and the empty throne. There is no historical evidence to conclude about its presiding deity.

Bonham (band)

Bonham were a British/Canadian hard rock and heavy metal band founded in 1988 by drummer Jason Bonham, the son of late Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. The band's most successful line-up was also its initial one which included late singer Daniel MacMaster, bassist/keyboardist John Smithson, and guitarist Ian Hatton. The band had released four studio albums between 1989 and 1997.
History.
In 1989, their debut album "The Disregard of Timekeeping" topped the rock airplay charts on the success of the single "Wait for You" and helped Bonham garner a gold record from the RIAA in 1990. The band toured extensively for two years, but the impact of such early success on its young members caused a great deal of internal friction. After a lengthy tour, Bonham released their second and final album together, "Mad Hatter". Jason Bonham then decided to concentrate on session work and writing new music.
In 1994, Jason Bonham reunited with Ian Hatton and John Smithson from his former band, this time featuring new lead vocalist Marti Frederiksen. This new lineup was known as Motherland. They released one album titled "Peace 4 Me". Following the abortive Motherland project, Jason put together the Jason Bonham Band, recruiting lead vocalist Chas West, guitarist Tony Catania, and Smithson on bass and keyboards. Their 1997 album "When You See the Sun" was produced by ex-Motherland lead vocalist Marti Frederiksen and features backing vocals by Jason's aunt Debbie Bonham on the track "Turning Back the Time". It was preceded by "In the Name of My Father - The Zepset - Live from Electric Ladyland", released by the Bonham / West / Catania / Smithson line-up earlier that same year.
On 16 March 2008, former lead vocalist Daniel MacMaster died at the age of 39 from a Group A streptococcal infection which he thought was a cold and developed sepsis.
Original Bonham vocalist Paul Rafferty, together with fellow Brit Sean Manning, former guitarist for Quiet Riot and Hurricane, released the Led Zeppelin influenced "The Exiles" album in 1996 under the name Sean Manning &amp; Paul Rafferty. He has since retired from music and become a respected painter based in the South of France, California and London. Rafferty guested with guitarist Joe Bonamassa at several stops during the 2009 "The Ballad of John Henry" tour, including the Nice Jazz Festival, and again the following year on the "Black Rock" tour, including the show in Zagreb, Croatia.
Post-Bonham bands and projects.
Bonham appeared in the movies in 2000 as part of the fictitious band Steel Dragon fronted by actor Mark Wahlberg in the film "Rock Star" (also known as "Metal God"). His partners in this project were Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde.
Bonham joined American act Healing Sixes in 2000. Healing Sixes was based in Indianapolis, IN. Their Manager Rick Hudnall arranged a two-week tour for them opening for The Jason Bonham Band. That tour was through the Midwest. Hudnall says "I noticed as the tour went on Jason would spend more and more time in the back of the venues watching and listening to Healing Sixes as opening set. That led to an impromptu jam with the band's vocalist Doug Henthorn, guitarist Eric Saylors and bassist Chaz Winzenread. It went so well that about two songs into it Jason asked to join Healing Sixes. Together they went on to record an album "Enormosound" on Corazong Records. It was recorded at The Hit Factory in New York City and produced by Kevin "Caveman" Shirley. Album cover art was done by Storm Thorgerson.
Since making his studio debut on "When You See the Sun" with the Jason Bonham Band, vocalist Chas West has recorded with 3 Legged Dogg and Resurrection Kings, both featuring Vinny Appice of Black Sabbath and Dio fame, Tribe of Gypsies, and Tango Down, and is currently fronting his own band, West Bound, whose debut album, "Volume I", is slated for an early 2019 release.
West appeared with the new Foreigner, featuring Jason Bonham on drums, at their 25 July 2004 show in Santa Barbara, California, at Fess Parker's Doubletree Resort, a benefit for muscular dystrophy, but was subsequently replaced by Kelly Hansen. West has also worked as a touring vocalist with Lynch Mob, Steve Priest's Sweet, Diamond Head, and Jake E. Lee's Red Dragon Cartel. He is the vocalist for Los Angeles, California-based Led Zeppelin tribute band, The Moby Dicks, who have appeared at the annual Bonzo Bash festivities.

Parents Just Don't Understand

"Parents Just Don't Understand" is the second single from American duo DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince's second studio album, "He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper" (1988). In the song, the Fresh Prince details his problems with his parents, whom he feels do not understand the challenges of being a teenager.
The song was released as a single in spring 1988 by Jive and peaked at number 12 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100. It won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance at the 1989 Grammy Awards, one of the two songs to do so before the award was discontinued in 1991. The song was referenced several times in the television show "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" and was ranked number 96 on VH1's "100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop". It was also featured in the movies "The Parent Trap" (1998), (2001) "Malibu's Most Wanted" (2003) and "Jersey Girl" (2004).
Composition and lyrics.
In the first verse, the Fresh Prince recounts the time he went to the Gallery Mall with his family to buy clothes for the upcoming school year. His mother buys him clothes that do not align with his personal tastes, including bell-bottoms and a plaid shirt with a butterfly collar. On the first day of school, the Prince attempts to fake being sick, with no success. Forced to wear the clothes that his mother chose for him, the Prince is met with ridicule from his schoolmates. 
In the second verse, the Prince recounts the time he took the family Porsche out for a drive while his parents were on vacation, despite not yet having a driver's license. He picks up an attractive young girl and takes her to McDonald's. When the Prince shows off the car's speed, he is pulled over by the police, and finds out that the girl he picked up was a tween runaway. The Prince is arrested and his parents have to cut their vacation short to bail him out; they angrily assault him on the way home.
Critical reception.
Jack Barron from "NME" wrote, "Over a hip-bone-quaking bass and horns that blow harder than a hurricane The Fresh Prince tells a domestic tale that halfway through turns into a nightmare when his mom buys him zits for his birthday and dresses him in flares. Mind you he's his own worst enemy, making typical mistakes like stealing his parents' car to impress his girlfriend and striking out until he gets arrested by the police for not having a licence. [...] Wack it up the next time you have an argument with your ma and pa."
Notable cover versions.
Lil' Romeo, 3LW, and Nick Cannon recorded a cover for the "" soundtrack in 2001. T-Squad covered the song in 2007 on their only album "T-Squad".
Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) sang part of the song in the cold open of season 2 episode 1 of "Parks and Recreation", "Pawnee Zoo" in 2009.

Plot.
In an unknown alien galaxy far away from the Milky Way, a war is waging between the Tilde Fleet, a group of human-like people and mysteriously violent robotic vehicles known as the Ver’mith led by the mysterious young woman Faintear. Two humanoid-soldiers belonging to the Triggerheart strike team, Exelica and programmed sister Crueltear, were busily fighting the Ver’mith during an attack when a portal opened and sucked the two young women in. Materializing on planet Earth, Exelica and Crueltear soon made Earth their new home as they had no means of return until a new portal opened and the Ver'mith appeared. Intent on making Earth their primary fortress of attack, the Ver'mith quickly make short work of Earth's Defenses. Earth's only hope rests on the Triggerheart sisters.

Honky Tonk Heroes

Honky Tonk Heroes is an album by Waylon Jennings, released in 1973 on RCA Victor. Most of the songs on the album were written or co-written by Billy Joe Shaver. The album is considered an important piece in the development of the outlaw sub-genre in country music as it revived the honky tonk music of Nashville and added elements of rock and roll.
Jennings had recently renegotiated his contract with RCA Records, granting him creative control over his work. As his usual producer, Chet Atkins, was reluctant to release a record consisting of songs written by newcomer Shaver, Jennings replaced Atkins with Tompall Glaser. Jennings recorded the album his own band the Waylors.
"Honky Tonk Heroes" had a good reception by music critics. It reached number 14 in "Billboard"s Top Country albums chart. The singles "You Asked Me To" and "We Had It All" reached number 8 and 28. The album was listed in Robert Dimery's "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die" in 2005.
Background.
Waylon Jennings and his manager Neil Reshen had renegotiated the singer's contract with RCA Records in 1972, which gave him creative control over his work. By 1973, Atlantic Records was attempting to sign Jennings who, with fellow country singer Willie Nelson, had become dissatisfied with RCA because of the company's conservative influence upon their music. Nelson, who had signed with Atlantic, was becoming more popular, and this persuaded RCA to renegotiate with Jennings before it lost another potential success.
Jennings' creative input in the recording process had increased on the releases of "Good Hearted Woman" (1972), "Ladies Love Outlaws" (1972) and "Lonesome, On'ry and Mean" (1973). Jennings attempted to duplicate the sound of his live performances in the recording studio. He used his backing band, The Waylors, and his own choice of material.
Recording and composition.
Jennings met Billy Joe Shaver at the 1972 Dripping Springs Reunion in Dripping Springs, Texas. As Shaver took part on a guitar pull with other songwriters, he interpreted his original "Willy the Wondering Gypsy and Me". Jennings, who was resting at the back of the trailer, heard Shaver and asked him if he had written "any more of them 'ol cowboy songs". Impressed by Shaver's originals, Jennings offered him to record an entire album of his songs. Shaver then travelled to Nashville, Tennessee, where he tried to unsuccessfully locate Jennings, who avoided him for six months. With the help of local D.J. Roger "Captain Midnight" Schutt, Shaver found Jennings at a RCA recording session with producer Chet Atkins. He tried to confront the singer, who offered Shaver $100. Shaver refused the money and told Jennings that he was willing to fight him if he would not listen to his songs.
Jennings offered to record "Willy the Wandering Gypsy and Me" and told Shaver to sing another song – if Jennings liked it he would record it and Shaver could sing another; but if he did not like it, Shaver would have to leave. Shaver sang "Ain't No God in Mexico", followed by "Honky Tonk Heroes" and "Old Five and Dimers and Me". Jennings was impressed, and he decided to record an entire album of Shaver's songs.
Atkins was reluctant to record the material of an unknown writer, but since he had creative control, Jennings decided to record the album. Jennings later recalled, "His songs were of a piece, and the only way you could ever understand Billy Joe was to hear his whole body of work. That was how the concept of "Honky Tonk Heroes" came about. Billy Joe talked the way a modern cowboy would speak, if he stepped out of the West and lived today. He had a command of the Texas lingo, his world as down to earth and real as the day was long, and he wore his Lone Star birthright like a badge." Jennings was also spending more of his time at Tompall Glaser's "Hillbilly Central" studio in Nashville. Jennings was attracted by the loose atmosphere of the studio in comparison to RCA Records'. Jennings brought Glaser with him to RCA Victor Studios to co-produce "Honky Tonk Heroes". "Tompall and I were best friends," Jennings reminisced in his autobiography "Waylon". "We met at about the time he broke up with his brothers, and I kind of took their place in his life." Jennings and Shaver worked on the songs for several weeks, with Shaver believing that Jennings was not closely following the phrasing of the tunes, and in some cases he played the songs repeatedly so that Jennings would understand them. The title cut was especially problematic, as Jennings and Shaver clashed over the arrangement. Jennings's drummer, Richie Albright, later recalled: "We were doing the album and Billy Joe was around, and we began 'Honky Tonk Heroes,' so we cut the first part of the song and we stopped, and Waylon said, 'This is the way we're going to do it.' And Billy Joe had been sitting in the back and he come walking up, saying, 'What are you doing? You're fucking up my song. That ain't the way it goes.' Pretty soon Waylon and Billy Joe are just hollering at one another. Billy Joe didn't understand the way we were putting it together...then we put it together and he said, 'Yeah. That's good. That's the way it goes.
Jennings and Shaver co-wrote the song "You Asked Me To" at Bobby Bare's office. Atkins' only input was his suggestion to add the song "We Had it All", which had previously been a top ten single. "We Had It All" had been written by Kris Kristofferson's keyboardist "Funky" Donnie Fritts. RCA requested Jennings to add a song not written by Shaver to improve the chances of commercial success for the album's single. Jennings initially considered Steve Young's "Seven Bridges Road," Jimmie Rodgers' "T for Texas," and Shel Silverstein's "The Leaving Coming On".
Release and critical reception.
Initially, the executives of RCA Records, and Chet Atkins, tried to avoid releasing the album. "We Had it All" was released as a single and it peaked at number 28 in "Billboard"s Country Singles. Also released as a single, "You Asked Me To" peaked at number eight. "Honky Tonk Heroes" was released in July 1973 to good critical reception. It reached number 14 in "Billboard"s Top Country Albums, while it peaked at number 185 in the "Billboard" 200.
"Rolling Stone" wrote: "After many years of overproduction on record, Waylon Jennings' new album offers an opportunity to hear the crisp, robust no-nonsense sound which has been his trademark since his early days with Buddy Holly's Crickets." "The Music Journal" described the album as "certainly brash, lively and down-to-earth. Thoroughly infectious too." Regarding the composition of the songs, "Stereo Review" wrote: "Billy Joe Shaver songs have [Jennings] in a corral if not in a box...This is like picking Kris Kristofferson up by the literary ankles, shaking him vigorously, and using every damn nugget that tumbles out."
The "Chicago Tribune" opened its review by discussing Jennings's recent performances at The Troubadour and the Shower of Stars Concert, and his change of looks. The publication remarked that the singer appeared "raising his country consciousness but good: longish straggly hair, beginnings of a beard, black leather, laid back". For the reviewer "Honky Tonk Heroes" signified a "testimony to Jennings' directional attitude", as she considered the album "a pretty powerful example of both the old and 'new' Waylon", as the reviewers noted the change of looks reflected on the cover and the "music typical of the 'old' talent". Jennings was considered to be a "strong, vaguely sensitive singer " with a style "capable of crossing country lines to find wider acceptance". The piece opined that Shaver "deserves more recognition that he's so far received". It called his songs "simple, sometimes reminiscent of Mickey Newbury's in their gentle regret or dont-give-a-damn exuberance", as the review concluded that "They are songs of contemporary cowboys looking for a freedom they're never going to find".
For the "Austin American-Statesman", reviewer Townsend Miller deemed the album a combination of his "favorite singer" in Jennings and the what he previously considered the "album of the year" on Shaver's release "Old Five and Dimers Like Me". The reviewer recommended the readers to purchase both albums. "El Paso Times" opined that "Honky Tonk Heroes" "holds some of the best poetic humor and downright country sounds". The "Baltimore Sun" declared it "country music at its best". For "The Kansas City Star", it offered "straight C&amp;W minus the show biz pretension". The review called the songs "dusty, gritty and above all, honest", as it concluded that they were "like that first beer after a long day in the saddle".
Legacy.
"Honky Tonk Heroes" added to the "outlaw" image of Jennings, and the album is considered important in the development of the outlaw subgenre in country music. Shaver, who was regarded as a major contributor to the subgenre, considered the album "the touchstone of the Outlaw movement".
The album was reissued on CD in 1994 by RCA Records. Buddah Records reissued it on CD in 1999, while RCA records later reissued the album on LP, CD and digital download through Fat Possum Records in 2013.
Retrospective reviews.
Stephen Thomas Erlewine in a retrospective review in AllMusic felt that Jennings had been looking for a musical approach which had roots in country and rock, and Shaver's songs – "sketching an outlaw stance with near defiance and borrowing rock attitude to create the hardest country tunes imaginable" – provided that common ground. Erlewine believed that the album arrived at the right moment to revive the honky tonk music of Nashville by injecting a rock and roll attitude that would produce outlaw country.
Kenneth Burns, in Robert Dimery's "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die", says that "Honky Tonk Heroes" is "one of country music's landmark albums", and points out Jennings' rock and roll roots as bass player for Buddy Holly. In 2013 author Michael Streissguth wrote, "The album christened country music's outlaw era...and bathed in risk, having gambled on the work of an untested songwriter."

Itō Jinsai

, who also went by the pen name Keisai, was a Japanese Confucian philosopher. He is considered to be one of the most influential Confucian scholars of seventeenth century Japan, and the Tokugawa period (1600–1868) generally, his teachings flourishing especially in Kyoto and the Kansai area through the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate.
Jinsai's school, known as the Kogigaku, criticized the teachings of Song dynasty Chinese philosopher Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130–1200) and instead advocated a philosophical vision based on an understanding of the meanings of key terms in the "Analects" and the "Mencius". His school has been considered part of a larger movement, Kogaku ("ancient learning'), including earlier scholars such as Yamaga Sokō 山鹿素行 (1622–1685), and later thinkers such as Ogyū Sorai 荻生徂徠 (1666–1728). However, Jinsai never mentions Sokō or his ideas, and Jinsai's own statements of philosophical meaning were strongly and systematically criticized by Sorai. Rather than as a thinker aligned with the so-called Kogaku movement, Jinsai's ideas are best understood on their own terms. Jinsai is widely known for his outspoken affirmation of the validity of human emotions, and his articulation of a metaphysics highlighting the pervasiveness and infinite creative potential of a "unitary generative force" (Jpn: "ichigenki"). Indicative of his renown in the larger world of East Asian philosophy, Jinsai's writings have frequently been compared to those of the Qing dynasty scholar Dai Zhen 戴震 (1724–1777), whose key work, "Mengzi ziyi shuzheng" ("The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the" Mencius) is very similar in theme and method to Jinsai's opus, the "Gomō jigi" ("The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the" Analects "and" Mencius).
Life.
Jinsai was born the eldest son of a Kyoto merchant, Itō Ryōshitsu. It is not clear exactly what merchant activities the family was engaged in, however. He began studying Chinese from an early age and devoted himself to Zhu Xi's expression of Song dynasty Neo-Confucianism. He continued to study Confucianism throughout his teens, going over old books his uncle had left his father.
By the age of ten, he was studying under his uncle, a noted physician who had once treated the emperor Go-Yōzei. He also likely studied with Matsunaga Sekigo, a Kyoto-based Neo-Confucian scholar who had in turn studied with Fujiwara Seika. Given the distinctively Kyoto lineage of Jinsai's learning, there are good reasons for interpreting it as an expression of the philosophical world of the ancient imperial capital.
Itō suffered from an unidentified illness when he was twenty-eight and left the family business to his younger brother. Afterwards he became a recluse, studying Buddhism and Daoism. During this time he began to have his first doubts over Zhu Xi's philosophy, even changing his pen name which showed his commitment to humaneness ("jin").
He later established a private school, the Kogidō, in Kyoto in 1662. Following Jinsai's death in 1705, leadership at the Kogidō was assumed by his son, Tōgai (1670–1736). The Kogidō was located on the east bank of the Horikawa River, directly across from the school of Yamazaki Ansai. During his lifetime, Ansai became a major proponent of Zhu Xi's version of Song Neo-Confucian thought. Jinsai's school, in contrast, offered a sustained critique of Zhu Xi's ideas. Especially in Kyoto, Jinsai's school met with great success, attracting three thousand students from many different classes and professions.
Teachings.
Jinsai formed his own understanding of Confucian philosophy after coming to realize that Zhu Xi's speculative philosophy of was not practical in everyday ethics. Instead, he felt one could learn the way of the sages through an understanding of the meanings of words in the "Analects" and the "Mencius", two of the Four Books that Zhu Xi's philosophy had elevated to nearly canonical status within the broad field of East Asian Confucianism. The other two of the Four Books, "The Doctrine of the Mean" and the "Great Learning", were originally chapters from the Book of Rites (Chinese: Liji), that had been treated as separate volumes, with significant emendations, by Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi. It was largely on the basis of the latter two writings that Zhu Xi in particular had articulated some of his most distinctive Neo-Confucian ideas. In response to Zhu Xi's textual alterations, Jinsai argued, in a very distinctive manner, that "the Great Learning was not a surviving work of the Confucian School", not simply rejecting Zhu Xi's claims on particular points, but in an across the board manner dismissing the text as "not Confucian" in any significant respect. Instead of the "Great Learning", Jinsai's approach was to focus on an explanation of the meanings of philosophical terms as discussed in the "Analects" and the "Mencius". Jinsai's approach to Confucian scholarship is today known as "kogigaku" or "study of ancient meanings". This approach was taken up by later Confucian scholars, particularly Ogyū Sorai.
In significant respects, Jinsai can be seen as advancing the Neo-Confucian project that Zhu Xi, his chief philosophical adversary, had otherwise so effectively and persuasively championed. For example, Jinsai's most comprehensive philosophical text, the "Gomō jigi" ("The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the" Analects "and" Mencius), was first recorded as Jinsai was giving a series of lectures on Chen Beixi's 陳北溪 (1156–1223) "Xingli ziyi" 性理字義 ("The Meanings of Neo-Confucian Philosophical Terms"). Much of the philosophical structure of Jinsai's "Gomō jigi" as well as its methodology of conceptual clarification and analysis clearly derive from Beixi's work. The two texts even share common elements in their titles, "jigi" and "ziyi" 字義 (Jpn: "jigi") being written with the same characters, referring to the meanings of words. In both cases, however, the words that were discussed and defined were distinctively philosophical terms such as "tendō" (the way of heaven), "tenmei" (the decree of heaven), "michi" (the way), "sei" (human nature), "kokoro" (the mind and heart), "kotowari" (principle), "kishin" (ghosts and spirits), and many others.
Jinsai is often described as an apolitical philosopher. However, the "Gomō jigi" can easily be seen as an inherently political text, one which defines the very philosophical foundations of an ideal political order. In the "Analects", 13/3, Confucius, when asked by a disciple what he would do if given political authority, replied that he would "rectify terms" ("zheng ming"). When his disciple responded with bewilderment, Confucius explained that if words were not used correctly, then in effect there could be little hope for order in a state. For that reason, Confucius added, the prince is always careful in his use of words. Jinsai's project of defining philosophical terms rightly is very much a later day expression of Confucius' view that in order to govern effectively, one must ensure that words are understood and used correctly. If that is not done, then all will be lost.
Jinsai had several fundamental philosophical disagreements with Zhu Xi, the premier interpreter of Confucian thought since the late-Song dynasty. For one, Zhu Xi had claimed that human nature is inherently good. Jinsai disagreed and instead argued it had the potential to become good, but only through daily practice and deeds can this potential be realized. Additionally, he rejected the dualism of rational principal ("li") and material force ("qi") proposed by Song Confucianism, believing it was material force alone that led to the creation of life and all things.
Furthermore, Zhu Xi connected the way of heaven ("tendō") with the human way ("jindō") through rational principal. Jinsai on the other hand saw the way ("michi") as being embedded in the common and everyday, and not ensconced on some elevated plane as Zhu had suggested. To Jinsai, the central question was how one should conduct oneself in everyday life. Zhu Xi affirmed that all humans are born with an "original human nature" ("sei"), which is naturally good. Jinsai, however, rejected this.
Rather than the essential goodness of human nature, Jinsai stressed natural human emotions ("ninjō"), which he found in everyday life. Extending from this came the importance that was placed on poetry which allowed for the expression of human emotions. This, he believed, provided a needed release of emotions and desires. Song Confucianism he felt too much advocated seriousness and a restraint of human nature. His support for literature even led to the Kogidō attracting some students more interested in Chinese poetry than his Confucian teachings.
Although often grouped with the Edo Confucian scholar, Ogyū Sorai, as a proponent of the ancient learning movement, Jinsai's singlemost harsh critic was none other than Sorai. In a letter written to Jinsai, Sorai early on expressed admiration for the Kyoto philosopher and an interest in his philosophy, having read a pirated edition of Jinsai's "Gomō jigi" published long before Jinsai was ready for it to be released in its final form. Jinsai never responded to Sorai, apparently wounding his pride deeply. Whatever Sorai might have made of Jinsai's silence, it is clear that in Sorai's later writings, in the "Bendō" and "Benmei" (1728) in particular, Sorai takes issue with Jinsai on nearly every count, often criticizing him harshly as in effect no different in philosophical doctrine than the thinker he supposedly was criticizing, Zhu Xi.
In the later writings of the Kaitokudō, a merchant academy based in Osaka, Jinsai found a succession of defenders who returned Sorai's critiques with a series of harsh responses to Sorai's own philosophical statements.

1017 Jacqueline

1017 Jacqueline ("prov. designation": "or" ) is a dark background asteroid from the central regions of the asteroid belt. It was discovered on 4 February 1924, by Russian-French astronomer Benjamin Jekhowsky at the Algiers Observatory, Algeria, in North Africa. The carbonaceous C-type asteroid has a rotation period of 7.87 hours with a high brightness amplitude of 0.6 magnitude and measures approximately in diameter. It was named after the French physicist and long-time pupil of the discoverer, Jacqueline Zadoc-Kahn Eisenmann (1904–1998).
Orbit and classification.
"Jacqueline" is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the intermediate asteroid belt at a distance of 2.4–2.8 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,536 days; semi-major axis of 2.61 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid's earliest preserved observation dates back to 7 March 1924 at Heidelberg Observatory, where the body's observation arc begins in February 1928, nearly four years after its official discovery observation at Algiers–Bouzaréah.
Naming.
This minor planet was named after Jacqueline Zadoc-Kahn Eisenmann (1904–1998), a French physicist and long-time student of Jekhowsky's. The was mentioned in "The Names of the Minor Planets" by Paul Herget in 1955 ().
Physical characteristics.
In the Bus–Binzel SMASS classification, "Jacqueline" is a common, carbonaceous C-type asteroid.
Rotation period.
In May 2000, a rotational lightcurve of "Jacqueline" was obtained from photometric observations by American photometrist Robert Stephens at the Santana Observatory in California. Analysis of the classically shaped bimodal lightcurve gave a well-defined rotation period of hours and a brightness variation of magnitude, indicative of a non-spheroidal shape (). Other measurements by Eric Barbotin and by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory gave a similar period of 7.873 and 7.875 hours with an amplitude of 0.72 and 0.43 magnitude, respectively ().
In 2016, a lightcurve was published using modeled photometric data from the Lowell Photometric Database. It gave a concurring sidereal period of 7.87149 hours, as well as two spin axes of (7.0°, 55.0°) and (170.0°, 65.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β).
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, "Jacqueline" measures (), () and () kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of (), () and (), respectively. The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" derives an albedo of 0.0497 and a diameter of 37.61 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.0.
Alternative mean-diameter measurements published by the WISE team include (), (), (), () and () with corresponding albedos of (), (), (), () and ().

<doc id="6994524" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6994524" title="Weapons Storage and Security System">
Weapons Storage and Security System

Weapons Storage and Security System (WS3) is a system including electronic controls and vaults built into the floors of Protective Aircraft Shelters (PAS) on several NATO military airfields all over the world. These vaults are used for safe special weapons storage, typically of tactical B61 nuclear bombs. Historically the system was also called within NATO the Weapon Security and Survivability System (WS3) or Weapons Survivability and Security System.
History.
During the Cold War in Europe, US and NATO bases used by the Quick Reaction Alert readiness forces stored their nuclear bombs in heavily secured weapon storage areas located on or in the vicinity of the base. The process of transferring and mounting the weapons to the aircraft took several hours and required a large coordinated team of security, transportation and engineer personnel; when the alert or exercise was called off, it took an equal amount of time and trouble to return the weapons to the bunkers. 
The standard system had functioned since the late 1940s, but was unsatisfactory for overseas duty in multiple regards: primarily, it required the weapons be kept mounted on the body of the alert aircraft to ensure they could take off quickly enough when called (despite aircraft not being designed to safely or securely store nuclear weapons). Secondarily, it also posed an OPSEC risk, as any large amount of activity around the weapons bunkers during a time of crisis would be quickly spotted by the Soviets and interpreted as a prelude to nuclear attack. Lastly, there was a serious risk that wartime damage to airbases from a first strike using nuclear airburst or persistent chemical weapons attack would deny access to the bunkers for many weeks without actually destroying them, thus creating a much-feared "soft kill" scenario in which most of NATO's theater-based nuclear assets could be rapidly neutralized by a much smaller number of Soviet "soft" area denial strikes. In a projected multi-day war, this was feared to be a decisive handicap.
Deployment of the WS3 system was authorized in 1988, and they were in widespread use by 1995.
Specifications.
The WS3 system consists of a Weapons Storage Vault (WSV) and electronic monitoring and control systems built into the concrete floor of a specially-secured Hardened Aircraft Shelter. One vault can hold up to four nuclear weapons and in the lowered position provides ballistic protection through its hardened lid and reinforced sidewalls. The WS3 system allows storage directly underneath the aircraft intended to carry the bombs, eliminating the need to both store the weapons on the aircraft or to wait for them to be transferred from external bunkers. Very few personnel are needed to operate the unit, and the loading process can be completed in minutes with just a few armorers and no vehicles needed.
The electronic systems include various classified sensors, along with electronic data-transmission and security equipment such as video, motion detectors, closed circuit TV and thermal imaging devices, thus making the WS3 shelters more secure against sabotage and infiltration compared to existing igloo-style bunkers.
Deployment.
215 WS3 vaults were built for the United States Air Forces in Europe at 13 sites in seven countries. Additionally 34 WS3 vaults were built for the Royal Air Force to store the WE.177 nuclear bomb; 10 at RAF Brüggen in Germany and 24 at RAF Marham in Britain.

1018 Arnolda

1018 Arnolda, provisional designation , is a stony asteroid from the central regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 16 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 3 March 1924, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named after physicist Arnold Berliner.
Classification and orbit.
"Arnolda" is not a member of any known asteroid family. It orbits the Sun in the central main belt at a distance of 1.9–3.2 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,480 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.25 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins nine days prior to its official discovery observation at Heidelberg.
Physical characteristics.
"Arnolda" is an assumed stony S-type asteroid, a very common type in the inner and in parts of the central asteroid belt.
Lightcurves.
In May 2005, the best-rated rotational lightcurve of "Arnolda" was obtained from photometric observations by Australian astronomers at the Oakley Southern Sky Observatory (). Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 14.617 hours with a brightness variation of 0.33 magnitude (). Several other astronomers obtained number of lesser-rated lightcurves with a shorter period ().
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, "Arnolda" measures between 13.68 and 16.557 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.29 and 0.439.
The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" derives a high albedo of 0.3760 and a diameter of 16.44 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.60.
Naming.
This minor planet was named after physicist Arnold Berliner (1862–1942), on the occasion of his 70th birthday in 1933. Berliner was the editor of the prominent German periodical scientific magazine "Naturwissenschaften" ().

Fakt

Fakt (, Polish for "fact") is a Polish tabloid daily newspaper published in Warsaw, Poland, by Ringier Axel Springer Polska (a Swiss-German joint-venture subsidiary of Axel Springer SE and Ringier), and is one of the best-selling papers in Poland.
History and profile.
"Fakt" was launched in October 2003 by the Polish outlet of the German publisher Axel Springer AG, and modeled on Springer's German tabloid "Bild", the biggest-selling newspaper in Europe. Like its German counterpart, "Fakt" is characterized by its down-market, often sensationalist journalism with a populist appeal. However, politically it is by and large centrist. The paper supported policies of the former prime minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, a regular commentator. Other op-ed writers include journalist Tomasz Lis, former TVN anchorman Kamil Durczok, and former "Rzeczpospolita" columnist Maciej Rybiński.
In the early 2000s, "Fakt" had a weekly supplement contrasting to its tabloid content, "Europa" which featured essays by scholars and intellectuals including Niall Ferguson, Francis Fukuyama, Jürgen Habermas, and Robert Kagan.
In 2003, the circulation of "Fakt" was 715,000 copies making it the best-selling newspaper in Poland. Since its launch, "Fakt" replaced the middle-market "Gazeta Wyborcza" as Poland's biggest-selling newspaper, also putting pressure on the older national tabloid "Super Express". In 2005, to compete directly with "Fakt", "Gazeta Wyborcza" publisher Agora responded with a failed middle-market paper "Nowy Dzień".
When "Fakt" was launched at a price of 1 złoty, "Super Express" publisher Media Express sued Axel Springer for dumping, however having lost the lawsuit, it leveled the price of "Super Express" to equal "Fakt".
Criticism.
Like "Bild" and other tabloids, "Fakt" has been subjected to criticism concerning its style of journalism from media watchdogs. The Polish Journalists Association awarded "Fakt" twice with a "Hyena of the Year" award, for "a particular unscrupulousness and neglect of the principles of the journalistic work ethics." 
In 2004, "Fakt" published a photograph showing the nude dead body of a murder victim. 
In 2005, it published the photo of Stanisław Piguła, the editor-in-chief of at the time, with the caption "This sex offender is at large." The story was about a different man, not Piguła. The Warsaw-Praga District Court ordered Grzegorz Jankowski, the editor-in-chief of "Fakt", to compensate Piguła and to publish apologies in each day's edition of "Fakt", "Gazeta Wyborcza", and for the week following the issuing of the ruling. The court stipulated that the apology should take up at least a quarter of the front page of the newspapers. Piguła donated all of his compensation to the palliative care unit of the Konin Voivodeship Combined Hospital.
In 2015, "Fakt" published an photo of a dying ten year old girl that had been attacked with an axe outside a bookstore in Kamienna Góra, and sustained severe wounds to her head. The girl died of her injuries a few hours after the picture was taken.
In 2018, "Fakt" published an article titled "The father chose politics and the son [chose] a rope" () about the suicide of former Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller's son, Leszek Miller Junior. The editor-in-chief of "Fakt", Robert Feluś, apologized. Leszek Miller sued "Fakt" and Faluś for "the gross violation" of Miller and his immediate family's personal rights.

Mene (goddess)

Mene (, ), in ancient Greek religion and mythology, is an epithet of Selene, the Greek lunar goddess as a goddess presiding over the months.
Etymology.
The Greek word ("mēnē") means both the Moon and the lunar month. It represents the feminine form of the older masculine noun ("mēn"), which in turn derives from the oblique stem of the Indo-European word "*meh₁nōt" ("moon; month")."" The name of the Phrygian moon-god Men derives from the same word"." Further cognates include "Moon" and "Máni." 
William Smith writes of Mene as "a goddess presiding over the months". Apostolos Athanassakis and Benjamin Wolkow speculate that Selene's name, which is derived from the word ("selas," "light") and thus means "luminous one", might have originally developed as a euphemism, before becoming the Moon and its goddess's proper name.

Chase Miller

Eldon Chase Miller (born January 28, 1987) is an American former stock car racing driver, who last competed in the NASCAR Nationwide Series (now the Xfinity Series) in 2013. He currently works for Front Row Motorsports as a mechanic.
Racing career.
2005–2008: Dodge development driver.
Miller joined the ARCA Re/Max Series in 2005 at age 18 as a driver in Dodge's driver development program, He made his debut at Nashville driving the Bobby Jones Racing No. 88 car, where he ran in the top-five for a part of the race before running out of gas. Then, at Gateway, Miller led multiple laps before falling out due to transmission trouble. In 2006, Miller was tapped by Dodge to drive for the larger Cunningham Motorsports team in their No. 4 in six ARCA races that year. After an 11th-place finish at Nashville, Miller charged to the win at Pocono. He set the record as the youngest driver to ever win an ARCA race at Pocono to that point. He then backed up his win with a dominating performance at the second annual ARCA Pocono event before a cylinder failure took him from the lead, with only eight laps remaining, and forced him to a fifth-place finish. He also qualified on the pole at Gateway and was leading the race when more mechanical problems plagued him. His outstanding performance won him the opportunity to compete in the Craftsman Truck Series with the Dodge Development Team.
Miller joined up with Bobby Hamilton Racing to drive their No. 4 truck near the end of the 2006 season, also as a part of the Dodge driver development program. In only his fourth start, Miller scored a top ten at Martinsville Speedway. He earned the ride for the full season in 2007. However, after five races, Miller and BHR parted ways. He was soon hired by Ray Evernham to drive a part-time schedule in his Busch Series team's No. 9 car. In only his second career start, Miller scored a second-place qualifying effort at Kentucky Speedway, and a best finish of fifteenth at Gateway. In 2008, he ran twelve races in the No. 9 car once again, with sponsorship from Unilever and Verizon Wireless, as well as two additional races in the No. 19 car for Evernham. He had two top-ten finishes and finished 38th in points in a part-time schedule. 
2009–2013: Start and park career.
Gillett Evernham closed their Nationwide Series team at the end of the year after the team's merger with Petty Enterprises, and Miller spent the first few months of the 2009 season without a ride, before he drove most of the second half of the season, going back and forth between the No. 91 MSRP Motorsports Chevrolet and the JTG Daugherty Racing No. 47 Toyota. He also ran one race at Memphis in Derrike Cope's No. 73. For 2010, Miller filled in for David Gilliland in the standalone races in the No. 91 for D'Hondt-Humphrey Motorsports (formerly MSRP). He also drove a few races for other teams that year as well, which were Specialty Racing in the No. 61 and MacDonald Motorsports in the No. 82. All three rides were start and park entries. 
After running one race for Fleur-de-lis Motorsports in their No. 68, Miller found a solid ride about a third of the way into the 2011 season, driving the start-and-park No. 46 for Key Motorsports. He entered every race for the rest of the year starting at Iowa in May. He moved to two of Key's other cars for two races, with him in the No. 40 for Nashville and in the No. 42 for Montreal. In 2012, Miller drove for The Motorsports Group in the No. 46, start-and-parking for most of the season. At the start of 2013, he returned to start-and-park the TMG No. 46 for select races, but then left for TriStar Motorsports during the year, starting-and-parking in the team's No. 10 and No. 91 cars as well as in the No. 15 car for Rick Ware Racing.
2014–present: Crew member career.
2013 was the last time that Miller was a driver. However, he remained employed at TriStar as a car chief for their No. 14 car of Eric McClure and Cale Conley and later a mechanic and crew chief for the team. According to his LinkedIn profile, in May 2015, he became TriStar's shop foreman, and after TriStar's Nationwide/Xfinity team was shut down in 2017, Miller joined Front Row Motorsports, where he currently works as a wiring mechanic.
Personal life.
Miller graduated from Sequoyah High School.. Also according to his LinkedIn, he is a graduate of Mitchell Community College.

Everyday (Dave Matthews Band song)

"Everyday" is the closing track and third radio single from Dave Matthews Band's album "Everyday". It reached #38 on Modern Rock Tracks, and #8 on Adult Top 40. A live version of "Everyday" is featured on the Dave Matthews Band compilation album "The Best of What's Around Vol. 1". The song evolved from an earlier DMB song entitled "#36" and references The Beatles' song "All You Need Is Love".
When the song is played live, "#36" is mixed in with "Everyday." It is also a tradition for the crowd to sing, "Honey Honey come and dance with me" during the parts of the song that #36 mixes in with. This can be heard on such CDs as "The Best of What's Around Vol. 1", "Live Trax Vol. 6", "The Gorge", "Live at Folsom Field, Boulder, Colorado", and on "Weekend on the Rocks".
An acoustic version of the song was played live on February 28, 2001 by Dave Matthews and Trey Anastasio during the latter's solo performance at the Landmark Theatre in Richmond, Virginia.
On September 21, 2001, Dave Matthews played an acoustic version of the song as part of the concert, performed in remembrance of the victims of the September 11 attacks.
The song was not originally supposed to be the third single from the album. "When the World Ends" was originally supposed to be the single, but after 9/11 it was thought that the dark title would not be appropriate.
The song has enjoyed consistent popularity as a live staple and has been played live every year since its release (2001–2018). As of 2018, it has been the most played live song from the "Everyday" album.
Music video.
A music video for the song was concepted and directed by then TBWA\Chiat\Day North America creative director Chuck McBride, cinematographed by Lance Acord and produced by Tim Harman through New York production company cYclops in 2001. It features actor Judah Friedlander walking around hugging people (mostly in the band's hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia and Greenwich Village), including Conan O'Brien, Vincent Pastore, Sheryl Crow, Blue Man Group, Tiki Barber and Hallie Kate Eisenberg, as well as the band themselves. The video is a response to the general feeling immediately following the September 11th attacks.
In popular culture.
The song was parodied by Jimmy Fallon in his opening act for the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards.
The song was featured in the third episode of "The Paper", after Alex and his new girlfriend kiss for the first time at a Dave Matthews Band concert.
In its original form as "#36" the song was written in response to the assassination of Chris Hani, who worked to end South African apartheid.
The 2006 "Free Hugs Campaign" video, which spawned the eponymous social movement, features an Australian man using the pseudonym Juan Mann offering unconditional hugs to strangers.

1019 Strackea

1019 Strackea, provisional designation , is a stony Hungaria asteroid of the inner asteroid belt, approximately 8 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 3 March 1924, by astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. It is named for German astronomer Gustav Stracke.
Classification and orbit.
"Strackea" is a member of the Hungaria group, a dynamical group forming the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. It is, however, a non-family asteroid of the background population, and not a member of the (collisional) Hungaria family. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–2.0 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (965 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 27° with respect to the ecliptic.
The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Heidelberg in 1924.
Physical characteristics.
In the Tholen classification, "Strackea" is a common, stony S-type asteroid.
Lightcurve.
The first valid rotational lightcurve of "Strackea" with a period of 4.05 hours and a brightness variation of 0.17 magnitude was obtained by French amateur astronomer Laurent Bernasconi in February 2006 (). Since then, several well-defined lightcurves with a period between 4.044 and 4.052 hours and an amplitude of 0.15 to 0.25 magnitude were obtained by astronomers Brian Warner, Richard Schmidt, as well as by the group of astronomers Pierre Antonini, Raoul Behrend, Roberto Crippa and Federico Manzini ().
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, "Strackea" measures between 7.169 and 8.79 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.206 and 0.39. The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.2236 and a diameter of 8.37 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.63.
Naming.
This minor planet was named after German astronomer Gustav Stracke (1887–1943), who was in charge of the minor planet department at the Berlin-based Astronomical Calculation Institute, despite his wish that he not be honored in this fashion. Previously, the discoverer had circumvented Stracke's wish by accordingly naming a consecutively numbered sequence of asteroids, so that their first letters form the name "G. Stracke". These minor planets, in the , were:
Naming citation was first published by Paul Herget in "The Names of the Minor Planets" in 1955 ().

Eoin Bradley

Eoin Bradley (commonly known by his nickname Skinner; born 31 December 1983) is a Gaelic footballer and association footballer. He plays the former for the Glenullin club and, previously, for the Derry county team. With Glenullin he won a Derry Senior Football Championship and with Derry he won a National League title.
Bradley usually plays corner forward for both club and county – often paired in a two-man inside forward line with brother Patsy, but has also played in the half-forward line. He is known for his pace, point and goal scoring abilities, and runs through opposing teams' defence. His "reckless adventure" and liability to do the unexpected is also part of his effectiveness. Although a great talent, in the past he has been criticised for some of his shot selections from acute angles. However, since 2011 his decision-making in front of goal has improved, which has put down to manager John Brennan.
Personal life.
Bradley's family is from Glenullin near Garvagh, with Eoin himself now living in Kilrea. Eoin plays football for glenullin but he has never lived there. He went to secondary school at St. Pat's College in Maghera.
His brother Paddy and cousin Gerard O'Kane both also play for Derry. His father Liam is former manager of Antrim. Eoin's uncle Gabriel Bradley won the Ulster Championship twice with Derry in 1975 and 1976.
Bradley was banned from driving motor vehicles for 16 months after consuming three times the drink drive limit and crashing into a parked car. After the crash, he fought with the owner of the car then went into the bar and continued drinking.
On one occasion he received a six-match ban for head butting a player on an opposing team.
He has also been found guilty in a court of law in Limavady of punching referee Declan O'Connor in the face. He was bound over to keep the peace for two years, fined £500 and ordered to pay £500 compensation to O'Connor.
In 2017, Glenullin refused to play a league match against The Loup, citing ill feeling towards referee Declan O'Connor who had previously reported Bradley for assault. This cost the club three league points.
In 2020, Bradley received a six-match ban for urinating on the sidelines of the Windsor Park pitch during an Irish Cup semi-final.
Bradley was sole director of MM Builders Ltd. He was fined £190,456.70 over tax affairs. HMRC listed him in their list of "deliberate tax defaulters". The list, which is published several times a year, identifies companies and individuals who have received penalties for either deliberate errors in their tax returns or failure to comply with their tax obligations. Media contacted MM Builders Ltd about the penalty but there was no comment from the firm.
In May 2025, Bradley was banned for driving for 2 months for speeding in his car. District Judge Nigel Broderick said the defendant had a "poor driving record". Bradley already had 9 penalty points on his driving license at this stage and narrowly avoided a harsher punishment. 
Gaelic football career.
Club.
Bradley plays club football for John Mitchel's Glenullin. Up until the age of 14 he played as a goalkeeper and it wasn't until Under 16 level that he played in the forwards.
Bradley has played for the Glenullin Senior team since 15 years old. He won the Derry Senior Football Championship with Glenullin in 2007. Glenullin met Bellaghy in the final and after a replay, won the title. Bradley was man of the match in the drawn final against Bellaghy. "Irish News" journalist Paddy Heaney described him as the "player who ripped the Blues apart" over the course of the two games.
Earlier that year Glenullin won the Ulster Senior Club Football League, beating Latton of Monaghan in the final. The club reached the Ulster League final again the following year, but were defeated by fellow Derry club Ballinderry.
In 2008 the club reached the final of the All-Ireland Sevens Championship, organised by Kilmacud Crokes. They were however beaten 1–11 to 0–13 by St. Gall's of Antrim in the decider, with Bradley scoring 0–05 in the match. He was favourite for player of the tournament which eventually went to one of his St Gall's opponents. Glenullin, jointly with Ballinderry won the 2008 Derry Senior Football League.
Manager Brian McIver permitted Bradley to play for Derry while also playing association football for Glenavon. However, Bradley's name was omitted from Damian Barton's 43-man training panel in October 2015, with the inclusion of injured duo Mark Lynch and Kevin Johnston being taken to mean Bradley would not be included later.
His inter-county career seemed to be over by 2017 or 2020.
Inter-county.
Bradley was first called up to the Derry Senior panel in 2004 by Mickey Moran. He made his debut in the Dr. McKenna Cup against Antrim, but suffered a horrific leg break against Jordanstown in the next outing and was out for a year and a half.
Bradley and Derry reached the Dr. McKenna Cup final in 2005, where they were beaten by Tyrone. His Championship debut came later that year, when he came off the bench against Monaghan. He had an impressive 2005 Championship campaign, including scoring a brilliant solo goal against Down in the Qualifiers. He collected the ball inside his own half, ran half the pitch evading four tackles and blasted the ball into the top corner of the net.
He missed most of the 2007 Championship after having a disagreement with team manager Paddy Crozier during that year's National League campaign, and through suspension after the rift was resolved. His solitary 2007 Championship game was a substitute appearance against Dublin in the All-Ireland quarter-final. He came on as a sub and managed to score an excellent point in the defeat, but missed two attempts on goal which may have altered the result.
Derry were once again beaten in the 2008 Dr. McKenna Cup final, this time by Down. He was instrumental in the 2008 National League, which Derry won, defeating Kerry in the final. The league success saw Derry become favourites to win the Ulster Championship and one of the top few for the All-Ireland. However, despite a good opening Ulster Championship victory over Donegal, Derry exited the Ulster Championship against Fermanagh at the semi-final stage, due to his pre-match meal and were defeated by Monaghan in the first round of the Qualifiers. Bradley scored 1–01 in each of the games. His goal against Fermanagh was a particularly amazing goal – rounding Peter Sherry, running 40 metres before blasting a shot past Fermanagh goalkeeper Ronan Gallagher.
Bradley and Derry also reached the National League final in 2009, but were defeated by Kerry. He captained the side in the group game against Donegal.
Province.
Bradley was named by manager Joe Kernan in the Ulster panel for the 2008 Railway Cup.
Association football career.
Ballymoney United &amp; Coleraine.
At the age of 29, Bradley ventured into association football with NIFL Championship 2 side Ballymoney United, and joined Coleraine in the NIFL Premiership shortly after.
Glenavon.
After a successful top-flight debut campaign, scoring 12 goals in 27 games for the Bannsiders, Bradley moved to newly-crowned Irish Cup winners Glenavon in the summer of 2014. He won his first Irish Cup, and Glenavon's second in three seasons, after defeating Linfield 2-0 in the 2016 final.
Return to Coleraine.
Having experienced a period of indifferent form in his third season at Glenavon, Bradley was sold back to Coleraine in January 2017. Bradley won the Irish Cup for a second time in 2018, as Coleraine claimed a 3-1 victory over Cliftonville, with Bradley scoring the third late in the game.
In 2020, Bradley received a six-match ban for urinating on the sidelines of the Windsor Park pitch during an Irish Cup semi-final.
Return to Glenavon.
Following his release by Coleraine, it was announced on 27 June 2022 that Bradley had returned to Glenavon on a one-year deal, with the option of a further year.
Portadown.
On 30 July 2023, it was announced that Bradley had joined Portadown upon the expiry of his contract with Glenavon. Bradley would depart the club in January 2024, having scored 2 goals in 9 appearances, with the goals coming against Institute and Dergview. Following his release, he joined Ballymena &amp; Provincial Football League side Desertmartin on 26 January 2024.

Concordia University massacre

The Concordia University massacre was a school shooting on August 24, 1992, in which Valery I. Fabrikant, an associate professor of mechanical engineering, killed four colleagues and wounded a staff member at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Overview.
Perpetrator.
Fabrikant was a mechanical engineering associate professor who had worked at Concordia University for 13 years. He had begun as a technician, and long demonstrated disruptive behaviour towards students, staff members and other academics, described as ranging from "undesirable to intolerable", with which the university had struggled to deal. One student claimed in a 1982 filed police report that he had raped her and dislocated her shoulder. In addition, he had presented academic challenges in teaching and supervision. As early as 1989, two people reported him saying, "I know how people get what they want, they shoot a lot of people."
Relations between Fabrikant and the university became increasingly strained in late 1991 and the spring of 1992. Colleagues became alarmed after he turned his aggression upon them. After being denied tenure, Fabrikant charged members of the engineering department with questionable financial dealings and improper credit for research work. Because of his unacceptable behaviour in addition to the charges, he faced dismissal on grounds of the intimidation and harassment of fellow staff members. He was also under a contempt of court charge for behavior in a lawsuit against colleagues regarding credit for professional articles.
Incident.
On August 24, Fabrikant entered the Engineering department at Concordia with three guns and ammunition in his briefcase. In his shooting rampage on the ninth floor of the Henry F. Hall Building, he killed Electrical and Computer Engineering Departmental Chair Phoivos Ziogas and professors Matthew Douglass, Michael Hogben, and Aaron Jaan Saber (known as Jaan Saber). Fabrikant wounded Elizabeth Horwood, a departmental staff secretary. None of the victims were personally involved in the controversy which Fabrikant had started.
Fabrikant was charged with murder and assault, convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He was denied parole in 2015 and again in 2022.
Events.
Around 1:30 p.m. on Monday, August 24, 1992, Fabrikant walked onto the ninth floor of the Henry F. Hall Building. He was carrying a briefcase that contained three handguns (a snub-nosed Smith &amp; Wesson .38-calibre 5-shot revolver, a German-made 6.35mm Meb pistol with a 6-round magazine, and an Argentinian-made 7.65mm Bersa pistol with an 8-round magazine) and a large amount of ammunition.
First he went looking for Dean of Engineering and Computer Science Srikanta Swamy and M.O.M (Sam) Osman (the chair of the mechanical engineering department). Neither were present. Next, he headed to his own office where he was scheduled to meet Michael Hogben, the president of the Concordia University Faculty Association (CUFA). According to police, Hogben attempted to give Fabrikant a letter setting out the conditions under which he would be allowed to visit the CUFA offices. The letter noted Fabrikant's access would be restricted because his behaviour was causing those who worked there "considerable distress". Fabrikant took out his .38 calibre pistol and shot Hogben three times. Hogben fell to the floor and died shortly thereafter.
A faculty colleague, Aaron Jaan Saber, called out from his office nearby. Fabrikant crossed the hall and fired two shots into Saber, who died in the hospital the next day. Back in the hall, heading back to Osman's office again, Fabrikant fired at Elizabeth Horwood, wounding her in the thigh. He worked his way through the ninth floor corridors to the other side of the building and into the office of Phoivos Ziogas (chair of the electrical and computer-engineering department), who was talking with colleague Otto Schwelb. Fabrikant shot Ziogas twice; he died in hospital a month later. He scuffled with Schwelb, who grabbed the pistol. Unaware that Fabrikant had two other guns in his briefcase, Schwelb went back to tend the injured Ziogas.
Urgences-santé forces, led by Paramedic Assistant Chief Anthony DiMonte, coordinated with police using new protocols learned from the 1989 Polytechnique shooting.
Matthew Douglass (a professor of civil engineering known to be close to Dean Swamy), tried to reason with Fabrikant when he arrived at the dean's office. Fabrikant shot him four times, killing him almost instantly.
Fabrikant took a security guard and another professor (George Abdou) hostage, locked himself in an office, and called an emergency operator. He said he had just committed several murders and wanted to talk to a TV reporter. He stayed on the line for an hour. When he briefly put his gun down to adjust the phone, Abdou kicked it away and the security guard overpowered him.
Aftermath.
The university commissioned two Independent Committees of Inquiry to investigate aspects of the August events. In addition, it established task forces to work on internal policy and procedures. In April 1994, the Independent Committee of Inquiry into Academic and Scientific Integrity, headed by H. W. Arthurs, former president of York University, presented their report, entitled "Integrity in Scholarship" (informally known as the "Arthurs Report"). It noted issues at Concordia and other production-driven research institutions. It stated: "We have confirmed the validity of a number of Dr. Fabrikant's more specific allegations" about financial mismanagement and questions about scholarship practices such as article attribution. The report noted that Fabrikant's allegations were not motivated by concern for the public good, however. Instead, they were the "ultimate revenge" of a desperate man who had already tried blackmail and threats against officials.
An independent review was conducted by John Scott Cowan, former faculty association president and former vice-president (administration) of the University of Ottawa, who was commissioned to study Fabrikant's employment history and related human-resource issues at Concordia University. He documented years of behavioural problems by Fabrikant. In addition, he identified problems common to university environments, where disruptive behaviour has sometimes been excused under the mantle of academic freedom and because many of the academics involved had little experience as managers. He noted that often academic administrators were not comfortable as managers and needed additional training as reported in May 1994 on "Lessons from the Fabrikant File" (also known as the "Cowan Report"). His report included recommendations for how the university could improve its internal communication and management of academics and departments.
In their investigation of academic credentials, a journalist team from the "Montreal Gazette" discovered that Fabrikant was not a political dissident as he had claimed. Instead, he had emigrated from the USSR after having been fired from a succession of posts for his threatening and disruptive behaviour.
As a result, Concordia University made a number of changes to its ethics rules and administrative procedures to improve operations, the integrity of scholarship, and management of faculty and staff. In addition, it established conflict-resolution workshops and resources. The university fired Fabrikant 17 days after the rampage.
Fabrikant is serving his sentence at Archambault Prison in Sainte-Anne-Des-Plaines, Quebec. He was denied parole in 2015 and again in 2022.
Legal proceedings.
During his trial, Fabrikant came across as petty, vindictive, unrepentant and vain, along with being rude and hostile to the judges, one of whom he called a "low little crook", and displayed the same attitude to psychiatrists who testified on whether he was sane enough for the proceedings to continue.
During the trial Fabrikant acted as his own lawyer (after firing ten lawyers in the process) and called 75 witnesses for his defense, but in the end it took the jury only seven hours to find him guilty of four charges of first degree murder, attempted murder, and two hostage charges. This legal decision has not stopped him from seeking legal challenges to the court's decision. In 2011 a Superior Court judge dismissed a suit by Fabrikant against his colleagues that had been filed in 1992. He has filed so many lawsuits while behind bars that Canadian courts have declared him a "vexatious litigant" and his computer access while in prison is limited.

The American Breed

The American Breed were an American rock band from Chicago in the 1960s. The band were originally called Gary &amp; The Knight Lites before adopting the name The American Breed in 1967. The band had a number of charting songs in 1967–68, the best-known of which was "Bend Me, Shape Me". The band broke up in 1970, and members went on to form Rufus after the split.
History.
The American Breed originated as a group formed in 1961 by Gary Loizzo in Cicero, Illinois, United States, called Gary &amp; The Knight Lites. Gary &amp; The Knight Lites was influenced by The Everly Brothers and rhythm &amp; blues songs, and they were joined in their first recording session by Charles "Chuck" Colbert whose father owned the recording studio. Songs they recorded included "I'm Glad She's Mine", and "Will You Go Steady". Other releases included "I Don't Need Your Help" and "I Can't Love You Anymore". They also recorded "One, Two, Boogaloo" as The Light Nites. The original members of the group included Gary Loizzo (vocals and guitar), Charles "Chuck" Colbert, Jr. (bass guitar and vocals), Al Ciner (guitar and vocals), and Jim Michalak (drums). In 1965, local drummer Lee Graziano was asked to substitute for Michalak, initially for just a weekend, while the latter was in Las Vegas; however, after Michalak did not return for the two subsequent weekends, Graziano continued to fill the drummer role and ultimately became Michalak's permanent replacement, completing what would become the classic American Breed line-up. Meanwhile, the group would record until 1966 before becoming The American Breed.
On January 20, 1967 a freak snow storm that dumped twenty inches on Chicago changed the fate of Gary &amp; The Knight Lites when Kenny Myers, former Senior Vice President of Mercury Records, found himself stranded and met with Producer Bill Traut in his studio at Universal Recording. After Traut played Meyers some of the band's tapes, Meyers was impressed enough to sign them to his new record label, Acta (a subsidiary of Dot Records, itself owned by Paramount Pictures, whose record holdings later evolved into the Famous Music Group) and suggested they change their name. "They told us Gary and the Knight Lites sounded a little dated", Loizzo told Chicago Tribune in 1994. "So we put a bunch of names in a hat and pulled out American Breed". The band's first single was "I Don't Think You Know Me", written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin.
The American Breed enjoyed its greatest success in 1967 and 1968, when five of their singles reached the charts. The first to chart was "Step Out of Your Mind", which reached No. 24 in "Billboard" Hot 100 in July 1967. The success allowed the group, originally signed for singles, to make albums and quit their daytime gigs to pursue music full-time. The band's biggest success was "Bend Me, Shape Me", which reached No. 5 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in 1968. The song, written by Scott English and Larry Weiss, had previously been recorded by an all-female band known as the Models and was also a hit on the UK Singles Chart for the British group Amen Corner. It had also been recorded by The Outsiders after they had reached the top ten with "Time Won't Let Me" in 1966. Contributing to the success of the American Breed's version of "Bend Me, Shape Me" was the arrangement of the song by the band's record producer, Bill Traut, who added horns among other changes. The group also appeared on the 16 December 1967 episode of the television show "American Bandstand", along with Pink Floyd. The song sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. The song also peaked at No. 24 in the UK Singles Chart, and No. 9 in the German charts. Other hit songs included "Green Light".
The band also found themselves in high demand in the lucrative radio jingles market, recording commercials for Coca-Cola, the United States Navy, and Bell Telephone, among others. Their television commercial for American Airlines ("Fly the American Way") was also a big success in the top twenty TV markets and their songs were also featured on the soundtrack to the films "No Way to Treat a Lady" (1968) and "The Brain" (1969).
In 1968, the band appeared three times on "American Bandstand" and later that same year, Kevin Murphy joined as keyboardist and the band briefly altered the name to "THE American BREED" before shortening to "The Breed". Their next single, "Keep the Faith", failed to make the charts and singer Paulette McWilliams was added in 1969 in a move towards a more R&amp;B funk sound on their next single "Hunky Funky", which "bubbled under" at No. 107. But the band was for all intents and purposes finished by then, though Loizzo briefly tried to keep the name afloat in 1970 with one last single, "Can't Make It Without You", which went nowhere.
Loizzo went on to open his own recording studio, Pumpkin, where he worked on producing commercials and other groups, eventually receiving a Grammy nomination for his work with Styx. Colbert, Graziano, McWilliams, and Murphy (after a brief stint in the military) regrouped as Smoke and then Äsk Rufus (the name soon abbreviated to Rufus). McWilliams was later replaced by Chaka Khan and the band later scored their first Top 10 hit under the Rufus name with "Tell Me Something Good" in 1974.
The four members of The American Breed (Ciner, Loizzo, Colbert, and Graziano) briefly reunited in 1986 and recorded the album "Once Again", featuring a new version of "Bend Me, Shape Me".
A compilation album, "Bend Me, Shape Me: The Best of the American Breed", was released in 1994. "Bend Me, Shape Me" continues to receive airplay on oldies radio stations.
Since that first regrouping in 1986, the band has continued to make periodic reunion appearances at shows and fairs, mostly in and around their native Chicago.
Their lead singer, Gary Loizzo, died of pancreatic cancer on January 16, 2016, aged 70.

Politics (song)

"Politics" is a song by the American nu metal band Korn and The Matrix for Korn's seventh studio album, "See You on the Other Side". It was released as the album's third single in August 2006 instead of the previous choice, "Love Song", and is the last Korn single to feature David Silveria on drums.
Chart performance.
The song did not reach the same success as "Twisted Transistor" and "Coming Undone", peaking at number eighteen on "Billboard"'s Mainstream Rock Songs chart in January 2007. Promotional singles containing an array of remixes were issued to dance clubs, along with an exclusive iTunes EP coinciding with the United States midterm elections in November 2006. This would give Korn their third consecutive (and overall) charting single on "Billboard"s Dance/Club Play Songs chart, with a peak of number 20.
Music video.
The video was shot live on August 26, 2006, at the Alpine Valley Amphitheatre in East Troy, Wisconsin, during the Family Values Tour. Along with a traditional camera shoot by Chris Kantrowitz, the band put handheld cameras in the hands of ten members of its fanclub and local area fans who were given all access passes to shoot the performance and any behind-the-scenes footage that they chose. It was released exclusively on MP3.com on October 3, 2006.

1020 Arcadia

1020 Arcadia, provisional designation , is a stony Agnia asteroid from the central regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 7 March 1924, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg Observatory in Heidelberg, Germany. The asteroid was named after the Greek region of Arcadia.
Orbit and classification.
"Arcadia" is a member of the Agnia family (), a very large family of stony asteroids with more than 2000 known members. They most likely formed from the breakup of a basalt object, which in turn was spawned from a larger parent body that underwent igneous differentiation. The family's parent body and namesake is the asteroid 847 Agnia.
It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.7–2.9 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,703 days; semi-major axis of 2.79 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg in March 1924, six days after its official discovery observation.
Physical characteristics.
In the SMASS classification, "Arcadia" is a common, stony S-type asteroid. It has been characterized as an S-type by Pan-STARRS photometric survey, as well as by SDSS-MFB (Masi Foglia Bus).
Rotation period.
In November 2011, a fragmentary rotational lightcurve of "Arcadia" was obtained from photometric observations by Gordon Gartrelle at the University of North Dakota. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 17.02 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.05 magnitude (). As of 2018, no secure period has been obtained.
Diameter and albedo.
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, "Arcadia" measures between 10.067 and 13.02 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.150 and 0.2364. The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" assumes an albedo 0.057, i.e. an albedo for a carbonaceous rather than for a stony asteroid, and consequently calculates a much larger diameter of 21.16 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.1. It may be speculated whether this anomaly is a glitch in the data base.
Naming.
This minor planet was named after the Greek region of Arcadia in central Peloponnese. It is also a celebrated mythological region, where the shepherd god Pan lived. The official naming citation was mentioned in "The Names of the Minor Planets" by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

Distribution.
Distributions of West Chadic branches:
History of dispersal.
Roger Blench (2022) suggests that West Chadic languages may have spread via a gradual agricultural dispersal in Central Nigeria, starting from 3,000–4,000 years ago. Blench notes that West Chadic morphology has been heavily influenced by Plateau languages, likely as a result of long-term intermarriage that occurred as West Chadic incomers took local wives who spoke Plateau languages.
Reconstruction.
Although no full reconstruction of West Chadic has been published, reconstructions of numerals for West Chadic and its subgroups have been proposed by Václav Blažek (2018).
Phonology.
The labial–velar consonants /kp/ and /gb/, widespread in Plateau and other Niger-Congo languages but uncommon in Chadic languages, can be found in Ron languages and in certain West Chadic A3 and Bole-Tangale languages. These consonants were borrowed from Plateau languages due to intensive long-term contact. However, other phonological features typical of Plateau and Niger-Congo languages such as ATR and vowel harmony are not found in West Chadic languages.

<doc id="6994700" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6994700" title="Picoplankton">
Picoplankton

Picoplankton is the fraction of plankton composed by cells between 0.2 and 2 μm that can be either prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs and heterotrophs:
They are prevalent amongst microbial plankton communities of both freshwater and marine ecosystems. They have an important role in making up a significant portion of the total biomass of phytoplankton communities.
Classification.
In general, plankton can be categorized on the basis of physiological, taxonomic, or dimensional characteristics. Subsequently, a generic classification of a plankton includes:
However, there is a simpler scheme that categorizes plankton based on a logarithmic size scale: 
This was even further expanded to include picoplankton (0.2–2 μm) and femtoplankton (0.02–0.2 μm), as well as net plankton, ultraplankton. Now that picoplankton have been characterized, they have their own further subdivisions such as prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs and heterotrophs that are spread throughout the world in various types of lakes and trophic states. 
In order to differentiate between autotrophic picoplankton and heterotrophic picoplankton, the autotrophs could have photosynthetic pigments and the ability to show autofluorescence, which would allow for their enumeration under epifluorescence microscopy. This is how minute eukaryotes first became known. 
Overall, picoplankton play an essential role in oligotrophic dimicitc lakes because they are able to produce and then accordingly recycle dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a very efficient manner under circumstance when competition of other phytoplankters is disturbed by factors such as limiting nutrients and predators. Picoplankton are responsible for the most primary productivity in oligotrophic gyres, and are distinguished from nanoplankton and microplankton. Because they are small, they have a greater surface to volume ratio, enabling them to obtain the scarce nutrients in these ecosystems.
Furthermore, some species can also be mixotrophic. The smallest of cells (200 nm) are on the order of nanometers, not picometers. The SI prefix pico- is used quite loosely here, as nanoplankton and microplankton are only 10 and 100 times larger, respectively, although it is somewhat more accurate when considering the volume rather than the length.
Role in ecosystems.
Picoplankton contribute greatly to the biomass and primary production in both marine and freshwater lake ecosystems. In the ocean, the concentration of picoplankton is 105–107 cells per millilitre of ocean water. Algal picoplankton is responsible for up to 90 percent of the total carbon production daily and annually in oligotrophic marine ecosystems. The amount of total carbon production by picoplankton in oligotrophic freshwater systems is also high, making up 70 percent of total annual carbon production. Marine picoplankton make up a higher percentage of biomass and carbon production in zones that are oligotrophic, like the open ocean, versus regions near the shore that are more nutrient rich. Their biomass and carbon production percentage also increases as the depth into the euphotic zone increases. This is due to their use of photopigments and efficiency at using blue-green light at these depths. Picoplankton population densities do not fluctuate throughout the year except in a few cases of smaller lakes where their biomass increases as the temperature of the lake water increases.
Picoplankton also play an important role in the microbial loop of these systems by aiding in providing energy to higher trophic levels. They are grazed by a various number of organisms such as flagellates, ciliates, rotifers and copepods. Flagellates are their main predator due to their ability to swim towards picoplankton in order to consume them.
Oceanic picoplankton.
Picoplankton are important in nutrient cycling in all major oceans, where they exist in their highest abundances. They have many features that allow them to survive in these oligotrophic (low-nutrient) and low-light regions, such as the use several nitrogen sources, including nitrate, ammonium, and urea. Their small size and large surface area allows for efficient nutrient acquisition, incident light absorption, and organism growth. A small size also allows for minimal metabolic maintenance.
Picoplankton, specifically phototrophic picoplankton, play a significant role in the carbon production of open oceanic environments, which largely contributes to the global carbon production. Their carbon production contributes to at least 10% of global aquatic net primary productivity. High primary productivity contributions are made in both oligotrophic and deep zones in oceans. Picoplankton are dominant in biomass in open ocean regions.
Picoplankton also form the base of aquatic microbial food webs and are an energy source in the microbial loop. All trophic levels in a marine food web are affected by picoplankton carbon production and the gain or loss of picoplankton in the environment, especially in oligotrophic conditions. Marine predators of picoplankton include heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates. Protozoa are a dominant predator of picoplankton. Picoplankton are often lost through processes such as grazing, parasitism, and viral lysis.
Measurement.
Marine scientists have slowly begun to understand in the last 10 or 15 years the importance of even the smallest subdivisions of plankton and their role in aquatic food webs and in organic and inorganic nutrient recycling. Therefore, being able to accurately measure the biomass and size distribution of picoplankton communities has now become rather essential. Two of the prevalent methods used to identify and enumerate picoplankton are fluorescence microscopy and visual counting. However, both methods are outdated because of their time-consuming and inaccurate nature. As a result, newer, faster, and more accurate methods have emerged lately, including flow cytometry and image-analyzed fluorescence microscopy. Both techniques are efficient in measuring nano plankton and auto-fluorescing phototrophic picoplankton. However, measuring very minute size ranges of picoplankton has often proven to be difficult to measure, which is why charge-coupled devices (CCD) and video cameras are now being used to measure small picoplankton, although a slow-scan CCD-based camera is more effective at detecting and sizing tiny particles such as bacteria that is fluorochrome-stained.

Richard R. Wright

Richard Robert Wright Sr. (May 16, 1855 – July 2, 1947) was an American military officer, educator and college president, politician, civil rights advocate and banking entrepreneur. Among his many accomplishments, he founded a high school, a college, and a bank. He also founded the National Freedom Day Association in 1941.
Early life and education.
Wright was born into slavery on May 16, 1855, in a log cabin six miles from Dalton, Georgia.
After emancipation in 1865, Wright's mother moved with her son from Dalton to Cuthbert, Georgia. He attended the Storrs School, which developed by the late 1870s as Atlanta University, a historically black college or university. Today it is known as Clark Atlanta University, following a merger. The school had a reputation among freedmen as a place for their children to be educated. 
While visiting the school, retired Union General Oliver Otis Howard asked students what message he should take to the North. The young Wright reportedly told him, "Sir, tell them we are rising." That exchange inspired a once-famous poem by John Greenleaf Whittier, "Howard at Atlanta".
The Storrs School was one of many academic schools for freedmen's children founded by the American Missionary Association (AMA) in the South. Wright was valedictorian at the first commencement ceremony in 1876.
Career.
Republican politics.
Wright joined the Republican Party and became active in its politics. Blacks worked to resist white Democratic efforts to disrupt their organizing and suppress their votes. 
There were also tensions within the party. In 1890, Emanuel K. Love and Wright were in a dispute with William White, Judson Lyons, Henry A. Rucker, and especially John H. Deveaux, who was in control of Georgia's Republic Party machinery. At the time, the party was dominated by African Americans. The dispute centered around leadership of the party district nomination conventions. Lyons, Rucker, and Deveaux were all supported by patronage of Booker T. Washington of the Tuskegee Institute. They were identified with light-skinned elites of the state, some of whose families had been free people of color, free for generations before the Civil War. Love, Wright (and Charles T. Walker) represented a "black" or "darker-skinned" faction. Skin color and assumptions about economic class were not as important as political allegiance and ideology.
In 1896, Alfred Eliab Buck was the leader of the Georgia Republican Party. Buck was the president of the Republican State Convention in late April and presided over the election of delegates to the 1896 Republican National Convention. When dispute arose, Buck attempted to preempt by passing a "harmony" slate of delegates outside of standard procedure. However, the slate did not include Wright, who had widespread support among party members.
When the convention erupted in protest, a representative of Buck's tried to adjourn the meeting, and the Buck faction left the hall. The Wright faction remained. Wright's friend, Emanuel K. Love, took the chair. A new slate of delegates was elected, including Love and Buck (but not Wright). Wright never did win a seat as a delegate, but he attended the national party convention as an alternate.
Military career.
In August 1898, President William McKinley appointed Wright as a major and paymaster of United States Volunteers in the United States Army. He was the first African American to serve as a U.S. Army paymaster. During the Spanish–American War, he was the highest-ranking African-American officer. He was honorably discharged in December of the same year.
Georgia State Industrial College for Colored Youth.
The Second Morrill Land Grant Act of August 30, 1890 provided more land-grant funding to states, but also established federal oversight. It required that Southern and border states, which had segregated public schools, develop land grant colleges for black students in order to receive any funds under this program. Georgia was among the several states that had not done so. On November 26, 1890 the Georgia General Assembly passed legislation creating the Georgia State Industrial College for Colored Youth.
In 1891, Wright was appointed as the first president of the Georgia State Industrial College for Colored Youth (now Savannah State University), the first public historically black college (HBCU) in the state. By October 1891, it was having classes in Savannah, Georgia, which became its permanent home. It started with five faculty and eight students, but rapidly attracted more. It has since developed as Savannah State University, the oldest public HBCU in the state.
During the 1890s, Wright traveled to other colleges, including Tuskegee Institute, Hampton Institute, Girard College of Philadelphia, and the Hirsch School in New York, to document current trends in higher education. Based on his studies, he developed a curriculum at Georgia State College to include elements of the seven classical liberal arts, the "Talented Tenth" philosophy of W. E. B. Du Bois; Booker T. Washington’s vocational emphasis and self-reliance concepts, and the educational model of New England colleges. (He had graduated from Atlanta University, and was taught by graduates of Dartmouth College and Yale University).
Wright was viewed as one of the leading figures of black higher education in America, and he conferred regularly with major educational leaders. Visitors and lecturers to campus during his tenure as president included Mary McLeod Bethune, George Washington Carver, Walter Barnard Hill, Lucy Craft Laney, Mary Church Terrell, Booker T. Washington and Monroe Nathan Work. U.S. presidents William McKinley and William Howard Taft also visited the campus and spoke to students in Peter W. Meldrim Hall.
By the end of Wright's tenure as president, the college's enrollment had increased from the original eight students to more than 400. Additionally, he expanded the curriculum to include a normal division (for teacher training) and courses in agriculture and mechanical arts. He also provided four-year high-school subjects to prepare students who came from areas without such facilities, as was the case for many blacks from rural Georgia.
Wright participated in the March 5, 1897 meeting to celebrate the memory of Frederick Douglass, who was an abolitionist and public intellectual. The group founded the American Negro Academy, led by Alexander Crummell. From the founding of the organization until 1902, Wright remained active among the scholars, editors, and activists of this first major African-American learned society. Their work refuted racist scholarship, promoted black claims to individual, social, and political equality, and published the history and sociology of African-American life. 
Banker.
After moving to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1921, Wright decided to open a bank. At the age of 67, he enrolled in the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania to prepare for this venture. He entered the business world in 1921, creating and leading Philadelphia's Citizens and Southern Bank and Trust Company at 1849 South Street. At the time, it was the only African-American-owned bank in the North and the first African-American trust company. He also founded the Negro Bankers Association, the first African-American banking association.
Under his leadership, the bank withstood the Great Depression. When it was sold in 1957, more than a decade after Wright's death, it had assets of $5.5 million.
Personal life.
Wright married Lydia Elizabeth (née Howard). Together the couple had nine children, including Richard R. Wright Jr. He followed his father into an academic career.
Legacy.
Civil rights leader.
Richard Wright wrote a landmark letter to President Harry Truman describing the horrible mistreatment of Isaac Woodard, a black veteran who had been severely beaten and had his eyes gouged out by white policemen. As a result of this letter and advocacy by the NAACP about the case, President Truman asked his Attorney General, Tom Clark, to investigate. Clark brought a federal case against the police and sheriff who abused Woodard, but the all-white jury acquitted them. Georgia had passed an amendment in 1908 that essentially disenfranchised black voters; this absence from the voter rolls also resulted in their exclusion from juries. 
Wright and others, including white liberals, were outraged, and they advocated for a federal civil-rights commission. Agreeing with this, Truman formed a committee on civil rights. It made far-reaching and prescient recommendations, including that there should be a permanent civil rights division in the Justice Department and that the entire executive branch of the federal government should be desegregated. Some agencies had established segregation in their facilities in the early 20th century under President Woodrow Wilson, who was influenced by his own background in the South and by Southern members of his cabinet. The military was still segregated, although blacks and other minorities had been arguing since World War I to end this, especially during World War II. 
As a result, Truman ordered the desegregation of all branches of the military. The U.S. military has remained desegregated ever since.
Family legacy.
In June 1898, Wright's son Richard R. Wright Jr. received the first baccalaureate degree awarded by Georgia State Industrial College. Wright Jr. was the first African American to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, having studied in the new field of sociology. He became a professor and later president of Wilberforce University in Ohio. He also was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent black denomination in the United States. Wright Jr. became a bishop in the AME Church.
One of Richard Jr's daughters, Dr. Ruth Wright Hayre, also earned a Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania. They were the first African-American father and daughter to do so. Dr. Ruth Wright Hayre became the first full-time African-American teacher in the Philadelphia public-school system. She rose to become an administrator and high-school principal. After being elected to the Philadelphia Board of Education, she served as its first female president. 
At the age of 80, she established the "Tell Them We Are Rising" program, promising to pay college tuition for 116 sixth-graders in two poor North Philadelphia schools if they completed high school. Her story was chronicled in her book "Tell Them We Are Rising: A Memoir of Faith in Education", published in 1997, the year before she died.
National Freedom Day.
In 1941, Wright invited national and local leaders to meet in Philadelphia to formulate plans to set aside February 1 each year to memorialize the anniversary of the 1865 signing by President Abraham Lincoln of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which freed all U.S. slaves. They formed the National Freedom Day Association. 
One year after Wright's death in 1947, both houses of the U.S. Congress passed a bill to make February 1 National Freedom Day. The holiday proclamation was signed into law on June 30, 1948, by President Harry Truman. It was the forerunner to Black History Day and later Black History Month, officially recognized in 1976, though begun by Carter G. Woodson in 1926.

1035 Amata

1035 Amata is a carbonaceous asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 57 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany on 29 September 1924 and assigned the provisional designation . It was probably named after Amata from Roman mythology.
Classification and orbit.
The C-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.6–3.8 AU once every 5 years and 7 months (2,049 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 18° with respect to the ecliptic. The first used observation was taken at the discovering observatory in 1913, extending the body's observation arc by 11 years prior to its discovery.
Naming.
"Amata"s name is of . It is thought to have been named after Amata, wife of King Latinus in Roman mythology and a character in Virgil's "Aeneid". She is also the mother of Lavinia, the wife of Aeneas, after whom 1172 Äneas, one of the largest Jupiter trojans, is named.
Unknown meaning.
Among the many thousands of named minor planets, "Amata" is one of 120 asteroids, for which no official naming citation has been published. All of these low-numbered asteroids have numbers between and and were discovered between 1876 and the 1930s, predominantly by astronomers Auguste Charlois, Johann Palisa, Max Wolf and Karl Reinmuth.
Physical characteristics.
In October 2002, a rotational light-curve of "Amata" was obtained from photometric observations by American amateur astronomer Robert Stevens at the Santana Observatory () in California. It gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.44 in magnitude (). In the same month, another observation was made at the Oakley Observatory in the U.S. state of Indiana and gave a very similar period of hours and a variation in brightness of 0.32 in magnitude ().
According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, "Amata" measures between 50.7 and 62.2 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has a low albedo between 0.038 and 0.052. The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" derived a diameter of 50.7 kilometers and an albedo of 0.057.

Chris White (musician)

Christopher Taylor White (born 7 March 1943) is an English musician. He came to prominence in the mid-1960s as the bass guitarist and occasional lead vocalist of the rock band The Zombies. White is one of the main composers of the Zombies' music, and made major lyrical contributions to the band's songs. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019 as a member of the Zombies.
Early years.
White was born on 7 March 1943, in Barnet, Hertfordshire, to Harold White, a bus inspector for London Transport, and his wife Nan. The family soon relocated to Markyate, Hertfordshire, where his parents Harold and Nan White owned the village general store, selling groceries, hardware, paint, and furniture. As a pastime, Harold White played double bass in dance bands performing the music of Glenn Miller and other swing bands; he gave his son his earliest musical training, playing guitar alongside White on the ukulele. There was also a piano in the house. White attended St Albans County Grammar School, Hertfordshire, where he met Colin Blunstone, later meeting Rod Argent, Paul Atkinson, and Hugh Grundy who were at St. Albans School, the musicians who became the Zombies. Atkinson nicknamed White "the daddy of the group" since was at least two years older than the rest of the Zombies and the only member to have memories of the Second World War.
The Zombies.
White replaced the Zombies' initial bass guitarist, Paul Arnold, and became one of the band's two main songwriters, alongside Rod Argent. He wrote two tracks on their US debut album, "The Zombies", released in January 1965. On the UK debut release, "Begin Here", he had three tracks. For the Zombies' performances in the 1965 film "Bunny Lake Is Missing" White wrote "Nothing's Changed" and "Remember You". 
An album, Begin Here (renamed to The Zombies when released in the US) would follow. They would appear on American television for the first time on January 12 1965, when they appeared on the first episode of Hullabaloo.
The Zombies would have another chart-topper in 1964 with Tell Her No. The group continued to record successfully through the 1960s, but disbanded in December 1967, reportedly over management disagreements. A second album was released in 1968 titled Odessey and Oracle, which featured the song Time of the Season. Time of the Season is one of the Zombies most successful singles, along with She’s Not There.
One of the main songwriters of the band, he also wrote seven of the twelve songs on the band's second and final album and generally acknowledged masterpiece, "Odessey and Oracle". White also contributed lead vocals to "Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914)" and a verse of "Brief Candles". Some releases of "She's Not There" attribute Chris as the composer instead of Rod Argent.
His song "I Love You", originally recorded by the Zombies in 1965, was a hit for the band People! in 1968.
In March 2008, White began a series of live performances with the other three surviving members of the Zombies, including the first complete performances of the album "Odessey and Oracle", in celebration of the 40th anniversary of its release.
While White is not a member of The Zombies’ current lineup, he has rejoined the group on several tours featuring the surviving original lineup between 2008 and 2019 to play Odessey and Oracle in its entirety.
Argent.
Following the demise of the Zombies, White contributed songwriting and production work to Colin Blunstone's solo career and Rod Argent's new band, Argent. With Argent he co-wrote their 1972 hit "Hold Your Head Up". 
The Chris White Experience.
Since 2019, Chris has been releasing previously unheard material under the series name "The Chris White Experience" featuring performances from a host of well-known artists. As of July 2021, he has released five volumes of songs, and a previously unreleased album by the band Sparrow.
Other work.
In 2007, as part of the band White Circle, he co-wrote, co-produced and performed on the album "The Key" with his son Matthew White and wife Vivienne Boucherat.
Also in 2007/2008, White co-produced and played on the album "Featherhead" for his youngest son, the London-based singer-songwriter JJ White.
Chris and his wife Vivienne Boucherat provide backing vocals on the 2016 album "My Religion" by John Verity.
Personal life.
White currently resides in London. He is married to Viv Boucherat. White is father to three sons; Matthew, Jamie ("JJ") and Sacha.

Lanigan's Ball

"Lanigan's Ball" (sometimes "Lannigan's Ball") is a popular Irish folk song which has been played throughout the world since at least the 1860s and possibly much longer. Typically performed in a minor key, it generally is played in an upbeat style reminiscent of the party atmosphere in which the story that the lyrics portray unfolds.
In Alfred Perceval Graves' book, "Songs of Irish Wit and Humour", published in 1884, "Lanigan's Ball" is attributed to . In "Folk Songs of the Catskills", edited by Norman Cazden, Herbert Haufrecht and Norman Studer, there is a reference to John Diprose's songster of 1865 attributing "Lanigan's Ball" to D. K. Gavan with music by John Candy. It also mentions that the tune was previously known as "Hurry the Jug". In 1863 William Pond &amp; Company published the song in an arrangement by Charles William Glover, attributing the words to Tony Pastor and the music to Neil Bryant of Bryant's Minstrels.
Origin and subject.
"Lanigan's Ball", a tune about a party thrown by the titular Jeremy Lanigan in Athy, County Kildare, is speculated to be inspired by a real party. It falls into the tradition of what is essentially a musical inside joke, and was likely written by a party goer in thanks to the host. The song describes a raucous party thrown by Lanigan after inheriting land from his father, and for the friends and family who helped him while he was living in self-afflicted poverty.
The party moves from a lively party;
Into a chaotic brawl, before the party finally ends.
Recordings and cover versions.
This song has been covered by many artists. The Bards had a hit with it in Ireland in 1980. Christy Moore recorded it on his LP "The Time Has Come" in 1983, re-released on CD in 2007.
A version of this song was recorded by the American celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys on their sixth studio album, "The Meanest of Times". The title was changed to "(F)lannigan's Ball", and the lyrics have been significantly altered, although the subject matter of the song remains the same. Jump, Little Children performs another popular version of this song with most of the lyrics retained. The Celtic fusion band Enter the Haggis also recorded this song on their album "Aerials" with its traditional lyrics. New York rock band the Jim C Experience did a version of the song entitled "Glennigan's Ball". The German band Fiddler's Green recorded it in 1995 for the Album "King Shepherd". LeperKhanz recorded a version of the song on the album 2005 "Tiocfaidh Ár Lá". David Kincaid, on his album "The Irish American's Song", the second volume of his Irish-American Civil War songs, does a version called "The President's Ball". Without Question, from Rochester, NY, covered the song on their EP "Without Question". Johnny Logan covered the song on his 2013 album, "The Irish Connection 2"
A parody version by Frank Kelly called "Charlie Stepped In" lampooned the Arms Trial and the political instability of 1970s and early 1980s Ireland.

W. R. Myers High School shooting

The W. R. Myers High School shooting occurred on April 28, 1999, at W. R. Myers High School in Taber, Alberta, Canada. The gunman, 14-year-old school dropout Todd Cameron Smith, entered the school and began firing at students in a hallway, then went to the central hub of the school in front of the band room, killed one student and wounded another. It was the first fatal high-school shooting in Canada since the St. Pius X High School shooting, 24 years earlier.
Shooting.
The incident began when Smith entered the school campus armed with a .22-caliber Ruger 10/22 semi-automatic rifle and 375 rounds of ammunition (350 rounds of live ammunition in his coat pocket and 25 rounds loaded into the rifle). As lunch concluded, he fired at three students in a hallway adjacent to the cafeteria. He fatally shot 17-year-old Jason Lang at point-blank range, and then shot at one other student. Gym coach Cheyno Finnie managed to wrestle Smith to the ground. He was arrested without further incident by a Taber constable, who also served as the school's resource officer. Smith was charged with one count of first-degree murder, and two counts of attempted murder.
Aftermath.
Legal proceedings.
Smith's identity and background were originally protected under Canada's Young Offenders Act at the time of his arrest. He had dropped out of W.R. Myers High School earlier in the school year. According to court documents, he had suffered severe bullying throughout his school years, including having been doused with lighter fluid and threatened to be set alight when he was in the first grade. He was remembered as being intelligent but socially awkward, and had become "reclusive and extremely fearful" by early adolescence. His mother said he had been showing signs of depression throughout his childhood. Smith's family stated that he "snapped" after watching coverage of the Columbine High School massacre, which had occurred eight days prior.
Crown prosecutors attempted to have then 15-year-old Smith tried as an adult with the potential for a life sentence with the possibility of parole in five years. The Crown argued that an adult prison would offer greater educational programs than a youth facility could provide. The court denied the motion and he was tried as a juvenile.
Following his arrest and before the trial, a medical examination discovered Smith had a heart ailment that required open heart surgery. During the surgery, he suffered a stroke and fell into a coma. After awakening from the coma, he had speaking and eating difficulties and suffered from diminished mental capacity. His case was suspended until he recovered, as both the Crown and defense agreed he could not stand trial. Following a "remarkable recovery", he was declared suitable to stand trial, and was scheduled to appear in court in September 2000. At his trial, Smith pleaded guilty to all three charges, and was sentenced to three years in prison, and was ordered to live seven years on probation upon release.
Smith's release, second arrest.
In March 2005, Todd Cameron Smith was released into a halfway house in Toronto, despite the agreement of the judge that the then 20-year-old remained a threat to society. In August of that year, he walked out of the halfway house, leaving behind a note reading, "I can't be caged any more. If they find me, they'll have to kill me. I will never be caged again. Bye. Sorry." His escape prompted Toronto police to obtain a court injunction allowing them to publicize his identity until such time as he was caught.
However, Smith turned himself in to authorities the following day and was arrested without incident. The waiver allowing the publication of his identity in Canada lapsed upon his recapture, though not before his name was published and released by several news outlets across the country. Following his recapture, Canadian media were required to no longer use Smith's name or photograph, as they had done the previous day.

International call

An international telephone call is a call between the origination and destination located in different countries. In the public switched telephone network (PSTN), these telephone calls are processed by international gateway exchanges (switches). Charges for these calls were high historically but declined greatly during the 20th century due to advances in technology liberalization. Originally they were placed via long-distance operators. The calls are transmitted by cable, radio links, fiber, and communications satellites, but the advent of the Internet has enabled direct connections from endpoint to endpoint with Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies. In the 1960s, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) established a world-wide telephone numbering plan to facilitate fully automatic international service, by the use of telephone country codes. International direct dialing in the PSTN was introduced in the 1970s so that calls could be initiated without an operator.
International calls can be paid via telephone card (aka phone card, calling card). These popular telecommunications products allow users to initiate an international call from almost anywhere in the world. These cards typically offer rates lower than most traditional long-distance products and services, and can be used via landline, cellular phone, PBX, and some VoIP services, as well as from some airports and hotels.
In the United Kingdom, there are various ways to make an international call. For users with access to a landline:
For mobile phone users, the choices used to be very limited but it is no longer the case as mobile phone network operators roll out new pricing models and innovation in call routing developed. There are now numerous ways for a mobile phone user to call internationally:
A Local Dialling Disparity exists where the originating number and the foreign number are on the same network, usually a mobile telephone provider with operations in multiple countries. A less expensive call path is available by routing within the local Mobile Switching Center without going out to the global GMSC to its HLR. Both users are on the same network, so the international call remains within that company's network.
There are instances of telephone country codes covering points in more than one country; the North American Numbering Plan is one example, as is nominally-sovereign Vatican City's use of Italian numbering. The term overseas call is used by the Bell System to distinguish international calls to another country code from NANP-internal calls.

Godaan

Godaan (, ) is a Hindi novel by Munshi Premchand. It was first published in 1936 and is considered one of the greatest novels of modern Indian literature. Themed around the socio-economic deprivation as well as the exploitation of the village poor, the novel was the last complete novel of Premchand. It follows the story of an old poor farmer, stuck in a debt trap, who wants to purchase a cow, but is unable to do so for lack of money. It was translated into English in 1957 by Jai Ratan and Purushottama Lal as The Gift of a Cow. A 1968 translation by Gordon C. Roadarmel is now considered "a classic in itself".
"Godaan" was made into a Hindi film in 1963, starring Raaj Kumar, Kamini Kaushal, Mehmood and Shashikala. In 2004, "Godaan" was part of the 27-episode TV series, "Tehreer... Munshi Premchand Ki", [The Writings of Munshi Premchand] based on the writing of Premchand, starring Pankaj Kapur and Surekha Sikri, directed by Gulzar and produced by Doordarshan.
Plot.
The story revolves around various characters representing different sections of the Indian community. Hori Mahato's family represents the rural and peasant society. His family includes his wife Dhania, daughters Rupa and Sona, son Gobar, and daughter-in-law Jhunia. The story begins with Hori's desire to own a cow, like many other poor peasants. He purchases a cow from Bhola, a cowherd, on a debt of 80 rupees.
Envious of Hori, his younger brother, Heera, poisons the cow and flees out of fear of police action. When the police arrive to inquire about the cow's death, Hori takes a loan and bribes the police to clear his younger brother's name. Jhunia, Bhola's widowed daughter, elopes with Gobar after becoming pregnant by him. Fearing the reaction of the villagers, Gobar too runs away to the town. Hori and Dhania are reluctant to drive away Jhunia as she is carrying their son's child; they decide to accept her as their daughter-in-law and offer her shelter. The village panchayat fines Hori for sheltering Jhunia, after a personal attack by the Pandit. Hori again is compelled to take a loan and pay the penalty.
Hori accumulates a huge debt from local money lenders and is eventually forced to marry off his daughter Rupa for a mere 200 rupees to save his ancestral land from auction due to unpaid land tax. However, his determination to repay those 200 rupees and get a cow to provide milk for his grandson leads to his death from overwork
In Godaan, Hori epitomizes the downtrodden peasant - a victim of his circumstances, possessing both faults and virtues. Throughout the hardships he endures, Hori stays true to his values and duties. The novel concludes with Hori's death and the bittersweet legacy he leaves behind, defined by fulfilled and unfulfilled dreams, thus providing a moving finale.
Characters.
The urban society is represented by Ms. Malati (doctor), Mr. Mehta (lecturer and philosopher), Mr. Khanna (bank manager and industrialist), Rai Sahib(zamindar), Mr Tankha (broker), Mr. Mirza (social worker) and Pandit Onkarnath (owner and editor of the newspaper Bijli)
Themes.
The novel has several themes:
The narrative represents the average Indian farmer's existence under colonial rule, with the protagonist facing cultural and feudal exploitation. It shows how the life of these characters takes shape.
Connection with Hinduism.
The act of donating a cow in charity, or "godaan" or "gau daan", is considered to be an important Hindu ritual, as it helps in absolving one of sin, and incurring divine blessings. It is also essential. The word "dharma" has been used 34 times in the novel in different context and by different characters. The word connotes as religion, moral principles and values, conscience and duty. It has a different meaning to each character.
Legacy.
"Godaan" is regarded as an enduring Hindi-language cult-classic work by "Premchand". Like his other novels, "Godaan" too depicts the social struggles of the lower class.
"Godaan" was made into a Hindi film in 1963, starring Raaj Kumar, Kamini Kaushal, Mehmood and Shashikala. In 2004, "Godaan" was part of the 27-episode TV series, "Tehreer... Munshi Premchand Ki", based on the writing of Premchand, starring Pankaj Kapur and Surekha Sikri, directed by Gulzar and produced by Doordarshan.
Godaan is an indispensable part of Indian literature. It is regarded as one of the finest work ever written in Indian language.
This novel was translated into 'The gift of Cow' by Jai Ratan and Purushottama Lal.

Richard P. McCormick

Richard Patrick McCormick (December 24, 1916 – January 16, 2006) was an American historian, former university professor of history, administrator, professor emeritus at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and president of the New Jersey Historical Society. McCormick was internationally recognized for his expertise in New Jersey and early American political history.
Early life and education.
Born in Queens, New York City, on December 24, 1916, McCormick moved with his family to Tenafly, New Jersey. He graduated from Tenafly High School in 1933, and was encouraged to apply for college by a typing teacher in his senior year. He had not planned on attending college and had been in enrolled in a "general curriculum" that lacked the required courses he needed to apply for college. During a post-graduate year at Tenafly High School, he completed the four years of math courses he needed to be eligible for college enrollment.
McCormick received a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) in history from Rutgers College at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1938 and proceeded to earn a Master of Arts (A.M.) from Rutgers' Graduate School in 1940. During his undergraduate years, McCormick was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He earned his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in 1948 from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where his dissertation was titled, "Experiment in Independence: New Jersey in the Critical Period, 1781-1789", and was edited for his first monograph.
Career.
In 1945, McCormick began teaching at the department of history at Rutgers University. From 1961 to 1962, he was a fellow of Jesus College, University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. In August 1945, McCormick married Katheryne Levis in Baltimore, who he met at the University of Delaware in Newark, Delaware, while teaching in the university's Army Specialized Training Reserve Program in 1944.
McCormick was chair of the Rutgers College history department from 1966 to 1969 and dean of Rutgers College from 1974 to 1977. In 1971, he chaired a committee on coeducation at Rutgers College (which had previously admitted men only) and in 1969 he chaired a special faculty committee to address issues raised by African-American students at Rutgers.
McCormick retired from teaching in 1982.
McCormick was instrumental in the establishment of several influential historical organizations, including the New Jersey Historical Commission, the New Jersey State Historical Records Advisory Board and the New Jersey Tercentenary Commission, and served as research adviser to Colonial Williamsburg, and as a member of the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission.
His books "The Second American Party System: Party Formations in the Jacksonian Era" (1966) and "Rutgers: A Bicentennial History" (1966) received the biennial book prize from American Association for State and Local History in 1965 and 1968, respectively. In 2002, McCormick was recognized with the Award for Scholarly Distinction from the American Historical Association.
A longtime resident of Piscataway, New Jersey, McCormick moved with his wife to Bridgewater Township, New Jersey, where he lived in his final years. 
Death.
McCormick died on January 16, 2006, in Bridgewater Township, New Jersey, at the age of 89 following an extended illness. He was the father of two children, Dorothy (b. 1950), and Richard Levis McCormick (b. 1947), who was the 19th president of Rutgers University. After Richard L. McCormick became a history professor at Rutgers in the mid-1970s, the two McCormicks taught at least one history course together on American political history.

Jacob van Eyck

 Jacob van Eyck ( , ; 26 March 1657) was a Dutch nobleman, composer and blind musician. He was one of the best-known musicians of the Dutch Golden Age, working as a carillon player and technician, a recorder virtuoso, and a composer. He was an expert in bell casting and tuning, and taught Pieter and François Hemony how to tune a carillon. Van Eyck is credited with developing the modern carillon together with the brothers in 1644, when they cast the first tuned carillon in Zutphen. He is also known for his collection of 143 compositions for recorder, , the largest work for a solo wind instrument in European history.
Biography.
Early life.
Jacob van Eyck was born in 1589 or 1590 into a noble family probably in The Hague and raised in the nearby town Bergen op Zoom. Born blind, he lived with his mother and father well into adulthood. Van Eyck moved to the town of Heusden and became involved as a player and technician of the town's carillon by 1618. He met with several craftsmen and the city organist to discuss changes and improvements to the carillon, which he carried out in 1620 and 1621.
Carillon career.
Van Eyck quickly established himself as a renowned carillon player and technician. In 1623 and 1624, he was employed by the city of Utrecht to repair and renovate the Dom Tower's clock and carillon. A year later, after negotiations with the city, he left home to become the city carillonneur. Over the years, he undertook projects to expand and improve the bell towers at the city hall, the Nicolaïkerk, and the Jacobikerk. His title was changed to "Director of the Bell-Works" in 1628, and he was entrusted with the technical supervision of all the bells of the city. He began instructing students to learn to play the carillon. In 1631, he had a small keyboard composed of 30 small bells constructed for instruction. A year later, he was appointed the carillonneur of . Later in 1645, he accepted the same position at the Jacobikerk and the city hall.
Campanology career.
Van Eyck belonged to a circle of academics who met and corresponded regularly to exchange ideas. One of these was Marin Mersenne, who was the first to codify the harmonics of a vibrating spring. Van Eyck applied Mersenne's research to the acoustics of tuned bells. He devised methods for isolating the partials of a bell by whistling at the partials' resonant frequencies. Van Eyck showcased his discovery to mathematician René Descartes, who on 23 August 1638, wrote to Mersenne: "In Utrecht lives a blind man with a great musical reputation, who regularly plays bells (...). I have seen how he elicits 5 or 6 different sounds on each of the largest bells, without touching them, but only by coming close to their sound rim with his mouth..." In 1633, Van Eyck told Isaac Beeckman that the ideal series of a bell's partials consisted of three notes each an octave apart, supplemented by a minor third and perfect fifth in the second octave, and he convinced Beeckman to write about it in his journal on 24 September. The minor overtone series causes the characteristic melancholy sound of a well-tuned carillon.
Not only could they be isolated, but Van Eyck asserted that they could be tuned harmoniously with each other by altering the shape of the bell itself. He claimed that it is not possible for a bell to be properly tuned upon casting, but instead that adjustments needed to be made to tune it. His assertion was put to the test in 1644. The city of Zutphen commissioned the famous bellfounding duo Pieter and François Hemony to cast a new carillon for its Wijnhuis tower. The city appointed Van Eyck as its consultant. He convinced the Hemony brothers to tune their carillon bells according to his research before finishing the job, rather than waiting for a negative review from the city. To achieve this, François cast the carillon bells slightly too thick so that they could be shaved down while tuning. Where other bellfounders haphazardly shaved the inside of a bell in an attempt to fix its tune, François placed them on a lathe rotated by five or six men to guarantee symmetry. He then shaved down the insides with a chisel to tune the five principal tones. Hemony carillons outfitted with "pure" tuned bells quickly became the standard and were coveted across Europe for decades. Van Eyck's acquaintance with the intellectuals of the time along with his longstanding relationship with bellfounders helps explain how he was able to influence the Hemony brothers.
Recorder career.
In addition to his work with the carillon, Van Eyck was a particularly skillful recorder player. In 1644 in Amsterdam, Paulus Matthysz published Van Eyck's , a collection of variations on popular folk songs at the time for recorder. It was later renamed to . A subsequent volume () was published in 1646 and a revised and greatly enlarged version of first volume was published in 1649. Probably in response to the success of the works, Sint Janskerk increased the salary paid to Van Eyck provided that he entertain passers-by with songs on his recorder. A second version was published in 1657 and a third and final version of was published .
Later life and death.
The final years of Van Eyck's life were spent in declining health. He died on 26 March 1657 in Utrecht. His assistant and caretaker Johan Dicx was the principal legatee of his will and succeeded him in most of his carillonneur positions. He was buried the next day, and for three hours, the bells of Sint Janskerk, the Jacobikerk, and the Dom Tower were tolled in his memory. Lambertus Sanderus composed a four-line verse that is inscribed on Van Eyck's gravestone. In 2006, the mayor of Utrecht unveiled an inlaid memorial tablet in the Dom Square, at an angle to Dom Tower. The Utrecht Bellringers Guild awards the Jacob van Eyck Prize every three years to fund the preservation of Dutch cultural and historical heritage and campanological research. In 2023, the mayor of Utrecht renamed the passageway underneath the Dom Tower as the Jacob van Eyck Passage.
Works.
Van Eyck's sole published work, , is an extensive collection 143 melodies, each with a number of diminutions or variations for solo soprano recorder. The themes include folk songs, dance tunes, church music, psalms, and songs of the day, as well as a few compositions by Van Eyck. Some of the best known include a variation on John Dowland's "Flow, my tears" and a favorite Christmas carol at the time, "Unto Us Is Born a Son". Some of the variations are considered challenging even for an experienced recorder player. remains the largest work for a solo wind instrument in European history; it is also the only work of this magnitude to have been dictated rather than written down by the composer.

Popof Island

Popof Island (Siitikdax̂ in Aleut) is an island in the Shumagin Islands south of mainland Alaska. The largest community in the area, Sand Point, is located on the northwest coast. Popof Island is long, wide and the peak elevation is . It is located at . It has a land area of 93.651 km2 (36.159 sq mi) and a total population of 578 persons at the 2020 census.
Pirate Cove on the island was developed as a major codfish fishing station.
A herd of introduced bison is on the uninhabited side of the island and currently numbers about 120.
Demographics.
Popof Island first appeared as a separate political entity on the 1890 U.S. Census with a population of 146. Of these, 135 were White, 7 were Creole (Mixed Russian &amp; Native), 3 were Asian and 1 was Native. This included 3 settlements on the island: Pirate Cove (a codfishing Station), which had previously appeared on the 1880 census separately with 7 residents (all White), located on the northeast side of the island; Red Cove (a fishing station) on the south side of the island; and Sand Point Station on the northwestern side of the island. Census enumerators also counted all the ships that were docked at Pirate Cove (including schooners "Trapper" and "Unga") and those at Sand Point (including schooners "Alexandria", "City of San Diego", "James Hamilton", "Kate and Annie", "San Diego", "C.N. Smart" &amp; "C.H. White").
Beginning in 1900, Popof Island villages reported separately. Red Cove was abandoned. Pirate Cove appeared once more on the 1920 census (population 98) before it was abandoned. Sand Point became the dominant village on the island, growing from 16 residents in 1900 to 976 by 2010, but was reduced to 578 at the 2020 Census. It incorporated as a city in 1966 and became important enough to be made the equivalent of county seat (borough seat) for the Aleutians East in 1987. As of 2000, all residents of Popof Island reside within the city limits of Sand Point.

Key Words Reading Scheme

The Key Words Reading Scheme is a series of 36 English language early readers children's books, published by the British publishing company, Ladybird Books. The series is also often referred to as Peter and Jane, the names of the main characters.
History.
The first book in the series, Ladybird series 641, was published in 1964, and the series was completed by the first publication of the 36th book in 1967. Over 80 million books in the series have been sold worldwide, and the books remained in print until 2012.
The books were designed as materials for teaching a small child to learn to read, using a system of key phrases and words devised by teacher William Murray. Murray was an educational adviser at a borstal and later headmaster of a "school for the educationally subnormal" in Cheltenham. From research undertaken in the 1950s by Murray with Professor Joe McNally, an educational psychologist at the University of Manchester, Murray realised that only 12 words account for a quarter of the vocabulary used in normal speaking, reading and writing in the English language, 100 words for half, and 300 words for three-quarters.
Starting with book 1a, a budding reader of primary school age, from 3 to 5 years old, is introduced to brother and sister Peter and Jane, their dog Pat, their Mummy and Daddy, and their home, toys, playground, the beach, shops, buses and trains, and so on. The first book uses the 12 key words which are used repeatedly ("Here is Peter", "Peter is here", "Here is Jane", "Jane is here", "I like Peter", "I like Jane"). Additional words are introduced gradually, page by page, to expand the reader's reading vocabulary, with the new words on each page set out in a footnote. The reader can consolidate their learning with books 1b, or practise writing in book 1c, all with the same vocabulary; or progress to book 2a (and 2b and 2c), and so on, with 12 sets of three books in all.
Two more characters, Simon and John, were introduced further into the series, as the books developed in length and detail to become targeted at growing children who had developed further reading skills. These two characters are cousins of Peter and Jane.
Illustrations.
All of the books are small, thin hardback volumes with 56 pages, measuring . Each book has text on a left page and an illustration on the facing right page, drawn by artists Harry Wingfield, Martin Aitchison, Frank Hampson, Robert Ayton and John Berry. The illustrations vary in style from book to book, depending on artist, but Peter and Jane are recognisable throughout. The clear sans serif typeface used in the books starts at a large size and gradually becomes smaller as the reader progresses through the series. The sentence structure also becomes gradually more complex.
The books were first published in 1964, with a firmly 1950s feel to the illustrations provided by the furniture and clothing depicted, and the social context reflecting the life of a white, middle-class family. The books were revised and updated in 1970, and again in the late 1970s, to reflect changes in fashions and in social attitudes. For example, golliwogs were airbrushed out; Daddy takes a more active domestic role; and Jane moved out of skirts and dresses into jeans, and abandoned her dolly for rollerskates. However, Peter still goes out to help Daddy, or actively plays with a ball, while Jane stays indoors to help Mummy, passively watches Peter, or plays with her doll.
Updates.
Few changes have been made to the books since the 1970s, and they may be considered a source of social history. The books make use of the whole word or "look and say" technique which is generally considered outmoded as a method of reading education when not used in conjunction with phonics. Nevertheless, the books remain on sale in 2013, priced relatively cheaply at around £2.99 per book.
Worldwide sales.
In some Asian countries, particularly those which are also part of the British Commonwealth, the books are still widely used as a teaching aid in nurseries, preschools and kindergartens.

Eddie Gale

Edward Gale Stevens Jr. (August 15, 1941 – July 10, 2020), known professionally as Eddie Gale, was an American trumpeter known for his work in free jazz, especially with the Sun Ra Arkestra.
Life and career.
Born in Brooklyn, New York on August 15, 1941, Gale studied trumpet with Kenny Dorham. He recorded with Cecil Taylor, Sun Ra, Larry Young, and Elvin Jones, and performed with John Coltrane, Jackie McLean, Booker Ervin, and Illinois Jacquet. In the early 1960s he was introduced to Sun Ra by drummer Scoby Stroman. He spent many hours exposed to Sun Ra's philosophy about music and life. Eddie explains, "Playing with Sun Ra is a great experience--from the known to the unknown. You play ideas on your instrument that you never imagine. His music provoked me to explore the use of trills, for instance, and the placement of whole tones and then a space chord--ideas you do not find in the exercise books."
During the 1960s and 1970s, he toured and recorded extensively with Sun Ra, who influenced him greatly until Ra's death in 1993. After a yearlong stint as artist in residence at Stanford University, Gale moved to San Jose, California in 1972.
Helping to bring jazz into the 21st century, the trumpeter made numerous appearances with Oakland hip-hop outfit The Coup, whereby Gale's trumpet could be heard engaging with the music's breakbeats and turntables.
Eddie Gale died on July 10, 2020, at the age of 78.

Palla (garment)

The palla was an elegant cloak or mantle that was wrapped around the body. It was worn outside the house by (affluent) Roman women. It was a luxurious version of the Roman men's "pallium". The "palla" was a traditional ancient Roman mantle worn by women, fastened by brooches. The shape was rectangular instead of semi-circular, as with the traditional toga. The garment dates to the 3rd century BC, but the type of dress must be much older. In Latin literature, the term "palla" is used ambiguously. It can denote not only a cloak, but also a foot-length sleeveless dress with straps (or a brooch) worn directly on the skin. The second is a common dress form in the entire Mediterranean world. In a Greek cultural context, this is called "peplos". In a Roman cultural context, if worn by a Roman matron, it also takes the name "stola".

No Angels discography

The discography of German girl group No Angels consists of six studio albums, three compilation albums, two live albums, four video albums, two extended plays and more than twenty singles. The group sold over five million records before breaking up in 2003, making them one of the highest-selling German girl groups of all time as well as one of the most successful acts in German music history.
In February 2001, the band released their debut single, "Daylight in Your Eyes," which reached number one in Germany for six consecutive weeks, and topped the charts in Austria and Switzerland. The group's debut album, "Elle'ments", was released by Polydor in association with Zeitgeist and Cheyenne Records the following month and topped the German Albums Chart for three weeks, eventually being certified 7× gold. The album also reached number one in Austria and Switzerland, going platinum in both countries. The album spawned three more top ten singles, including a cover of Eurythmics' "There Must Be an Angel," another number one hit. The band's second album, "Now... Us!", debuted and peaked at number one in Germany in June 2002. It produced four singles, two of which reached the top five in Germany, including their third number one single in Germany and Austria, "Something About Us". Preceded by their fourth number-one single, "No Angel (It's All in Your Mind)" and top five single "Someday", the group's third album, "Pure", was released in August 2003. Their first album as a quartet, it was certified gold. The album spawned one more single, "Feelgood Lies", which reached number three in Germany. In September 2003, the group announced that they were splitting up and released one final album, "The Best of No Angels", a greatest hits album with all of their singles, in December 2003. It peaked at number five in Germany for two weeks. 
No Angels re-formed in 2007 and released their fourth studio album, "Destiny", through Universal Records in April of the same year. Commercially less successful than their previous albums, it peaked at number four in Germany, becoming their first studio album not to reach the top spot. Although the singles from "Destiny" failed to match the success of its preceders, it produced two top five hits with the comeback single "Goodbye to Yesterday" and the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2008, "Disappear." The band's second post-reunion album, "Welcome to the Dance", was released in September 2009. It peaked at number twenty-six, lasting two weeks in the German albums chart, and became their lowest-charting and selling album up to then. Its first and only single "One Life" peaked at number fifteen in Germany. In September 2010, band member Nadja Benaissa left the band, leaving No Angels as a trio before they went into another hiatus. In early 2021, the band reformed once more as a quartet, commemorating with their 2001 debut. Their sixth studio album "20", a collection of re-recordings and new songs, was released by BMG Rights Management in June 2021 and became their four non-consecutive number-one album on the German Albums Chart.

Ryōgoku Kokugikan

, also known as Ryōgoku Sumo Hall or Kokugikan Arena, is the name bestowed to two different indoor sporting arenas located in Tokyo. The first "Ryōgoku Kokugikan" opened its doors in 1909 and was located on the premises of the Ekōin temple in Ryōgoku, Tokyo. Although no sumo bouts were held after 1945, following the capitulation of Japan and the requisition of the building by the occupying forces, the building itself remained active until 1983, being notably used by the Nihon University. The second "Ryōgoku Kokugikan" is currently located in the Yokoami neighborhood of Sumida next to the Edo-Tokyo Museum. It opened in 1985, following the closure of the Kuramae Kokugikan, and is still in use today.
The first Ryōgoku Kokugikan.
History.
The growing popularity of Sumo during the Meiji period led to the building of the original Kokugikan in Ryōgoku. Until then, Sumo bouts were performed in temples precincts and depended on the weather. In March 1906, the 22nd Imperial Diet decided to build an indoor sumo facility within the precincts of the Ekōin temple in Ryōgoku. The task was given to two of the most predominant architects in Japan at the time, Tatsuno Kingo and (mostly known for the Bank of Japan, the Hamadera Park Station or the Tokyo Station). Inspired by western architecture, the building is Japan's first dome-shaped steel framed building. Construction began in June 1906 and the arena was quickly nicknamed because of the large roof resembling a huge umbrella. Although it was a Western-style building, the roof imitated the "kondo" (centerpiece) of Horyuji Temple. The opening ceremony was held on June 2, 1909.
Originally set to be called "Shobukan" ("lit." Home of Martial Arts) by the founding committee chairman Itagaki Taisuke, the building took the name of Kokugikan ("lit." National Sports Hall) thanks to another member of the committee, writer Suiin Emi.
The arena was thought to accommodate 13,000 people, including about 1,000 square seats. The inner diameter of the building was 62m, and the central height was 25m. In 1931, the Japan Sumo Association decided to replace the old Irimoya-zukuri style roof of the ring with a Shinmei-zukuri style roof.
The building of the Ryōgoku Kokugikan consecrated the evolution of Sumo from a Shinto ritual to a national sport.
Fire and earthquake, war damage and requisition.
The first "Kokugikan" suffered extensive damage during its years of service.
In November 1917, during the series of big fires in Tokyo. The arena burned down due to the accidental fire and its large roof collapsed. The Ryōgoku Kokugikan was destroyed for the first time and needed to be built from scrap. The total amount of damage amounted to about 1.2 million yen and the tournaments had to be held at the Yasukuni Shrine until the arena was rebuilt in January 1920, notably using zinc to fortify the roof.
Three years later, in September 1923, the Ryōgoku Kokugikan was destroyed in the Great Kantō earthquake and tournaments had to be held at the Butokuden lot in Nagoya.
In February 1944, the Kokugikan was requisitioned by the military and turned into a balloon bomb factory. The Summer tournament was therefore held at the Korakuen Stadium (sekitori) and Meiji Jingu Stadium (Makushita and below).
In March 1945, an air raid over Tokyo damaged the Ryōgoku Kokugikan and the surrounding sumo stables. After the war, the Kokugikan was occupied by the allies forces and the "budo ban" was enforced, preventing tournaments until November. As the arena was requisitioned by the allies, the Kokugikan undergone a new phase of restoration and was renamed Ryogoku Memorial Hall. The renovations were completed by September 1946 leaving the November 1945 tournament to a burnt-out Kokugikan. The November tournament of 1946 was the last tournament to occur in the arena.
Post sumo venues.
Since then, the Kokugikan has been used for roller skating, professional boxing and professional wrestling. Japan's first public wrestling match was held at the Memorial Hall on September 30, 1951. It was also used as the venue for the All Japan Judo Championships in May 1951.
In 1958, the former Kokugikan (Ryōgoku, Sumida Ward) was purchased from the Japan Sumo Association by the Nihon University, to create a large auditorium that could hold unified ceremonies such as entrance ceremonies and graduation ceremonies throughout the university. The Memorial Hall was therefore renamed . During the Zenkyōtō the auditorium was used as a conference room for the protest rally.
Due to aging equipment, notably failing to meet fire protection regulations, the building was dismantled in 1983. After the demolition, the complex building facility "Ryogoku City Core" and other offices, residences, and restaurants were built. In the courtyard, the location of the "dohyō" of the former Kokugikan is indicated by a circle on the ground.
The second Ryōgoku Kokugikan.
The second Ryōgoku Kokugikan opened as the aging Kuramae Kokugikan became less practical due to modernization problems. Therefore, the Japan Sumo Association sought to purchase a new location to build a new arena.
History.
Considering a move to the location of a defunct freight rail yard next to Ryōgoku Station, the Japan Sumo Association began to hold consultations with the Japanese National Railways (JNR) in June 1977. Faced with large deficits at the time, JNR was receptive to the idea of selling the property, aided by its belief that if the new Kokugikan was built next to the station, the number of passengers served would increase. As the land in Kuramae was selected as a candidate site for the construction of a sewage treatment plant in Tokyo, the association acquired the means to purchase the land located in Ryōgoku. The move to Ryōgoku was decided in 1980, and in March 1982, a land purchase contract was concluded between JNR and the Sumo Association. The cost of purchasing the land in Ryōgoku was 9.4 billion yen, while the Sumo Association was able to sell its Kuramae property to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government for 14.3 billion yen. A total of 15 billion yen was procured for the construction of the new arena, comprising the 4.9 billion yen profit from the real estate transactions, 9.6 billion yen the Sumo Association had set aside in reserves, and a 500 million yen subsidy from the Ministry of Education. As the project to build a new arena progressed, the overall picture of a Kokugikan which made full use of modern technology was solidified. The construction faced heavy challenges in terms of cost and construction period as the Sumo Association requested that the construction be shortened by half a year, in place of the two years initially planned, and completed by January 1985.
On September 20, 1982, plans for the new Kokugikan were announced during a press conference. The new arena would be made of three floors above ground and two underground. The total floor area is 35,700 m2 and the seating capacity is 11,098. The ring and the square seats on the first floor are movable and can be stored for multi-purpose use, so that they can be used effectively outside the 45 days of the annual sumo competition.
A ground breaking ceremony was held on April 27, 1983. Both "yokozuna" Kitanoumi and "yokozuna" Chiyonofuji performed a "yokozuna dohyō-iri" as part of the Shinto ceremony. On January 9, 1985, the inauguration ceremony and unveiling party were held with 2,300 people in attendance. Following a solemn ritual, both yokozuna performed a "yokozuna dohyō-iri", "ōzeki" Wakashimazu and Asashio performed a Shinto sumo ritual (called ) and "yokozuna" Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi performed a very rare ceremony.
Technical specifications.
The planned construction site for the new Kokugikan is a place prone to urban floods, therefore the introduction of a rainwater utilization system for the Kokugikan was asked by the Sumida municipality. The roof area is 8,360 m2. Rainwater is stored in an underground 1,000 m3 rainwater tank, and 70% of miscellaneous water used at the Kokugikan is covered by this rainwater. In the event of an earthquake, this water can be used as emergency domestic water. When a heavy snowfall falls, this rainwater can be ejected from the headdress on the roof to melt the snow. The ring is illuminated by 124 lights for TV broadcasts, and the angles of each are adjusted so as not to interfere with the wrestlers' mental unity and to prevent halation caused by the wrestlers' sweat. In addition, since Japanese people have dark hair, the lighting in the audience seats on the background of the ring is adjusted so that the colors appearing on the TV screen are not dark. The Ryōgoku Kokugikan houses the offices of the Japan Sumo Association and, at the rear of building, the "Sumo School" where new recruits must complete a six-month course on various topics such as calligraphy, sports science, sumo history and civics in addition to sumo's basic movements and techniques. Near the main entrance, two Inari shrines (called Toyokuni Inari and Shusse Inari) are dedicated to wrestlers safety and success. Originally the twin-shrines were built in the backyard of the former Ryōgoku Kokugikan and were relocated in 1963 in the Kuramae Kokugikan before finally moving to their current location. The arena also includes a number of dedicated venues such as the Sumo Museum, restaurants or a banquet hall for chankonabe tasting. 
 Emblematic venues also includes the "Annaijo" Entrance ("lit." Information desk, also called "Chaya-dori": Tea House Street), a flower-theme decorated corridor for souvenirs buying. Now under the control of the Japan Sumo Association, the "cha-ya" were originally independent named teahouses that sold tickets and refreshments to their customers. Following a system of inheritance, today's 20 businesses can be dated back to the nineteenth century, the oldest teahouse dating back to 1818. Now the teahouses also offer gifts packages. Their services usually go to regular customers who have agreements in place. Attendants (called "dekata") dressed in attire that resembles a yobidashi, guide patrons to their seats and supply them with refreshments in exchange of a tip.
The Ryōgoku Kokugikan also has its own yakitori skewers factory in the basement of the building.
Sumo.
For its first tournament, the Ryōgoku Kokugikan was visited by Emperor Shōwa. It was the first time Tenran-sumo was performed on the first day of the first tournament of the year. The January 1985 tournament also marked a milestone in Sumo as "yokozuna" Chiyonofuji achieved a while "yokozuna" Kitanoumi (who had been "yokozuna" for 10 years) announced his retirement on the third day of the tournament after three consecutives defeats.
Since its completion, the Ryōgoku Kokugikan is the place where every Tokyo tournaments are held in January, May and September. The arena also holds other sumo related events such as retirement ceremonies, known as danpatsu-shiki, where sekitori-ranked wrestlers ritually cut their topknot in a long and solemn ceremony. Only "sekitori" with at least 30 tournaments in the top division can qualify for a ceremony at the Kokugikan, other wrestlers usually perform the ceremony at hotels or in their stable. "Kanreki dohyō-iri" ceremonies, where former "yokozuna" celebrate their sixtieth birthday during a particular "yokozuna dohyō-iri" ceremony, are also usually held at the Kokugikan.
The Kokugikan also holds sumo events for boys such as the Goodwill Sumo Tournament, and high-school championships, such as the National Junior High School Sumo Tournament. The arena also regularly hold the All Japan Sumo Championships (Japan Sumo Federation main event) and Hakuhō Cup (a children's sumo event).
Also, prior to each Tokyo tournaments, willing wrestlers will meet in joint training in the training room of the Sumo School for four to six days. These trainings are usually in presence of the press and "oyakata". Finally, the public broadcast company NHK hold in the Kokugikan its own Sumo event, called the . Taking place each February, this charity event has been held since 1966. It takes the form of a festival where traditional jungyo activities are performed (sumo wrestlers songs, "yokozuna's tsuna" exhibition, "makuuchi" bouts). The profits are donated to social care institutions across the country.
Other sports.
Like the Kuramae Kokugikan, the Ryōgoku Kokugikan hosted a number of professional wrestling events as soon as its first year of service. In September 1985, the first wrestling card, promoted by All Japan Pro Wrestling, happened with the first Japanese appearance of the Road Warriors. In December of the same year, New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) held its first card in the Ryogoku. It became a regular venue for NJPW's events such as the G1 Climax. In 1998, Antonio Inoki's Universal Fighting-Arts Organization held its first card at the arena. As All Japan began to use the Nippon Budokan as its main venue, the Ryōgoku Kokugikan became established as a venue for rival promotion NJPW. In 2009, DDT Pro-Wrestling held its first event in the arena. World Wonder Ring Stardom has held multiple events in Ryōgoku beginning in 2013. WWE also held numerous events in the Ryōgoku between 2010 and 2015, the latest being WWE's The Beast in the East. Other promotions to have held an event at the venue include Super World of Sports, UWF International, Fighting Network Rings, All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling, Wrestle and Romance, JWP Joshi Puroresu, Michinoku Pro Wrestling, Tokyo Pro Wrestling, Battlarts, Pro Wrestling Zero1, World Japan, Hustle, Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling, Inoki Genome Federation, Dragongate, Pro Wrestling Noah, Wrestle-1, Big Japan Pro Wrestling, Tenryu Project, Tokyo Joshi Pro-Wrestling, Gleat, and Dream Star Fighting Marigold.
The Kokugikan also host Boxing competitions including the hosting of the boxing competition at the 2020 Summer Olympics. In 2025, it will also host Capcom Cup 11, a Street Fighter 6 championship event for Capcom Pro Tour 2024.
Other events.
In 1992, The Kokugikan hosted the very first official "Street Fighter II" tournament. On April 4, 2014, the K-pop boy group Got7 held their first Japanese showcase in the venue. In 2017 it hosted Ferrari's 70th anniversary celebrations. Paul McCartney performed a concert at the venue as part of his world tour "Freshen Up" on November 5, 2018.
In May 2021 the stadium was used as a vaccination center for the COVID-19 vaccine, with some retired sumo wrestlers among those getting vaccinated.
Transportation links.
The arena is served by the Ryōgoku Station with platforms to the south and east of the arena. The JR East Chūō-Sōbu Line platforms to the south are served by local trains while rapid trains bypass the platforms by going through a tunnel north of the platforms. The two main platforms are built as an island platform, with trains heading west to Tokyo and east to Chiba, while there is a third terminal platform that is only used on special event days. The Toei Subway Ōedo Line platforms lie in a north–south axis directly underneath Kiyosumi Street to the east of the arena. There are regular trains to Iidabashi and Tochomae from platform 1 and Daimon and Roppongi from platform 2.

WPLY (Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania)

WPLY (960 AM) was a radio station licensed to serve Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, United States. It was owned by Nassau Broadcasting Partners.
It broadcast a news/talk radio format, simulcasting with WVPO (840 AM) in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.
History.
The station originally signed on in April 1981 as WPCN. The locally owned community station was notably innovative at the time for installing serial #1 of the Continental Model 314R1 PWM transmitter, which ushered in an era of enhanced audio fidelity and efficient, power-saving operation. (It has since been replaced with a Harris Gates One.) The four towers, employing elevated feeds, were guyed with non-conductive Phillystran cable, also innovative at the time.
It was assigned the WPLY call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on March 10, 2005.
In January 2012, the Federal Communications Commission issued a notice of apparent liability and proposed a $17,000 fine against Nassau Broadcasting II, stating WPLY "willfully and repeatedly violated" FCC regulations. It stemmed from a random inspection at WPLY's facilities in March 2010, when it was discovered the station had been transmitting from only one of its four antennas at greatly reduced power (250 watts) without receiving authorization, and had been doing so since Nassau purchased the station in 2000. FCC regulations require that stations unable to operate at full power must apply for a temporary authorization to operate at reduced power, which WPLY did only after the 2010 inspection, claiming that the station's antenna array was "severely deteriorated" and in need of extensive repairs.
The notice also stated that WPLY did not maintain an FCC-required public file, and that station personnel claimed they had never kept such a file.
WPLY left the air June 27, 2011 to determine if its antenna system needed to be repaired or replaced. It never resumed broadcasting, and on March 6, 2014 its license was canceled for failure to broadcast for a year.
The towers were dismantled and removed in early 2019, and the site, at the intersection of Interstates 380 and 80, has remained vacant.

Development regions of Nepal

Prior to the promulgation of a new constitution in 2015 after an earthquake, Nepal was divided into five development regions (), 14 administrative zones () and 77 districts (). The 14 administrative zones were grouped into five development regions. Each district is headed by a Chief District Officer (CDO) responsible for maintaining law and order and coordinating the work of field agencies of the various government ministries.

Prefaces

Prefaces () is a book by Søren Kierkegaard published under the pseudonym Nicolaus Notabene. The meaning of the pseudonym used for "Prefaces", Nicholaus Notabene, was best summed up in his work "Writing Sampler", where Kierkegaard said twice for emphasis, “Please read the following preface, because it contains things of the utmost importance.” He was trying to tell his critics to read the preface to his books because they have the key to understanding them. Nota bene is Latin for "note well".
Context.
"Prefaces" was published June 17, 1844, the same date as "The Concept of Anxiety" (also by a pseudonym: Vigilius Haufniensis). This was the second time Kierkegaard published his works on the same date, (the first being Oct 16, 1843, with the publication of "Repetition" alongside "Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843" and "Fear and Trembling"). Kierkegaard published 14 separate works between the publication of "Either/Or" on February 20, 1843 and "Four Upbuilding Discourses" which he published on August 31, 1844.
Kierkegaard contrasted one fictional author with another frequently. This book and its companion piece, "The Concept of Anxiety", contrasts Notabene, who is mediated by his wife as well as his reviewer, with Haufniensis, who is against his knowledge of sin being mediated by Adam.
Nicolaus Notabene is a married man who wants to be a writer. His new wife becomes suspicious and forces him to vow to write only prefaces. It is a series of prefaces for unwritten books, books unwritten because the fictitious Notabene's wife has sworn to divorce him if he ever becomes a writer. But for Notabene writing a preface is just a prelude to an act, it’s “like sharpening a scythe or like tuning a guitar”. He tried flattering his wife by telling her she is the “muse who inspires him,” but she says, “Either a properly married man or …” He “promises not to insist on being an author.” Since he wants to live in the “literary world” he makes sure he lives up to the “custom” of the “sacred vow”. 
He writes prefaces about “the reading public's” relationship to an author. The author has to “live in public view” once she publishes a book. Notabene then attacks reviewers of books in general, calling them “the highly trusted minions of the most esteemed public, its cupbearers and privy counselors" and the reviewers of his books, "Either/Or" and "Repetition", Johan Ludvig Heiberg and Hans Lassen Martensen in particular. Kierkegaard was complaining because his books weren't being read, they were being mediated. He says, “a rumor carries away the reading public as the muse’s impulse the poet, since like always effects like.” And the rumor was that all theologians should be philosophers. Kierkegaard put it this way. 
Notabene makes fun of Hieberg because Hieberg seems to want to explain everything, just like Hegel. Both want to be mediators of understanding. But Notabene says,My frame, my health, my entire constitution do not lend themselves to mediation. It may well be that this is a flaw, but when I myself confess it, surely one might humor me. When the word “mediation” is merely mentioned everything becomes so magnificent and grandiose that I do not feel well but am oppressed and chafed. Have compassion on me in only this one respect; exempt me from mediation and, what is a necessary consequence, from becoming the innocent occasion that would cause one or another philosophical prattler to repeat, like a child at the chancel step, something I indeed know well enough: the history of modern philosophy’s beginning with Descartes, and the philosophical fairy tale about how being and nothing combine their deficiencies so that becoming emerges from it, along with whatever other amazing things happened later in the continuation of the tale, which is very animated and moving although it is not a tale but a purely logical movement. "Prefaces" p. 45
Vigilius Haufniensis says the same thing in "The Concept of Anxiety", 
Criticism.
Georg Brandes discussed both Heiberg and Kierkegaard in his 1886 book, "Eminent Authors of the Nineteenth Century. Literary Portraits" Though he started in his general aesthetic views on the career pointed out by Heiberg, he nevertheless struck ere long into his own independent course. Heiberg was only a moralist in the name of true culture and of good taste; Paludan-Muller became one in the name of stern religious discipline. In religious questions, Heiberg had espoused the cause of Hegelian speculative Christianity; Paludan-Muller became an orthodox theologian. Thus his path for not an inconsiderable distance ran parallel with that of Søren Kierkegaard. Not that he was in any way influenced by this solitary thinker. He cherished but little sympathy for him, and was repelled by his broad, unclassical form, for whose merits he had no comprehension, and whose inner harmony with the mind of the author he did not perceive. It was the general spirit of the times which produced the intellectual harmony of these two solitary chastisers of their contemporaries. p. 321 Kierkegaard speaks of the "cultured" in this way, "For the cultured it is truly too little to have to deal with an individual human being, even though that human being is himself. He does not want to be disturbed when he is to be built up, does not want to be reminded of all the trifles, of individuals, of himself, because to forget all this is precisely the upbuilding."

Augsburger Puppenkiste

The Augsburger Puppenkiste (German for: Augsburg Puppetchest) is a marionette theater in Augsburg, Germany.
It is located at the former Heilig-Geist-Spital in the historic center of Augsburg. Since 1948, the "Augsburger Puppenkiste" had been producing theatrical adaptations of fairy tales and serious pieces. In 1953, it began producing television series and gained nationwide prominence with productions, such as "Jim Knopf und Lukas der Lokomotivführer" and "Urmel aus dem Eis".
The "Puppenkiste" (puppet chest): A family business.
In 1943, Walter Oehmichen (1901–1977) founded his own small puppet theater together with his wife Rose Oehmichen (1901–1985) and their daughters Hannelore (1931–2003) and Ulla: the "Puppenschrein", a puppet theatre which consisted of a small wooden stage that could be set up in a door frame. In the night of February 26, 1944, this stage was destroyed in a fire following a bomb assault in Augsburg. The figures, however, remained undamaged - luckily Walter Oehmichen took them home after performing for the kids of the stage members in the city theatre of Augsburg. Both the city theatre and the Puppenschrein within were almost completely destroyed by flames. Today, only one ornament from the original shrine is left.
After the war, Walter Oehmichen began planning a new puppet theatre. At the former Heilig-Geist Hospital, he found a room to perform his shows. First, however, Oehmichen had to share the premises with the city’s Office of Statistics.
Despite all odds of the post-war period, the Oehmichen family was able to re-open the marionette theater as "Augsburger Puppenkiste" with the play "Der gestiefelte Kater" (Puss in Boots) on 26 February 1948 – exactly four years after the puppet shrine was destroyed. The first puppeteers and speakers were young actors from Augsburg – among others, Manfred Jenning. He would soon become the staff writer for the "Augsburger Puppenkiste" and in 1951 he established the year-end puppet cabaret show for adults, which has since become a yearly tradition. The first cabaret premiere was on 31 December 1950.
At first, Walter Oehmichen whittled the puppets himself, but he soon passed this important job on to his daughter Hannelore. She created all the puppets which would soon be well known as the "stars on strings". Hannelore whittled her first puppet at the age of 13. She had to keep her work a secret, because at this time she wasn’t allowed to use the sharp woodcarving knife. The first of her puppets to become famous was The Little Prince (a character from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's famous novel). In the first public performance of the "Puppenkiste", Puss in Boots, Hannelore was responsible for manipulating Puss. Oehmichens wife Rose made all the clothes for the marionettes and lent her voice to many of the mother and grandmother characters.
In 1973, following the 25th anniversary of the Puppenkiste, Hannelore and her husband Hanns-Joachim Marschall took over the management. Hanns-Joachim Marschall, who was an actor, had already worked for the "Puppenkiste" in previous years. Walter Oehmichen died in 1977, but up to his death he supported the theatre. Rose Oehmichen died in 1985. Following Rose Oehmichens death, her daughter Hannelore inherited the "Puppenkiste".
Since the beginning of the 1980s Klaus Marschall, the son of Hannelore and Hanns-Joachim Marschall, has been working in the theater. He took over the management from his parents in 1992. Hanns-Joachim Marschall retired from the theater and died in 1999. His wife Hannelore, however, continued to carve the figures and supported the theater again and again. Klaus's brother Jürgen stepped into/entered the business at the beginning of the 1990s/ got involved in the Puppenkiste in the 1990s and helped his mother to produce the puppets. He accepted her inheritance after her death on May 16, 2003. In the course of years the space at the Rotes-Tor building became too small for the theater. Within the means of the reconstruction of the Heilig-Geist-Spital and plans for the park Kulturpark Rotes Tor further premises were provided by the city of Augsburg in 2000. A new theatre hall, which is located exactly opposite to the old one, was established and opened in October 2000. In 2004, the "Augsburger Puppenkiste" won the Golden Camera, a well-known German film award.
The origin of the name "Augsburger Puppenkiste" and the famous box tops.
The name "Puppenkiste" (puppet box or puppet chest) goes back to the founder of the theatre, Walter Oehmichen. When his first puppet theatre was destroyed in a fire, he wanted to create a new one which was easily transportable. He came up with the idea of a wooden transport box, in which he stored all of his puppets and the actual puppet theatre.
The wooden box not only features prominently in the name of the theatre, but also inspired the trade mark of the "Puppenkiste": the representation of the two top cover flaps of a wooden box. Across the top covers, the name "Augsburger Puppenkiste" is printed, along with the addition "Oehmichens marionette theatre". These box lids have long since become the official trade mark of the "Puppenkiste". Every single film or theatre-production starts with a small sequence of the top covers being opened. In the actual theatre, the stage is covered by two enormous box lids (0,90x 2 metres). For the TV productions, special cover flaps were produced: they are smaller and modeled to fit the screen format with the aspect ratio 4:3. These very box tops were used mostly unchanged since the end of the 1950s in almost all TV productions of the "Puppenkiste". For the production of "Der Raub der Mitternachtssonne" (The theft of the midnight sun) (1994), a so-called "Insertkasten" (insert box) was designed to fit the screen aspect ratio of 16:9, which is respectively longer than the usual 4:3 format.
Only the programs done entirely by the "Puppenkiste", or those that were supposed to stand out from regular productions of the Hessischer Rundfunk (Hessian broadcasting), would do without the famous box tops with their high recognition value. Worth mentioning are the numerous episodes for the German kids' program Sandmännchen (little sandman) (1962–1982), 'Die Museumsratten' (the museum rats) (1965–1972), 'Ich wünsch' mir was' (I'm wishing for something) (1968–1971), 'Wir Schildbürger' (1972), 'Natur und Technik' (nature and technology) (1972–1976) and Ralphi (2004–2006).
Theater.
Plays for children.
Many classical fairy tales are played in the Puppenkiste, not only from the Brothers Grimm but also tales from One thousand and One Nights or Wilhelm Hauff. For decades, plays like Aladdin and his Wonderful Lamp, Little Longnose or Mother Hulda are performed, often new adaptions/ productions are staged. The most popular plays The Robber Hotzenplotz (1966) or The Little Witch (1971) – both created by Otfried Preußler – are put on stage unchanged since their first production.
Plays/shows for adults.
The "Puppenkiste" also showed and is still showing many adaptations for adults. Öhmichen staged many plays which he initially was not able to put on stage, like A Dream Play, in the city theater of Augsburg, where he used to work as a director. While the small puppetry had to struggle hard with its first publications, it made its significant breakthrough with the staging of Antoine de Saint-Exupèry’s "The Little Prince" on February 26, 1951.
Walter Öhmichen himself slipped into the role of the narrating pilot.
The premiere of Berthold Brecht’s "The Threepenny Opera" in the "Puppenkiste" in Augsburg on September 25, 1960, was spectacular. Again Öhmichen himself was performing, this time as a balladeer. The poet of the play died four years ago in Cold War times in the GDR and was a rather infamous citizen. Also, "Der Prozess um des Esels Schatten" (The trial over the donkey’s shadow) from 1962 by Friedrich Dürrenmatt again and again appears in the program.
But the "Puppenkiste" does not only stage serious and funny plays and classics such as Dr. Johann Georg Faust; operas and other musical works, preferably from Mozart, are performed, too. Already in 1952, Walter Oehmichen directed some works, in which music features prominently. So he staged Peter and the Wolf by Sergei Prokofiev, a symphonic fairy-tale for children, as well as Bastien und Bastienne, a comic opera composed by Mozart. In 1985, the theatre staged another one of Mozart's works: The Magic Flute. The opera was adapted for marionettes by Walter Oehmichens son-in-law, Hanns-Joachim Marschall. In the course of the adaption, Marschall slightly changed the opera, cutting out long arias. He also engaged actors with trained singing voices to speak and sing the parts of the characters. Thus, every puppet had a double cast: a manipulator and a speaker. The same strategy was used for the adaption of Mozart’s The Abduction from the Seraglio in 1991.
In 2005, the year preceding Mozart’s 250th birthday, the opera Don Giovanni was produced by Klaus Marschall under the title "Don Giovanni and the stone visitor". The part of Don Giovanni’s servant was represented by a Kasperl puppet (a puppet character similar to Punch), who spiced up the opera by his wit and comic escapades.
Alongside the productions aimed at a young audience, the "Augsburger Puppenkiste" successfully stages several productions for adults. Every year, a pantomime show is a popular part of the repertoire. The new pantomime traditionally premieres on New Year’s Eve, and is performed about a hundred times during the following six months.
TV productions.
As of 1953 the Augsburger Puppenkiste gained popularity throughout Germany: Only a few weeks after the premier of the Tagesschau, aired the first television programme showing the tale of Peter and the Wolf on 21 January. The show was reenacted in the Bunker of the NWDR in Hamburg and was broadcast live due to the lack of recording technology. So were the following shows which were produced by the Hessische Rundfunk in the Frankfurt television studios until 1954. Since the HR dropped its children's programme between 1956 and 1959, the Bayerische Rundfunk was another stop along the way of the Puppenkiste. However, after the relaunch HR offered the in-house writer Manfred Jenning to realize the concept of a series ("Die Geschichte der Muminfamilie") and the Puppenkiste returned to its original station.
While the first TV productions of the Augsburger Puppenkiste were mere recordings of theatre productions, they soon turned into elaborate motion pictures/ movies/ (feature) films. On every day of the filming, only three to four minutes of actual film were produced. Because of the spot lights, the temperature in the temporary studio went up to around 60 °C, and so the job/ filming literally brought the sweat to the brows of the manipulators. From then on/ because of that, the filming took no longer place in the temporary studio (anyone knows if that was still the bunker?/ dugout?), but in the lobby/ foyer of the Augsburger Puppenkiste theatre. Manfred Henning did not only write the scripts for the films, but also worked as/ functioned as (the) director. It was under his direction, that the recorded theatre productions turned into films, which tapped the full potential of 1960s film production/ the 1960s filmmaking/ filmmaking at the time. The TV series soon became independent projects and were thus separated from the theatre productions. This is the reason why the famous TV stars were never actually seen on stage in Augsburg.
The classics.
Many of early productions are today ranked among the classics. One of them is the first-ever film series of the Puppenkiste, which was produced in 1959. "The Moomin Family" (after the Books of Tove Jansson) consisted of six sequels, which were broadcast during the 1959 Christmas season. The first series was soon followed by a second one, "Summer in Moominvalley", produced in 1960. Two series of "Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver" ("Jim Knopf und Lukas der Lokomotivführer") were filmed and released in 1961 and 1962 respectively. The early films were filmed in black and white, but the success of the Jim Button series led to a remake in 1976 filmed in colour.
Other early productions of the Puppenkiste were "The little fat Knight" ("Der kleine dicke Ritter", 1963), an adaptation of Robert Bolt's play "The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew ", "Splashy the Squid" (1963), by whose careless behaviour nearly everything was destroyed, and "The Tomcat Mikesch" (1964, based on a book by Josef Lada). The Puppenkiste was produced by Hessian television broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk from 1954 until a dispute over the rights to DVD licensing ended the relationship after 40 years. Between 1956 and 1958, the Puppenkiste worked with the Bavarian television broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk. The Puppenkiste has been in colour since 1965. One of the best known and most popular productions of this period was probably "Impy's Island" ("Urmel aus dem Eis") from 1969. Audiences have also loved the "Lion trilogy" (1965–1967), "The Robber Hotzenplotz" (1967), and "Bill Bo" (1968). Max Kruse became one of the authors whose works were most often made into films. He provided the source material for "The Lion is on the loose", "The Lion comes flying" and "Well roared, Lion", as well as for another Impy film, "Impy is playing in the castle" (1974). He also provided the source material for "Don Tin", "The Golden Squire" (1973), and the Wild West adventure "Lord Battershirt" (1978).
The 1980s/90s.
Sepp Strubel succeeded Jenning as the TV producer of the Augsburger Puppenkiste. Since the early 1960s Strubel had already worked as a narrator for the Puppenkiste. With the shows "Nature and Technology" and "Think and Thought" (1972–1976), he had also created and realised his own scientific magazine series for children in which the Puppenkiste puppets featured. Instead of employing well-known authors that had already provided the Puppenkiste with successes, Strubel hired young authors for the television adaptations:In 1980, the „Opodeldkoks“ was made after a novel by Paul Maar, and in 1982, The Cat with the Hat was filmed. The universe became a new destination for Strubel: First he went to the Apfelstern („apple star“) ("Fünf auf dem Apfelstern" („five on the apple star“), 1981) and in 1986/87, the little robot Schlupp came from the green star to the Earth (script: Ellis Kaut).
On April 16, 1983, a scheduled performance had to be aborted after its beginning because in the TV show Wetten dass...?, which was just taking place in Augsburg, a bet had been made that a performance of the puppets on short notice was not possible.
Some of the puppeteers took some of the most famous puppets to the show, which was broadcast on the channel ZDF, so that they unexpectedly appeared on television on that day. In 1994 another TV production was realised in cooperation with the “Hessischer Rundfunk” – the last cooperation for the time being: Strubel did no longer function as director for “The Robbing of the Midnight Sun”. He only wrote the screenplay- just like he did for “Lülü the Castle Ghost” (1992) and “Schmollo the Wizard” (1993).
In 1997, a film based on the novel "A Rat's Tale" by the American children’s book author Tor Seidler brought the Augsburger Puppenkiste to the big screen. About 900,000 cinema goers watched (rat-) puppets and humans interacting in New York’s harbour and gangland areas. The film, directed by Michael F. Huse, was awarded the Bavarian Film Award in the category best children’s movie.
Since the year 2000.
In 2000/01 a new TV series was produced: "Lilalu im Schepperland" (a total of thirteen episodes) relates the adventures the princess of the fairy tale singing country Melodania, the court kitchen gnome Pimpernell and the crow Lukulla have to face while fighting the mighty witch Synkopia, the Red Goblin and other witches and wizards. The script to the series, which is based on Enid Blyton’s “Book of Brownies”, was written by Peter Scheerbaum, the in-staff writer of the Augsburger Puppenkiste. He was already (involved in) working on the script of “The Story of Monty Spinnerratz”.
The latest television project of the Puppenkiste is “Ralphi”, which was first realized in 2005/2006. Ralphi is a bear puppet, who is going on journeys into the real world to explore new things. The program Ralphi runs on the kids channel of the Bavarian television broadcast (Bayrischer Rundfunk, BR). Every time, he sets out from the Augsburger Puppenkiste and travels all over Bavaria investigating how businesses work and explaining it to children. For the Christmas time, he explores the tradition of gifts and Christmas cribs and visits a factory which produces firework rockets.
The Puppenkiste also produces documentaries, which are aimed (both) at children and adults. The documentary “Augusta Kasperlicorum”, which was produced in 2004, Kasperl/ Punch presents his home city, Augsburg to the audience. During the Mozart year in 2006, “Augusta Mozarteum” was filmed. In this documentary Kasperl finds out things about the famous composer, whose father was born in Augsburg – just like Kasperl/ Punch. Both documentaries were, however, only released on DVD.
The Puppenkiste went back to its roots by producing a film version of the cabaret/ pantomime show. On New Year’s Eve 2005, a “best of” version of the current pantomime show was filmed on the stage of the Augsburger Puppenkiste theatre. From April 2006 on, different songs from the cabaret are presented as a musical interlude on the TV channel BR-alpha under the title of “poetics of amazement”.
The Puppenkiste on tour.
For their fiftieth anniversary, the Augburger Puppenkiste toured Germany for two years and was sponsored by the book sales club "Club Bertelsmann".
Since 2003 the puppet theatre has toured through German paediatric clinics, performing "The little kangaroo and the scaredy-hare" in hopes of encouraging sick children. From April 29 to May 7, 2006 the play was also performed three times a day by the Puppenkiste in Augsburg's twin city Amagasaki in Japan.
In 2006 another tour was launched that was aimed specifically at kindergartens. By watching Peter Schneerbaum's play "Paula and the elfs from the box" children are supposed to learn how to deal with their emotions.
In the context of project "Papilio" of the Beta-Institute the play was created using scientific knowledge.
The Papilio tour started at the Bayerischer Landtag in Munich March 7, 2006.
Relocation of the stage / Puppentheater museum.
As part of the renovation of the Heilig-Geist-Spital, the whole stage was moved to a different part of the house (from the left to the right, seen from the entrance).
Since 6 October 2001, the Puppenkiste has a museum, located on the first floor of the Heilig-Geist-Spital building, directly above the theater halls. This had been a long-time dream of Hannelore Marschall-Oehmichen. The most famous marionettes like "Urmel", "Jim Knopf" and Kalle Wirsch can be seen in a permanent exhibition. Special exhibitions often dedicated to specific topics show other puppets from the house's own collection as well as from other theaters. These temporary exhibitions change every four months.
Music.
With a dance remix of the song "Eine Insel mit zwei Bergen" (EN: An island with two mountains) from the soundtrack of the film version of "Jim Knopf und Lukas der Lokomotivführer", the band Dolls United reached nationwide success in the music charts in German-speaking countries. In 1996, the single received the German platinum record award for more than 500,000 copies sold.
Selected children's books.
Many characters and stories of the Augsburger Puppenkiste have been featured in children's books:

Jelena Šubić

Jelena Šubić (died 1378) was a member of the Bribir branch of the Croatian Šubić noble family who ruled the Banate of Bosnia as regent from 1354 until 1357 during the minority of her son Tvrtko I of Bosnia.
Life.
Jelena was the daughter of the Croatian lord George II Šubić of Bribir, Count of Klis. She married Vladislav, brother of Ban Stephen II of Bosnia, in Klis Fortress in late 1337 or early 1338. Lampridio Vitturi, Bishop of Trogir, celebrated the marriage; Trogir authorities hostile to him later complained to the papacy that the marriage was uncanonical due to the couple having been descended from the same ancestor. Jelena and Vladislav had two sons, Tvrtko and Vuk.
Regency.
Tvrtko was about 15 years old when he became Ban of Bosnia upon the death of Jelena's brother-in-law in the fall of 1353. Jelena and Vladislav, who was excluded from succession for unknown reasons, assumed government in the name of the young Ban. Widowed within a year, Jelena continued ruling on Tvrtko's behalf alone. Accompanied by her younger son, Jelena immediately traveled to the court of their overlord, King Louis I of Hungary, to seek his consent to Tvrtko's accession. Louis tasked her with delivering a message to her sister-in-law Jelena Nemanjić, widow of her brother Mladen III, who was trying to keep hold of the Kliss Fortress. Upon her return to Bosnia, Jelena presided over an assembly ("stanak") in Mile and confirmed the possessions and privileges of the noblemen of "all of Bosnia, Donji Kraji, Zagorje and the Hum land". In May 1355 she decided to take an active part in the dispute over the Šubić family inheritance, which had been ongoing since the death of her brother Mladen in 1348. Jelena marched with Tvrtko and their army to Duvno. An agreement was concluded by which her son was to inherit all cities held by her father and a city held by her sister Katarina.
Jelena's regency ended in 1357. She and her sons were granted citizenship by the Republic of Venice in 1364. Two years later she accompanied Tvrtko to the Hungarian royal court following his brief deposition in favor of Vuk; Tvrtko reinstated himself within a year. In the fall of 1374, Jelena organized and attended the wedding of her son and Dorothea of Bulgaria.

Mukteshvara Temple, Bhubaneswar

Mukteshwara Temple (; also spelt Mukteswara) is a 10th-century Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva located in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. The temple dates back to 950–975 CE and is a monument of importance in the study of the development of Hindu temples in Odisha. The stylistic development of the Mukteswara Temple marks the culmination of all earlier developments, and initiates a period of experiment which continues for an entire century, as seen in such temples as the Rajarani Temple and Lingaraj temple, both located in Bhubaneswar. It is one of the prominent tourist attractions of the city.
History.
The Mukteshvara Temple is found to be the earliest work from the Somavamshi period. Most scholars believe that the temple is the successor to Parashurameshvara Temple and was built earlier to the Brahmeswara Temple (1060 CE). Percy Brown puts the date of construction of the temple to 950 CE. The presence of a "torana", which is not part of any other temple in the region, makes this temple unique and some of the representations indicate the builders were starters of a new culture. K.C. Panigrahi places the temple to be built during 966 CE and postulates that the Somavamshi king Yayati I built the temple. He also associates the legend of Kirtivassa to this temple, but the postulation is not accepted as Kirtivasa is associated with Lingaraja, though both were built at the same time for the same deity, Shiva. There is no historic evidence to conclude that Yayati had built the temple.
Architecture.
This architecture is one of the basic reasons why Mukteshvara Temple is also known as the "Gem of Odisha architecture" or "Kalinga Architecture" . The temple faces west and is constructed in a lower basement amidst a group of temples. The pyramidal roof to the "jagamohana" present in the temple was the first of its kind over the conventional two tier structure. The temple is a small one compared to other larger temples in Bhubaneswar. The temples is enclosed within an octagonal compound wall with elaborate carvings on it. It is believed that the experiment of newer pattern in the temple showed a mature phase compared to its predecessors and culminated the beginning of replication of similar pattern in the later temples in the city. The temple has a porch, called "torana", which acts as the gateway to the octagonal compound. The temple has two structures namely, the "vimana" (structure above the sanctum) and a "mukhasala", the leading hall, both of which are built on a raised platform. The temple is the earliest to be built in "pithadeula" type.
Porch.
The most important feature of the Mukteshvara Temple is the "torana", or the arched gateway, dating back to about 900 CE and showing the influence of Buddhist architecture. The arched gateway has thick pillars that have strings of beads and other ornaments carved on statues of smiling women in languorous repose. The porch is a walled chamber with a low, massive roof and internal pillars. The combination of vertical and horizontal lines is skillfully arranged so as to give dignity to buildings of moderate height. This early astylar form of the temple is best illustrated in this temple. The gateway has sculptures that range from elaborate scrolls to pleasant female forms and figures of monkeys and peacocks. The front and back of the arch are similar in design.
Vimana.
The "Vimana" is square in plan and is built in a raised platform with pilasters in each facade. The "shikara" is small compared to other temples; it has four Natarajas and four kirthimukhas on the four faces. The top portion of the "shikara" has the "kalasa". The "shikara" is tall, with every inch sculpted with decorative patterns, architectural patterns and sculpted figures. A new form of decoration called "bho", possibly developed here, became a prominent feature in later Odishan temples. It is a highly ornate chaitya window crowned by masked demon head and dwarf figures.
Sanctum.
The sanctum is sculpted with beautiful damsels exhibiting feminine charms entwined with "nagas" and "naginis". The sanctum is cubical from the inside with offset walls on the outside.
Jagamohana.
This distinctive 10th-century temple is one of the smallest and compact temples. The "jagamohana" is tall. It is decorated with intricate carvings by the Vishwakarma Moharana sculptors. The temple is regarded as a gem of Nagara architecture of Kalinga architecture. Except for the rectangular plan of its "jagamohana", it is the earliest example of what may be termed proper Odisha temple type; a "vimana" with a curvelinear spire and a "jaganmohana" with a stepped pyramidal roof.
The temple's red sandstone is covered with exquisite carvings of lean "sadhus" or holy men and voluptuous women encrusted with jewels. The images of Ganga and Yamuna are carved next to Chanda and Prachanda. The "torana" is present in front of the "jagamohana". The figure of Lakulisa, seated in "bhumispara-mudra" and holding a "lakuta" is present on the lintel of the "jagamohana". The figures of Gajalakshmi, Rahu and Ketu are also sculpted in the structure. A small extension from the side roof of the "jagamohana" has the image of a lion sitting on its hind legs. The exterior walls of the structure are decorated with pilasters with "nagas" and "naginis".
Others.
The doorway to the inner sanctum houses the image of Ketu with three hooded snakes, commonly regarded as the ninth planet in the Hindu mythology.
There is a tank in the eastern side of the temple and a well in the south-western corner. A dip in the first known as the "Marichi Kunda" is believed to cure infertility in women. There are other shrines within the temple complex with "lingam" inside, which were used as offering shrines. The doorway of the temple is ornate. The temple is enclosed by a low compound wall that follows the contours of the temple. The temple has sculptures both inside and outside the structure. The compound walls leaves a very small passage separating the shrine.
Religious significance.
Mukteshvara means "Lord of Freedom" (from the cycle of births and deaths). The temple is dedicated to Hindu God Shiva. There are a number of sculptures of skeletal ascetics in teaching or meditation poses. Some scholars correlate the role of the temple as a centre for Tantric initiation with the name Mukteshvara as a possible thesis. The outer face of the compound wall has niches of Hindu deities like Saraswathi, Ganesha and Lakulisha (the fifth century founder of the Pashupata sect of tantric Shaivism). The numerous images of Lakulisha are found in miniature forms within Chaitya arches, showing various mudras like yoga, Bhumispara and vyakyana with yogapatta tied to their knees. They are accompanied by the images of the disciples. According to tradition, barren women give birth to sons if they take a dip in the "Marichi Kunda" tank in the premises of the temple on the night before Ashokashtami car festival. On the evening, the water in the tank is sold to the public.
In popular culture.
The Department of Tourism of the state government organises a three-day yearly dance function called "Mukteswar Dance Festival" in the temple premises. This festival celebrates the features of Odissi, the classical dance form of Odisha and Odissi music, the classical music of the same tradition. Popular Odissi dancers perform during the function, accompanied by musical instruments like mardala. The event is webcast in the state government portal.

Same-sex marriage in Uruguay

Same-sex marriage has been legal in Uruguay since August 5, 2013. A bill for legalization was passed by the Chamber of Representatives on December 12, 2012, in a vote of 81–6. The Senate approved it with some minor amendments on April 2, 2013, in a 23–8 vote. The amended bill was approved 71–21 by the Chamber of Representatives on April 10, and was signed into law by President José Mujica on May 3, 2013. It took effect on August 5. Uruguay was the third country in South America, after Argentina and Brazil, and the fourteenth in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.
On January 20, 2008, Uruguay became the first Latin American country to enact a national civil union law. Civil unions provide same-sex couples with several, but not all, of the rights and benefits of marriage.
Civil unions.
On January 20, 2008, Uruguay became the first Latin American country to enact a national civil union law, titled . The law, proposed by Senator Margarita Percovich of the Broad Front, was passed in the Chamber of Representatives on November 29, 2007, after having been passed in a similar form in the Senate in 2006. The bill was passed by both chambers in the same form on December 19, and signed into law by President Tabaré Vázquez on December 27. It was published in the official journal on January 10, 2008, and came into effect on January 20. The first union was performed on April 17, 2008.
Following the approval of the bill, both same-sex and opposite-sex couples are allowed to enter into a civil union (, ) after having lived together for at least five years, and are entitled to most of the benefits afforded to married couples, including social security entitlements, inheritance rights and joint ownership of goods and property.
A government-backed bill allowing same-sex couples to adopt children was discussed in Parliament in the spring of 2008, receiving the support of President Vázquez and fierce opposition from the Catholic Church. The bill was approved 40–13 by the Chamber of Representatives on August 27, 2009, and by the Senate on September 9 with a 17–6 vote. It was signed into law by Vázquez on September 18, 2009, making Uruguay the first country in South America to allow same-sex couples to jointly adopt.
Same-sex marriage.
Legislative action.
On May 25, 2009, Senator Margarita Percovich announced that if the Broad Front won the national elections in October 2009 it would introduce a same-sex marriage bill to the General Assembly. In October, the Broad Front won an absolute majority in both chambers of the General Assembly and José Mujica, the Broad Front presidential candidate, won the presidential election on November 29, 2009. In July 2010, Brond Front legislators announced plans to submit a bill to legalise same-sex marriage. Michelle Suárez Bértora, the first transgender attorney in Uruguay, assisted in drafting the same-sex marriage legislation as part of her work with the LGBT rights organization ("Black Sheep"). On July 25, 2010, former President Julio María Sanguinetti of the Colorado Party expressed his support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, while former President Luis Alberto Lacalle of the National Party stated his opposition. In April 2011, Sebastián Sabini, a legislator of the Movement of Popular Participation, one of the parties consisting the Broad Front, presented the bill allowing same-sex couples to marry. The bill was formally submitted to the Chamber of Representatives on September 6, 2011.
In June 2012, a court recognized a same-sex marriage conducted in Spain, ruling that local laws permitted same-sex marriage and that same-sex couples who had married abroad could have their marriage recognized under Uruguayan law by a judge. However, the ruling was appealed.
In June 2012, Minister of Education and Culture Ricardo Ehrlich announced that the same-sex marriage bill would be debated in the Parliament before the end of 2012. On July 4, the Chamber of Representatives' Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee began debating the legislation. The committee preliminarily approved the bill on November 28, and amended it and gave final approval on December 5. On December 12, the Chamber of Representatives approved the bill by a vote of 81–6 with no abstentions, and submitted it to the Senate. The Senate's Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee passed the bill with minor amendments on March 19, 2013. The Senate approved the amended bill 23–8 on April 2. On April 10, the Chamber of Representatives approved the amended version in a 71–21 vote. It was signed into law by President José Mujica on May 3, and took effect on August 5, 2013.
Uruguay was the third country in South America, after Argentina and Brazil, and the fourteenth in the world to legalize same-sex marriage. The first same-sex marriage took place on August 5, 2013. The wedding was officiated "in extremis" at a hospital in Montevideo. The law amended article 83 of the Civil Code to state:
Presidential candidate Luis Lacalle Pou stated in an interview with "El País" in October 2018 that despite having voted against the same-sex marriage law as a national representative, should he be elected president his government would not overturn the same-sex marriage law. Lacalle Pou was elected president in the 2019 general election. In 2024, he attended a same-sex wedding in Maldonado as a guest.

In the first year after the same-sex marriage law came into effect, 134 same-sex couples had married in Montevideo and the surrounding metropolitan area. Approximately 200 same-sex couples had married in the whole country during the same period.
In 2016, estimates from the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of the Republic showed that about 60.3% of relationships in Uruguay were married opposite-sex couples, 38.4% unmarried opposite-sex couples, 0.6% opposite-sex couples in civil unions, 0.2% married same-sex couples, 0.5% unmarried same-sex couples and 0.1% same-sex couples in civil unions. These numbers remained relatively unchanged in 2017. The estimates also showed that unemployment among same-sex partners stood at 3.4% (compared to 4.7% among heterosexual partners) and that same-sex partners were more likely to have completed tertiary education (41%, compared to 19% among heterosexual partners).
Religious performance.
The Catholic Church opposes same-sex marriage and does not allow its priests to officiate at such marriages. The Episcopal Conference of Uruguay campaigned against legalization in 2013 warning of "a weakening of family values". In December 2023, the Holy See published "Fiducia supplicans", a declaration allowing Catholic priests to bless couples who are not considered to be married according to church teaching, including the blessing of same-sex couples. Archbishop of Montevideo Daniel Sturla said he would personally not offer blessings to same-sex couples. The first blessing occurred at a church in Garzón in February 2024. The couple, Carlos Perciavalle and Jimmy Castilhos, received the blessing from Father Francisco Gordalina.
Some smaller Christian denominations authorise the blessing of same-sex unions. The Waldensian Evangelical Church of the River Plate became the first denomination in Uruguay to do so in 2006. Similarly, the Evangelical Methodist Church in Uruguay allows its clergy to bless same-sex civil marriages.
Public opinion.
A Factum poll conducted in November 2011 found that 52% of the population supported same-sex marriage, 32% were opposed, 10% were neutral and 6% had no opinion. According to a Cifra poll conducted between November 29 and December 6, 2012, 53% of Uruguayans supported same-sex marriage, 32% were opposed and 15% had no opinion. The survey also showed that support for same-sex marriage was highest among Broad Front voters (62%), and lower among voters from the Colorado Party and the National Party (both 42%). Another Cifra poll, conducted between February 22 and March 4, 2013, found that 54% of respondents supported same-sex marriage, 32% were opposed, 9% were undecided and 4% had no opinion.
According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted between November 22, 2013, and January 8, 2014, 62% of Uruguayans supported same-sex marriage, while 31% were opposed.
According to the 2014 AmericasBarometer, 71% of Uruguayans were in favour of same-sex marriage. This level of support was the second highest among the 28 American countries polled, behind only Canada. 53% of respondents "strongly" supported same-sex marriage, while 17% "strongly" opposed it; with the remaining being "somewhat" in support or in opposition or had no opinion. Additionally, support was highest among young people: 79% and 80% of 18–25-year-olds and 26–35-year-olds supported same-sex marriage, respectively. Among people over the age of 66, support was 51%. The 2017 AmericasBarometer showed that 75% of Uruguayans supported same-sex marriage, while the 2023 Latinobarómetro showed that support had increased to 78%, while 20% were opposed and 2% were undecided or had refused to answer.

Scribner House (New Albany, Indiana)

The Scribner House is a historic home located at New Albany, Floyd County, Indiana. It was built by Joel Scribner, one of the three brothers who founded New Albany. He and his brothers, Nathaniel and Abner, came from New York State and named their new town "New Albany" after the capital of their home state. It is located in downtown New Albany, on the southeast corner of State and Main Streets near the Sherman Minton Bridge. It is the oldest building in New Albany.
Joel built the house in 1813-1814 using the ash, oak, and poplar trees that were cut down when clearing the property. It is designed in a New England Federal style. In total, it is 2 stories. The first floor features two parlors and a hall. The second floor has 3 bedrooms. Both these floors have a rear porch that allowed a view of the Ohio River. The ground floor is the large kitchen with a wide fireplace used for cooking.
The house passed through the family until the final owner, Harriet Scribner, a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, sold it to the Piankeshaw Chapter of the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, who made sure to keep it as Harriet left it when she died later that year. In 1977 it was put on the National Register of Historic Places.
Twice a year open house events are held, the third Saturday in May and the first Sunday in December. The December open house includes a Victorian tea Other tours can be made by appointment. All third grade children in Floyd County also visit Scribner House during the school year.

Constantine Overton

Constantine Overton (1626/7—c. 1700?), was an English Quaker leader, trading as a grocer, in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. Imprisoned and fined for his beliefs, attendance at Quaker Meetings for Worship, refusing to pay tithes to Church of England parishes, and not taking off his hat in Court and opening his shop on 25th of the Twelfth month (i.e. Christmas Day). He is sometimes known as "Constant Overton".
His first prosecution, during the English Commonwealth of Oliver Cromwell, was by a Church of England priest who objected to the outdoor preaching of Quakers meeting outside the parish church of Cressage near Shrewsbury on 5 October 1656. He and six others who were present were ultimately brought before Bridgnorth Assizes, where they were fined for contempt of court in refusing to remove hats. They were each fined £40 and remained in prison for three months until the fines were paid. He was one of the signatories (as Constant Overton) of a printed account of the case, published in London in 1657.
After the restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660, he had further imprisonments and fines as late as the 1670s. In 1675 the Society of Friends appointed Overton as one of the representatives in Shropshire to meet to report on persecutions of their co-religionists.
Overton is known to have been alive as late as c. 1700, when, aged seventy-three, he emigrated to Pennsylvania in British North America (later part of the U.S.A.) with the help of money raised by fellow Quakers in Shropshire, and the Welsh counties of Montgomeryshire and Merionethshire.

Paleta frontón

Paleta frontón is a Peruvian sport that was born in the capital, Lima, in 1945. This sport has its roots in the "pelota vasca" brought by the Spanish settlers, and the domestic "pelota mano", called "handball" at that time due to English influence. The sport is similar to squash but is played on an open court.
A wooden, carbon fiber or glass fiber paddle and a black rubber ball are required to play paleta frontón. The paddle is made from Peruvian oak typically logged near water based townships.
The fronton court consists of a playing field with a concrete wall which is placed in front of the playing area. The concrete wall is high by wide. The court is long and wide. There are lines on the court limiting the play area and marking the reception zones, similar to tennis. The court is split into two sections horizontally with the section of the court closer to the wall called the service zone. The other section is further split vertically into two zones where players stand at the beginning of a point. The serve must bounce off the wall and land in the other zone.
The is in charge of regulating the sport. The official rules, written in the "Reglamento Oficial", are provided to each player for free. The official judge of the match is called the "Wes". The FDPPF is also in charge of organizing two national championships, the regionals and the "Campeón de Campeones" ("Champion of Champions" tournament).
Paleta frontón premiered at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima under the category of Basque pelota.

Clip point

The clip point is one of the three most common shapes for the blade of a knife (the others being the drop point and the spear point). Clip point blades have the appearance of having the forward third of the blade "clipped" off. The clip itself can be straight or concave.
Description.
Traditionally, the spine or unsharpened edge of the knife begins at the hilt and continues to a point between one third to one fourth of the blade length. The blade spine then tapers in thickness in either a straight line or a recurve to the knife's point, which may be located above, below, or in line with the central axis of the blade. The thinned false edge of the clip may be sharpened to form a true second cutting edge. If the false edge is sharpened it increases the knife's effectiveness in piercing.
History.
The clip point blade design dates back to at least Macedonian times, where examples of knapped flint clip point knives from the Eneolytic period have been unearthed at the estuary of Drim. Variants include the California clip, which uses a clip greatly extended in length, and the Turkish clip point with its extreme recurve. One of the most recognizable clip-point blades is used on the famous Bowie knife.
Characteristics.
The clip point style allows a quicker, and thus deeper, puncture upon insertion (clip point knives being thinner at the spine). The drop point has a slightly slower insertion due to its thicker spine near the tip. The drop point knife allows for more control when cutting, has a slower withdrawal time, and better negotiates "drawn out" (carving like) operations. The clip point lends itself to a quicker "stabbing" advantage with less drag during insertion and faster withdrawal. Compared to the drop point design, the clip point has a narrower and weaker tip. The clip point is also weaker than the spear point, and for this reason the latter is favored for most thrusting knives, such as the dagger.

North Carolina Highway 172

North Carolina Highway 172 (NC 172) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of North Carolina; it is entirely in Onslow County. It is also unique in that over half of this highway travels through Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune on federal grounds.
Route description.
The entire routing of NC 172 is in Onslow County split in the middle by Camp Lejeune. The route's southern terminus is at US 17 in the unincorporated community of Folkstone, located between Holly Ridge and Wilmington. The road heads east-northeast through a mix of forest land and small houses towards the community of Sneads Ferry. About from its terminus, it intersects NC 210. It then starts to bend towards the north forming the border of the Sneads Ferry census-designated place. The Lakeside Drive/Old Ferry Road intersection is the last intersection that is accessible by the public along the southern segment of NC 172. North of there, the road crosses the New River before reaching the gate to Camp Lejeune. Through Camp Lejeune, the closed road heads east then north through mostly forested lands of the base. The road reopens at its intersection with Bear Creek Road, just north of a gate. On this segment of the road, NC 172 heads north passing forestland on the west side of the road and some houses on the east. The signed highway ends at a signalized intersection with NC 24 in Starling near Hubert.
History.
April 2007: Travel through the Camp Lejeune section of the highway is restricted to vehicles with U.S. Department of Defense decals as a security measure.

Richard Strange

Richard "Kid" Strange (born in January 1951) is an English actor, writer, musician, and curator, who was the founder and front man of mid-1970s protopunk art rock band Doctors of Madness.
Music.
1975–1990s.
Richard Strange's first band Doctors of Madness, formed in 1975, releasing three albums. The band was supported by the Sex Pistols, the Jam and Joy Division. He disbanded the band in 1978, after Dave Vanian of the Damned briefly joined him on vocals. He subsequently recorded as a solo artist, releasing two albums "The Live Rise of Richard Strange" (Ze Records 1981) and "The Phenomenal Rise of Richard Strange" (Virgin Records 1981) before further releases with the Engine Room up to the early 1990s.
Strange has collaborated on recordings by International Noise Orchestra, Anni Hogan and Jolie Holland. He has produced records by Way of the West ("Don't Say That's Just for White Boys"), Tom Robinson ("Martin's Gone") and the Nightingales album "Pigs on Purpose".

Nomad (video game)

Nomad is a 1993 space trading and combat game developed by Intense! Interactive and Papyrus Design Group. It was published by GameTek for MS-DOS.
"Nomad" combines elements of alien diplomacy, trading, exploration, and combat. It has been compared to "Starflight" and "".
Plot.
The story of "Nomad" changed between its early design and its ultimate commercial release. Originally, the game was to be titled "Space Mountain", and act as a tie-in to the Disneyland roller coaster of the same name. Introductory narration was recorded for the game which described the player's character climbing aboard the model ship at Space Mountain only to discover that it is a real spacecraft. It is then launched unexpectedly into the Earth's orbit with the unwitting protagonist still aboard.
The connection with Disneyland was abandoned for the commercial release of "Nomad". The story changed to describe the protagonist as being an agent of a global intelligence organization ("O.E.S.I.") that discovered a crashed alien spacecraft in a snowy region of Earth. They repair and re-launch the craft with the protagonist as its sole crew member.
Once in orbit, the player is met by another ship whose pilot, a llama-like Arden, describes the ongoing galactic war between the Alliance and a race of mechanical beings named the Korok. The player is allowed to choose whether he will actively assist the Alliance, and to what degree. Through conversation with alien beings and exploration of star systems, the player uncovers rumors and legends about an ancient alien race (the "Losten") who were the progenitors of existing sentient species. Some of the facts uncovered by the player can be used to locate a fail-safe device that destroys the Korok's Master Control Robot and restores order to the galaxy.
Disney association.
Although the Disney connection was eliminated, several game elements remain unchanged from the original design. The in-game log is titled "Space Mountain Log", and the design of the player's ship almost exactly mirrors that of the "CMB 2000" model which was part of Disneyland's Space Mountain between its 1977 opening and 2005 remodel.
Gameplay.
All gameplay takes place with the player's ship in orbit around one of approximately 270 planets that are available to visit across the galaxy. Activities include general ship functions (engineering upgrades, repairs, navigation, and scanning), conversation with aliens, and combat. Most commands are issued through a menu system with keyboard shortcuts.
When in conversation with an alien, the player may ask questions and receive responses about any planet, item, race, or individual that they have previously encountered. Different alien races will have different information available about certain topics. The player's choice of conversation topics influences the disposition of individual aliens, and other game actions influence the friendliness or animosity between alien races.
Conversation can also lead to trade, with many of the game's items providing some value as ship upgrades, navigational data stores, or historic artifacts that carry important plot information. The player may acquire resources from the surface of planets through the use of labor-bots, which are robotic probes specialized in mining, gas harvesting, agriculture, archaeology, or spycraft. These bots – and various enhancements that increase their efficiency on the surface – are available through trade with aliens.
The ship's main functions (e.g. navigation and scanning) can be improved through the acquisition of upgraded components. For example, upgrading the engine booster will reduce travel time between star systems. Upgraded missile loaders will reduce the time required for weapons lock during a combat sequence.
An in-game posting of missions by the Alliance gives a path the player may follow to advance the plot and earn rewards in the form of tradable items.
Release.
"Nomad" operates only in Mode 13h (320x200 256-color VGA). Some preliminary support was added for a 16-color EGA compatible mode at the same resolution, but the finished game did not provide any option to use this mode. The combat engine itself is simplistic, only allowing the player freedom of movement in a 2D plane despite the game using polygon rendering in 3D space.
The performance characteristics of the game's items and equipment are stored in a series of structured data tables. These – and the game's graphics and sound data – are LZSS compressed and packed into a series of archive files.
Sound was made available through Sound Blaster and Disney Sound Source support. There is no synthesized music; the only audio produced by the game is stored as 4-bit DPCM data.
Releases.
"Nomad" was released in late 1993, with a patched bugfix release (v1.01) appearing in February of the following year. It was originally available only on 3.5" floppy disk. When a CD-ROM release was made available in 1994, it included a short pre-rendered cinematic introduction, but the game's content was unchanged from the 3.5" disk release.
Reception.
"Computer Gaming World" stated that "Nomad" "is well balanced between allowing freedom of choice and imparting a feeling of progression toward the conclusion", and approved of its interface and multiple ways of solving the game. The reviewer stated that the game "came dangerously close to" imitating "Starflight" instead of being an homage, but "comes up short" compared to "" and "Elite 2": "It simply isn't as large, doesn't pay off in as many hours of play, and doesn't have the same detailed atmosphere and scope". He recommended "Nomad" to casual gamers "who actually work for a living and game 'on the side'". "PC Player" cited the game's simplicity as a positive attribute, while "PC Joker" was critical of its outdated graphics and repetitive gameplay. Power Unlimited gave a score of 91% summarizing: "A fantastic mix between adventure, strategy, sim, action and mystery. The story only becomes clear while playing.

Hydraulic motor

A hydraulic motor is a mechanical actuator that converts hydraulic pressure and flow into torque and angular displacement (rotation). The hydraulic motor is the rotary counterpart of the hydraulic cylinder as a linear actuator. Most broadly, the category of devices called hydraulic motors has sometimes included those that run on hydropower (namely, water engines and water motors) but in today's terminology the name usually refers more specifically to motors that use hydraulic fluid as part of closed hydraulic circuits in modern hydraulic machinery.
Conceptually, a hydraulic motor should be interchangeable with a hydraulic pump because it performs the opposite function – similar to the way a DC electric motor is theoretically interchangeable with a DC electrical generator. However, many hydraulic pumps cannot be used as hydraulic motors because they cannot be backdriven. Also, a hydraulic motor is usually designed for working pressure at both sides of the motor, whereas most hydraulic pumps rely on low pressure provided from the reservoir at the input side and would leak fluid when abused as a motor.
History of hydraulic motors.
One of the first rotary hydraulic motors to be developed was that constructed by William Armstrong for his Swing Bridge over the River Tyne. Two motors were provided, for reliability. Each one was a three-cylinder single-acting oscillating engine. Armstrong developed a wide range of hydraulic motors, linear and rotary, that were used for a wide range of industrial and civil engineering tasks, particularly for docks and moving bridges.
The first simple fixed-stroke hydraulic motors had the disadvantage that they used the same volume of water whatever the load and so were wasteful at part-power. Unlike steam engines, as water is incompressible, they could not be throttled or their valve cut-off controlled. To overcome this, motors with variable stroke were developed. Adjusting the stroke, rather than controlling admission valves, now controlled the engine power and water consumption. One of the first of these was Arthur Rigg's patent engine of 1886. This used a double eccentric mechanism, as used on variable stroke power presses, to control the stroke length of a three cylinder radial engine. Later, the swashplate engine with an adjustable swashplate angle would become a popular way to make variable stroke hydraulic motors.
Hydraulic motor types.
Vane motors.
A vane motor consists of a housing with an eccentric bore, in which runs a rotor with vanes in it that slide in and out. The force differential created by the unbalanced force of the pressurized fluid on the vanes causes the rotor to spin in one direction. A critical element in vane motor design is how the vane tips are machined at the contact point between vane tip and motor housing. Several types of "lip" designs are used, and the main objective is to provide a tight seal between the inside of the motor housing and the vane, and at the same time to minimize wear and metal-to-metal contact.
Gear motors.
A gear motor (external gear) consists of two gears, the driven gear (attached to the output shaft by way of a key, etc.) and the idler gear. High pressure oil is ported into one side of the gears, where it flows around the periphery of the gears, between the gear tips and the wall housings in which it resides, to the outlet port. The gears mesh, not allowing the oil from the outlet side to flow back to the inlet side. For lubrication, the gear motor uses a small amount of oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the motor housing, which is usually connected to a line that vents the motor's case pressure to the system's reservoir. An especially positive attribute of the gear motor is that catastrophic breakdown is less common than in most other types of hydraulic motors. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the motor gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.
Gear motors can be supplied as single or double-directional based on their usage, and they are preferred in either aluminum or cast iron bodies, depending on application conditions. They offer design options that can handle radial loads. Additionally, alternative configurations include pressure relief valve, anti-cavitation valve, and speed sensor to meet specific application needs.
Gerotor motors.
The gerotor motor is in essence a rotor with "n" − 1 teeth, rotating off center in a rotor/stator with "n" teeth. Pressurized fluid is guided into the assembly using a (usually) axially placed plate-type distributor valve. Several different designs exist, such as the Geroller (internal or external rollers) and Nichols motors. Typically, the Gerotor motors are low-to-medium speed and medium-to-high torque.
Axial plunger motors.
For high quality rotating drive systems, plunger motors are generally used. Whereas the speed of hydraulic pumps range from 1200 to 1800 rpm, the machinery to be driven by the motor often requires a much lower speed. This means that when an axial plunger motor (swept volume maximum 2 litres) is used, a gearbox is usually needed. For a continuously adjustable swept volume, axial piston motors are used.
Like piston (reciprocating) type pumps, the most common design of the piston type of motor is the axial. This type of motor is the most commonly used in hydraulic systems. These motors are, like their pump counterparts, available in both variable and fixed displacement designs. Typical usable (within acceptable efficiency) rotational speeds range from below 50 rpm to above 14000 rpm. Efficiencies and minimum/maximum rotational speeds are highly dependent on the design of the rotating group, and many different types are in use.
Radial piston motors.
Radial piston motors are available in two basic types: Pistons pushing inward, and pistons pushing outward.
Pistons pushing inward.
The crankshaft type (e.g. Staffa or SAI hydraulic motors) with a single cam and the pistons pushing inwards is basically an old design but is one which has extremely high starting torque characteristics. They are available in displacements from 40 cc/rev up to about 50 litres/rev but can sometimes be limited in power output. Crankshaft type radial piston motors are capable of running at "creep" speeds and some can run seamlessly up to 1500 rpm whilst offering virtually constant output torque characteristics. This makes them still the most versatile design.
The single-cam-type radial piston motor exists in many different designs itself. Usually the difference lies in the way the fluid is distributed to the different pistons or cylinders, and also the design of the cylinders themselves. Some motors have pistons attached to the cam using rods (much like in an internal combustion engine), while others employ floating "shoes", and even spherical contact telescopic cylinders like the Parker Denison Calzoni type. Each design has its own set of pros and cons, such as freewheeling ability, high volumetric efficiency, high reliability and so on.
Pistons pushing outward.
Multi-lobe cam ring types (e.g. Black Bruin, Rexroth, Hägglunds Drives, Poclain, Rotary Power or Eaton Hydre-MAC type) have a cam ring with multiple lobes and the piston rollers push "outward" against the cam ring. This produces a very smooth output with high starting torque but they are often limited in the upper speed range. This type of motor is available in a very wide range from about 1 litre/rev to 250 litres/rev. These motors are particularly good on low speed applications and can develop very high power.
Braking.
Hydraulic motors usually have a drain connection for the internal leakage, which means that when the power unit is turned off the hydraulic motor in the drive system will move slowly if an external load is acting on it. Thus, for applications such as a crane or winch with suspended load, there is always a need for a brake or a locking device.
Uses.
Hydraulic pumps, motors, and cylinders can be combined into hydraulic drive systems. One or more hydraulic pumps, coupled to one or more hydraulic motors, constitute a hydraulic transmission.
Hydraulic motors are used for many applications now such as winches and crane drives, wheel motors for military vehicles, self-driven cranes, excavators, conveyor and feeder drives, cooling fan drives, mixer and agitator drives, roll mills, drum drives for digesters, trommels and kilns, shredders, drilling rigs, trench cutters, high-powered lawn trimmers, and plastic injection machines.
Hydraulic motors are also used in heat transfer applications.

Max Guevara

Max Guevara (X5-452) is a fictional character and the protagonist of the cyberpunk science fiction television program "Dark Angel". During both seasons of the series, Max was portrayed by Jessica Alba; Geneva Locke played the character during flashbacks to her childhood. Over one thousand actresses were considered for the part of Max before Alba was given the role. Max also appears in three canonical novels based on the series as well as an apocryphal video game adaptation. Created by James Cameron and Charles H. Eglee, Max followed a long line of strong female characters in Cameron's work, including Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley.
Max is a genetically enhanced transgenic supersoldier, created in a secret government lab known as Manticore. Along with 11 other children, Max escapes from the facility when she is 9 years old. Max attempts to live a normal life while eluding recapture by Manticore. She also searches for other escaped transgenics with the help of Logan Cale, a cyber-journalist also known as "Eyes Only". The character received mostly positive reception from critics, and Alba won several awards for her portrayal of Max. In 2004, Max was ranked at No. 17 in "TV Guide"s list of the "25 Greatest Sci-Fi Legends."
Creation and appearances.
Following his success with the film "Titanic", director James Cameron teamed up with Charles H. Eglee. The two formed a production company, Cameron/Eglee Productions, and began working on ideas for a television series, eventually deciding on the idea of "Dark Angel". Cameron said they began with the idea that Max would be a genetic construct who appeared normal but was different on a genetic level, saying "We explored what that could mean. Do her eyes look different? Were there things that manifest themselves? Were there negatives to it? We wanted her to have flaws, things that were built inlike Kryptonite." Max followed a long line of strong female characters in films directed Cameron, including Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley. Cameron believes such characters are well received all round as women respond favourably to strong female characters and male audiences "want to see girls kick ass".
More than one thousand young actresses were considered for the part of Max before Jessica Alba was chosen; Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when it had been narrowed down to 20 or 30 applicants. Cameron said he was not overly impressed with Alba's acting skill or appearance in her audition tape, though he kept coming back and watching it as there was something about her attitude that he liked, eventually deciding he needed to see her in person. Alba was hired for the role before the scripts were written. Eglee said "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." In order to train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.
Max is the lead character in both seasons of the TV series "Dark Angel", where she is portrayed primarily by Alba but also by Geneva Locke as a child in flashbacks. She appears in three original novels based on the series, two of which pick up directly where the series ended and one that serves as a prequel novel, filling in the time between Max's escape from Manticore and the beginning of the first season. Max is also the playable character in the video game adaptation, "Dark Angel", where she is voiced by Alba.
Attributes.
Max was genetically engineered and carried to term by a woman who was not permitted to meet her. She was created for a secret government supersoldier program called Manticore, then located in Gillette, Wyoming. As with almost all Manticore's soldiers, Max has a barcode on the nape of her neck, with her identifying number sequence (332960073452). She is an X5 model and is thus referred to as X5-452. Designed to be "the perfect soldier," Max is extremely strong, athletic and agile. She can see in the dark, can zoom in with her eyes to view distant objects, does not need to sleep and has a photographic memory. She also has enhanced hearing, can leap up or down from great heights with ease, can hold her breath underwater for extended periods and can dodge bullets with her super speed. Max lies, cheats and steals when she needs to and shows no remorse when doing so, though she is morally opposed to guns. Max rides a Kawasaki motorcycle and enjoys riding at high speed. When she wants to be alone she sits atop of the derelict Space Needle. Max's forms 'family' bonds with her best friend and flatmate Original Cindy, her ally Logan Cale and her fellow X5 escapees. Upon escaping from Manticore, Max chooses the last name "Guevara" for herself.
Max has a genetic flaw that causes her to have seizures, and must take tryptophan to help control them. The seizures played a subplot early in the first season though the issue was phased out without explanation as the series progressed. As a side-effect of having cat DNA, Max goes into heat twice during the first season, though as with the seizures the issue did not re-appear in the second season. In the second season it is revealed that Max has no junk DNA; every one of her DNA sequences has a specific purpose.
Storyline.
In 2009 twelve of the X5s, including 9-year-old Max, escape from Manticore into a snowy forest. Max is found and given shelter by Hannah, a sympathetic Manticore nurse. Several months later terrorists detonate an electromagnetic pulse weapon in the atmosphere over the US, destroying all electronic devices in the country and throwing it into chaos and poverty. In the prequel novel, "Dark Angel: Before the Dawn", after escaping Manticore, Max makes her way to Casper, Wyoming, where she meets Lucy Barrett, a little girl who helps Max stow away in her mother's SUV. Later, after arriving in Los Angeles, California, Lucy's mother, Joann, agrees to let Max live with them. Max and Lucy endure physical and emotional abuse from Lucy's alcoholic father, Jack. Max runs away from her foster home in 2013 and heads to Hollywood, where she joins the Chinese Clan, a group of thieves taking refuge in the remains of Grauman's Chinese Theatre. In 2019, Max leaves Los Angeles to search for one of her Manticore siblings in Seattle, Washington. While stopping in Eureka, California, Max meets "Original Cindy" McEachin when she comes to McEachin's aid in a bar fight, and the two of them travel to Seattle together. In Seattle, the duo meet Kendra Maibaum, a young woman who offers Max a place to stay after Max defends her from her boss who was sexually harassing her. McEachin and Maibaum feature as regular characters in the TV series.
The TV series begins with Max, now 19, living in a post-apocalyptic Seattle. She lives in fear of Colonel Donald Lydecker, who had been assigned by Manticore to capture Max and the other escapees. Max holds a job as a bicycle messenger for the company "Jam Pony XPress", and also operates at night as a burglar, explaining, "I steal things in order to sell them for money. It's called commerce." Max is caught by Logan Cale, a vigilante cyber journalist who uses the alias "Eyes Only", while she is attempting to burglarize him. Cale notices and recognizes Max's barcode, and offers to help her locate her Manticore brothers and sisters if she agrees to team up with him. Max initially refuses, but changes her mind after Cale is rendered a paraplegic after he attempts a mission without her assistance. Max spends season one "jugg[ling] 'Eyes Only' missions" while searching for fellow Manticore escapees. A complicated romantic interest develops between Max and Cale.
Near the end of the season, Lydecker is betrayed by his superior, Elizabeth Renfro, and subsequently defects from Manticore. He aids Max in an assault on the Manticore headquarters, though Max is badly wounded and captured. In season two Cale exposes Manticore to the world, and Renfro torches the facility in an attempt to cover up the evidence, though she is killed in the process. Max escapes the facility and frees hundreds of other super soldiers and failed Manticore experiments. Lydecker disappears under mysterious circumstances. National Security Agency agent Ames White, who is also a member of a secretive cult that wishes to eliminate transgenics, is tasked with recapturing the Manticore escapees. Both the authorities and cult members pursue Max, though she escapes to Terminal City, an abandoned part of Seattle where hundreds of outcast transgenics have been hiding. When the police begin to surround Terminal City, Max convinces the other transgenics to stand their ground rather than run. The second and final season ends with the military surrounding and possibly preparing to invade Terminal City.
The novel "Dark Angel: Skin Game" picks up where season two ends. Reports of a transgenic serial killer in Seattle are exacerbating the stand-off at Terminal City. Max uncovers that the killer's psychosis was caused by him unwillingly being given a psychoactive drug by White. A truce develops between transgenics and the authorities after Max publicly reveals the information, and White goes into hiding. The final novel, "Dark Angel: After the Dark", picks up where the previous novel ends. Cale is kidnapped by the cult, who are trying to provoke Max into attacking them. Max eventually leads an assault on the cult's headquarters, which frees Cale and results in White's death and the compound being set on fire. As the headquarters burn Max finds Lydecker in a prison cell, and he promises to help her find her mother if she saves him, to which she agrees. The book ends with Cale and Max finally consummating their relationship.
Reception.
Max has been cited as a feminist character and is considered a symbol of female empowerment. Writing for the University of Melbourne, Bronwen Auty considered Max to be the "archetypal modern feminist hero – a young woman empowered to use her body actively to achieve goals", citing Max's refusal to use firearms and instead using martial arts and knowledge as weapons as contributing to this status. Writing in "Science Fiction Film &amp; Television", Clarice Butkus noted Max has been considered a "distinctly millennial post-third-wave feminist warrior", and considered Max's relationship and dialogue with Original Cindy, an African American lesbian, to convey female empowerment. For example Cindy encourages Max not to feel guilt over her sexual behaviour and instead to embrace a traditionally masculine approach to sex. Writing in "Reconstruction: Studies in Contemporary Culture", Lorna Jowett also considered Max an example of female empowerment, saying she appeared to be the "usual postmodern, postfeminist representation of the female action hero" who displayed mixtures and reversals of traditional gender traits.
The character received mainly positive reviews from critics. In October 2000 Howard Rosenberg commented "If pouty faces and sexy walks could destroy, the highly arresting Max would be wiping out the entire planet. It's actually quite moving. And she looks great on her bike." Hal Boedeker from the "Orlando Sentinel" gave a positive review of Max, and compared her skills to those of Catwoman, Xena, Emma Peel and Wonder Woman. "Time" commented favorably on Alba's physical skills portraying Max, though stated she had "an emotional range unusual among action babes." Conversely, Joyce Millman said "Cameron and Eglee give us very little incentive to care about Max as a person, the way we care about Buffy or Faith. And that's because Max is little more than lips and ass and a premise reminiscent of other, better shows." In December 2000 "People" listed Alba's portrayal of Max as among the breakthrough performances of 2000.
Alba was nominated for several awards for her portrayal of Max. She won "Best Actress on Television" at the 27th Saturn Awards, "Breakout Star of the Year" at the "TV Guide" Awards, "Outstanding Actress in a New Television Series" at the ALMA Awards and "Choice Actress" at the 2001 Teen Choice Awards. In 2004, Max was ranked at number 17 in "TV Guide"s list of the "25 Greatest Sci-Fi Legends", and in 2012, Dave Golder from GamesRadar ranked Max at number 49 on his list of the 100 sexiest women in sci-fi.

Let's Ride (The Game song)

"Let's Ride" is a song performed by rapper The Game for his second album, "Doctor's Advocate" (2006). The song, written by The Game and Scott Storch, was released as the album's second single in the US on September 25, 2006, and in the UK on January 8, 2007. The Game mentioned on radio station KDAY in Los Angeles, California that the track was recorded in Miami, Florida, but had the feel of a West Coast Dr. Dre record. The song peaked at number 46 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. "Let's Ride" heavily references the 1993 single "Let Me Ride" by rapper Dr. Dre.
Reception.
"Let's Ride" received mediocre reviews from music critics. "MusicOMH" wrote that the track "lacks in any of the vigour and enthusiasm that came with his debut major release album". "Pitchfork" gave the song a negative review saying, "What an embarrassment this song turned out to be, lumberingly obvious and poorly crafted from the first awkward gang reference to the last Dre namedrop." About.com's Henry Adaso called the track "just another boring mantra devoid of substance" with The Game delivering "a lethargic sprawl, replete with 50 Cent-esque crooning and tautological Dre odes ("Ain't nuthin' but a G thang, baby, it's a G thang")." "Entertainment Weekly", in a review of "Doctor's Advocate", wrote that the song "recycle[s] Dre's signature high-pitched synths and plinking pianos" and is "marred by stale rhymes chronicling cartoonish gangbanging." "Chocolate" magazine said the track "lacks charisma and substance, and is filled with 50 Cent-style tuneless crooning, endless name checks for Aftermath, Eminem and Dr. Dre and empty lyrics". There is also an unofficial remix for this song featuring Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg and Xzibit.
Music video.
The music video premiered on Black Entertainment Television's 106 &amp; Park on October 23, 2006, as a "new joint". On November 14, 2006, the video debuted on MTV's "Total Request Live" at #10 and stayed on the chart for well over 16 days. The Game is seen riding in a 1964 Chevrolet Impala with hydraulics and contains a cameo appearance by fellow West Coast rapper Snoop Dogg. The video was also the subject of an MTV "Making the Video" episode like his previous single, "Dreams".

Parsurameswara Temple

Parsurameswara Temple (IAST: ') also spelt Parashurameshvara, is a Hindu temple, located in the East Indian city of Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, India, is considered the best preserved specimen of an early Odia Hindu temple dated to the Shailodbhava period between the 7th and 8th centuries CE. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva and is one of the oldest existing temples in the state. It is believed to have been built around 650 CE in Nagara style and has all the main features of the pre-10th century Kalinga Architecture style temples. The temple is one among the Parashurameshvara group of temples.
Parashurameshvara Temple has a "vimana", the sanctum, and a "bada", the curvilinear spire over its roof, rising to a height of . It is the first temple to have an additional structure called "jagamohana", compared to the earlier temples that had only the "vimana". Though the temple is dedicated to Shiva, it contains sculpted images of Shakta deities, which are otherwise normally part of Shakta temples. The temple is the first in Bhubaneswar to contain depictions of Saptamatrikas, namely, Chamunda, Varahi, Indrani, Vaishnavi, Kaumari, Shivani and Brahmi. The temple is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a ticketed monument. Parashurashtami is the major festival celebrated in the temple during June–July every year. The temple is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in the state of Odisha.
History.
Parashurameshvara Temple is one of the Parashurameshvara group of temples, considered to be the oldest temples in Bhubaneswar. Some historians believe Parashurameshvara Temple to have been built in the early 8th century CE., subsequent to the construction of the Satruguneswar, Bharateswar and Lakshmaneswar temples in the late 7th century, although K.C.Panigrahi places the date as 650 CE. Fergusson believed that the temple might have been initiated at around 500 CE. A mid-7th century date is agreed by most scholars based on style and the presence of the eight planets which appear over the door to the inner sanctum as the later temples portray nine.
Parashurameshvara Temple was built by the Shailodbhavas, who had Shiva as their family deity. The Shailodbhavas also respected the Shakta deities and depicted Shakta images on the walls of the temple. The temple was repaired in 1903, with some changes in the roof of the inner sanctum, whilst retaining most of the original structure. Being located in the eastern coast, Parashurameshvara, like other Odia temples, was not much affected by Muslim invasions of the 12–13th centuries. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a ticketed monument.
Architecture.
The Kalingan temples have two parts: the sanctum, called "vimana", and a place from where pilgrims view the sanctum, called the "jagamohana" (hall of worshippers). Parashurameshvara Temple is the first to have this additional structure. The initial "deul" temples were without the "jagamohana" as seen in some of the older temples in Bhubaneswar, while the later temples had two additional structures namely "nata-mandapa" (festival hall) and "bhoga-mandapa" (hall of offerings). The "vimana" is square in plan and the walls have sections called "rathas" or "pagas". The "vimana" has a curvilinear tower (called "bada") in the form of a pyramid composed of horizontal planes. The sanctum of the temple measures from the inside, from the outside and has a height of . Amalaka, a stone disk with ridges on the rim, is placed over the "bada" of the temple.
The "jagamohana" is rectangular in shape and has a two-element sloping roof with clerestory windows between them. The "jagamohana" measures from the inside and from the outside. The latticed windows are classified as "pata jali" where perforations are square or rectangular in shape. In addition, there are trellised windows with slabs of stone sculptures depicting dancers and musicians. Light enters the interior through doors and the latticed windows. The junction of the "vimana" and the "jagmohana" is not cleanly built, leading some scholars to postulate that the porch was added at a much later date; however, the primitive connection is attributed to the building technique. The temple was constructed by burying completed portions in inclined layers of earth up which heavy pieces of stone were dragged.
The temple is one of the earliest examples of the Nagara style of Hindu temple architecture that emphasises vertical structure, as seen in subsequent temples like Mukteshvara, Lingaraj and Rajarani in Bhubaneswar and the Sun Temple at Konark.
The temple contains the earliest representation of a six-armed Mahishamardini (Durga) image, shown inside a gavaksha frame from the chest upward with a headdress, "karna kundala" (ornament), "mala" (garland) and "kankana" (anklet). Durga is seen holding a sword in the upper left hand while in the upper right hand, she is seen pressing the face of the demon buffalo. In her left middle hand, she is seen piercing the neck of the demon with a "trishula" (trident), while in her lower left hand she holds a pointed weapon. In her right middle hand she holds "Khetaka" while in her lower right hand she holds a bow. A similar image of Durga is found in the Vaital temple, which is a famous Shakta center.
Though the temple is a Shaiva shrine, it contains the images of numerous Shakta deities as Parsvadevatas sculpted on its walls. The temple is the first among Bhubaneswar temples to contain Saptamatrika images, a group of seven goddesses. These images are located in between representations of Ganesha and Virabhadra. Except for Ganesha, all other images are depicted with their respective "vahanas" (vehicles). An eight-armed dancing Ardhanarishvara, an image of Siva-Parvati and the images of Ganga and Yamuna are also found on the wall of the temple. There are also images of Vishnu, Indra, Surya and Yama in the rectangular niches around the base of the porch. A sculpture of Kartikeya riding on his peacock vehicle is present on the southern wall. Other noteworthy carvings are those of Shiva subduing the demon-king Ravana, who is seen trying to uproot Mount Kailasa, the abode of Shiva. Shiva is sculpted as Nataraja in various "tandavas" (dance poses) in the temple. As with other Odisha temples, the interiors are not sculpted but left plain. Other carvings on the temple depict a variety of fruits, flowers, birds and animals in scenes and parts of designs. A floral motif trailing from the tail of a bird is common between this temple and the ones in Vaital Deula, while a motif of vase and flowers is common between it and the ones in Mukteshvara Temple.
There are grotesque figures of "vetalas" (ghosts) on the pilasters of "jaga mohan" and on the faces of "vimana" of the temple. The figures of "nagas" (snake-man) and their female counterparts "nagins" and other females show many graceful but chaste poses. Pilgrimage is the theme of many of the scenes on the "vimana". The other notable descriptive representation on the "vimana" is the hunting scene above the central niche on the south side, where stags are depicted running away from a hunter. On the outermost frame around the latticed window of the "jaganamohana", delightful scenes of monkeys playing all manners of pranks are depicted. The "vimana" of the temple is a "triratha" with a distant semblance of a "Pancharatha" as evident from the projecting niches flanking the central projection. The "bada" of the "vimana" abruptly starts from the "talapatna" or pavement which consists of three elements instead of the usual five and encloses a parallelepiped instead of the usual cubic sanctum.
Religious significance.
Parashurameshvara represents Shiva as the lord of Parashurama, one of the avatars of Vishnu. According to Hindu legend, the temple derives its name from the penance of Parashurama and the resultant grace of Shiva. Parashuramashtami is the major festival celebrated in the temple on the 8th day of "Ashadha" (June–July) when the festival image of Lingaraja is taken to Parashurameshvara Temple and feasted.
Parashurameshvara Temple, along with Rajarani Temple and Vaitala Deula, substantiates the existence of the Devadasi tradition during the 7th and 8th centuries CE. Devadasis were girls dedicated to worship and service of a deity or a temple for the rest of their lives and usually enjoyed a high societal status. They were usually transferred to the king's palace and subsequently performed for the general masses. The temple is considered the best preserved specimen among the various oldest temples in the city.

David Horrobin

David Frederick Horrobin (6 October 1939 – 1 April 2003) was a British-Canadian entrepreneur, medical researcher, author and editor. He is best known as the founder of the biotechnology company Scotia Holdings and as a promoter of evening primrose oil as a medical treatment, Horrobin was founder and editor of the journals "Medical Hypotheses" and "Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids", the latter journal (initially titled "Prostaglandins and Medicine") co-founded with his then graduate student Morris Karmazyn.
Horrobin believed that many diseases involve a lack of fatty acid precursors and might be alleviated by supplementing with the appropriate fatty acid. Horrobin's efforts focused on evening primrose oil, which contains gamma-linolenic acid. In the 1980s, Horrobin sold primrose oil in the United States without legally demonstrating its safety and efficacy, leading to government confiscations and felony indictments of his associates. Horrobin was later accused of withholding research data and suppressing the reports of scientists who questioned his claims. During Horrobin's tenure as chief executive, Scotia Pharmaceuticals obtained licences for several drugs based on evening primrose oil, but these licenses were withdrawn for lack of efficacy. Amidst charges of mismanagement and research fraud, Horrobin was ousted as CEO by a unanimous vote of the board and left the company in 1998. In 2001, Scotia, one of the first publicly traded biotechnology companies in the United Kingdom, also became the first to collapse. After Horrobin's departure from Scotia, he founded Laxdale Ltd., a company that investigated omega-3 fatty acids as possible treatments for schizophrenia and neurodegenerative diseases.
Horrobin died of pneumonia as a complication of mantle cell lymphoma in 2003. Obituaries noted his contributions to the biotechnology industry, intellectual acumen, original thinking and adventurousness, while some criticised his promotion of primrose oil and other questionable claims. Notably controversial obituaries in "The Independent" and the "British Medical Journal" angered Horrobin's friends and family by also portraying negative aspects of Horrobin's life, with the "BMJ" obituary stating that Horrobin "may prove to be the greatest snake oil salesman of his age".
Education and academic career.
Born in Bolton, England, Horrobin attended Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Blackburn, and King's College in Wimbledon. He studied medicine on scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, obtaining degrees in both medicine and surgery, and during the same period earned a doctorate in neurophysiology and neuroendocrinology. On completing his pre-clinical work, Horrobin became a fellow of Magdalen College in 1963. At Magdalen, he was strongly influenced by the nutritionist Hugh Macdonald Sinclair and his hypotheses on essential fatty acids and degenerative disease.
Following participation in the Flying Doctor Service in east Africa, Horrobin was appointed as professor and chairman of medical physiology at Nairobi University in Kenya. In 1972, he moved to the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, where he was appointed as a reader in medical physiology. In 1975, he became professor of medicine at the University of Montreal.
Drug companies and dietary supplements.
Founding of Efamol and Scotia.
While working as an academic investigator, in Africa and later, Horrobin developed a theory implicating altered fatty acid metabolism in schizophrenia. The idea did not generate interest, and Horrobin failed to obtain funding. It was noted that Horrobin presented only circumstantial evidence and was unable to propose a mechanism underlying the hypothesised link. To raise money for his research, Horrobin left academia and in 1977 established a company called Efamol to sell evening primrose oil (EPO) as a proposed treatment for various ailments. For example, Horrobin considered EPO to be a treatment for eczema "after trying it on the son of a librarian from his college". Horrobin planned to use the profits from Efamol to fund research and development of drugs containing EPO fatty acids. Efamol, renamed Scotia Pharmaceuticals in 1987, was active in Nova Scotia, Surrey and Scotland. In 1993, under Horrobin's leadership, Scotia was one of the first biotechnology companies to be floated on the London Stock Exchange. Scotia spent heavily on research, being ranked 79th among all UK companies in 1993, and reached a peak market capitalisation of about £600m in 1996. As a major shareholder of Scotia, Horrobin rose to number 212 in 1996 on the list of the wealthiest people in the United Kingdom.
Controversy and administration.
Legal and regulatory problems.
Horrobin, within several years of founding Efamol, was selling EPO in more than 25 countries. He marketed the supplement as a treatment for "PMS, alcoholism, pregnancy-induced hypertension, atopic eczema, elevated cholesterol levels, hypertension, scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, mastalgia (breast pain) and other problems", but according to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Horrobin did not satisfactorily demonstrate the efficacy and safety of his supplement. The FDA advised Efamol not to ship EPO to the United States without obtaining approval. Horrobin agreed, but began making shipments. Horrobin conspired with General Nutrition, Inc. to process Efamol into capsules in California; it would then be sold to General Nutrition and relabeled for resale under a different brand name. According to an FDA investigation, Horrobin suggested marketing strategies to circumvent the laws, including coaching retail representatives on making oral claims to customers, "planting articles on their research in the media, deploying researchers to make claims on their behalf, using radio phone-ins" and other tactics. Horrobin wrote to General Nutrition, "Obviously you could not advertise Efamol for these purposes but equally obviously there are ways of getting the information across". As a result, the FDA began to seize shipments of EPO and handed down felony indictments to General Nutrition, several executives and store managers for "conspiring to defraud the FDA and violating provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act". General Nutrition and its president entered guilty pleas and paid fines, but Horrobin was not prosecuted.
Efamol continued to ship EPO into the United States and to market its products. In a 1989 article on "health food frauds", the New York Times reported on the FDA's seizure of "more than $1 million worth" of illegal EPO. The FDA again accused Efamol of marketing the oil "with unsubstantiated claims of treating a wide variety of illnesses". Efamol's lawyers responded that the product was not dangerous and that it had not made unsubstantiated claims. The American Dietetic Association, representing over 50,000 nutritionists, questioned the value of Horrobin's product since "one-tenth of a teaspoon of ordinary corn oil has as much of the fatty acids as a capsule of Evening Primrose Oil, at a fraction of the cost". In 1989, the FDA commissioned a report by investigator Stephen Barrett, a medical doctor and consumer protection advocate. Barrett advised the FDA that Horrobin's marketing of Efamol was done in "a transparent attempt to evade the food and drug laws". In a report on the incident published by the consumer information organisation Quackwatch, Barrett also questions Horrobin's research ethics: "Would someone that contemptuous of the law have any qualms about faking data?"
Allegations of selective reporting and research suppression.
In 2006, a column in "The Guardian" suggested that Horrobin had also actively suppressed research findings contradicting his claims about EPO. Horrobin wrote a meta-analysis of EPO research on eczema in 1989, concluding that EPO was effective. Horrobin excluded the negative results of the largest published study to date but included purported results of seven of his own unpublished studies that remained unpublished as of 2006. When several scientists asked to see the unpublished data, Horrobin's legal team convinced the journal to refuse the request. In 1997, Horrobin's team successfully halted the publication of another meta-analysis commissioned by the Department of Health. Research published after Horrobin's death indicates that fatty acids are no more effective than a placebo against eczema; Scotia's medicines licences for evening primrose oil drugs was withdrawn.
Investor concerns about an "ailing company".
As the supplement sales generated revenue, Horrobin's company began work on numerous drugs, most of them containing evening primrose oil. In 1993, the company was floated and enjoyed several years of increasing capitalisation as Horrobin reassured investors who worried about the company's lack of success, operating losses and enigmatic nature. Horrobin stated that any of four products in Scotia's drugs pipeline could bring the company billions of pounds in revenue. In early 1995, Horrobin said that he hoped to receive approval in the "next 18 months to sell one or both" of two of these drugs. In late 1996, Horrobin predicted that he would receive approval for one of the drugs "in under two years". In 1997, Horrobin stated, "Scotia will be cash-positive by 2000".
However, the initial successes of Scotia on the stock markets and Horrobin's reassurances were undermined by what investors perceived as long-standing and systemic problems at the company, and they saw their fears confirmed with the rejection in March 1997 of regulatory approval for Scotia's drug Tarabetic. Also known as Efamol, the product contained evening primrose oil and was intended to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Scotia immediately lost one quarter of its value. Licences for several evening primrose oil-containing drugs were later withdrawn. A Scotia product, Epogam, was reportedly the first drug to have its licence withdrawn as a result of "evidence that it didn't work".
By the end of 1997, Scotia was nearly broke and did not have enough money to fund another year of research. Investors worried that Horrobin had spread the company and its resources too thinly, a state described by "The Guardian" as "woolly, sprawling and lacking in focus". They also questioned Horrobin's judgement in promoting his wife to research manager of the company despite her lack of scientific or business training; her highest qualification was a BA in English and women's studies. Investors were restive about Horrobin's emphasis on products related to evening primrose oil, which they considered a "hippy" project, "outmoded and of questionable scientific validity". When it was found that borage contained a higher percentage of gamma-linolenic acid than did the evening primrose, rival companies had begun to take market share of the supplement. In 1996, "The Independent" described Scotia's supplement business as "struggling". Horrobin responded to the borage competition by accusing his rivals of "duping women, selling pigs in pokes and marketing 'unstable and potentially toxic products'."
Findings of fraud associated with Scotia trials also weighed on Horrobin's company. Goran Jamal, a doctor who had participated in developing Efamol, was found guilty of research fraud by the General Medical Council in 2003. The Council ruled that Jamal had committed "serious professional misconduct for falsifying his results", manipulating the supposed randomisation of the clinical trial conducted over a decade earlier. Scotia was faulted by industry observers for what was called a "highly unusual" compensation scheme, as it had offered the doctor a portion of profits from future sales, although the Council suggested that Jamal was prompted to commit fraud by his "belief" in the efficacy of the drug and not by his desire for financial gain.
Horrobin's ousting from Scotia.
Horrobin was ousted as chief executive of Scotia by a unanimous vote of the board and was replaced on 1 January 1998 by Robert Dow, whom Horrobin had hired several months earlier to help with the company's business plan and investor relations. Horrobin remained until May 1998 as a non-executive director. When he tried to stage a "boardroom coup" to return himself to the executive position, the other directors refused to support him, and Horrobin resigned. As the company's value fell from about £600 m to £16 m, Horrobin and his successor each blamed the other for the company's failure. Scotia went into administration in 2001.
Laxdale Ltd.
Following his departure from Scotia, Horrobin set up a new company, Laxdale Ltd, to examine the use of omega-3 essential fatty acids in treating schizophrenia and neurodegenerative diseases. The company was sold after his death to the Amarin Corporation and is now known as Amarin Neuroscience Ltd.
Research, publications and editorships.
Horrobin was a prolific writer of academic and popular works. He was also the founder/co-founder and editor of two journals, and, with his brother Peter, the co-founder of MTP Press. Peter Horrobin later founded a religious cult, Ellel Ministries.
Scientific publications.
Horrobin was an author on over 800 publications, including about 500 scientific papers, many of which appeared in journals he edited. Horrobin's belief in a connection between fatty acids and schizophrenia guided much of his career. From 1970, Horrobin was medical adviser to the Schizophrenia Society of Great Britain. He later served as the Society's president. Horrobin also wrote on other scientific issues. He considered research with animal models of human disease to be a waste of resources, and believed that large-scale clinical trials were unnecessary and unethical. However, in at least one case, he defended modern medicine by writing a critique of Ivan Illich's famous attack on the medical establishment, "Medical Nemesis".
Journal editor.
Horrobin was a longtime critic of the anonymous peer review system, which, he believed, stifled creativity and innovation in science. Horrobin founded and edited the non-peer reviewed journal "Medical Hypotheses" to provide an outlet for unorthodox ideas and research that would not be evaluated by other scientists before publication. Horrobin envisioned the journal as a resort for thinkers who were "very good at generating ideas, but are complete klutzes in the field" and committed to publishing ideas based only on whether he or other reviewers considered them "interesting and reasonable".
Horrobin also co-founded the journal "Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids". Science writer Susan Allport, in her book on dietary fatty acids, states that Horrobin founded this journal to disseminate his ideas about evening primrose oil and fatty acids.
Popular science.
In the popular science book "The Madness of Adam and Eve" (2001), Horrobin outlined his hypothesis that schizophrenia contributed to the evolution of modern humans. According to Horrobin, fat metabolism was altered as humans evolved from other primates, leading to early humans with schizophrenia. These humans were more creative and did not experience as much physical pain as others. Horrobin suggested that the "genes for schizophrenia are responsible for most of the religious sense, most of the technical and artistic creativity and most of the leadership qualities of modern human beings". "The Madness of Adam and Eve" was one of six books shortlisted for the 2002 Aventis Prize (now the Royal Society Prizes for Science Books; the prize was won that year by Stephen Hawking's "The Universe in a Nutshell"). Reviews of the book were mixed, writing of a "useful contribution" that was also "highly partisan and selective"; an "engaging and plausible argument" that is "not so convincingly" argued; and a book "brightly written" but with "a huge hole in its central premise" Horrobin was somewhat critical of his theory, describing it as a "just-so story perhaps fed by my own personal delusions". The book was compared unfavorably to similar works by Kay Redfield Jamison, who examines a possible link between bipolar disorder and artistic creativity.
Tim Crow, a professor of psychiatry at Oxford University who had proposed a similar theory in 1995, accused Horrobin of failing to acknowledge Crow's contributions to the development of his ideas. When novelist Sebastian Faulks stated that Horrobin's ideas influenced his novel "Human Traces", published in 2005, Crow protested that "much of the credit for his theory has been misdirected by Faulks to the late maverick doctor and writer, David Horrobin".
Death and obituary controversy.
In 2001, Horrobin was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma. He died of pneumonia as a complication of this cancer in 2003. Horrobin was survived by his wife, Sherri Clarkson, and two children from a previous marriage. A number of obituaries were published, both in medical journals such as "The Lancet" and Horrobin's "Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids", and in the popular press. Most obituaries referred to Horrobin as a highly intelligent, creative and persuasive individual. According to "The Telegraph", Horrobin was "a founding father of the biotechnology industry and regarded by some as one of Britain's finest original thinkers in medicine", but the same obituary also noted that Horrobin's implication of fatty acid metabolism in schizophrenia was not accepted by other scientists; that his approach was "unorthodox" and unpopular; and that his major business venture failed. The many problems at Scotia under Horrobin's leadership, which led to the company's eventual collapse, were a theme in several obituaries including two highly critical and controversial accounts written by former Horrobin colleague Caroline Richmond and published in the "British Medical Journal" (BMJ)" and The Independent".
The BMJ obituary sparked a months-long controversy. The obituary described Horrobin as "effortlessly prolific" and "one of the most persuasive people on earth", but also criticised him as excessively promoting evening primrose oil despite a lack of scientific evidence, noting that some critics questioned his ethics. It suggested that Horrobin "may prove to be the greatest snake oil salesman of his age", stating that his evening primrose oil would "go down in history as the remedy for which there is no disease" and reporting that several of Scotia's product licences were later withdrawn because the drugs were ineffective. The obituary generated the largest e-mail response to an obituary in the history of the "BMJ". Respondents, including Horrobin's colleagues, friends and family, were largely critical of the negative tone of the obituary. On behalf of Horrobin's family, Horrobin's son-in-law, Adam Kelliher, filed a complaint with the British Press Complaints Commission, alleging that the BMJ obituary was "inaccurate" and "intrusive at a time of grief" in violation of the Code of Practice. Kelliher was founder and at the time chief executive of Equazen, a company marketing fish and evening primrose oils including a formulation called eye q, said to improve scholastic ability in children. However, in his initial complaint to the BMJ Kelliher stated that he had no competing interests. In reaction, the "BMJ" published an apology to Horrobin's family expressing regret for any distress caused. The journal corrected what its editor considered several insignificant spelling and factual errors and published three further obituaries of Horrobin. However, the journal also defended its original obituary as fairly presenting "both the positive and negative aspects of its subject's life". Kelliher did not accept the BMJ apology as genuine and maintained that inaccuracies and "unjustified slander" remained, but the Press Complaints Commission declined to take any action against the journal, stating that the BMJ had offered "sufficient remedial action". According to the commission, the journal was not obliged to omit negative information, including the journal's contention "that Dr Horrobin was 'in some ways a charlatan'".
Posthumous honours.
In June 2004, the scientific publisher Elsevier, having acquired the journal "Medical Hypotheses", created an annual David Horrobin Prize for medical theory in his honour. He was posthumously awarded the Stephen S. Chang Award by the American Oil Chemists' Society in 2003.

Median arcuate ligament

The median arcuate ligament is a ligament under the diaphragm that connects the right and left crura of diaphragm.
Structure.
The median arcuate ligament is formed by the right and left crura of the diaphragm. The crura connect to form an arch, behind which is the aortic hiatus, through which pass the aorta, the azygos vein, and the thoracic duct.
Variation.
In between 10% and 24% of people, the median arcuate ligament occurs very low.
Clinical significance.
Compression of celiac artery and celiac ganglia by the median arcuate ligament being too low in some individuals; this can lead to the median arcuate ligament syndrome, which is characterized by abdominal pain, weight loss, and an epigastric bruit.

He came to Louisbourg, Cape Breton Island, in 1757. He was the surgeon-major to the troops there and they left that year for Quebec City in New France. Badelard was taken prisoner at the battle of the Plains of Abraham. 
Badelard stayed in Canada under the British régime and was surgeon to the Canadian militia. There he eventually found himself in another conflict. The conflict was the defense of Quebec against the Americans and Richard Montgomery in 1775. 
In 1776, Badelard became the surgeon to the Quebec garrison but his contribution to Canadian history came through his research of the Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec malady which was correctly identified as a venereal disease. As a result of his studies of the illness, he wrote one of the first medical articles published in Canada.
Badelard was active and successful in civilian practice as well and served on the Quebec Medical Board for a time. He was considered to be a highly qualified medical man but a person who was hard to get along with, as reports of the time indicate. Louis-Joseph de Montcalm was the most famous Canadian to complain of this characteristic.

Octave Meynier

Octave Meynier was a French military officer, born on 22 February 1874 at Saint-Yrieix-la-Perche in France and died on 31 May 1961 at Algiers. He is remembered as one of two officers who took control of the Voulet–Chanoine Mission, which mutinied and rampaged through West Africa in 1899. He fought in the First World War and later launched a number of cross-Saharan motorised expeditions.
Early life and family.
Octave Meynier's father was the Marine officer . (Octave's brother Albert was the father of geographer André Meynier.)
French Sudan.
Meynier graduated from the military academy of Saint-Cyr in 1895, and was immediately assigned to the French Sudan.
Four years later, in 1899, he was Lt-Col. Jean-François Klobb's adjutant in Klobb's mission to reach the Voulet–Chanoine Mission and replace the expedition's commanders, Paul Voulet and Julien Chanoine. Voulet refused to cede command to Klobb, and on 14 July killed Klobb and wounded Meynier. Only a few days later a mutiny among the troops resulted in Voulet's and Chanoine's deaths, and Meynier joined Paul Joalland in command of the expedition. Under Meynier and Joalland the expedition completed its main goal, the union of French West African possessions. Meynier was later to write of the Voulet affair in "A la recherche de Voulet".
In 1913 Meynier was made military commander of the territory of the oasis of Ouargla, and in 1914 proposed to modernize Africa through the construction of roads.
World War I.
During the battle of Verdun, he assumed command of the 1st Regiment of Algerian Tirailleurs, and was wounded on 5 April 1918 by a shell that took away his left arm.
Algeria.
After the war he returned to Africa as head of the military staff of the governor-general of Algeria, Maurice Viollette; from 1926 to 1934 he held the position of Director of the Territories (Saharan Algeria), and was given the opportunity to realize the web of routes covering the Sahara he had first thought of in 1914.
African auto rallies.
In 1930 he organised the Mediterranean–Niger car rally, using the roads he had just built.
He left the army in 1935, with the rank of Brigadier General.
Meynier, who saw in rallying an immediate way to improve relations between the Mediterranean and African peoples, organised in 1950 the first Trans-African car rally, the Algiers-Cape Town Rally.

Branisko Tunnel

The Branisko Tunnel is a road tunnel in eastern Slovakia. It is located on the D1 motorway at Beharovce - Fričovce section. It replaced the Branisko Pass road via mountain range of the same name, with the top at 751 m AMSL. Currently only one tube is open to traffic; the second tube is expected to be opened in the future.
Construction began when the exploration gallery driving was launched in April 1996 on the axle of the northern (left) tube. The southern tube driving started in May 1997 from both portals using New Austrian Tunnelling method (NATM). Works were slowed in 1999 due to cost cutting for motorway constructions. The breakthrough was made on May 1, 1999. The southern (right) tube of the tunnel with the Beharovce - Fričovce section was opened on June 29, 2003. 
The tunnel is 4975 m long. The road in the tunnel is 7.5 m wide, with 1 m wide sidewalks on both sides; maximum height is 4.5 m, maximum gradient is 1.2%. The maximum allowed speed in tunnel is 80 km/h.

St. Pius X High School shooting

The St. Pius X High School shooting occurred on October 27, 1975, at St. Pius X High School in Ottawa, Ontario. It was Canada's second recorded school shooting. The gunman, Robert Poulin, an 18-year-old St. Pius student, opened fire on his classmates with a shotgun, killing a 17-year-old classmate named Mark Hough and wounding five others before killing himself with a shotgun blast to the head. Earlier that day, Poulin lured a 17-year-old Sri Lankan female neighbour named Kim Rabot to his family's home before raping her and stabbing her to death. That afternoon, he had traveled to the St. Pius X High School to embark upon his shooting spree.
Poulin was from a military family and held military aspirations of his own, repeatedly telling his parents of his desire to become a pilot within the Royal Canadian Air Force. These were largely thwarted by his physical condition and psychological immaturity, resulting in his being rejected from the officer training program. His physical problems included poor eyesight and a chest deformity.
Poulin had been suicidal for at least three years prior to the attack and was obsessed with sex and pornography, having repeatedly written in his diaries about his desire to experience sex before he died.
A book entitled "Rape of a Normal Mind" was later written about the incident.

Emil Kolben

Emil Kolben (1 November 1862 in Strančice – 3 July 1943 in Terezín) was an engineer and entrepreneur from Bohemia. The large engineering company ČKD bears his name. He died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp.
Biography.
Kolben was born into the German-speaking Jewish family of a small shopkeeper in the village of Strančice, southeast from Prague. He had nine siblings and from the age of 15 he was left to care for himself. After completing his secondary education in Prague, Kolben studied there at the German Technical University. After finishing university he obtained a two-year Gerstner's stipend that allowed him to study abroad. In 1887 he traveled to Zürich, Paris and London and in April 1888 he sailed with his wife Malvinus to the United States, where he stayed for five years. After arriving in New York he set off on further study trips traveling across the country. He obtained a position as an engineer at the Edison Machine Works in Schenectady, then as an assistant of Thomas Edison in Orange, New Jersey and finally as the chief-engineer in Edison's laboratories. In 1889 he visited the laboratory of Nikola Tesla to learn about the poly-phase alternating current motors and power system the inventor was developing there.
In 1892 Kolben returned to Europe and for two years worked as the chief-designer in Switzerland for company Oerlikon which manufactured poly-phase alternating current generators. In 1896 he returned to Bohemia and, in the same year, set up a company named ""Kolben a spol." in Vysočany, an industrial district of Prague. A 60 kW alternator was the first system constructed. With secured financial investment from a bank the company became a stock holding company in 1898. In 1899 it was renamed to "Elektrotechnická a. s.". In 1911 Kolben invited Edison to visit Prague.
The company produced large electrotechnical systems such as hydro-electric power stations, locomotives and machines. Used technologies and equipment were much above standards of the time – for example instead of using a centralized power source and mechanical transmitters the machines were fitted with electrical engines.
In 1921 the company merged with another engineering company "Českomoravská strojírna" into "Českomoravská-Kolben a. s.". In 1927 it merged with "A. s. strojírny" (formerly "Breitfeld &amp; Daněk") into "Českomoravská-Kolben-Daněk", the ČKD. Kolben had served as the director until 1939. The company produced a wide array of electrotechnic and engineering systems and also complete industrial plants. ČKD employed up to 15,000 people.
Kolben also founded two other companies: "Pražská továrna na káble" in Prague-Hostivař (power cables) and "Pražská elektroinstalační společnost"" in Prague-Hloubětín (wiring systems). He published dozens of articles, mostly about electrotechnic and engineering.
Immediately after the occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi-Germany (1939) Kolben was recalled from his position as the director (March 16) and later imprisoned in the concentration camp Theresienstadt. He died there abandoned and exhausted. Almost all members of his family were imprisoned; 26 of them were killed by the Germans. His grandson Jindřich (b. 1926) survived.
ČKD was heavily damaged during the last days of World War II. It later employed up to 50,000 people and was known mainly for locomotives and trams. Mismanagement during the new free-market era (1990s) and technological delay accumulated during previous decades resulted in bankruptcy in 1998 and a massive reduction in production.

Armenian genocide denial

Armenian genocide denial is the negationist and racist claim that the Ottoman Empire and its ruling party, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), did not commit genocide against its Armenian citizens during World War I—a crime documented in a large body of evidence and affirmed by the vast majority of scholars. The perpetrators denied the genocide as they carried it out, claiming that Armenians in the Ottoman Empire were resettled for military reasons, not exterminated. In its aftermath, incriminating documents were systematically destroyed. Denial has been the policy of every government of the Ottoman Empire's successor state, the Republic of Turkey, .
Borrowing arguments used by the CUP to justify its actions, Armenian genocide denial rests on the assumption that the deportation of Armenians was a legitimate state action in response to a real or perceived Armenian uprising that threatened the empire's existence during wartime. Deniers assert that the CUP intended to resettle Armenians, not kill them. They claim the death toll is exaggerated or attribute the deaths to other factors, such as a purported civil war, disease, bad weather, rogue local officials, or bands of Kurds and outlaws. The historian Ronald Grigor Suny summarizes the main argument as: "There was no genocide, and the Armenians were to blame for it."
A critical reason for denial is that the genocide enabled the establishment of a Turkish nation-state; recognizing it would contradict Turkey's founding myths. Since the 1920s, Turkey has worked to prevent recognition or even mention of the genocide in other countries. It has spent millions of dollars on lobbying, created research institutes, and used intimidation and threats. Denial, according to Donald Bloxham, is usually accompanied by "rhetoric of Armenian treachery, aggression, criminality, and territorial ambition". Denial affects Turkey's domestic policies and is taught in Turkish schools; some Turkish citizens who recognize the genocide have faced prosecution for "insulting Turkishness". Turkey's century-long effort to deny the genocide sets it apart from other historical cases of genocide.
Azerbaijan, a close ally of Turkey, also denies the genocide and campaigns against its recognition internationally. Most Turkish citizens and political parties support Turkey's denial policy. Scholars argue that Armenian genocide denial has set the tone for the government's attitude towards minorities, and has contributed to the ongoing violence against Kurds in Turkey. A 2014 poll of 1,500 people conducted by EDAM, a Turkish think tank, found that nine percent of Turkish citizens recognize the genocide.
Background.
The presence of Armenians in Anatolia is documented since the sixth century BC, almost two millennia before Turkish presence in the area. The Ottoman Empire effectively treated Armenians and other non-Muslims as second-class citizens under Islamic rule, even after the nineteenth-century Tanzimat reforms intended to equalize their status. By the 1890s, Armenians faced forced conversions to Islam and increasing land seizures, which led a handful to join revolutionary parties such as the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF, also known as Dashnaktsutyun). In the mid-1890s, state-sponsored Hamidian massacres killed at least 100,000 Armenians, and in 1909, the authorities failed to prevent the Adana massacre, which resulted in the death of some 17,000 Armenians. The Ottoman authorities denied any responsibility for these massacres, accusing Western powers of meddling and Armenians of provocation, while presenting Muslims as the main victims and failing to punish the perpetrators. These same tropes of denial would be employed later to deny the Armenian genocide.
The Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) came to power in two coups in 1908 and in 1913. In the meantime, the Ottoman Empire lost almost all of its European territory in the Balkan Wars; the CUP blamed Christian treachery for this defeat. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees fled to Anatolia as a result of the wars; many were resettled in the Armenian-populated eastern provinces and harbored resentment against Christians. In August 1914, CUP representatives appeared at an ARF conference demanding that in the event of war with the Russian Empire, the ARF incite Russian Armenians to intervene on the Ottoman side. The ARF declined, instead declaring that Armenians should fight for the countries in which they were citizens. In October 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers.
Armenian genocide.
During the Ottoman invasion of Russian and Persian territory in late 1914, Ottoman paramilitaries massacred local Armenians. A few Ottoman Armenian soldiers defected to Russia—seized upon by both the CUP and later deniers as evidence of Armenian treachery—but the Armenian volunteers in the Russian army were mostly Russian Armenians. Massacres turned into genocide following the catastrophic Ottoman defeat by Russia in the Battle of Sarikamish (January 1915), which was blamed on Armenian treachery. Armenian soldiers and officers were removed from their posts pursuant to a 25 February order issued by Minister of War Enver Pasha. In the minds of the Ottoman leaders, isolated incidents of Armenian resistance were taken as evidence of a general insurrection.
In mid-April, after Ottoman leaders had decided to commit genocide, Armenians barricaded themselves in the eastern city of Van. The defense of Van served as a pretext for anti-Armenian actions at the time and remains a crucial element in works that seek to deny or justify the genocide. On 24 April, hundreds of Armenian intellectuals were arrested in Constantinople. Systematic deportation of Armenians began, given a cover of legitimacy by the 27 May deportation law. The Special Organization guarded the deportation convoys consisting mostly of women, children, and the elderly who were subject to systematic rape and massacres. Their destination was the Syrian Desert, where those who survived the death marches were left to die of starvation or disease in makeshift camps. Deportation was only carried out in the areas away from active fighting; near the front lines, Armenians were massacred outright. The leaders of the CUP ordered the deportations, with interior minister Talat Pasha, aware that he was sending the Armenians to their deaths, taking a leading role. In a cable dated 13 July 1915, Talat stated that "the aim of the Armenian deportations is the final solution of the Armenian Question."
Historians estimate that 1.5 to 2 million Armenians lived in the Ottoman Empire in 1915, of whom 800,000 to 1.2 million were deported during the genocide. In 1916, a wave of massacres targeted the surviving Armenians in Syria; by the end of the year, only 200,000 were still alive. An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 women and children were integrated into Muslim families through such methods as forced marriage, adoption and conversion. The state confiscated and redistributed property belonging to murdered or deported Armenians. During the Russian occupation of eastern Anatolia, Russian and Armenian forces massacred as many as 60,000 Muslims. Making a false equivalence between these killings and the genocide is a central argument of denial.
The genocide is documented extensively in Ottoman archives, documents collected by foreign diplomats (including those from neutral countries and Ottoman allies), eyewitness reports by Armenian survivors and Western missionaries, and the proceedings of the Ottoman Special Military Tribunals. Talat Pasha kept his own statistical record, which revealed a massive discrepancy between the number of Armenians deported in 1915 and those surviving in 1917. The vast majority of non-Turkish scholars accept the genocide as a historical fact, and an increasing number of Turkish historians are also acknowledging and studying the genocide.
Origins.
Ottoman Empire.
Genocide denial is the minimization of an event established as genocide, either by denying the facts or by denying the intent of the perpetrators. Denial was present from the outset as an integral part of the Armenian genocide, which was perpetrated under the guise of resettlement. Denial emerged because of the Ottoman desire to maintain American neutrality in the war and German financial and military support.
In May 1915, Russia, Britain, and France sent a diplomatic communiqué to the Ottoman government condemning the Ottoman "crimes against humanity" and threatening to hold accountable any Ottoman officials who were responsible. The Ottoman government denied that massacres of Armenians had occurred, and said that Armenians colluded with the enemy, while asserting that national sovereignty allowed them to take measures against the Armenians. It also alleged that Armenians had massacred Muslims and accused the Allies of committing war crimes.
In early 1916, the Ottoman government published a two-volume work titled "The Armenian Aspirations and Revolutionary Movements", denying it had tried to exterminate the Armenian people. At the time, little credence was given to such statements internationally, but some Muslims, previously ashamed by crimes against Armenians, changed their mind in response to propaganda about atrocities allegedly committed by Armenians. The themes of genocide denial that originated during the war were later recycled in Turkey's denial of the genocide.
Turkish nationalist movement.
The Armenian genocide itself played a key role in the destruction of the Ottoman Empire and the foundation of the Turkish republic. The destruction of the Christian middle class, and redistribution of their properties, enabled the creation of a new Muslim/Turkish bourgeoisie. There was significant continuity between the Ottoman Empire and Republic of Turkey, and the Republican People's Party was the successor of the Committee of Union and Progress that carried out the genocide. The Turkish nationalist movement depended on support from those who had perpetrated the genocide or enriched themselves from it, creating an incentive for silence. Denial and minimization of wartime atrocities was crucial to the formation of a Turkish nationalist consensus.
Following the genocide, many survivors sought an Armenian state in eastern Anatolia; warfare between Turkish nationalists and Armenians was fierce, atrocities being committed on both sides. Later political demands and Armenian killings of Muslims have often been used to retroactively justify the 1915 genocide. The Treaty of Sèvres granted Armenians a large territory in eastern Anatolia, but this provision was never implemented because of the Turkish invasion of Armenia in 1920. Turkish troops conducted massacres of Armenian survivors in Cilicia and killed around 200,000 Armenians following the invasion of the Caucasus and the First Republic of Armenia; thus, historian Rouben Paul Adalian has argued that "Mustafa Kemal [the leader of the Turkish nationalist movement] completed what Talaat and Enver had started in 1915."
The Ottoman government in Constantinople held courts-martial of a handful of perpetrators in 1919 to appease Western powers. Even so, the evidence was sabotaged, and many perpetrators were encouraged to escape to the interior. The reality of state-sponsored mass killing was not denied, but many circles of society considered it necessary and justified. As a British Foreign Office report stated, "not one Turk in a thousand can conceive that there might be a Turk who deserves to be hanged for the killing of Christians." Kemal repeatedly accused Armenians of plotting the extermination of Muslims in Anatolia. He contrasted the "murderous Armenians" to Turks, portrayed as a completely innocent and oppressed nation. In 1919, Kemal defended the Ottoman government's policies towards Christians, saying "Whatever has befallen the non-Muslim elements living in our country, is the result of the policies of separatism they pursued in a savage manner, when they allowed themselves to be made tools of foreign intrigues and abused their privileges."
In Turkey.
Causes.
Historian Erik-Jan Zürcher argues that, since the Turkish nationalist movement depended on the support of a broad coalition of actors that benefitted from the genocide, it was impossible to break with the past. From the founding of the republic, the genocide has been viewed as a necessity and "raison d'état". Many of the main perpetrators, including Talat Pasha, were hailed as national heroes of Turkey; many schools, streets, and mosques are still named after them. Those convicted and sentenced to death by the postwar tribunal for crimes against Armenians, such as Mehmet Kemal and Behramzade Nusret, were proclaimed national and glorious martyrs and their families were rewarded by the state with confiscated Armenian properties. Turkish historian Taner Akçam states that, "It's not easy for a nation to call its founding fathers murderers and thieves." Kieser and other historians argue that "the single most important reason for this inability to accept culpability is the centrality of the Armenian massacres for the formation of the Turkish nation-state." Turkish historian Doğan Gürpınar says that acknowledging the genocide would bring into question the foundational assumptions of the Turkish nation-state.
One factor in explaining denial is Sèvres syndrome, a popular belief that Turkey is besieged by implacable enemies. Despite the unlikelihood that recognition would lead to any territorial changes, many Turkish officials believe that genocide recognition is part of a plot to partition Turkey or extract other reparations. Acknowledgement of the genocide is perceived by the state as a threat to Turkey's national security, and Turks who do so are seen as traitors. During his fieldwork in an Anatolian village in the 1980s, anthropologist Sam Kaplan found that "a visceral fear of Armenians returning ... and reclaiming their lands still gripped local imagination".
Destruction and concealment of evidence.
An edict of the Ottoman government banned foreigners from taking photographs of Armenian refugees or the corpses that accumulated on the sides of the roads on which death marches were carried out. Violators were threatened with arrest. Strictly enforced censorship laws prevented Armenian survivors from publishing memoirs, prohibiting "any publication at odds with the general policies of the state". Those who acknowledge the genocide have been prosecuted under laws against "insulting Turkishness". Talat Pasha had decreed that "everything must be done to abolish even the word 'Armenia' in Turkey". In the postwar Turkish republic, Armenian cultural heritage has been subject to systematic destruction in an attempt to eradicate the Armenian presence. On 5 January 1916, Enver Pasha ordered all place names of Greek, Armenian, or Bulgarian origin to be changed, a policy fully implemented in the later republic, continuing into the 1980s. Mass graves of genocide victims have also been destroyed, although many still exist. After the 1918 armistice, incriminating documents in the Ottoman archives were systematically destroyed. The records of the postwar courts-martial in Constantinople have also disappeared. Recognizing that some archival documents supported its position, the Turkish government announced that the archives relevant to the "Armenian question" would be opened in 1985. According to Turkish historian Halil Berktay, diplomat conducted a second purge of the archives at this time. The archives were officially opened in 1989, but in practice, some archives remained sealed, and access to other archives was restricted to scholars sympathetic to the official Turkish narrative.
Turkish historiography.
In Mustafa Kemal's 1927 "Nutuk" speech, which was the foundation of Kemalist historiography, the tactics of silence and denial are employed to deal with violence against Armenians. As in his other speeches, he presents Turks as innocent of any wrongdoing and as victims of horrific Armenian atrocities. For decades, Turkish historiography ignored the Armenian genocide. One of the early exceptions was the genocide perpetrator Esat Uras, who published "The Armenians in History and the Armenian Question" in 1950. Uras's book, probably written in response to post–World War II Soviet territorial claims, was a novel synthesis of earlier arguments deployed by the CUP during the war, and linked wartime denial with the "official narrative" on the genocide developed in the 1980s.
In the 1980s, following Armenian efforts for recognition of the genocide and a wave of assassinations by Armenian militants, Turkey began to present an official narrative of the "Armenian question", which it framed as an issue of contemporary terrorism rather than historical genocide. Retired diplomats were recruited to write denialist works, completed without professional methodology or ethical standards and based on cherry-picking archival information favorable to Turks and unfavorable to Armenians. The Council of Higher Education was set up in 1981 by the Turkish military junta, and has been instrumental in cementing "an alternative, 'national' scholarship with its own reference system", according to Gürpınar. Besides academic research, Türkkaya Ataöv taught the first university course on the "Armenian question" in 1983. By the twenty-first century, the Turkish Historical Society, known for publications upholding the official position of the Turkish government, had as one of its main functions the countering of genocide claims.
Around 1990, Taner Akçam, working in Germany, was the first Turkish historian to acknowledge and study the genocide. During the 1990s, private universities began to be established in Turkey, enabling challenges to state-sponsored views. In 2005, academics at three Turkish universities organized an academic conference dealing with the genocide. Scheduled to be held in May 2005, the conference was suspended following a campaign of intimidation, but eventually held in September. The conference represented the first major challenge to Turkey's founding myths in the public discourse of the country and resulted in the creation of an alternative, non-denialist historiography by elite academics in Istanbul and Ankara, in parallel to an ongoing denialist historiography. Turkish academics who accept and study the genocide as fact have been subjected to death threats and prosecution for insulting Turkishness. Western scholars generally ignore the Turkish denialist historiography because they consider its methods unscholarly—especially the selective use of sources.
Education.
Turkish schools, public or private, are required to use history textbooks approved by the Ministry of Education. The state uses this monopoly to increase support for the official denialist position, vilifying Armenians and presenting them as enemies. For decades, these textbooks did not mention Armenians as part of Ottoman history. Since the 1980s, textbooks discuss the "events of 1915", but deflect the blame from the Ottoman government to other actors. They accuse imperialist powers of manipulating the Armenians to undermine the empire, and allege that the Armenians committed treason or presented a threat. Some textbooks admit that deportations occurred and Armenians died, but present this action as necessary and justified. Since 2005, textbooks have accused Armenians of perpetrating genocide against Turkish Muslims. In 2003, students in each grade level were instructed to write essays refuting the genocide.
Society.
For decades, the genocide was a taboo subject in Turkish society. Göçek states that it is the interaction between state and society that makes denial so persistent. Besides the Turkish state, Turkish intellectuals and civil society have also denied the genocide. Turkish fiction dealing with the genocide typically denies it, while claiming the fictional narrative is based on true events. Noting many people in eastern Turkey have passed down memories of the event, genocide scholar Uğur Ümit Üngör says that "the Turkish government is denying a genocide that its own population remembers." The Turkish state and most of society have engaged in similar silencing regarding other ethnic persecutions and human rights violations in the Ottoman Empire and Republican Turkey against Greeks, Assyrians, Kurds, Jews and Alevis.
Most Turks support the state's policies with regard to genocide denial. Some admit that massacres occurred but regard them as justified responses to Armenian treachery. Many still consider Armenians to be a fifth column. According to Halil Karaveli, "the word [genocide] incites strong, emotional reactions among Turks from all walks of society and of every ideological inclination". Turkish–Armenian journalist Hrant Dink was outspoken in his advocacy for facing historical truths to achieve a better society and reconciliation between ethnic groups. He was prosecuted for insulting Turkishness and was assassinated in 2007 by a Turkish ultranationalist. In 2013, a study sampling Turkish university students in the United States found that 65% agreed with the official view that Armenian deaths occurred as a result of "inter-communal warfare" and that another 10% blamed Armenians for causing the violence. A 2014 survey found that only 9% of Turkish citizens thought their government should recognize the genocide. Many believe that such an acknowledgement is imposed by Armenians and foreign powers with no benefit to Turkey. Many Kurds, who themselves have suffered political repression in Turkey, have recognized and condemned the genocide.
Politics.
The Islamic conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2002 and took an approach to history that was critical of both the CUP and the early Republican era. This position initially led to some liberalization and a wider range of views that could be expressed in the public sphere. The AKP presented its approach to the "events of 1915" as an alternative to genocide denial and genocide recognition, by emphasizing shared suffering. Over time, and especially since the 2016 failed coup, the AKP government became increasingly authoritarian; political repression and censorship has made it more difficult to discuss controversial topics such as the Armenian genocide. , all major political parties in Turkey, except the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), as well as many pro- and anti-government media and civil society organizations, support denial. Both government and opposition parties have strongly opposed genocide recognition in other countries. No Turkish government has admitted what happened to the Armenians was a crime, let alone a genocide. On 24 April 2019, president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan tweeted, "The relocation of the Armenian gangs and their supporters... was the most reasonable action that could be taken in such a period".
Foreign relations of Turkey.
Turkish efforts to project its genocide denial overseas date to the 1920s, or, alternately, to the genocide itself. Turkey's century-long effort to deny the Armenian genocide sets this genocide apart from others in history. According to genocide scholar Roger W. Smith, "In no other instance has a government gone to such extreme lengths to deny that a massive genocide took place." Central to Turkey's ability to deny the genocide and counter its recognition is the country's strategic position in the Middle East, Cold War alliance with the West, and membership of NATO. Historians have described the role of other countries in enabling Turkey's genocide denial as a form of collusion.
At the Lausanne Conference of 1922–1923, Turkish representatives repeated the version of Armenian history that had been developed during the war. The resulting Treaty of Lausanne annulled the previous Treaty of Sèvres which had mandated the prosecution of Ottoman war criminals and the restoration of property to Christian survivors. Instead, Lausanne granted impunity to all perpetrators. After the 1980 Turkish military coup, Turkey developed more institutionalized ways of countering genocide claims. In 1981, the foreign ministry established a dedicated office (İAGM) specifically to promote Turkey's view of the Armenian genocide. In 2001, a further centralization created the Committee to Coordinate the Struggle with the Baseless Genocide Claims (ASİMKK). The Institute for Armenian Research, a think tank which focuses exclusively on the Armenian issue, was created in 2001 following the French Parliament's recognition of the genocide. ASİMKK disbanded after the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum.
According to sociologist Levon Chorbajian, Turkey's "modus operandi remains consistent throughout and seeks maximalist positions, offers no compromise though sometimes hints at it, and employs intimidation and threats." Motivated by belief in a global Jewish conspiracy, the Turkish foreign ministry has recruited Turkish Jews to participate in denialist efforts. Turkish Jewish leaders helped defeat resolutions recognizing the genocide, and avoid mentioning it at academic conferences and in Holocaust museums. , Turkey spends millions of dollars each year lobbying against the genocide's recognition. Akçam stated in 2020 that Turkey has definitively lost the information war over the Armenian genocide on both the academic and diplomatic fronts, its official narrative being treated like ordinary denialism.
Germany.
From 1915 to 1918, Germany and the Ottoman Empire undertook "joint propaganda efforts of denial." German newspapers repeated the Ottoman government's denial of committing atrocities and stories of alleged Armenian treachery. The government censorship handbook mandated strict limits on speech about Armenians, although penalties for violations were light. On 11 January 1916, socialist deputy Karl Liebknecht raised the issue of the Armenian genocide in the Reichstag, receiving the reply that the Ottoman government "has been forced, due to the seditious machinations of our enemies, to transfer the Armenian population of certain areas, and to assign them new places of residence." Laughter interrupted Liebknecht's follow-up questions. During the 1921 trial of Soghomon Tehlirian for the assassination of Talat Pasha, so much evidence was revealed that denial became untenable. German nationalists instead portrayed what they acknowledged as the intentional extermination of the Armenian people as justified.
In March 2006, Turkish nationalist groups organized two rallies in Berlin intended to commemorate "the murder of Talat Pasha" and protest "the lie of genocide." German politicians criticized the march, and turnout was low. When the Bundestag voted to recognize the Armenian genocide in 2016, Turkish media harshly criticized the resolution and eleven deputies of Turkish origin received police protection because of death threats. Germany's large Turkish community has been cited as a reason why the government hesitated, and Turkish organizations lobbied against the resolution and organized demonstrations.
United States.
Historian Donald Bloxham states that, "In a very real sense, 'genocide denial' was accepted and furthered by the United States government before the term genocide had even been coined." In interwar Turkey, prominent American diplomats like Mark Lambert Bristol and Joseph Grew endorsed the Turkish nationalist view that the Armenian genocide was a war against the forces of imperialism. In 1922, before receiving the Chester concession, Colby Chester argued that Christians of Anatolia were not massacred; his writing exhibited many of the themes of later genocide denial. In the 1930s, the Turkish embassy scuttled a planned film adaptation of Franz Werfel's popular novel "The Forty Days of Musa Dagh" by the American company MGM, threatening a boycott of American films. Turkish embassies, with the support of the US State Department, shot down attempts to revive the film in the 1950s and 1960s.
Turkey began political lobbying around 1975. Şükrü Elekdağ, Turkish ambassador to the United States from 1979 to 1989, worked aggressively to counter the trend of Armenian genocide recognition by courting academics, business interests, and Jewish groups. Committee members of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum reported Elekdağ told them that the safety of Jews in Turkey was not guaranteed if the museum covered the Armenian genocide. Under his tenure, the Institute of Turkish Studies (ITS) was set up, funded by $3 million from Turkey, and the country spent $1 million annually on public relations. In 2000, Elekdağ complained ITS had "lost its function and its effectiveness." Turkey threatened to cut off the United States' access to key air bases in Turkey, were it to recognize the genocide. In 2007, a Congressional resolution for genocide recognition failed because of Turkish pressure. Opponents of the bill said a genocide had taken place, but argued against formal recognition to preserve good relations with Turkey. Each year since 1994, the United States president has issued a commemorative message on 24 April. Turkey has sometimes made concessions to keep the president from using the word "genocide". In 2019, both houses of Congress passed resolutions formally recognizing the genocide. On 24 April 2021, the Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, President Joe Biden referred to the events as "genocide" in a statement released by the White House. On 24 April 2025, officials of the second Donald Trump administration referred to the genocide without using the word "genocide".
United Kingdom.
Human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson charged that around 2000, "genocide denial had entrenched itself in the Eastern Department [of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)]... to such an extent that it was briefing ministers with a bare-faced disregard for readily ascertainable facts", such as its own records from the time. In 2006, in response to a debate initiated by MP Steven Pound, a representative of the FCO said the United Kingdom did not recognize the genocide because "the evidence is not sufficiently unequivocal".
Israel.
According to historians Rıfat Bali and Marc David Baer, Armenian genocide denial was the most important factor in the normalization of Israel–Turkey relations. The 1982 International Conference on the Holocaust and Genocide, which took place in Tel Aviv, included six presentations on the Armenian genocide. Turkey threatened that if the conference was held, it would close its borders to Jewish refugees from Iran and Syria, putting their lives in danger. As a result, the Israeli Foreign Ministry joined the ultimately unsuccessful effort to cancel the conference.
In April 2001, a Turkish newspaper quoted foreign minister Shimon Peres as saying, "We reject attempts to create a similarity between the Holocaust and the Armenian allegations. Nothing similar to the Holocaust occurred. It is a tragedy what the Armenians went through, but not a genocide." According to Charny and Auron, this statement crossed the line into active denial of the Armenian genocide. Scholar Eldad Ben Aharon considers that Peres simply made explicit what had been Israel's policy since 1948. Israel–Turkey relations deteriorated in the late 2010s, but Israel's relations with Azerbaijan are close and the Azerbaijan–Israel International Association has lobbied against recognition of the genocide.
Denialism in academia.
Until the twenty-first century, Ottoman and Turkish studies marginalized the killings of Armenians, which many academics portrayed as a wartime measure justified by emergency and avoided discussing in depth. These fields have long enjoyed close institutional links with the Turkish state. Statements by these academics were cited to further the Turkish denial agenda. Historians who recognized the genocide feared professional retaliation for expressing their views. The methodology of denial has been compared to the tactics of the tobacco industry or global warming denial: funding of biased research, creating a smokescreen of doubt, and thereby manufacturing a controversy where there is no genuine academic dispute.
Beginning in the 1980s, the Turkish government has funded research institutes to prevent recognition of the genocide. On 19 May 1985, "The New York Times" and "The Washington Post" ran an advertisement from the Assembly of Turkish American Associations in which 69 academics—most of the professors of Ottoman history working in the United States at the time—called on Congress not to adopt the resolution on the Armenian genocide. Many of the signatories received research grants funded by the Turkish government, and a majority were not specialists on the late Ottoman Empire. Heath Lowry, director of the Institute of Turkish Studies, helped secure the signatures; for his efforts, Lowry received the Foundation for the Promotion and Recognition of Turkey Prize. Over the next decade, Turkey funded six chairs of Ottoman and Turkish studies to counter recognition of the genocide; Lowry was appointed to one of the chairs. According to historian Keith David Watenpaugh, the resolution had "a terrible and lasting influence on the rising generation of scholars." In 2000, Elekdağ admitted the statement had become useless because none of the original signatories besides Justin McCarthy would agree to sign another, similar declaration.
More recent academic denialism in the United States has focused on an alleged Armenian uprising, said to justify the persecution of Armenians as a legitimate counterinsurgency. In 2009, the University of Utah opened its "Turkish Studies Project", funded by the Turkish Coalition of America (TCA) and led by M. Hakan Yavuz, with Elekdağ on the advisory board. The University of Utah Press has published several books denying the genocide, beginning with Guenter Lewy's "The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey" (2006). Lewy's book had been rejected by eleven publishers and, according to Marc Mamigonian, became "one of the key texts of modern denial". TCA has also provided financial support to several authors including McCarthy, Michael Gunter, Yücel Güçlü, and Edward J. Erickson for writing books that deny the Armenian genocide. According to Richard G. Hovannisian, of recent deniers in academia, almost all have connections to Turkey and those with Turkish citizenship have all worked for the Turkish foreign ministry.
Academic integrity controversies.
Many scholars consider it unethical for academics to deny the Armenian genocide. Beyond that, there have been several controversies about academic integrity relating to denial of the genocide. In 1990, psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton received a letter from Nüzhet Kandemir, Turkish ambassador to the United States, questioning references to the Armenian genocide in one of Lifton's books. The ambassador inadvertently included a draft of a letter from Lowry advising the ambassador on how to prevent mention of the Armenian genocide in scholarly works. Lowry was later named Atatürk Professor of Ottoman Studies at Princeton University, which the Turkish government had endowed with a $750,000 grant. His actions were described as "subversion of scholarship"; he later said it was a mistake to have written the letter.
In 2006, Ottomanist historian Donald Quataert—one of the 69 signatories of the 1985 statement to the United States Congress—reviewed "The Great Game of Genocide", a book about the Armenian genocide, agreeing that "genocide" was the right word to use; the article challenged what Quataert termed "the Ottomanist wall of silence" on the issue. Weeks later, he resigned as chairman of the board of directors of the Institute of Turkish Studies after Turkish officials threatened that if he did not retract his statements, the institute's funding would be withdrawn. Several members of the board resigned and both the Middle East Studies Association and Turkish Studies Association criticized the violation of Quataert's academic freedom.
In a lecture he delivered in June 2011, Akçam stated that a Turkish foreign ministry official told him that the Turkish government was offering money to academics in the United States for denial of the genocide, noting the coincidence between what his source said and Gunter's book "Armenian History and the Question of Genocide". Hovannisian believes that books denying the genocide are published because of flaws in peer review leading to "a strong linkage among several mutually sympathetic reviewers" without submitting the books to academics who would point out errors.
Examination of claims.
The official Turkish view is based on the belief that the Armenian genocide was a legitimate state action and therefore cannot be challenged on legal or moral grounds. Publications from this point of view share many of the basic facts with non-denialist histories, but differ in their interpretation and emphases. CUP leaders decided to commit genocide in large part because they perceived Armenians as an existential threat to the empire in a time of war; denialist works follow this line of reasoning, while rejecting the CUP's intent to exterminate the Armenian people. Historian Ronald Grigor Suny summarizes the main denialist argument as, "There was no genocide, and the Armenians were to blame for it."
Denialist works portray Armenians as terrorists and secessionists, shifting the blame from the CUP to the Armenians. According to this logic, the deportations of Armenian civilians was a justified and proportionate response to Armenian treachery, either real or as perceived by the Ottoman authorities. Proponents attribute collective guilt to all Armenians for the military resistance of some, despite the fact that the law of war criminalizes the deliberate killing of civilians. Talat Pasha admitted to "not making a distinction between guilty and innocent Armenians", stating it was impossible because "one who was still innocent today could be guilty tomorrow". Deaths are blamed on factors beyond the control of the Ottoman authorities, such as weather, disease, or rogue local officials. The role of the Special Organization is denied and massacres are instead blamed on Kurds, "brigands", and "armed gangs" that supposedly operated outside the control of the central government.
Other arguments include:
Denial of the Armenian genocide is compared frequently to Holocaust denial because of similar tactics of misrepresenting evidence, false equivalence, claiming that atrocities were invented by war propaganda and that powerful lobbies manufacture genocide allegations for their own profit, subsuming one-sided systematic extermination into war deaths, and shifting blame from the perpetrators to the victims of genocide. Both forms of negationism share the goal of rehabilitating the ideologies which brought genocide about.
Legality.
According to former International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) judge Flavia Lattanzi, the present Turkish government's "denial of past Ottoman and Turkish authorities' wrongdoings is a new violation of international law".
Some European countries have adopted laws to criminalize denial of the genocide; such laws are controversial, opponents arguing that they erode freedom of speech. In 1993, French newspapers printed several interviews with British-American historian Bernard Lewis in which he argued there was no Armenian genocide because the Armenians brought their fate upon themselves. A French state prosecutor brought criminal proceedings against him for these statements under the Gayssot Law. The prosecution failed, as the court determined that the law did not apply to events before World War II. In a 1995 civil proceeding brought by three Armenian genocide survivors, a French court censured Lewis' remarks under Article 1382 of the Civil Code and fined him one franc, and ordering the publication of the judgment at Lewis' cost in "Le Monde". The court ruled that while Lewis has the right to his views, their expression harmed a third party and that "it is only by hiding elements which go against his thesis that the defendant was able to state there was no 'serious proof' of the Armenian Genocide".
In March 2007, a Swiss court found Doğu Perinçek, a member of the Talat Pasha Committee (named after the main perpetrator of the genocide), guilty under the Swiss law that outlawed genocide denial. Perinçek appealed; in December, the Swiss Supreme Court confirmed his sentence. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) overturned the verdict in "Perinçek v. Switzerland" on freedom of speech grounds. Since the ECtHR has ruled that member states may criminalize Holocaust denial, the verdict has been criticized for creating a double standard between the Holocaust and other genocides, along with failure to acknowledge anti-Armenianism as a motivation for genocide denial. Although the court did not rule on whether the events of 1915 constituted genocide, several separate opinions recognized the genocide as a historical fact. Perinçek misrepresented the verdict by saying, "We put an end to the genocide lie."
Consequences.
Kieser, Göçek, and Cheterian state that ongoing denial prevents Turkey from achieving a full democracy including pluralism and human rights, and that this denial fosters state repression of minority groups in Turkey, especially Kurds. Akçam says that genocide denial "rationaliz[es] the violent persecution of religious and ethnic minorities" and desensitizes the population to future episodes of mass violence. Until the Turkish state acknowledges genocide, he argues, "there is a potential there, always, that it can do it again". Vicken Cheterian says that genocide denial "pollutes the political culture of entire societies, where violence and threats become part of a political exercise degrading basic rights and democratic practice". When recognizing the Armenian genocide in April 2015, Pope Francis added, "concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it".
Denial has also affected Armenians, particularly those who live in Turkey. Historian Talin Suciyan states that the Armenian genocide and its denial "led to a series of other policies that perpetuated the process by liquidating their properties, silencing and marginalising the survivors, and normalising all forms of violence against them". According to an article in the "Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment &amp; Trauma", "[d]enial prevents healing of the wounds inflicted by genocide, and constitutes an attack on the collective identity and national cultural continuity of the victimized people". Göçek argues "the lack of acknowledgement literally prevents the wounds opened by past violence to ever heal". The activities of Armenian militant groups in the 1970s and 1980s, like the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia and the Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide, was caused partly by the failure of peaceful efforts to elicit Turkish acknowledgement of the genocide. Some historians, such as Stefan Ihrig, have argued that impunity for the perpetrators of the Armenian genocide, as well as silence or justification from bystanders of the crime, emboldened the perpetrators of the Holocaust.
International relations.
Turkey closed its border with Armenia in 1993, following the First Nagorno-Karabakh War between Armenia and Turkic-speaking Azerbaijan. The closed border harms the economies of Armenia and eastern Turkey. Although Armenia was willing to normalize relations without preconditions, Turkey demanded that the Armenian side abandon all support for the recognition efforts of the Armenian diaspora. There have been two major attempts at Turkish-Armenian reconciliation—the Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission (2000–2004) and the Zurich Protocols (2009)—both of which failed partly because of the controversy over the Armenian genocide. In both cases, the mediators did their best to sideline historical disputes, which proved impossible. Armenian diaspora groups opposed both initiatives and especially a historical commission to investigate what they considered established facts. Bloxham asserts that since "denial has always been accompanied by rhetoric of Armenian treachery, aggression, criminality, and territorial ambition, it actually enunciates an ongoing if latent threat of Turkish 'revenge'."
Since the beginning of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Azerbaijan has adopted Turkey's genocide denial and worked to promote it internationally. The Armenian genocide is also widely denied by Azerbaijani civil society. Many Armenians saw a connection between the genocide and later anti-Armenian violence like the 1988 Sumgait pogrom, though the connection between the Karabakh conflict and the Armenian genocide is mostly made by Azerbaijani elites. Azerbaijani nationalists accused Armenians of staging the Sumgait pogrom and other anti-Armenian pogroms, similar to the Turkish discourse on the Armenian genocide.
Azerbaijan state propaganda claims that the Armenians have perpetrated a genocide against Azeris over two centuries, a genocide that includes the Treaty of Gulistan (1813), the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828), Baku Commune, the January 1990 deployment of Soviet troops to Baku (following the massacres of Armenians in Baku), and especially the 1992 Khojali massacre. According to this propaganda, Armenians committed "the real genocide" and are accused of killing or deporting as many as 2 million Azeris throughout this period. Following Azerbaijan, Turkey and the Turkish diaspora have lobbied for recognition of the Khojali massacre as a genocide to downplay the Armenian genocide. Azerbaijan sees any country that recognizes the Armenian genocide as an enemy and has even threatened sanctions. Cheterian argues that the "unresolved historic legacy of the 1915 genocide" helped cause the Karabakh conflict and prevent its resolution, while "the ultimate crime itself continues to serve simultaneously as a model and as a threat, as well as a source of existential fear".

Lothar Rădăceanu

Lothar or Lotar Rădăceanu (born "Lothar Würzer" or "Würzel"; May 19, 1899 – August 24, 1955) was a Romanian journalist and linguist, best known as a socialist and communist politician.
Biography.
Early life and politics.
Born to an ethnic German family in Rădăuți, Bukovina (part of Austria-Hungary at the time), he trained in German studies and eventually became a professor at the University of Bucharest.
From early on, Rădăceanu was a member of the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR), one of its main ideologists and representatives in the Chamber of Deputies, as well as a regular contributor to the socialist journals "Libertatea" and "Lumea Nouă".
In the early 1930s, he shared his party's concerns regarding the predominant agricultural character of Romanian economy. He contributed to the "Poporanist" paper "Viața Românească" an article which stated that:
Working in community and cooperative farming are the conditions for survival in peasant-based agriculture.The Social-Democratic Party [...] commits itself to carrying out a campaign of enlightenment in this direction and appeals to all enlightened peasants and all village intellectuals for help in this respect.
He supported his party's alliance with the National Peasantists (PNȚ) during the late 1920s, and their collaboration in the 1928 election, but later criticized the PNȚ government for "proceeding with too little energy with the abolition of reactionary institutions". Like his fellow PSDR member , Rădăceanu advocated the thesis of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea regarding the special conditions for socialism inside the Romanian economical framework; he accepted the views on Romanian economic history as formulated by Ștefan Zeletin, an advocate of economic liberalism, but disagreed with his conclusions regarding the fundamental role of the bourgeoisie.
In late January 1933, the pro-democracy Rădăceanu had criticized the steps taken by King Carol II to institute a more authoritarian regime after the fall of Iuliu Maniu's PNȚ cabinet. Alluding to the event which had been used by Carol — the disagreement between Gavrilă Marinescu, the police prefect of Bucharest and a favourite of the king, and Ion Mihalache, the Minister of the Interior —, he stressed that:
[The Maniu cabinet] was toppled by a police prefect, whom it could not remove from his office. It is not therefore the government who had the power to nominate and recall state officials, but an occult and irresponsible power, of which the Constitution makes no mention.
Equally opposed to Bolshevism, he wrote several analytical articles which criticized Stalinism and the Soviet Union. In 1935, he expressed his views on the risks of the Popular Front tactic as proposed by the Soviets:
The will communism has to collaborate cannot be sincere, as long as — instead of collaborating with the Russian Social-Democrats — they torture them in prisons.
However, he was staunchly opposed to the authorities' crackdown on the outlawed Romanian Communist Party (PCR), and wrote pieces in defence of communist activists prosecuted for their activities. In 1936, when Ana Pauker and other PCR members were being tried, he argued in favour of:
the right [of legal existence] for the communist party as well, [while we are] raising our most energetic protest against the persecution to which this party is being submitted in the country where Goga–Cuzism [that is, the fascist National Christian Party] and Codrenism [that is, the fascist Iron Guard] enjoy all liberties.
Communism.
After 1938, during the time when the PSDR remained active in clandestinity (being banned, together with all other political parties, by King Carol), relations between Rădăceanu and the party leader Constantin Titel Petrescu soured, and he approached the Comintern-backed alliance created by minor parties around the PCR. In 1943, during Ion Antonescu's dictatorship ("see Romania during World War II"), he was, with Mihai Ralea, founder and leader of the Socialist Peasants' Party; Rădăceanu soon after returned to his original party, with journalist Victor Frunză claiming he infiltrated as a secret PCR affiliate. His political adversaries alleged that, during the period, he was also benefiting from good relations with Nazi German officials present in Romania.
In 1944, the August 23 royal coup overthrew Antonescu, taking Romania out of its alliance with the Axis Powers and into the Allied bloc and leading to the reestablishment of pluralism in political life. On November 4 of that year, Rădăceanu joined the Petru Groza cabinet, supported by the PCR, as Minister of Labor.
Romania under Soviet occupation witnessed a growth in influence for the PCR, which sought to impose its domination on the left-wing portion of the political spectrum. Rădăceanu and Ștefan Voitec stood out inside the PSDR as advocates of close collaboration with the communists: in March 1946, a conflict erupted between those two and Titel Petrescu, splitting the party into respective wings. After several clashes inside the party, Titel Petrescu left to form an "Independent Social Democratic Party", while Rădăceanu and Voitec became leaders of a PSDR that had grown to 753,000 members by July 1947. The party, which remained in the "National Democratic Front" created around the PCR, ran on a single platform with the latter in the November 1946 general election (carried by the bloc through widespread electoral fraud). During a campaign stop at the Grivița Railway Yards, Rădăceanu had a confrontation with the PCR leader, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, regarding who is blocking the merger of the PSDR with the PCR. After the election, Rădăceanu stayed on as Minister of Labor in the second Groza government.
Romanian Workers' Party.
In November of the following year, the PCR and PDSR merged to form the "Romanian Workers' Party" (PMR)—a name it would retain until reverting to the PCR name in 1965. A month later, the PMR forced King Michael I to abdicate, marking the founding of the Romanian People's Republic. Rădăceanu served as a secretary of the merged party's Central Committee and a member of the Politburo until his death. In 1946–1947, Rădăceanu was among the delegates to the Paris Peace Conference (a group led by Gheorghe Tătărescu). He was admitted to the Romanian Academy in 1955.
Throughout his later years, he maintained the prospective of a left-wing social democrat within the PMR. He wrote articles for the Cominform magazine "For Lasting Peace, for People's Democracy!" which advised Eastern Bloc social democratic parties (which maintained a decorative existence in some Eastern Bloc countries in order to keep up the appearance of pluralism) to be leery of right-wing deviationism. He died in Helsinki, while attending an international peace congress.
His wife Eugenia was actively promoted to party offices under Nicolae Ceaușescu, benefiting from the support of Elena Ceaușescu (as part of a campaign of introducing women activists in the higher echelon).

David Gillette

David Gillette (March 20, 1946 – February 10, 2025) was an American paleontologist best known for his discovery of the dinosaur "Diplodocus hallorum" in 1985, and more recently for his work studying Pleistocene megafauna such as glyptodonts. At the time of its discovery, "Diplodocus hallorum" was the longest dinosaur known.
Discoveries.
Gillette found eight huge bones of the "Diplodocus" in northwestern New Mexico in May 1985. Gillette began comparing the dinosaur bones he found to those of other dinosaurs. Gillette presented his conclusions in a press conference at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science and in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. He gave the new dinosaur the name "Seismosaurus halli", or "earth shaker." In 1993, Gillette published his book, "Seismosaurus: The Earth Shaker", about his discovery. It was published by Columbia University Press and illustrated by Mark Hallett. The book was re-printed in paperback in 1999.
"Seismosaurus" was later re-categorized as a new species of "Diplodocus", and renamed "Diplodocus hallorum": while the specimen Gillette described was indeed of a novel species, it belonged to the existing Diplodocus genus rather than a previously undiscovered group.
Death.
Gillette died on February 10, 2025, at the age of 78.

Kingdom Come (Jay-Z album)

Kingdom Come is the ninth studio album by American rapper Jay-Z. It was released on November 21, 2006, through Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. It was considered a "comeback album" for the rapper, as 2003's "The Black Album" was promoted as his final release. The production on the album was handled by multiple producers including Just Blaze, DJ Khalil, Dr. Dre, The Neptunes, Swizz Beatz and Kanye West among others. The album also features guest appearances by John Legend, Beyoncé, Usher, Ne-Yo and more.
"Kingdom Come" was supported to four singles: "Show Me What You Got", "Lost One", "30 Something" and "Hollywood". The album received generally lukewarm reviews from music critics but was a commercial success. It debuted at number one on the US "Billboard 200", selling 680,000 copies in its first week. At the 50th Annual Grammy Awards, Jay-Z earned a nomination for Best Rap Album.
Background.
"Kingdom Come" was the first Jay-Z album released since 2003's "The Black Album", which had been widely hyped as Jay-Z's "retirement" album. The video for that album's hit single "99 Problems" had ended with Jay-Z going down in a hail of gunfire. Jay-Z stated in interviews that that scene represented the "death" of Jay-Z and the "rebirth" of Shawn Carter. Because of this, Jay-Z had originally planned to release "Kingdom Come" under his real name of Shawn Carter, but decided in the end to release it under his more-famous stage name Jay-Z. The album's second single, "Lost One" (produced by Dr. Dre) addresses Jay's split with Roc-A-Fella co-founder Damon Dash, the death of his nephew, and supposedly his relationship with actress Rosario Dawson.
Past collaborators Kanye West and particularly Just Blaze made significant contributions to the album's production. This is the first time Dr. Dre has played a substantial role in a Jay-Z album, as he produced four beats and mixed every song on the album. Relatively unknown newcomers B-Money, Syience, and DJ Khalil also contributed to the album's production, as well as Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin. "Kingdom Come"'s opening track "The Prelude" features additional vocals from Pain in da Ass who featured on some of Jay-Z's earlier album introductions, impersonating characters from films such as "Scarface", "Goodfellas", and "Carlito's Way".
Critical reception.
"Kingdom Come" received generally lukewarm reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67, based on 23 reviews. According to "Pitchfork" journalist Peter Macia, "the early consensus on "Kingdom Come" [was] that it's one of Jay-Z's worst albums." He praised the song "Minority Report" writing "It's the only song on Kingdom Come that offers any real insight into the unique position Jay-Z is in, and possibly the only one that anyone will care to remember." Reviewing the record for "Rolling Stone", Rob Sheffield said "the highs are really high, and the lows are really low", particularly applauding the title track and "Trouble" while finding "Beach Chair" especially awful. Nathan Rabin wrote in "The A.V. Club" that contrary to the hype leading up to its release, "Kingdom Come" was "just another solid album" from a rapper who now "succeeds on craft and hard-won experience rather than hunger", finding it devoid of the urgent sense his previous records displayed. Robert Christgau gave it an honorable mention in his "MSN Music" consumer guide, naming "30 Something" and "Minority Report" as highlights while writing that Jay-Z was enjoying "the pleasures of going legit". In "The New York Times", Kelefa Sanneh deemed "Kingdom Come" an intriguing but "halfway successful" attempt by "a grown-up rapper trying to make a grown-up album". AllMusic editor Andy Kellman was more critical, dismissing the record as "a display of complacency and retreads — a gratuitous, easily resistible victory lap — that very slightly upgrades the relative worth of "The Blueprint²"." Jay-Z later considered it to be his worst album.
In the 10th anniversary, Preezy Brown from Vibe write an article about the album and said: ""Kingdom Come" was stacked to the brim with all of the bells and whistles to compensate for any rust on the part of Hov, but ultimately would not be enough to mask the album's blemishes." They singled out "The Prelude" ("One of the superior intros in Hov's catalog"), "Lost Ones" ("one of the more heartfelt and transparent tunes of his career"), "Do U Wanna Ride" ("an open letter to former street associate-turned-inmate Emory Jones, Jay Z shows glimpses of the greatness that set him apart"), "I Made It" ("Another brief moment of brilliance on Kingdom Come, which is dedicated to the accomplishment of his mama proud") and the last two songs, "Minority Report" (one of the more unsung compositions in Jay Z's career and a stellar example of his underrated social commentary") and "Beach Chair" (an intense sonic affair that finds Jay Z reflecting on his past, present, and future, and is among the best work found on his first post-retirement album) as highlights. He said "both of which see Hov venturing outside of his comfort zone with favorable results."
The song Minority Report received further notice from hip-hop fans and critics alike especially for its production and its message. Mitch Findlay from HNHH said: "While Kingdom Come as an album is oft-maligned, largely viewed as a mediocre comeback album, there are some gems to be found. The best of which is Minority Report, an elegiac reflection on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Jay is at his most somber, spitting poetry rich with images, lamenting the mistreatment from government and former Commander-In-Chief George Bush. The pattern of A-List producers continues with Dr. Dre at the boards, and Ne-yo closes off the track with a haunting, powerful refrain - “seems like we don’t even care”." The Spin staff also singled out the song as one of the high-lists on the album: "It’s not the best track to listen to on a purely aesthetic basis, with Jay rapping in a stilted flow over a plodding piano beat. But the song stands out for both its incisiveness and its honesty." and called it "one of his most interesting bits of rapping ever". Adam Aziz from Vibe Magazine considered the song as one Jay-Z’s most underrated songs and said: “The song contains some of Jay’s most meaningful bars, including one of the truest ever spoken on record at the onset of the song – “People was poor before the hurricane came…”“ At the 50th Annual Grammy Awards, "Kingdom Come" received a nomination for Best Rap Album; the award was won by Kanye West for his 2007 album "Graduation".
Commercial performance.
"Kingdom Come" debuted at number one on the US "Billboard" 200 chart, selling 680,000 copies in its first week, according to Nielsen Soundscan. This became Jay-Z's ninth US number one album and tied him with the Rolling Stones for the third most number-one albums in the US. In its second week, the album dropped to number six on the chart, selling an additional 140,000 copies. On December 14, 2006, the album certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of two million copies. As of August 2009, the album has sold 1,510,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

USS Shelton (DD-790)

USS "Shelton" (DD-790) was a of the United States Navy, the second Navy ship named for Ensign James A. Shelton (1916–1942), who was killed in the Battle of Midway.
Construction.
"Shelton" was laid down on 31 May 1945 by Todd Pacific Shipyards Inc., Seattle, Washington; launched on 8 March 1946; sponsored by Mrs. Loretta Shelton Miller; and commissioned on 21 June 1946.
United States Navy service.
"Shelton" began her shakedown cruise on 20 July and returned to Seattle for post-shakedown availability. She moved down the coast to San Diego, California, on 12 October, and on 9 November stood out of that port en route to the western Pacific for her first tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. While serving with that fleet, she visited ports in China, Korea, and Japan. The destroyer returned to the west coast on 22 June 1947 and conducted local operations in the San Diego area. The destroyer underwent overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, from January to April 1948. After moving to San Diego on 19 April, "Shelton" operated along the California coast until sailing for WestPac and the 7th Fleet on 1 September. The seven-month deployment ended on 24 April 1949 when she sailed back into San Diego.
In June "Shelton" participated in a Midshipman training cruise which took her to Balboa, C.Z., and terminated in San Francisco at the end of July. She was in drydock there during October and November and, following sea trials, returned to San Diego in January 1950.
Korean War.
"Shelton" sailed west again on 1 May 1950. When hostilities began in Korea, on 25 June, the destroyer was a unit of Task Force 77 (TF 77), the Striking Force of the 7th Fleet. She served on both coasts of Korea until returning to San Diego on 8 February 1951. After six months in the states, she was on her way back to the war zone in late August. As a fleet destroyer, she served with TF 72, 77, 95, 96, and 97.
"Shelton" also participated in special bombardment missions. With at Hŭngnam on 25 October, she was taken under fire by enemy shore batteries and sustained one near miss. She was assigned to the bombline with in December; and, for a week, they shelled rail lines, bridges, and other targets of opportunity. In January 1952, they bombarded the Songjin area.
Assigned to TG 95 the following month, "Shelton" aided in the defense of Yang Do when North Korean forces attempted to land on that island. The action lasted from 01:30 until 11:00 and resulted in the landings being repulsed with heavy losses. Still in the area on the 22d, the destroyer was taken under fire by five communist batteries on the mainland. She sustained four direct hits and approximately 50 near misses. Her losses were 12 casualties and a five-foot hole in the bow, but she silenced the batteries and remained on station for two more days before retiring to Sasebo, Japan for repairs. She then returned to the Korean coast.
"Shelton" returned to San Diego on 10 April where she began an upkeep period and then conducted local operations until 13 November. On that date, the destroyer sailed for her third tour of duty in the Far East during the Korean War. She arrived at Sasebo on 1 December 1952 for a three-day tender availability before joining TF 77. She operated with that task force for 40 days before entering Yokosuka, Japan, for an upkeep period. Ready for sea on 26 January 1953, the destroyer joined the Formosa Patrol. Her next assignment was in Wonsan Harbor for 40 days, after which she again joined TF 95. Her deployment ended on the west coast on 29 June 1953.
From 1953 to 1959, "Shelton" divided her time between deployments with the 7th Fleet and west coast operations. On her annual deployment in 1957, she rescued 120 passengers from a New Zealand merchant ship.
She was on the west coast in 1960 and, from July to June 1961, she underwent Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) conversion at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. "Shelton"'s home port was changed to Yokosuka, and she sailed from Long Beach on 6 January 1962 for that port from which she operated until early March 1964.
On 5 March, "Shelton" was ordered to Subic Bay where she was joined by the destroyers and , carrier , and oiler . All loaded to capacity with stores and consumable items and sailed, on 30 March, for the Indian Ocean on a six-week goodwill cruise. This was Operation Handclasp, designed to aid foreign countries in the supply of consumable goods. The squadron visited Madagascar, Kenya, and Saudi Arabia before presenting a firepower demonstration for the Shah of Iran on 4 May.
Vietnam War.
The squadron was in Yokosuka two weeks later; but the deteriorating situation in Vietnam brought "Shelton" sailing orders to the South China Sea; and, on 2 June, she began a 28-day stay in the Gulf of Tonkin. The destroyer sailed for the west coast on 18 July, via Pearl Harbor, and arrived at her new home port, San Diego, on 31 August 1964.
"Shelton" operated from there until 24 August 1965, when she sailed to join the 7th Fleet off Vietnam. The destroyer provided anti-submarine protection and pilot rescue operations for "Bon Homme Richard" as well as firing numerous gunfire support missions. She was detached from the 7th Fleet on 1 February 1966 and returned to her home port the last of the month. The remainder of the year was spent in local operations with the exception of a midshipman cruise to Hawaii in June.
"Shelton" stood out of San Diego on 4 January 1967 and sailed for another tour off Vietnam. During the six and one-half months of her deployment, she performed such duties as: plane guard and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) protection at Yankee Station; screening on Piraz Station; gunfire support off South Vietnam; and gunfire support off North Vietnam. She returned to San Diego on 18 June and resumed normal stateside operations. "Shelton" was deployed to Guam from 2 January 1968 to 9 April, where she conducted operations in support of Polaris missile tests.
"Shelton" was to return to Vietnam from 30 September 1968 to 2 May 1969; from 2 March to 3 September 1970; and from 6 April to 7 October 1971. She had six line periods during 1968–1969; four in 1970; and five in 1971.
After "Shelton" returned to San Diego in October, she spent almost nine months operating out of her home port until she was notified that her services were again needed in Vietnam. The destroyer departed on 13 June 1972 on what was to be her last deployment to the western Pacific. She was back on the gunline on 10 July for a 25-day period. On 4 August, she was taken under fire by a barrage of approximately 40 rounds from a nearby wooded section of beach. Her gun crews quickly responded and were credited with destroying one of the enemy gun emplacements. "Shelton" and
 were taken under fire on 19 October when they were on an intercept mission five miles north of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). In the following 30 minutes, both ships fired over 120 rounds in an attempt to demolish the enemy sites. Immediately after observing four secondary explosions, "Providence" reported cross-fire from the island of Hon Co. "Shelton" bombarded the island and silenced the battery.
On 5 December, "Shelton" joined Task Unit 77.1.1 (TU 77.1.1) for a raid on targets in the vicinity of Hon Me Island. A barrage of return fire was received before counter battery fire from "Shelton" and silenced the emplacements. Another raid near Hon Me, on 19 December, brought the heaviest hostile fire of the deployment: approximately 700 rounds, with many splashes only 50 yards from the ship. "Shelton" departed the Tonkin Gulf three days later and returned to San Diego on 13 January 1973 to prepare for decommissioning.
"Shelton" was struck from the Navy list on 31 March 1973 and sold to the Republic of China on 18 April 1973.
Republic of China Navy service.
The ship served in the Republic of China Navy as ROCS "Lai Yang", equipped with AAW capabilities and reclassified as DDG-920. She came under the Wu-Chin II modernization program in May 1980 and was mounted with a OTO Melara 76 mm gun in 1982.
She was decommissioned by Taiwan on 16 March 1999 and turned into an artificial reef in November 2002.
Awards.
"Shelton" received eight battle stars for service in the Korean War and eight for service in Vietnam.

Iggy Katona

Egnatius "Iggy" Katona (August 16, 1916 – December 4, 2003) was an American stock car racing driver from Willis, Michigan. He is most famous for his performance in the ARCA series in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, where he won six championships and 79 races, both of which stood as series records until Frank Kimmel surpassed both; first in 2005 for championships and then in 2013 for wins. Other ARCA records held by Katona include most starts (630), oldest race winner (57 years old, Daytona International Speedway, 1974) and most consecutive seasons with a win (19, from 1953–1971) 
Early career.
Katona started out racing motorcycles in local races in Michigan and Ohio at age 21, winning nearly every race he entered.
After a brief tour of duty in the Army during World War II, he turned to midget car racing. Building his own engines and chassis and with his two sons Ronnie and Jim as crew members, Katona found success on four wheels as well, including winning 14 feature races in a row at Detroit's famed Motor City Speedway dirt oval.
MARC/ARCA career.
In 1952, fellow Toledoan John Marcum created his Midwest Association for Race Cars as a Northern counterpart to the Southern stock car series of the day, Bill France, Sr.'s NASCAR. Katona was a force in the series from the beginning, finishing 3rd in the series' inaugural campaign in 1953, 2nd in 1954, and winning the championship in 1955, 1956, and 1957. His 4th MARC championship came in 1962 driving his #30 Ford.
Although he developed his racing skills on the short tracks of the Midwest, Katona adapted well when the MARC changed its name to ARCA and began racing on superspeedways in 1964, winning the ARCA race at Daytona three times. He won his 5th and 6th titles in 1966 and, at the age of 51, 1967. His consistency was his biggest asset, as he finished in the top ten in series points in 21 straight seasons from 1953–73.

Dave Roberts (third baseman)

David Wayne Roberts (born February 17, 1951) is an American former professional baseball third baseman and catcher, who played all or part of ten seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the San Diego Padres, Texas Rangers, Houston Astros, and Philadelphia Phillies, between and .
San Diego Padres.
1972: First overall pick.
Roberts attended Corvallis High School (Oregon) and played college baseball for the University of Oregon, where he was primarily a shortstop. After his junior year, he was made the number one overall pick in the 1972 Major League Baseball Draft by the Padres on June 6.
The following day, he signed with the Padres, and later that day made his major league debut, becoming the sixth player to go straight to the majors after being drafted without first playing in the minor leagues. He appeared in the second game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates, entering the game in the 12th inning at third base and going 0-for-3.
Roberts spent most of the remainder of the 1972 season as the Padres' regular third baseman. However, he was shifted to second base in mid-September following the promotion of Dave Hilton from the minors. Overall, he hit .244 with five home runs and 33 runs batted in.
Dave Roberts was playing 3rd base on July 18 when Steve Arlin came within one out of a no-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies until Denny Doyle bounced a single over Roberts head. Padres Manager Don Zimmer was playing his infield in to guard against the bunt.
1973: First Chance.
Roberts opened the 1973 season as the Padres' regular second baseman. After five games, in which he went 1-for-16, Roberts was sent to the bench. Over the next 17 games, Roberts played in eight, all as a pinch hitter. On May 1, with Roberts batting .083 and without an extra-base hit, he was demoted to the minor leagues, with Don Mason being recalled.
Playing with the Triple-A Hawaii Islanders, Roberts hit .375 in 22 games. Meanwhile, Hilton, who had started the year at third base, was batting .208. Hilton was returned to the minor leagues and replaced by Roberts, who was the regular third baseman the rest of the season. Roberts responded with what would be the best offensive season of his career, as he posted career highs in batting average (.286), home runs (21) and runs batted in (64) as well as several other categories.
1974: Breakdown.
Roberts remained the Padres' starter at third base in 1974, but struggled out of the gate. He batted just .194 in April without a homer. It got worse in May, as he batted .163. Although he finally hit his first home run of the year on May 13, he had just seven extra base hits and seven RBI through the first two months. On July 21, batting just .178 in 88 games, Roberts lost his starting job, as he was once again replaced by Dave Hilton. Things did not get any better, as Roberts batted .095 the rest of the way without an RBI to finish the season with a .167 average.
1975: The Ivie experiment.
In 1975, Roberts found himself starting the year back in the minor leagues in Hawaii. Veteran Glenn Beckert opened the year as the Padres' third baseman, but lasted just three games. Early on, the Padres decided to experiment by putting Mike Ivie—who himself had been the first overall pick by the Padres in the 1970 draft as a catcher—at third base. Although Ivie hit decently, his defense was poor, and he wound up splitting time with Ted Kubiak and Héctor Torres.
Meanwhile, Roberts was having a decent, but not spectacular, season with Hawaii, batting .262 with 12 homers and 71 RBI in 121 games. He was given another shot at the majors in late August, and once again he finished the year as the Padres regular third baseman, batting .283 in 33 games down the stretch.
1976: Back to Hawaii.
After the 1975 season, the Padres traded two pitchers to the Houston Astros for third baseman Doug Rader, who would be their full-time third baseman in 1976. Rather than keep him in the majors on the bench, the Padres sent Roberts back down to the minors, where—in a reversal of what they did with Ivie—he was converted to catcher. This time, Roberts did not return to the majors, as his offensive numbers in Hawaii slipped to a .249 average with 10 home runs and 53 RBI.
1977: Backup catcher.
Following the 1976 season, the Padres sold Roberts' contract to the expansion Toronto Blue Jays along with those of Dave Hilton and Héctor Torres. However, as the offseason went on, the Padres traded their starting catcher, Fred Kendall to the Cleveland Indians in a deal which brought them slugging outfielder George Hendrick. Owner Ray Kroc, determined to make a big splash, also signed ace reliever Rollie Fingers and catcher-first baseman Gene Tenace as free agents. With the team's bench now a bit thin, the Padres reacquired Roberts from the Blue Jays in exchange for reliever Jerry Johnson.
Roberts' return allowed the Padres to give Tenace more playing time at first base, where Ivie was still considered to be underachieving, without having to give significant playing time to third catcher Bob Davis. Roberts also played several games in the infield. In his first full major league season since 1974, Roberts batted .220 with just one home run in 80 games.
1978: Last chance in San Diego.
To start the 1978 season, Roberts was once again sent down to the minors. He had lost the job as Tenace's backup to rookie Rick Sweet, and with Davis seemingly entrenched as the third catcher, there was no place for him on the roster. However, things changed at the end of May, as the Padres had decided to move Tenace permanently to first base, bumping Gene Richards back to the outfield. The team sent Davis down to the minors and recalled Roberts, who was hitting .267 in 36 games, to back up Sweet.
Although Roberts played in 54 games, he had just 97 at bats, in which he batted just .216. He continued to expand his defensive flexibility, playing his first major league games in the outfield. However, the Padres finally decided to part ways with their second #1 overall pick, having traded Mike Ivie in February. Roberts was shipped off to the Texas Rangers along with outfielder Oscar Gamble. In return, the Padres acquired utility man and pinch hitter Kurt Bevacqua, first baseman Mike Hargrove, and Roberts' replacement as backup catcher, Bill Fahey.
Texas Rangers.
1979.
Roberts made the Rangers out of spring training as their third catcher and utilityman. With Jim Sundberg playing 150 games behind the plate and John Ellis also on the team, Roberts played every position on the field except shortstop and pitcher in 1979. Although his batting average finally came back to a respectable .262, he played in just 44 games, and wound up spending some time in Triple-A with the Tucson Toros, playing in nine games for them in August, all at second base.
1980.
In 1980, Roberts again served as the Rangers utilityman. This year, however, he saw more time on the field than he had since 1974, playing in 101 games. He played in 37 games at third base, 33 at shortstop, 22 at catcher, five in right field, and four each at first and second base for Texas, batting .238 and reaching double digits in homers (10) for the first time since 1973. After the season, he became a free agent himself for the first time in his career. On December 10, he signed a contract with the Houston Astros.
Houston Astros.
Although Roberts spent the entire 1981 season with the Astros, he played sparingly. He appeared in just 27 of the team's 110 games (the season was shortened due to a strike), although he still managed to play four positions. He batted .241 with one home run and five RBI in 54 at bats. The following year, Roberts was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies at the end of spring training for a minor league pitcher.
Philadelphia Phillies.
1982 with the Phillies looked a lot like 1981 with the Astros did for Roberts. If anything, he played even less due to a couple of stints on the disabled list. He played in 28 games, with just 6 hits in 33 at bats. He again started the 1983 season on the disabled list, and was released on May 17 without having played that year, ending his playing career.
After the majors.
After retiring as a player, Roberts briefly joined the managerial ranks. In 1984, he managed the Eugene Emeralds of the Northwest League, then a farm team of the Kansas City Royals. The team finished 19–55, by far the worst record in the league, and Roberts never managed again. He also served as first base coach for the Indians in 1987.
Roberts was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1994.

Miner's Delight, Wyoming

Hamilton City, or Miner's Delight as it was commonly known, was a town in Fremont County, Wyoming, United States, on the southeastern tip of the Wind River Range, that prospered during the mining boom in the American West in the second half of the 19th century. It was a "sister city" of Atlantic City and South Pass City. Today a few buildings still stand as a reminder of an era in Wyoming's past history.
Miner's Delight went through several boom-bust periods, as many western mining towns did, with corresponding rises and declines in its population. Gold was discovered there in 1868, and by 1870, at the height of the mine's operations, the population in Hamilton City was 75, forty of whom were miners. The original boom of mining activity "busted", however, from 1872 to 1874, but by the 1880s a new era of economic prosperity had dawned. Smaller booms occurred in 1907 and in 1910, and then again during the Great Depression. The town was inhabited as late as 1960. As of 2015, there were no residents in the town.
History.
Boom or bust, 1868–1910.
The Miners Delight mine, discovered by Jonathan Pugh, was located about a quarter mile west of the town then known as Hamilton City. Boom and bust periods followed, and in March 1882, the mine was completely shut down and not used again until after the turn of the 20th century. The two brief boom periods in 1907 and in 1910, were in relation to mining operations.
A famous incident involving Miner's Delight occurred there in March 1893, which was widely covered in the press at the time in Cheyenne and throughout Wyoming, and came to be known as "the brass lock service mystery". Miner's Delight postmaster, James "Jimmy" Kime had attempted to ship eight registered letters via the Rawlins and Northwestern's line's Lander-to-Rawlins stagecoach to the Postmaster in Rawlins using the "brass lock service". The Post Office's so-called "brass lock service" utilized canvas pouches, which were locked with brass locks, with the only persons having a key being the Postmasters along the stage line. When Kime's pouch reached its destination in Rawlins some 120 miles to the southeast, however, the postmaster there discovered that someone had cut the pouch and stolen all the registered letters.
For many months, U.S. Postal inspectors investigated the matter, and a number of other related thefts of various valuables on the line from the locked pouches, before finally arresting Postmaster John Gatlin of the Myersville Station near today's Jeffrey City, Wyoming, along with his wife Stella. The trials of the couple in Laramie City went on into the Fall of 1893, when charges against John Gatlin were finally dropped, after Stella Gatlin confessed to stealing the items, due to what she claimed to be her illness of kleptomania. Her affidavit stated that she had struggled for years to overcome the mania, while keeping it a secret from her husband. On November 25, 1893, the jury found Mrs. Gatlin guilty. Two days later, she was taken to the Laramie Prison, where she was registered as Prisoner #150, the first woman to be imprisoned there after being convicted of a federal crime in Wyoming. She was released early in December 1894, based on her "good conduct", and following her departure, prison officials added a special new wing exclusively for women, with individual cells and a toilet.
The Ghost Town of Miner's Delight today.
Today, through historic preservation by the Bureau of Land Management and various university programs and courses, the ghost town at Miner's Delight stands as a testament to the passage of time, and provides historians with a peek at early Wyoming life and the gold mining culture. On the townsite are seventeen structures, including: seven cabins, one saloon, one meat house, one shop or barn, one shaft house, one pantry, one cellar, three privies, and a corral. All of the buildings are constructed of logs or unfinished lumber.
Miner's Delight was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 4, 1980.
History of the town's name.
The town's nomenclature, and how it ended up being called "Miner's Delight" instead of "Hamilton City", is a topic of historical debate. There are generally two stories associated with the changing of the town's name. Both stories involve the discovery of a golden lode, a miner's delight, on the ridge above town.
The first story holds that in 1869, a man named William Jones, while chasing his cows about a pasture, stumbled across some quartz with gold flecks dotting it. The site was so remote and so far above town, that he erroneously assumed no one else would ever find it. Contented, he continued on his way, gathering his stray cattle. When he returned later to the site of the gold lode, however, he found others working the claim. He tried to relate his tale of the discovery to the other miners, but they would have none of it, and ran him off.
The other story does not have quite the same Old West flair as the tale of Jones' would-be discovery. A man named Johnathan Pugh, who incidentally is listed as one of the original founders of the lode, claimed to have discovered the gold. He even described the quartz ridge above town, down to the gold nuggets embedded in it.

Brampton Centennial Secondary School shooting

A school shooting occurred at Brampton Centennial Secondary School in Brampton, Ontario, Canada, on Wednesday, May 28, 1975, at 11:35 a.m. The school closed for the remainder of the week following the shooting, and re-opened the following Monday.
Shooting.
Michael Slobodian, a 16-year-old student at the school, had been cutting classes, and teacher Margaret Wright had called his parents to inform them of the issue. His mother confronted Slobodian about this during a mid-morning break, when Slobodian had gone home. Slobodian then wrote a note to his family, including "I am going to eliminate certain people from this world. Those people are: Mrs. Wright, Mr. Bronson and any other sucker who gets in my way. I am then going to kill myself so as not to be imprisoned."
Slobodian returned to school with two rifles in a guitar case. He began by firing at three boys in a washroom, killing fellow student John Slinger and wounding the other two. He then entered the hallway and continued shooting, wounding several students. He proceeded to an art classroom, killed Wright and wounded two more students. He returned to the hallway and killed himself, adjacent to the art classroom. In addition to the three dead (including himself), Slobodian had wounded 13 others.
Witnesses of the shooting included students Cathy and Nancy Davis, the daughters of then Ontario Premier William Davis. Another witness was Scott Thompson, of the Kids in the Hall, who was in the same English class with Slobodian that was taught by Wright. Thompson has stated that the 24-year-old Wright, who was six months pregnant, had been his favourite teacher and the first person to encourage his writing talents.

4-17 Southern Speedway

The 4-17 Southern Speedway is an asphalt, 3/8th mile racetrack located in Punta Gorda, Florida, United States. The track was built in 1990 by LeRoy Davidson who operated it until 1995. It started off its life playing host to Super Late Models, late models, sprint cars, sportsmen, open wheeled modified, FASTRUCK, FASTKIDS, and several other types of racing. It sported one of the largest fields of late models in the South. The track was featured several times on the cover of Circle Track Magazine as one of the top circle tracks in the South Eastern United States.
History.
Glen VanHorn took over the track in 1995 until LeRoy Davidson returned to operate the track in 2002. The wrath of Hurricane Charley in 2004 took its toll on the track, but was rebuilt and reopened in 2005. Bobby Diehl took over the track for the 2007 season. Some improvements were made and many more were planned but never came to light. In 2010 the track changed owners again when Mike Chase and Kevin Williams took over the lease.
In January 2013 the track fell into turmoil when its tenant at the time, Kevin Williams could not come to an agreement with the Punta Gorda Airport on a new lease. They wanted to rise the price of the lease because the airport receives grants from the FAA and in order to get them airport property must be leased at a fair market value. When Williams lease ended and moved out he removed the grandstands and other equipment that he said he brought in but in doing so did some damage to the track.
In June 2013 the airport agreed to a new lease with Jamie Haase, to take over the track. The track was renamed Three Palms Speedway, and was to reopen August 30, 2014. The track featured Young Guns 4's, Outlaw 4's, Bombers4. Street Stocks5, Thunder Trucks6, TQ Midgets, 3PS Sprint Cars and Dwarf Cars weekly. Florida United Promoters Series Super Late Models, Pro Trucks, Sportsman, Open Wheel Modifieds, Legends Cars and Tampa Bay Area Racing Association Winged Sprint Cars also visited the track.
Current state.
In September 2015 the Charlotte County Airport Authority evicted the Haase family as the track promoters, citing "empty promises" and considerable unpaid debt, leaving the track idle. On Thursday, August 18, 2016, new owners Joe and Janet Gentry took over the speedway and began cleaning up weeds around the track after weeks of negotiations with the Charlotte County Airport Authority. Major renovations took place after the Gentry's obtained their lease. The speedway has re-opened and held its first race since the reopening in January 2017. In 2022, Smuggler's Enterprises submitted a proposal to demolish the racetrack and build a new entertainment venue, but the company later rescinded the proposal, and the speedway's lease transferred to the next-in-line bidder MotoBros in 2023, which intends to continue operations.

Seven Species

The Seven Species (, ) are seven agricultural products—two grains and five fruits—that are listed in the Hebrew Bible as being special products of the Land of Israel.
The seven species listed are wheat, barley, grape, fig, pomegranates, olive (oil), and date (date honey) (). Their first fruits were the only acceptable offerings in the Temple.
History.
The Seven Species have played an important role in the food of the Israelites in the Land of Israel and the religious traditions of Judaism.
Many references to these basic foods can be found in the Bible. The Mishna states that only first fruits of the Seven Species could be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem as offerings. Wheat fields, vineyards and olive groves are still a salient feature of the Israeli landscape today. Figs, olives, pomegranates and dates are common ingredients in the cuisine of Israel.
Wheat.
The ancient Israelites cultivated both wheat and barley. These two grains are mentioned first in the biblical list of the Seven Species of the land of Israel and their importance as food in ancient Israelite cuisine is also seen in the celebration of the barley harvest at the festival of Passover and of the wheat harvest at the festival of Shavuot.
Barley.
A hardy cereal that has coarse bristles coming from the ears. It is widely cultivated, mainly for use in brewing and stockfeed.
Grapes.
Grapes were used mainly for the production of wine, although they were also eaten fresh and dried.
Figs.
Figs were cultivated throughout the Land of Israel and fresh or dried figs were part of the daily diet. A common way of preparing dried figs was to chop them and press them into a cake. Figs are frequently mentioned in the Bible (for example, , and ).
Pomegranates.
Pomegranates were usually eaten fresh, although occasionally they were used to make juice or wine, or sun-dried for use when the fresh fruit was out of season. They probably played a minor part in Israelite cuisine, but were symbolically important, as adornments on the hem of the robe of the high priest and the Temple pillars, and embossed on coinage.
Olives.
The olive was a major element in the seven species. Olive oil was used not only for food and for cooking, but also for lighting, sacrificial offerings, ointment, and anointment for priestly or royal office.
Dates.
Dates were eaten fresh or dried, but were used mostly boiled into a thick, long-lasting syrup called "date honey" ("dvash temarim") for use as a sweetener. The honey in the Biblical reference of "a land flowing with milk and honey" (for example, ) is date honey.
While in Jewish law dates are under the category of the seven species, bee honey may have been the type of honey that is referred to in the Torah. (Probably not, though, as all of the classical commentaries on the Torah say that it specifically refers to honey from dates. Also, in a list of agricultural produce, honey from an animal source would be completely out of place.) By the time the Talmud was written honey bees were extinct in Israel, and dates were used in place of honey, the excavation of Tel Rehov shows that beekeeping was practiced in Israel in the early Iron Age 3,000 years ago during the time of king David.
Several accounts in Torah also indicate that bee honey existed in ancient Israel; in the Book of Judges Samson takes honey from a bee hive that he finds in the carcass of a lion (, see also Samson's riddle).
As a reference for measurements.
The size of various measurements are tied to the specific amounts and sizes of Halachic objects. For example, the minimum width of Tefillin straps is known by law given to Moses at Sinai to be the size of a grain of barley. Alike, other fruits are used for measuring. Talmud scholars use the verse of Seven Species as a hint for all the measures using fruit sizes.
Modern significance.
The seven species are traditionally eaten on "Tu Bishvat", the Jewish "New Year for Trees"; on "Sukkot", the "Festival of Booths"; and on "Shavuot", the "Festival of Weeks". In "halakha" (Jewish law), they are considered more important than other fruits, and a special "berakhah" (blessing) is recited after eating them. Additionally, the blessing prior to eating them precedes those of other food items, except for bread.
The seven species are all important ingredients in Israeli cuisine today.
Deuteronomy 8:8 is prominently inscribed (in the Latin Vulgate translation: ) on the dome of California Tower at Balboa Park in San Diego, California, referring to the species' importance in California agriculture.

Sporting CP (handball)

Sporting Clube de Portugal (), otherwise referred to as Sporting CP is a professional handball team based in Lisbon, Portugal since 1932 and plays in top tier Andebol 1. The club is one of the most decorated handball clubs in Portugal, having won 47 national titles, 16 Regional titles and 2 International titles.
History.
Handball was introduced in Sporting Clube de Portugal in 1932, under the influence of Salazar Carreira, who introduced the sport to the club. It was on 10 April that a Sporting Portugal team played its first game in the sport, then in the eleven-a-side variant, the only one practised at the time, with the team beating Centro de Armas 1-0. The first official match would take place a month later against the same opponent, on 15 May 1932.
Indoor handball, which later became known as seven-a-side handball, was approved by the International Handball Federation in 1937, but the first demonstration of this variant in Portugal only took place on 12 September 1949 at the Cascais skating rink, when a Sporting team faced and beat another from Dramático de Cascais by 25-5, setting the tone for what would become one of the most emblematic sports in Portugal: Evaristo Ribeiro; Artur Mira and Rui Lanceiro; Fernando Nunes; Pereira de Sousa; Domingos Vicente and Joaquim Chagas, with Pinto dos Santos deputising.
Officially, Sporting started seven-a-side handball in the 1950-51 season and the sport immediately took root in the club, winning the first national championship in Portugal the following season. Initially, the seven-a-side handball season began in the summer after the 11-a-side competitions had finished, which was justified by the fact that the players were practically the same.
Sporting dominated Portuguese handball, particularly in the sixties and seventies and even in the eighties, with emphasis on the period from 1966 to 1973, in which seven National Championships were won in eight possible, five of which were consecutive, with a mythical team that became known as "Os Sete Magníficos" (The Magnificent Seven).
In 1995, Sporting fans were forced to choose the modalities to keep in the club, due to financial problems, having chosen handball and futsal, leading to the closure of the basketball, rink hockey and volleyball sections (which in the meantime would be reactivated).
Sporting CP completed the 2023-24 league season undefeated in its 22 home and away matches and completed its first domestic triple. They completed a second domestic triple in the 2025 season surpassing their northern rivals for domestic titles won. They also achieved its highest EHF Champions League 2024-25 placing, by reaching the quarter finals.
Facilities.
Pavilhão João Rocha.
Pavilhão João Rocha is a multi-sports pavilion located in the parish of Lumiar, in Lisbon. Located next to the Estádio José Alvalade, it is the home of Sporting CP indoor sports. In honor of one of the most distinguished figures in the history of Sporting, the pavilion was named after former club president, João Rocha, who remained in office from September 1973 to October 1986.

Rice (band)

Rice (styled as rice) are a Japanese visual kei rock band formed by ex-Raphael members Yuki and Hiro. Like Raphael, a lot of rice's music is in the rock genre although instead of guitar the cello is a much more prominent instrument in their work.
The band, although not as visual as they used to be in Raphael, still keep a very distinct fashion from that of a lot of other bands.
Band members.
Yuki Sakurai: Lead vocalist, main lyricist, main composer and bass guitarist (occasionally).
Kazuhiro "Hiro" Murata: Backing vocalist, percussionist, drummer
Although technically not members of the band, many session instrumentalists have contributed both to album recordings and live shows including Hiroshi Egami (guitar), Fumiaki Nishiyama (bass), Toshihiko Nagayama (cello) and Ayumi Hashimoto (cello).
Something that is common on a lot of Rice releases is the inclusion of the same song, "Air", on a number of releases. "Air" is a song with no lyrics; it consists of a vocal melody, a cello melody and a percussion accompaniment. It appears on every album and single they have released, re-recorded each time, with the exception of "はるか" (Haruka), "刑事ヒロンボ" (Keizi Hironbo) and "There is…".
In October 2012, Rice announced that they will be going on an indefinite hiatus. They will be performing their last show before their hiatus at the Akasaka Blitz on December 25. They resumed activities in late 2013, however, and released their comeback single, "僕はここに居る" (Boku wa Koko ni Iru), that December.

Whoop-Up Days

Whoop-Up Days is an annual 5-day exhibition and rodeo held in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada organized by the Lethbridge &amp; District Exhibition. 
Held during the last full week of August, the event includes a parade through downtown, daily concerts, bull riding, a rodeo, an indoor and outdoor trade show, live-music, a midway, and citywide pancake breakfasts and barbecues. 
In 2023, a record-breaking attendance at the event numbered 77,263. The previous record was set in 2007 when 69,964 visitors attended. Economic impact from the fair amounts to roughly $2.5 million spent by event operations, locals and visitors.
History.
The first fair was held on 5 October 1897 at the agricultural grounds in Queen Victoria Park (renamed in 1955 to Gyro Park). It included stage presentations, travelling shows and horse racing.
In 1904, eight years before the Calgary Stampede, the first large-scale rodeo was staged as part of Whoop-Up Days.
In 1912, the festival was moved to its current location on the Exhibition grounds east of Henderson Park.
There were cancellations in 1917–18 &amp; 1942–45. A virtual event was held in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Location.
Whoop-Up Days takes place at Exhibition Park, which is on the eastern edge of the city next to Henderson Park. Permanent structures at the site include a 10,664 m2 (114,787 ft²) pavilion complex (main, north, west and south pavilions, and Saddle Room), Heritage Hall, Pioneer Park, a grandstand, and a racetrack.
Name.
The name “Whoop-Up Days” is derived from the nearby national historic site Fort Whoop-Up, which was a whisky trading outpost and hub of illicit activities in the mid-19th century before the arrival of the North-West Mounted Police in the area that is now Lethbridge.

Thomas Meagher (merchant)

Thomas Meagher ( – 26 January 1837) was an Irish merchant and tailor who arrived in Newfoundland around 1780 as an apprentice to a clothier surnamed Crotty. After Mr Crotty's death, Meagher married his widow, Mary Crotty, and took over the Crotty business.
By 1808 Meagher had bought the "Mary", which he replaced the following year with the "Triton"; in the fall of 1809 he shipped more than 1,350 quintals of cod and other products to Waterford. On the return voyage the "Triton "carried provisions and 62 migrants. His trading routes expanded to include other ports in North America. Demand for fish such as cod in southern Europe was growing and profits from the passenger and supply trades were considerable.
Meagher had sent his eldest son Thomas to Ireland to establish a branch of his business in Waterford. The younger Thomas married Alicia Quan, daughter of Alicia Forristall and Thomas Quan, of Wyse, Cashen and Quan, one of the largest trading companies in Waterford, at her parents' residence. Their most famous child, Thomas Francis Meagher, one of five siblings, was born on 23 August 1823.
Meagher's business in St. John's had suffered a major setback when the premises were wiped out in the Great Fire of 1817. The firm was rebuilt but never recovered from the loss which in 1820 declared insolvency and was dissolved on 31 August 1820.

Pop Snyder

Charles N. "Pop" Snyder (October 6, 1854 – October 29, 1924) was an American catcher, manager, and umpire in Major League Baseball.
Biography.
His 18-season playing career began in 1873 for the Washington Blue Legs of the National Association, and ended with the 1891 Washington Statesmen. He led his league in several defensive categories during his career, including putouts by a catcher three times, assists by a catcher three times, double plays by a catcher three times, and fielding percentage by a catcher three times.
He became a player-manager in 1882, when the Cincinnati Red Stockings of the American Association, formed. His team won the American Association pennant that first season, his second as a player; he was a member of the National League champion Boston Red Caps team. He was the manager for the Red Stockings, now known as the Reds, for the first two seasons of the Red Stockings existence, and part of third when he replaced Will White despite a 4427 mark after 71 games. In 1891, at the age of 36, he played and managed his last season, this time when the Washington Statesmen entered the National League.
During his playing and managerial career, he would perform duties as an umpire when the need arose, but it wasn't until 1890, in the Players' League, that he began to see significant time in that capacity. It was after his career as a player and manager that began a full-time career as an umpire. This lasted intermittently from 1892 to 1901. In total he umpired 390 games in four different leagues; the National Association, the American Association, the Players' League, and the National League. Snyder died in his hometown of Washington, D.C. at the age of 70, and is interred at Glenwood Cemetery in D.C. He also holds the all-time major league record with 763 passed balls.

Olympus E-400

The Olympus E-400 is a digital single-lens reflex camera launched by Olympus on 14 September 2006, using the Four Thirds System lens mount standard. This 10 megapixel camera could be compared to other DSLRs unveiled during the summer of 2006 with comparable pixel count and price range: the Sony α 100, the Nikon D80, the Canon EOS 400D and the Pentax K10D.
Features.
The E-400 is notable for its small size, omitting the hand grip and exploiting the smaller sensor. It weighs only 375g and approaches manual focus film SLRs sizes, reminiscent of the Olympus OM system. It was accompanied by two new small zoom lenses, a 14–42 mm (28–84 mm 135 film format equivalent) f/3.5–5.6 standard zoom weighing 190g and a 40–150 mm (80–300 mm equivalent) f/4.0–5.6 long zoom weighing 220g. The body and single lens kit have a 700GB£ MSRP and 850GB£ for the two lens kit.
The E-400, like all of the Olympus E-system cameras, uses Olympus' patented Supersonic Wave Filter dust reduction system to shake dust from the sensor during startup and when requested by the user; this largely eliminates the problem of dust accumulation on the surface of the image sensor.
The E-400 was controversial because Olympus only marketed it in Europe. The rest of the world had to wait for the E-410, which did not arrive until the spring of 2007 and did not include the same Kodak sensor as the E-400. The E-410 replaced the Kodak sensor with the Panasonic sensor. Some claim the Kodak sensor produced smoother gradations and a higher quality image at lower ISO numbers.

The International Jew

The International Jew is a four-volume set of antisemitic booklets or pamphlets originally published and distributed in the early 1920s by the Dearborn Publishing Company, an outlet owned by Henry Ford, the American industrialist and automobile manufacturer.
The booklets were a collection of articles originally serialized in Ford's "Dearborn Independent" newspaper, beginning with "The International Jew: The World's Problem," published on May 22, 1920.
Background.
At the beginning of 1920, Ford's personal newspaper, "The Dearborn Independent", was languishing in subscriptions and losing money. Ford and his personal secretary, Ernest G. Liebold, began to discuss a series of articles on the Jewish question. While it was Liebold who claimed to have come up with the title "The International Jew", he turned to "the walking dictionary" William J. Cameron for most of the writing. For 91 issues, the weekly paper announced a variety of stories featuring the supposed evilness of Jewish influence. 
Editor E. G. Pipp left the "Independent" in April 1920 in disgust with the planned antisemitic articles, which began in May; he was replaced by Cameron. While Ford did not personally write the articles, he expressed his opinions verbally to Cameron and Liebold. Cameron had the main responsibility for expanding these opinions into article form. Liebold was responsible for collecting more material to support the articles.
The most popular and aggressive stories were then chosen to be reprinted into four volumes called "The International Jew". The first volume was published in November 1920 as an anthology of articles that had been published in the "Independent" from May 22 to October 2, 1920. The original print run of the first edition was estimated to be between 200,000 and 500,000 copies. Three additional volumes were published over the next 18 months.
Liebold never copyrighted "The International Jew" and therefore had no control over anyone else publishing it themselves. The book was ultimately translated into 16 languages, including six editions in Germany between 1920 and 1922, and has remained in the public domain.
Libel suit.
Following the publishing of an article in the "Independent" that alleged Jewish control of New York banks that were holding Texas cotton farmers hostage financially, San Francisco lawyer and Jewish farm cooperative organizer Aaron Sapiro sued Ford and Dearborn Publishing for libel in a $1 million lawsuit.
During the trial, William J. Cameron, the editor of Ford's "Own Page", testified that Ford had nothing to do with the editorials even though they were under his byline. Cameron testified at the libel trial that he never discussed the content of the pages nor sent them to Ford for his approval. Investigative journalist Max Wallace doubted the veracity of this claim and wrote that James M. Miller, a former "Dearborn Independent" employee, swore under oath that Ford had told him he intended to expose Sapiro.
According to political scientist Michael Barkun, "That Cameron would have continued to publish such controversial material without Ford's explicit instructions seemed unthinkable to those who knew both men. Mrs. Stanley Ruddiman, a Ford family intimate, remarked that 'I don't think Mr. Cameron ever wrote anything for publication without Mr. Ford's approval.
Ultimately, the libel suit led Ford to issue a retraction and public apology in which he indicated having been unaware of the nature of the remarks, both those published in the "Independent", and the subsequent pamphlets, and was "shocked" by the content. 
Soon after the trial, Ford closed the "Independent" on December 31, 1927.
Influence on Nazi anti-Semitism.
Ford's "International Jew" was translated into German in 1922 and cited as an influence by Baldur von Schirach, one of the Nazi leaders, who stated "I read it and became anti-Semitic. In those days this book made such a deep impression on my friends and myself because we saw in Henry Ford the representative of success, also the exponent of a progressive social policy. In the poverty-stricken and wretched Germany of the time, youth looked toward America, and apart from the great benefactor, Herbert Hoover, it was Henry Ford who to us represented America."
Praising American leadership in eugenics in his book , Adolf Hitler considered Ford an inspiration, and noted this admiration in his book, calling him "a single great man". Hitler was also known to keep copies of "The International Jew", as well as a large portrait of Ford in his Munich office.
Content.
After publication in the "Independent", the articles were compiled as chapters into a four volume set as follows:
Volume 1: "The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem" (1920)
Volume 2: "Jewish Activities in the United States" (1921)
Volume 3: "Jewish Influence in American Life" (1921)
Volume 4: "Aspects of Jewish Power in the United States" (1922)
Abridged version in 1949.
In June 1949, a 174-page, one-volume abridgement of the text appeared, titled "The International Jew", subtitled "The World's Foremost Problem", edited by George F. Green, who was editor of the "Independent Nationalist", a British fascist publication. The book was sold in the United States by the Christian Nationalist Crusade.

Taboo (drink)

Taboo is a fruit-flavoured spirit made in the UK. Its main ingredients are vodka, white wine and peach and tropical fruit juices. Its alcohol content is 14.9% (29.8 proof).
Taboo was first put out on the market in 1988 by drinks company First Drink. However, after an initial honeymoon period for the product up until the early 1990s, the company spent very little money on promoting it; in 2005 only £8,000 was spent. In 2006 First Drink hired 23red to boost Taboo's profile.
Originally the drink was marketed with a companion spirit called Mirage, with advertising showing both products.

Association of American Editorial Cartoonists

The Association of American Editorial Cartoonists (AAEC) is a professional association concerned with promoting the interests of staff, freelance and student editorial cartoonists in the United States, Canada and Mexico. With nearly 200 members, it is the world's largest organization of political cartoonists.
The AAEC has filed friend-of-the-court briefs in several cases dealing with freedom of the press, including the 1988 Supreme Court case "Flynt v. Falwell" (Hustler Magazine v. Falwell). Aside from First Amendment issues, the Association does not take sides in political controversies.
Formed in 1957 by a small group of newspaper cartoonists led by John Stampone of the "Army Times", the AAEC was created to promote and stimulate public interest in the editorial page cartoon and to create closer contact among political cartoonists. Each year, the annual AAEC convention is held in a different North American city, allowing cartoonists and other association members—including publishers, writers, historians and collectors—the chance to meet face-to-face, talk shop, and generally kvetch.
Publications and programs.
The AAEC follows the publishing industry and member artists through news updates at its web site EditorialCartoonists.com, and in its annual magazine, the "Notebook." The AAEC site also offers dozens of new editorial cartoons each day.
The AAEC also sponsors a Cartoons for the Classroom program designed to aid educators at all levels in teaching history, economics, social studies and current events.
History.
In 2007, the AAEC met over the 4th of July weekend in Washington D.C. to celebrate its 50th anniversary.
In 2008, AAEC joined over 60 other art licensing businesses (including the Artists Rights Society, Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, the Stock Artists Alliance, Illustrator's Partnership of America and the Advertising Photographers of America, among others) in opposing both The Orphan Works Act of 2008 and The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008. Known collectively as "Artists United Against the U.S. Orphan Works Acts," the diverse organizations joined forces to oppose the bills, which the groups believe "permits, and even encourages, wide-scale infringements while depriving creators of protections currently available under the Copyright Act."
In 2022, in response to the Pulitzer Prize committee replacing the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning with the revamped category the Pulitzer Prize for Illustrated Reporting and Commentary, the AAEC "issued a statement calling for the Pulitzer board to reinstate Editorial Cartooning as its own category while also recognizing Illustrated Reporting as a separate form." They wrote:
Awards.
The AAEC sponsors two awards for cartoonists: the John Locher Memorial Award, given each year to the most promising young cartoonist, age 17-25. The Award was named in honor of the late son of Dick and Mary Locher, who felt the need to establish an award that would not only honor the memory of John Locher but also would help discover young cartoonists and stimulate interest in editorial cartooning among college-age students in North America.
In 2017, the AAEC launched the Rex Babin Memorial Award for Excellence in Local Cartooning, named in honor of the late "Sacramento Bee" cartoonist, who died of cancer in 2012. As the cartoonist for daily newspapers in two state capitals, Rex Babin saw how effective satire could sometimes be when directed at targets across the street, and often lamented that such work was overlooked by the big industry awards.

O. P. Caylor

Oliver Hazard Perry "O. P." Caylor (December 14, 1849 – October 19, 1897) was an American newspaper columnist, manager in professional baseball, and catalyst in the formation of the franchise that is now the Cincinnati Reds.
Biography.
Caylor was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1849; he was named after Oliver Hazard Perry, an American naval commander. After earning a law degree in Dayton, he worked as a baseball newspaper columnist for "The Cincinnati Enquirer" and the "Cincinnati Commercial". He also joined the front office of an early Cincinnati Reds franchise of the National League, and worked as an official scorer. After that Cincinnati franchise was expelled from the National League, Caylor became one of the principal figures in the founding of the American Association during the 1881–82 offseason. The 1882 Cincinnati Red Stockings, competing in the inaugural year of the American Association, was the first season of the modern day Cincinnati Reds franchise.
Caylor's first stint as a manager in the major leagues was for the Red Stockings, succeeding the original manager, Pop Snyder. In his debut season, the team finished in second place with a record of 63–49. The following year, the team finished with a 65–73 losing record and in fifth place. Caylor resigned after that season, due in large part to his combative nature that put him at odds with the press and new club ownership.
Caylor moved to Philadelphia where he began writing for the "Sporting Life". The New York Metropolitans, also of the American Association, then hired him as their manager on June 11, 1887, with Caylor inheriting a team with a 9–28 record. The team was 35–60 under Caylor, with a season record of 44–89 resulting in a seventh-place finish. He was fired in the off-season by new owner Charlie Byrne. Caylor's overall record as a manager was 163–182 for a .472 winning percentage.
Caylor moved to Carthage, Missouri, where he proceeded to start "The Daily Democrat" newspaper. In 1890, he returned to New York City after being hired by Albert Spalding to be the editor for the "New York Sporting Times".
Caylor died in Winona, Minnesota, at age 47 from the effects of tuberculosis. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx. He was survived by his wife and a daughter.

His most recent book, "Blessed Are the Organized: Grassroots Democracy in America" (2010), takes an ethnographic turn, investigating the engaged democratic practices that he has endorsed in his previous work.
He has received Princeton University’s Graduate Mentoring Award (2009) and the President’s Award for Distinguished Teaching (2010). He plans to retire in July 2018.
He has also delivered Gifford Lectures in May 2017, with the title "Religion Unbound: Ideals and Powers from Cicero to King", and plans to expand the materials into a book.
Theory.
He has championed what he calls "the moral tradition of democracy" as a "background of agreement" shared by participants in the political/social debates taking place in America today. This is his answer to such thinkers as Alasdair MacIntyre and Stanley Hauerwas who believe that participants in such debates do not share enough common ground to prevent their arguments from being intractable. Stout has been influenced by Richard Rorty and more recently Robert Brandom and, albeit with qualifications, aligns himself with the school of philosophy known as American pragmatism.

Twin Falls Idaho (film)

Twin Falls Idaho is a 1999 independent drama directed by Michael Polish, who co-wrote and co-stars in the film with Mark Polish. It premiered at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival and was acquired by Sony Pictures Classics, who gave the film a limited release on July 30, 1999.
Plot.
The film portrays the lives of shy conjoined twins Blake and Francis Falls, who take residence in a rundown hotel to hopefully reunite with their estranged birth mother. They find their gateway to the outside world through an eccentric young prostitute named Penny. They agree to attend a Halloween party with Penny and pretend to be wearing a "Siamese Twins" costume.
The rest of the movie involves the brothers dealing with Francis's health problems, the changing relationship between the brothers, and Blake's budding relationship with Penny. Ultimately, Francis's health deteriorates too far and the twins have to be separated. Francis is too sick to survive and dies, but Blake survives and must begin a life apart from his twin. Penny visits him and the two start a relationship.
Reception.
The film has an 80% "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 45 critics’ reviews. 
Critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, writing "It is one of those films not much interested in plot, but is fascinated by what it is like to be somebody, or two somebodies. The movie doesn't depend on special effects to create a shared body..and instead uses the performances." He added, "We can imagine [the brothers’] lifetime of isolation from the normal things people do", and concluded "In its quiet, dark, claustrophobic way, this is one of the best films of the year."
Janet Maslin of "The New York Times" said, "It's a film that dwells as hauntingly on loneliness as it does on never actually being able to be alone", and that Mark Polish gives an "especially affecting performance.”
Accolades.
At the 1999 Deauville American Film Festival, "Twin Falls Idaho" was honored with the CinéLive Award, the Fun Radio Trophy, and the Jury Special Prize (tied with Sarah Polley’s "Guinevere"). It also won the Audience Award at the Athens International Film Festival and was nominated for an Open Palm Award at the Gotham Awards. The film received a Special Recognition notice from the National Board of Review for excellence in filmmaking.

FC Porto (handball)

Futebol Clube do Porto (), commonly referred to as FC Porto or simply Porto, is a Portuguese professional handball team based in Porto. Created in 1932, it is the senior representative side of the handball section of sports club FC Porto. 
The team competes domestically in the top-tier league Andebol 1 and internationally in European Handball Federation club competitions, such as the EHF Champions League and the EHF European League. Home matches are played at the Dragão Arena, alongside the men's basketball and roller hockey, and women's volleyball teams. The current head coach is former Swedish international Magnus Andersson, who returned to the club after a one-season break, having held the job from 2018 to 2023.
History.
The section started in 1932 with a field handball (eleven-a-side) team, which played competitive matches until 1974–75, when it was discontinued in favour of seven-a-side handball. During this period, the club won 37 regional and 29 national league titles in the field handball discipline.
In 1951, the club established the handball section whose team won the Portuguese league title for the first time in 1953–54, and increased that tally with eight further titles by 1968. Porto then endured a 31-year drought before winning the national league title again in 1998–99. In the 2014–15 season, the team secured their seventh consecutive league title, establishing a national record. In the previous season, the team also debuted in the EHF Champions League group stage, after overcoming the qualification tournament for the first time in five consecutive attempts.
Honours.
Porto is the second most decorated Portuguese club in domestic competitions, with a total of 44 titles.

Rhapsody (musical group)

Rhapsody was an Australian female duo that consisted of Kymberlie Harrison and Cathy Ford. They had a minor hit (No. 95 on the ARIA singles chart) in the early 1990s called "Cowboy Lover" on BMG Records.
After the promoter and record label owner Gene Pierson's success with the soap opera actor Melissa Tkautz, who had a No. 1 hit in 1991 as Melissa, he came up with the concept for Rhapsody. He styled the two models and helped them create the song that gave them success.
"Cowboy Lover" was originally a slow reggae song, but was remixed into a dance track by Filthy Lucre, famous for their 1991 dance remixes of Yothu Yindi's "Treaty".
Prior to Rhapsody, Kymberlie Harrison was a producer for Melissa's hits "Read My Lips" and "(Sexy) Is the Word", written by Roy Lachlan Nicolson.
At the height of their popularity the duo posed in "Playboy Australia" magazine, making the cover of the August 1993 edition.

The subdivisions of Croatia on the first level are the 20 counties ("županija", pl. "županije") and one city-county ("grad", "city").
On the second level these are municipalities ("općina", pl. "općine") and cities ("grad", pl. "gradovi"). Both of these types of subdivisions encompass one or multiple settlements ("naselje", pl. "naselja") which are not public or legal entities, the Croatian Bureau of Statistics consider them as non-administrative units – human settlements, similar to the United States census designated places. As parts of the cities or the (larger) municipalities they may form city districts ("gradski kotari" or "gradske četvrti") or local committee areas ("mjesni odbori"). Small municipalities usually consist of only one settlement.

Gold-filled jewelry

Gold-filled is a type of composite material. Composites are formed from two or more constituent materials with different properties that, when combined, create a new material with enhanced properties. Gold-filled material is made by bonding a layer of gold alloy to a base metal core (typically brass, but sometimes copper or silver). This creates a material with the appearance and durability of solid gold, but at a lower cost. 
Gold-filled material is used to create a variety of products, including:
Regulations and Standards
In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates the term "gold-filled" to protect consumers. According to FTC regulations, gold-filled jewelry must contain a minimum of 5% gold by weight. This ensures a significant layer of gold that is much thicker than standard gold plating. 
Reputable manufacturers and sellers in the US adhere to these FTC regulations, ensuring consistent quality and consumer protection.
Markings and Abbreviations
The related terms "rolled gold plate" and "gold overlay" may legally be used in some contexts if the layer of 14k gold constitutes no less than 5% weight of the item. In the jewelry industry, gold-filled is never abbreviated as "GF" or "gold GF" on product markings. This abbreviation is incompatible with FTC guidelines, which require clear labeling of the gold content and fineness (e.g., 1/20 14K GF).
Most high quality gold-filled pieces have the same appearance as high carat gold, and gold-filled items, even with daily wear, can last 10 to 30 years though the layer of gold will eventually wear off exposing the metal underneath. The layer of gold on gold-filled items is 5 to 10 times thicker than that produced by regular gold plating, and 15 to 25 times thicker than that produced by gold electroplate (sometimes stamped HGE for "high grade electroplate" or HGP for "heavy gold plate", though neither of these terms have any legal meaning, and indicate only that the item is gold plated).
Definition.
In the United States, the quality of gold-filled composite is defined by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). If the gold layer is 10kt fineness, the minimum weight of the plated layer on an item stamped gold-filled marks according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) must equal at least of the total weight of the item. If the gold layer is 12 kt or higher, the minimum layer of karat gold in an item stamped gold-filled marks must equal at least the total weight of the item. The most common stamps found on gold-filled jewelry are 12kt GF and 14kt GF. Also common is 10kt. These standards are for modern gold-filled items. It is not uncommon to see 14kt gold-filled marks, plus many other variations, on items from the 1930s, 1940s, etc., which would have to be marked "Rolled Gold Plate".
The Federal Trade Commission allows the use of the terms "rolled gold plate," "R.G.P" or "gold overlay" on items with lower thicknesses of gold than are required for "gold-filled." An example would be an item stamped as " 10kt RGP" meaning that the object is plated with 10kt gold at a thickness that makes weight of the plated layer equal to one-fortieth of the weight of the metal parts of the object.
"Double clad" gold-filled sheet is produced with the thickness of gold on each side. One-twentieth 14Kt double clad gold-filled has a layer on each side of 14Kt making the total content of gold . The thinner layer on each side does not wear as well as single clad gold-filled.

S.L. Benfica (handball)

Sport Lisboa e Benfica (), commonly known as Benfica, is a professional handball team based in Lisbon, Portugal.
Benfica play in the top tier domestic league, Andebol 1, and hold home matches at the Pavilhão da Luz Nº 2. Since its inception in 1932, Benfica have won 7 Portuguese League titles, 6 Portuguese Cups, 2 Portuguese League Cups, and 7 Portuguese Super Cups. Internationally, Benfica won the EHF European League in 2021–22, becoming the first Portuguese club to win the competition.
In addition to the club's men's reserve team, Benfica B, playing in the second division, Benfica also has a women's team, who are the current Portuguese champions, having won 11 League titles, 9 Cups, 1 Federation Cup and 4 Super Cups.
History.
Beginning.
Founded on 8 May 1932, Benfica's handball section endured a troubled start shortly after being founded. It was inactive from 1939 to 1942–43 because of a conflict between Benfica and the Portuguese Handball Federation. Until the 1960s, handball was played by eleven players, and after 1962–63, in another dispute with the federation, Benfica closed the eleven players team and opted for the current team handball.
The handball section did not achieve success until 1961–62, being overshadowed by the football, cycling, basketball and roller hockey sections of the club during that time.
Golden years.
After a period of dominance by crosstown rivals Sporting CP, Benfica experienced great success in the 1980s and early 1990s, when was led by coach Eugene Troffin, and later by Ângelo Pintado, along with players such as Paulo Bunze, Swedish international Fredrik Appelgren, Dogărescu, Covaciu and Drăgăniță, goalkeeper João Santa Bárbara, wingman Mário Gentil, Vasco Vasconcelos, Luís Lopes and Rui Ferreira; Benfica won four national championships, three Portuguese Cup and two Portuguese Super Cup.
Decay.
In the 1997–98 season, club president João Vale e Azevedo decided to shut down the section. It was restarted in the next season, but from the Regional Championship, four divisions away from the top flight.
Rebuilding years.
In 2005, after years in anonymity, Benfica hired former ABC Braga coach Aleksander Donner on a three-year deal.
Because of a dispute between Liga and the Handball Federation, which managed the Divisão de Elite, there were two simultaneous championships. In the 2005–06 season, Benfica played in the Divisão de Elite. In 2006–07, Benfica joined the Liga Portuguesa de Andebol along with Sporting CP. During that season, Benfica won their first title since 1994, the League Cup. In the following season, Benfica finally achieved their first league title since 1990. Despite the success, Aleksander Donner did not renew his contract at the end of the season.
Recent years.
To replace Donner, Benfica hired José António Silva, who won three titles in three years: the 2008–09 League Cup, 2010–11 Portuguese Cup and 2010 Super Cup. In the 2010–11 season, Benfica reached the final of the EHF Challenge Cup, but lost to Slovene side RK Cimos Koper. In 2011–12, José António Silva was replaced by another former ABC Braga coach, Jorge Rito. With him, Benfica finished fourth in league for the first time. On 2 September 2012, Jorge Rito won Benfica's fourth Super Cup trophy. The season ended with only a second place in the league. In 2013–14, Benfica's performances worsened, and the team finished the league in fourth place. Jorge Rito did not renew his contract and was replaced by Mariano Ortega. On 3 April 2016, Benfica, who had beaten rivals FC Porto in the semi-finals the day before, beat Lisbon rivals Sporting in the final and conquered their fifth Portuguese Cup, ending a four-year trophy drought.

It celebrated fifty years of existence in 2006, and operates as a not-for-profit organization. It is noteworthy for performing the rarely staged Rossini's "William Tell" (1986) and Ponchielli's "I Lituani" (1981, 1983 and 1991), and also for contributing experienced chorus singers to the Lyric Opera of Chicago.
The opera "Jūratė and Kastytis" by Kazimieras Viktoras Banaitis was presented in Chicago, Illinois in 1996.
Lithuanians operas were sometimes held at Maria High School in Chicago and such operas are now sometimes held at Morton East High School in Cicero, Illinois.

Captive helicopter

A captive helicopter is a helicopter which is tethered to the ground with a rope, as with a captive balloon. Captive helicopters can be used for the same purposes as captive balloons. 
A primary advantage of captive helicopters is that they can be more accurately steered than captive balloons or kites in order to compensate for the influence of the wind. A further advantage is that, unlike kites, they can be launched in the absence of wind. Their main disadvantages are that they require power for their flight and are very noisy. 
Unlike kites (which rely solely on the wind for power) and balloons (which require specialty lighter-than-air gases), helicopters are normally powered by aviation fuels. However, it is possible to run captive helicopters electrically by running a cable inside the tether line holding the helicopter.
In 1887, Parisian electrical engineer Gustave Trouvé demonstrated his tethered electric model helicopter at a meeting of the French Association for the Advancement of Sciences in Toulouse. At the end of the 1930s, the German company Telefunken tried to make a longwave transmission experiment with a captive helicopter driven with a three-phase, AC-power engine. The helicopter should have reached a height of 1000 metres. Because of electrostatic charges induced by earth's electric field, the fuses melted when the captive helicopter reached a height of 750 metres and the captive helicopter landed roughly.

Solomon Metcalf Allen

Solomon Metcalf Allen (18 February 1789 – 23 September 1817) was a professor of languages at Middlebury College. He was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and studied at Andover Theological Seminary from 1813 to 1814. The rest of his career was spent at Middlebury College: tutoring from 1814 to 1816; Professor elect of Languages, 1816–1817. While attempting to repair a chimney on the roof of Painter Hall, he fell eight to ten feet down to the roof, then about forty feet to the ground. Allen succumbed to his injuries before 10:00pm that evening. He was later highly eulogized in Carlos Wilcox's "Remains" (1828).

Branded content

Branded content (also known as branded entertainment) is a type of entertainment product made or otherwise funded by an advertiser. They are designed to build awareness for a particular brand by presenting content that reflects its values and image, without necessarily being presented as a promotion first and foremost. Branded content is distinguished from product placement—a business practice in which advertisers pay to have references to their brands incorporated into a work (although branded content may still otherwise contain product placement), and content marketing—the use of content to specifically promote a product, service, or company.
Unlike conventional forms of editorial content, branded content is generally funded entirely by a brand or corporation rather than a studio or a group of solely artistic producers. Branded content has taken the form of television programming, films, internet video and other digital content, video games, events, and other installations. Modern branded marketing strategies are intended primarily to counter market trends, such as the decreasing acceptance of commercials and advertorials.
History.
Early examples.
The concept of branded content dates back to the early era of broadcasting; many early radio and television programs were controlled by their sponsors and branded with their names, including the "Colgate Comedy Hour", "Hallmark Hall of Fame", and "Westinghouse Studio One". Typically, the sponsor coordinated the entire production of the program, with the broadcaster only providing studios and airtime. These programs featured advertising segments for the sponsor's products, typically featuring the brand's spokesperson and demonstrations of new products. Notable spokespeople often became celebrities in their own right, such as Betty Furness, a B-movie actress whose fame was elevated after becoming a spokesperson for Westinghouse appliances on "Studio One" (Furness would later work as a consumer affairs reporter for WNBC-TV in New York City).
Many melodramatic serial dramas targeting women, such as "As the World Turns", were produced by the consumer goods company Procter &amp; Gamble; this prompted the genre as a whole to be dubbed a "soap opera". The Revlon cosmetics company gained significant prominence after sponsoring the quiz show "The $64,000 Question"—which was, for a time, the most-watched program on U.S. television. In 1956, the Ford Motor Company's new marque Edsel sponsored a CBS variety special, "The Edsel Show", which starred Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Bob Hope. The special was a critical success and widely viewed, but its success did not transfer to Edsel itself, which was a high-profile commercial failure. By request of Crosby, the special was credited as a production of his alma mater Gonzaga University, with its revenues helping to fund the construction of a new campus library. 
In the late 1950s, the quiz show scandals exposed that several major television game shows had been manipulated, or outright rigged under demand of their sponsors, in order to maintain viewer interest and ratings. "Dotto" and "Twenty One" were at the center of the scandal, with both shows having been accused of presenting staged matches with pre-determined outcomes as if they were genuine. Testimony by a producer of "The $64,000 Question" revealed that Revlon founder Charles Revson had personally exerted control over the program in order to favor specific contestants, but did not go as far as to rig the show. The aftermath of the scandals, as well as increasing production costs due to factors such as the rollout of color television, prompted networks to begin asserting creative control over the production and scheduling of their programming. Broadcasters also phased out of the "single sponsor" model, in favor of having sponsors purchase blocks of time during breaks in a program to run commercials instead.
Conventional product placement and cross-promotion still appeared in films and television, but it was often argued that overuse of placements can distract from the entertainment value of the work. The film "Mac and Me" was widely criticized for containing extensive placements of Coca-Cola and McDonald's as major plot elements (going as far as crediting the chain's mascot Ronald McDonald as appearing in the film "as himself"). "Hallmark Hall of Fame" still occasionally aired on broadcast TV until 2014, when it was announced that the franchise would move to Hallmark's co-owned cable channel Hallmark Channel in the future.
Modern examples.
After releasing its hockey-themed film "The Mighty Ducks", Disney established a National Hockey League expansion team known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, which was named in reference to the film. Disney subsequently produced two "Mighty Ducks" film sequels, and an animated series inspired by the team set and in a fictional version of Anaheim. The films and cartoon series also featured cameos by Mighty Ducks players. These works were designed to increase awareness of the Mighty Ducks as a brand, and create synergies with Disney's core entertainment businesses. The NHL felt that the "Mighty Ducks" cartoon could help to promote the game of hockey among a younger audience, and counter the stereotype of hockey being associated with Canada and the U.S. Northeast. The team's merchandise, which was sold at Disney Parks and Disney Store locations in addition to the NHL's main retail channels, was the best-selling among all teams for a period.
In 2001, automaker BMW began a marketing campaign entitled "The Hire", in which it produced a series of short films that prominently featured its vehicles, staffed by prominent directors (such as Guy Ritchie) and talent. The films were advertised through television, print, and online marketing which directed viewers to a BMW Films website, where they could stream the films, and access ancillary information such as information about their featured vehicles. BMW also distributed the films on DVD with "Vanity Fair" magazine to increase their distribution among the company's target audience. By the end of the campaign in 2005, the eight-film series had amassed over 100 million views, and several of the films had received both advertising-related and short film awards.
In 2010, Procter &amp; Gamble and Walmart began to fund a series of made for TV films, distributed through the former's Procter &amp; Gamble Productions division, such as "The Jensen Project" and "Secrets of the Mountain". They were all targeted towards family viewing, aired primarily on NBC as time-buys, and featured product placement for P&amp;G brands and Walmart's store brand Great Value. In turn, Walmart erected promotional displays of P&amp;G products related to each film, and sold the films on DVD immediately after their broadcast. Both companies used exclusive advertising time during the films to promote their products. P&amp;G reported that the favorability of the products featured in "Secrets of the Mountain" increased by 26% among mothers who saw the film. "Advertising Age" felt that despite lukewarm reception and viewership, "as case studies for successful branded entertainment, they've become the holy grail of how networks and marketers can use entertainment to achieve scalable audiences, measurable product sales and active fan communities."
The Canadian beer brand Kokanee (owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev) partnered with its agency Grip and Alliance Films to produce "The Movie Out Here", a feature-length comedy film set in the brand's home province of British Columbia. The film was released in April 2013, after being featured at the 2012 Whistler Film Festival. Kokanee beer, along with characters from its past advertising campaigns, make appearances in the film, and an accompanying campaign allowed bars in Western Canada to compete to be a filming location, and users to vote on the film's soundtrack and have a chance to be listed as a "fan" in the credits. Grip's creative director Randy Stein stated that viewers had become more accepting of branded content, and that there would be a larger focus on the emotional aspects of Kokanee as a brand as opposed to the number of placements. In 2018, Pepsi similarly backed the comedy film "Uncle Drew"—a feature comedy adapted from a character from a Pepsi Max ad campaign.
The energy drink company Red Bull has relied heavily on branded content as part of its marketing strategies. The company operates several Media House studios, which coordinate the production and distribution of original content targeted towards the interests of young adults—particularly music and extreme sports. Alongside digital media content such as online video (via platforms such as Red Bull TV), and print media such as "The Red Bulletin", Red Bull has also organized events and sports competitions which carry its name, such as the Red Bull Air Race World Championship, Crashed Ice, and Flugtag competitions, music festivals and events, and a skydive from the Earth's stratosphere by Felix Baumgartner. These ventures are consistent with the company's image, bolster Red Bull as being a lifestyle brand in these categories, and build awareness of Red Bull without necessarily promoting the product itself. An executive for Red Bull Media House North America remarked that the growth of digital media platforms had made it easier for brands to produce and distribute their own content, and stressed that branded content was most effective when it is "authentic" and high-quality.
In 2019, the housing rentals service Airbnb premiered a self-produced documentary—"Gay Chorus Deep South"—at the Tribeca Film Festival, which documented a 2017 tour of the Southeastern United States by the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus. The company's head of creative James Goode stated that the film was consistent with the company's values of "telling stories of belonging and acceptance", and its involvement and support in the LGBT community. Goode did not consider the film to be branded content, stating that it was an effort to "support the chorus and make the highest-quality piece of content we could."
Some branded content efforts have not been as successful. The association football (soccer) sanctioning body FIFA budgeted the 2014 film "United Passions," a dramatization of the organization's history. The film was released to negative reviews, focusing primarily on its poor writing and self-serving nature, and with many considering it one of the worst films of all time. The film's North American release also coincided with the indictment of FIFA officials by U.S. federal prosecutors under charges of corruption, leading critics to point out the irony in its depiction of FIFA president Sepp Blatter. The film only took in $918 in the U.S. box office, making it the worst-grossing film of all-time.
Research and issues.
In 2003, the Branded Content Marketing Association was formed in order to promote branded content to a wider, international audience. In January 2008, the BCMA conducted a study intending to analyze the efficacy of branded content compared to traditional advertising. Reportedly, over one-third of people were skeptical about traditional ads, and only one-tenth trusted the companies producing such adverts. The study concluded that "in the overwhelming majority of cases consumers preferred the more innovative approach compared with traditional advertising". Over 95% of the time, web sites that feature branded content were more successful than web sites featuring typical advertisements, and are 24% more effective at increasing the purchase intent of viewers. Branded content is most effective in the 18-34 age group, who tend to react with more positive opinions and being overall more responsive to branded sites. Online Publishers Association’s President Pam Horan concluded, “In nearly every category measured, ad effectiveness scores on branded content sites were numerically higher than on the web in general, on portals or on ad networks.
These positive results, however, having come from an organization which endeavors to promote the marketing practice, are subject to criticisms of bias.
Award community.
Webby and Lovie awards among other had recognized Branded Content as a category in prior instances, but most officially began to grow to include branded content in 2012, when "Branded Content/Entertainment" became a category at EuroBest, Dubai Lynx Spikes Asia and Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.

Vincent Alo

Vincent "Jimmy Blue Eyes" Alo (May 26, 1904 – March 9, 2001) was a New York mobster and a high-ranking capo in the Genovese crime family who set up casino operations with mob associate Meyer Lansky in Florida and Cuba.
Early years.
Born in Harlem, Alo started working on Wall Street at age 14. As a young man, Alo was convicted of armed robbery and sent to either Sing Sing or Dannemora state prison.
In 1926, Alo became a made man, or full member, of Joseph "Joe the Boss" Masseria's powerful New York gang. Named a caporegime of the old Joe Adonis crew, Alo oversaw clubs, speakeasys, and illegal gambling in Brooklyn.
Partnership with Lansky.
In 1929, Lucky Luciano, one of Masseria's lieutenants, introduced Alo to Meyer Lansky. An old friend of Luciano's, Lansky was a valuable money-maker for Masseria's organization and Luciano wanted Alo to guard him. Luciano may have wanted Alo to also monitor Lansky (a claim reinforced in Vincent Teresa's "My Life In the Mafia" and "The Last Mafioso" by Ovid Demaris). However, the majority of crime historians view this as unlikely, as Lansky was at this time the head of a gang independent of Masseria and Luciano called the Bugs and Meyer mob, which made much of their income through extortion and was one of the most violent gangs of the era. Alo is described as a junior partner in Lansky's operations in virtually all sources, if mentioned at all. Both Lansky and Alo were introverted, bookish men who wanted to become legitimate businessmen. The two mobsters quickly became friends.
When Alo first met Lansky, Alo was involved in a setting up a casino in the town of Hallandale, Florida (now called Hallandale Beach). Immediately realizing that Alo would be perfect for this venture, Meyer invited him to become a partner. When Lansky and Alo arrived in Florida, they immediately started making contributions to local fraternal organizations and secret payments to politicians and law enforcement.
When they opened their first casino in Hallandale, Alo and Lansky faced no government or public opposition. Business was so good in the first casino that Alo and Lansky soon opened a second one in Hallandale. This cooperative relationship between the town and the mob would continue uninterrupted until 1947. As the town's economy became more diversified, public embarrassment about the illegal gambling increased. At that point, Alo and Lansky closed their two Hallandale casinos and started planning for casinos in Cuba.
Later years.
In 1970, Alo was convicted of obstructing justice. Robert M. Morgenthau, U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District of New York, stated that "Alo is one of the most significant organized crime figures in the United States. He is closely associated with Meyer Lansky of Miami, who is at the apex of organized crime." Alo was described as being charming, intelligent and well liked by his associates. He retired in the mid 1970s and his crew was taken over by Matthew Ianniello.
On March 9, 2001, Alo died of natural causes in Florida at age 96. His remains were interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.
In popular culture.
The character Johnny Ola, portrayed by Dominic Chianese, in the film "The Godfather Part II" (1974) is based on Alo. The character Victor Tellegio, portrayed by Robert De Niro in the film "American Hustle" (2013) is based on Alo, as well.
He also provided the full story of Prohibition-era bootlegging to Drew Struzan's wife Dylan, who published it as the 2019 nonfiction narrative book "A Bloody Business".
He is mentioned early in the 2019 Martin Scorsese film "The Irishman" by Frank Sheeran, also played by De Niro.
Alo is a key figure in the 2025 gangster pulp fiction styled novella series, "The Payola Chronicles - How the Mafia &amp; the CIA Created Rock &amp; Roll", by Justin Stamm. It is a fictional series based on real events and characters from the world of the mafia, as sourced from Diana Stamm's conversations and interviews with her real life Godfather, Mafia Boss Vincent "Jimmy Blue Eyes" Alo, as well as many other contributors, as indicated in the Preface and Acknowledgments sections of the book . As a Hollywood producer, her relationship with Alo began in 1989, after being introduced to him by his Associate, Tommy Sobeck, who later became her partner on the project. In 1991, she enlisted her friend, Dylan Struzan, as a writer for hire, to attempt to write the book about his life. Later, Struzan departed from Stamm's employment and produced an unauthorized book on the subject. Struzan was never given the full story of Alo's life. In addition, Diana has retained the sole rights to Jimmy Alo's life story since 1989. "The Payola Chronicles", documents the entire history of Stamm's relationship with the Jimmy Alo story and it's development as a media project.

74th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade

The 74th Guards Motor Rifle Zvenigorod-Berlin Orders of Kutuzov and Suvorov Brigade (; MUN 21005) is a military formation of the Russian Ground Forces's 41st Combined Arms Army, part of the Central Military District, stationed in Yurga, Kemerovo Oblast, Russia. The brigade was created by reforming the 94th Guards Motor Rifle Division withdrawn from the GDR in the early 1990s.
History.
Early years and WWII.
The 74th Motor Rifle Brigade was created from the disbanded 94th Guards Zvenigorod-Berlin Order of Suvorov Motor Rifle Division, formerly called the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. The 94th Guards Rifle Division was formed on 23 April 1943 in the eastern Ukraine as a consolidation of the 14th Guards and 96th Rifle Brigades. It took part in the liberation of southern Ukraine through the remainder of 1943 and into 1944 as part of the 5th Shock Army. It remained with the Army through the remainder of the war and ended in the streets of Berlin. Post-war, it remained with the 5th Shock Army for a period, then transferred to the 3rd Army. 
In 1957, it was one of the few Rifle Divisions to be reorganized into a Motor Rifle Division and still retained its original number. In the mid-1980s, it was transferred to the 2nd Guards Tank Army, where it remained until withdrawn from East Germany in 1991.
After arriving in Yurga (near Tomsk) in the Siberian Military District, it was reorganized into the 74th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, where it remains today. Other units also became part of the 74th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade including a guards engineering battalion and the 386th Tank Regiment.
After the Collapse of the Soviet Union (1993–2015).
Between 30 December 1994 and April 1995, the brigade's personnel carried out a combat missions in the First Chechen War. On the night of December 31, 1994 to January 1, 1995, a brigade of 1,274 soldiers, 45 tanks, 115 BMP-1s entered Grozny, and in addition, the brigade's fighters captured the villages of Ilyinovskaya and Petropavlovskaya. In total, 128 servicemen of the 74th Brigade were killed during the conflict, and more than 700 people from there were awarded government awards. The brigade then returned to Chechnya in 1999-2001 as part of the counter-terrorist operation during the Second Chechen War.
On February 3, 2005, Russian defense minister Sergei Ivanov visited the brigade and promised that by the end of 2006, the brigade would be composed fully of professional soldiers, not conscripts. He also said the brigade was one of the most combat ready of the entire Russian military, adding a promise of new barracks construction.
By 2005, the commander was Major General Farid Balaliyev. Elements of the brigade have also participated in the Russian military intervention on the Syrian Civil War. In 2014, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu presented the brigade with the Order of Kutuzov for the successful completion of combat training missions. In 2015, the 74th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade became the first unit of the Central Military District to be fully re-equipped with T-72B3 tanks.
Invasion of Ukraine (2022–present).
The brigade is also involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A platoon of the 74th Motor Rifle Brigade surrendered to Ukrainian forces near Chernihiv. On 24 February, Ukrainian commander-in-chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi announced that a reconnaissance platoon of the Russian 74th Motorized Rifle Brigade had surrendered near Chernihiv, with the unit's commander claiming "nobody thought that we were going to kill". A member of the brigade was accused by Ukrainian prosecutors of detaining a civilian in the village of on 6 March.
On 8 March, the brigade conducted a river crossing of the Desna River in Chernihiv Oblast without setback. Elements of the brigade were among the units that attempted to cross the Siverskyi Donets River, near Bilohorivka, between May 8th and 10th; reportedly losing over 485 out of 550 men and 80 vehicles, and perhaps up to 1,000 to 1,500 of 2,000, and 100 vehicles. 
The Institute for the Study of War noted that despite their previous successful river crossing, the brigade's commanders may have underestimated improved Ukrainian artillery capability or may have been unable to control troop movements during the crossing.
Units in 1989–1990.

<doc id="6996762" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6996762" title="Obec">
Obec

 (, ; plural ) is the Czech and Slovak word for a municipality (in the Czech Republic, in Slovakia and abroad). The literal meaning of the word is "commune" or "community". It is the smallest administrative unit that is governed by elected representatives. Cities and towns are also municipalities.
Definition.
The legal definition (according to the Czech code of law with similar definition in the Slovak code of law) is: "The municipality is a basic territorial self-governing community of citizens; it forms a territorial unit, which is defined by the boundary of the municipality."
Every municipality is composed of one or more cadastral areas. Every municipality is also composed of one or more municipal parts (), which are usually town quarters or villages. A municipality can have its own flag and coat of arms.
Czech Republic.
Almost the entire area of the Czech Republic is divided into municipalities, with the only exception being military training areas. The smaller municipalities consist only of one village. A municipality usually has the same name as its most populated settlement, which usually contains the municipal office. However there are several exceptions, for example municipalities created by mergers of formerly separate municipalities (such as Brandýs nad Labem-Stará Boleslav or Orlické Podhůří).
A municipality can obtain the title of a city (), town () or market town (). While all of these are municipalities from the point of view of the law, they are usually referred to by their titles and not as municipalities. Municipalities without any other status are just called municipalities. Statutory cities can have self-governing subdivisions, so-called city parts or city districts (), which are somewhat similar to municipalities in that they have their own town halls and local government. Town and market town are above all ceremonial labels bestowed on municipalities with notable population, history and regional significance.
A special type of municipality is the capital Prague, which has simultaneously the status of a municipality and a region, and which is treated by special law.
The law makes it possible for municipalities which were stripped of town status during the Communist period to retain that status automatically. For any other municipality to gain town status, it must have population over 3,000 and must pass an assessment by the chairman of the parliament. For market town status, population is not a condition. The newest Czech town is Chýně, which obtained the status in 2023.
Some municipalities have extended competencies of delegated state administration for the territory of the municipality and for surrounding municipalities.
Statistics.
The smallest municipalities by area are Závist (0.42 km2) and Strukov (0.53 km2). The biggest are the cities of Prague (496.21 km2), Brno (230.18 km2) and Ostrava (214.23 km2), and the town of Ralsko (170.23 km2, including a former military area, with only about 2,000 inhabitants).
Slovakia.
As of 2020, there are 2,890 municipalities in Slovakia, with 141 of them being a city or a town.

Mickey's 60th Birthday

Mickey's 60th Birthday is an American live-action/animated television special broadcast on "The Magical World of Disney" on November 13, 1988 on NBC. As the title suggests, it was produced for the 60th anniversary of the Mickey Mouse character. Like "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" (which had been recently released at the time), much of the footage featured in the film is live-action with newly made animation (although some of the animation used for some scenes was made from existing footage) provided by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson. It was rebroadcast on Disney Channel Europe on November 18, 2008 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the special, as well as Mickey's 80th birthday.
As an NBC spectacular, the special features the cast of several contemporary NBC television shows, including "Family Ties", "Cheers", "Hunter", "L.A. Law" and "The Cosby Show".
Plot.
"Mickey Mouse's 60th Birthday" special is being taped and as his appearance in the show draws to a close, Mickey finds himself trying to decide how he should present himself to his audience. Rummaging through an old trunk, he finds the magic hat from "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" segment of "Fantasia" and considers using it, but he is warned by a sorcerer who owns the hat (who is not Yen Sid) that he should not be using other people's magic when he has his own, which Mickey initially does not understand. With that in mind, Mickey goes out on stage along with his birthday cake, provided by Roger Rabbit, who realizes that he placed a stick of dynamite on the cake instead of a candle. In his attempt to put the dynamite out, Roger ends up destroying the set, which prompts Mickey to use the magic from the hat to repair the damage. The audience screams for more and Mickey agrees to do so, but when he does, he suddenly vanishes.
The sorcerer, annoyed that Mickey disobeyed his warning and also seeing that he did not understand what he meant, decides to teach the Mouse how to find his own kind of magic, by casting a spell on him in which anyone he runs into fails to recognize him as Mickey Mouse; the spell can only be broken once Mickey finds his own magic. The Mouse is then returned to the real world, where he is found by Andy Keaton of "Family Ties", who mistakenly believes him to be a good impression of the real thing. Andy shows Mickey off to Mallory and Jennifer, but when they are not convinced, and even Andy turns him down, to Mickey's dismay. He later goes to the bar from "Cheers", only to realize he has no money to buy himself a drink. He then sings the "Happy Birthday" song to Rebecca Howe, cheering her up so much that she takes him out to dinner and a movie.
Meanwhile, The Walt Disney Company has organized a search party, led by Sergeant Rick Hunter (from "Hunter") to find the missing Mickey, which was reported on a local news show. In the process, anchorpersons Dudley Goode and Mia Loud begin to suspect Donald Duck after being told of how upset he was that he was not going to appear in Mickey's special. Their suspicions go even further when they find old footage in Donald's trash of Donald doing his own version of "The Mickey Mouse Club" theme song, and Donald is soon arrested after he tries (unsuccessfully) to testify his innocence (he claimed that the kidnapper was either Minnie Mouse, "the guy who framed Roger Rabbit", the Wicked Witch or Porky Pig). Donald is to be represented by the legal firm of McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak. As they continue with their reports on the search, the reporters show various clip montages of Mickey and various tributes.
As the special nears its end, Mickey returns to Disneyland, where a custodian mopes over the fact that he cannot see any point in his profession if the guest of honor is not going to show up for his own birthday party. A fellow custodian then sings a song called "It's Magic" to cheer him up, with Mickey accompanying the ensuing song-and-dance number. At this point, the sorcerer reappears and congratulates Mickey now that he has finally found his own magic inside him and thus breaks the spell. Just as the sorcerer exits, Roger rushes up to Mickey and instantly recognizes him. The news of Roger having "found" Mickey is brought to the news and the innocent Donald is released from jail just in time to join Mickey's birthday celebration. Soon, a parade appears, taking Mickey to Sleeping Beauty Castle, where Minnie is. People in the parade throw him up to the balcony of Sleeping Beauty Castle where Minnie is standing. Finally, Mickey and Minnie are reunited.
Also making cameo appearances are several reporters for NBC stations, including Allison Rosati of WGRZ-TV and Sue Simmons of WNBC-TV.

The Maid of Artois

The Maid of Artois is an opera by Michael William Balfe, written in 1836 to a libretto by Alfred Bunn, manager of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in London, who based his work on Eugène Scribe's stage version of Abbé Prévost's novel "Manon Lescaut".
Overview.
The opera opened on 27 May 1836, starring Maria Malibran as the title character, Isoline. The story concerns a girl in love, who is poached by a rich Marquis. The lovers seem destined to end their days in the wastes of the desert, until an unexpected rescue comes. The opera received good notices, and the overture was much admired.
Balfe's music shows the influence of his earlier training in Italy, especially of Bellini and Donizetti, as well as the French works that Balfe had sung (as a baritone) at the Paris Opéra, where he and Malibran had appeared together. Balfe wrote "The Maid of Artois" partly as a vehicle for her. Malibran was a mezzo-soprano with a three octave range. She had died in September 1836 before the score was printed, and so Balfe decided to set brighter, higher versions of the coloratura and other music in her role that are more typical of operatic treatments of a youthful character such as Isoline.

Sripurusha

Sripurusha (also known by titles such as Muttarasa, Rajakesari, Bhimakopa, and Ranabhajana) was a powerful king of the Western Ganga Dynasty king who ruled from 726 – 788 CE. According to the Javali inscription Sripurusha ruled for 62 years. He had marital relations with the Badami Chalukyas. and An able warrior and a scholar, he authored the Sanskrit work "Gajasastra". He is known to have undertaken significant irrigation projects such as the construction of a dam ("Katta"). and He is also celebrated for both military achievements and Jain patronage.
Politics of the South.
The rule of Sripurusha Muttarasa seems to have been filled with conflicts with the Pallavas of Kanchi, Pandyas, later the Rashtrakutas who overthrew the Vatapi Chalukyas. In 731 CE he defeated Pallava King Nandivarman II and assumed the title "Permanadi"His capital was shifted to "Manne" (Manyapura) near Nelamangala, now identified as a Ganga stronghold. He had good relations with Chalukyas and had helped them fight the Pallavas during the rule of Vikramaditya II and later he fought the Pandyas during the rule of Chalukya Kirtivarman II but suffered reversal at Venbai. When the Rashtrakutas rose to power, though betrayed by the Nolambas, Sripurusha had many victories against Krishna I and occupied some Ratta territories. This resistance to Rashtrakutas continued for some time before the Gangas normalised their relationship with martial alliances.
Religion and Patronage.
Sripurusha continued the Ganga legacy of Jain support. Charters from his reign document land grants for monasteries such as the "Lokatilaka Jinalaya" and "Kongeśvara caityālaya", and record ritual activities like Nandisvaram and Sripanchami that endured across centuries.
Literature and Legacy.
Sripurusha was a scholar-king who authored the Sanskrit treatise "Gajasastra", focused on elephant management. His reign cemented a dynastic tradition combining martial power, cultural advancement, and religious pluralism. The Doddahundi nishidhi inscription, raised by his son Satyavakya, immortalizes a Jain ritual site honoring his dynasty’s religious identity.

DYBN

DYBN (92.3 FM) is a radio station owned by Quest Broadcasting Inc. and operated under an airtime lease agreement by Y2H Broadcasting Network, Inc. The station currently airs as a simulcast of DYIO 101.1 MHz. Both station share studio and transmitter facilities at the BSP Camp, Capitol Hills, Brgy. Lahug, Cebu City.
History.
The station first signed on the air on April 19, 1992 as Killerbee 92.3. It carried a Top 40 format with the tagline "Music Mix is Simply Better". On April 26, 2013, Killerbee 92.3 officially signed off. This station, along with the other Killerbee stations, were relaunched under the Magic moniker (adopted from its parent station) by April 29, 2013. On December 27, 2024, Magic 92.3 quietly signed off for the last time and went off the air for a month.
On January 22, 2025, the station returned on-air under Y2H Broadcasting Network, a broadcast company of the Uy family. Y2H already had presence in Cebu by operating nearby station DYAP 88.3 MHz (owned by Southern Broadcasting Network) via airtime lease, and became the local outlet of the XFM Network. It temporarily carried the name Uy FM until March 17, when it was dropped and started carrying the tagline "Something Hot, Something Red" as part of its transition.
On May 18, 2025, Y2H consolidated the station's operations with CHR/Top 40 station Y101, which already entered into separate airtime lease and sales agreements with Y2H since 2024. Upon consolidation, Y101 vacated its long-time Gaisano Mall facilities and began utilizing 92.3 FM's studio and transmitter site. As a result, 92.3 FM became a simulcast of Y101's programming, with this station identifying as "RedHotX92" (a nod to Y101's long-time branding) to reflect the change.

Logan Coalfield

The Logan Coalfield is a coalfield located in Logan County and Wyoming County of southern West Virginia, in the Appalachia region of the eastern United States.
It is part of the National Coal Heritage Area. Coal is still mined from the Logan Coalfield, but it is no longer one of the top producing coalfields in West Virginia.
History.
The coalfield has been a large source of high-quality, high-volatile bituminous coal since the field was opened by the completion of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) in 1904. The C&amp;O maintained a rail yard in the district at Peach Creek. Later the Virginian Railway built the "Gilbert Extension" which allowed the shipment of coal from western Wyoming County. Both steam coal and metallurgical coal have been extracted from such seams as the Cedar Grove, Eagle, Alma, and Winifrede.
The coalfield is primarily drained by the Guyandotte River, and there were mines, such as Earling, Lyburn, and Marianna in this main river valley. There has also been heavy mining in tributary hollows of the Guyandotte, such as Island Creek, Rum Creek, and Buffalo Creek. Most coal mining in the Logan Coalfield has been south of the town of Logan, but there were a few coal mines north of Logan and into Lincoln County as well.
This coalfield hosted notable events from the Mine Wars, particularly Logan County Sheriff Don Chafin's victory over UMWA invaders at the Battle of Blair Mountain.
Disasters.
The Logan Coalfield is the site of the Holden 22 Mine disaster. It is also the location of the Buffalo Creek Flood, when a Pittston Coal Company coal refuse dam burst at Buffalo Creek in 1972 and resulted in the death of 125 people and the destruction of about a dozen towns. In 2008 a new coal mine and preparation plant opened at the site of the Pittston refuse dam. More recently the Massey Energy Bandmill preparation plant had a fire in August 2009, resulting in the closure of the plant. This plant processed coal from several mines, including the Aracoma Mine, where two miners lost their lives in a beltline fire, known as the Aracoma Alma Mine accident, in 2006.

Hillman Periodicals

Hillman Periodicals, Inc., was an American magazine and comic book publishing company founded in 1938 by Alex L. Hillman, a former New York City book publisher. It is best known for its true confession and true crime magazines; for the long-running general-interest magazine "Pageant"; and for comic books including "Air Fighters Comics" and its successor "Airboy Comics", which launched the popular characters Airboy and The Heap.
Company history.
Founding.
In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Hillman competed with Bernarr Macfadden and Fawcett Publications by publishing comics, true confessions magazines ("Real Story", "Real Confessions", "Real Romances") and crime magazines ("Crime Detective", "Real Detective", "Crime Confessions").
In 1948 Hillman began publishing paperback books. There were several series of abridged mystery and western novels published in the larger 'digest' size. The long-running Hillman paperbacks first appeared in 1948 and lasted until 1961.
"Pageant" and Airboy.
In 1944, Hillman launched a digest-sized, general-interest, "slick" (glossy paper) magazine, "Pageant", with an initial print run of 500,000 copies. To obtain the paper during World War II wartime rationing, Hillman ended his detective magazines and comics, which together brought in a $250,000 annual profit. He returned to comics in 1946, resuming some titles from the earlier series.
Like most comic book publishers during the period fans and historians called the Golden Age of comic books, Hillman's titles included costumed superheroes. As trends in the comic book market changed, the focus shifted more to crime fiction/detective stories, making Hillman one of the earliest crime comics publishers ("Crime Detective Comics", "Real Clue Crime Stories"), and Westerns ("Dead-Eye Western Comics" and "Western Fighters"). During this time, Hillman often utilized the talents of Captain America creators Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Hillman's most notable character, however, continuing in new stories by another publisher, Eclipse Comics, in the 1980s, was the Charles Biro, Dick Wood and Al Camy-created aviator-adventurer Airboy in "Air Fighters Comics" and its successor, "Airboy Comics".
Later years.
Hillman ceased publishing comic books in 1953, while continuing to launch such new magazines as "Homeland", and "People Today", while also distributing "The Freeman", a journal of libertarian opinion. Amid a 1953 battle for control of directors and editors, publisher Hillman announced his resignation as the "Freeman" treasurer because "it has been almost impossible for the past six months to run the magazine". The following year, Hillman said he was thinking about launching a "conservative Republican" morning newspaper in Washington, D.C., but nothing came of it.
Hillman periodicals also had a publication named "Flight", edited by Norton Wood. (Wood had previously served as managing editor of a highly classified monthly report on air weapons prepared by McGraw-Hill under contract with the U.S. Air Force. Wood had been a member of the editorial staff of "This Week Magazine" and of the U.S. Camera Publishing Co.) "Flight" contained stories of the tremendous revolution going on in the skies - the transition within a decade from air travel as men had understood it for two generations to an entire new era of flight at supersonic speeds and fantastic altitudes, of strange new shapes in aircraft design, of combat planes without pilots, and rocket voyages into outer space. "Flight" chronicled the revolution in the skies with lines of defense of the "H-Bomb" with futuristic drawings by Matt Greene artistically depicting a U.S. coastal city under coordinated attack by Russian bombers and submarines, and giant "inner tube" satellite space stations with depictions proposed by Wernher von Braun orbits in space flight.
Hillman sold "Pageant" to Macfadden Communications Group in April 1961, and the magazine continued until 1977.
Alex L. Hillman.
Publisher Alex L. Hillman was a noted art collector who initially developed an interest in the field when he was a book publisher, commissioning artists to illustrate new editions of classic literature. He was married to Rita Hillman. He began his collection with such American painters as Raphael Soyer and Preston Dickinson, and expanded it to include impressionist and other painters. He eventually established the Alex Hillman Family Foundation, a private foundation in Manhattan, to oversee the collection.

The Other Magpie

The Other Magpie was a Crow woman best known for fighting in the Battle of the Rosebud on the side of General George Crook against the Sioux and Cheyenne, alongside Osh-Tisch.
Pretty Shield, a Crow author and medicine woman, described her as being wild and attractive, but not having a man. She fought for revenge against the Sioux who had killed her brother. Most of the Crow carried rifles, but The Other Magpie carried only her belt knife and her coup stick. She counted coup on a Sioux warrior and eventually killed and scalped him. The scalp that she took was one of only eleven taken in the battle. Shield described her as having tied a feather on the end of her coup stick to symbolize her achievement. Later, she cut the scalp into pieces and gave them to the male warriors so they would have more scalps for the dance after the battle. An alternative report has The Other Magpie take part in the dance herself.

His fiction during this time – two novels and two books of short stories – was characterised by surrealism and absurdism and influenced by writers such as Franz Kafka and James Kelman. Meek has described it as "magical dirty realism".
Meek’s third novel, "The People’s Act of Love", published in 2005, brought him critical acclaim and a wider audience. It was translated into more than twenty languages and earned a number of awards and a nomination for the Booker Prize. "Newsweek" magazine named it one of the top ten works of fiction of the 2000s. Johnny Depp optioned the book for a film adaptation.
"The People's Act of Love", about a woman and her three lovers in a small Siberian town during the Russian Civil War, was followed by "We Are Now Beginning Our Descent" (2008), the story of a journalist who travels to Afghanistan immediately after 9/11, and "The Heart Broke In" (2012), set in contemporary Britain, where a newspaper editor blackmails a TV producer into betraying his sister.
Journalism.
Besides reporting on Britain and the former Soviet Union, Meek covered the military conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq after 9/11. In 2003 he crossed the border from Kuwait into Iraq, following the invading American armies to Baghdad in a small group of journalists that included Dexter Filkins.
In 2014 Meek published "Private Island", a collection of essays, mainly from the "London Review of Books", about the privatisation of Britain.
Awards and honours.
Meek was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2020.

Missy Higgins

Melissa Morrison "Missy" Higgins (born 19 August 1983) is an Australian singer-songwriter and musician. Her most popular singles include "Scar", "Steer", and "Where I Stood". Her Australian number-one albums are "The Sound of White" (2004), "On a Clear Night" (2007) and "The Ol' Razzle Dazzle" (2012). In 2018 she released a greatest hits album called "The Special Ones". 
Higgins was nominated for five ARIA Music Awards in 2004 and won Best Pop Release for "Scar". In 2005, she was nominated for seven more awards and won five. Nominated for many more, Higgins won her seventh ARIA in 2007 and two more in 2012, including Best Adult Contemporary Album for "The Ol' Razzle Dazzle". 
Alongside her music career, Higgins pursues interests in animal rights and the environment, endeavouring to make her tours carbon neutral. In 2009 she made her acting debut in the music feature film "Bran Nue Dae" and also performed on its soundtrack.
Early life and education.
Melissa Morrison Higgins was born in Melbourne on 19 August 1983 to Christopher Higgins, an English-Australian general practitioner, and Margaret (née Morrison), an Australian childcare centre operator. Her sister, Nicola, is seven years older and her brother, David, six years older. Higgins learned to play classical piano from age six, following in the footsteps of Christopher and David, but realised she wanted to be a singer at about 12, when she appeared in an Armadale Primary School production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat". Bored with practice, she gave up playing piano at that time.
Hoping for more freedom, she urged her parents to send her to Geelong Grammar School, an independent boarding school that her siblings attended. At Geelong, Higgins took up the piano again, this time playing jazz and performing with her brother David's group on weekends. Introverted by nature, Higgins found that piano practice helped her cope with living at boarding school.
At 15, while attending Geelong Grammar's Timbertop, she wrote "All for Believing" for a school music assignment, completing it just hours before the deadline. The assignment earned an A and she performed her song in front of classmates. She approached a Melbourne record company and was told that they wanted more than one song. She wrote more songs and worked with the Kool Skools project, which enables students to record music.
In 2001, Missy's sister Nicola entered "All for Believing" on her behalf in Unearthed, radio station Triple J's competition for unsigned artists. The song won the competition and was added to the station's play list.
Career.
Early career.
Two record companies showed an interest in Higgins—Sony and . She signed with Eleven, partly because they agreed that she would not be "made into a pop star" and partly because they were happy for her to take time off for a backpacking holiday. Higgins's manager is Eleven's John Watson, who also managed rock band Silverchair. Watson later disclosed that "Missy's the only time in my career I knew after 90 seconds I really wanted to sign her." The backpacking trip had been planned with a friend for years and the pair spent most of 2002 in Europe; while Higgins was travelling, "All for Believing" started to receive airplay on Los Angeles radio station KCRW. Such radio exposure attracted the attention of American record labels and, by year's end, an international recording deal with Warner Bros. had been negotiated.
2003–2005: "The Sound of White".
Higgins was the support act on a 2003 Australian tour by folk rock band The Waifs and rock band george. She travelled to the US to work with John Porter, who produced her first EP, "The Missy Higgins EP", which was released in November and entered the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Singles Chart Top 50 in August 2004.
She toured Australia, supporting Pete Murray and John Butler Trio. Her four-track single "Scar" was released in July 2004 and debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Charts. Her first album, "The Sound of White", was released in September, and debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Also produced by Porter, it sold over 500,000 copies. She was nominated in five categories at the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 for "Scar": Best Female Artist', 'Single of the Year', 'Best Pop Release', 'Breakthrough Artist – Single' and 'Best Video' (directed by Squareyed Films). At the awards ceremony on 17 October, she received the award for Best Pop Release, beating Delta Goodrem, The Dissociatives, Kylie Minogue and Pete Murray. This was followed by her first national headline tour. Her second single "Ten Days" was co-written with Jay Clifford (guitarist in US band Jump, Little Children) and was inspired by Higgins's 2002 break-up with her boyfriend before she travelled to Europe. Released in November, it peaked at No. 12.
On 29 January 2005, Higgins performed with other local musicians including Nick Cave and Powderfinger at the WaveAid fundraising concert in the Sydney Cricket Ground. The concert raised A$2.3 million for four charities supporting the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. In March Higgins performed at the MTV Australia Awards and won the prize for 'Breakthrough Artist of the Year'. The following month she released her third single, "The Special Two", which was a radio hit and reached No. 2. "The Special Two" was released and included her cover of the Skyhooks song, "You Just Like Me Cos I'm Good in Bed", recorded for Triple J's 30th anniversary. The song had been the first track played on Triple J when it launched (as Double J) in 1975. In May, Higgins won the 'Song of the Year' and 'Breakthrough' awards for "Scar" from the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA). She continued touring in mid-2005 and released her fourth single, "The Sound of White", in August. In September she played a sold-out performance at the Vanguard in Sydney with the proceeds going to charity. She was nominated for seven more ARIAs and in October won 'Album of the Year', 'Best Pop Release', 'Breakthrough Artist – Album' and 'Highest Selling Album' (all for "The Sound of White") and 'Best Female Artist' (for "Scar"). She teamed up with fellow ARIA award-winning singer Ben Lee in late 2005 for a national tour.
2006–2009: "On a Clear Night".
During 2006, Higgins lived in Broome, Western Australia for six months, away from the entertainment industry. The relaxed lifestyle helped her focus on writing new material. The landscape made a big impression, "It was the first place I'd ever felt honestly connected with my country, with the physical land of my country" and inspired her to write "Going North". She then toured the United States and South Africa, writing more material on the road. In September she based herself in Los Angeles to record her second album, "On a Clear Night", with producer Mitchell Froom. "Steer" was released on 14 April 2007, followed a fortnight later by its album on 28 April 2007, both debuted at No. 1 on their respective charts.
In February, Higgins had contributed a tribute song to the album, "Cannot Buy My Soul", for noted indigenous singer, Kev Carmody, singing "Droving Woman" with musician Paul Kelly and group Augie March. On 7 July, she participated in the Live Earth concert in Sydney, performing her own set before joining Carmody, Kelly and vocalist John Butler on stage for the song "From Little Things Big Things Grow". Emily Dunn in "The Sydney Morning Herald" wrote "[the song] could have been the event's anthem". "Rolling Stone"s Dan Lander pointed out a highlight, when the "whole crowd sung along – all eleven verses."
Higgins returned to Los Angeles to focus on the US market—she spent September and October touring—where she was still relatively unknown. On 26 October, backed by the Sydney Youth Orchestra, she headlined the annual Legs 11 concert, a breast cancer benefit held in The Domain, Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. Two days later Higgins performed at the 2007 ARIAs where she was nominated for 'Best Pop Release', 'Highest Selling Album' and 'Highest Selling Single' (for "Steer") and won 'Best Female Artist' (for "On a Clear Night")—her seventh ARIA Music Award. On 31 October, she was a guest at television music channel MAX's inaugural Concert for the Cure, a private concert for people affected by breast cancer. She sang headline act Powderfinger's "Sunsets" with front man Bernard Fanning and joined in with the encore of "These Days". She spent November and December on her For One Night Only Tour, taking in Cairns, Sydney and Perth. You Am I lead singer, Tim Rogers, joined her on some shows.
"On a Clear Night", was released in the US on 26 February 2008, supported by a tour in March. Her ten-month stay in Los Angeles during 2008 promoted her songs for films and television shows. Her first US single "Where I Stood" was featured in US series including "Smallville", "Grey's Anatomy", "Ghost Whisperer", "One Tree Hill" and "So You Think You Can Dance". During 2008, Higgins supported the Indigo Girls and then Ben Folds on their respective US tours. February and March 2009 saw her co-headlining a US tour with Canadian Justin Nozuka. On 31 March 2009 she released "More Than This" which was recorded as part of "Covered, A Revolution in Sound", a Warner Bros. tribute album also released in March 2009.
2010–2013: "The Ol' Razzle Dazzle".
Higgins started writing music for her third album in 2009. After about seven years of touring and recording she took a break from the music industry to pursue other interests. In 2010 she enrolled in a course in indigenous studies at the University of Melbourne. Her acting debut was as Annie in 2009 film "Bran Nue Dae" directed by Rachel Perkins. The film is an adaptation of the 1990 musical "Bran Nue Dae", "Australia's first Aboriginal musical". Although Higgins would consider future acting projects, she had no plans to actively pursue it as a career.
In July and August 2010, Higgins played several dates of Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair tour in the US. At Lilith Fair, she met Australian musician Butterfly Boucher and they decided to work together. In 2011, Higgins travelled to where Boucher was living in Nashville to record her third album, which is co-produced by Boucher and Brad Jones. Titled "The Ol' Razzle Dazzle", the album was released on 1 June 2012. Its first single, "Unashamed Desire", co-written with Boucher, was released on 23 April. In November 2011, at the ARIA Music Awards, Higgins performed a duet of "Warwu" with Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, from his "Rrakala" album.
"The Ol' Razzle Dazzle" album debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart the week of 12 June 2012. It was Higgins' 3rd straight number one album. As of January 2019, Higgins ties Olivia Newton-John for the 3rd highest tally of Australian Number One albums by an Australian female artist. Only Delta Goodrem (with four Number 1 ARIA albums) and Kylie Minogue and Kasey Chambers (with five each) have achieved more.
2014: "Oz".
In September 2014, Higgins released her fourth studio album, "Oz", which features cover versions of Australian composers, including The Angels, Slim Dusty, Something For Kate, Warumpi Band, Paul Kelly and The Drones. The album is also accompanied by a book of related essays, in which Higgins uses each of the recordings to reflect upon subjects such as music and love. Higgins collaborated with Dan Sultan for the recording of the Slim Dusty song "The Biggest Disappointment".
Higgins explained in an October 2014 interview that she experienced a significant bout of writer's block following the completion of her second album and someone suggested an album of cover versions at the time, but she only revisited the idea during the conception of "Oz". Higgins further explained:
I responded to all these songs on an emotional level, when I first heard them. I wanted songs I felt I could tell with my own voice, and interpret them authentically ... But it was important to maintain the emotional integrity and the heart of the song. It was a high priority to keep true to the songs.
The album was co-produced by Jherek Bischoff, who previously worked with David Byrne, formerly of Talking Heads, and Amanda Palmer.
"Oz" debuted at number 3 on the ARIA Albums chart and remained in the top five positions until 18 October 2014.
The national Australian tour in support of "Oz" commenced on 20 September 2014 in Cairns, Queensland, and ended in Melbourne in October 2014. Higgins was accompanied by Bischoff, and Australian artist Dustin Tebbutt appeared as a special guest.
2015–2023: "Solastalgia", "The Special Ones" and "Total Control".
On 19 February 2016, Higgins released a new single titled, "Oh Canada", in her response to the death of Alan Kurdi.
In May 2017, Higgins released "Torchlight", for the Australian drama film, "Don't Tell".
In October 2017, Higgins appeared in a revival of the 1996 musical "Miracle City" by Nick Enright and Max Lambert at the Sydney Opera House, playing the role of Bonnie Mae.
In February 2018, Higgins released the single "Futon Couch", the first single from her fifth studio album, called "Solastalgia", released in May 2018.
In February 2018, it was announced that Missy Higgins would support Ed Sheeran's tour around Australia.
In November 2018, Higgins released her first greatest hits album titled "The Special Ones". A stand-alone single, "When the Machine Starts", was released in November 2020; a second, "Edge of Something", was released in October 2021.
In October 2019, new music by Higgins featured in the Australian television series "Total Control". This would later serve as the basis of a mini-album, also titled "Total Control", that Higgins released on 4 March 2022.
2024: "The Second Act".
On 23 February 2024, Higgins released "You Should Run", the lead single from her forthcoming sixth studio album. The album, titled "The Second Act", was released on 6 September 2024. The album was written in the wake of the breakup of her marriage in December 2021, and the songs deal with the sadness associated with this event.
Musical influences and technique.
Higgins grew up in the 1980s and 1990s listening to artists that her older siblings liked—Nicola played Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, while David favoured Queen and Kiss. Departing for boarding school at age 13, she was exposed to alternative artists like Nirvana and Hole and started teaching herself guitar and writing her own music. She also began singing with David's jazz group on weekends. As an adult she prefers Nina Simone and Ray Charles to "poppy dance music". She has cited Patty Griffin, Ron Sexsmith, Rufus Wainwright, Paul Kelly and Sarah McLachlan as influences. Material from her third album is influenced by ambient music from Low, Jon Hopkins, Icelandic band Sigur Rós and Estonian classical composer Arvo Pärt.
Higgins's songwriting grew out of a desire to express her emotions when she was at school, and her lyrics describe her feelings about her own life and relationships. The piano was the first instrument she learned to play, and she continues to use it as well as digital pianos, including a Roland RD-300SX, RD-700 and KR-15. She also uses guitars extensively in her music—particularly when touring, due to their portable nature—and favours the Australian brand Maton. On occasion, she plays keytar, xylophone and melodica during performances.
On 7 September 2012, Higgins recorded a cover version of Gotye's "Heart's A Mess" for the "Like a Version" segment on Australian radio station Triple J, explaining on-air that the song is her favourite Gotye composition. Higgins had travelled with Gotye previously and referred to him as "an incredible singer" in the interview prior to the rendition.
In the 2020 Australian documentary film "Slim and I", directed by Kriv Stenders, Higgins paid tribute to the influence on her life and career of acclaimed Australian country music singer-songwriter couple Slim Dusty and Joy McKean. The film features interviews and covers of McKean songs by acclaimed contemporary artists including Higgins ("The Biggest Disappointment"), Keith Urban, Paul Kelly, and Troy Cassar-Daley.
She has also been a creative inspiration for a number of Artists including Gretta Ray, Angie McMahon, G Flip and Amy Shark
Activism and charitable works.
Higgins has been active and vocal about many issues including climate and environmental issues, animal welfare, female empowerment, refugees and Indigenous issues. These issues have been influential to her works throughout her career.
Climate and environment.
Higgins has been a longtime advocate for the environment and has actively participated in many environmental initiatives and events aimed at raising awareness on climate change and environmental issues. She is currently a patron of Green Music Australia, which aims to harness the cultural power of music to create a greener and safer planet.
From her early tours such as her On A Clear Night tour, Higgins has aimed for her tours to be carbon neutral, and she was named one of Billboard magazine's 2007 Top 10 Green Artists. She also contributed to Green Music Australia and Creative Victoria's 2022 initiative 'Sound Country: A Green Artist Guide' which aims to provide a practical framework for touring musicians to implement sustainable solutions.
Higgins has also participated in many environmental fundraising and donation campaigns including the Sierra Club's 2009 2% Solution Campaign where she made her song "Where I Stood" available for free to those who pledged to decrease their carbon output by 2% . Higgins also donated royalties from her 2009 "More Than This" to the Save the Kimberley organisation focused on conservation of Western Australia's Kimberley Region; an area which Higgins is passionate about protecting from industrialisation. In October 2012, Higgins also performed at two "Save the Kimberley" events held at Federation Square in Melbourne and The Esplanade in Fremantle, Western Australia; march to protest against the proposed gas refinery construction at James Price Point accompanied the free concert and campaign supporters were photographed with banners and placards.
Higgins was among 21 artists to write and record music for the album 'Sounds for the Reef' which raised funds for legal action against plans to turn Queensland's Abbot Point into one of the world's largest coal ports and the decision to allow dredging near the Great Barrier Reef. The album's 21 songs were sold on the Bandcamp website.
Higgins also vocally protested against the Adani coal mine in 2017, writing an open letter to the former Australian Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and former Australian Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, and donating time to narrating two campaign videos and the #StopAdani Roadshow Opener.
Climate change played a large role in the creation of the music for her 2018 album 'Solostalgia', which was named for a kind of distress brought on by environmental changes close to home. The album is also influenced by the feeling of climate grief and climate anxiety.
Animal welfare.
Higgins has been a vegetarian for many years after being introduced to the idea by an ex-boyfriend and wanted to do something for animals rights after reading 'Eating Animals' by Jonathan Safran Foer. She helped promote the 2005 People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) advertising campaign and has supported their anti-fur stance.
In 2012, Higgins voiced a series of radio advertisements organised by the group Animals Australia in a campaign to put an end to battery-hen egg production in Australia. Higgins was one of numerous publicly known advocates for the 'Oscar's Law' campaign. The campaign, launched in 2010, protests against the existence of "puppy factories" in Australia, whereby animals are factory farmed. One of the campaign's slogans was "Break the Puppy Trade—Don't buy puppies from pet shops" and the list of notable advocates included Paul Dempsey, Kate Ceberano and Mick Molloy.
Higgins has also performed at animal welfare and conservation related fundraising and awareness concerts.This includes kicking off Animal Australia's 2013 event 'Animal Matters' with a performance of 'Hidden Ones', and performing at Melbourne Zoo's Twilights concert in 2012, 2013 and the 2020 where proceeds from the event went to conservation efforts and aims to save threatened species.
Refugees.
In 2016, Missy Higgins released "Oh Canada", which was written from the perspective of the refugee father of Alan Kurdi, a two-year-old Syrian boy who drowned while fleeing to Europe. All of the song's net profits went to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC), and Higgins performed the song during the ASRC telethon held on World Refugee Day. In 2017 Higgins was announced as a new ASRC Ambassador and in 2018 appeared on ABC's Q&amp;A program and expressed her views on the Australian Government's treatment of asylum seekers.
Higgins also featured in the 2022 documentary 'Scattered People: A Song Can Take You Home' presented by the ASRC and Being Reel Films, along with other Australian Musicians.
Female empowerment.
"Rolling Stone Australia" called Higgins's soundtrack for the second season of the ABC drama Total Control an "outspoken fight for equality", and the work was inspired by Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins and the 2021 Australian Parliament House sexual misconduct allegations, with themes of exploitation and female empowerment. The album was about taking control as a woman, with songs like 'I Take It Back' which was written about reclaiming story, identity and power as a woman.
In 2021, Higgins appeared on the panel of ABC's Q&amp;A Season Finale 'Power, Protests and Parliament' and discussed her views on the behaviour of Australian Parliament in relation to women in parliament, advice for young women who want to move into the music industry and the power imbalance of the music industry.
Higgins also headlined the all-female festival tour Wildflower in 2022 alongside Kate Miller-Heidke, Kasey Chambers, Sarah Blasko, Deborah Conway, Thornbird and Alice Skye in order to celebrate women and the return of the live scene.
Generational strength has also been a motivator for Higgins, wanting to show her daughter how to be a strong, independent woman.
Indigenous issues.
Higgins undertook an Indigenous Studies course at the University of Melbourne and has been a supporter of Indigenous Australian peoples. In 2007 she joined the Oxfam Australia 'Close the Gap' campaign and recorded a cover of 'Droving Woman' with Augie March on the tribute album to Kev Carmody, an Aboriginal Australian singer-songwriter and musician. In 2008, Higgins collaborated on a re-release of the song "From Little Things Big Things Grow" along with Tim Levison and others. The song begins with a sample from the 2008 Formal Apology to the Stolen Generations made by former Australia Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
When discussing the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, Higgins stated that First Nations people have never been treated as equals and have been oppressed as a people.
Higgins mentioned that her album Total Control was partly inspired by strong First Nations women who she knew and in an interview with Rolling Stone Australia, Higgin's was quoted saying "Australian First Nations people have to cop so much every day and they're still surviving in a country that refuses to acknowledge our history.".
Other charitable works.
Higgins has also been involved in other charitable works throughout her career.
All proceeds from her 2015 charity show at Sydney's 'The Vanguard' were donated to the One In Five Foundation, a Melbourne charity supporting research into mental health.
In 2020, along with Tim Minchin, Higgins gave her support to the Fred Hollows Foundation with the collaborative song "Carry You" which was adapted to the foundation's 2020 campaign to encourage people to carry on Fred Hollows's legacy of ending avoidable blindness. She also performed the song with Minchin at the streamed charity concert Music from the Home Front which paid tribute to the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps and workers on the frontline of COVID-19 pandemic responses. Proceeds from the album of the same name went towards the music crisis charity Support Act.
In 2022, Higgins headlined the Nine Network telethon concert in support of the Children's Hospital Foundation, raising funds for medical research, equipment and support services for young patients and their families. Higgins also joined the Australian Red Cross event "" along with other Australian artists in order to raise funds for victims of the 2022 eastern Australia floods.
Personal life.
Higgins has been a patron of multiple mental health charities since 2003. She described her younger self as introverted, and that she had "experienced various degrees of depression" from childhood onwards. Prescribed antidepressant medication while in high school, she learned to channel low moods into songwriting, calling music her "emotional outlet". In a 2006 interview she said that her songs were "coming from more of a happier place". While recording her second album, she discovered a passion for rock climbing, as a "meditative pursuit"
From 2004 to 2007, Higgins's sexual orientation was the subject of media speculation based partly on interpretations of her lyrics and her interviews. In an October 2007 interview with Australian lesbian magazine "Cherrie", she was asked if she fell under the moniker of "not-so-straight" girls. She replied "Yeah, definitely. ... I think sexuality is a fluid thing and it's becoming increasingly more acceptable to admit that you're that way." In November 2007, her Myspace page and website reported, "I've been in relationships with both men and women so I guess I fall most easily under the category 'Bisexual'." In 2024 it was revealed that she had had a relationship with her female tour manager during those early years.
In 2013, Higgins began a relationship with Broome playwright and comedian Dan Lee. Higgins gave birth to a son in 2015. Higgins and Lee were married in March 2016, and she gave birth to a daughter in August 2018. 
In early 2022, Higgins and Lee separated amicably. The songs on her 2024 album, "The Second Act", were written during and following the breakup. She spoke at some length about her career and relationships on "Australian Story" in August 2024.

The Strangest Party (These Are the Times)

"The Strangest Party (These Are the Times)" is a song by Australian band INXS. The track was written by Andrew Farriss and Michael Hutchence and produced by Chris Thomas. It was included as a new track on their 1994 compilation album "The Greatest Hits". Released as a single in October 1994 by Mercury Records, the song reached number 15 on the UK Singles Chart and number 30 on the Australian Singles Chart. The accompanying music video for the single features the band performing in a futuristic, black sci-fi like setting.
Background.
The song "The Strangest Party (These Are the Times)", alongside the song "Deliver Me", was recorded for the group's Greatest Hits release with producer Chris Thomas, however, the music for the song was originally written by Andrew Farriss during the recording sessions of the band's previous studio album, "Full Moon, Dirty Hearts". During the recording of "Deliver Me", the band wanted to add a second new track on the record, and decided to use the material that Andrew had previously written. The lyrics for the song were later added in by Michael Hutchence.
Lyrics.
In one interview during the promotion of their Greatest Hits release, Hutchence described the song as a commentary on the band's lifestyle, particularly the lyrics: "You're part of the solution or part of the problem." He also mentions this in the album's liner notes: "I think this new album and especially the new single, 'The Strangest Party' sums up our time so far with INXS. It's certainly been the strangest party I've ever been to."
Critical reception.
Upon the release, Larry Flick from "Billboard" magazine wrote, "New tune placed on band's greatest-hits album mines a familiar and somewhat safe field of funk-fortified rock. After the somewhat experimental nature of its last project, this will probably connect with fans who just want to jam. Smarter minds, however, will be fed by the song's clever lyrics, which are craftily delivered through a catchy, accessible melody." A reviewer from "Music &amp; Media" commented, "The impression you get is of "The Best of INXS" rolled into one track. It's funky like their first singles, but the open dancey production is the "new sensation" here." Alan Jones from "Music Week" gave it a full score of five out of five and named it Pick of the Week, adding, "A loose, brooding new cut from the band's forthcoming Greatest Hits album is well up to the usual standard, with a powerful vocal from Hutchence and an exciting mix from Apollo 440, which should also give the band a dance hit."
B-sides.
The B-sides were a selection of remixes of album tracks as well as "Sing Something" a solo composition by guitarist Tim Farriss.

Ragged Keys

Ragged Keys are small islands north of the upper Florida Keys.
They are located in Biscayne Bay, just north of Sands Key, and are part of Biscayne National Park.
Earlier names for these islands were "Knox Island", "Laurence Island", "Los Paradisos", "Mascaras", "Mucaras", "Mucasas", "Pollock Island" and "Soldiers Island".
History.
Bernard Romans, who visited these keys in 1774, wrote that these were "Seven rocks called Mascaras", which he said had been "Ill copied on English charts as Mucares".
The northernmost of the Ragged Keys, sometimes referred to as Ragged Key #1 was previously inhabited. There are rotted remains of an old wooden dock and a deteriorated concrete wall which encircles much of the island. Concrete pillars and another concrete structure sometimes described as a 'cistern' can also be found on the island.

Shivamara II

Shivamara II or Saigotta Shivamara was the son of Sripurusha and ruled the Western Ganga Dynasty from 788 – 816 C.E. He was also a noted an important patron of Jainism. He was also known as a scholar, writing works such as "Gajashtaka" (in Kannada), "Gajamathakalpana" (in Sanskrit), and Sethubandha (in Prakrit), though these texts are now lost. According to historian Kamath, he is considered to be one of the famous kings of the Western Ganga Dynasty.
He succeeded to the Ganga throne during a time when the Rashtrakuta were the empire on the rise in South India and the Deccan.
Reign.
Shivamāra II ascended the throne after his father Sripurusha and faced repeated conflict with the rising Rashtrakuta power. Captured multiple times by King Dhruva Dharavarsha and later Govinda III, he was imprisoned for refusing tribute. Still, he repeatedly rebelled and regained his throne, dying fighting for independence around 816 CE.
Conflict with Rashtrakuta.
The Rashtrakuta monarch Dhruva Dharavarsha defeated Shivamara in Mudagunduru and took the Ganga king captive. The Rashtrakuta then took direct control of the Gangavadi with the appointment of Kambharasa, son of Dhruva Dharavarsha as its governor. He was later released, only to be imprisoned again during the rule of Govinda III when he refused to pay the Rashtrakuta tribute. Shivamara II again was released only to defy the Rashtrakuta yoke by waging wars. He died fighting them in 816. Manne near Bangalore was one of his capitals during this time.
Religion and Patronage.
A staunch Follower of Jainism, Shivamāra II undertook extensive temple-building and granted land to Jain monasteries at Shravanabelagola, Kummadavāda, Hebbalaguppe, and Mulivalli. He continued the Ganga dynasty's legacy of religious patronage and is credited with commissioning the Chandraprabha Basadi and other early basadis.
Jain Monk Kumudendu Muni, in his own writing "Siribhoovalaya", described that he has been the guru of Shivamara II along with Rashtrkuta king Amoghavarsha
Legacy.
Shivamāra II is considered one of the golden champions of Jain royalty in Karnataka. His reign anchored Jain architecture and scholarly traditions, setting the stage for his successor Rachamalla I and later rulers like Marasimha II and the minister Chavundaraya.

Alifereti Finau Ulugalala

Ratu Alifereti Finau (1869 – 3 April 1934) was the eleventh "Sau ni Vanua" of Lau and the fifth "Tui Nayau". He was a member of the noble household Matailakeba.
Biography.
"Ratu" Finau was born in 1869, the son of "Ratu" Tevita Uluilakeba II and "Adi" Asenaca Kakua Vuikaba, daughter of the Vunivalu of Bau and self-styled King of Fiji, "Ratu" Seru Epenisa Cakobau. He married Adi Ateca Moceiwaqa, the daughter of "Ratu" Epeli Nailatikau I, the Vunivalu of Bau in 1896, and eldest son of "Ratu" Seru Epenisa Cakobau.
His father was in line to become the next Tui Nayau, but died before the title was passed on. As "Ratu" Finau was still a minor when the title was passed, it instead passed to his granduncle "Ratu" Eroni Loganimoce, "Roko" Taliai Tupou's son.
In 1898 with the death of Ratu Eroni Loganimoce, Ratu Penaia Kadavulevu, Vunivalu of Bau, went to Lau and made Ratu Finau as Sau ni Vanua and Tui Nayau ahead of Ratu Salesi Kinikinilau (Ratu Eroni's nephew and Ratu Finau's rival for the title).
It is assumed that a possible reason for Ratu Kadavulevu's eventual selection was due to the notion of dynastic extensions of power, as Ratu Finau was not only a first cousin but also married to his sister, Adi Ateca Moceiwaqa. Adi Moce as she is commonly referred to, is recorded to have been influential in introducing Bauan standards, manners and protocols in Lakeba which in time became dominant. This marriage between first cousins was not uncommon in Fijian families at the time. (Adi Moce &amp; Ratu Kadavulevu's father was Ratu Epeli Nailatikau I, eldest son of Ratu Cakobau; Ratu Finau's mother was another of Cakobau's daughters Adi Asenaca Kakua).
Ratu Finau was responsible and instrumental in promoting his nephew's Ratu Lala Sukuna's education overseas. It is recorded that he levied one ton of copra from every adult male in Lau in order to fund Ratu Sukuna's education. His intention for this was that he saw the need to groom a powerful and articulate indigenous spokesman in government and in the councils of the nation to combat the increasing aggressive promotion of their own interests by Indians and Europeans. In time his nephew Ratu Sukuna would realise his intentions by becoming one of the most respected leaders of modern Fiji.
He founded the first school Lau Provincial School in Tubou, Lakeba in 1908, which recruited staff from the United Kingdom. Some early pioneering teachers at this school included the ethnographer and anthropologist Arthur Maurice Hocart.
Ratu Finau died in Tubou on 3 April 1934 at the age of 65 and was succeeded by his son, Ratu Tevita Uluilakeba III

Inlander (newspaper)

Inlander, officially The Pacific Northwest Inlander, is a free weekly newspaper published in Spokane, Washington, and circulated throughout the Inland Northwest, covering local news and culture. It is published in print and online every Thursday. A member of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, it was founded in 1993 by Ted S. McGregor, Jr. and J. Jeremy McGregor, who still own it. Nicholas Deshais became the paper's editor in September 2022.
History.
Hannelore Sudermann, for the "University of Washington Magazine", wrote that "Inlander" "first decade was rough. Potential advertisers turned them away, saying they wanted to wait a year or so to see if the paper survived. [...] While Ted led the editorial side of the paper, it was up to Jer to sort out the business. They all worked late into the night to meet the deadline, building the issue page-by-page. [...] In addition to selling ads, Jer taught himself to design them so he could help out the small-scale advertisers. He is the force behind the paper's broader projects and sponsorships like a regional guide called the Annual Manual and yearly events like the Inlander Music Festival, the Inlander Winter Party and the Inlander Restaurant Week".
In 2011, the "Inlander" moved their office space from the Civic Building to the Hutton Building in Spokane; this was the fifth office location since the newspaper was founded. The newspaper had 36 full-time employees. In 2013, the newspaper moved to a building it owns and occupies in Spokane's Kendall Yards development. S. McGregor said: "In 2010, we had sales growth of 3 percent, and we think we're poised to continue to grow". Jacob H. Fries was the paper's editor from 2012 to 2021.
In 2016, the "Inlander" was named one of the "10 newspapers that do it right" by media industry journal "Editor &amp; Publisher".
In May 2020, "The" "Seattle Times" reported that the "Inlander" had a "bad-news Zoom meeting [on] March 27 [...]. Fries had laid off copy editor Quinn Welsch and staff writer Josh Kelety the day before, which the newsroom text-message network had spread around. But there was another surprise. Fries had to cut the remaining news staff to half-time. On Zoom, they divvied up the workload, and Fries told them to use paid hours to start their underemployment claims with the Washington Economic Security Department". Two weeks later, the "Inlander" had received "one of the first Payroll Protection Program loans for a Washington news company: $436,500 to cover personnel costs for eight weeks". Both Welsch and Kelety were brought back on staff and continued to write for the paper.
In September 2020, "The Washington Post" reported that "Inlander" reporter Daniel Walters had received a "barrage of hateful insults" and a "threatening voice mail" from Washington state Rep. Jenny Graham after Walters "wrote a story that day about Graham sharing false articles on Facebook, including a story claiming thousands of missing children are kept in dungeons and raped by demons" and other QAnon conspiracies. In his follow-up piece, Walters fact-checked "his earlier story and including the full recording of his interview with Graham, as well as the audio from a threatening voice mail she left him. [...] Walters said he didn't write the story to shame Graham for cursing him out or posting about him on Facebook, rather to set the record straight".
Dan Nailen replaced Fries as editor in September 2021; Nicholas Deshais assumed the role in September 2022. In April 2024, Chey Scott was promoted to editor; she joined Inlander in 2012 and had been the arts and culture editor since 2022.
Alumni.
A number of notable journalists, writers and artists have worked at the "Inlander" over the past several decades, including:

Sporting Clube da Horta (handball)

Sporting Clube da Horta is a professional handball team based in Horta, Azores, Portugal. It plays in the Liga Portuguesa de Andebol.
Background.
Sporting Clube da Horta was founded on May 28, 1923, being the 80th Branch of Sporting Clube de Portugal.
SC da Horta, based on the island of Horta in the Azores, started out as a football club, having even won the first district championship played in the Azores, in the 1930/31 season. In 2009/10, it played in the AF da Horta District Championship, but previously participated in the Azores Series of the 3rd National Division.
However, it is in handball that SC da Horta has distinguished itself most. In particular, in 2006 it managed to reach the final of the Challenge Cup (the second most important European handball competition), which it played against the Romanian team Steaua Bucharest. After winning the first game in Faial by 26–21 on 22 April 2006, SC da Horta lost by 34–27 in Bucharest.

Alexis Nihon Complex

Alexis Nihon Complex ("French: Complexe Alexis Nihon") is a building complex situated at the border of Downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada and the neighbouring city of Westmount, consisting of a shopping mall, two office towers, and a residential building. Although the complex is typically associated with Downtown Montreal and its main entrance on Atwater Avenue is in Montreal proper, more than 80% of the land it occupies is located in Westmount. It is named after the inventor and businessman Alexis Nihon. The shopping mall is directly connected to the Atwater metro station, which joins the building by a short tunnel with the adjacent Dawson College, and by a longer one adjoins nearby Westmount Square. The original complex was designed by the Montreal architect Harold Ship, and its architectural plans are housed at the Canadian Centre for Architecture.
Construction of Alexis Nihon Plaza, as the complex was originally called, began in September 1965. The shopping mall inaugurated on April 17, 1967 but its stores didn't actually start doing business until the next day (with the notable exception of one retailer that had opened a day in advance by mistake). It was the first shopping centre in North America with three levels. The Miracle Mart store occupied all three levels of the shopping mall at , making it the largest of the retailer's locations at the time. The Steinberg's supermarket was one of the largest built by the company back then. Only the shopping mall opened in April 1967 but it was already decided back then that office and high-rise apartment buildings would be added in subsequent phases.
On October 26, 1986, a major fire heavily damaged its 16-story office building and is still considered the city's biggest fire in a skyscraper. At least six stories were destroyed in the blaze. The federal government, who was a tenant of the building when the fire occurred, sued on August 18, 1988 the then-owner for $585,000, accusing them of being negligent and careless in the maintenance of the Alexis Nihon Complex. In 2002, the Service de sécurité incendie de Montréal was heavily blamed for negligence and incompetence by the Cour d'Appel du Québec in their handling of the 1986 fire. Two office towers, taller than the originals, have since been added atop the shopping complex at 3400 and 3500 De Maisonneuve Boulevard West.
During the Dawson shooting incident on September 13, 2006, the building was fully evacuated.
On April 5, 2017, a minor fire broke out near the roof of the food court. Minor damage occurred as a result.
The shopping mall portion is anchored by Canadian Tire, IGA, Sports Experts, Winners and Pharmaprix.
The block now containing the mall was once the site of Atwater Park, home of the Montreal Royals baseball team through 1927.
Directions.
Alexis Nihon, at the corner of Atwater Avenue and Ste-Catherine Street West, is accessible:
Stores.
The complex is directly connected to the Atwater Metro station and offers numerous services, a variety of shops and superstores, and a food court with over 25 restaurants. From 1982 until 1986, it housed Montreal's first IKEA Store, which due to a lack of space, moved out to a new location. Alexis Nihon also previously housed Miracle Mart (later becoming an M-Store), a three-screen cinema operated by Cineplex Odeon, Zellers and Steinberg's supermarket. When the complex first opened in 1967 the French department store Au Printemps opened it first location outside France.
Food court renovations.
In early 2025, the complex has announced that they will renovate the food court. The construction work officially begun since March 1, 2025. This led to the closure of the restaurants on it, during the entire work. It is expected to be done by late 2026.

Portland Expo Center

The Portland Expo Center, officially the Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center, is a convention center located in the Kenton neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, United States. Opened in the early 1920s as a livestock exhibition and auction facility, the center now hosts over 100 events a year, including green consumer shows, trade shows, conventions, meetings and other special events. Located on the north side of Portland near Vancouver, Washington, it includes the northern terminus for the Yellow Line of Portland's light-rail transit system and has connections to TriMet Bus Line 11-Rivergate/Marine Dr.
History.
The complex was originally built in the early 1920s as the Pacific International Livestock Exposition, and operated as a livestock exhibition, cattle grading, and auction facility. Alexander Chalmers, Centerville/Forest Grove, breeder of Shorthorn cattle; Frank Brown, Carlton, breeder of Shropshire sheep and Shorthorn cattle; Herb Chandler, Baker, breeder of Hereford Cattle; A.C. Ruby, Portland, breeder of Clydesdale horses; O.M. Plumber, a Portland businessman; and W.B. Ayre, Portland, a wealthy lumberman as a group formed the Pacific International Livestock Show in Portland. The first year of the show (approx. 1920), the stock, including cattle, horses, sheep, and pigs, were housed in the beef cattle covered pens. Two huge exhibition tents were erected for the judging of the stock.
Later, a building was constructed adjacent to the North Portland stockyards, which was next to Swift &amp; Co. slaughter and processing plant. Subsequent shows were held in this building, which still stood as of 1979. It is now owned by the Multnomah County Fair Association.
The show later had a side line of holding huge auctions of livestock for breeding purposes.
Later the show included horse show and rodeo venues.
From May 2 to September 10, 1942, the center suspended livestock exposition operations and served as a Civilian Assembly Center under President Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, which authorized the eviction and confinement of Japanese Americans living on the West Coast during World War II. 3,676 people of Japanese descent were confined in the hastily converted animal corrals for a period of five months, while they awaited transfer to more permanent camps in California, Idaho and Wyoming. "Voices of Remembrance", an installation piece by Portland artist Valerie Otani, acts as a memorial honoring the people held at the Portland Assembly Center in 1942.
For three months in the summer of 1959, the Oregon Centennial Exposition was held at the site. Among various attractions, the centennial exposition featured a railroad line that used two trains built for the then-new Portland Zoo Railway (now the Washington Park and Zoo Railway), on temporary loan.
Multnomah County acquired the facility in 1965; it was renamed the Multnomah County Exposition Center. It became home to the annual Multnomah County Fair in 1970, and the fairs were held there through 1996. After the Metropolitan Exposition and Recreation Commission of Metro, the regional government for the Portland metropolitan area, took over ownership and management of the facility in 1994, the complex was renamed Portland Expo Center. It has since undergone major renovations.
Events at the Expo Center include the Portland Better Living Home and Garden Show, Antique and Collectible Show, and Christmas Bazaar.
Amenities.
Halls A, B, and C are currently the oldest buildings in the complex. Halls A and B have ceiling heights, and Hall C has a ceiling height. Hall A has of space and can accommodate up to 2,726; Hall B has of space and can seat up to 2,700; Hall C has of space, seats up to 4,736.
Hall D, the newest building in the complex (built in 2001), replaced an older exhibit hall. It has of space and a ceiling height, can be divided into two exhibit halls and can seat up to 7,000. Hall E, built in 1997, is the largest exhibit hall in the complex, with of space and a ceiling height. It seats up to 9,000. Halls D and E are connected by a connector. East Hall has of space. The complex has many meeting rooms and a total of of exhibit space.

HAT-P-1b

HAT-P-1b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the Sun-like star HAT-P-1, also known as ADS 16402 B. HAT-P-1 is the dimmer component of the ADS 16402 binary star system. It is located roughly 521 light years away from Earth in the constellation Lacerta. HAT-P-1b is among the least dense of any of the known extrasolar planets.
Discovery.
HAT-P-1b was detected by searching for astronomical transits of the parent star by orbiting planets. As the planet passes in front of its parent star (as seen from Earth), it blocks a small amount of the light reaching us from the star. HAT-P-1b was first detected by a dip of 0.6% in the light from the star. This enabled determination of the planet's radius and orbital period. The discovery was made by the HATNet Project (Hungarian Automated Telescope Network) using telescopes at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins in Arizona and at the Submillimeter Array facility in Hawaii. It was confirmed and the orbital parameters determined by radial velocity measurements made at the 8.2 m Subaru and 10 m Keck telescopes, the discovery announcement being made on September 14, 2006.
Orbit and mass.
HAT-P-1b is located in a very close orbit to its star, taking only 4.47 days to complete. It therefore falls into the category of hot Jupiters. At only 8.27 million kilometers from the star, tidal forces would circularise the orbit unless another perturbing body exists in the system. At the present time, the existing measurements are not sufficient to determine the orbital eccentricity, so a perfectly circular orbit has been assumed by the discoverers. However, the eccentricity of the planet was calculated to be no greater than 0.067.
In order to determine the mass of the planet, measurements of the star's radial velocity variations were made by the N2K Consortium. This was done by observing the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. Combined with the known inclination of the orbit as determined by the transit observations, this revealed the mass of the planet to be 0.53±0.04 times that of Jupiter.
Rotation.
As of August 2008, the most recent calculation of HAT-P-1b's Rossiter–McLaughlin effect and so spin-orbit angle was 3.7°.
Characteristics.
As evidenced by its high mass and planetary radius, HAT-P-1b is a gas giant, most likely composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. The emission from C2, CN and CH radicals in planetary atmosphere was detected in 2022. The planetary atmosphere is hazy rather than cloudy, with observed clouds area fraction 22 percent.
Current theories predict that such planets formed in the outer regions of their solar systems and migrated inwards to their present orbits.
HAT-P-1b is significantly larger than predicted by theoretical models. This may indicate the presence of an additional source of heat within the planet. One possible candidate is tidal heating from an eccentric orbit, a possibility which has not been ruled out from the available measurements. However, another planet with a significantly inflated radius, HD 209458 b, is in a circular orbit.
An alternative possibility is that the planet has a high axial tilt, like Uranus in the Solar System. The problem with this explanation is that it is thought to be quite difficult to get a planet into this configuration, so having two such planets among the set of known transiting planets is problematic.

White Cloud Temple

The White Cloud Temple, also known as Baiyun Temple or the Abbey or Monastery of the White Clouds, is a Taoist temple and monastery located in Beijing, China. It is one of "The Three Great Ancestral Courts" of the Quanzhen School of Taoism and is titled "The First Temple under Heaven".
History.
The White Cloud Temple was first founded in the mid-8th century during the Tang dynasty and was initially called the Temple of Heavenly Perpetuity ("Tianchang Guan"). During this period, the abbey was state-sponsored and staffed by an elite clergy. From 1125 to 1215 when what is now Beijing was controlled by the Jin dynasty, the abbey served as the Taoist administrative headquarters and played an important role in state ceremonies. After Beijing was taken by the Mongols in 1215, the abbey was taken over by the Quanzhen patriarch Qiu Chuji and became the headquarters of the Quanzhen movement until the establishment of the Ming dynasty. Qiuwho himself was known by the name Master of Eternal Springrenamed the abbey the Palace of Eternal Spring ("Changchun Gong"). Upon being summoned by Genghis Khan, Qiu undertook a three-year trek from Shandong to give the great khan an exposition on Taoism, which he completed in October 1222. Qiu's successor, Yin Zhiping (; 1169–1251) built a memorial shrine over Qiu's grave. This shrine became a temple in its own right and became known as the White Cloud Temple. The abbey was damaged when the Mongols took over in the late 13th century and, during the Ming dynasty, the Palace of Eternal Spring was destroyed. However, the White Cloud Temple survived and took over the functions of its former parent. Under the Ming, clergy from the Zhengyi school took over operations of the abbey but continued Quanzhen traditions and ordination ceremonies. Zhengyi control over the temple continued until the 17th century, when their monopoly ended and the Quanzhen master Wang Changyue (; d.1680) took over. To this day, the White Cloud Temple remains controlled by the Quanzhen school. The abbey was without an abbot for the 1940s and was closed when the communists came to power in 1949. Unlike many other historical sites which were being destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, the White Cloud Temple managed to survived but was also damaged. Today, it is again a fully functioning temple and is the seat of the Chinese Taoist Association. 
Layout.
Like most other Chinese temples, the White Cloud Temple is laid out on a north-south axis, with the entrance at the south end. There are five main halls built upon the main axis, beginning with the Main Gate, Yuhuang Hall , "Hall of the Jade Emperor"), Laolü Hall ), Qiuzu Hall (, "Hall of the Venerable Qiu"), and finally the Sanqing Hall , "Hall of the Three Pure Ones"). On either side of the main axis are two smaller axes, each containing halls dedicated to a variety of deities. In the rear of the complex is a garden which hosts the abbey’s ordination platform.
Yuhuang Hall.
This hall was first built in 1661 and was rebuilt in 1788. It is dedicated to the Jade Emperor, who oversees the Celestial Bureaucracy in Chinese religion. It is three bays long with a gabled roof, and is flanked by drum and bell towers.
Laolü Hall.
This hall has the same design as the Yuhuang Hall and was first built in 1456. The monastic community holds a twice-daily office in the Laolü Hall, and it is where ordination certificates are issued.
Qiuzu Hall.
Originally built to enshrine Qiu Chuji, this hall was first built in 1228. It is three bays long with a front gallery.
Sanqing Hall.
In 1428, the Sanqing hall was built. It is a two-story, five bay structure with a gabled roof that contains statues of the Three Pure Ones on the top floor and the Four Celestial Aides on the bottom floor.
Ordinations.
Out of 20 Quanzhen ordination seminaries in the Qing dynasty, the White Cloud Temple was the most important of all. In order to become a Taoist monk of Quanzhen Order, novices first had to spend three years living in a temple. After accomplishing this, they were eligible to be ordained. The ordination was extremely harsh. Each novice had to undergo 100 days of brutal training that sometimes resulted in death. In modern times, this has been reduced to 53 days and is no longer as dangerous. After this training period, novices had exams on Taoist classics, poetry, and precepts. Afterwards, successful novices were fully ordained as Taoist monks. During the Qing dynasty, an average of 200 novices were ordained every four years. Ordination ceremonies ended after 1927, but were resumed in 1989.
Festivals.
Every year on the 19th day of the first lunar month a festival is held at the abbey in celebration of Qiu Chuji's birthday. It has been thought that Qiu would return to earth as an immortal on this day. The festival was first held during the Yuan dynasty, but was suspended after the People's Republic of China was established in 1949. The festival was revived in the 1990s and continues to be held to this day.

Rope pump

A rope pump is a type of pump that uses a loose-hanging rope, which is lowered into a well and drawn up through a long pipe, with its bottom end submerged in water. Round disks or knots, matching the diameter of the pipe, are attached to the rope, allowing water to be pulled to the surface. The rope pump is commonly used in developing countries for both community water supply and self-supply. It can be installed on boreholes or hand-dug wells, providing an affordable and efficient water-lifting solution.
Description.
A rope pump is a type of pump of which the main or most visible component is a continuous piece of rope, in which the rope is integral in raising water from a well. Rope pumps are often used in developing areas, the most common design of which uses PVC pipe and a rope with flexible or rigid valves. Rope pumps are cheap to build and easy to maintain. One design of rope pump using a solar-powered rope pump can pump 3,000 litres to 15 meters per day using an 80 watt solar panel. Rope pumps can be powered by low speed gasoline/diesel engines, electricity, human energy, wind and solar energy.
History.
Washer or chain pumps were used by the Chinese over 1000 years ago. In the 1980s Reinder van Tijen an inventor and grass roots activist, with the support of the "Royal Tropical Institute" of Amsterdam, created and began instructing various communities around the world how to make a rope pump from simple available parts using PVC pipes and plastic moldings. He began at Burkina Faso in Africa, continued to Tunisia, Thailand and Gambia among others. In Nicaragua, the technology was introduced around 1985 and by 2010 there were an estimated 70,000 pumps installed. An estimated 20,000 were installed on wells for rural communal water supply and over 25% of the rural water supply was with rope pumps. The other 50,000 pumps were installed on private wells of rural families and farmers, partly or completely paid for by families themselves, (so called Self-supply). Many rope pumps are now being replaced by electric pumps so families climb "the water ladder". It is also used in other parts of Central America with over 25,000 pumps installed to date. In Africa the improved model of the rope pump was introduced around 1995 but in many countries failed due to the use of outdated designs and lack of long term follow up on quality in production and installation. By the 2020 an estimated 5 million people in 20 countries worldwide were using rope pumps for domestic uses and small scale irrigation.
Construction.
The original rope pumps used knots along the rope length but can be made with flexible or rigid valves on the rope instead of knots. Alternatively they may use only rope, simply relying on the water clinging to the rope as it is quickly pulled to the surface.
Flexible valve rope pumps.
Flexible valves can be made from cut pieces of bicycle wheel tubing. The valves are positioned approximately 20 cm apart on the rope. One disadvantage of flexible valve rope pumps is that they must be appropriately sized and thickness for different types, sizes and length of pipes.
Rigid valve rope pump.
Rigid valves using plastic or metal washers that fit tightly into the PVC pipe as the rope is dragged through are also used. If the fit is tight, the washers can be spaced up to half a meter apart. The deeper the well, the smaller the pipe inner diameter must be, given the available power constraints. These rope pumps are often worked with a hand crank
Valves can also be made from knots in the rope itself.
Valveless rope pumps.
Valveless pumps rely on friction with water clinging to the rope, which is moved at high speed, often using a bicycle to produce the required speed. It is a less efficient design but is simpler to construct than the other rope pumps.
Intellectual property.
Rope pump technology is in the public domain and there are no patents pending on it.

<doc id="6997105" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6997105" title="MedicAlert">
MedicAlert

The MedicAlert Foundation is a non-profit company founded in 1956 and headquartered in Turlock, California. It maintains a database of members' medical information that is made available to medical authorities in the event of a medical emergency. Members supply critical medical data to the organization and receive a distinctive metal bracelet or necklace tag which is worn at all times. It can be used by first responders, such as emergency medical personnel or law-enforcement agents, to access wearers' medical history and special medical needs.
The name "MedicAlert" may be interpreted either as the two separate words "medic alert" or as a blended form of the phrase "medical alert".
Protocol and publicity.
The MedicAlert IDs worn by members are designed to mimic regular jewelry (such as bracelets, necklaces, ID tags, etc.) with the addition of the distinctive MedicAlert engraved tag. The personalized jewelry bears the words "Medic Alert" and the Staff of Asclepius, the universal symbol of the medical profession, on the obverse side, and important medical information and a personalized MedicAlert ID number on the back of the tag. Medical personnel can call the MedicAlert 24-hour Emergency Hotline and provide the ID number on the back of the ID to get more detailed medical information on the member.
Members' conditions and allergies are reviewed by medically trained staff and prioritized in the order of importance that an emergency health professional would assess a patient. The prioritized conditions are then transferred onto a members emblem and wallet card, while more detailed information is contained at MedicAlert ready to pass on in an emergency situation.
While IDs may change depending on country and availability, the two main MedicAlert IDs are bracelets and necklaces, the former being the most popular. MedicAlert has teamed up with Citizen Watch Co. to provide a line of watches that include the Citizen Watch Co. Eco-Drive watch with the customized engraving and logo of MedicAlert.
In the 1980s the IDs were publicized in conjunction with the insurance industry, The Epilepsy Foundation, and The American Diabetes Association, amongst other foundations. Celebrities also participated in the campaign (including comedian Carol Burnett, whose bracelet is symbolically the one-millionth).
Common medical conditions.
The medical conditions and prescriptions covered include, but are not limited to:
The MedicAlert Foundation of Australia permits organ donation directions to be engraved on their IDs.
Advance directives.
An advance directive covers specific directives as to the course of treatment that is to be taken by caregivers should the patient be unable to give informed consent due to incapacity. Currently in the United States, MedicAlert will hold on to signed advance directives which can be provided to first responders and medical personnel when they contact MedicAlert. A common advance directive is a do not resuscitate order which states that member has requested that resuscitation should not be attempted if the member suffers cardiac or respiratory arrest.
International affiliates.
MedicAlert has international affiliates in nine countries.

Science International

Science International, later retitled What Will They Think of Next!, is a Canadian television series produced by the Global Television Network from 1976 to 1979. Each episode featured approximately 20 short segments on scientific developments and trivia, narrated by Joseph Campanella and Tiiu Leek for its initial seasons. Kerrie Keane replaced Leek later in the series run. The hosts also appeared on camera, usually with chromakey effects behind them such as animation. The format of the series alternated between filmed footage of new inventions and developments and limited-animation segments usually focusing on more off-beat developments. After the show was retitled for its second and third seasons, Campanella proclaimed at the end of the opening credits that the reports originated from the "Research Unit of Science International."
In the US, this series aired in the early-1980s on Nickelodeon, with almost all episodes airing under the "What Will They Think of Next!" title; however, Nickelodeon did air some episodes under the "Science International" title.

Berno of Cluny

Saint Berno of Cluny (French: "Bernon") or Berno of Baume (c. 850 – 13 January 927) was the first abbot of Cluny from its foundation in 909 until he died in 927. He began the tradition of the Cluniac reforms which his successors spread across Europe.
Berno was first a monk at St. Martin's Abbey, Autun, and then at Baume Abbey about 886. In 890, he founded the monastery of Gigny on his own estates, and others at Bourg-Dieu and Massay. In 910, William I of Aquitaine, founder of Cluny, nominated him abbot of the new foundation. Berno placed the monastery under the Benedictine rule (founded by Benedict of Nursia and reformed by Benedict of Aniane).
He resigned as abbot in 925, his abbeys being divided between his relative Vido and his disciple Odo of Cluny.
He is regarded as a saint, with his feast day on 13 January.
Background.
St Benedict of Nursia had founded his famous monastery at Monte Cassino in the 5th century, and from it, his ideas and his Rule would come to influence western European monasticism. However, many monasteries were established by teutonic feudal lords intending to retire there at the end of their lives. They tended to relax observance of the Rule according to convenience. Matins were scheduled so as not interrupt sleep. There were no fixed rules on fasting, and it was left to the individual. Many monasteries became like fiefdoms, passed on through the family. Viewed as simply part of the founder's possessions, they could be divided up in inheritance as well. Benedict's rule had provided that the Abbot should be chosen by the monks, but the feudal lord assumed that right. Monks regarded the abbot like a feudal chieftain, and upon his death felt free to leave.
Charlemagne became interested in monasticism because of the opportunities for learning and the preservation of books. He supported the institution, but from the perspective of culture and education. Louis the Pious, Charlemagne's son, commissioned Benedict of Aniane to reform monasticism within the Carolingian empire, to return to what Benedict of Nursia had originally intended. It was decided that the Rule of St Benedict would be enforced in all monasteries, and Benedict of Aniane was given the task of interpreting it and outlining how it should be practiced.
Viking raids of the 9th and 10th centuries left monasteries of Western Europe in great disorder. Buildings suffered destruction and communities had fled seeking safety. Abbeys that survived were often under the control of lay overlords who retained any revenues for themselves. Monks in many abbeys lived in poverty or left. Bishops meeting in 909 in the diocese of Soissons, received reports of lay abbots living in monasteries with their families, guards, and dogs.
It was in this context that Berno of Cluny lived. Berno was concerned with reforming of the monasteries in accordance with the original Rule of St Benedict. He founded a monastery on his own land, and after the fame of his good administration of that monastery spread, he was asked to reform other monasteries as well.
Abbot of Baume.
Berno was born about the year 850 to a noble family in Burgundy. His father may have been the French nobleman Odon, who gave a refuge for the Benedictine community from Glanfeuil Abbey after the monks had been driven from the monastery by Norman attacks in 862. Berno joined the Benedictine Abbey of St. Martin at Autun, where Hugh of Anzy le Duc had introduced stricter adherence to the Rule of Saint Benedict. Later, Berno was sent to restore the monastery of Baume-les-Messieurs in the diocese of Besançon, which had fallen into neglect.
In 890 he established, with his own funds, the monastery of St. Peter at Gigny in the Jura Mountains and became its first abbot. In this he was supported by Rudolph I of Burgundy In 894, Berno travelled to Rome and got papal approval for the charter of Gigny. The monasteries at Gigny and Baume followed the rule as interpreted by Benedict of Aniane, who had sought to restore the primitive strictness of the monastic observance wherever it had been relaxed. The rule focused on prayer, silence, and solitude.
Another account states that Berno was sent to Baume by Abbot Hugh of Autun. This monastery prospered and many monks came there to take vows. His reputation for holiness grew, and he was then asked to take over the leadership of Baume in order to reform it. Berno thus became abbot of Baume and restored this monastery's former reputation for holiness, A second story is supported by later charters that show Baume was dependent upon Gigny. However, it is also possible that Berno took over Gigny's leadership after being abbot of Baume, rather than the other way around.
Founding of Cluny.
It was common at this time that monasteries would be founded with patrons who would provide the financial capital needed to create and sustain the monastery, and in return for the monks prayers.
One account states that when Berno was abbot of Baume, he had such a good reputation, that William of Aquitaine gave him the monasteries at Deols and Massay. William was acquainted with Berno when he was abbot of Baume, and was supportive of the reformers who wanted to bring monasticism back to a stricter observance of the Benedictine rule. The Duke wanted to found a new monastery and asked Berno to be abbot. One story holds that when William asked Berno where the monastery should be founded, Berno asked the Duke to donate his favourite hunting lodge in Cluny; thereby making a sacrifice on his own part. The Duke protested and said, "Impossible, I cannot have my dogs removed“， and Berno then answered, "Drive out the dogs and put monks in their place, for thou canst well think what reward God will give thee for dogs, and what for monks." William gave part of his fiefdom of Cluny to Berno for the monastery. The founding of the monastery is dated to 11 September 909.
William guaranteed that the monastery would be free from control by him, his successors or any other temporal power, and it was placed under the direct authority of the Pope in Rome, who accepted Cluny's charter. This was very important for the later history of the abbey, because it meant that no local bishop, who himself might have been against Cluny's Benedictine reform movement within the church, had the authority to stop Cluny from carrying out its work, since Cluny was under the protection of the Pope. 
The Benedictine rule was to be strictly followed. Cluny in return would pay a sum of 10 solidi of gold every five years to the Pope. Anyone who violated the charter that placed Cluny under Rome, was to be subject to a terrible curse including eternal hellfire. The apostles Peter and Paul were called upon to be the guardians of Cluny.
Berno's Death.
Berno administered six monasteries by the time he died, which were at Gigny, Baume, the abbey of Aethicens with the cella of St Lautenus, Deols, Massay and Cluny. Before he died he gave three monasteries, namely Gigny, Baume and Aethicens to one of his monks named Wido, and the other three he gave to another monk named Odo (later St Odo of Cluny). He urged his monks on his deathbed to continue to stay true to the Benedictine Rule, which had been so often violated by many other monasteries, and to follow all the rules regarding silence, food and drink, ritual, and most importantly the abandonment of personal possessions.
After Berno died, Wido attempted to take Cluny away from Odo, but Pope John X intervened in Odo's favour in the year 928.

<doc id="6997129" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6997129" title="Nagasaki University">
Nagasaki University

 is a national university of Japan. Its nickname is "Chōdai" (). The main campus is located in Bunkyo-machi, Nagasaki City, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan.
History.
Nagasaki University was established in 1949 by incorporating several national institutions, namely, Nagasaki Medical College (including College Hospital and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences), Nagasaki College of Economics, Nagasaki Normal School, Nagasaki Youth Normal School and Nagasaki High School.
The new main campus (Bunkyo Campus) was formerly a plant site of Mitsubishi Arms Factory (Ohashi Plant).
Nagasaki Medical College.
The oldest of the predecessors was Nagasaki Medical College. It was founded in November 1857 as by the branch office of Tokugawa Shogunate. The first professor was J. L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort, and the institute was one of the first western-style (not "Kampō") medical schools in Japan. In 1861 the hospital was founded, and after Meiji Restoration the school became a public (prefectural, later national) medical school. It was developed into in 1901, then into in 1923.
After Japan participated in the Pacific War, the medical college added several institutes for the war, such as Temporary College of Medicine (1940) and East Asia Research Institute of Endemics (1942, Institute of Tropical Medicine today). On August 9, 1945 the college was heavily damaged by the atomic bomb, because it was located only 500 to 700 meters away from the hypocenter. Over 800 professors, students and medical workers were killed. The college was moved to Omura in September 1945, and then to Isahaya in 1946. The old campus (Sakamoto Campus) was restored later in 1950, after the college was integrated into Nagasaki University.
Institute of Tropical Medicine.
The Institute of Tropical Medicine (長崎大学熱帯医学研究所], NEKKEN or NUITM) was originally founded under Nagasaki Medical College to perform basic and applied studies on endemic diseases in East Asia. In 1949, the institute merged with other facilities to form Nagasaki University under the new ruling of the National School Establishment Law.
Since 1946, researchers at NUITM have conducted fundamental and applied studies on tropical and emerging diseases. This includes infectious disease epidemiology studies and vaccine and therapeutics development against infectious diseases. Researchers at NUITM have established several international research partnerships, including in Vietnam the Philippines, and Kenya, to study emerging and re-emerging diseases. The institute has research stations in Vietnam and Kenya, and of note, the field research conducted in Kenya has inspired a popular song, novel, and charity foundation, and has been featured in a film, "The Lion Standing in the Wind".
As one of the world's leading institutes for training and research in tropical medicine and health care, it is stipulated as a Joint Usage/ Research Center under the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) to spear-head academic research, and is a member of the Japan Infectious Disease Research Consortium that includes Institute of Medical Science (Japan), Osaka University and Hokkaido University.
With over one hundred graduate students enrolled, NUITM carries out an extensive capacity strengthening program in counterpart countries, and collaborates with a large network of institutions in Africa, South America, and Asia through MEXT, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Official Development Assistance (Japan) (ODA), Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) and the WHO. The institute acts as a WHO Collaborating Center for Research and Reference of Tropical and Emerging Viral Diseases and as the WHO's reference laboratories, providing confirmatory testing for COVID-19. The institute also offers a Joint PhD Programme for Global Health as part of an academic partnership with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the institute led the International Infectious Disease Consortium against COVID-19 (grant-in-aid emergency fund), an international research collaboration to develop countermeasures against the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. 
Researchers at NUITM, in collaboration with local public health institutes, initiated efforts in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, including developing new diagnostic tools. Technology transfer and collaboration with Southeast Asian counterparts has shed light on how the disease spread in Japan and Southeast Asia.
Nagasaki College of Economics.
Another notable predecessor was Nagasaki College of Economics. It was founded in March 1905 as . It was the fourth national commercial college in Japan, after Tokyo (1887), Kobe (1902) and Yamaguchi (February 1905), and aimed at educating students so that they could engage in business with China, Korea and Southeast Asia. In 1917 it added the Advanced Course for Trade (one-year course), and the building for the course was built in 1919 (Keirin Hall today).
In 1944 it was renamed . On August 9, 1945 although Nagasaki underwent the atomic bombing, the college buildings were protected by Mt. Kompira. Its campus (Katafuchi Campus) has been used by the Faculty of Economics, Nagasaki University.
Controversy.
 In April 2019, Nagasaki University came under fire for banning smokers from their campus. This would prevent teachers from getting hired. Many smokers and non-smokers felt that the measure was discriminatory against smokers and their personal lives. Many also argued that smoking is not relevant to their employment.
Several people have filed lawsuits against the university for discrimination. However, no lawsuit has been currently settled.

Greensplat

Greensplat () is a location in south Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is in the civil parish of Treverbyn immediately west of Carthew and approximately north of St Austell.
Greensplat is situated in the china clay area and the name is believed to be derived from "Green's Plat", referring to a mine shaft nearby that was known as "the Plat". Greensplat is sometimes erroneously spelled Greensplatt.
History.
Until 1997 there was a settlement at Greensplat. However, due to expansion of the nearby Wheal Martyn china clay quarry the centre of Greensplat was entirely demolished. Most of the buildings were Victorian in period, with the exception of a few Georgian and earlier period cottages related to farming and tin streaming that took place prior to clay extraction. Until the Methodist chapel and adjoining Sunday School were demolished in 1997, Greensplat was still considered to be a village.
The former settlement was aligned on a north to south axis, and was roughly divided into three segments; north, central, and south, with the central area forming the bulk of the settlement. Greensplat was noted for its railway carriage homes which survived to be among those demolished. The last house to be demolished was "Kenwyn", a double fronted Victorian house—written on the building in red spray paint were the words "Kenwyn Do Not Demolish".
Following the demolition, the only remaining part of Greensplat is a semi-detached cottage at South Greensplat, which is the only inhabited building within quite a large area, surrounded by just under of uninhabited and abandoned land. The nearest inhabited settlements are at Old Pound to the west, Ruddlemoor to the east, and Carthew to the northeast.
The story of Greensplat's demolition is told in "The Lost Villages" by Henry Buckton published by I. B. Tauris &amp; Co Ltd, London, Feb 2008, .

Dominic Frontiere

Dominic Carmen Frontiere (June 17, 1931 – December 21, 2017) was an American composer, arranger, and jazz accordionist. He composed the theme and much of the music for the first season of the television series "The Outer Limits", as well as the theme song for "The Rat Patrol".
Biography.
Early years.
Born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of a musical family, at age seven Frontiere was already playing several instruments before deciding to concentrate on the accordion. At age twelve, he played a solo recital at Carnegie Hall.
Hollywood.
After a period with The Horace Heidt Orchestra in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Frontiere moved to Los Angeles, where he enrolled at University of California, Los Angeles. He eventually became musical director at 20th Century Fox. He scored several films under the tutelage of Alfred and Lionel Newman, while also recording jazz music. He composed the music for two exotica LP records "Pagan Festival" (1959) and "Love Eyes, The Mood of Romance" (1960).
An association with director and producer Leslie Stevens began with Frontiere scoring "The Marriage-Go-Round" (1961). This association led to several projects, such as his innovative blend of music and sound effects for "The Outer Limits". The relationship led Frontiere to became production manager and executive of television and film production company Daystar Productions, a company Stevens run. He composed several famous television themes of the 1960s, such as those for "The Rat Patrol", "Branded", "The Flying Nun", and for producer Quinn Martin "The Invaders", "The Fugitive", and "12 O'Clock High".
After scoring for television shows, he went on to compose the music for the Clint Eastwood film "Hang 'Em High". The title theme for that movie became a top-10 hit for the group Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s. He also composed the soundtrack to the 1971 motorcycle documentary "On Any Sunday", which featured Steve McQueen and was directed by Bruce Brown. He composed the scores of three films starring John Wayne, "Chisum" (1970), "The Train Robbers" (1973) and "Brannigan" (1975).
Frontiere became head of the music department at Paramount Pictures in the early 1970s, where he again worked on television and film scores, while concurrently orchestrating popular music albums for, among others, Chicago. Examples of Frontiere's sweeping, cinematic orchestrations appear in the opening and closing songs of the 1977 album "Nether Lands" by Dan Fogelberg. He won a Golden Globe Awards for the score to the 1980 film "The Stunt Man". He also composed a jingle for the studio's television division. Frontiere composed a theme for the lion Togar that was featured in the film "Roar". 
Tax evasion conviction.
In 1986, Frontiere was incarcerated for nine months in a federal penitentiary after scalping tickets to the 1980 Super Bowl, which he obtained through his then-wife, Los Angeles Rams owner Georgia Frontiere. He was estimated to have scalped as many as 16,000 tickets, making a half million dollars in profit that he did not report to the Internal Revenue Service. Frontiere pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year and one day in prison, three years probation, and fined $15,000 for failing to report income from the sale of the tickets and for lying to the IRS. Georgia Frontiere filed for divorce shortly after Dominic's release from prison.
Death.
Frontiere died on 21 December 2017, at the age of 86 in Tesuque, New Mexico, where he lived.

Amara Dunqas was the first ruler of the Kingdom of Sennar, which he ruled from 1504 - 1533/4. "Dunqas" is an epithet meaning "bent down, with an inclined head", referring to the way of how he required his subjects to approach him.
According to James Bruce, he founded the city of Sennar after the Wad 'Ajib had been defeated by the Funj in a battle near Arbaji. Doing this he moved the seat of government of Wad ‘Ajib to Arbaji, that he might be more immediately under their own eye. 
Following the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, Amara Dunqas skillfully used diplomacy to keep the Ottoman armies from advancing further up the Nile and conquering his realm, thus securing the future of the kingdom. Some sources suggest that Amara may have agreed to nominal tributary status or diplomatic recognition in exchange for autonomy. This allowed Sennar to remain effectively independent while giving the Ottomans a sense of regional control.
In 1523 the Jewish traveller David Reubeni passed through the territory of a king 'Amara, who is usually identified with Amara Dunqas. Two years later, Amara is briefly mentioned by the Ottoman admiral Selman Reis as the ruler of a kingdom, that, while described as requiring a three-month journey to cross it, was weak and hence easily conquerable.

Reese's pro career began in the Detroit organization and he appeared in 59 games for the Tigers in his final MLB season in 1973, but he spent the bulk of his big-league tenure—807 games played—as a member of the Twins, who drafted him away from the Tigers in November 1962. In his finest season, , Reese batted a career-best .322 in 132 games, with 16 home runs and 69 runs batted in, also personal bests. He tied for the American League lead in pinch hits with 13 in . He is also the co-holder of the major league record for pinch-hit grand slam home runs in a career with three. One of those pinch-hit slams, on August 3, 1969, snapped the Baltimore Orioles' Dave McNally's consecutive win streak at 17, one short of the American League record.
Reese is also in the record books for two strikeouts: as the final out in Catfish Hunter's perfect game on May 8, , and as Nolan Ryan's 383rd strikeout victim of the 1973 season (September 27), the still-standing single-season record, breaking Sandy Koufax's record of 382 in 1965.

Manuel de Almeida

Manuel de Almeida (sometimes Manoel de Almeida, 1580–1646) was a native of Viseu who entered at an early age into the Society of Jesus and went out as a missionary to India. He is noted to have travelled to Ethiopia and Eritrea and Lake Tana and built a number of churches and monasteries, particularly on the small islands of the lake.
In 1622, Almeida was selected by the general of his order as ambassador to the Emperor of Ethiopia, Susenyos. Accompanied by three companions, Almeida left Bassein 28 November of that year for Suakin, and reached Diu two months later; he was delayed at the port of Dhofar from 18 May 1623 to 16 October due to unfavorable winds. At last Almeida departed for Suakin, reaching it 4 December, where he received a pass from the local Pasha to pass through the territories of the Ottoman Empire. He then found passage to Massawa, whence he made his way to Fremona by way of Debarwa (where he met the governor of Tigray, "Ras" Keba Krestos), reaching the Catholic base in January 1624.
He was well received by Emperor Susenyos, but his successor Fasilides first exiled him and his fellow Jesuits to Fremona in 1633. Almeida was selected, along with Manoel Barradas and two other priests, to return to Goa and seek help from the Portuguese authorities for the missionaries; however, he made slow progress and by the time he reached Diu, most of his fellow Jesuits, who had been subsequently expelled from the country, had caught up with him. Upon returning to India, after thirteen years' absence, Almeida was made provincial of his order, and inquisitor. There he died.
Almeida wrote a history of Ethiopia, "Historia de Etiopía a Alta ou Abassia", which drew on his own experiences as well as the writings of previous missionaries like Pedro Páez. The "Historia" was never published during Almeida's lifetime; but an abridgment and partial revision of Almeida's work by Baltazar Téllez was printed at Coimbra in 1660; an anonymous translation of Tellez's work into English appeared in 1710. Selections from "Historia" work were translated into English by C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford and published in "Some Records of Ethiopia, 1593-1646" (London: Hakluyt Society, 1954).

Chiefland Middle-High School

Chiefland Middle High School is a public high school in Chiefland, Florida. It is a part of the District School Board of Levy County.
History.
The school was founded in 1922 with only ten students in grade nine, thus meeting the required minimum. An additional grade was added in each of the subsequent three years and the first graduating class, composed of just five students, was the "Class of 1926".
In 1931 what is now the main building of Chiefland High School was erected. The brick schoolhouse at Hardeetown was moved to the site in 1932 and served for a time as a lunchroom. Later it was renovated to serve as the industrial arts shop and finally in 1979 was moved to its present location to become the Chiefland Community Center.
Using WPA labor in 1940, an agricultural building was added, which served until 1978, at which time a new structure replaced it. A library was built in 1961 and was expanded to double its size in 1978. Original structures still in use include the gymnasium constructed in 1966, succeeded by the addition of a multi-purpose building in 1967. These projects were followed by the auto mechanics building in 1969, the cafeteria in 1971, the special education building in 1973, and, finally, by the masonry building in 1974.
In 1975 Chiefland High School began using two additions that were originally built as part of the Chiefland Elementary School. The first L-shaped building constructed in 1954 consisted of four classrooms and two restrooms. Later that year a second phase added another classroom and a boiler room. In 1964 three additional classrooms and the walkway to the library were completed.
In July 2013, the School Board of Levy County officially designated Chiefland High School as a middle-high school. Furthermore, known as Chiefland Middle High School.

Soldier Key

Soldier Key is an island in Biscayne National Park in Miami-Dade County, Florida. It is located between Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, about three miles north of the Ragged Keys, five miles south of Cape Florida on Key Biscayne, seven-and-a-half miles east of the mainland and three miles west of Fowey Rocks. It lies on the Safety Valve, a sand bar that separates Biscayne Bay from the Atlantic Ocean and moderates storm surges into the bay.
Geography.
The island is small, about 200 yards (200 meters) by 100 yards (100 meters) with a maximum elevation of six feet (under two meters). It is at the southern end of the along-shore movement of sand that feeds the barrier islands to the North (such as Key Biscayne) and is the northernmost exposure of the Key Largo limestone (fossilized coral reef) which forms the "true" Florida Keys. The island is covered by grass and shrub vegetation typical of the Florida Keys. Although the island was described as "thickly wooded" in 1894, as of 1955 the only wooded areas were mangroves on the fringes of the island. Also as of 1955, there were several buildings on the island, and a boat slip protected by jetties.
History.
Earlier names for the island include: "La Parida y su Figulo", "La Parida y su Hijos", "Laurence Key", "Little Soldier Key", "Oswald Island" and "Parida".
Current charts show a single key at this location, but many early maps &amp; charts show at least two.
In 1989/1990 a Fort Lauderdale Entertainment conglomerate unveiled plans to partner with a day cruise company and begin selling day trips to Soldier Key. This would have required dredging the bay bottom, creating an artificial beach, building tiki huts and concession stands, electrifying and plumbing the island. A group of locals began a grassroots protest, collecting hundreds of signatures of boycotting customers. They held a regatta protest in which twenty or so boats showed up. This was the day the ground war started in the first Gulf War, so their protest action was lost in the news out of Iraq. They ultimately prevailed and the plans for developing Soldier Key were abandoned.

Colt Double Eagle

The Colt Double Eagle was a double-action / single action, semi-automatic pistol manufactured by Colt's Manufacturing Company between 1989 and 1997. It was available in standard full-size, as well as in more compact versions. It featured a decocking lever, and was chambered for several calibers. The family of models was known as the Series 90.
The design of the Double Eagle was based on the Colt M1911 pistol. Magazines are single stack and are identical to magazines shipped with the M1911. Most of the Double Eagle models were available in stainless steel only, however the "Lightweight" Officer's had an alloy frame and blued slide.
Ron Smith of Smith Enterprise, Inc. was the main designer of the double action mechanism.
The slide used a version of Colt's series 80 locking firing pin safety, but unlike Colt's series 80 pistols, the Double Eagle Officer's model in .45 ACP held an 8-round magazine.
Variations.
The Double Eagle was chambered for several calibers; among the more common are .45 ACP and 10mm Auto. Occasionally, one will see a copy in .40 S&amp;W, 9×19mm Parabellum, and .38 Super. Similar to the M1911, Colt offered, in addition to the full-sized version, the more compact Commander and Officer versions. The full-sized version was chambered for .45 ACP and 10mm Auto, as well as in 9mm and .38 Super for a time in 1992. The Commander was chambered for .45 ACP, along with a somewhat rare .40 S&amp;W version in 1992. The Officer's model was available in .45 ACP and rarely .40 S&amp;W, again only in 1992. Colt eventually redesigned the trigger mechanism and added a retaining plate due to some shooters having problems with skin being pinched by the top part of the trigger, as well as some springs only being retained by the grip panel. The result was the Double Eagle Mark II.

You're Not Singing Any More

"You're Not Singing Any More" is a football chant in the UK used by the supporters of a team towards the other team's fans who have become silent for one reason or another, such as because they have just conceded a goal or had a player sent off.
It was used in an episode of the BBC television programme "The Green Green Grass" when Boycie found out that Elgin got less money than he expected in the "Antiques Roadshow". It was also chanted by Mrs. Doyle and her friends during a football match in the Channel 4 "Father Ted" episode "Escape from Victory".
It was recently sung, in a rare cricket context, after Ben Stokes had brought about a historic and unlikely victory over Australia in the third Ashes test at Headingley in August of 2019, when the majority English crowd on the Western Terrace taunted the small Australian contingent. 
The chant is simply that phrase repeated several times to the second half of the Welsh hymn tune "Cwm Rhondda".
An alternative version sung to the same tune is "Shall We Sing a Song for You?", which is also used when opposing fans have gone quiet.

BMW R32

The BMW R32 was the first motorcycle produced by BMW under the BMW name. An aircraft engine manufacturer during World War I, BMW was forced to diversify after the Treaty of Versailles banned the German air force and German aircraft manufacture. BMW initially turned to industrial engine design and manufacturing.
History.
In 1919, BMW designed and manufactured the flat-twin M2B15 engine for Victoria Werke AG of Nuremberg. The engine was initially intended as a portable industrial engine, but found its main use in Victoria motorcycles. The engine was also used in the Helios motorcycle built by Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, which was later merged into BMW AG. Bayerische Flugzeugwerke also manufactured a small two-stroke engined motorcycle, called the Flink, which was not successful.
After the merger, General Director of BMW Franz Josef Popp asked Design Director Max Friz to assess the Helios motorcycle. Upon completing his assessment, Friz suggested to Popp that the best thing that could be done with the Helios would be to dump it in the nearest lake. More specifically, Friz condemned the Douglas-style transverse-crankshaft layout, which heavily restricted the cooling of the rear cylinder. 
Popp and Friz then agreed to a near-term solution of redesigning the Helios to make it more saleable and a long-term solution of an all new motorcycle design. This new design was designated the BMW R32 and began production in 1923, becoming the first motorcycle to be badged as a BMW.
The M2B33 engine in the R32 had a displacement of 494 cc and had a cast-iron sidevalve cylinder/head unit. The engine produced , which propelled the R32 to a top speed of . 
The engine and gear box formed a single unit. The new engine featured a recirculating wet sump oiling system at a time when most motorcycle manufacturers used a total-loss oiling system. 
BMW used this type of recirculating oiling system until 1969.
To counter the cooling problems encountered with the Helios, Friz oriented the R32's M2B33 boxer engine with the cylinder heads projecting out on each side for cooling, 
as used in the earlier British-manufactured ABC. Unlike the ABC, however, the R32 used shaft final drive from a flexible coupling on the gearbox output shaft to a pinion driving a ring gear on the rear wheel hub.
The R32 had a tubular steel frame with twin downtubes that continued under the engine to the rear wheel. The front fork had a trailing link design suspended by a leaf spring, similar to the forks used by Indian at the time. The rear wheel was rigidly mounted. In the original First Series, braking was accomplished solely with a "dummy rim" on the rear wheel with two padded brake shoes set within it. One would be operated by the, now traditional, right hand lever and the other by use of a heel actuated lever on the right side. Later years would reroute the front right lever and cable to a front drum brake.
Legacy.
The R32 established the boxer-twin, shaft-drive powertrain layout that BMW would use until the present. BMW used shaft drives in all of its motorcycles until the introduction of the F650 in 1994 and continues to use it on their boxer-twin motorcycles.

Olympic Club Hotel

The Olympic Club Hotel, also known as McMenamins Olympic Club, is a historic hotel owned by McMenamins Pubs &amp; Breweries in Centralia, Washington, United States and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
History.
Built in 1908, the Olympic Club Hotel was originally known as the Oxford Hotel and contained a bar and pool hall. The club was severely damaged in a fire in 1913 but was rebuilt. Notorious train robber Roy Gardner, known as the "Gentleman Bandit", was re-captured at the then-Oxford Hotel after escaping federal custody in 1921.
The historic location was purchased by the McMenamin brothers, acquiring the property in 1996 and reopening the Olympic Club the following year; McMenamins was added to the Olympic Club moniker to reflect the new ownership. The club was remodeled in 2002 with the addition of a movie theater; the entirety of the venue, including the bar, hotel, and dining area were combined under the McMenamins Olympic Club name.
Architecture and features.
The Olympic Club accommodates a bar and restaurant within a pool hall setting that contains original, vintage decor. The mahogany bar is decorated with original Tiffany stained glass lamps and is host to two antique cash registers. The mixed use dining and pool hall area contains the original Olympic Club pool tables, restored during the 2002 remodel. The site also hosts a private Green Room, an outdoor patio, and a brewery.
The location also includes a brewpub movie house, known as the Olympic Club Theater, which was once a clothing store and billiards room. The theater is decorated with a tin ceiling, velvet couches, and various forms of art including photos of notorious guests. Film showings are free for guests. and food and drink service is provided during screenings.
The hotel portion of the Olympic Club, located above the bar and dining area, was once used as a brothel and contains 27 "European-style" rooms, going without such modern amenities as telephones or televisions. Each room is named after historic visitors or prior employees of great contribution. The basement is suspected to have been used for bootlegging and may contain tunnels leading to the nearby historic Centralia Union Depot.
The Olympic Club hosts musical acts as part of the McMenamin chain's "Great Northwest Music Tour," mostly consisting of bands from the Portland, Oregon area.
Significance.
The original portion of the Olympic Club, as it existed at the time, was added to the NRHP and the Washington State Heritage Register on March 10, 1980.

Azores Liberation Front

The Azores Liberation Front, more commonly known as the FLA () is a right-wing paramilitary organization with the goal of forceful independence of the Azores, appearing right after the Carnation Revolution and whose actions included violent attacks on political opponents in 1975. It has remained a dormant organization since, with occasional press releases on political issues of the islands.
In 2006 Rui Medeiros became president of the group, and has stated in a 2016 interview that the group is no longer pursuing violent means. Medeiros claims that the group has a membership in the hundreds. The founder of the group, José de Almeida, died in 2014.
History.
The FLA was founded by José de Almeida in London, on April 8, 1975. Almeida, a former representative of the Acção Nacional Popular (English: "Popular National Action Party") in the National Assembly, modeled his actions on the Madeira Archipelago Liberation Front (FLAMA).
In the beginning, the movement was responsible for violent intimidation tactics groups or organizations counter to their own political sensibilities.Although it was supported by the local merchants and entrepreneurs on the island of São Miguel, fearful of the possible nationalization of businesses, the group was sociologically popular with the agrarian-classes on the island, having its origin in the seigneur system of inheritances that had existed in the archipelago during its settlement. There was some fear that the lean towards socialism on the continent would result in the loss of land rights and personal possessions in a presumed collectivization. As the Portuguese communist party accumulated more power, fear of Portugal becoming a pro-Soviet puppet state started to grow and was nourished by the right-wing political movements. Around the same time, the tumultuous transition to democracy (with its nationalization policies) became very unpopular among Azorean farmers and industrialists, mostly from São Miguel island who organized themselves to resist the "red danger".
From an economic perspective, the FLA based their success on a future re-negotiation of the air base lease in Lajes, Terceira and the use of geothermal energy to maintain their local economy, during the initial isolation following a declaration of independence and economic support from the Azorean diaspora. 
Even though the organization gained some support for some time, it was virtually dead by the end of the 70's. Autonomy was granted to the Azores and Madeira (where a similar organization existed, the Madeira Archipelago Liberation Front) by the Constitution of 1976, cooling the explosive situation, and the communist threat was slowly eroding.

José de Almeida attempted repeatedly to negotiate with the U.S. Department of State, in order to gauge support for Azorean independence in the administration. Unfortunately for the FLA, after November 25th the proposal was rejected by the administration as unrealistic. covert actions of the Frente de Libertação dos Açores were possible, though, through nascent support.
Protest.
Members of the FLA in Ponta Delgada, along with right-leaning members of the PPD and CDS and property-owners hoping to cause a change in government policy, associated with price of milk, meat, canned goods and potential agrarian reform, organized a protest on the 6 June 1975. Rapidly, the protest degenerated and the crowd marched on the Palace of Conceição, to demand the resignation of Civil Governor António Borges Coutinho, with cries of "Viva a Independência" and "A FLA basta para o MFA" heard. The Military Governor, General Altino Pinto de Magalhães did not intervene in the protests and the Governor resigned. What became known as the Micalense Farmers' Protest was the first political success for the members of the Front, but was short-lived: within a period of 24 hours members of the FLA, as well as sympathizers, were rounded-up throughout the islands and imprisoned. They were eventually released and prosecutions were dropped through lack of evidence. The protests would lead to the establishment of the Regional Junta of the Azores.
On 12 August, members of the FLA stated that the movement would use violence in order to obtain its objectives of an independent archipelago. The group then approved several internal motions to force the transfer of members of the PCP and their sympathizers (including a parish priest) off the islands. Already, the movement had created a military wing, during a meeting in the Canaries, even as they had indicated their desire to abandon the armed struggle if Portugal followed the Grupo dos Nove. A day later (19 August 1975) the headquarters of the PCP in Ponta Delgada and PCP MDP/CDE and MES in Angra do Heroísmo were destroyed.
By 21 October, the FLA was denounced by their critics as acting with impunity on the islands of Terceira and São Miguel, with the support of civil and military authorities. Around this time the FLA's manifesto was proclaimed across the Radio Clube in Angra, resulting in some citizens banding together to create an "Esquadrão da Noite" for self-defense against the FLA.
Decline and subsequent revival.
Even though the organization gained support for some time, it entered a state of dormancy beginning in the late 1970s. Autonomy was granted to the Azores and Madeira (where a similar organization existed) by the Constitution of 1976, cooling the explosive situation, and the communist threat slowly eroded. The geo-political strategic importance of the Azores continues to be debated by regional and international interests. The FLA elected a new president in 2006, Rui Medeiros. The group began to make press statements regarding various political issues on the islands. Medeiros stated in an interview that "armed combat today would make no sense," and wishes for the group to be represented as a political party. It is still a clandestine organization, and has not disclosed its membership numbers, though Medeiros claimed that the FLA consists of "hundreds" of members.
Owing to economic issues resulting from the Portuguese financial crisis, during the late 20th century and early 21st century, "FLA" graffiti began to appear in many of the islands of the archipelago. Although not a political support of the party, the graffiti was seen as an anti-establishment instigation by youth and party faithful.

Edgewood, Atlanta

Edgewood is a neighborhood located on the east side of Atlanta, Georgia, United States, located approximately east of downtown Atlanta.
History.
Originally called Hardeville, after the area's largest landowner, William J. Hardee. The area became popular when a 
train depot for the Georgia Railroad, was built near Clifton Rd and Dekalb Ave.
The name Edgewood was first mentioned in 1879 by the Soles Gazette. The article goes on to describe the burgeoning town and the people who lived there. The town was that of the blue collar worker, with a large African American population, the streets lined with American Craftsman style homes contrasting the Victorian Architecture of the Kirkwood and Candler Park neighborhoods. Edgewood was annexed into Atlanta in 1909. In return the neighborhood's infrastructure, was heavily upgraded. Edgewood was developed during Atlanta’s Reconstruction-era economic boom from 1870 to 1910. The population boom led to the further development of the neighborhood. Companies like Cotton Seed Oil and Virginia Chemical developing in what is now Carlye Park. By the 1920's Edgewood's popularity was booming due to the rise of the streetcar in Atlanta. Affluent families were coming to Edgewood for the convenient travel time from downtown and stayed for the lively community. In the 20's, Coca-Cola's Asa Candler took a vested interest in the community. Candler took to developing the northern part of the neighborhood, going as far as to donate the land that now holds the Candler Park Golf Course and fighting for the creation of the Mary Lin Elementary School.
Geography.
While the entire Atlanta-in-DeKalb area is sometimes called "east Atlanta," the neighborhood of East Atlanta is to the south-southeast of Edgewood. Kirkwood is immediately to the east of Edgewood, with Reynoldstown just to the west, and Candler Park to the north.
While Edgewood Avenue was named for Edgewood and stretches from downtown Atlanta in the direction of Edgewood, the avenue does not quite reach the neighborhood.
Commercial district.
The Edgewood Retail District is a 44 acre (17.6-hectare) mixed-use village located off Moreland Avenue, on the fringe of Little Five Points. Built by Sembler on land formerly owned by Atlanta Gas Light in northwest Edgewood, it is made up of of retail, including the first intown Lowe's home improvement store.

Ronnie Bull (American football)

Ronald David Bull (born February 2, 1940) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL).
Early life.
Bull was born on February 2, 1940, in Kingsville, Texas. He started playing organized football as a halfback when he was in fifth grade. He played running back at Bishop High School in Bishop, Texas. In his senior year, Bull rushed for 2,451 yards in 12 games and led the nation in scoring with 225 points. He averaged 25 carries a game in high school. Bull earned All-District, All-State and All-America recognition. In his most prolific single game, he rushed for 395 yards and five touchdowns.
College football.
Bull was a two-way player at Baylor University (1958–61), in the Southwest Conference (SWC), starring on offense at halfback. Over three years, he rushed for 1,359 years, averaging 4.6 yards per carry, with 13 touchdowns. He also had 59 pass receptions for 636 yards and eight touchdowns. He even completed four passes, one going for a touchdown in 1959. Bull also played defense, started 36 of 37 games, and played 40 minutes in the game in which he did not start.
Bull was frequently in the top five offensive leaders annually in the SWC. In 1959, he was second in the Southwest Conference in receptions and total yards from scrimmage, third in rushing average and reception average, and fourth in rushing yards. In 1960, he was first in the SWC in plays from scrimmage and total touchdowns, second in rushing yards and total yards from scrimmage, third in receptions and reception average, and fourth in receiving yards. As a senior, he was third in receptions, receiving average and total touchdowns, and fourth in yards from scrimmage. He was named Southwest Conference Player of the Year in 1960, and was named an All-American in 1960 and 1961.
While at Baylor he played in the December 31,1960 Gator Bowl against the University of Florida, where he scored a touchdown with a minute left in the game, but Baylor lost 13–12 when it failed in making a two-point conversion. He played in the inaugural 1961 Gotham Bowl in New York, with Baylor winning over Utah State (and star player Merlin Olsen) 24–9. Bull received the Bill Corum Award as the game's most outstanding player.
Bull also played in the East–West Shrine Game, the Senior Bowl, and the College All-Star Game. After gaining 133 yards, including a then-record 58-yard run, Bull was named the 1962 Senior Bowl Most Valuable Player, along with Earl Gros.
Bull was a business administration major in college, and was selected as Baylor’s first CoSIDA (College Sports Information Directors of America) Academic All-American in 1961.
Professional football.
Bull was selected in the 1962 American Football League draft by the Dallas Texans with the team's first pick, third overall. Bull also was selected by the Chicago Bears as the seventh pick in the first round in the 1962 NFL draft. He ultimately signed to play for the Bears.
There was a controversy over whether Bull already had signed a contract to play for Bears before the Gotham Bowl, which would have made him ineligible for that game. The Bears personnel director attending the game, future Pro Football Hall of Fame coach George Allen, denied that Bull had already signed with the Bears. After the game, Allen took Bull and his wife to Chicago, as part of the team's effort to sign Bull, before Lamar Hunt, owner of the Dallas Texans, could sign Bull to play for the Texans in the American Football League. Bull did not sign in Chicago and he and his wife went home to Texas. Allen pursued Bull across the country to preempt Bull meeting with Lamar Hunt in Texas. Allen spent five hours talking to Bull at Love Field airport in Dallas, where Bull finally signed a contract with the Bears. Even without Allen's pursuit, Bull had reasoned that his best opportunity to play running back would come with the Bears.
Bull would go on to play nine years for the Bears, and one year with the Philadelphia Eagles before retiring. He started 10 games his rookie year, rushing for 363 yards in 113 attempts. He also had 31 receptions for 331 yards. The Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UPI), and "The Sporting News" selected Bull as NFL Rookie of the Year, with the Los Angeles' Rams Merlin Olsen second. Bull was on the 1963 Bears world championship team. He was second on the team in rushing attempts and total rushing yards.
When future Hall of Fame halfback Gale Sayers joined the Bears in 1965, he became the focus of the run offense, and Bull played more fullback than halfback. When Sayers was injured nine games into the 1968 season, Bull stepped up and had his best rushing season with 472 yards and a 4.4 yards per carry average, and most rushing attempts since 1963.
He played only six games in 1969, and started only 5 of 12 games in 1970. For his final season, after suffering a knee injury, Chicago traded Bull to the Eagles for a draft pick. He started nine games for Philadelphia and gained 426 yards from scrimmage. During his career, Bull played in 123 games, carried the ball 881 times for 3,222 yards and scored nine rushing touchdowns. He also caught 172 passes for 1,479 yards and five touchdowns.
In a 1963 interview with "Sports Illustrated", Bull described the routine nature of the game's brutality. In only his third professional game, he took a fist to the chin while coming out of the backfield for a pass on a "sky pattern", and barely made it to the sideline before passing out unconscious. Bull had been forewarned that a back running a sky pattern had to anticipate being "clotheslined" by a defender. Two days later, his teammates laughed as they repeatedly watched the film of Bull being clotheslined. He described instances when he would be repeatedly kicked at the bottom of a pileup, have his legs intentionally twisted, received thumb jabs to the eyes, be bitten, and have one player drop an elbow down on his back while being tackled by another. Bull did not let his anger get the best of him in response, or let these events get under his skin, because it was "'all part of the game'", "'a matter of dollars and cents'".
Honors.
Bull was inducted into Baylor's Athletics Hall of Fame in 1976. He was among the inaugural inductees in the Texas High School Hall of Fame in 1985. He was also inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame in 2001. Bull was on the cover of the October 14, 1963 issue of "Sports Illustrated".
Personal life.
He currently runs his specialty advertising business, Ronnie Bull Sales, Inc. in the Chicago area.

Samuel Weems

Samuel A. Weems (December 12, 1936 – January 25, 2003) was an American lawyer and convicted felon. His personal conduct and misconduct allegations made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. An Armenian genocide denialist, he wrote "Armenia: The Secrets of a "Christian" Terrorist State." He was disbarred by the Arkansas Bar Association for mixing clients' money with his own, convicted of arson and insurance fraud.
Biography.
Weems was disbarred while holding the office of prosecuting attorney for mixing his clients' money with his own. A year later he was convicted of arson and conspiring to defraud an insurance firm, but was not immediately removed from the office, despite the disbarment decision. He unsuccessfully ran for the position of mayor of Hazen, Arkansas, in 1994 and 1998. He made various controversial remarks such as "the Armenians have never been known as truth tellers" and "the number one export of Armenia is terrorism". Weems' book "Armenia: The Secrets of a "Christian" Terrorist State" was condemned by the Armenian Assembly of America as "outrageous and racist anti-Armenian propaganda". The book was subsequently published in Azerbaijani and Turkish.
In March 2002, Weems visited Turkey on the occasion of the 81st anniversary of the assassination of Talaat Pasha, one of the perpetrators of the Armenian genocide, and, in numerous interviews with news agencies as well as in the universities of Istanbul and Ankara, spoke on the "Armenian issue" and alleged a smear campaign against Turkey in Europe and the United States. He also made arrangements for the printing of his book in Turkish. He appears in "Sari Gelin", a documentary denying the Armenian genocide that was sponsored by the Ankara Chamber of Commerce. His second book about the , alleging an Armenian anti-Jewish conspiracy, was almost complete and ready for printing before he died. An obituary, published by Assembly of Turkish American Associations in their newspaper "The Turkish Times", stated that "Weems loved Turkey, was a great admirer of Atatürk and was devoted to Turkish causes, and despite many threats to his life, he worked relentlessly to let the people know the truth about the Armenian issue."
Weems died of a heart attack on January 25, 2003, and was survived by his wife, Gülnur, and son. He continues to be best known for his advocacy of, and contribution to, the denial of the Armenian genocide.

The Gospel Collection

The Gospel Collection is the 58th studio album by American country music singer George Jones, released on April 4, 2003 on the Bandit Records label, and the first single, "I Know A Man Who Can" was released through Rick Hendrix Company.
Background.
Jones's fondness for gospel music is well documented. The singer revealed to Jessica Walden of The 11th Hour magazine that his first musical memory was singing in church with his mother Clara and, in the 1989 documentary "Same Ole Me", he recalls that he learned how to play the guitar at the church where his mother, a devout woman, played piano. The church was run by Brother Burl Stephens (with whom Jones would credit as co-writer of several songs on his 1959 gospel album "Country Church Time") and Sister Annie, who George remembered "taught me my first chords on the guitar, like C, G, and D and things like that, and I started hangin' out over there more often. She'd get her guitar and we'd pick and sing together...We used to do all the really old gospel songs." Jones love of gospel music actually predated his exposure to country music, which he would not hear until his family acquired their first radio. Jones had also recorded a gospel album with his then-wife Tammy Wynette in 1972 called "We Love To Sing About Jesus" on Epic Records, which had been produced by Billy Sherrill. For nearly two decades, Jones and Sherrill would form one of the most successful artist/producer relationships in country music history, which included the recording of "He Stopped Loving Her Today", until Jones left Sony Music for MCA Nashville in 1991. Sherrill had actually been retired for years near the end of their run, producing only Jones. He came out of retirement to produce "The Gospel Collection". Jones decision to record the album is said to have been informed by his near-fatal crash in 1999, when he ran his SUV off the road while driving drunk. The crash was a significant turning point, as he explained to "Billboard" in 2006: "...when I had that wreck I made up my mind, it put the fear of God in me. No more smoking, no more drinking."
Reception.
Jones's 58th album peaked at number 19 on the "Billboard" country albums chart and number 3 on the "Billboard" Christian albums chart. It received positive reviews but it was also the first album that - after fifty years of singing, forty years of drinking, and literally thousands of shows - reveals cracks in the singer's legendary, mercurial voice. Thom Jurek of AllMusic notes: "There is no doubt he is still a great singer, but his ability to throw his voice around and hit the higher notes in his baritone register is all but gone. With his more limited stylistic vernacular, however, Jones digs deep and gets the tunes across, making them swing and sway with emotion and honky tonk swagger." John Morthland of Amazon.com compliments Sherrill's production, writing that "Circuit-preacher’s son Billy Sherrill, who guided Jones’s 1970s commercial ascension, came out of retirement to produce these 24 songs (on two discs) and, especially for a guy accused back then of gussying up country too much, he forges an austere sound."

Frontier Nursing Service

The Frontier Nursing Service (FNS) provides healthcare services to rural, underserved populations since 1925, and educates nurse-midwives since 1939.
The Service maintains six rural healthcare clinics in eastern Kentucky, the Mary Breckinridge Hospital (now part of Appalachian Regional Healthcare), the Mary Breckinridge Home Health Agency, the Frontier Nursing University and the Bed and Breakfast Inn at Wendover, Kentucky.
History.
Establishment of FNS and early years.
The organization was founded in 1925 in Leslie County, Kentucky by Mary Breckinridge (1881–1965) shortly after she had witnessed the operation of the Highlands and Islands Medical Service which had been founded in Scotland twelve years earlier. In choosing that site, she traveled through Leslie, Knott, and Owsley counties to determine what childbearing women and families needed most in those areas. On her travels, she spoke with midwives, recording data such as age, birthplace, literacy status, number of years in practice, cleanliness, and number of children reared for each midwife she spoke to. Breckinridge, who graduated from St. Luke's Hospital of Nursing in New York in 1910, chose that area of Kentucky as a site for the school for several reasons: it was a remote region that was difficult to access, suggesting that success there would equate to success anywhere; there were no licensed physicians in Leslie county; Breckinridge was from a well-known family in Kentucky, resulting in a built-in network for monetary support from other parts of the state. Breckinridge served as Director until her death in 1965.
Breckinridge intended that the Frontier Nursing Service would provide healthcare for children in remote rural areas, being moved to this work by the deaths of her own two children, Polly, who died four hours after her birth, and Breckie, who died four days after his fourth birthday. Additionally, death rates of infants and mothers were high in the United States during the 1920s: in 1923, the national maternal death rate stood at 6.7 per 1,000 live births; in 1920, the national infant mortality rate was 6 deaths for every 1,000 live births. During this time period, debates among physicians, health officials, and social reformers about the causes of high maternal and infant mortality were frequent and resulted in disagreements about who was best to oversee childbirth: general practitioners, obstetricians, or midwives. Frontier Nursing Service was the first group in the United States to employ nurses who were also qualified midwives. Since there were no midwifery schools in the US, FNS was able to secure qualified staff by offering scholarships to American nurses to study in Great Britain or by hiring qualified midwives from Great Britain. Originally, the organization was known as the Kentucky Committee for Mothers and Babies.
The Frontier Nursing Service grew rapidly during its first five years. With the help of two nurses, Edna Rockstroh and Freda Caffin, Breckinridge opened the group's first clinic in Hyden, Kentucky in 1925. The demand for the clinic grew rapidly, and within the first month of operation, Breckinridge and two nurse-midwives served 233 patients. By December of that year Breckinridge had raised a log house in Wendover, Kentucky, called the Big House, that became her home and the Frontier Nursing Service's headquarters. The Hyden Hospital and Health Center opened its doors in 1928 and was followed by nine outpost nursing centers in Leslie County and the Red Bird River section of Clay County, Kentucky. To center the outposts, Breckinridge did not use the county boundaries, instead, she located the outposts nine to twelve miles away from each other on the waterways and the natural routes of travel and trade. By that time, FNS covered 60 miles of territory.
Because of the remote location of the service and the communities it served, nurses had to travel by horseback. With this being said, Mary Breckinridge recruited couriers for the Frontier Nursing Service. The couriers were companions for the nurses. When they needed to go to a case the couriers were knowledgeable of the surrounding areas and trails and helped the nurses stay on track. Even on a ride late at the night, the nurses were never alone. In an article written by Anne Cockerham, she mentions that couriers were more than a GPS. A courier could be described as a right-hand man to the nurse. Whether it is taking them places, setting up their supplies, or just being there for support, couriers are very important for the Frontier Nursing Service. During these early years, nurses with equestrian experience had to be recruited from Great Britain, where Breckinridge had learned about modern midwifery, because there were no midwifery schools in the United States. She did send interested American women abroad tor education, paying for all of their expenses, provided they agreed to work for the Frontier Nursing Service for two years. The women who worked for the service traveled to remote locations, many without running water or electricity, providing care to people who were considered wild or even "foreign" to Americans in more populated areas.
Development of the Frontier Graduate School of Midwifery.
Upon the outbreak of World War II Breckinridge no longer could send American nurses to Britain where they had been going for midwifery training. To prevent this from slowing its operations, the Frontier Nursing Service quickly established the Frontier Graduate School of Midwifery. The first class matriculated in November 1939, and the school has operated ever since. The 6-month course was based on the curriculum of the Central Midwives Board of England and Scotland, and every student was required to participate in 20 midwifery cases. The first two classes were paid for by scholarships. Reva Rubin who was one of the first specialists in maternity nursing worked here.FNS trained students and for other agencies. By 1952, 122 graduates worked in the U.S. and foreign countries such as the Philippines, Japan, Alaska, India, Thailand, Africa, South Africa, and Latin America. By 1966, 285 qualified nurse-midwives worked in the U.S. and abroad, including The Philippines, New Guinea, Thailand, South Korea, Canada, France and some parts of Africa and South America. In 1970, the school's name was changed to the Frontier School of Midwifery and Family Nursing (FSMFN). Now named Frontier Nursing University, it offers distance education to train its students. The Frontier Nursing Service was the subject of the 1931 documentary film, "The Forgotten Frontier".
Addition of Family Nursing Education.
As the number of births decreased in Leslie County during the 1980s it became difficult to support a traditional midwifery program. During this time period, the Community-based Nurse-midwifery Education Program (CNEP) began as a pilot project funded by the PEW Foundation. The development of the CNEP was originally a cooperative effort of the Maternity Center Association (MCA), the National Association of Childbearing Centers (NACC), Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University (FPBSON/CWRU) and the Frontier Nursing Service (FNS). The goal was to enable nurses to remain in their communities while obtaining graduate education as nurse-midwives and ultimately increase the number of practicing nurse-midwives working in underserved areas. Through an affiliation with FPBSON/CWRU students completed a certificate education with FSMFN and attained a master's degree in nursing by completing nine credits on the FPBSON/CWRU campus in Cleveland, Ohio. The pilot project was very successful. In 1990, the FSMFN recognized that the CNEP model of education matched its own goals and mission. The President of the School and the Board of Directors voted to adopt the CNEP as its nurse-midwifery education program in 1991. Since then, FSMFN has graduated over 1000 nurse-midwives.
In the late 1960s, the Frontier Nursing Service recognized that as health care options became more complex, a broader based education was necessary for nurses to be able to provide comprehensive primary care to all family members. At this time the FSMFN developed the first certificate program to prepare family nurse practitioners. In 1970, the name of the school was changed to the Frontier School of Midwifery and Family Nursing (FSMFN) to reflect the addition of the FNP program. The last class to graduate from the combined family nurse-midwifery program was in August 1990. The Community-based Family Nurse Practitioner (CFNP) education program was reestablished in 1999 using the CNEP distance education model. With the acceptance of CFNP class 1 in 1999, the Frontier School of Midwifery and Family Nursing comes full circle in its mission to educate nurses to provide primary care that is comprehensive, safe, and culturally sensitive.
The Frontier Nursing Service Complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The listing included four contributing buildings and nine contributing structures.
Frontier Nursing University.
In 2000, recognizing that students desired to complete their entire education at FSMFN using distance education methods, the board of directors approved a plan for FSMFN to pursue full accreditation as an independent graduate school which would grant a Master of Science in nursing. There was much work to be done including a complete curriculum revision and the preparation of the faculty at the doctoral level. On December 6, 2004, the school was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to grant a Master of Science in Nursing Degree. The American College of Nurse-Midwives granted institutional accreditation as well as programmatic accreditation for the nurse-midwifery program in February 2005. National League for Nursing accreditation followed in March 2005. In 2011, the school changed its name to Frontier Nursing University to emphasize its capacity to offer graduate degrees in nursing.
Today the university offers several programs geared towards nurses who desire to pursue preparation as a nurse-midwife or nurse practitioner. These include a Master of Science in Nursing degree with tracks as a nurse-midwife, family nurse practitioner and women's health nurse practitioner. FSMFN also offers post-masters certificates in these specialties. In July 2016, the university added an online program for nurse-midwives and nurse practitioners for post-graduate certification in psychiatric-mental health nursing. FSMFN now has graduates representing every state in the United States and seven foreign countries.
In 2024 Frontier Nursing Service partnered with Ob Hospitalist Group to make the nursing program stronger. For the FNS clinical rotations, many of the students had to travel far and were not close to home. With this new connection the OBHG provides more clinical locations around the United States so that all students can work hard, while not having to travel an insane amount of miles to learn. There are already 22 programs placed around the country and they are still expanding to this day.
Impact.
The maternal mortality rate for Frontier Nursing Services was 9.1 per 10,000 births, compared with 34 per 10,000 births for the United States as a whole.
Only 3.8 percent of babies tended by the Frontier Nursing Service had low birth weight, compared with 7.6 percent for the country overall.
Relocation of Frontier Nursing University.
In 2018, the Frontier Nursing University (FNU) fully moved out of Leslie County and to Versailles, Kentucky, despite its founder's mission to serve the mountain people of rural Kentucky. Their institutional mission statement reads, "Our mission is to provide accessible nurse-midwifery and nurse practitioner education that integrates the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We transform healthcare by preparing innovative, ethical, compassionate, and entrepreneurial leaders to work with all people with an emphasis on rural and underserved communities."
In a statement about the move, FNU claimed "the new 67-acre campus in that FNU purchased in Versailles will continue to keep the University in a rural county but is also less than ten minutes from the Lexington Bluegrass Airport and accessible from major highways." Woodford County, Kentucky, the county where Versailles resides, is classified as a metro area according to the USDA Economic Research Service, not rural.
In addition to moving all FNU operations to metro Versailles, Kentucky, FNU attempted to remove a stained glass window belonging to the St. Christopher's Chapel in Hyden, Kentucky to be installed at their new campus in Central Kentucky leading to Congressman Hal Rogers to make this statement, "Quite frankly, the action taken by this board to quietly remove the stained-glass window, as well as the educational operations from Leslie County, does not align with Mary Breckinridge’s legendary heart of service and courageous action for the Appalachian people." A petition on change.org called for the return of the stained glass window to the chapel and had garnered over 3,700 signatures. Return of the stained glass window to the original chapel in Hyden, Kentucky has not been confirmed.
Kentucky Law.
In 2019, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky passed Senate Bill 84 to provide certification and regulation for midwives, as well as creating a new public council to implement new licensure requirements. Kentucky stopped certifying midwives in 1975, and there have been no clear regulations on the practice for more than thirty years. The advisory council is set up under the Board of Nursing, which will promulgate regulations to establish standards for training programs, licensing, transfer of care from a midwife to a hospital, disciplinary actions, and more, as well as define a list of conditions that require the collaboration, consultation or referral of a client to a physician or other appropriate healthcare provider.
The law also criminalizes unlicensed midwife services, although it does provide exceptions for traditional birth attendants for religious or cultural purposes and for family members and friends providing uncompensated care. It is unclear how these statutory terms will be interpreted and enforced.

Olof Guterstam

Olof Viktor Detlof Guterstam (born 4 January 1983) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a striker. He spent most of his career at IF Brommapojkarna, but also represented FC Brussels, Hammarby IF, IK Frej, and Älvsjö AIK FF during a career that spanned between 2002 and 2012. He won two caps for the Sweden men's national football team in 2007.
Club career.
Early career.
Guterstam arrived at Brommapojkarna in 2002, having previously played for Enskede IK and Älvsjö AIK as a midfielder and as a winger. At Brommapojkarna he was retrained to be a striker, at the initiative of the then manager of the team, Benny Persson.
Brommapojkarna.
Guterstam was the joint top scorer of the 2006 Superettan season with 17 goals, alongside Falkenbergs FF's Stefan Rodevåg. He was also instrumental in taking Brommapojkarna to Allsvenskan, the highest division in Swedish football, scoring two goals in the qualifiers against BK Häcken in November 2006.
He played 25 games with Brommapojkarna in Allsvenskan and scored 4 goals. Brommapojkarna finished last in Allsvenskan and the club was relegated to Superettan.
Loan to FC Brussels.
Instead of following the club to Superettan, Guterstam signed a half-year loan contract with a Belgian club, FC Brussels. Guterstam scored 4 goals in 14 games for the Belgian club.
Loan to Hammarby IF.
In May 2008, Guterstam returned to Brommapojkarna. Shortly after his return he signed a half-year loan contract, with an option of a permanent transfer, with Swedish club Hammarby IF. After a poor start with the club, he improved and eventually managed to score two goals. Despite his improvement, Hammarby did not choose to buy him after the contract expired.
Later career and retirement.
On 25 December 2010, Guterstam left IF Brommapojkarna after 8 years at the club and signed a two-year contract with IK Frej, who had just been promoted to Division 1 Norra. He finished up his competitive footballing career by playing a season for his boyhood club Älvsjö AIK in Division 3.
In 2014, Guterstam was inducted into Brommapojkarna's Hall of Fame.
International career.
Guterstam was called up to the Sweden national team for the first time for their South American tour in January 2007. He made his international debut in a 2–1 loss against Ecuador. He won his second and last international cap four days later, when Sweden lost 2–0 to Venezuela.
Personal life.
In the beginning of his professional football career, Guterstam also attended medical school at Karolinska Institutet in order to become a physician. Following his retirement from professional football, he took up his medical studies again after a 4-year hiatus. Guterstam currently serves as a physician.

Dark therapy

Dark therapy is the practice of keeping people in complete darkness for extended periods of time in an attempt to treat psychological conditions. The human body produces the melatonin hormone, which is responsible for supporting the circadian rhythms. Darkness seems to help keep these circadian rhythms stable. A related form of dark therapy is to block blue wavelength lights to stop the disintegration of melatonin.
The practice has a precursor in retreats of Tibetan monks who would descend alone into caves for 49 days, a ceremony known as "yang-ti". Dark therapy was popularised in the West in the 1960s, by German anthropologist Holger Kalweit who called it "Dunkeltherapie" ().
This dark therapy concept was explored in 1998 in research which suggested that systematic exposure to darkness might alter people's mood. Original studies enforced 14 hours of darkness to bipolar patients for three nights straight. This study showed a decrease of manic episodes in the patients. Participation in this study became unrealistic, as patients did not want to participate in treatment of total darkness from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. More recently, with the discovery of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, it has been hypothesized that similar results could be achieved by blocking blue light, as a potential treatment for bipolar disorder. Moreover, researchers exploring blue-blocking glasses have so far considered dark therapy only as an add-on treatment to be used together with psychotherapy, rather than a replacement for other therapies.
Another study consisting of healthy females and males suggested that a single exposure to blue light after being kept in a dim setting could reduce sleepiness. Contrary to the original claim that decreasing the amount of blue light could help with insomnia, this study suggested improvement with blue light exposure.

Out of the Aeons

"Out of the Aeons" is a short story by American writers H. P. Lovecraft and Hazel Heald, a writer from Somerville, Massachusetts. First published in the April 1935 issue of "Weird Tales" magazine, it was one of five stories Lovecraft revised for Heald. It focuses on a Boston museum that displays an ancient mummy recovered from a sunken island. The story is told from the point of view of the curator of the Cabot Museum in Boston.
Plot.
In 1879, a freighter captain discovered an uncharted island, presumably risen from its sunken state due to volcanic activity. From it, he recovered a strange mummy and a metal cylinder containing a scroll. A year later, the mummy is put on display in the museum, and the island mysteriously vanishes without a trace.
Over the years, the mummy gains a reputation as a possible link to an ancient tale from the "Black Book" by Friedrich von Juntz of a man named T'yog, who challenged Ghatanothoa, one of the gods of Yuggoth, using the power of a magical scroll, the work of the Great Old Ones opposed to Ghatanothoa. In his sleep, however, one of the cultists stole the true magical scroll and replaced it with a fake one, and T'yog was never seen again. When the possible link to the "Black Book" and T'yog reaches the general public, the narrator begins to notice more and more suspect foreigners coming to the museum.
Soon, several attempts are made to steal the mummy. During one attempt, two men, armed with the true scroll, die as the mummy seemingly springs to life, opening its eyes and revealing an image of the approaching form of Ghatanothoa. The image had the power of Ghatanothoa to mummify any who view it, turning one of the thieves into a mummy, but the image had faded by the time the curator examines it, and it only frightens the curator. Though he never understands what he has seen, the curator is horribly shaken. He orders an autopsy of the mummy's braincase. The curator and all present are shocked that the mummy's brain is still alive. The mummy is the living remains of T'yog, and is fully aware of its surroundings.
Adaptations.
Robert Bloch wrote a screen adaptation of the story for the 1971 TV series "Night Gallery", however it was not produced. It was rewritten by Alvin T. Sapinsley, filmed, and broadcast as "Last Rites of a Dead Druid". Sapinsley's screenplay bore no relation to the original Lovecraft tale that Bloch had adapted.

The Magic Swan Geese

The Magic Swan Geese () is a Russian fairy tale collected by Alexander Afanasyev in "Narodnye russkie skazki", numbered 113.
It is classified in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as tale type ATU 480A*.
Synopsis.
Once there was a couple who had both a daughter and a son. They left their daughter in charge of her younger brother, but one day she lost track of him and the magic swan geese snatched him away. The daughter chased after him and came upon an oven that offered to tell her if she ate its rye buns; she scorned them, saying she didn't even eat wheat buns. She also scorned similar offers from an apple tree, and a river of milk. She came across a little hut built on a hen's foot, in which she found Baba Yaga with her brother; Baba Yaga sent her to spin flax and left. A mouse scurried out and said it would tell her what she needed to know if she gave it porridge; she did, and it told her that Baba Yaga was heating the bath house to steam her, then she would cook her. The mouse took over her spinning, and the girl took her brother and fled.
Baba Yaga sent the swan geese after her. She begged the river for aid, and it insisted she drink some of it first; she did, and it sheltered her. When she ran on, the swan geese followed again, and the same happened with the apple tree and the oven. Then she reached home safely.
Translations.
A more literal translation of the tale's title is "The Swan-Geese". Bernard Isaacs translated the tale as "Little Girl and Swan-Geese", while Bonnie Marshall Carey translated it as "Baba Yaga's Geese".
Analysis.
Tale type.
The tale is classified in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as type ATU 480A*, "Three Sisters Set Out to Save Their Little Brother".
German scholar Hans-Jörg Uther, in his 2004 revision of the ATU index, reported variants from Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and among the Mari/Cheremis and Wotian/Syrjanien peoples. Jack Haney stated that type 480A* seemed to appear "very rarely" outside the area of the East Slavic languages.
Variants.
East Slavic.
The story is classified in the East Slavic Folktale Classification (), last updated by scholar in 1979, as type SUS 480A*, "". According to the catalogue, the type is reported in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.
Russia.
The oldest attestation of the tale type in Russia seems to be a late-18th century publication, with the tale "Сказка о Сизом Орле и мальчике" ("The Fairy Tale about the Blue Eagle and the Boy").
Lithuania.
Lithuanian folklorist Jonas Balys (), in his analysis of Lithuanian folktales (published in 1936), previously classified the Lithuanian variants as *314C (a type not indexed at the international classification, at the time), "Trys seserys gelbsti raganos pavogtą broliuką".
According to Stith Thompson's reworked folktale classification (published in 1961), tale type AaTh 480A* registered 30 variants in Lithuania.
Latvian.
A similar story is found in Latvia, also classified as type AaTh 480A*, "Bārenīte pie raganas" ("The Orphan in the Witch's House"): the heroine's little brother is taken by the witch to her lair. The heroine's sisters try to get him back, and fail. The heroine herself is kind to objects on her way to the witch, rescues her little brother and the objects protect her when the witch goes after her.
Estonia.
The tale type ATU 480A* is also reported in Estonia, with the title "Kured viivad venna ära" ("The Cranes Take the Brother Away"). In the Estonian variants, the heroine's little brother is taken away by cranes or geese.
Mari people.
Scholar S. S. Sabitov located a similar narrative in the "Catalogue of Tales of Magic from the Mari people", indexed as type 480A*, "Сестра отправляется спасать своего брата" ("Sister races to save her brother)": the heroine treats objects and trees with respect, which protect her when she escapes with her brother from the witch Vuver-kuva and her geese.
Adaptations.
1949, "Soyuzmultfilm": a 20-minute animated film "Гуси-лебеди" by the directors Ivan Ivanov-Vano and Aleksandra Snezhko-Blotskaya. It was repeatedly published on VHS and DVD in collections of the Soviet animated films.

Engineering technician

An engineering technician is a professional trained in skills and techniques related to a specific branch of technology, with a practical understanding of the relevant engineering concepts. Engineering technicians often assist in projects relating to research and development, or focus on post-development activities like implementation or operation.
The Dublin Accord was signed in 2002 as an international agreement recognizing engineering technician qualifications. The Dublin Accord is analogous to the Washington Accord for engineers and the Sydney Accord for engineering technologists.
Nature of work.
Engineering technicians help solve technical problems in many ways. They build or set up equipment, conduct experiments, collect data, and calculate results. They might also help to make a model of new equipment. Some technicians work in quality control, checking products, tests, and collecting data. In manufacturing, they help to design and develop products. They also find ways to produce things efficiently. There are multiple fields in this job such as; software design, repair, etc.
They may also be people who produce technical drawings or engineering drawings.
Engineering technicians are responsible for using the theories and principles of science, engineering, and mathematics to solve problems and come up with solutions in the research, design, development, manufacturing, sales, construction, inspection, and maintenance of systems and products. Engineering technicians help engineers and scientists in researching and developing, while some other engineering technicians may be responsible for inspections, quality control, and processes which may include conducting tests and data collection.
Education.
Engineering technician diplomas and two-year degrees are generally offered by technical schools and non-university higher education institutions like colleges of further education, vocational schools, and community colleges. Many four-year colleges and universities offer bachelor's degrees in engineering technology but engineering technologists are somewhat different from engineering technicians.
In Portugal and Spain, the titles and (literally 'technical engineering') are used. Professionals attain the title with the award of a short-cycle three- to four-year undergraduate degree (associate degree or bachelor's degree) in a technical engineering field from colleges or technical engineering institutes (in Portugal) and (in Spain), from universities. Spanish "technical engineers" have full competency in their respective professional fields of engineering, being the difference that the three or four-year Engineers have competence only in their specialty (Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, etc.), and the "Engineering Superior School" Engineers have wider competencies.
In the United States, the engineering technology accreditation commission (ETAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) grants two-year associate degree programs to students that meet a set of specified standards. These programs include at least a college algebra and trigonometry course and, if needed, one or two basic science courses at any accredited school. The number of math and science prerequisite courses depends on the branch of engineering that the student chooses.
Engineering technicians apply scientific and engineering skills usually gained in postsecondary programs below the bachelor's degree level or through short-cycle bachelor's degrees. However, some university institutions award undergraduate degrees in the engineering field, which may confer the title of Engineering technician to the student, who is eligible to become a fully chartered engineer after further studies at the master's degree level. Engineering technicians are called professional engineers in the UK only.
Certification.
Even though the term engineering technician is used throughout, it is mindful that these roles are often termed differently within specific jurisdictions. It also includes roles such as; certified or professional technician, which may also be called engineering associates.
Canada.
The individual professional title "Certified Technician" and post-nominal "C.Tech." are protected by provincial legislation and can only be used by registrants certified by engineering and applied science member organizations. The nine provincial professional associations are unified federally through Technology Professionals Canada, which advocates for the profession within the provincial associations and respective regulatory bodies.
United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom, the term "Engineering Technician" and post-nominal "EngTech" are protected in civil law and can only be used by technicians registered with the Engineering Council UK.

<doc id="6997478" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6997478" title="Cys-loop receptor">
Cys-loop receptor

The Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel superfamily is composed of nicotinic acetylcholine, GABAA, GABAA-ρ, glycine, 5-HT3, and zinc-activated (ZAC) receptors. These receptors are composed of five protein subunits which form a pentameric arrangement around a central pore. There are usually 2 alpha subunits and 3 other beta, gamma, or delta subunits (some consist of 5 alpha subunits). 
The name of the family refers to a characteristic loop formed by 13 highly conserved amino acids between two cysteine (Cys) residues, which form a disulfide bond near the N-terminal extracellular domain.
Cys-loop receptors are known only in eukaryotes, but are part of a larger family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Only the Cys-loop clade includes the pair of bridging cysteine residues. The larger superfamily includes bacterial (e.g. GLIC) as well as non-Cys-loop eukaryotic receptors, and is referred to as "pentameric ligand-gated ion channels", or "Pro-loop receptors".
All subunits consist of a large conserved extracellular N-terminal domain, three highly conserved transmembrane domains, a cytoplasmic loop of variable size and amino acid sequence, and a fourth transmembrane region with a relatively short and variable extracellular C-terminal domain.
Neurotransmitters bind at the interface between subunits in the extracellular domain.
Each subunit contains four membrane-spanning alpha helices (M1, M2, M3, M4). The pore is formed primarily by the M2 helices. The M3-M4 linker is the intracellular domain that binds the cytoskeleton.
Binding.
Most knowledge about cys-loop receptors comes from inferences made while studying various members of the family. Research on the structures of acetylcholine binding proteins (AChBP) determined that the binding sites consist of six loops, with the first three forming the principal face and the next three forming the complementary face. The last loop on the principal face wraps over the ligand in the active receptor. This site is also abundant in aromatic residues.
Recent literature indicates that the Trp residue on loop B is crucial for both agonist and antagonist binding. The neurotransmitter is taken into the binding site where it interacts (through hydrogen and cation-π bonding) with the amino acid resides in the aromatic box, located on the principal face of the binding site. Another essential interaction occurs between the agonist and a tyrosine on loop C. Upon interaction, the loop undergoes a conformational change and rotates down to cap the molecule in the binding site.
Channel gating.
Through research done on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors it has been determined that the channels are activated through allosteric interactions between the binding and gating domains. Once the agonist binds it brings about conformational changes (including moving a beta sheet of the amino-terminal domain, and outward movement from loops 2, F and cys-loop which are tied to the M2-M3 linker and pull the channel open). Electron microscopy (at 9 Å) shows that the opening is caused by rotation at the M2 domain, but other studies on crystal structures of these receptors has shown that the opening could be a result from a M2 tilt which leads to pore dilation and a quaternary turn of the entire pentameric receptor.

Lynn Davis (photographer)

Lynn Davis is an American photographer known for her large-scale black-and-white photographs which are widely collected publicly and privately and are internationally exhibited.
Biography.
Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1944, Davis studied at University of Colorado between 1962 and 1964, and at the University of Minnesota from 1964 to 1966. She received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1970, and in 1974 she began her career as an apprentice to Berenice Abbott.
Davis' first exhibition hung at the International Center of Photography in New York City in 1979, alongside her close friend Robert Mapplethorpe. After her first trip to Greenland, in 1986, she gave up photographing the human form, shifting her lens toward the monumental landscapes and cultural/architectural icons for which she is renowned.
Davis lives in Hudson, New York with her husband, writer Rudy Wurlitzer. Her prints appear in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, among others. In 1999, the J. Paul Getty Museum held an exhibition of Davis' prints, and a solo show, "Africa", was held at the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson, Arizona in 1999.

Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism

Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP or sometimes T-RFLP) is a molecular biology technique for profiling of microbial communities based on the position of a restriction site closest to a labelled end of an amplified gene. The method is based on digesting a mixture of PCR amplified variants of a single gene using one or more restriction enzymes and detecting the size of each of the individual resulting terminal fragments using a DNA sequencer. The result is a graph image where the x-axis represents the sizes of the fragment and the y-axis represents their fluorescence intensity.
Background.
TRFLP is one of several molecular methods aimed to generate a fingerprint of an unknown microbial community. Other similar methods include DGGE, TGGE, ARISA, ARDRA, PLFA, etc.
&lt;br&gt;These relatively high throughput methods were developed in order to reduce the cost and effort in analyzing microbial communities using a clone library. The method was first described by Avaniss-Aghajani et al in 1994 and later by Liu in 1997 which employed the amplification of the 16S rDNA target gene from the DNA of several isolated bacteria as well as environmental samples.
&lt;br&gt;Since then the method has been applied for the use of other marker genes such as the functional marker gene pmoA to analyze methanotrophic communities.
Method.
Like most other community analysis methods, TRFLP is also based on PCR amplification of a target gene. In the case of TRFLP, the amplification is performed with one or both the primers having their 5’ end labeled with a fluorescent molecule. In case both primers are labeled, different fluorescent dyes are required. While several common fluorescent dyes can be used for the purpose of tagging such as 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM), ROX, carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA, a rhodamine-based dye), and hexachlorofluorescein (HEX), the most widely used dye is 6-FAM. The mixture of amplicons is then subjected to a restriction reaction, normally using a four-cutter restriction enzyme. Following the restriction reaction, the mixture of fragments is separated using either capillary or polyacrylamide electrophoresis in a DNA sequencer and the sizes of the different terminal fragments are determined by the fluorescence detector. Because the excised mixture of amplicons is analyzed in a sequencer, only the terminal fragments (i.e. the labeled end or ends of the amplicon) are read while all other fragments are ignored. Thus, T-RFLP is different from ARDRA and RFLP in which all restriction fragments are visualized. In addition to these steps the TRFLP protocol often includes a cleanup of the PCR products prior to the restriction and in case a capillary electrophoresis is used a desalting stage is also performed prior to running the sample.
Data format and artifacts.
The result of a T-RFLP profiling is a graph called electropherogram which is an intensity plot representation of an electrophoresis experiment (gel or capillary). In an electropherogram the X-axis marks the sizes of the fragments while the Y-axis marks the fluorescence intensity of each fragment. Thus, what appears on an electrophoresis gel as a band appears as a peak on the electropherogram whose integral is its total fluorescence. In a T–RFLP profile each peak assumingly corresponds to one genetic variant in the original sample while its height or area corresponds to its relative abundance in the specific community. Both assumptions listed above, however, are not always met. Often, several different bacteria in a population might give a single peak on the electropherogram due to the presence of a restriction site for the particular restriction enzyme used in the experiment at the same position. To overcome this problem and to increase the resolving power of this technique a single sample can be digested in parallel by several enzymes (often three) resulting in three T-RFLP profiles per sample each resolving some variants while missing others. Another modification which is sometimes used is to fluorescently label the reverse primer as well using a different dye, again resulting in two parallel profiles per sample each resolving a different number of variants.
In addition to convergence of two distinct genetic variants into a single peak artifacts might also appear, mainly in the form of false peaks. False peaks are generally of two types: background “noises” and “pseudo” TRFs. Background (noise) peaks are peaks resulting from the sensitivity of the detector in use. These peaks are often small in their intensity and usually form a problem in case the total intensity of the profile is low (i.e. low concentration of DNA). Because these peaks result from background noise they are normally irreproducible in replicate profiles, thus the problem can be tackled by producing a consensus profile from several replicates or by eliminating peaks below a certain threshold. Several other computational techniques were also introduced in order to deal with this problem. Pseudo TRFs, on the other hand, are reproducible peaks and are linear to the amount of DNA loaded. These peaks are thought to be the result of ssDNA annealing on to itself and creating double stranded random restriction sites which are later recognized by the restriction enzyme resulting in a terminal fragment which does not represent any genuine genetic variant. It has been suggested that applying a DNA exonuclease such as the Mung bean exonuclease prior to the digestion stage might eliminate such artifact.
Interpretation of data.
The data resulting from the electropherogram is normally interpreted in one of the following ways.
Pattern comparison.
In pattern comparison the general shapes of electropherograms of different samples are compared for changes such as presence-absence of peaks between treatments, their relative size, etc.
Complementing with a clone library.
If a clone library is constructed in parallel to the T-RFLP analysis then the clones can be used to assess and interpret the T-RFLP profile. In this method the TRF of each clone is determined either directly (i.e. performing T-RFLP analysis on each single clone) or by "in silico" analysis of that clone’s sequence. By comparing the T-RFLP profile to a clone library it is possible to validate each of the peaks as genuine as well as to assess the relative abundance of each variant in the library.
Peak resolving using a database.
Several computer applications attempt to relate the peaks in an electropherogram to specific bacteria in a database. Normally this type of analysis is done by simultaneously resolving several profiles of a single sample obtained with different restriction enzymes. The software then resolves the profile by attempting to maximize the matches between the peaks in the profiles and the entries in the database so that the number of peaks left without a matching sequence is minimal. The software withdraws from the database only those sequences which have their TRFs in all analyzed profiles.
Multivariate analysis.
A recently growing way to analyze T-RFLP profiles is use multivariate statistical methods to interpret the T-RFLP data. Usually the methods applied are those commonly used in ecology and especially in the study of biodiversity. Among them ordinations and cluster analysis are the most widely used.
In order to perform multivariate statistical analysis on T-RFLP data, the data must first be converted to table known as a “sample by species table“ which depicts the different samples (T-RFLP profiles) versus the species (T-RFS) with the height or area of the peaks as values.
Advantages and disadvantages.
As T-RFLP is a fingerprinting technique its advantages and drawbacks are often discussed in comparison with other similar techniques, mostly DGGE.
Advantages.
The major advantage of T-RFLP is the use of an automated sequencer which gives highly reproducible results for repeated samples. Although the genetic profiles are not completely reproducible and several minor peaks which appear are irreproducible the overall shape of the electropherogram and the ratios of the major peaks are considered reproducible. The use of an automated sequencer which outputs the results in a digital numerical format also enables an easy way to store the data and compare different samples and experiments. The numerical format of the data can and has been used for relative (though not absolute) quantification and statistical analysis. Although sequence data cannot be definitively inferred directly from the T-RFLP profile, ‘’in-silico’’ assignment of the peaks to existing sequences is possible to a certain extent.
Drawbacks.
Because T-RFLP relies on DNA extraction methods and PCR, the biases inherent to both will affect the results of the analysis. Also, the fact that only the terminal fragments are being read means that any two distinct sequences which share a terminal restriction site will result in one peak only on the electropherogram and will be indistinguishable. Indeed, when T-RFLP is applied on a complex microbial community the result is often a compression of the total diversity to normally 20-50 distinct peaks only representing each an unknown number of distinct sequences. Although this phenomenon makes the T-RFLP results easier to handle, it naturally introduces biases and oversimplification of the real diversity. Attempts to minimize (but not overcome) this problem are often done by applying several restriction enzymes and/ or labeling both primers with a different fluorescent dye. The inability to retrieve sequences from T-RFLP often leads to the need to construct and analyze one or more clone libraries in parallel to the T-RFLP analysis which adds to the effort and complicates analysis. The possible appearance of false (pseudo) T-RFs, as discussed above, is yet another drawback. To handle this researchers often only consider peaks which can be affiliated to sequences in a clone library.

Live with the Possum

Live with the Possum is a live album by American country music singer George Jones released on November 9, 1999, on the Asylum Records label. It was Jones's second and final album with Asylum Records and his second ever live album. Recorded in Knoxville on May 21, 1993, at the Knoxville Civic Center in Knoxville, Tennessee, it was the soundtrack of a previously released video of Jones in concert called "Live in Tennessee". Alan Jackson introduced the set with a short tribute. Ron Gaddis, Jones' bass player and band leader, provided vocals on "No Show Jones," the concert opener that George originally recorded with Merle Haggard in 1982. In 2006 Jones commented to Billboard, "As long as the people still want to come, I'm gonna be there. I don't care if I'm 95. I'm at the point in life where I really could shut it off, but what would I do?"

Matir Moina

Matir Moina (; also known in English as The Clay Bird) is a 2002 Bengali war-drama film written and directed by Tareque Masud. It was his debut feature film. Based on Tareque's story the screenplay was co-written by Tareque and Catherine Masud. In the film, Tareque's childhood experience is revealed against the backdrop of 1969 Mass uprising in East Pakistan on the eve of Bangladesh Liberation War. The film stars Nurul Islam Bablu, Russell Farazi, Jayanta Chattopadhyay, Rokeya Prachy, Soaeb Islam and Lameesa R. Reemjheem in the lead role. It is considered one of the best Bangladeshi films of 21st century.
The film deals with its historical references during the independence of Bangladesh. It portrays the experiences of a young protagonist, his family, his teachers and his life at the madrasah. Production began with initial funding from the French government. The film was officially screened on 15 May 2002 at the 55th Cannes Film Festival. Produced by Catherine Masud, the film grossed about at the box office after its release.
The film was initially banned in Bangladesh. After the expulsion order was revoked, VCD and DVD version of the film were released on 17 April 2005 by Laser Vision. In 2002, as the first Bangladeshi film, it won the FIPRESCI Prize in section Directors' Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2004, the film won the National Film Awards for Best Child Artist and Best Screenplay. The film also won various domestic and international awards, including awards in five categories at the 24th Bachsas Awards. It was Bangladesh's first submission for Best Foreign Language Film category at the 75th Academy Awards in 2002.
Plot.
The film is set in the late 1960s, during the unrest period in East Pakistan leading up to the Bangladesh War of Liberation. The story is of a small village family which comes to grip with their culture, faith, tradition, and the brutal political changes. The autobiographical film, set against the backdrop of the director's childhood, is based on the life story which is pictured by a teenage character named Anu (Nurul Islam Bablu). He lives with his fundamentalist-Muslim father, Kazi (Jayanta Chattopadhyay), who practices homoeopathic medicines. His mother, Ayesha (Rokeya Prachy) was once a spirited girl, but after her marriage, she becomes sullen in subservience to her fundamentalist husband. Anu has a little sister named Asma. Kazi's younger brother Milon is involved in local politics protesting against Pakistan's military rule and follows Left-wing politics. Despite Kazi's dislike, Milon took Anu to see Hindu festivals and the Canoe sprint. The film depicts the culture of secular Bengal, including folk-songs, Puthi recitation, Chaitra Sankranti or Charak Puja, embroidery, rural fairs, Bahas etc.
Finally, Kazi sent Anu to a madrasa (Islamic school) because of his religious beliefs. At the madrasa, Anu met and befriended Rokon (Russell Farazi), an outcast student, who invites him to play catch with an imaginary ball. Rokon's role is different from other students. After all, Anu tried to adjust to life away from home. Suddenly his younger sister Asma falls ill and dies because of Kazi's refusal to use modern medicines. On the other hand, at the madrasa Rokon is an eccentric misfit and forced by the headmaster to undergo an exorcism by ducking in the freezing pond to cure himself of Jinn.
As the political upheaval reaches a critical stage, internal crises begin to occur in Anu's family. As political divisions intensified, moderate and extremist ideologies developed in Anu's madrasa and growing divisions arose. The same picture of division is seen in Anu's family and her independent mother Ayesha. Kazi still believes in the religious unity of Pakistan, in the face of cruel, contradictory events. A shattering political development then changes their town, their life, and the inner dynamics of the family, including the patriarch's role. The film, which focuses on religious liberalism, cultural diversity, and the incomprehensibility of Islam, has universal relevance in a troubled world.
Pre-production.
For many years, Tareque and Catherine Masud were planning to make a feature based on Tareque's childhood experience at the madrasa (Islamic school) during the late 1960s in the East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). That was a turbulent period in the history of Bangladesh. Before liberation its eastern wing Islamic State of Pakistan was divided into a strong secular and democratic movement and a pro-Islamic military junta bent on stifling dissent and reform which leads to 1969 Mass uprising in East Pakistan. The film contents reference to historical events. In this film, Masud wanted to tell his autobiographical story through the childish vision. In May 2000, based on the quality of the screenplay they received a grant from the French Ministry of Culture and Communication and the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs Fonds Sud (South Fund) for the production of films. This grant also covered the film stock, 35 mm camera equipment and necessary laboratory facilities. Later, Paris-based production and distribution company Mk2, was contracted to co-produce and distribute the film internationally. Multiple producers co-produced the film with Catherine.
Production.
At the end of 2000, a year and a half of film production began in Bhanga, Faridpur. Masood and Catherine invested almost their entire savings in projects involving ambitious massive seasonal shooting and timing publication design. The characters made up entirely of non-professional actors, including street children, Madrasa students-teachers, rural folk musicians and villagers. As the first Bangladeshi feature, "Matir Moina" using the live sound recording to capture spontaneous performances and live ambience. The film was also shot on actual locations in rural settings and small towns in Dhamrai and Faridpur, during all winter, monsoon and spring seasons. It was completed in early 2002.
Release.
Screening.
As the first Bangladeshi feature film, it was initially screened on 15 May 2002 at the 55th Cannes Film Festival in Directors' Fortnight section. In addition to its commercial release in Europe and Americas, the film was screened at multiple festivals in later years. In August 2002, the film was screened at the Edinburgh International Film Festival and the Montreal World Film Festival in Canada. In the same year on
9 October it was screened at the Sitges Film Festival in Spain, and the Cairo International Film Festival in Egypt.
On 11 January 2003, the film was screened at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in the United States. In the same year on 9 February, it was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. On 5 April 2003, the film was selected at the New Directors/New Film Festival, jointly organized by the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York City and the Museum of Modern Art. It was screened on 17 December at the 8th International Film Festival of Kerala in India. On 15 February 2004, the film was screened at the Dublin International Film Festival in Ireland. A press screening was held on 24 March. In 2015, "Matir Moina" was screened at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy as the inaugural film at the Bangladesh Film Festival.
Commercial release.
Outside its home country, the film was initially released in theatres in France. Due to its ban, the film was not initially screened commercially in Bangladesh. However, the film was later released commercially in only two theatres in Dhaka. The film was released on 30 April 2004 in New York and San Francisco coastal theatres. In October 2002, the film was released in Dhaka. Later year, on 4 July 2003, it was released commercially in the United Kingdom as the first Bangladeshi film. In the same year on 14 August, it was recorded due to a 4-week long exhibition in Dhaka. The film was re-released commercially on 29 July 2006 in Kolkata, India.
Controversy and censorship.
After the initial screening at Cannes, the film got international press coverage for its positive portrayal of Bangladesh as well as its tolerant traditions. Due to its religious content the film was banned from public screening in the country by the Bangladesh Film Censor Board. The ban also claimed that it provided a distorted image of the madrasa system in the sub-continent. After a massive campaign against the ban was launched in the Bangladeshi media and on the Internet, there was pressure on the Bangladeshi Government to revoke the ban. Tareq and Catherine Masud brought a case against the ban in the Bangladesh Supreme Court, Appellate Division, which ruled in their favour. As a result, the film was allowed to be released in Bangladesh in late 2002.
Television broadcasting.
Channel Four, the UK-based public service television broadcasting company, bought the broadcasting rights from ICA, the UK distributor of the film. In July 2005, as the first Bangladeshi film it was on-air in UK television. The film was later televised in Argentina on 26 September 2006, and in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2006.
Critical reception.
"Matir Moina" mainly received positive reviews from critics, viewers and film connoisseurs, who commented on the film's historical and social impact. The film received an average rating of 4/5 on the movie review website Allmovie. The French film database AlloCiné has an average rating of 3.5/5 based on 13 reviews. On the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 89% based on 27 reviews, with a rating average of 7.57/10. The site's critical consensus reads, it "has a kind of twofold eloquence." Metacritic, which gave its reviews a weighted average rating, with the film scoring 75 based on 14 critics, including "generally favorable reviews".
Peter Bradshaw of "The Guardian" said, "The film offers a valuable and independent engagement with Muslim history, quite different from the ugly fight-to-the-finish promoted elsewhere in the media, and constitutes a nuanced riposte both to the dogmatic verities of religion and also to a species of Islamophobia that assumes the Muslim world to be crudely monolithic. ..It is one of the films of the year." According to "The Washington Post"s Ann Hornaday, the low-cost film captures the lyricism of life in Bangladesh's waterways and cities, some scenes reminiscent of Jean Renoir's 1951 classic "Le Fleuve". Ty Burr of "The Boston Globe" stated that the connection between personal, political and spiritual instability is revealed with the pure imagination of the autopsy. American film critic Frank Scheck writes in "The Hollywood Reporter", the producers' clear sympathy for the film's characters and close knowledge of its subject matter makes the film come alive. Michael O'Sullivan commented in a review of "The Washington Post" that "The Clay Bird" hits a number of beautiful and lazy trends about the human condition. According to Eric Monder of "Film Journal International", the film is somewhat restrained for its own drama, but at least for a contemporary audience, it sheds light on a significant part of world history. Marty Mapes of "Movie Habit" comments that the film is a good piece of armchair anthropology. American film historian and critic Elias Savada said, ""The Clay Bird" is a incredibly humbling experience." American writer and film critic Phil Hall stated in "Film Threat", it a great film in Bangladesh. American journalist and historian Elliott Stein said, ""The Clay Bird" recalls the empathy for childhood's innocence and lust for living—as well as the visual rapture and naturalness—of Satyajit Ray's great Pather Panchali." According to the BBC's Jamie Russell, Anu skillfully created an increasingly gentle portrait of Masud during his transition through childhood. According to Sean Axmaker of "Seattle Post-Intelligencer", the film is a timeless work with clear and elusive and almost historical features. Jamal Malik, a professor of German Islamic Studies of Pakistani descent, said the story of "Matir Moina" is presented in a textual structure similar to European art cinema. Indian filmmaker Aparna Sen praises the film.
Accolades.
Tareque Masud was commemorated on Google Doodle on 6 December 2016, on his 60th birthday. Where an iconic bird represents the film "Matir Moina".
Home media.
On 16 June 2004, the film was released on DVD (only for Region 2) by its French producer, distributor and world sales representative mk2 under Warner Bros. Home Entertainment France. VCD and DVD versions of the film was released in Bangladesh on 15 April 2005 from Laser Vision. Which includes an additional two-hours documentary, featuring scenes, interviews and audience feedback. It is considered as the first interactive DVD in Bangladesh.
The film was released in DVD version in late 2005 by its North American distributor Milestone Films.

First Hen (Fabergé egg)

The First Hen egg or Jeweled Hen egg is an Imperial Fabergé egg. It became the first in a series of more than 50 such jeweled eggs made under the supervision of Peter Carl Fabergé for the Russian Imperial family. It was delivered to Tsar Alexander III and given to his wife Maria Feodorovna in 1885. The tsarina enjoyed the egg so much that Alexander III quickly placed a standing order with Fabergé to create a new egg for his wife every Easter thereafter, requiring only that each egg be unique and that it contain some kind of "surprise" within it. This particular egg is now a part of the permanent collection of the Fabergé Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
Design.
While Fabergé was the owner of his workshop and while all of the eggs produced there are considered "Fabergé eggs", Fabergé himself is not known to have ever participated in the actual construction of any of them, even the first. The crafting of the first Imperial egg is instead attributed to Erik Kollin of Fabergé's workshop. It is made of gold completely coated with opaque white enamel to look like a real egg. A thin band of gold where the two halves of the shell are joined is visible around the middle of the egg.
Surprise.
The two halves of the outer shell fit together in a bayonet-style fitting which opens when twisted to reveal the egg's "surprise", a round "yolk" of gold with a matte finish. This yolk itself opens to reveal a varicolored gold hen set with ruby eyes. The hen is hinged on the tail feathers which allows it to also open up to reveal still two further surprises, a gold and diamond replica of the imperial crown and a tiny ruby pendant that was suspended within it on a chain, both of which are now lost.
History.
Egg ordered by the Tsar.
In the 19th century, Russian Orthodox Christians held Easter as the most important day of the year. Following a strict fast throughout all of Great Lent, Easter was a day of celebration of Christ's resurrection. To celebrate this holiday, Tsar Alexander III's brother, the Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich ordered Peter Fabergé to create an Easter surprise for the Tsarina. Correspondence between the Tsar and his brother dated March 21, 1885 indicates the Grand Duke relayed the Tsar's desires and instructions for the gift to Fabergé rather than the Tsar himself supervising the crafting of the egg. Amid terrorist attempts on the Imperial family's lives, the Tsar wanted to give his wife something that would take her mind off worries for the Easter of 1885. Fabergé created an egg inspired by one the Tsarina knew from her childhood as a princess of Denmark's royal court. The egg, still in the Royal Danish Collection, is made of ivory instead of gold, has a ring instead of a pendant inside, and dates to the 18th century. Fabergé undoubtedly chose the design because the Tsarina would have recognized the design from her youth. The design delighted both the Tsar and Tsarina so much the Alexander III ordered one for the next Easter and granted Fabergé "permission...to bear the title Supplier to the Imperial Court with the right to bear the State Coat of Arms in his shop's sign".
History after presentation to Tsarina.
The Tsarina was impressed and delighted by the Easter gift from her husband. The egg was kept in the Anichkov Palace until the 1917 revolutions. At that time the revolutionaries seized the First Hen Egg along with most of the other imperial eggs and sent it to the Armory Palace of the Kremlin. A London dealer named either Derek or Frederick Berry purchased the egg from Russian officials around 1920, probably in either Berlin or Paris. Christie's of London sold the egg as lot 55 of the Berry Collection for £85 ($430) to Mr Alfred Suenson-Taylor in 1934. Taylor was made Lord Grantchester in 1955, and the egg formed part of the Grantchester estate when both Lord and Lady Taylor died within months of one another in 1976. A La Vieille Russie of New York acquired the egg from the estate and sold it, together with the Resurrection Egg, to Forbes Magazine Collection in 1978. Viktor Vekselberg purchased the First Hen Egg along with eight other imperial eggs from Forbes, together with the entire Forbes Fabergé collection, before they were to be auctioned. Vekselberg then returned the eggs to Russia where they are now on display in the Fabergé Museum in Saint Petersburg.

Hen with Sapphire Pendant (Fabergé egg)

The Hen with Sapphire Pendant egg or Egg with Hen in Basket is an Imperial Fabergé egg, one in a series of fifty-two jeweled eggs made under the supervision of Peter Carl Fabergé for the Russian Imperial family. It was created in 1886 for Alexander III of Russia, who presented it to his wife, the Empress Maria Feodorovna. It is one of six imperial eggs that are currently lost.
Design.
The exact design of this egg is not known as there are no known photographs or illustrations of the egg and written descriptions of the egg sometimes conflict with one another. 
The present is described as "a hen of gold and rose diamonds taking a sapphire egg out of a nest" in the imperial archive dated February 15, 1886 through April 24, 1886. 
The sapphire egg was loosely held in the hen's beak. The hen and the basket were both made of gold, studded with hundreds of rose-cut diamonds. 
The archive of the Russian Provisional Government describes the hen as being silver on a stand of gold, though this description is probably in error since the orders for the 1886 Tsar egg specifically stated the present was to be made of gold.
Surprise.
The surprise was not documented and is unlikely to be discovered as the egg's current whereabouts are unknown.
History.
The Sapphire Pendant Egg was sent to Tsar Alexander III on April 5, 1886 from Fabergé's workshop. The egg was presented by the Tsar to Tsarina Marie Fedorovna on April 13 of the same year. The egg was housed in the Anichkov Palace until the Revolution. The last documented location of the egg is from the archive of the provisional government's inventory in 1922 when the egg was held in the Armory Palace of the Kremlin. It is not known whether the egg was lost or is currently in private hands.

Francisco A. de Icaza

Francisco de Asís de Icaza y Beña (born 2 February 1863 in Mexico City, Mexico – d. 28 May 1925 in Madrid, Spain) was a Mexican poet, literary critic, and historian of literature who spent most of his adult career and life in Spain. He was the father of Carmen de Icaza, VIII Baronesa de Claret, a popular Spanish novelist.
Biography.
Francisco Asís de Icaza y Beña was born on 2 February 1863 in Mexico City, Mexico, son of Ignacio de Icaza e Iturbe and María Tomasa Beña y García.
In his twenties he was posted to the Mexican legation in Madrid, during the embassy of his friend Vicente Riva Palacio; he became ambassador to Germany and to Spain.
Known at first for his poetry, Icaza achieved some notoriety with his "Examen de críticos" (1894). His scholarly analysis "Novelas ejemplares de Cervantes" (1901), examining Miguel de Cervantes's work in "Novelas ejemplares", was acclaimed and gained him membership in the Ateneo de Madrid. He published scholarly works of literary history and was a corresponding member of the Mexican and Spanish Academies.
In addition to his works on Cervantes and Lope de Vega, Icaza translated into Spanish various works by Nietzsche, Hebbel, Liliencron and Dehmel.
A visit to his homeland was marred by the nationalist polemic that surrounded his critical "Diccionario autobiográfico de conquistadores y pobladores de la Nueva España" (Madrid, 1923).
In Spain, Icaza married the young Beatriz de León y Loynaz (1878–1971), born in La Habana and niece of a Spanish aristocrat. The couple had six children, including novelist Carmen de Icaza.

SpaceCub

SpaceCub was a design project for a homebuilt rocket. Between 1993 and 1994, Geoffrey A. Landis proposed that a vehicle designed to launch to the edge of space might be a feasible project for a "personal" spaceship, the equivalent of a Piper Cub for space. The insight was that a flight to "only" 100 km would reach the officially defined edge of space, and even though this is much easier a challenge than an orbital flight, such a suborbital flight would be of excitement to the public, and the pilot would be officially qualified as an astronaut. A small group of rocket enthusiasts, computer hobbyists, and science-fiction writers gathered together to do a preliminary design, with the ultimate goal of moving on to building a prototype, with (then) physics student David Burkhead leading the technical effort. The vehicle design was discussed in many venues, and presentations on the design progress were given in several conferences, such as the 1995 NSS International Space Development Conference, where it attracted considerable popular attention. The design was featured in print in places including the December 1994 Popular Mechanics, and the Brazilian popular magazine Istoé.
Although a full-scale prototype of the SpaceCub was never built, the design (and the publicity surrounding the project) brought public attention to the concept that a small vehicle to fly a private pilot into space might be possible, and in that way served to stimulate the X Prize, which adopted the SpaceCub's goal of a 100-km flight altitude as a target for a competition. In its way, the SpaceCub vehicle is a predecessor to many of today's concepts for space tourism.

Jean-Yves Empereur

Jean-Yves Empereur (; born 1952) is a French archeologist. He studied classic literature in the (DEA, CAPES, Agrégation de lettres in 1975, Doctorat in archeology in 1977).
He is a former member (since 1978) and general secretary (1982–2000) of the École française d'Athènes. He conducted some excavations, including some submarine ones, in Greece, Cyprus and Turkey, on the sites Thasos and Amathus.
He is a researcher from the CNRS, director of the (CEA) - Alexandria Studies Center that he founded in 1990, and since then he has led archeological research in Alexandria on earth and underwater.
Archeological excavations.
Empereur conducts emergency excavations in the Alexandria town center. The modern city was built over the ancient one, which means that the archaeological excavations become possible only when older buildings are taken down for civil works, for example. As an example of this recovery work, beautiful mosaics can be enjoyed at Diane field, a Roman villa from the 2nd century.
In 1993, a dyke was to be built on the supposed site of the lighthouse of Alexandria. Empereur, Jean-Pierre Corteggiani, and around thirty scuba divers then attempted a rescue operation by starting some excavations in a 2.25 ha zone situated north-east from Fort Qaitbay.
Until 1996, these excavations in Alexandria harbour led to the discovery of many archeological remains: 5,000 architectural blocks weighing up to 75 tons, columns, capitals, huge broken statues, a dozen sphinxes, and above all the indisputable remains of the lighthouse itself. A 12-metre door made of Aswan granite was virtually reassembled. Some gigantic statues that used to stand against the lighthouse, representing Ptolemaic kings and queens, were found right next to their pedestal. Empereur hopes that in the future this marvellous site will be open to amateur scuba divers.
In March 1997, the site of the Gabbari Necropolis, Alexandria's city of the dead, was discovered during the building of the bridge linking the western harbour to the Cairo road. The director of the museums and archeological sites of Alexandria asked for Empereur's help on June 27. The general map of the ancient city appeared then, with the streets following the drawings by Dinocrates, the first urbanist architect.
Filmography.
"Gédéon Programmes" produced a documentary trilogy about Empereur's work, directed by Thierry Ragobert:
Personal life.
In 2001 Empereur confronted video games publisher Eidos Interactive for using his image in the : The game's protagonist, Lara Croft, meets a friend of hers in Alexandria, who coincidentally resembled Jean-Yves Empereur, including having the same first name and profession. The publisher apologized and agreed to stop using the character in their games.

Linwood Female College

Linwood Female College was an American women's college associated with the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church (ARP). It was located at the foot of Crowders Mountain, near Gastonia, North Carolina. The school was also known as Jones' Seminary in its early years, and as Linwood College in its last years. The school was in operation from 1884 to 1921.
History.
Around 1884, Emily Prudden of Connecticut founded a school for white girls at the former site of All Healing Springs, a popular mineral springs resort. The former resort's grounds were also briefly used for an industrial school after the American Civil War. Prudden's school soon became the ARP-associated Jones Seminary, with the financial backing of Edwin S. Jones, a judge in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Cyrus Hampton ran the school from 1889 to 1898; the school closed for a year when Hampton retired for health reasons, but re-opened in the fall of 1900 with A. G. Kirkpatrick as its president. 
After the retirement of college president A. G. Kirkpatrick, the college was taken over by Archie Thompson Lindsay, a local ARP minister, and his brother, Ernest Lindsay. A year later, the Lindsays asked the student body to propose a new name for the college since it was no longer under the ownership of Judge Jones, and the all-female student body put together the name "Linwood" by honoring the president and the wooded area surrounding the school. The school had a campus of 325 acres near Crowders Mountain. 
The college operated as Linwood Female College from 1904 until 1915, when it became a coeducational school in an attempt to improve its financial situation. The name was then shortened to Linwood College. The college closed due to financial difficulties in 1921.
Faculty and alumni.
A. T. Lindsay announced that the 1907 faculty of Linwood Female College would include Frances Wideman as Lady Principal, with teachers Phronia Falls, Nell Orr, Bessie Boyce, Mary Copenhaver, Lucy Wallace, and Eleanor Gourdin, and Sallie Holland as one of the matrons. Eunice Riggins was selected Lady Principal of Linwood College in 1916.
Two notable alumni of Linwood were Ben Elbert Douglas Sr., who served as mayor of Charlotte, and Mary Beth Rowan Friday, mother of University of North Carolina system president William C. Friday. 
Legacy.
In 1931, the Greek Orthodox Church of America bought the old Linwood College campus, with plans to open a new college there. The school's site, now only a few building foundations, is within the boundaries of Crowders Mountain State Park.

Triplatin tetranitrate

Triplatin tetranitrate (rINN; also known as BBR3464, https://www.bioplatinumtech.com/) is a platinum-based cytotoxic drug that underwent clinical trials for the treatment of human cancer. The drug acts by forming adducts with cellular DNA, preventing DNA transcription and replication, thereby inducing apoptosis. Other platinum-containing anticancer drugs include cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin.
Drug development.
Triplatin belongs to the anticancer class of polynuclear platinum complexes (PPCs), developed in the laboratory of Professor Nicholas Farrell, where one or more platinum centers are linked by amine ligands. BBR3464 was patented in the mid-1990s and clinical development and licensing was performed initially by Boehringer Mannheim Italia and eventually by the pharmaceutical company Roche, when clinical development was led by Novuspharma. In preclinical trials it demonstrated cytotoxic activity in cancer cell lines that had either intrinsic or acquired resistance to cisplatin. Triplatin remains the only “non-classical” platinum drug (not based on the cisplatin structure) to have entered human clinical trials. Phase I and Phase II clinical results have been summarized.
Mode of action.
The main target of triplatin is cellular DNA, similar to cisplatin. The drug forms novel adducts with DNA, structurally distinct from those formed by cisplatin. More recently, cellular accumulation mediated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans and high-affinity glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding indicates that cationic PPCs are intrinsically dual-function agents, acting by mechanisms discrete from the neutral, mononuclear agents.
Side effects.
In phase I studies, when given once every 28 days, the main dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of Triplatin (BBR 3464) were neutropenia and diarrhea encountered at a dose level of 1.1 mg/m2. Diarrhea was treatable with loperamide. Lack of nephrotoxicity and low urinary excretion supported use of drug without hydration.

Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone

Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone (CDMT; brand name Oral Turinabol), also known as 4-chloro-17β-hydroxy17α-methylandrosta-1,4-dien-3-one, is an anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). It is the 4-chloro-substituted derivative of metandienone (dehydromethyltestosterone).
History.
CDMT was the first original product of Jenapharm, an East German pharmaceutical company. It was patented in 1961. The idea of combining the structures of 4-chlorotestosterone (clostebol) and metandienone originated with chemist Albert Stachowiak. At the time, this represented a unique dissociation of anabolic from androgenic effects after oral administration. The product was introduced for clinical use in 1965 and remained in use until 1994, when production was discontinued.
Society and culture.
Doping in sports.
CDMT was the key steroid administered to approximately ten thousand East German athletes as part of a secret doping program, known as State Plan Topic 14.25, often without them knowing the nature of the "vitamins" they were forced to take. The program remained in place from about 1968 until the collapse of the German Democratic Republic in 1989. In the 1990s, Franke and Berendonk examined GDR archives to elucidate the expansive scope of this operation, which had resulted in numerous medal wins and world-record performances.
Following allegations of widespread doping, the International Olympic Committee reanalyzed samples from the Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Olympic Games using the spectrometric method developed by Grigory Rodchenkov in 2011 for detecting long-lasting metabolites of CDMT. Weightlifters and sprinters in particular were found to have used CDMT.
In August 2017, UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones tested positive for turinabol following his victory over Daniel Cormier at UFC 214 the month prior.
Colorado Rockies third baseman Colton Welker tested positive in May 2021 while playing for the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes. He was suspended for eighty games.

Tara River Canyon

The Tara River Canyon (, ; ), also known as the Tara River Gorge, is the river canyon of the Tara river. It is for the most part located in Montenegro, and to a smaller extent in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The most attractive part of the canyon are the high rocks of the mountain range of Ljubišnja, which are located in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Durmitor National Park. Known as "The Tear of Europe," the Tara River Gorge stands as the second deepest canyon in Europe behind the Sulak Canyon, and also behind the Grand Canyon for third deepest globally.
Geography.
The park's right and left sides from the point of Crna Poda near the town of Mojkovac belong to the Municipality of Pljevlja. The canyon stretches from near Bistrica in Montenegro to Hum in Bosnia and Herzegovina, over . The last 36 kilometers form the border between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. The canyon is up to deep. Tara River Canyon is one of the deepest river canyons in Europe.
Within Montenegro the canyon is protected as a part of Durmitor National Park and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The canyon features rocky and pebbly terraces, sandy beaches, high cliffs, and more than 80 large caves.
Tara River.
The Tara River becomes the Drina at the point of confluence with the Piva near Hum, and is some hundred and fifty kilometers long at that point. In the park, the river has a mean fall of 3.6 meters/kilometer, with a host of cascades, offering whitewater between category 2 and 4.
Extending over 158 kilometers, the Tara River welcomes contributions from 14 rivers, boasting 69 rapids and over 40 cascades, including the prominent Crna Vrela, Bijela Vrela, Djavolje Lazi, Sokolovina, and Bijeli Kamen. The river gets large quantities of water from abundant wellsprings and a few short tributaries. The most important left bank tributaries are the Ljutica and the Sušica, while the most important right bank tributaries are the Vaskovaćka Rijeka and the Draga. The most important wellspring is the Bajlovića Sige, located on the right bank, contributing a few hundred liters per second. The water pouring from the Bučevica Cave falls into the Tara more than thirty metres high, and more than a hundred and fifty meters wide. 
The roar from the cascades can be heard from the canyon peaks. Among the more than forty cascades, the most famous are Đavolje Lazi, Sokolovina, Bijeli Kamen, Gornji Tepački Buk and Donji Tepački Buk. 
Because of the quality of its water, and because of its unique ecological system, Tara River Gorge earned UNESCO recognition in 1977 as part of the "Man and Biosphere" program (“Čovjek i biosfera”) and entered into the world's ecological biosphere reservations, protecting it under an international convention.
The river, together with the Drina river, is Europe's main habitat and spawning ground for huchen (Hucho hucho).
Dam controversy.
The governments of Montenegro and the Republika Srpska entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina had plans to flood a considerable part of the gorge, to construct one or more hydroelectric dams on the Drina and possibly the Tara. A plan to construct dams in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the Drina river, has not been abandoned. 
One proposed dam at Buk Bijela village, some 15 kilometers downstream of border with Montenegro and the confluence of the Tara with the Piva river, the Buk Bijela Hydro Power Plant, although apparently abandoned in April 2005 after successful protests, was reconsidered as recently as 2018. A concession was given to HE Buk Bijela company created in Foča in 2018. A September 2006 cooperation agreement between Slovenian company Petrol and Montenegrin company Montenegro-bonus specified construction of a 40–60 megawatt hydroelectric plant.
Water sports.
The canyon is part of the Tara River rafting route. The one-day rafting route runs from Brstnovica to Sćepan Polje. It is  miles long. This part of the canyon has the steepest drop in elevation. It includes 21 out of 50 rapids in that part of the Tara. The rapids are Brstanovići, Pećine, Celije and Vjernovički. The longer rafting route covers . The route begins with the waterfalls of Ljutica and passes under the 541 feet high monumental bridge. Next is the old Roman road and the Lever Tara. "Funjički Bukovi" and "Bijele Ploče" rapids are followed by "Nisovo Vrelo", the deepest part of the canyon. Further is the bottom of Curevac mountain that reaches .
In 2005 and 2009, the European Championships in Rafting were held in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the Vrbas and Tara rivers.

Marco's Millions

Marco's Millions (2001) is a science fiction novel by William Sleator. It is a prequel to the main book, "The Boxes".
Plot.
The protagonist is a boy named Marco who likes to travel. He often secretly rides buses far from home, though only his telepathic sister finds out. One day, his sister sees strange lights in the basement, and she and Marco investigate. They find a portal into another dimension, and thus the adventure begins. Marco finds strange insect-like creatures there, who are convinced that Marco/Lilly can save their dimension (and as a result save Earth) from their god, which is a naked singularity. None of their family members know about this portal, so Lily and Marco secretly need to save this dimension. Time is valued differently than on Earth in that universe, as 1 minute on the other dimension is roughly 21 minutes on Earth. Saving the other dimension would mean being missing for several days on Earth. So, Marco tells his parents he going to his friend Nat's for vacation, while he'll actually be in the other dimension. The creatures (who communicate telepathically) tell Marco he must go on a giant swing and retrieve a small bag at the very top. This will be risking Marco's life. He retrieves the bag and brings it back to the ground. Next, he must go to the naked singularity and bribe it not to destroy the universe by giving it the bag's contents. The singularity values the contents very much and says it will not destroy the universe, but with one cost (continued in The Boxes).
Reception.
Roger Sutton in his review for "Horn Book Magazine" said "while the book has the far-out ideas and expert pace that Sleator's fans admire, there's an added dimension of poignancy in the character of Marco, both in his intense bond with his sister Lilly and in his restlessness: obsessed with travel even as a young child, intently riding buses and trains, he has, by the time he reappears as an adult in "The Boxes", become something of an intergalactic Flying Dutchman." Diane Roback in her review for "Publishers Weekly" said that this novel was "more satisfying than its predecessor, and full of strange and startling details, this curious fantasy will spark readers' imaginations and send them right back to "The Boxes" for a glimpse of Marco's future." Trevelyn E. Jones in his review for "School Library Journal" said that "Marco is a substantial protagonist; the other characters, while less well-rounded, are convincing enough to advance the story. The book is a successful prequel to Sleator's "The Boxes" (Dutton, 1998), but also stands on its own."
Sequel.
The Boxes and Marco's Million's series was supposed to have a third book but was never made. In an email to a fan in 2006, he wrote the following:
"Some day I would like to write a third book in that series, called
MAD MARTHA. Of course it is about Aunt Martha being mad at Marco for
stealing her box.
But my editor says sequels never sell as well as the original. So I
don't know when this will happen."
It is unknown if any of the book was written down at any time.

Mephisto (1981 film)

Mephisto is a 1981 German-language political drama film co-written and directed by István Szabó, and based on the novel of the same name by Klaus Mann. It stars Klaus Maria Brandauer as a German stage actor (modelled on Gustaf Gründgens) who finds unexpected success and mixed blessings in the popularity of his performance in a Faustian play as the Nazis take power in pre-Second World War Germany. As his associates and friends flee or are forced underground by the Nazi regime, the popularity of his character ends up superseding his own existence, until he finds that his best performance is keeping up appearances for his Nazi patrons.
The film was a co-production of Hungarian, Austrian, and West German studios; starring German and Hungarian-speaking actors. It premiered in Budapest on 11 February 1981 and received widespread acclaim from critics, winning the Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film, the first Hungarian picture to do so. Brandauer's performance earned him many accolades, including BAFTA and German Film Award nominations and launched his film career.
Plot.
The film adapts the story of Mephistopheles and Doctor Faustus by revealing the costs to the main character Hendrik Höfgen as he abandons his conscience and continues to perform, ingratiating himself with the Nazi Party to keep his job and improve his social position.
Höfgen (modelled on German actor Gustaf Gründgens) craves center stage. The first third of the film follows his career as a frustrated, passionate actor slogging it out in provincial theaters, occasionally dancing and singing and doing parts in films to gain notice. He even founds a Bolshevik theater with a friend to generate more work, in the avant-garde period of the early 1930s, before the Nazis came to power. Initially, Hendrik is more successful in his social and love life than as an actor. Both strands unite when his new wife watches him play the ultimate role, Mephisto (the devil's agent in the Faustus play), just before the Nazi party came to power in Germany.
While his wife, leading actors, and friends go into exile, or protest against the new regime, Hendrik returns to Germany lured by the promise of forgiveness for his communist theatre escapade and a desire to act in his native language. When the Nazi party offers to make him a star, he doesn't hesitate. Great roles and accolades quickly come his way, and Hendrik revels in his success. Hendrik reprises his greatest role as Mephisto and agrees to run the national theatre, working around the cultural restrictions and brutality of the Nazi government. He blithely overlooks the profound moral compromises of his situation, excusing himself by using the power of his close relationships with Nazi officials to help friends who would otherwise be targeted by the regime.
The plot's bitter irony is that the protagonist's fondest dream is to become Germany's greatest actor, playing Hamlet and Mephisto but to achieve this dream he sells his soul and realizes too late that he is not playing the role of Mephisto but that of Faustus; it is the Nazi leader with a major role in the film (modeled on Hermann Göring) who is the real Mephisto.
Reception.
The film was the highest-grossing Hungarian film in the United States and Canada with a gross of $3.9 million.
Awards and nominations.
"Mephisto" was the first Hungarian film to win the Foreign Language Oscar, and the only one until "Son of Saul" won in 2016. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 76% based on 25 reviews, with an average score of 7.40/10.

Leg-yield

The leg-yield is a lateral movement in which a horse travels both forward and sideways at the same time. The horse is fairly straight through his body in the leg-yield, although he may have a slight bend opposite to the direction of travel. It is one of the "three initial movements leading up to true lateral work", the others being the turn on the forehand and the shoulder-fore.
Difference from the half-pass.
The leg-yield and half-pass are sometimes confused because they are both movements in which the horse goes forward and sideways. However, the half-pass is quite a bit more advanced, requiring greater balance, engagement, and collection from the horse. In the leg-yield, the horse is fairly straight or bent slightly away from the direction of travel. In the half-pass, the horse is bent "towards" the direction of travel, which is physically much more difficult for the horse.
Uses and disadvantages.
The leg-yield is one of the first lateral exercises to be introduced to a horse, teaching it a simple yet valuable lesson: to move sideways away from leg pressure. This basic is later built upon in the shoulder-in and haunches-in.
Some trainers do not believe that the leg-yield is a particularly useful exercise after this concept has been taught, falling short when compared to such exercises as the shoulder-in. However, in modern dressage training it is generally held that the leg-yield is a valuable tool for suppling a stiff horse, straightening a crooked horse, and preparing a lower-level horse for more advanced work. The leg-yield is a required movement in the First Level dressage test.
Another use of the leg-yield is in the rider's training, as it is a fairly basic move yet can begin to teach the rider how to use the riding aids independently and bring the horse properly into the outside rein and leg.
Improper execution of the leg-yield can have a negative effect on a horse's training, causing loss of forwardness, resulting in short, broken gaits. The Spanish Riding School uses this exercise sparingly, and only at the walk, when first teaching the horse to move away from the leg. Because the horse will be bent in the opposite direction learning the more difficult half-pass, it is believed to be counterproductive to spend much time on the leg-yield. However, when used judiciously and correctly, the leg-yield is a beneficial exercise.
Different ways to leg-yield.
The most common place the leg-yield is performed is from quarter line to rail, keeping the horse's body parallel to the wall. With more advanced horses, leg-yielding can be performed back to the quarterline.
The second way the leg-yield is commonly performed is with the horse's nose facing the rail, with its body at no more than a 30-degree angle to the wall. The horse may also be leg-yielded with haunches to the wall. Unlike shoulder- or haunches-in, the horse does not have the same degree of bend. These are not' the same movements. The horse may also be leg-yielded on a diagonal, keeping his body straight.
The last form of leg-yielding is much more advanced, and is not commonly practised. In this movement, the horse is leg-yielded on a volte, with his nose facing the center of the circle.

Froggy the Gremlin

Froggy the Gremlin was a character created by Smilin' Ed McConnell and brought to radio in the 1940s and television in 1950s on the "Smilin' Ed's Gang" show, and later "Andy's Gang" TV show, hosted by actor Andy Devine after McConnell's death.
The character.
Froggy was a troublemaker. Disrespectful of adult authority figures, Froggy played practical jokes and disrupted the presentations of other guests. If a guest were to demonstrate how to paint a wall, he might say, "And now I'm going to take this can of paint..." Froggy would chime in, "And dump it over my head." And the confused guest would proceed to do so.
On radio and the early TV shows, Froggy's voice was frequently supplied by Arch ("Archie") Presby, who was also the program's announcer.
He appeared on screen in a puff of smoke with the catchphrase, "Hiya, kids! Hiya hiya hiya hiya!" The human host had another catchphrase, directed to Froggy, "Plunk your magic twanger, Froggy!" Followed by a "twangayangayang" sound. On radio, it was then followed by a raspberry. Froggy would appear atop an armoir.

<doc id="6997798" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6997798" title="Gastrocolic reflex">
Gastrocolic reflex

The gastrocolic reflex or gastrocolic response is a physiological reflex that controls the motility, or peristalsis, of the gastrointestinal tract following a meal. It involves an increase in motility of the colon consisting primarily of giant migrating contractions, in response to stretch in the stomach following ingestion and byproducts of digestion entering the small intestine. The reflex propels existing intestinal contents through the digestive system helps make way for ingested food, and is responsible for the urge to defecate following a meal.
Physiology.
An increase in electrical activity is seen as little as 15 minutes after eating. The gastrocolic reflex is unevenly distributed throughout the colon, with the sigmoid colon exhibiting a greater phasic response to propel food distally into the rectum; however, the tonic response across the colon is uncertain. Increased pressure within the rectum acts as stimulus for defecation. Small intestine motility is also increased in response to the gastrocolic reflex.
These contractions are generated by the muscularis externa stimulated by the myenteric plexus. A number of neuropeptides have been proposed as mediators of the gastrocolic reflex. These include serotonin, neurotensin, cholecystokinin, prostaglandin E1, and gastrin.
Clinical significance.
Clinically, the gastrocolic reflex has been implicated in pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): the very act of eating or drinking can provoke an overreaction of the gastrocolic response in some patients with IBS due to their heightened visceral sensitivity, and this can lead to abdominal pain and distension, flatulence, and diarrhea. The gastrocolic reflex has also been implicated in pathogenesis of functional constipation, where patients with spinal cord injury and diabetics with gastroparesis secondary to diabetic neuropathy have an increased colonic transit time.
The gastrocolic reflex can also be used to optimise the treatment of constipation. Since the reflex is most active in the mornings and immediately after meals, consumption of stimulant laxatives, such as sennosides and bisacodyl, during these times will augment the reflex and help increase colonic contractions and therefore defecation.

Enterogastric reflex

The enterogastric reflex is one of the three extrinsic reflexes of the gastrointestinal tract, the other two being the gastroileal reflex and the gastrocolic reflex. The enterogastric reflex is stimulated by duodenal distension. It can also be stimulated by a pH of 3-4 in the duodenum and by a pH of 1.5 in the stomach. Upon initiation of the reflex, the release of gastrin by G-cells in the antrum of the stomach is shut off. This in turn inhibits gastric motility and the secretion of gastric acid (HCl).
Emptying inhibitory factors.
The stomach's contents are inhibited from emptying into the small intestine by:
Emptying stimulatory factors.
The stomach's contents empty through the pylorus, allowing digestion to proceed, when there is:

Toby Meltzer

Toby R. Meltzer (born September 19, 1957) is an American plastic and reconstructive surgeon. Meltzer specializes in sex reassignment surgery male-to-female, sex reassignment surgery female-to-male, and facial feminization surgery. In the 1990s, Meltzer pioneered the neovaginal construction technique that increased the ability of the neoclitoris to feel sensations. According to his website, Meltzer performs 2-4 vaginoplasties a week, and that he has performed over 3000 male and female sexual reassignment (SRS) surgeries. Joan Roughgarden called Meltzer one of the leading surgeons in this specialized field. He practices in Scottsdale, Arizona.
Education and early practice.
Meltzer is a graduate of the Louisiana State University school of medicine, where he completed a residency in general surgery. He completed his plastic surgery residency at the University of Michigan. Meltzer then began his practice, while working as a clinical professor of plastic surgery at Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU). There he specialized in general surgery, plastic surgery, and completed a fellowship in surgery for treatment of severe burn injuries.
Working with the chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Division at OHSU, he began training in SRS surgical techniques. Meltzer researched and interviewed pediatric urologists with experience treating children born with ambiguous genitalia, and surgeons already performing vaginoplasty surgeries such as the late Stanley Biber. In 1993 he began performing vaginoplasty surgeries, which eventually became a large part of his practice. In 1996, he opened his own private practice in Portland, Oregon. In 2003, he relocated his practice to Scottsdale, Arizona, in 2003 becoming the first doctor in that state to specialize in gender reconstruction surgery.
Meltzer was forced to relocate to Scottsdale after a conservative physicians consortium, Symphony Healthcare, purchased Eastmoreland Hospital. Meltzer was reportedly forced out due to Symphony's hefty price increase, that some claim was a ruse due to the conservative corporation's objections to sexual reassignment surgery. According to reports, Meltzer's surgeries accounted for 50 percent of the hospital's revenue. Symphony Healthcare filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection less than two years later.
Surgical practice.
During the 1990s, during his practice in Portland Meltzer developed a vaginoplasty technique. Meltzer's demeanor and surgical skills gained him respect in the transgender community as he was considered having surpassed the veteran Stanley Biber in terms of referrals. He is also one of just a few surgeons in the U.S. who performs metiodioplasty procedures to create male genitalia for FTM trans men.
In the late 1990s, Meltzer performed many cricothyroid approximation surgeries. This procedure attempts to raise vocal pitch by surgically modifying the cricoid and thyroid cartilage structures. The intent of the procedure is to raise the vocal pitch of patients unable to do so through voice training. Improved voice training methods (which often produce better results than the surgery) and the inherent risks of vocal surgery have largely eliminated the demand for cricothyroid approximation.
According to his website, Meltzer performs facial feminization surgery (FFS), and is available to provide: mandibular angle osteotomy, genioplasty, cranioplasty, scalp advancement, trachea reduction, and other feminizing procedures. Also aspects of his practice are: reconstruction of severed limbs, scar revision surgeries, and more familiar plastic surgical procedures such as breast augmentation.

Kiss the Dirt (Falling Down the Mountain)

"Kiss the Dirt (Falling Down the Mountain)" is a song by the Australian rock band INXS. It was written by Andrew Farriss and Michael Hutchence from the 1985 album "Listen Like Thieves".
It was released as the album's third single in March 1986 and reached number 15 on the Australian singles chart, becoming the band's tenth top 20 hit in their country. It was, however, the band's seventh single that failed to chart in the United States, but it did manage to reach number 24 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.
In 2002, "Kiss the Dirt (Falling Down the Mountain)" was included on the soundtrack of the popular and critically acclaimed Rockstar video game "" on its in-game radio station "Flash FM".
The music video shows the band performing on a salt lake and on the moon plains in Coober Pedy in South Australia. The band flew direct from the United States to the site and filmed the clip overnight then flew back to the United States. In the bridge, the band is shown performing while fire and gloom cover the area, before the skies clear up at the end. It was directed by Alex Proyas.
