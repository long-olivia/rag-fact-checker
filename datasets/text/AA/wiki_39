Peter Clentzos

Panagiotis D. "Peter" Clentzos (June 15, 1909 in Oakland, California — September 11, 2006 in Rancho Mirage, California) was an American pole vaulter and the son of Greek immigrants who competed for Greece in the 1932 Summer Olympics.
Clentzos was born in Oakland, California. His father, a carpenter, and his mother had emigrated to the United States from Kythera, an island in Greece.
Clentzos attended the University of Southern California, where he was a member of the track and field team. For three years he lettered on the USC team coached by Dean Cromwell and that won NCAA team titles in 1930 and 1931.
He tried out as a pole vaulter for the United States team in the 1932 Olympics, but fell just short of qualifying. His Greek heritage allowed him to vie for one of the 16 spots on Greece's team.
Clentzos' personal best in the pole vault competition was 13 feet, 9 inches. In the event at the 1932 Olympics, however, he cleared only 12 feet 3.5 inches, earning him seventh place.
After graduating from USC, Clentzos taught history and woodworking, which he had learned from his father, at Barstow High School in Barstow, California. He also coached the football and track teams.
During World War II he joined the U.S. Army and was assigned to the Santa Ana Army Air Base as a physical education instructor.
After the war, Clentzos and his wife Helen moved to Pasadena, California, where he initially worked as a teacher and coach at Roosevelt High School. He later served as an administrator at Narbonne High School and Boys Vice-Principal at Franklin High School in Northeast Los Angeles.
Clentzos was co-founder and meet announcer at the Pasadena/Crown Valley Senior Olympics until shortly before his death. He was given the Senior Service Award by the Pasadena Senior Center in 2004.
Clentzos attended the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens as a guest of the government of Greece. He also ran a leg of the Olympic torch relay that year.
Clentzos died in Rancho Mirage, California at Eisenhower Medical Center. His death was attributed to complications from hip surgery.

KCNE1

Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "KCNE1" gene.
Voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume.
KCNE1 is one of five members of the KCNE family of Kv channel ancillary or β subunits. It is also known as minK (minimal potassium channel subunit).
Function.
KCNE1 is primarily known for modulating the cardiac and epithelial Kv channel alfa subunit, KCNQ1. KCNQ1 and KCNE1 form a complex in human ventricular cardiomyocytes that generates the slowly activating K+ current, IKs. Together with the rapidly activating K+ current (IKr), IKs is important for human ventricular repolarization. KCNQ1 is also essential for the normal function of many different epithelial tissues, but in these non-excitable cells it is thought to be predominantly regulated by KCNE2 or KCNE3.
KCNE1 slows the activation of KCNQ1 5-10 fold, increases its unitary conductance 4-fold, eliminates its inactivation, and alters the manner in which KCNQ1 is regulated by other proteins, lipids and small molecules. The association of KCNE1 with KCNQ1 was discovered 8 years after Takumi and colleagues reported the isolation of a fraction of RNA from rat kidney that, when injected into "Xenopus" oocytes, produced an unusually slow-activating, voltage-dependent, potassium-selective current. Takumi "et al" discovered the KCNE1 gene and it was correctly predicted to encode a single-transmembrane domain protein with an extracellular N-terminal domain and a cytosolic C-terminal domain. The ability of KCNE1 to generate this current was confusing because of its simple primary structure and topology, contrasting with the 6-transmembrane domain topology of other known Kv α subunits such as "Shaker" from "Drosophila", cloned 2 years earlier. The mystery was solved when KCNQ1 was cloned and found to co-assemble with KCNE1, and it was shown that "Xenopus laevis" oocytes endogenously express KCNQ1, which is upregulated by exogenous expression of KCNE1 to generate the characteristic slowly activating current., KCNQ1 is also essential for the normal function of many different epithelial tissues, but in these non-excitable cells it is thought to be predominantly regulated by KCNE2 or KCNE3.
KCNE1 is also reported to regulate two other KCNQ family α subunits, KCNQ4 and KCNQ5. KCNE1 increased both their peak currents in oocyte expression studies, and slowed the activation of the latter.,
KCNE1 also regulates hERG, which is the Kv α subunit that generates ventricular IKr. KCNE1 doubled hERG current when the two were expressed in mammalian cells, although the mechanism for this remains unknown.
Although KCNE1 had no effect when co-expressed with the Kv1.1 α subunit in Chinese Hamster ovary (CHO) cells, KCNE1 traps the N-type (rapidly inactivating) Kv1.4 α subunit in the ER/Golgi when co-expressed with it. KCNE1 (and KCNE2) also has this effect on the two other canonical N-type Kv α subunits, Kv3.3 and Kv3.4. This appears to be a mechanism for ensuring that homomeric N-type channels do not reach the cell surface, as this mode of suppression by KCNE1 or KCNE2 is relieved by co-expression of same-subfamily delayed rectifier (slowly inactivating) α subunits. Thus, Kv1.1 rescued Kv1.4, Kv3.1 rescued Kv3.4; in each of these cases the resultant channels at the membrane were heteromers (e.g., Kv3.1-Kv3.4) and displayed intermediate inactivation kinetics to those of either α subunit alone.,
KCNE1 also regulates the gating kinetics of Kv2.1, Kv3.1 and Kv3.2, in each case slowing their activation and deactivation, and accelerating inactivation of the latter two., No effects were observed upon oocyte co-expression of KCNE1 and Kv4.2, but KCNE1 was found to slow the gating and increase macroscopic current of Kv4.3 in HEK cells. In contrast, channels formed by Kv4.3 and the cytosolic ancillary subunit KChIP2 exhibited faster activation and altered inactivation when co-expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells. Finally, KCNE1 inhibited Kv12.2 in "Xenopus" oocytes.
Structure.
The large majority of studies into the structural basis for KCNE1 modulation of Kv channels focus on its interaction with KCNQ1 (previously named KvLQT1). Residues in the transmembrane domain of KCNE1 lies close to the selectivity filter of KCNQ1 within heteromeric KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel complexes., The C-terminal domain of KCNE1, specifically from amino acids 73 to 79 is necessary for stimulation of slow delayed potassium rectifier current by SGK1. The interaction of KCNE1 with an alpha helix in the S6 KvLQT1 domain contributes to the higher affinity this channel has for benzodiazepine L7 and chromanol 293B by repositioning amino acid residues to allow for this. KCNE1 destabilizes the S4-S5 alpha-helix linkage in the KCNQ1 channel protein in addition to destabilizing the S6 alpha helix, leading to slower activation of this channel when associated with KCNE1. Variable stohiometries have been discussed but there are probably 2 KCNE1 subunits and 4 KCNQ1 subunits in a plasma membrane IKs complex.
The transmembrane segment of KCNE1 is α-helical when in a membrane environment., The transmembrane segment of KCNE1 has been suggested to interact with the KCNQ1 pore domain (S5/S6) and with the S4 domain of the KCNQ1 (KvLQT1) channel. KCNE1 may bind to the outer part of the KCNQ1 pore domain, and slide from this position into the “activation cleft” which leads to greater current amplitudes
KCNE1 slows KCNQ1 activation several-fold, and there are ongoing discussions about the precise mechanisms underlying this. In a study in which KCNQ1 voltage sensor movement was monitored by site-directed fluorimetry and also by measuring the charge displacement associated with movement of charges within the S4 segment of the voltage sensor (gating current), KCNE1 was found to slow S4 movement so much that the gating current was no longer measurable. Fluorimetry measurements indicated that KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel S4 movement was 30-fold slower than that of the well-studied "Drosophila" "Shaker" Kv channel. Nakajo and Kubo found that KCNE1 either slowed KCNQ1 S4 movement upon membrane depolarization, or altered S4 equilibrium at a given membrane potential. The Kass lab deduced that while homomeric KCNQ1 channels can open after the movement of a single S4 segment, KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels can only open after all four S4 segments have been activated. The intracellular C-terminal domain of KCNE1 is thought to sit on the KCNQ1 S4-S5 linker, a segment of KCNQ1 crucial for communicating S4 status to the pore and thus control activation.
Tissue distribution.
KCNE1 is expressed in human heart (atria and ventricles), whereas in adult mouse heart its expression appears limited to the atria and/or conduction system. KCNE1 is also expressed in human and musine inner ear and kidneys. KCNE1 has been detected in mouse brain but this finding is a subject of ongoing debate.
Clinical significance.
Inherited or sporadic KCNE gene mutations can cause Romano–Ward syndrome (heterozygotes) and Jervell Lange-Nielsens syndrome (homozygotes). Both these syndromes are characterized by Long QT syndrome, a delay in ventricular repolarization. In addition, Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome also involves bilateral sensorineural deafness. Mutation D76N in the KCNE1 protein can lead to long QT syndrome due to structural changes in the KvLQT1/KCNE1 complex, and people with these mutations are advised to avoid triggers of cardiac arrhythmia and prolonged QT intervals, such as stress or strenuous exercise.
While loss-of-function mutations in KCNE1 cause Long QT syndrome, gain-of-function KCNE1 mutations are associated with early-onset atrial fibrillation. A common KCNE1 polymorphism, S38G, is associated with altered predisposition to lone atrial fibrillation and postoperative atrial fibrillation. Atrial KCNE1 expression was downregulated in a porcine model of post-operative atrial fibrillation following lung lobectomy. 
Recently an analysis of 32 KCNE1 variants shows that putative/confirmed loss-of-function KCNE1 variants predispose to QT-prolongation, however the low ECG penetrance observed suggests they do not manifest clinically in the majority of individuals, aligning with the mild phenotype observed for JLNS2 patients.

Denis Coughlan

Denis Coughlan (born 7 June 1945) is an Irish former hurler, Gaelic footballer and manager who played for Cork Senior Championship clubs Glen Rovers and St. Nicholas'. As a dual player he played for the Cork senior teams for 15 years, during which time he played as a back, a midfielder and a forward. Coughlan is regarded as one of Cork's greatest-ever dual players.
Coughlan began his career at club level as a hurler with Glen Rovers and as a Gaelic footballer with St. Nicholas'. His club career spanned three decades from the 1960s until the 1980s, the highlight of which was winning All-Ireland Club Championship medals with Glen Rovers in 1973 as captain and again in 1977. Coughlan also won a combined total of four Munster Club Championship medals and seven Cork County Championship medals across both codes.
At inter-county level, Coughlan was part of the successful Cork junior football team that won the All-Ireland Championship in 1964 before later winning the All-Ireland Championship with the Cork under-21 hurling team in 1966. He joined the Cork senior football team in 1965 before linking up with the Cork senior hurling team in 1968. From his debut, Coughlan was ever-present as a midfielder or left wing-back and made a combined total of 53 Championship appearances across both codes in a career that ended with his last game for the Cork hurling team in 1980. During that time he was part of five All-Ireland Championship-winning teams – four as a hurler and one as a Gaelic footballer. Coughlan also secured a combined total of 10 Munster Championship medals and three National Hurling League medals.
Coughlan won his first All-Star in 1972, before claiming a further three All-Stars in 1976, 1977 and 1978. He was also selected as the Texaco Hurler of the Year in 1977. At inter-provincial level, Coughlan was selected to play in several championship campaigns with Munster as dual player, with Railway Cup wins in 1972 as a Gaelic football and 1978 as a hurler.
In retirement from playing Coughlan became involved in team management and coaching at club and inter-county levels in both hurling and Gaelic football. After guiding St. Catherine's to the Cork Junior Championship in 1983, he later had two unsuccessful seasons as coach of the Cork senior football team. Coughlan also enjoyed Munster Championship victories as coach of the Cork minor and under-21 hurling teams.
Playing career.
North Monastery.
During his secondary schooling at the North Monastery, Coughlan played in all grades of hurling before eventually joining the college's senior hurling team in his final years. He played in several Harty Cup campaigns but enjoyed little success.
St. Nicholas'.
On 14 November 1965, Coughlan lined out at midfield in his first final of the Cork Senior Football Championship, with St. Finbarr's providing the opposition. He ended the game with his first winners' medal after a 2–04 to 0–06 victory.
Coughlan was again selected at midfield when St. Nicholas' and St. Finbarr's clashed in a second successive final on 4 December 1966. Described in the "Cork Examiner" as "the most stylish footballer on the field", he ended the game with a second championship medal after the 1–07 to 1–06 victory. On 19 July 1967, Coughlan claimed a Munster Club Championship medal from midfield following St. Nicholas' 2–04 to 1–06 defeat of John Mitchels in the final.
On 26 October 1969, Coughlan lined in a third final with University College Cork providing the opposition. After starting at right wing-back, he was switched to right wing-forward in an effort to increase the scoring threat, however, Coughlan ended the game on the losing side after a 0–09 to 0–08 defeat.
Glen Rovers.
Coughlan was still just 18-years-old when he was added to the Glen Rovers senior hurling team in advance of the 1964 Championship. On 11 October 1964, he was a member of the extended panel when Glen Rovers claimed the championship after a 3–12 to 2–07 defeat of St. Finbarr's in the final. By the time the Munster Club Championship was completed nearly 18 months later, Coughlan had broken onto the starting fifteen. He claimed a Munster Club Championship medal on 10 April 1966 after lining out at midfield in the Glen's 3–07 to 1–07 defeat of Mount Sion in the final.
On 8 October 1967, Coughlan was selected at centre-back when Glen Rovers faced St. Finbarr's in the 1967 final. He was instrumental in bolstering the labouring Glen midfield in the second half and claimed a second winners' medal – his first on the field of play – following the 3–09 to 1–09 victory.
Coughlan was selected at midfield when Glen Rovers qualified to meet University College Cork in the 1969 final on 21 September 1969. He ended the game with a third winners' medal after the 4–16 to 1–13 victory. On 11 April 1971, Coughlan again lined out at midfield when Glen Rovers faced Roscrea in the delayed Munster Club Championship final. He ended the game on the losing side after a 3–06 to 1–09 defeat.
After an absence of three years, Glen Rovers qualified for the final once again on 12 November 1972, with Coughlan lining out at midfield. He ended the game with a third winners' medal after the 3–15 to 1–10 victory over first-time finalists Youghal. On 22 April 1973, Coughlan claimed a second Munster Club Championship medal after scoring two points from play in the 2–09 to 1–10 defeat of Roscrea in the final. On 9 December 1973, he captained Glen Rovers in the delayed All-Ireland final against St. Rynagh's and collected an All-Ireland Club Championship medal following the 2–18 to 2–08 victory.
On 14 October 1973, Coughlan captained Glen Rovers from right wing-back when they faced Blackrock in the 1973 final. He ended the game on the losing side for the first time in his career after the Glen suffered a 2–12 to 2–10 defeat.
On 14 September 1975, Coughlan lined out at centre-back when Glen Rovers played Blackrock in a second final in three years. The 4–11 to 0–10 scoreline resulted in a defeat for Glen Rovers.
Glen Rovers faced Blackrock in a third final in four years on 3 October 1976, with Coughlan being selected at left wing-back. He claimed a fourth winners' medal following the 2–07 to 0–10 victory. On 19 December 1976, Coughlan collected a third Munster Club Championship medal after scoring two points from play in the 2–08 to 2–04 defeat of South Liberties in the Munster final. On 27 March 1977, he was again selected at left wing-back when Glen Rovers faced Camross in the All-Ireland final. Coughlan collected a second All-Ireland Club Championship winners' medal after the 2–12 to 0–08 victory.
On 18 September 1977, Glen Rovers faced St. Finbarr's in front of a record crowd of 34,151 in the 1977 final. Lining out at left wing-back, Coughlan ended the game on the losing side after the Glen suffered a 1–17 to 1–05 defeat,
Glen Rovers qualified for a fourth successive final on 22 October 1978, with Blackrock providing the opposition. Coughlan once again lined out at left wing-back but lost his second successive final after a 4–12 to 1–07 defeat.
Coughlan was appointed the Glen Rovers captain for the 1980 Championship. On 12 October 1980, he led the team from left wing-back to an appearance in the final against St. Finbarr's. Coughlan ended the game on the losing side after a 1–09 to 2–04 defeat.
On 13 September 1981, Coughlan lined out in his 10th final, with reigning champions St. Finbarr's providing the opposition for a second successive year. In what was his last major game for the club, Coughlan ended on the losing side for the sixth time in his career after the 1–12 to 1–09 defeat.
Cork.
Minor and under-21.
Coughlan first played for Cork as a member of the minor football team during the 1963 Munster Championship. He made his first appearance for the team on 14 July 1963 when he was selected at left corner-back in Cork's 0-08 apiece draw with Kerry in the Munster final. Coughlan retained his position on the starting fifteen for the replay on 26 July 1963 but ended the game on the losing side after the 0–11 to 0–04 defeat.
Coughlan was just out of the minor grade when he was a late addition to the Cork under-21 football panel for the delayed 1963 Munster final against Kerry on 22 March 1964. Lining out at centre-back, he ended the game with a Munster Under-21 Championship medal following the 2–03 to 1–04 victory.
On 8 August 1965, Coughlan claimed a second Munster Under-21 Championship medal after lining out at midfield in the 2–14 to 1–06 defeat of Tipperary in the Munster final. On 3 October 1965, he was again selected at midfield when Cork faced Kildare in the All-Ireland final. Coughlan scored a point from play but ended the game on the losing side following a 2–11 to 1–07 defeat.
On 18 August 1966, Coughlan was named at centre-back when Cork faced Kerry in the Munster final. In what his last game for the Cork under-21 football team, he ended the game on the losing side after a 3–08 to 0–14 defeat. By this stage Coughlan had become a dual player when he was also selected for the Cork under-21 hurling team. He won a Munster Under-21 Championship medal in that code on 8 September 1966 when he lined out at right wing-back in a 5–12 to 2–06 defeat of Limerick in the Munster final. Coughlan retained his position on the starting fifteen for the 3–12 to 5-06 All-Ireland final draw with Wexford on 2 October 1966. He was again selected at right wing-back for the replay on 23 October 1966, however, the game once again ended in a 4-09 apiece draw. Coughlan was switched to left wing-back for the second replay on 13 November 1966 and claimed an All-Ireland Under-21 Championship medal at the third attempt following a 9–09 to 5–09 victory.
Senior.
On 20 June 1965, Coughlan had just turned 20 when he made his Munster Championship debut for the Cork senior football team. He lined out at left corner-back in a 2–06 to 0–06 defeat by Limerick in the Munster semi-final.
Coughlan was dropped from the Cork senior football team for the 1966 Munster Championship, but returned as captain of the team the following year while he was also a substitute with the Cork senior hurling team. On 16 July 1967, he won his first Munster Championship medal after captaining the team from centre-back in an 0–08 to 0–07 defeat of Kerry in the final. On 24 September 1967, Coughlan captained Cork to an All-Ireland final appearance against Meath. He ended the game on the losing side following a 1–09 to 0–9 defeat.
On 14 July 1968, Coughlan lined out at centre-back in a second successive Munster final against Kerry. He ended the game on the losing side as Cork surrendered their title following a 1–21 to 3–08 defeat by Kerry. A week later on 21 July 1968, Coughlan lined out at midfield when the Cork senior hurling team faced Tipperary in the Munster final. For the second week in succession he ended the Munster final on the losing side as the hurlers suffered a 2–13 to 1–07 defeat.
Coughlan continued with his dual player status for the 1969 season, and won a National Hurling League medal as a non-playing substitute on 4 May 1969 after a 3–12 to 1–14 defeat of Wexford in the final. Coughlan lined out in a third successive Munster final with the Cork senior football team on 20 July 1969. Playing in his customary position of centre-back, he ended the game on the losing side after the 1–14 to 0–16 defeat by Kerry. A week later on 27 July 1969, Coughlan was selected at midfield when the Cork senior hurling team faced Tipperary in a second successive Munster final. He scored two points from play and claimed his first Munster Championship medal in that code following the 4–06 to 0–09 victory. On 7 September 1969, Coughlan was again selected at midfield when Cork suffered a 2–15 to 2–09 defeat by Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final.
On 26 July 1970, Coughlan was selected at left corner-forward when Cork faced Kerry in the Munster final. He top-scored for Cork with 2-04 from play but ended the game on the losing side following the 2–22 to 2–09 defeat. After missing the Cork senior hurling team's Munster Championship campaign, Coughlan was recalled to the starting fifteen at midfield on 16 August 1970 for the 4–20 to 2-09 All-Ireland semi-final defeat of Antrim. On 6 September 1970, he was relegated to the substitutes' bench for the All-Ireland final against Wexford. Coughlan remained on the bench for the entire game but claimed an All-Ireland medal after the 6–20 to 5–10 victory in the first-ever 80-minute decider.
Coughlan committed solely to the Cork senior football team for the 1971 Munster Championship. He won a second Munster Championship medal on 18 July 1971 after scoring 0-10 after coming on as a substitute in Cork's 0–25 to 0–14 defeat of Kerry in the final.
On 7 May 1972, Coughlan won a second National Hurling League medal – his first on the field of play – after Cork's 3–14 to 2–14 defeat of Limerick in the final. On 16 July 1972, he lined out at midfield when Cork faced Kerry in the Munster final once again. He scored 1-01 from play but ended the game on the losing side as the Cork senior footballers surrendered their title after a 2–21 to 2–15 defeat. Two weeks later on 30 July 1972, Coughlan lined out at midfield when the Cork senior hurling team qualified to play Clare in the Munster final. He scored a point from play and claimed a second winners' medal following the 6–18 to 2–08 victory. After missing the All-Ireland semi-final, Coughlan was restored to the starting fifteen for the All-Ireland final against Kilkenny on 3 September 1972. Trailing by eight points with 13 minutes left to play, Kilkenny staged a remarkable comeback to win the game by 3–24 to 5–11. In spite of the defeat, Coughlan ended the season by being named at midfield on the All-Star Team "for his hard work and devotion to the game and his county and for his dexterity and elegance in his play."
Coughlan was appointed captain of the Cork senior hurling team for the 1973 Munster Championship, however, his tenure was short-lived as Cork suffered an opening-round defeat by Tipperary. As a member of the Cork senior football team also that season, he lined out at centre-forward when Cork faced Kerry in the Munster final on 15 July 1973. Coughlan was held scoreless throughout but ended the game with a third Munster Championship medal following the 5–12 to 1–15 victory. He retained his position on the starting fifteen for the All-Ireland final against Galway on 23 September 1973, however, Coughlan was switched from the half-forward line to midfield. He scored a point from play and ended the game with an All-Ireland medal as Cork claimed the title for the first time since 1945 after a 3–17 to 2–13 victory.
On 5 May 1974, Coughlan won a second National Hurling League medal after lining out at midfield in the 6–15 to 1–12 defeat of Wexford in the final. The team later made an early exit from the 1974 Munster Championship, with Coughlan's retirement from inter-county hurling and his proposed retirement from inter-county football being reported in the "Evening Echo" on 27 May 1974. The lack of hurling action allowed Coughlan to commit solely to the Cork senior football team as captain for the second time in his career. On 14 July 1974, he captained the team from midfield when Cork faced Kerry in the Munster final. Coughlan ended the game with a fourth winners' medal after the 1–11 to 0–07 victory, while he also had the honour of collecting the cup for a second time as captain.
After having no involvement at inter-county level during the respective 1975 Championships, Coughlan was recalled to the Cork senior hurling team in advance of the 1975–76 National Hurling League and was retained for the 1976 Munster Championship. On 1 August 1976, he won a third Munster Championship medal after lining out at left wing-back in Cork's 3–15 to 4–05 defeat of Limerick in the final. On 5 September 1976, Coughlan was again selected at left wing-back when Cork faced Wexford in the All-Ireland final. After being eight points down after just six minutes, Cork secured a 2–21 to 4–11 victory with Coughlan claiming his second All-Ireland medal and his first on the field of play. He ended the season by being named in the left wing-back position on the All-Star Team.
On 19 June 1977, Coughlan captained the Cork senior hurling team for the second time in his championship career due to the absence of the named captain Martin O'Doherty for the 4–13 to 3–11 defeat of Waterford. He claimed a fourth Munster Championship medal on 10 July 1977 following Cork's 4–15 to 4–10 defeat of Clare in the final. On 4 September 1977, Coughlan lined out at left wing-back when Cork qualified to play Wexford in a second successive All-Ireland final. He ended the game with a third winners' medal after the 1–17 to 3–08 victory. Coughlan ended the season by once again being named on the All-Star Team while he was also selected as the Texaco Hurler of the Year.
Coughlan lined out at left wing-back in a third successive Munster final on 30 July 1978. He ended the game with a fifth winners' medal after the 0–13 to 0–11 defeat of Clare for the second year in-a-row. On 3 September 1978, Coughlan was selected at left wing-back for his third successive All-Ireland final appearance. He ended the game on the winning side after the 1–15 to 2–08 defeat of Kilkenny and claimed a third successive winners' medal. Coughlan was once again named at left wing-back on the All-Star Team.
On 8 July 1979, Coughlan lined out at left wing-back in his sixth Munster final appearance. He preserved his 100% record of victories and claimed a sixth winners' medal after the 2–14 to 0–09 victory over Limerick.
While a number of his teammates retired, Coughlan, who was approaching 35, once again committed to Cork for the 1979–80 season. On 4 May 1980, he was at right wing-back when Cork drew 2-10 apiece with Limerick in the National League final. Coughlan retained his position on the starting fifteen for the replay two weeks later and claimed a third National Hurling League medal after the 4–15 to 4–06 victory. On 20 July 1980, Coughlan was again selected at right wing-back when Cork and Limerick renewed their rivalry in the Munster final. In what was his last game for Cork, he ended on the losing side after the 2–14 to 2–10 defeat.
Munster.
Coughlan was first selected for the Munster inter-provincial football team in advance of the 1968 Railway Cup. He made his first appearance for the team on 25 February 1968 when he lined out at centre-back in the 0–11 to 0–05 defeat by Leinster.
After a four-year absence, Coughlan was recalled to the Munster football team for the 1972 Railway Cup. On 17 March 1972, he lined out at centre-forward for the 1-15 apiece draw with Leinster in the final. Coughlan retained his position on the starting fifteen for the replay on 23 April 1972 and ended the game with a winners' medal after the 2–14 to 0–10 victory.
Coughlan became a dual player at inter-provincial level when he was also added to the Munster hurling team for the 1973 Railway Cup. After making his first appearance for the team in the semi-final defeat of Connacht, he was at midfield on 17 March 1973 when Munster suffered a 1–13 to 2–08 defeat by Leinster in the final.
On 17 March 1977, Coughlan was selected at left wing-back when Munster qualified to play Leinster in the Railway Cup final. He ended the game on the losing side after a 2–17 to 1–13 defeat.
Coughlan was again included on the Munster hurling selection for the 1978 Railway Cup. He was selected in his customary position of left wing-back when Munster qualified to play Leinster in the final on 7 May 1978 at Páirc Uí Chaoimh. Coughlan ended the game with a second Railway Cup medal – his first as a member of the hurling team.
Coughlan earned his fourth call-up to the Munster hurling team in advance of the 1979 Railway Cup. He played his last game for the province on 11 March 1979 when Munster suffered a 4–09 to 2–07 defeat by Connacht at the semi-final stage.
Management career.
St. Catherine's.
Coughlan first became involved in club management when he was appointed trainer of the St. Catherine's junior hurling team at the start of the 1983 season. On 28 August 1983, he saw the team capture the East Cork Championship after a 4–14 to 3–07 defeat of Midleton in the final. On 6 November 1983, St. Catherine's qualified for the final of the Cork Junior Championship where they faced Aghabullogue. Coughlan's side secured the title after a 1–13 to 1–09 victory.
Cork.
On 16 October 1984, Coughlan was elected to the position of selector with the Cork senior football team before later assuming the position of coach. Cork's National Football League campaign ended with the team finishing bottom of Division 1 and being relegated to Division 2 for the following season. On 1 May 1985, Coughlan's side suffered a 2–11 to 0–04 defeat by Kerry in the final of the 1985 Ford Open Draw Cup. Both sides renewed their rivalry in the Munster final on 21 July 1985, with Cork losing out by 2–11 to 0–11.
On 6 July 1986, Coughlan coached Cork to a second successive Munster final appearance against Kerry. Cork were once again defeated on a 0–12 to 0–08 scoreline. Coughlan stepped aside as coach shortly after this defeat.
Glen Rovers.
In October 1986, Coughlan was appointed coach of the Glen Rovers senior hurling team. His one season in charge saw Glen Rovers reach the semi-finals of the 1987 Championship where they suffered a 0–12 to 0–08 defeat by Na Piarsaigh.
Cork.
On 11 July 1989, Coughlan was ratified as coach of the Cork minor hurling team. On 15 July 1990, he guided the team to the Munster Championship title after a 1–09 to 0–09 defeat of Clare in the final. On 2 September 1990, Cork drew 3-14 apiece with Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final. The replay four weeks later saw Coughlan's side suffer a 3–16 to 0–11 defeat.
Coughlan took over as manager of the Cork under-21 hurling team in advance of the 1991 Munster Championship. On 7 August 1991, he guided Cork to the Munster Championship title after a 0–17 to 1–07 defeat of Limerick in the final.

Neal Lancaster

Grady Neal Lancaster (born September 13, 1962) is an American professional golfer who has played on the PGA Tour, Nationwide Tour and the PGA Tour Champions.
Lancaster was born, raised and makes his home in Smithfield, North Carolina. He turned pro in 1985 as a completely self-taught player. Lancaster started playing on mini-tours four months in 1989, winning twice on the U.S. Golf Tour, before going to Q School. He did not take his first golf lesson until 1992. His first golf lesson was given by L.B. Floyd, father of Raymond Floyd.
Lancaster has 28 top-10 finishes in 579 PGA Tour events, including a win at the 1994 GTE Byron Nelson Golf Classic, which was shortened to 36 holes due to weather. (Prior to 1996, PGA Tour events shortened to 36 holes were considered official.) His best finish in a major is a T-4 at the 1995 U.S. Open.
Lancaster set the 9-hole record at the U.S. Open with 29 strokes at the 1995 (4th round) and 1996 U.S. Opens (second round). This has been tied by Vijay Singh (2003, second round), Louis Oosthuizen (2015, fourth round), and Tom Kim (2023, third round).
In 2002, Lancaster came to the final hole of the Bell Canadian Open with a two-shot lead. He made double bogey to drop into a sudden death playoff with John Rollins and Justin Leonard. Rollins won on the first extra hole. Lancaster played full-time on the PGA Tour from 1990 to 2005.
Lancaster placed fifth at the 2009 Q School tournament, but shoulder surgeries plagued him for years. He played in the 2012 Farmers Insurance Open, his first PGA Tour start since 2009. He made the cut at the FedEx St. Jude Classic, his first since the 2009 Buick Open.
After turning 50, Lancaster played his first Champions Tour event in October 2012 at the SAS Championship and finished T8 at the tour's Q school. After ending his career as a touring professional, Lancaster became a PGA professional, competing in events sanctioned through the Carolinas section of the PGA. In 2017, Lancaster won Carolinas PGA Senior Professional Championship.

Ladies' Gaelic Football Association

The Ladies' Gaelic Football Association () is the main governing body for ladies' Gaelic football. It organises competitions such as the All-Ireland Senior Ladies' Football Championship and the Ladies' National Football League.
Foundation.
The Ladies' Gaelic Football Association was founded on 18 July 1974 at a meeting held at the Hayes' Hotel in Thurles, County Tipperary, almost ninety years after the Gaelic Athletic Association was founded at the same hotel. Representatives from four counties – Offaly, Kerry, Tipperary and Galway – attended the meeting. In the same year the LGFA also organised the inaugural All-Ireland Senior Ladies' Football Championship. The LGFA was recognised by the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1982.

Al-Baqara 256

The verse (ayah) 256 of Al-Baqara is a famous verse in the Islamic scripture, the Quran. The verse includes the phrase that "there is no compulsion in religion". Immediately after making this statement, the Quran offers a rationale for it: Since the revelation has, through explanation, clarification, and repetition, clearly distinguished the path of guidance from the path of misguidance, it is now up to people to choose the one or the other path. This verse comes right after the Throne Verse.
The overwhelming majority of Muslim scholars consider that verse to be a Medinan one, when Muslims lived in their period of political ascendance, and to be non abrogated, including Ibn Taymiyya, Ibn Qayyim, Al-Tabari, Abi ʿUbayd, Al-Jaṣṣās, Makki bin Abi Talib, Al-Nahhas, Ibn Jizziy, Al-Suyuti, Ibn Ashur, Mustafa Zayd, and many others. According to all the theories of language elaborated by Muslim legal scholars, the Quranic proclamation that 'There is no compulsion in religion. The right path has been distinguished from error' is as absolute and universal a statement as one finds, and so under no condition should an individual be forced to accept a religion or belief against his or her will according to the Quran.
The meaning of the principle that there is no compulsion in religion was not limited to freedom of individuals to choose their own religion. Islam also provided non-Muslims with considerable economic, cultural, and administrative rights.
Text and meaning.
Text and transliteration.
 
 
Translation.
Let there be no compulsion in religion, for the truth stands out clearly from falsehood. So whoever renounces false gods and believes in God has certainly grasped the firmest, unfailing hand-hold. And God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things.
There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And is Hearing and Knowing.
Context.
According to some commentators, this verse (Quran 2:256) was directed towards a small group of residents of Medina and is related to an incident during the time of the Prophet. The incident involved a Muslim boy who had been educated in a Jewish school in Medina and decided to depart with a Jewish tribe that was being expelled from the city. When the boy's distraught parents asked the Prophet if they could compel their son to stay, he told them that there is no compulsion in religion, as stated in the verse.
 It is reported that Mujahid said that "This verse was revealed about a man of the Helpers who had a black boy called Subayh whom he used to coerce to become Muslim".
In all cases, following the famous maxim ("Consideration is granted to the Generality of the Language, not to the Specificity of the Reason [for Revelation]") it is concluded that the verse is general in meaning, and thus the verse has been understood over the centuries as a general command that people cannot be forced to convert to Islam.
Discussion.
Relevance to apostasy.
First, the "no compulsion" phrase should not be used out of context and all exegesis of Quran that is "linear-atomistic" analysis of one small phrase in one verse is flawed. The complete verse and nearby verses should be read to understand the "complex hermeneutic totality" of context for anything in Quran.
It is reported that Mujahid said that "This verse was revealed about a man of the Helpers [Ansar of Medina] who had a black boy called Subayh whom he used to coerce to become Muslim". In addition scholar argue, no single phrase or verse in Quran is less or more relevant in Islam than other phrases or verses in Quran; and other verses in Quran such as verse 66 of At-Tawba state "Make no excuses! You have lost faith after your belief. If We pardon a group of you, We will punish others for their wickedness.", As well as "And say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹This is˺ the truth from your Lord. Whoever wills let them believe, and whoever wills let them disbelieve.” ...", "Had your Lord so willed ˹O Prophet˺, all ˹people˺ on earth would have certainly believed, every single one of them! Would you then force people to become believers?", "So, ˹continue to˺ remind ˹all, O Prophet˺, for your duty is only to remind. You are not ˹there˺ to compel them ˹to believe˺", "He said, “O my people! Consider if I stand on a clear proof from my Lord and He has blessed me with a mercy from Himself,1 which you fail to see. Should we ˹then˺ force it on you against your will?". According to some western scholars, in the history of Islamic exegesis scholarship, that verse is considered as an early revelation, and abrogated by verses that were revealed to Muhammad at a later stage in his life. However, as stated by the famous British orientalist Sir Thomas Walker Arnold the verse in question is a Medinan verse, when Muslims lived in their period of political ascendance. Moreover, Muslim scholars have established the abrogated verses and Q.2:256 isn't among them. Finally, to understand the Quran, the sayings and actions of Muhammad as recorded in Hadith collections are considered by Islamic scholars.
Ibn Kathir's interpretation.
The Quran commentator ("Muffasir") Ibn Kathir, a Sunni, suggests that the verse implies that Muslims should not force anyone to convert to Islam since the truth of Islam is so self-evident that no one is in need of being coerced into it,
Kashani's interpretation.
Kashani, a Sufi, interprets Q.2:256 as follows 
Verses relating to Quran 2:256.
A number of verses relate to Quran 2:256 and this includes,
These verses indicate that compulsion is strictly prohibited.

Memory type range register

Memory type range registers (MTRRs) are a set of processor supplementary capability control registers that provide system software with control of how accesses to memory ranges by the CPU are cached. It uses a set of programmable model-specific registers (MSRs) which are special registers provided by most modern CPUs. Possible access modes to memory ranges can be uncached, write-through, write-combining, write-protect, and write-back. In write-back mode, writes are written to the CPU's cache and the cache is marked dirty, so that its contents are written to memory later.
Write-combining allows bus write transfers to be combined into a larger transfer before bursting them over the bus to allow more efficient writes to system resources like graphics card memory. This often increases the speed of image write operations by several times, at the cost of losing the simple sequential read/write semantics of normal memory. Additional bits which are provided on some computer architectures, such as AMD64, allow the shadowing of ROM contents in memory (shadow ROM), and the configuration of memory-mapped I/O.
MTRRs in x86-PC processors.
In early x86 architecture systems, especially where the cache was provided by separate chips outside of the CPU package, this function was controlled by the chipset and configured through BIOS settings.
When the CPU cache was moved inside the CPU, the CPUs implemented "fixed-range MTRRs" which cover the first megabyte of memory to be compatible to what PC-BIOSes provided at that time. These are used to control the cache policy needed for VGA accesses and all other memory-accesses done while the system is in real mode. Above 1 MB, CPUs provide a number of "variable-range MTRRs", which can be freely placed and even overlap. These variable-range MTRRs can be used to set the caching policy of graphics memory and other memory ranges used by PCI devices.
The MTRR count varies:
The memory interface of AMD K8 CPUs supports "Extended fixed-range MTRR Type-Field Encodings" which allows one to specify whether accesses to certain address ranges are executed by accessing RAM through the Direct Connect Architecture or by executing memory-mapped I/O. This allows, for example, shadow RAM to be implemented by copying ROM contents into RAM.
Successor.
Newer x86 CPUs support a more advanced technique called page attribute tables (PATs) that allow for per-page setting of these modes, instead of having a limited number of low-granularity registers to deal with modern memory sizes that can be as high as 64 GB even on a laptop, and several times that amount on a desktop system.

Address-range registers (ARR) are control registers of the Cyrix 6x86, 6x86MX and MII processors that are used as a control mechanism which provides system software with control of how accesses to memory ranges by the CPU are cached, similar to what memory type range registers (MTRRs) provide on other implementations of the x86 architecture.

Ärsenik

Ärsenik is a rap group based in Villiers-le-Bel, France, founded in 1992, and made up of two brothers, Lino (Gaëlino M'Bani) and Calbo (Calboni M'Bani), whose family is originally from Congo.
Career.
Ärsenik started as a band in mid 1990s. Until 1997, the group also included Tony Truand, a cousin. In 1998, now a duo, Ärsenik released their first album "Quelques gouttes suffisent" went double gold. A new album was planned for 2005, but the two brothers instead decided to concentrate on solo albums. Lino released "Paradis Assassiné" en 2005, which was the name of a solo song on the group's second album.
In 2007 the group released a disc titled "S'il en reste quelque chose" which included the most popular songs from the two brothers, such as "L'enfer remonte à la surface", "Rime &amp; chatiments" and "Sexe, pouvoir &amp; biftons".
Revered as one of the original rap groups, their music voices the disaffection of the French underclass, combining African and Arabic melodies and beats with French lyrics. French rap is filled with slang that is hard for even French-speakers to understand; whole songs are delivered in Verlan, the ingenious, dizzying slang in which words are reversed or recombined. Like France's chanson tradition, French rap is also famous for emphasizing lyrics, and the rappers are widely viewed as heirs to the chansonniers.
In the late 1990s, Lino and Calbo teamed up with a group of rappers who were also second-generation Africans, on a collaborative project called Bisso Na Bisso, an expression which means "just between ourselves" in Lingala, the most commonly spoken language in the Congo region. Part of this group were Ben-J (from Les Neg'Marrons), Passi (from Ministère A.M.E.R.), twin brothers Doc and G Kill (from 2Bal), and Mystik and his female cousin M'Passi. The group embarked on a collective return to their African roots, featuring music with an innovative fusion of styles, that mixed modern hip-hop and zouk sounds with traditional Congolese rumba.
Members and solo/other projects.
The members of Ärsenik have engaged in various personal projects besides the band. Rapper Lino has released two solo albums of his own, "Paradis assassiné" released in September 2005 and "Radio Bitume" released in May 2012. Both have charted in France and particularly "Paradis assassiné" released on Hostile Records was a great commercial success. The title is a title of an Ärsenik album. 
In 2004, he collaborated in a music project by Kery James in the single "Relève la tête" credited to "Kery James presents Lino, AP, Diam's, Passi, Matt &amp; Kool Shen". In 2007, he also collaborated with three tracks on rapper Stomy Bugsy album "Rimes Passionnelles" and in 2009, took part in Bisso Na Bisso's project "Africa". In 2012 he signed with AZ, now part of Universal Music.
Rapper Calbo continued with a solo music career. In 2003, he charted in a hit "Trop de peine" by Lynnsha featuring Calbo vocals. In 2012, he released his solo album titled "6ème Chaudron" and in June 2013, he released his solo single "C'est là-bas" on Trèfle record label accompanied by a music video. It featured another fellow Congolese artist known as VR.

Bubbles (The Wire)

Reginald "Bubbles" Cousins is a fictional character on the HBO drama "The Wire", played by actor Andre Royo. Bubbles is a recovering heroin addict. His real name is not revealed until a fourth-season episode when he is called "Mr. Cousins" and in the fifth-season premiere when he is called "Reginald". Bubbles has a son named KeyShawn, who lives with his mother. He is nicknamed "Bubbles" because when he is in a heroin-induced stupor, he tends to make bubbles with his spit.
Bubbles is a crucial police informant throughout the series due to his extraordinarily detailed knowledge of the streets of Baltimore and their inhabitants. Bubbles is an intelligent and compassionate man who genuinely cares about his friend Johnny Weeks and Sherrod, the teenager he informally adopts. Bubbles's struggle to deal with his addiction and make a better life for himself is a major sub-plot over the course of the series.
Depiction.
Season one.
Bubbles is first seen as a homeless addict and best friend and mentor to Johnny Weeks. The two run a scam creating counterfeit money using a photocopier and coffee staining. Bubbles successfully uses the money to purchase drugs from a crew of dealers working for the Barksdale organization. However, when the money is passed on to D'Angelo Barksdale, it is recognized as fake. The next time they try the scam, a nervous Johnny is unsuccessful. He is stopped and severely beaten by the Barksdale drug dealers, who put him in the hospital.
Bubbles offers to inform on the Barksdale gang for Kima Greggs, to get some measure of revenge for Johnny's beating. Bubbles' knowledge of the street proves invaluable to Cedric Daniels' unit as they investigate the Barksdale organization. He helps identify the crew members who run the Barksdale pit and those who work in the high-rise towers. When Omar Little robs the Barksdale stash, Bubbles is present, and gives the license plate number of Omar's van to Greggs, which helps the detail track down the stick-up man.
After nearly being killed while trying to steal drugs, he tries to get off drugs, but reverts to his old habits when Kima gets shot: he pages Kima after she had promised to help him stay clean, not realizing that she is hospitalized with a life-threatening injury after a botched sting. As the police seek murder suspects, Bubbles is mistaken as a suspect and brutally beaten in custody by Vernon Holley until Jay Landsman and other officers restrain Holley, calling in Jimmy McNulty to clear things up.
Season two.
McNulty recruits Bubbles to track down Omar when he's needed to testify as a witness in the William Gant murder. Bubbles grudgingly agrees, and in a nervous encounter with a shotgun-wielding Omar, delivers McNulty's message. At the end of season two, he is arrested by Michael Santangelo while trying to steal needles and morphine from an ambulance; in exchange for his release, he tips off Greggs and McNulty to the new alliance between Proposition Joe and Stringer Bell.
Season three.
Bubbles is back to assisting the Major Crimes Unit once again. Bubbles is a former associate of Squeak, the girlfriend of Bernard, the runner assigned by the Barksdale gang to pick up their burner phones. Bubbles puts them in touch with an undercover Lester Freamon, allowing the unit to sell pre-tapped burner phones directly to the gang. During this time Bubbles' continued cooperation with the police starts to create a rift between Bubbles and Johnny, who encourages Bubbles to end his career as an informant. Eventually Bubbles leaves Johnny to fend for himself.
As the investigation progresses Bubbles begins to supplement the income he is earning as an informant by collecting discarded cell phones and T-shirts to sell out of a shopping cart; upon discovering Major Howard "Bunny" Colvin's "Hamsterdam" zones he expands his inventory to suit the needs of the dealers and addicts there. While in Hamsterdam, Bubbles also comes back into contact with Johnny and, upon recognizing that his friend's health was failing due to drug abuse, encourages him to leave – his fears are realized at the end of the season, when Johnny dies from an overdose.
Season four.
Bubbles shares an abandoned garage with a teenager named Sherrod, peddling small goods from a shopping cart to support themselves. Sherrod has trouble with the arithmetic involved. Bubbles fails in his attempts to encourage the boy to return to school. After a brief fall-out, Sherrod returns to Bubbles. In Sherrod's absence, however, Bubbles has become the daily victim of another street addict who constantly robs him and beats him up. To stop this daily assault, Bubbles concocts a "hot shot" of heroin and sodium cyanide that he supposes the vagrant will steal from him and then consume.
However, Sherrod uses the tainted drugs while Bubbles sleeps and Bubbles awakes to find that Sherrod has died. Consumed by guilt and grief, Bubbles goes to the police and confesses his actions, before unsuccessfully attempting suicide in the Homicide interrogation room. Jay Landsman sees that the death was unintentional, and in an attempt to reduce the murder count in the city, has him sent to a state psychiatric facility rather than charge him with murder.
Season five.
When the fifth season begins Bubbles has been clean for more than a year. He is living in his sister's basement with strict rules not to come upstairs or stay in the house unattended. Bubbles spends his days selling copies of "The Baltimore Sun" to make money. His Narcotics Anonymous sponsor is Walon. Walon encourages Bubbles to open up about Sherrod's death in meetings but Bubbles is not ready to take that step. Walon suggests that Bubbles should find an outlet elsewhere and Bubbles begins volunteering at a local Catholic Worker soup kitchen called Viva House.
Eventually Bubbles comes to terms with his role in Sherrod's death and has his life story published in an article in the "Baltimore Sun". In his final scene of the series, he is seen being brought back into his sister's life when she allows him upstairs from the basement to have dinner with her and her child.
Origin.
Bubbles was based on a real police informant known as "Possum", whose true identity has not been made public at the request of his family. Possum was noted as having an incredible memory for faces, and was often very helpful in pointing out drug dealers to police. David Simon met with him twice, shortly before Possum's death from AIDS, intending to write an article about him. He ended up turning it into an obituary.
Trivia.
While filming, Royo was once approached by a Baltimore resident, who handed him a package of heroin and said he looked like he needed a fix. Royo calls this his "street Oscar."

A Twisted Christmas

A Twisted Christmas is the sixth and final studio album by American heavy metal band Twisted Sister, released on October 17, 2006. The album features classic Christmas songs, performed as heavy metal and glam metal versions, often featuring lyrical changes.
The holiday carol "Oh Come All Ye Faithful", which heavily inspired the band's popular song "We're Not Gonna Take It", is recorded in a style exactly like the Twisted Sister hit. The group's take on the carol has become one of their best-known songs since their 1980s heyday, with Twisted Sister creating a comedic music video involving the band members crashing a holiday celebration in a bickering couple's home.
Premise and inspiration.
Although not properly a concept album, the album begins with a version of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" done in the style of traditional pop music that's interrupted by a bit of banter by the group's members. Things then segue into the band's standard heavy metal style, though incorporating festive elements such as the tolling sounds of bells. Track "Heavy Metal Christmas (The Twelve Days of Christmas)", including a section known as "We Wish You a Twisted Christmas", closes out the album in a burst of clapping and cheers.
"Oh Come All Ye Faithful" closely follows what the band did with their hit "We're Not Gonna Take It". Significant elements of their popular song took inspiration from the carol. The song was performed on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" on December 13, 2006.
Parts of the guitar riff to "White Christmas" seem to be based on "I Wanna Rock", another Twisted Sister song, while its ending sounds similar to that of "S.M.F.", both were other Twisted Sister songs which also appeared on their 1984 "Stay Hungry" album. Parts of the guitar riff on "Silver Bells" is based on "Problem Child" by AC/DC. Some of the guitar riffs on "Let It Snow" are based on Black Sabbath's "Children of the Grave," although the intro sounds rather similar to "" which was a song the band had during their club days. Some of the guitar riffs from "Deck the Halls" are based on "The Boys Are Back in Town" by Thin Lizzy. Also, the guitar riffs on the song "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" are based on "You've Got Another Thing Comin'" by Judas Priest.
Metal star Ozzy Osbourne's influence on the group and its music is name-checked in closing number "Heavy Metal Christmas (The Twelve Days of Christmas)": with the promised gifts being "twelve silver crosses, eleven black mascaras, ten pairs of platforms, nine tattered t-shirts, eight pentagrams, seven leather jackets, six cans of hairspray, five skull-head rings, four quarts of Jack, three studded belts, two pairs of spandex pants, and a tattoo of Ozzy".
Recording and release.
The album was recorded from June to August 2006. The band produced the release themselves.
Two music videos were made for "Oh Come All Ye Faithful". The first one follows the same style of the band's landmark videos "We're Not Gonna Take It" and "I Wanna Rock", as a married couple celebrate Christmas when the wife discovers that her husband's gift to her is a CD copy of "A Twisted Christmas". She then starts to rant about the present until Snider and the band appear behind her. Her lines then are a nod to the video of "We're Not Gonna Take It" where a father scolds his son with the exact same words.
The second video version used the radio edit of the track. It is a short, animated feature with the band taking over Santa's workshop and using his sleigh to drop off Twisted Sister merchandise and cans of hairspray to children.
The music video for "Silver Bells" is the sequel to the first "Oh Come All Ye Faithful" video, as the couple are paid a visit by numerous guests while the band performs live on television. The couple's new baby's head is replaced by the faces of various band members singing.
Twisted Sister also filmed a studio performance of "Heavy Metal Christmas" for GameTap. Unusually, this video featured frontman Snider without his makeup.
The album has been reissued by Rhino Entertainment to streaming services in 2020, due to the Razor &amp; Tie label shuttered back in 2018.
The bonus track version have White Christmas featuring Doro Pesch instead of not.
Reception.
Music critic James C. Monger praised the release for the publication AllMusic. Monger remarked that the band's members "filter the beloved Christmas carol" tradition "through the same makeup-smeared sieve" that brought them earlier success. Arguing that Christmas albums "need to either be pretty good, horrifically terrible, or completely original to cause even the jolliest head to turn", he wrote that "Twisted Christmas" "manages to achieve all three" and constitutes a "collection of yuletide classics".

Door Door

 is a single-screen puzzle-platform game by Enix published in Japan in 1983. Originally released for the NEC PC-8801, it was ported to other platforms, including the Family Computer. Controlling a small character named Chun, the player is tasked with completing each stage by trapping different kinds of aliens behind sliding doors. Chun can jump over the aliens and climb ladders, and must also avoid obstacles such as large nails and bombs.
"Door Door" was designed and programmed by Koichi Nakamura, known as one of the creators of "Dragon Quest". The game was the runner-up in the Enix-sponsored "First Game and Hobby Program Contest" in 1982, winning the Outstanding Program Award with a prize of 500,000 yen. Enix was given the rights to the game and ported it to several Japanese home computers. Chun, the name of the protagonist, was a nickname given to Nakamura by one of his friends. "Door Door" was a critical and commercial success — the PC-8801 version alone had sold 200,000 copies, and is considered a classic title for the Famicom.
Gameplay.
Players control Chun, a small, egg-shaped creature outfitted with a baseball cap. Chun is relentlessly pursued by a quartet of aliens traveling in deterministic algorithm paths. The most predictable aliens Namegon and Amechan follow Chun in the most direct path possible, Invekun deviates and follows roundabout paths using ladders, and Otapyon shadows Chun's jumps.
The player's objective is to trap the aliens behind sliding doors positioned throughout each level, courses composed of platforms conjoined by assorted ladders. To trap the aliens, players approach the door from the side its handle is on, open it by running across it, lure the advancing villains inside, and shut the door before they escape. Trapped doors cannot be opened again. Chun can jump to avoid the aliens, who can kill him on touch. Bombs and nails, which sometimes appear on the screen, are also lethal. When the player dies (provided they have continues) they restart the level with previously trapped aliens vanished, and all doors are accessible again.
The status bar running along the top of the playing screen gives the player's score, the high score, the level number, and the number of lives remaining. Points are awarded for trapping aliens behind doors (with extra points going to players who corral multiple aliens behind one door) and collecting confectionery that intermittently appear and disappear on the playing screen, which include a striped piece of candy, an ice pop, a lollipop, a bowl of ice cream, a slice of cake, and a Mahjong tile. Players begin with three lives. Scoring 10,000 points awards the player an extra life; scoring intervals of 20,000 points thereafter awards the player more lives. If the player loses all lives, the game is over, forcing the player to restart from the first level.
As players advance, the levels become more complicated, many requiring abstract strategies. The eighth level pits Chun against a lone Otapyon alien; the player's strategy requires purposely allowing the Otapyon to shadow his jumps with the intention of guiding the unsuspecting Otapyon across the level's myriad platforms and into the doorway.
If an alien remains with all doors closed, the player is placed in a no-win situation. The tenth level, a flat expanse with two Namegon aliens and one door, illustrates this dilemma. Because the level begins with them spaced far apart, it is initially impossible to guide both aliens in the single door without one escaping. Allowing one to escape, however, places it closer to its counterpart, in turn enabling the player to trap both. If the player traps only one, then they must sacrifice one life as the stage will be impossible to complete.
The 50th level requires such timing that failure at any part guarantees an impossible-to-win scenario. As in the previous case, the player's only option is to intentionally lose a life to continue play. This is not a programming error, but another aspect of the game's difficulty level. This is a unique trait of "Door Door" as most games prevent such a scenario with a time limit (such as "Super Mario Bros.") or physical restriction (such as "Tetris"). There is no ending in "Door Door"; after completing the final level, the game simply restarts at the first level, although the player's accumulated score is retained for the player to build higher through continued play.
Development and history.
Inspired by the popularity of personal computers in the United States, Yasuhiro Fukushima decided to set up Enix, going into the PC game business market, in 1982. Fukushima wasn't a programmer himself, and Enix, in a broad sense, was simply intended to be a publishing company. To pool the talent of individual game designers, Enix sponsored a national programming contest. Three hundred programs were entered into the contest, and the first prize went to programming prodigy and high school student Koichi Nakamura for his puzzle game, "Door Door". Yuji Horii placed in the finals of the same contest with a computer tennis game; both were subsequently hired by Enix and the rights to "Door Door" became property of Enix. Enix published the game on a wide range of Japanese computers, including NEC's PC-8801, Fujitsu's FM-7, and Sharp's MZ-2000. With sales exceeding 200,000 copies, "Door Door" was a huge success. The popularity of the budding console market prompted a 1985 release on Nintendo's Famicom. In 1986, Enix's third Famicom production and first role-playing video game made Horii and Nakamura household names in Japan: "Dragon Quest".
Enix's unique approach as a game company—contracting talent for game development, then publishing the games—started a new trend in the video game industry. Like publishing companies and writers, Enix established the concept of royalties between them and their contractors. In 1984, Nakamura created a relatively exclusive contracting company, christened Chunsoft in honor of "Door Door" diminutive hero.
Ports and expanded editions.
An expanded version of the game, branded "Door Door mkII", was released two years after the original in February 1985. The game was ported to MSX computers, NEC's PC-6001, PC-6001mkII, PC-6601, PC-8801mkIISR, Sharp's Mz-1500 and Fujitsu's FM-7. It features 100 levels and the option to start the game from the new set of levels (beginning with level 51). Encouraged by the rapidly increasing popularity of video game consoles in Japan, Enix also ported "Door Door" to Nintendo's Famicom. In March 2004, Chunsoft celebrated their 20th anniversary by releasing a version of "Door Door" for Japanese mobile phone networks. A faithful reproduction of the Famicom version, the application is available for the NTT DoCoMo FOMA 505i and 900i series phones, and can be downloaded from i-chunsoft for ¥300 per month. To the right is a table of all licensed ports of "Door Door". A modified version featuring Mean Clean (エコ吉, "eco kichi" in Japanese) as the main protagonist is also featured in the 2008 visual novel "" as an unlockable bonus.

"Disambiguation: a "mutchkin" can also refer a close-fitting Scottish cap".
The mutchkin () was a Scottish unit of liquid volume measurement that was in use from at least 1661 (and possibly as early as the 15th century) until the late 19th century, approximately equivalent to 424 mL, or roughly imperial pint. The word was derived from – a mid 15th-century Dutch measure of beer or wine.

Baltringen

Baltringen is a once autonomous village in Baden-Württemberg in the region of Upper Swabia, situated approximately 17 km north of Biberach. Administratively, Baltringen is part of the municipality of Mietingen. Baltringen lies on the river Dürnach.
History.
The area in which the village of Baltringen is now situated, was settled by Alemans in the 3rd century CE, being part of the Agri Decumates. It is located on an important road, connecting Ulm with Lake Constance. This road was partly restored in the early 7th century and new settlements were founded in order to safeguard travelling. The road lead from Meersburg via Ravensburg to Birkendorf, continuing via Baltringen in the direction of Laupheim and then on towards Ulm. This road would have crossed the river Dürnach on the southern entrance of the village by using the existing sandstone bridge.
The first appearance of Baltringen in written sources dates from 1274, when two brothers, Ulrich and Berthold of Baltringen, are mentioned. It is, however, impossible to ascertain a to whether these brothers were of the nobility or not. There is evidence of high court activity in Baltringen; on old maps a place called "Galgenberg" (gallow's hill) can be found on the road towards Äpfingen.
In 1370, a subsidiary church of the parish church in Laupheim is mentioned as being in Baltringen. During the 14th century, the Herren von Freyberg of Achstetten were the rulers of Baltringen, also owing the right to inflict low justice. During the 15th century, Baltringen changed hands frequently. A great number of owners were burghers of Ulm and Biberach. Little by little the "Spital" (a hospital foundation) in Biberach bought more and more of Baltringen, so that in 1473 almost all of the village was in its possession.
During the German Peasants' War 1524-1525, Baltringen was a centre of the rebellion. The regional peasants' army was named after the village, Baltringer Haufen. The revolt failed when troops of the Swabian League beat the Baltringer Haufen in a battle fought on nearby "Baltringer Ried" (Baltringen Bog). Only in the first half of the 19th century, the last remnants of servitude were abolished.
In 1636, during the Thirty Years' War, the population of Baltringen was almost completely wiped out by bubonic plague.
In the course of the mediatisation in 1803, the main part of the village came into the possession of the Counts of Plettenberg und Bassenheim. In 1806, Baltringen became part of the Kingdom of Württemberg.
Until 1938, Baltringen was part of the district of Laupheim; since then it has been part of the district of Biberach.

Elton John AIDS Foundation

The Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF) is a nonprofit organization, established by musician Sir Elton John in 1992 in the United States and 1993 in the United Kingdom to support innovative HIV prevention, education programs, direct care and support services to people living with or at risk of HIV. It has raised over $565 million to support HIV-related programs across ninety countries.
The Elton John AIDS Foundation is in the top 10 philanthropic funders of HIV/AIDS grants worldwide, the second largest HIV-related philanthropic funder of LGBTQ+ communities, and number one philanthropic funder in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
The organization supports its work through proceeds from special events, cause-related marketing projects, and voluntary contributions from individuals, corporations and foundations.
The organization has been well-known in Hollywood since 1993, when it began hosting the annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party.
EJAF is chaired by David Furnish, a producer of theater and music. He has been in a relationship with Elton John since 1993; they entered a civil partnership in 2005 and married in 2014.
Origin.
John was inspired to start the organization after losing two friends to AIDS in the span of a year. One was Ryan White, a young man who was infected with HIV by a blood transfusion and who died in 1990. White's personable and compassionate persona helped to reduce stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with HIV, an effort that EJAF continues. John also lost his friend Freddie Mercury, a fellow musician best known as the lead singer of the rock band Queen, who died of AIDS-related bronchial pneumonia in 1991. John paid tribute to both of them in concert––he performed at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness in 1992 and dedicated his song "Skyline Pigeon" to Ryan White at his funeral.
Programs funded by EJAF.
The Elton John AIDS Foundation funds programs across all aspects of the disease, including prevention, testing, treatment, palliative care, education and global health initiatives. However, part of EJAF's strategy to effectively support people affected by HIV is to fund a broader scope of projects; their grants are not exclusively held by initiatives that are specifically HIV-focused. They also fund programs dedicated to supporting specific HIV risk groups or under-attended regions with high prevalences of HIV. This strategy has been praised and shared as a model for non-profits dedicated to similar epidemics.
Initiatives funded by EJAF include:
Events.
Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party.
Every year, the foundation throws a viewing party for the Academy Awards. It is an invitation-only event that has grown to become one of the most desired invitations in the entertainment industry, as well as one of EJAF's most fruitful fundraising efforts. The tradition has been going since the foundation was created in 1992. For the first few years, the party was a dinner held at the Maple Drive restaurant in Beverly Hills. The inaugural dinner was arranged by Patrick Lippet, another activist in Hollywood who was best known for his work with the Rock the Vote campaign. Lippet died from AIDS only three months after helping Elton John put together the first EJAF Oscar night party.
In 1998, the party moved to Spago, another upscale restaurant in Beverly Hills known for its celebrity clientele. It has moved multiple times since then with the West Hollywood Park in Los Angeles serving as the venue in 2018 and 2019.
The event features dinner, a live broadcast of the Academy Awards Ceremony, and a post-broadcast after-party with live music. John tends to pick upcoming bands. The 2018 party featured the band Greta Van Fleet as the headliner.
Fundraising occurs before, during and after the event. Guests pay an entry fee in order to get in. Once inside, they are encouraged to pledge donations to EJAF in between the Oscars broadcast. Towards the end of the event, an auction is held, the proceeds of which also benefit EJAF. In 2018, the auction alone raised $725,000. The entire event raised 5.9 million dollars.
"An Enduring Vision" Annual Gala.
EJAF's other major fundraiser is an annual gala in New York that was started in 2001. The event is meant to honor longstanding partners, donors or supporters of EJAF with the foundation's Enduring Visions Award. The event is usually hosted by another celebrity and includes a reception, a dinner with the awards presentation, and a musical guest. The fundraising is achieved through the ticket fees and a live action similar to the one that takes place at the Academy Awards party.
Recent award recipients include Patricia Hearst, Steve Tisch, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The gala has been hosted by various celebrities, such as Gayle King and Anderson Cooper. Unlike the Academy Award Party, which usually features an upcoming or lesser known artist, the musical guests for the EJAF "An Enduring Vision" Gala are usually well-known artists from a variety of genres; previous performers for the event include Stevie Nicks and Sheryl Crow.
Partnership with ETAF.
Until her death in 2011, actress and activist Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John were close friends. Taylor was a public AIDS activist since the 1980s and founded the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation (ETAF) in 1991. Like EJAF, Taylor's foundation focused on fundraising for AIDS programs (especially focused on marginalized regions). She also engaged in plenty of individual advocacy; she testified before Congress multiple times to support AIDS-related legislation, including the Ryan White bill for AIDS funding in 1986. The two celebrities supported each other's organizations often; Taylor spoke at various EJAF events, and John performed at many ETAF fundraisers, starting from the very first ETAF benefit concert in Madison Square Garden on October 11, 1992. The two foundations have also partnered throughout their history to provide bilaterally funded grants to projects that fall within both of their missions.
In 2016, EJAF partnered with the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation (ETAF) in an initiative to combat AIDS in the Southern United States. They offered grants of $330,000 (funded by both foundations) to five different initiatives in the American South, a region that contains about 44% of the country's HIV-positive population. The five initiatives funded by the combined effort were:
Finances.
With the exception of a three-year period during which the IRS had to press EJAF to get their tax forms (1996–1999), the foundation has been deemed generally transparent and financially trustworthy.
Patrons.
Patrons include:
Ban in Russia.
In April 2025, Russia’s prosecutor general’s office designated the EJAF as an “undesirable organisation”, a label that bans the group from operating in Russia and exposes its staff and partners to potential criminal prosecution. The reason for this were the accusations of promoting “non-traditional sexual relationships, western family models, and gender reassignment”. The prosecutor’s office alleged that EJAF held “negative attitudes” toward countries that “uphold traditional spiritual and moral values”. It also accused the foundation of taking part in a campaign to “discredit Russia” since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

WIXO

WIXO (105.7 FM, "105.7 The X") is a radio station in Peoria, Illinois. It is owned by Cumulus Media, which also owns several other radio stations in the market. Cumulus purchased WIXO and its sister stations from Townsquare Media. Originally on 99.9 MHz before 2006, it moved to 105.7, a much higher-power license that reaches a large portion of Central Illinois.
The name is based on several factors, one being the frequency (105.7) and the other being the fact that it recently relocated from 99.9 having been under the name 99X, and the "X" in the name had become an inherent part of the station. The "X" in the previous name had come from the call letters WIXO. The station features an active rock music format. Also, on the original frequency, the slogan 99X Rocks! had been used and appeared on the station logo, and the phrase became commonly used as the station name. Thus, the new frequency uses the phrase "105.7 The X Rocks!", which can also be seen on the new logo.
105.7 before WIXO.
WWTO and WWCT.
The original 105.7 was operating as Drake-Chenault programmed WWTO in the early 1970s. In 1976, the station changed its callsign to WWCT and made its debut as an album rock station. Calling itself simply "106" or "WWCT" early on, by the 1990s it was using the nickname "Rock 106". Some of their well-known positioning statements included "Rockin' With The Best" and "The Home Of Rock n Roll." Much of their time was spent downtown on both Jefferson St. and 1111 Main St. They moved uptown in 1997 to War Memorial Dr. near Northwoods Mall.
In late 1998 Bruce Foster sold the station to Kelly Communications. Kelly took over immediately with an LMA and brought in satellite programming in lieu of local jocks. A "Peoria Journal Star" article talking about the station's DJs located in Dallas became fodder for competitor WGLO. In the summer of 1999, Kelly Communications decided to offer a lower price than what was originally negotiated in the sale, and Foster decided to back out of the deal. In what amounts to a legendary story, a group of jocks from the old WWCT days went to the transmitter site on a Friday afternoon and took back control of the station with the words "We're back, and we're pissed off!" Through the weekend a great number of former jocks, local leaders, and even competing radio station personnel took part in an anything-goes broadcast from the transmitter site in rural Tazewell County, Illinois.
In 2000 WWCT was acquired by AAA Entertainment Radio Group, moved towards an active rock format, and was named "Rock 105.7" towards the end of the format on 105.7 in 2003.
WXMP.
AAA replaced WWCT with "Mix 105.7" and the callsign WXMP, and marketed the station as a Bloomington-Normal station for some time despite the station being licensed to Peoria.
AAA Entertainment exited the Peoria market in September 2006 during a shakeup in Peoria radio ownership, selling 101.1 at Glasford, Illinois to Independence Media Holdings, who moved the WXMP callsign and format there, and selling 105.7 to Regent Communications, owners of 99.9 WIXO at Bartonville, Illinois.
WIXO.
WIXO debuted as the first station on the 99.9 frequency for Bartonville, Illinois in February 1997, and was known as "99X, Peoria's Modern Rock Alternative". It featured the alternative rock format. Original DJ's included Ian Chase, Jeff Williams, Stephanie Aaron, and Jay Wolfe.
The move from 99.9 to 105.7 allowed WIXO to be heard in an area around three times larger than it originally could.
WWCT, which was originally at 105.7 itself, moved from 96.5 to 99.9.

German Fountain

The German Fountain (; ) is a gazebo styled fountain in the northern end of the former Hippodrome of Constantinople (Sultanahmet Square) in Istanbul and across from the Mausoleum of Sultan Ahmed I. It was constructed to commemorate the second anniversary of German Emperor Wilhelm II's visit to Istanbul in 1898. It was built in Germany, then transported piece by piece and assembled on its current site in 1900. The neo-Byzantine style fountain's octagonal dome has eight marble columns, and dome's interior is covered with golden mosaics.
History.
The idea of Great Palace of Constantinople's Empire Lodge (Kathisma) being on the site of the German Fountain's, conflicts with the view that Carceres Gates of Hippodrome were found on the site of the fountain however, the hypothesis of Carceres Gates being on the site enforces the view that Quadriga of Lysippos was used to stand on the site of the German Fountain.
During his reign as German Emperor and King of Prussia, Wilhelm II visited several European and Eastern countries. His trip started in Istanbul, Ottoman Empire on 18 October 1898 during the reign of Abdülhamid II. According to Peter Hopkirk, the visit to the Ottoman Empire was an ego trip but also had long-term motivations. The Emperor's primary motivation for visiting was to gain approval for the construction of the Berlin–Baghdad railway, which would run from Berlin to the Persian Gulf, and would further connect to British India through Persia. The railway could provide a short and quick route from Europe to Asia, and could carry German exports, troops and artillery. At the time, the Ottoman Empire could not afford such a railway, and Abdülhamid II was grateful for Wilhelm's offer, but was suspicious over the German motives. Abdülhamid II's secret service believed that German archaeologists in the Emperor's retinue were in fact geologists with designs on the oil wealth of the Ottoman empire. Later, the secret service uncovered a German report, which noted that the oilfields in Mosul, northern Mesopotamia were richer than those in the Caucusus. On his first visit, Wilhelm secured the sale of German-made rifles to the Ottoman Army, and on his second visit he secured a promise for German companies to construct the Istanbul-Baghdad railway. The German Government constructed the German Fountain for Wilhelm II and Empress Augusta's 1898 Istanbul visit. According to Afife Batur, the fountain's plans were drawn by architect Spitta and constructed by architect Schoele, also German architect Carlitzik and Italian architect Joseph Anthony worked on this project.
According to the Ottoman inscription, the fountain's construction started in the Hejira 1319 (1898–1899), although the inauguration of the fountain was planned to take place on 1 September 1900 – the 25th anniversary of Abdülhamid II's ascension to the throne. Construction, however, could not finish at the planned time and it was instead inaugurated on 27 January 1901, which was Wilhelm II's birthdate. Marble, stone and gem parts of the fountain were constructed in Germany and transported piece by piece to Istanbul by ships.
Architecture.
The German Fountain was constructed on the site where there was a tree which is known as Vakvak Tree () or The Bloody Plane (). In the 1656 janissary rebellion, Mehmed IV yielded a number of officials to the demands of the rebels and these victims, when killed, were suspended on the Plane in the Hippodrome. Boynuyaralı Mehmed Pasha overcame this rebellion, which took two months and named Vak'a-i Vakvakiye, after becoming Grand Vizier. The plane named after Seçere-i Vakvak (Vakvak Tree) which believed to be in Jahannam and its fruits are human heads.The neo-Byzantine style octagonal fountain stands on a base with eight steps rising up to an entry gate. There are seven brass fountain spouts over basins on the remaining sides, and over the central reservoir there is a dome supported by eight porphyry columns. The fountain's central reservoir stands on a mosaic-tiled platform and surmounted with the bronze dome, which is raised on carved marble arches. There are eight monograms in the arch stonework and they represent the political union of Abdülhamid II and Wilhelm. In four of these medallions, Abdülhamid II's tughra is written on green background, and in other four Wilhelm's symbol "W" is written on a Prussian blue background. Also, over "W" there is a crown and below it a "II" is written. The fountain was surrounded with a bronze fence, but unfortunately this has been lost. The outside of the dome is ornately patterned bronze; the dome's ceiling is decorated with golden mosaics and again with Abdülhamid II's tughra and Wilhelm II's symbol.
The bronze inscription on the reservoir, which was written in German, reads "Wilhelm II Deutscher Kaiser stiftete diesen Brunnen in dankbarer Erinnerung an seinen Besuch bei Seiner Maiestaet [sic] dem Kaiser der Osmanen Abdul Hamid II im Herbst des Jahres 1898" meaning "German Kaiser Wilhelm II endowed this fountain, in thankful remembrance of his visit to the Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II in autumn of the year 1898". There is also an Ottoman inscription in the arch of fountain, Undersecretary of Seraskery Ahmet Muhtar Bey's eight couplet history verse is written by Hattat İzzet Efendi. The poem commemorates the construction of the fountain for Wilhelm II's visit to Istanbul.
Incidents.
The German fountain was the site of a terrorist bombing which killed 13 people (12 of them German) and injured many more on 12 January 2016.

Dancing Hare

Dancing Hare (formerly Lady Ghislaine and Lady Mona K) is a superyacht built by Amels in 1986.
Built for Emad Khashoggi, it was then purchased, also in 1986, by Robert Maxwell, who died by drowning in 1991 while cruising on the yacht off the Canary Islands. It was then owned by an Arabian businessman who sold it in 2017. The new owner, Anna Murdoch, had it refitted and renamed "Dancing Hare".
Design.
Built in 1986 for Emad Khashoggi by Amels of Makkum, Netherlands, it was the first of series of Jon Bannenberg designed super yachts. The yacht exterior includes a flared bow, lozenge-shaped ports, vertical windows and mullions and a sculpted mast complex.
Robert Maxwell.
Khashoggi, also developer of the Château Louis XIV and the Palais Rose, abandoned the project for the yacht and in 1986 sold the vessel to Robert Maxwell who named it "Lady Ghislaine" after his daughter Ghislaine. In 1991, it was the base for Maxwell in New York City, moored on the East River as he negotiated with the unions over his purchase of the "New York Daily News".
Maxwell's death.
On 5 November 1991, at the age of 68, Maxwell was on board "Lady Ghislaine", which was cruising off the Canary Islands. Maxwell's body was subsequently found floating in the Atlantic Ocean. He was later buried in Jerusalem. The official verdict was accidental drowning, though some commentators have surmised that he may have died of suicide or been murdered.
Subsequent owners.
After Maxwell's death the yacht was purchased by an Arabian businessman, who sold her in 2017 to Anna Murdoch, at one time the wife of Rupert Murdoch. It was only after the sale the new owner discovered the yacht had previously been owned by Maxwell. After a refit at the Balk Shipyard in Urk, Netherlands, over the winter, the vessel was renamed "Dancing Hare" in May 2018.

The chopin was a Scottish measurement of volume, usually for fluids, that was in use from at least 1661, though possibly 15th century, until the mid 19th century. The measurement was derived from the French measure "chopine" an old and widespread unit of liquid capacity, first recorded in the 13th century. A chopin is equivalent to 0.848 litres.

Still Life (2006 film)

Still Life () is a 2006 Chinese film directed by Jia Zhangke. Shot in the old village of Fengjie, a small town on the Yangtze River slowly being destroyed by the building of the Three Gorges Dam, "Still Life" tells the story of two people in search of their spouses. "Still Life" is a co-production of the Shanghai Film Studio and Xstream Pictures.
The film premiered at the 2006 Venice Film Festival and was a winner of the Golden Lion Award for Best Film. It premiered at a handful of other film festivals and received a limited commercial release in the United States on January 18, 2008, in New York City.
Like "The World", Jia's previous film, "Still Life" was accepted by Chinese authorities and was shown uncensored in both mainland China and abroad.
Plot.
"Still Life" is set in Fengjie, a city upstream of the massive Three Gorges Dam. Now marked for flooding, the city undergoes a process of self-deconstruction. Into this dying town comes Han Sanming, a coal miner from Shanxi province who has returned in search of a wife who ran away 16 years ago. Upon arriving, he asks a local motorcyclist to drive him to his former address on Granite Street. The driver takes him to the riverbank, revealing that his entire neighborhood has been flooded since the building of the dam. After a failed attempt to obtain his wife's information from the local municipal office, Sanming checks into a local hotel. His next stop is a rickety boat owned by his wife's brother. The brother informs Sanming that his wife and daughter (the real reason for his return) work downriver in Yichang but that if he remains in the city, they will eventually return there.
Sanming then befriends a local teen, Brother Mark, who helps him get a job with his demolition crew. Together, they spend their days tearing down buildings.
The film then cuts to a second story with the arrival of Shen Hong, a nurse. Shen Hong's husband, Guo Bin, left their home in Shanxi two years earlier and makes only token attempts to keep in contact. She eventually enlists the help of her husband's friend Wang Dongming, who lets her stay at his home as the two seek Guo Bin. Shen Hong discovers that Guo Bin had become a fairly successful businessman in Fengjie. Dongming refuses to say whether Guo Bin has another girl on the side, but Shen Hong finds out her husband is indeed having an affair with his wealthy investor. When Guo Bin and Shen Hong at last meet, she simply walks away. As her husband pursues her, she tells him that she has fallen in love with someone else and wishes to divorce. When he asks with whom and when she had fallen in love, she responds, "Does it really matter?"
Finally, the film returns to Sanming, who has been working at demolishing buildings for some time when Brother Mark is fatally injured in a collapse of a wall (or perhaps murdered during a "job" contracted out by Guo Bin to gather a gang of youths to intimidate the inhabitants of a rival piece of real estate). Soon afterward, his brother-in-law calls informing him that his wife, Missy Ma, has returned. Sanming and Missy then meet. Sanming asks why she left him; she answers, "I was young, what did I know?" She tells him that their daughter works further south, and that she works for a boat owner to pay off her brother's debt. Sanming attempts to take her with him, but is informed that he will have to pay 30,000 RMB to cover the debt. He promises to do so, and decides to return to Shanxi to work in the mines. After hearing how well mining pays, his new friends and coworkers say they want to join him, but Sanming tells them the work is very dangerous. The film ends as Sanming prepares to depart.
Production.
Filmed on location in Fengjie, "Still Life" was shot entirely on high-definition digital video by cinematographer Yu Lik-wai.
Casting was primarily with Jia regulars, including the two leads, Zhao Tao (who has appeared in every Jia film since 2000's "Platform") and Han Sanming (who also appeared in Jia's "The World"). Also appearing in a minor role is Wang Hongwei, who often acts as Jia's onscreen alter ego ("Xiao Wu", "Platform"). The film's crew also consists of frequent Jia collaborators. Most notable among these are cinematographer Yu Lik-wai ("The World", "Platform", "Unknown Pleasures", "Xiao Wu"), composer Lim Giong ("Useless", "Dong", "The World") and editor Kong Jinglei ("Platform", "The World").
Unlike many of his contemporaries (and indeed unlike many of Jia's own films), "Still Life" was approved by the Chinese Film Bureau, SARFT, and was co-produced by the state-operated Shanghai Film Studio. Jia suggested that this support was due to the fact that the "impact of the Three Gorges project is phenomenal. It’s not something the government can cover up."
"Still Life" was given a brief theatrical run in China (opening on the same day as the big-budget "Curse of the Golden Flower") and also heavily bootlegged.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack, by the Taiwanese musician Lim Giong, is mostly electronic, with elements of Chinese folk song. Parts of it are collected on the 2007 album "Jia Zhangke Movie Music Collection" 賈樟柯電影音樂作品集. In addition, several songs are sung or played during the film:
Style.
As in many of Jia's works, "Still Life"'s pacing is stately but slow. Unlike his earlier works, notably "Platform", Jia's camerawork in "Still Life" is constantly on the move, panning across men and vistas. Slow pans of men and landscapes mark the film's visual style. Shelly Kraicer notes that the slow, lingering cameras create tableaux of both bodies ("male, copiously presented, and frequently half nude") and landscapes ("long, slow, 180-degree pans that turn vast fields of rubble, waste, and half-decayed, soon-to-be demolished buildings into epic tableaux"). This visual trope has drawn references to the Italian master Michelangelo Antonioni and many of his works about urban displacement. Manohla Dargis drew a connection between Jia and Antonioni in regard to the opening shot, wherein the camera pans slowly across a long boat full of passengers; she writes, "In "Still Life" [Jia] uses human bodies as moving space, to borrow Michelangelo Antonioni’s peerless phrase, but with enormous tenderness." She continues: "Antonioni’s influence on Mr. Jia is pronounced, evident in the younger filmmaker’s manipulation of real time and the ways he expresses his ideas with images rather than through dialogue and narrative." David Denby of "The New Yorker" also made the Antonioni connection in reference to the film's story, wherein "Inanition and mere things have overwhelmed the human presence, as in one of Antonioni’s empty urban landscapes."
Visually, the film's use of high definition similarly creates unusually "crisp" imagery that draws attention to the beauty of both the natural environment and the decaying urban landscape.
The film has also drawn notice for its surreal and fantastic elements. They range from subtle (the tightrope walker near the end of the film) to the obvious, including two CGI images: one of a UFO, which serves to divide the stories of Shen Hong and Sanming, and a modernist building that launches upward like a rocket. Jia also uses four single-character title cards: "Cigarettes", "Liquor", "Tea", and "Candy." Some critics found this arbitrary, but Shelly Kraicer writes of the title cards: 
Reception.
"Still Life" premiered in the 2006 Venice Film Festival, where it won the film festival's top prize, the Golden Lion award. With its win, the film's profile was instantly raised. Upon seeing its success, Chinese press also gave the film and its director favorable coverage.
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Zhangke spellbindingly captures the human cost of rapid industrialization in modern China." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 81 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".
The film received acclaim from critics after its limited U.S. release in January 2008. "New York Times" critic Manohla Dargis wrote that it "exists on a continuum with the modernist masters, among other influences, but [that Jia] is very much an artist of his own specific time and place." Other critics, like J. Hoberman of "The Village Voice", praised the film and noted the more political undertones, consciously drawing contrast to the Fifth Generation director Zhang Yimou and his more recent big-budget epics. At the end of 2008, "Village Voice" and "LA Weekly"'s annual film poll of film critics ranked "Still Life" the fourth-best film of the year, and "Film Comment", official journal of the Film Society of Lincoln Center's annual poll of 100 film critics, ranked it the sixth-best of the year, with 521 points. The film was voted the third-best film of the past decade in a survey by the Toronto International Film Festival's Cinematheque, composed of 60 film experts from around the world.
Top ten lists.
The film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008.
"Still Life" was 75th on Slant Magazine's list of the best films of the 2000s.
In 2025, the film was showcased in the section 'Decisive Moments in Asian Cinema' at the 30th Busan International Film Festival, as part of the special "Asian Cinema 100", being the signature work of the director Jia Zhangke.

Randpark Ridge

Randpark Ridge is an upmarket suburb of Randburg, South Africa. It is located in Region B of the City of Johannesburg. It fell into the town of Randburg during the apartheid era. Developed in the early 1980s and still relatively new, Randpark Ridge is bordered by several other suburbs including Weltevreden Park, Sundowner, Boskruin, Bromhof, Honeydew and Fairland.
History.
The suburb has its origins as part of an old Witwatersrand farm called "Boschkop", named after the distinctive hill to north of the suburb, which is now the Boschkop Nature Reserve in the suburb of Boskruin. On this land, an old brick farm house was supposedly built on the land in around 1860. In 1903 the farm was owned by a J. Labuschagne and he sold part of the original land and farm house to John Dale Lace. He added on to the original Boer farmhouse; two gabled sections to either side, and a dam, built over the "spruit" (stream) that is a tributary of the Klein Jukskei River. At this stage the house had a total of 25 rooms. He would lose his 1300-acre country estate to Standard Bank, who sold it to an Irishman, Tom Kelly, in 1927. Kelly then renovated and extended the old farmhouse, changing its name to "Hy Many." A tree lined drive connected the farmhouse to the old Muldersdrift Road, now called Beyers Naude Drive. Kelly's daughter would sell the land in 1982 to the Gencor Trust and the land was rezoned for residential development. Attempts were made to keep the house and have it listed, as it was due for demolition, but no funds could be found for its restoration. By the early nineties it was run down and occupied by squatters before a fire destroyed the rear. By 1994 the old farmhouse was bought by developers who demolished the burnt out section illegally and in 1996, fifteen townhouses were built around it. The old farmhouse was modernized inside but the façade remains the same and has five original Jacaranda trees, possibly 90 to 100 years old. Regarded as the oldest brick house in Johannesburg it now stands in Frangipani Crescent, Randpark Ridge.
Current suburb.
The suburb is chiefly residential, with a few nodes for commerce along the major routes that service the area. It is well planned and forms part of Johannesburg's large man-made forest. Its proximity to both the city centre and Sandton make it an extremely popular area to live. It is, however, still close enough to the Magaliesburg so as to feel part of the countryside. The area is serviced by one highway, namely the N1 Western Bypass which connects the vicinity to Sandton and Pretoria to the north and to Roodepoort and Soweto to the south. The major arterial route is Beyers Naudé Drive (M5), which radiates from the inner city. Of importance are also John Vorster Drive and Ysterhout Drive (M6), as well as Christiaan de Wet Road (R564) running somewhat parallel to the freeway.
Rand Park High School along with Rand Park Primary School serve as the area's public schools. Trinityhouse High School, Newton House School and Aurora Private School are well-respected private schools in the area. The Randridge Mall and Rock Cottage are two well-known Randpark Ridge shopping malls, as well as the Lifestyle Garden Centre and several smaller malls exist for daily expenses. The prominent ridge (which gives the suburb its name) is protected as the Boschkop Nature Reserve, and is a prominent sight from most of western Johannesburg. Several parks abound including Essenhout Park and Hy Many Park. Much open land exists in the suburb especially to the west near to Honeydew.
Transport can be a problem for residents. The major routes are blocked in the morning and afternoon traffic, and this can make travel from the city centre much more difficult than usual. No train service runs near the area and thus it is buses and minibus taxis that offer the only public transport to residents. The nearest international airport is Lanseria Airport with the next closest international airport being OR Tambo International Airport in Ekurhuleni.

Suriname national cricket team

The Suriname national cricket team is the team that represents Suriname in international cricket. The team is organised by the Suriname Cricket Board, which has been an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 2002 and an associate member since 2011.
Suriname made its international debut at the 2004 Americas Affiliates Championship in Panama, where it placed last. At the 2006 ICC Americas Championship, the team won the division three event, and was promoted to division two for the 2008 edition. Suriname also won that event, and were promoted to the 2008 Division One tournament in the United States, but were immediately relegated after going winless. Since then, Suriname has generally alternated between the first and second divisions of ICC Americas events, most recently placing fourth (out of four teams) at the 2015 Americas Twenty20 Championship.
In the World Cricket League (WCL), the team placed last in the 2009 Division Seven tournament and fifth (out of eight teams) at the 2010 Division Eight tournament, relegating it to the regional qualifiers. Suriname re-entered the WCL system at the 2015 Division Six event in England, and subsequently qualified for 2016 Division Five. However, they later withdrew from the Division Five tournament due to an ICC investigation about the eligibility of some of their players.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Suriname and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.
History.
Suriname became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council in 2002. Their international debut came in 2004 at the Americas Affiliates Championship, where they came last in the five team tournament. A big improvement came two years later in the new Division Three of the ICC Americas Championship when they won a four team tournament also involving Brazil, Chile and the Turks and Caicos Islands. This qualified them for the Division Two tournament played in Argentina late in 2006, when they came fourth out of five teams, which means that they will keep their Division Two place in 2008.
Suriname placed fifth at the 2009 Global Division Seven tournament and was relegated to Division Eight, where it placed fifth to again be relegated.

Trade unions in Germany

 
Trade unions in Germany have a history reaching back to the German revolution in 1848, and still play an important role in the German economy and society.
The most important labor organization is the German Confederation of Trade Unions ("", or "DGB"), which is the umbrella association of eight single trade unions for individual economic sectors, representing more than 6 million people . The largest single trade union is the IG Metall, which organizes about 2.3 million members in metal (including automobile and machine building), electronics, steel, textile, wood and synthetics industries.
In 2022, half of all German workers were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In Germany, unions and employer associations bargain at the industry-region level. These large-scale agreements have broad coverage and lead to considerable standardization in wages and employment conditions across the country. Some bargaining occurs at the firm level.
Current situation.
The German Confederation of Trade Unions ("Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund" (DGB)) is the largest umbrella organization of unions in Germany. The eight different unions that belong to it cover many sectors of German industry, public services such as police, and higher and professional education. In 2001, DGB united 84% of all union members in Germany. While the number of members was over eleven million in 1991, it has reduced to 6.19 million in 2010. Of these members, about two thirds were actively employed. The following list shows the unions belonging to DGB:
In the 1990s, about three quarters of members of worker councils belonged to the DGB. This number has slightly reduced since then: in 2010, it was 68%.
Other umbrella organizations.
Other umbrella organizations that are not part of the DGB are:
Legal status.
Unions are considered to be social policy coalitions that are especially protected under the constitutionally guaranteed right of forming associations for the preservation and promotion of working and economic conditions. Agreements that restrict or obstruct this right are therefore invalid and illicit (Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, article 9, paragraph 3).
History.
1329: Strike of the journeymen.
There are sources of strikes and labor conflicts from the early Middle Ages in Germany. They were first fought by journeymen. In 1329, in Breslau, a group of brass locksmiths put down their work. In 1389, in Konstanz, it was the tailors, and in 1469, in Altenberg, it was the miners. More known is the uprising of the weavers in Schlesien in 1844.
1848/49 and 1865: The first trade unions.
While workers' associations were representing the workers' class in the pre-March era, the first trade unions were founded on a national level in the revolution of 1848/49. In the tradition of the guild constitution, these unions restricted themselves to single occupational groups.
After the establishment of the association of pressmen, associations of cigarette, textile, and metal workers were founded in the expanding German cities. In addition, there were associations of miners, tailors, bakers, shoe makers and construction workers.
The Association of Cigarworkers Germany was founded in Berlin in 1848. In 40 other German cities, similar associations followed. The General German Cigar Workers Society ("Allgemeiner Deutsche Cigarrenarbeiter-Verein"), established in Leipzig in 1865, was the first centrally organized union in Germany. This union became the model for many newly founded unions and is a predecessor for the Food, Beverages and Catering Union. In 1867, the Society of German Engineers (Verein Deutscher Lokomotivführer (VDL)) was established. After the Weimar Constitution allowed civil servants the right of freedom of association, VDL became the Union of German Engineers ("Gewerkschaft Deutscher Lokomotivführer" (GDL)). The GDL is still active today and is therefore the oldest union in Germany.
Obstructions against unions.
After decades of repression and obstructions through authorities, unionist organizations emerged in the pre-March era and during the German revolutions of 1848–1849 and articulated their demands. The failure of the revolution and the following phase of restoration, however, lead to a loss of strength in the union movement and caused new repressions against unions. Only new reforms in 1869 and 1871, enabled unions to develop as trade partners of entrepreneurs' associations. An example of these reforms is the trade regulation act that introduced the freedom of association and the freedom of trade. The workers' class had to fight for a living wage, while the business owners enjoyed feudalistic privileges. The unions were first interested to improve the situation of their members. They led labor conflicts, strikes and boycotts against the business owners. This increase in power and the danger for the governing system caused authorities to ban unions or to obstruct them by law. Generally prohibited were unionist activities between 1878 and 1890 through Otto von Bismarck's Socialist Law ("Bismarcksches Sozialistengesetz").
Only with the Halbergerstadter Congress in 1892, the unions gained power and influence again. On March 14, 1892, Carl Legien convened the Charter Conference of the General Commission of Unions in Germany ("Gründungskonferenz der Generalkommission der Gewerkschaften Deutschlands"). The unions with the largest numbers of members were thereby joining an umbrella organization in the German Reich. according to John A. Moses, the German trade unions were not directly affiliated with the Social Democratic Party. The SPD leadership insisted on the primacy of politics, and refused to emphasize support for union goals and methods. The unions led Carl Legien (1861-1920) developed their own nonpartisan political goals.
Classification based on professional and political orientation.
The German unions oriented themselves based on the policies of political parties and occupation or occupation groups, and not based on the principle of one company equals one union. These occupational unions are going back to the traditional guild constitution and the stipulations of the Halberstadter Congress. The ADGB and Afa-Coalition were close to the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Christian Unions were close to the Catholic Center Party, the RGO was close to the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), the DHV was close to the right-conservative German National People's Party (DNVP), and in the final phase of the Weimar Republic, it was even close to the Nazi Party (NSDAP). The syndicalist Free Workers-Union Germany ("Freie Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands (FAUD)") completely opposed party politics.
Enforced political conformity during National Socialism.
On May 2, 1933, the "Sturmabteilung" occupied the union halls and the Nazi government enforced political conformity among the unions. The wealth of the unions was transferred to the Nazi German Labour Front ("Deutsche Arbeitsfront (DAF)") under Robert Ley. In the DAF, many former union members were represented, although membership was not enforced. In 1944, the DAF was the largest mass organization in Nazi Germany, with about 25 million members.
Rebuilding the unions after the Second World War.
After the Second World War, the unions were rebuilt in Germany. The first leader of the German Trade Union Confederation, Hans Böckler, wanted all employees to be in a single unified labor union that had no political affiliation. However, the IG Metall, among others, resisted this idea.
In 1949, the Charter Congress of the Federation of German Trade Unions took place in Munich under the leadership of Hans Böckler. Both the prime minister of the Free State of Bavaria, Hans Ehard, CDU, and the labor secretary of the Federal Republic of Germany, Anton Storch, CDU, attended this congress.
Despite the calls to unite, the occupationally oriented association of civil servants and the German Salaried Employees' Union ("Deutsche Angestellten-Gewerkschaft (DAG)") were founded. In 1950, the Christian Trade Union Federation of Germany ("Christlicher Gewerkschaftsbund") was established but it never reached a high number of members.
The German unions DGB, DAG and the German Civil Service Federation became partners in collective bargaining with companies and the German government. They also influenced law making in the labor and social sectors.
Unions in the German Democratic Republic.
After World War II, the Free German Trade Union Federation (German: "Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund", FDGB) was founded in the Soviet occupation zone. The Soviet Military Administration in Germany increasingly required Communists to be represented in trade union leadership. After the foundation of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (German: "Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands", SED) through a forced merger between the KPD and the SPD in 1946, purges were implemented immediately. Christian-social and other independent social-democratic union members were dismissed and had to flee to West Germany.
After the failed uprising in the GDR on June 17, 1953, the remaining independent unionists were considered to be "reenlistee" (German: "Kapitulanten") or western agents and were dismissed from their office. This included the leader of the "IG Bau Holz", Franz Jahn, and almost all members of its board. The FDGB thus finally became a mass organization in the GDR controlled by the governing party.
Unions After the German Reunification.
Even in 1989, the FDGB was not at the head of the democratic movement. While forced reelections brought new leaders into the FDGB, it was considered to be impossible to reform and was dissolved in early 1990. Although the unions of the different economic branches of the GDR made contact with the corresponding unions in West Germany, the unions of the DGB decided to create new regional and local union structures. This decision was supported by a lot of union members from the GDR.
The unions first gained multiple millions of new members. However, after the collapse of the east German industry, the unions lost a lot of their new members. In the 1990s, the number of unions in the DGB was reduced from sixteen to eight. This was achieved by merging multiple unions into a single union for a whole economic branch. The DAG also joined the DGB as part of the merged union "ver.di".
Branch Specific Unions.
Because certain specialized branches considered themselves to be poorly represented through the DGB, they founded their own separate unions. Examples for this are the , , GDL and the . Some of these smaller unions have a degree of organization that is much higher than the average, up to 80%.
Weakening of the DGB.
In 2007, an attempt of a company to influence unions became publicly known that had been unprecedented in the history of German unions. Already in the late 1970s, the Siemens AG made arrangements to weaken the impact of the DGB. The first goal was to reduce the power of the DGB in the supervisory board. The essential execution of this plan started in the 1980s. The Association of Independent Employees (German: "", AUB) was founded. As "the other union", the AUB positions itself today deliberately against "traditional unions". Although the AUB has only about 32,000 members, the AUB chairman Schelsky said in 2003: "In ten years, we will be the only competitor in Germany to the DGB." And then his organization was supposed to have stronger political power. After it became public that Siemens had made payments of about 14 million euro to Wilhelm Schelsky, a business consultant and AUB chairman, the offices of Schelsky, Siemens and the AUB were searched by police. On February 14, 2007, Schelsy was arrested on suspicion of offenses in connection with taxes. The payments from Siemens to Schelsky are now estimated to be about 54 million euros. However, direct payments from Siemens to the AUB could not be proven.
Loss of Members.
In the 1990s, the German unions lost many members. In the unions belonging to the DGB, there were about 6.8 million members in 2005. This number corresponded to about 25% of the total number of employees in Germany. According to the DGB, the number of members was 6.4 million in 2007 (including retirees and unemployed). The union density (excluding retirees and unemployed) was 21.3% in 2000.
Structure.
Employees' representation in Germany has a dual structure: trade unions that set the framework for working conditions, such as collective wage agreements, for whole sectors or single companies, defining wage levels and working time on the one hand - and works councils ("Betriebsräte") that are elected by employees and represent their interests on plant and company level. They shape and supervise the execution of the frameworks set by trade unions, company policies and negotiate works agreements.
German industrial relations are characterized by a high degree of employee participation up to co-determination in supervisory boards ("Aufsichtsrat"), where trade unionists and works councils elected by employees have full voting rights. Local trade union representatives are democratically elected by union members and formally largely autonomous. Management boards of directors ("Vorstand") are elected by delegates.
Influence.
Trade unions in Germany define themselves as being more than a "collective bargaining machine", but as important political players for social, economical and also environmental subjects, especially also for labor market policy and professional education.

House of Ardenne–Verdun

The House of Ardenne–Verdun (French: Maison d'Ardenne-Verdun) was a branch of the House of Ardenne, one of the first documented medieval European noble families, centered on Verdun. The family dominated in the Duchy of Lotharingia (Lorraine) in the 10th and 11th centuries. All members descended from Cunigunda of France, a granddaughter of the West Frankish king Louis the Stammerer. She married twice but all or most of her children were children of her first husband, Count Palatine Wigeric of Lotharingia. The other main branches of the House of Ardennes were the House of Ardenne–Luxembourg, and the House of Ardenne–Bar.
History.
Wigeric's son Gozlin (911–942/43) became the dynasty's ancestor when he succeeded his father as count in the Ardennes and about 930 married Oda (d. 963), a daughter of Count Gerhard I of Metz and niece of the East Frankish king Henry the Fowler. His brothers were 
Gozelin's brother Frederick already acted as a ruler over Upper Lorraine during the reign of the Ottonian duke Bruno the Great, confirmed by Emperor Otto I after Bruno's death in 965. He was succeeded by his son Theodoric in 978.
Gozlin's sons were Godfrey, known as "the Captive", and Adalbero, Archbishop of Reims from 969. Godfrey succeeded his father in the Ardennes counties; he appeared as Count of Verdun about 960. He married Matilda, a daughter of the Saxon margrave Hermann Billung and widow of Count Baldwin III of Flanders. In 1012 his son Godfrey II was appointed Duke of Lower Lorraine by the East Frankish (German) king Henry II, in order to protect the lands against claims raised by West Francia (France). With Godfrey's uncle Duke Theodoric, both Lower and Upper Lorraine then were held by the House of Ardennes.
The line of Upper Lorraine dukes became extinct upon the death of Theodoric's grandson Duke Frederick III in 1033; whereafter his cousin Gothelo, son and heir of Duke Godfrey II of Lower Lorraine II could unite both duchies in his hands. After his death in 1044, however, King Henry III enfeoffed Lower Lorraine to his younger son Gothelo II and the elder, Godfrey III the Bearded, could only succeed in Upper Lorraine. When Gothelo II died two years later, Godfrey III claimed his rights but found Henry III unwilling to re-unite both duchies. He openly rebelled, campaigned the Lower Lorraine lands and was finally declared deposed by the emperor. Thereafter, Upper Lorraine was lost and passed to Count Adalbert of Metz, a son of late Theodoric's daughter Gisela, and his descendants of the Ardennes-Metz dynasty, ancestors of the later House of Lorraine.
Godfrey III could again strengthen his position, when in 1054 he married Beatrice, a sister of the later Upper Lorraine duke Frederick III, and ruled as Margrave of Tuscany from 1056. He reconciled with the emperor and in 1065 regained the Duchy of Lower Lorraine from the hands of King Henry IV.
However, the line of Lower Lorraine dukes became extinct upon the assassination of his son Duke Godfrey IV the Hunchback in 1076. Though he had designated his nephew Godfrey of Bouillon, son of his sister Ida his successor, his estates were seized by Emperor Henry IV in favour of his son Conrad. Not until 1088, Godfrey of Bouillon was appointed Lower Lorraine regent.
Possessions and titles.
The County of Verdun was given to Godfrey by Emperor Otto I between 944 and 951, and was held by several dynasty members over the following four generations.
The Duchies of Upper and Lower Lorraine were the result of the division of the old kingdom, later duchy of Lotharingia in 959. Following the death of the childless Duke Otto in 1012, Godfrey ΙΙ the Childless was granted the Duchy of Lower Lorraine. Godfrey was succeeded in 1023 by his brother Gozelo Ι, who also became Duke of Upper Lorraine in 1033. Both duchies were in the control of the dynasty until 1046, when the rebellions of Godfrey ΙΙΙ the Bearded led to the loss of both titles. Godfrey was finally restored to Lower Lorraine in 1065, and passed this on to his son, Godfrey the Hunchback. The Crusader Godfrey of Bouillon was a nephew of Godfrey IV the Hunchback, and the last of the dynasty to hold the Duchy.
The Castle of Bouillon is first mentioned in 988 in a letter to Godfrey Ι the Captive from his brother Adalberon, Archbishop of Reims. It is believed that this castle, and the estate connected, was an original patrimony of the dynasty. Bouillon was one of the central points of the dynasty's power, and was in their possession until it was sold by Godfrey of Bouillon to cover expenses for the First Crusade.

<doc id="7017744" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7017744" title="Thin layers (oceanography)">
Thin layers (oceanography)

Thin layers are concentrated aggregations of phytoplankton and zooplankton in coastal and offshore waters that are vertically compressed to thicknesses ranging from several centimeters up to a few meters and are horizontally extensive, sometimes for kilometers. Generally, thin layers have three basic criteria: 1) they must be horizontally and temporally persistent; 2) they must not exceed a critical threshold of vertical thickness; and 3) they must exceed a critical threshold of maximum concentration. The precise values for critical thresholds of thin layers has been debated for a long time due to the vast diversity of plankton, instrumentation, and environmental conditions. Thin layers have distinct biological, chemical, optical, and acoustical signatures which are difficult to measure with traditional sampling techniques such as nets and bottles. However, there has been a surge in studies of thin layers within the past two decades due to major advances in technology and instrumentation. Phytoplankton are often measured by optical instruments that can detect fluorescence such as LIDAR, and zooplankton are often measured by acoustic instruments that can detect acoustic backscattering such as ABS. 
These extraordinary concentrations of plankton have important implications for many aspects of marine ecology (e.g., phytoplankton growth dynamics, zooplankton grazing, behaviour, environmental effects, harmful algal blooms), as well as for ocean optics and acoustics. Zooplankton thin layers are often found slightly under phytoplankton layers because many feed on them. Thin layers occur in a wide variety of ocean environments, including estuaries, coastal shelves, fjords, bays, and the open ocean, and they are often associated with some form of vertical structure in the water column, such as pycnoclines, and in zones of reduced flow.
Criteria.
Persistence.
Thin layers persist from hours to weeks while other small-scale patches of plankton exist for minutes. The presence of nutrients as well as coastal fronts, eddies, and upwelling zones greatly increase the persistence of thin layers. One of the main criteria for an aggregation of plankton to be considered a thin layer is that the increased concentration at a certain depth of the water column must appear in subsequently measured profiles. However, thin layers are dynamic and horizontally extensive so their persistence cannot be defined using multiple measurements at only one location. A study on the Karenia brevis algae responsible for more recent and increasingly longer red tide blooms shows that the cellular gene expression patterns are extremely diverse which means that this particular species of plankton are more resilient because they adapt well to changing conditions. Studies also indicate that red tide blooms are often terminated by interactions with other microbes such as viruses and bacteria that may either compete for the same nutrients or adversely impact the algal cells.
Thickness.
Some studies have considered the maximum critical threshold for vertical thickness of thin layers as three meters, but more recent data has shown that the criteria can be relaxed to five meters. The horizontal extents of thin layers can reach tens of kilometers, and their horizontal to vertical aspect ratio is usually at least 1000:1.
Intensity.
The intensity of a thin layer refers to the maximum concentration of the plankton within the layer relative to the background and the water column. Thin layer concentrations can range between three and 100 times more than the background and up to 75% of the total biomass in the water column.
Formation.
Buoyancy.
Thin layers of non-motile phytoplankton tend to collect at boundaries of strong vertical gradients in salinity (haloclines), temperature (thermoclines), and density (pycnoclines) which often coincide because they are directly proportional. These particular thin layers are formed by sinking non-motile phytoplankton reaching a neutral buoyancy at a pycnocline, and the stifling of vertical turbulent dispersion at these depths. Other studies have shown that gradients in nutrients (nutriclines) also contribute to the formation of thin layers.
Vertical Migration.
Many zooplankton normally exhibit a diel vertical migration (DVM) pattern that dictates their depth in the water column based on the time of day. Phytoplankton require sunlight for photosynthesis and protein production, but they are not primarily attracted to light. This is evident by their single move up near the surface prior to sunrise and single move down into deeper waters prior to sunset. Their collective movements may result in the aggregation that form thin layers. These regular movements are thought to be governed by an internal clock in normal nutrient concentrations. However, they have also been observed to migrate irregularly when nutrient concentrations are higher or lower than normal.
Chemotaxis.
Motile plankton have been observed to be able to detect and swim towards higher nutrient concentrations and/or light intensities. This mechanism is called chemotaxis and is partly responsible for the formation of thin layers at depths where nutrients are abundant. Another mechanism specific to dinoflagellates is called helical klinotaxis where the algal cell's ability to respond to both positive and negative chemosensory signals is crucial to their motility. If dinoflagellates were not capable of both positive and negative chemotaxis, they would not navigate successfully due to the nature of the transverse and longitudinal flagella causing rotating and translating motions, respectively.
Eddies, Filaments, and Fronts.
Another obvious cause of thin layers is the horizontal transport of waters with high plankton concentration into waters with lower concentrations. In this case, upwelled intrusions of nutrient-rich slope water are suggested to be the cause of algal blooms and some thin layers. However, thin layers have been observed to form at the boundaries of more complex fluid mechanisms such as eddies, filaments, and fronts. These thin layers were located at the transition layer, a region of maximum shear and stratification at the base of the mixed layer.
Straining by Shear.
A fluid mechanism that contributes to the formation of thin layers is the straining of fluid by the sheared velocity profile which causes the fluid to tilt and disperse horizontally. If a patch of plankton is located at the fluid being sheared, a thin layer could be formed by the straining of the patch by velocity shear. The four phases of plankton distributions caused by straining are: 1) tilting, 2) shear-thinning, 3) decay, and 4) shear-dispersion (dissipation).
Gyrotactic Trapping.
A sharp change in flow velocities can also prevent some motile plankton from orienting themselves or swimming vertically. This fluid mechanism is called gyrotactic trapping.

Fast oil recovery

Fast oil recovery (FOR) is a technology in the maritime industry designed to facilitate efficient and safe removal of oil spills in emergency situations. It can be integrated into new or existing vessels to enhance spill response capabilities.
Oil spills pose significant risks to the environment, public health, marine life, and local economies. The severe consequences of oil spills, particularly damages to marine ecosystems, have increased the demand for ships better equipped to respond to potential oil accidents. Millions of vessels operate in North American waters, and a portion of them contribute to oil pollution. The Fast Oil Recovery system allows for the rapid removal of oil and liquid noxious substances from spills.
Some ships have installed fast oil recovery systems (FORS) to minimize oil contamination in bilge water. These systems are designed to remove up to 99.9% of the oil from a vessel’s bilge, reducing reliance on traditional absorbent pads and filters, which require frequent maintenance and replacement.
To address these challenges, companies like JLMD and Blue Water have developed oil recovery systems to mitigate the environmental risks associated with oil spills.
Research has shown that during wreckages, groundings, and other crisis situations, the oil trapped within the ship requires complex procedures and specialized technologies for recovery. Ship owners, shipping authorities, salvage companies, and other stakeholders can experience difficulties accessing the tanks to remove the remaining pollutants on board. These challenges highlight the weaknesses of current response procedures and the need for better onboard equipment to facilitate oil recovery.

At the Rebbe's Table

At the Rebbe's Table is the third recording by guitarist Tim Sparks on the Tzadik Records label.
History.
Producer John Zorn combined Sparks with Masada alumni Greg Cohen and Brazilian percussionist Cyro Baptista on Sparks' previous release "Tanz", and this time adds guitarist Marc Ribot on nylon-string guitar and Erik Friedlander on cello.
Reception.
"At the Rebbe's Table" received favorable reviews. Allmusic music critic Steven Loewy stated "Sparks treats the melodies respectfully as serious guides to a people's past, and in the process explores the life-affirming nature of the music." "JazzTimes" critic Josef Woodard wrote "Whatever the heritage or cultural pedigree, it's simply touching music."
Music critic Kirk Albrecht wrote "At the Rebbe's Table" "...may be Sparks' best yet in capturing the life and cross-pollination richly textured in these 11 selections from the diaspora Jewish communities around the world."

<doc id="7017756" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7017756" title="Legal aspects of ritual slaughter">
Legal aspects of ritual slaughter

The legal aspects of ritual slaughter include the regulation of slaughterhouses, butchers, and religious personnel involved with traditional shechita (Judaism) and dhabiha (Islam). Regulations also may extend to butchery products sold in accordance with kashrut and halal religious law. Governments regulate ritual slaughter, primarily through legislation and administrative law. In addition, compliance with oversight of ritual slaughter is monitored by governmental agencies and, on occasion, contested in litigation.
The most controversial aspect of ritual slaughter is the legality of unstunned slaughter, where animal welfare concerns regularly clash with religious concerns, and split public opinion.
Scope of regulations.
In Western countries, law reaches into every stage of ritual slaughter, from the slaughtering of livestock to the sale of kosher or halal meat.
In the United States, for example, courts have ruled that kosher butchers may be excluded from collective bargaining units, a Jewish beit din (court) may forbid trade with disapproved butchers, retail sellers implicitly stipulate their compliance with rabbinic courts, a state law (NY) may incorporate a rabbinical ruling on kosher labeling, and kashrut symbols may be subject to trade infringement laws.
In "Jones v. Butz", the action involved "a challenge, under the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment, to the Humane Slaughter Act and in particular to the provisions relating to ritual slaughter as defined in the Act and which plaintiffs suggested involved the Government in the dietary preferences of a particular religious (e.g., Orthodox Jews) group. The court held that there is no violation of Establishment Clause because no excessive governmental entanglement and by making it possible for those who wish to eat ritually acceptable meat to slaughter the animal in accordance with the tenets of their faith, Congress neither established the tenets of that faith nor interfered with the exercise of any other."
In the United States religious slaughter is not practiced under any exemption, as is the case in several European legal codes. Instead the Humane Slaughter Act defines religious slaughter by Jews and Muslims as one of two humane methods for killing animals for food:
by slaughtering in accordance with the ritual requirements of the Islamic and Jewish faith or any other religious faith that prescribes a method of slaughter whereby the animal suffers loss of consciousness by anemia of the brain caused by the simultaneous and instantaneous severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp instrument and handling in connection with such slaughtering. the other being using stunning.
The kosher food industry has challenged regulations as an infringement on religious freedom.
Secular governments also have sought to restrict ritual slaughter not intended for food consumption. In the US, the most prominent such case is "Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah". In this case, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled unconstitutional a local Florida ban on Santería ritual animal sacrifice.
The issue is complicated by allegations of antisemitism and xenophobia.
Lastly, recent debate in Switzerland has been contentious, in part, because of comparisons by a prominent activist between kosher slaughter and the methods used by Nazis in concentration camps. The metaphor was borrowed from the vegetarian and Nobel Prize laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer who said "I am not a vegetarian for my own health, but for the health of the chickens" and has one of his fictional characters say, "In relation to [animals], all people are Nazis; for the animals it is an eternal Treblinka."
Religious slaughter practice.
Islamic jurisprudence.
A 1935 fatwa by the Mufti of Delhi declared that stunning that does not kill the animal and thus is 'reversible' is allowed under Islamic law. Al-Azhar rector Muhammad el-Tayyeb el-Naggar confirmed in 1982 that stunning would not make the practice un-Islamic. Many Muslim authorities accept reversible stunning prior to the cut, such as electrostunning, or concussion with a roundheaded (mushroom-shaped) hammer. Supreme Leader of Iran ayatollah Ali Khamenei permits pre-cut stunning, while Iraqi ayatollah Ali al-Sistani forbids it. In 2014, about 85% of halal meat produced by the Muslim community in the United Kingdom was pre-stunned.
Jewish jurisprudence.
According to Jewish law, slaughter of cattle and poultry is carried out with a single cut to the throat. According to ShechitaUK, '[a]ll forms of mechanical stunning, which may include asphyxiation by gas, electrocution by tongs or water or shooting with a captive bolt gun, cause pain on application and are thus prohibited by Jewish law.' According to rabbi Norman Solomon (2000), some Reform Jews regard ethics as more important than diet, and reject the very notion of kosher meat. Within the North American Conservative denomination of Judaism, there is a broad consensus of accepting meat from animals stunned before slaughter as kosher. Without exception, Orthodox Jewish communities uphold the prohibition on stunning before slaughter.
In practice, a requirement for a shohet (Jewish ritual slaughterer) is that the shohet adheres to a high level of religiosity. Any kind of prestunning for livestock to be slaughtered according to the Jewish Kosher method has not yet been accepted by orthodox Judaism. In practice, kosher slaughtering is carried out by orthodox shochtim (authorized slaughterers) because the meat produced by Conservative slaughters from the Conservative denomination would not be acceptable to orthodox practising Jews and the limited market that would accept such meat is not commercially viable.
Historic bans (until 1945).
Asia.
Some rulers banned all killing on their land for some period each year, including ritual slaughter. Beop of Baekje banned all kinds of killing. In 675, Emperor Tenmu, followed by Empress Genshō and Emperor Shōmu banned eating meat in Japan. Tokugawa Tsunayoshi who was Fifth General Shōgun of Edo (Japan) made animal protection laws and when he died, about 8000 criminals (including 3800 in Edo) who had been convicted of violating the law, were released (see ). According to the Red Annals (Deb-ther Dmar-po), Möngke Khan prohibited meat eating and killing four days each month.
After conquering Bago in 1559, King Bayinnaung prohibited the practice of halal. Halal slaughter was also forbidden by King Alaungpaya in the 18th century.
According to the "White History of the Tenfold Virtuous Dharma" (Arban Buyantu Nom-un Caġan Teüke), Altan Khan ordered the religious code Arban Buyantu Nom-un Cagaja prohibited human and animal sacrifice.
Europe until 1945.
In the 1880s, anti-Semites joined forces with Animal Protection Societies to campaign for anti-shechita legislation to be passed in Switzerland, Germany and Scandinavia.
In Switzerland shechitah was forbidden throughout the whole country in 1893 after having been banned in the cantons of Aargau and St. Gallen in 1867 after plebiscites, and later a ban was introduced in the whole of Switzerland after a plebiscite at Federal level. The system of voting on individual policies using referendums (plebiscites) had only recently been introduced. and the first plebiscite in Swiss history was on the subject of banning shechita. The government and all the political parties were against the ban, but the popular sentiment prevailed.
Sweden banned shechita (Jewish ritual slaughter) of cattle in 1937, and of poultry in 1989. In June, 1937, a law, the effect of which was to abolish Shehitah, was presented to the Riksdag by Karl G. Westman (bondeförbundet) Minister of Justice. It was passed on June 4, 1937, and went into force July 1, 1938.
The law made stunning mandatory before the drawing of blood in slaughtering, but made it apply only to cattle, not to fowl and rabbits, and not to reindeer "until the King shall so decide". For violation, provision was made for fines, the money to go to the crown. Slaughter of poultry without stunning was banned in 1989.
Norway banned religious slaughter without pre-stunning in 1929.
Poland enacted mandatory stunning of animals before the drawing of blood since 1 January 1937, however by a ministerial decree an exception for ritual slaughter by religious groups has been enacted the same day. In 1938 the Polish Sejm passed a bill outlawing the exception for religious groups but it has not been accepted by the Senate and was never enacted into law.
Germany banned shechita nationwide three months after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. There had been a prior ban in the German state of Saxony, and the League of Nations had supported the Jewish Community of Upper Silesia against Hitler in rejecting the attempts by German officials to confiscate shechita knives and ban Jewish slaughter there as had been done in the German Reich. Bans were introduced in all the countries which the Nazis occupied. The first was occupied Poland where the German Governor-General issued a decree completely outlawing ritual slaughter on October 26, 1939. Similar acts were enacted in the countries of the Axis allies: Italy and Hungary. Bans introduced by the German Third Reich and by Benito Mussolini were removed by Allied Command after the allies had won the second world war in Europe.
In "Religious Freedom: The Right to Practice Shehitah", Munk, Munk and Berman documented every ban introduced in every country in Europe up to 1946, and made an analysis that claims that until the rise of Hitler in 1933, the international campaign to introduce ritual slaughter / shehitah bans had failed because the vast majority of countries where legislation had been proposed rejected the legislation realising the involvement of anti-Semites in the campaign and enacted legislation to stave off bans on Jewish and Muslim slaughter.
Europe.
In post-war Europe, there are three main sources of animal welfare law, namely the conventions and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) of the Council of Europe (CoE), the legislation and Court of Justice (CJEU) of the European Union (EU), and the national legislation of European countries, all of which (except Belarus and Russia) are member states of the Council of Europe, and 27 of which are member states of the European Union. While Council of Europe conventions and ECHR rulings only apply to Parties (that is, countries and the EU if they have signed and ratified the relevant treaties), EU legislation and CJEU rulings only apply to EU member states, and these sets of countries don't always overlap; moreover, not all Parties or EU member states may have (properly) implemented their CoE or EU obligations and commitments into national laws yet.
Council of Europe.
Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which applies to all member states of the Council of Europe and came into effect in 1953, provides for a right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion which includes the freedom to manifest a religion or belief in, "inter alia", practice and observance, subject only to such restrictions as are "in accordance with law" and "necessary in a democratic society." Preliminary discussions of the Convention referred specifically to religious ritual slaughter bans.
The European Court of Human Rights ruled in the 2024 case "Executief van de Moslims van België and Others v. Belgium" that legal requirements to stun animals, in a way that is reversible, before the cutting performed during ritual slaughter are compatible with the Convention. The court decided that there was no violation of article 9 or article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights and that the laws were justified in trying to protect animal welfare.
The European Convention for the Protection of Animals for Slaughter (1979, revised 1991), another Council of Europe treaty, generally requires stunning before slaughter, but allows its Parties to permit exemptions for religious slaughter: "Each Contracting Party may authorise derogations from the provisions concerning prior stunning in the following cases: – slaughtering in accordance with religious rituals..."
European Union.
There is no EU legal requirement for meat from unstunned animals to be labelled as such, and EU-wide proposals for mandatory labelling have been strongly resisted. This leads to confusion amongst consumers, who often cannot know whether certain products are the result of unstunned ritual slaughter. The European Court of Justice has ruled in 2019 that the organic production logo of the European Union cannot be placed on meat derived from animals that have been slaughtered without prior stunning.
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommended in 2004 that "due to the serious animal welfare concerns associated with slaughter without stunning, pre-cut stunning should always be performed". The 22 June 2009 EU Slaughter Regulation, approved by the EU Agriculture Council, allowed religious slaughter without stunning to continue.
The European Court of Justice has confirmed in 2018 that ritual slaughter without stunning may take place only in an approved slaughterhouse. Moreover, on 17 December 2020 it ruled that member states of the European Union may require a reversible pre-cut stunning procedure in order to promote animal welfare.
Some European states have banned unstunned ritual slaughter, while others have not. Meat from unstunned animals can be freely exported and imported between states in the Schengen Area.
EU member state laws.
Austria.
A complete prohibition on unstunned ritual slaughter was ruled unconstitutional by the Austrian Constitutional Court on 17 December 1998, as pre-cut stunning was deemed too much of a limitation on freedom of religion and thought; however, the Court acknowledged that the freedom of religion and thought could be restricted if it violated other rights and freedoms.
Post-cut stunned slaughter was introduced as the minimum in the province of Lower Austria in 2001. The 2004 Animal Protection Act (Bundesgesetz über den Schutz der Tiere; Tierschutzgesetz – TSchG) made post-cut stunning the nationwide mandatory minimum.
Belgium.
Unstunned conventional slaughter was banned in Wallonia in June 2018; unstunned ritual slaughter was banned in September 2018. Unstunned ritual slaughter was banned in Flanders in January 2019. Brussels still allows for unstunned ritual slaughter, but banned home slaughter in December 2017, and expected to debate a total ban on unstunned slaughter soon. Several Jewish and Islamic organisations challenged the Flemish ban at the Belgian Constitutional Court, which referred the matter to the European Court of Justice. On 17 December 2020, the European Court of Justice confirmed that the Flemish legal requirement of reversible stunned slaughter was not in violation of European Union law on religious freedom, and that EU member states have the right to introduce such requirements in order to promote animal welfare. In response, Brussels Minister of Animal Welfare Bernard Clerfayt stated that this ruling reinvigorated the debate on mandatory stunning in the Brussels Capital Region, and called for a 'serene discussion with all parties involved to find a good balance between animal welfare and freedom of religion.'
Denmark.
In February 2014, Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Dan Jørgensen signed a regulation which banned ritual slaughter of animals without prior stunning. Prior to this, religious groups could file for an exemption to the law that required stunning if they wanted to slaughter without prior stunning, although no groups had applied for such exemption. At the time, all halal slaughter in Denmark was performed with prior stunning, while kosher slaughter (which does not allow stunning) had not been practiced in Denmark since around 2004, all kosher meat being imported. In spite of this, the Muslim and Jewish Communities in Denmark strongly opposed the decree, arguing that it constituted an infringement upon religious freedom.
Finland.
Finland's law on slaughter dates from the 1930s and allows post-stunning thereby permitting kosher slaughter and providing certain legislative protection for some forms of Muslim slaughter. Dhabhiha (halal slaughter) is practised in Finland, but there are not sufficient resources for Jewish slaughter, and all kosher meat is imported. In Åland the law prohibits bleeding to death unless animals have been previously stunned or directly killed.
Paragraph 4 of the 1934 Act (enacted 14 April 1934), reads:
It is forbidden to slaughter a domestic animal in any other way, except to render the animal insensible immediately before bleeding. "Whenever religious reasons so demand", let it be allowed by the Ministry of Agriculture, in such a way, that the animal is rendered insensible immediately after the arteries have been swiftly cut, but in such a case the veterinarian of the institution must be present personally to supervise the slaughtering
During 1996, the debate over the practice of shechita (Jewish religious slaughter of animals) in Finland continued. Although a motion to pass a law prohibiting shechita (on animal rights grounds) was defeated in December 1995, thereby allowing the practice to continue in Finland (on the condition that the slaughtering takes place simultaneously with a stunning blow), parties opposed to shehitah were not satisfied. The debate has spanned several years, became an election issue during the 1995 general election and often took on an unpleasant tone, as the proponents of the ban (some of whom were politicians) equated shehitah with female circumcision and mutilation.
France.
Ritual slaughter is permitted, with some restrictions.
In "Jewish Liturgical Association Cha'are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France", 27 June 2000, (App No. 27417/95) the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights interpreted Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights in a case involving a lawsuit by Glatt kosher slaughterers against a French law recognizing a non-Glatt association (the ACIP) as having the exclusive right to conduct Jewish ritual slaughter in France.
The Court stated that ritual slaughter is a practice covered by the Article 9's guarantee of the right to manifest religious observance:
It is not contested that ritual slaughter, as indeed its name indicates, constitutes a rite or "rite"...whose purpose is to provide Jews with meat from animals slaughtered in accordance with religious prescriptions, which is an essential aspect of practice of the Jewish religion...It follows that the applicant association can rely on Article 9 of the Convention with regard to the French authorities' refusal to approve it, since ritual slaughter must be considered to be covered by a right guaranteed by the Convention, namely the right to manifest one's religion in observance, within the meaning of Article 9.
The Court then clarified the scope of Article 9, holding that it applies only to restrictions which would prevent consumers from being able to obtain ritually slaughtered meat:
In the Court's opinion, there would be interference with the freedom to manifest one's religion only if the illegality of performing ritual slaughter made it impossible for ultra-orthodox Jews to eat meat from animals slaughtered in accordance with the religious prescriptions they considered applicable. But that is not the case. It is not contested that the applicant association can easily obtain supplies of "glatt" meat in Belgium. Furthermore, it is apparent from the written depositions and bailiffs' official reports produced by the interveners that a number of butcher's shops operating under the control of the ACIP make meat certified "glatt" by the Beth Din available to Jews.
Thus, under the Court of Human Rights' interpretation (not unanimous) of the European Convention on Human Rights in the Cha'are Shalom case, restrictions on ritual slaughter are permissible, but only if they do not prevent religious adherents from obtaining religiously slaughtered meat.
Germany.
On 15 January 2002 the German Federal Constitutional Court held that the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany provides a broader guarantee of human rights in the area of religious freedom than the European Convention on Human Rights. In an appeal by a Turkish citizen who practiced Islamic ritual slaughter, the German court struck down Germany's former ban on ritual slaughter, holding that the German Basic Law's guarantee of religious freedom prohibited the German government from applying a law requiring stunning prior to slaughter to observant Muslims who practice ritual slaughter for religious reasons, and that the Basic Law's guarantee of religious freedom applies to slaughterers as well as consumers of meat.
The German court held that under Article 2.1 of the German Basic Law, religious slaughterers have a distinct fundamental right to practice a religiously recognized vocation. It also explained that merely permitting importation of ritually slaughtered meat is inadequate to protect the religious rights of individuals under Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the German Basic Law (Constitution) because personal contact is important to ensuring compliance with religious requirements. It held that an exemption from laws that conflicted with this was therefore mandated:
It is true that the consumption of imported meat makes such renunciation [of meat-eating] dispensable; however, due to the fact that in this case, personal contact with the butcher and the confidence that goes with such contact do not exist, the consumption of imported meat is fraught with the insecurity whether the meat really complies with the commandments of Islam...Under these circumstances, an exemption from the mandatory stunning of warm-blooded animals before their blood is drained cannot be precluded if the intention connected with this exemption is to facilitate, on the one hand, the practice of a profession with a religious character, which is protected by fundamental rights, and, on the other hand, the observation of religious dietary laws by the customers of the person practicing the occupation in question. Without such exemptions, the fundamental rights of those who want to perform slaughter without stunning as their occupation would be unreasonably restricted, and the interests of the protection of animals would, without a sufficient constitutional justification, be given priority in a one-sided manner.
Latvia.
Latvia legalised ritual slaughter in 2009. Halal meat products are exported to Sweden and animals are slaughtered using post-cut stunning.
Luxembourg.
Luxembourg has required since at least 1995 that animals be stunned prior to being slaughtered, and previously did not provide any exception for religious slaughter. The 1995 regulation has since been repealed and replaced by one that transposes European Union Regulation (EC) No. 1099/2009 of 24 September 2009 on the protection of animals at the time of killing into Luxembourger law. Under this new regulation, there now is an exception for religious slaughter, subject to authorization by the government upon written request on the part of the religious authority.
Netherlands.
Ritual slaughter is permitted, and regulated by a special convention concerning ritual slaughter.
The Party for the Animals (Dutch: "Partij voor de Dieren"; PvdD) was voted into the Dutch Parliament's Lower House with two MPs in 2006, increased to 6 MPs in 2017. Their election program had been to introduce an effective ban on ritual slaughter: Jewish shechita and Muslim dhabiha. The bill was passed in the Lower House of the Dutch Parliament with 116 votes to 30. Debate over the matter swiftly became a focus of animosity towards the Netherlands' 1.2 million-strong Muslim community. The country's Jewish population is comparatively small at 50,000.
Following months of debate a last-minute concession was offered—the Muslim and Jewish communities would have a year to provide evidence that animals slaughtered by traditional methods do not experience greater pain than those that are stunned before they are killed.
Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks visited the Netherlands in May 2011 to lobby against the ban, arguing that pre-stunning failed in up to 10 per cent of cases and that caused more pain than the swift cutting of the throat by a razor-sharp knife. He blamed the vote on "a mischievous campaign by the animal rights lobby, based on emotive images and questionable science."
Dr. Joe Regenstein of Cornell University prepared a Preliminary Report for the Dutch government in May 2011. The Dutch Senate (Upper House) held a long debate, and voted down the bill. Ritual slaughter is to proceed as before, with a provision for post-cut stunning should the animal survive for more than 40 seconds. According to various individuals and groups, the stunned animal will be neither halal or kosher.
Only the Freedom Party of Geert Wilders, the Socialist Party, and the Animal Party wanted to forbid ritual slaughter in The Netherlands.
Since 1 January 2018, a new regulation has been implemented that animals must lose consciousness within 40 seconds, otherwise stunning is required. Rumours spread that some Islamic abattoirs had started to stun animals before the cut, prompting conservative Muslims in July to raise concerns whether the meat would still be halal. The Utrecht Mosques Partnership called for a boycott of all Dutch meat during Eid al-Adha in August, forsaking the traditional sacrifice. They recommended having an animal sacrificed abroad and the meat imported until the availability of what they consider 'halal' meat within the Netherlands can be guaranteed. However, the Associations of Imams in the Netherlands (VIN) criticised the move, stressing the importance of ritual sacrifice in Islam, and saying the boycott 'violated divine law'.
Poland.
Poland banned slaughter of non-stunned animals in January, 2013, thus losing to neighbouring countries, such as Lithuania, an annual half-a-billion euro export trade to Israel, Turkey, Egypt, Iran and other Muslim-majority nations. The claim was made by animal rights activists that kosher slaughter represented cruelty to animals. The legal developments were complex, involving a government amendment to a law requiring all animals to be stunned prior to slaughter. The amendment allowed an exception to protect the religious freedoms of Poland's tiny Jewish and Muslim communities. The Jewish and Muslim Lipka Tatars communities in Poland jointly protested against the ban.
After pressure from animal rights groups, the Constitutional Court quashed the amendment on the grounds that it is not permissible to amend a law so that the original intention of the law is contradicted. In December 2014, the Polish Constitutional Court overturned the ban on kosher and halal slaughter since the protection of animals "does not take priority over constitutional guarantees of religious freedom," with Judge stating in her final verdict that "the constitution guarantees the freedom of religion which includes the carrying out of all activities, practices, rites and rituals which have a religious character."
In 2020, The Polish government had plans to ban the export of kosher and halal meat. They would later drop this plan.
Slovenia.
In 2012, Slovenia amended its Animal Welfare Act to ban all forms of ritual slaughter. A group of Muslims requested the Constitutional Court to review the law, arguing unstunned ritual slaughter was a key part of the Islamic religion and therefore protected by the freedom of religion. However, the Court unanimously upheld the Act in 2018, stating that 'the Constitution did not allow easily preventable suffering to be inflicted on animals without a justified cause', and that this provision did 'not disproportionally interfere' with religious freedom.
Spain.
Animal welfare is controlled under the provisions of the "Animal Welfare Act 32/2007, of November 7th". Article 6 of the act concerns slaughter of animals, including ritual slaughter:
When the slaughter of animals is carried out according to the rites of Churches, religious denominations or communities registered in the Register of Religious Entities, and the stunning requirements are inconsistent with the rules of the respective religious rite, the competent authorities will not demand the compliance with such requirements provided that the procedure is carried out within the limits referred to in Article 3 of the "Organic Law no. 7 of 5 July 1980 on Religious Freedom". In any case, the slaughter according to whatever religious rite shall be carried out under the supervision and according to the instructions of the official veterinarian. The slaughterhouse shall notify the competent authority that it will carry out this kind of slaughter in order to have it registered for this purpose, without prejudice to the authorisation provided for in the European Community legislation.
Sweden.
All domestic animals must be stunned before slaughter. Ritual slaughter of cattle without stunning has been prohibited since 1937, and of poultry since 1989. Halal slaughter of stunned animals takes place in Sweden.
In the rest of Europe the legal situation of ritual slaughter differs from country to country. While some countries have introduced bans, other countries—the US, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands—introduced legislation protecting shehitah.
Non-EU CoE member state laws.
Norway.
"The debate on Jewish religious slaughter in Norway first evolved in the animal protection movement in the late 1890s, but did not become a public matter until the Jews of Norway's capital Kristiania (now Oslo) were forced by the city authorities to abandon the practice of kosher slaughter (shehitah) within the city borders in 1913. From that moment and until the law prohibiting the practice on a national level was adopted by the Norwegian parliament on 12 June 1929, the debate made the headlines on several occasions in Norwegian newspapers in the interwar years. Hundreds of articles, letters and editorials discussed the case which was known as the «Schächtning-affair».1 The issue received especially much attention from the nationalist right-wing of the Agrarian movement, and the Jewish slaughter practice became subject to a massive campaign from the Agrarian press and from Agrarian party members of parliament. In its final phase during the 1920s, many of the critics were also heavily influenced by the modern anti-Semitic ideology that had evolved in Germany since the late 1870s. One of the most quoted statements from the debate was made by the Agrarian MP, and later prime minister Jens Hundseid (1883–1965) during the conclusive parliamentary session on 12 June 1929: «We have no obligation to deliver our domestic animals to the cruelties of the Jews, we have not invited the Jews to this country, and we have no obligation to provide the Jews animals to their religious orgies»."
Norway copied the Swiss campaign to ban ritual slaughter. The same arguments were presented as in the Swiss campaign and an appeal was made by the Jewish community to the Norwegian parliament not to introduce the legislation. After the ban was introduced, Norwegian Jews imported kosher meat from Sweden until it was banned there too.
In the 1890s, protests were raised in the Norwegian press against the practice of shechita. The Jewish community responded to these objections by assuring the public that the method was in fact humane. Efforts to ban shechita put sincere humane society activists in league with antisemitic individuals. Those opposing the ban included Fridtjof Nansen, but the division on the issue crossed party lines in all mainstream parties, except the Farmer's Party, which was principled in its opposition to schechita.
The Food Health regulations were controversial, especially the stunning requirement, as they would lead to a fundamental change in the meat producing market. A committee was commissioned on 11 February 1927 that consulted numerous experts and visited a slaughterhouse in Copenhagen. Its majority favored the changes and found support in the Department of Agriculture and the parliamentary agriculture committee. Those who opposed a ban spoke of religious tolerance, and also claimed that schechita was no more inhumane than other slaughter methods. C J Hambro was one of those most appalled by the discussion, claiming that "where animal rights are protected to an exaggerated extent, it usually is done with the help of human sacrifice"
Switzerland.
The Swiss banned unstunned slaughter in 1893 after a plebiscite so that a law requiring stunning prior to blood letting (exsanguination) was included in the Swiss Constitution. This required every abattoir to stun animals before slaughter, including Jewish and Islamic ones. The plebiscite had been preceded by a long anti-Semitic campaign, in which Jews were supported by Catholics, who had suffered under Otto von Bismarck in his anti-Catholic "Kulturkampf". Catholic priests gave sermons encouraging their parishioners to vote against the effective ban, and the results of the referendum showed that French-speaking Cantons had voted against the ban, but that German-speaking Protestant cantons had voted for the ban.
In Switzerland, a ban on kosher slaughter has been enforced since 1897, when the people supported this measure through a referendum with clear anti-Semitic undertones. At the time, Jews had recently been granted full civil rights and some Swiss citizens feared an invasion of Jewish migrants from Eastern Europe, who they considered to be unassimilable, foreign, and unreliable. By banning the performance of a core Jewish ritual, the Swiss people found a disguised way to limit the immigration of Jews into Switzerland.
According to the US Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour "Ritual slaughter (the bleeding to death of animals that have not first been stunned) was made illegal in the country in 1893; however, a 1978 Law on the Protection of Animals explicitly allows for the importation of kosher and halal meat. Imported from France and Germany, this meat is available in the country at comparable prices. In 2003, a popular initiative to protect animal rights and prohibit the import of meat from animals bled without stunning was filed; in December 2005, however, the sponsors withdrew their initiative before it had been submitted to a national vote after Parliament adopted a revision of the Law on the Protection of Animals."
The Swiss Federation of Jewish Communities (SIG), founded in 1904, regards the 1893 ban on unstunned slaughter as antisemitic.
There was a backlash against a proposal to lift the ban in 2002. "In 2002, when the Swiss government attempted to lift the century-old ban, animal rights activists, political groups (on the left and the right), and unaffiliated citizens expressed strong opposition. They called shechita practice a "barbaric" and "sanguinary", an "archaic tradition from the time of the ghettos", and asked Jews to either become vegetarian or leave the country."
Proposals to extend ban to imports.
Switzerland has considered extending the ban in order to prohibit importing kosher products. The Swiss Animal Association called for a referendum on banning kosher imports. Christopher Blocher, a cabinet minister for the Swiss People's Party, has supported calls to ban the import of kosher and halal meat. "A recent survey showed more than three-quarters of the population said they would like to see their government ban even the import of kosher meat." Erwin Kessler, president of "Verein gegen Tierfabrik (Association against animal factories)" who has several convictions for racial offenses, including the comparison of Jewish ritual slaughter of animals with the Nazi treatment of Jews, has been campaigning vigorously for this. He's 40,000 short of the 100,000 signatures needed to trigger a referendum to completely ban kosher and halal meat entering Switzerland. Kessler has inflamed the controversy by publicly quoting vegetarian and literature Nobel Laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer comparing kosher slaughter to the methods used by Nazis in concentration camps, but denies that his motives are anti-semitic."
In June 2017, MP Matthias Aebischer (Social Democratic Party) proposed a bill to ban the import of meat from animals that have undergone ritual slaughter. The bill also included a ban on foie gras, which is controversial because it is produced by forcefeeding geese which is widely considered cruel, despite being popular amongst especially French-speaking Swiss.
Turkey.
Stunning is not required in Turkey. Animal welfare organisations such as Eyes on Animals have been campaigning to raise awareness amongst slaughterhouses, religious leaders and consumers that stunning does not contravene Islamic law, and to voluntarily choose to perform or promote stunning, or buy products obtained through stunned ritual slaughter. In 2019, the large conservative sect İsmailağa publicly declared that stunning animals is halal, and as of July 2020, the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture was considering the introduction of a law that would mandate the painless killing of animals. Some companies have already started stunning animals because it's quicker, safer and cleaner, while the public is slowly accepting meat from stunned animals as halal.
United Kingdom.
Unstunned religious slaughter is legal in the UK. However, its legality is hotly debated by various religious and political groups and individuals. Both Muslims and non-Muslims, Jews and non-Jews are divided over the question whether meat from stunned animals is to be considered halal or kosher, and thus whether a ban on unstunned slaughter would or would not constitute a violation of the religious freedom of those Jews and Muslims who claim to have a right to consume meat from unstunned animals. Meanwhile, some animal welfare activists and groups argue that slaughter should be banned entirely, regardless of alleged justification.
In 2003, the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC), which advises the British government on how to avoid cruelty to livestock, stated the way Jewish Kosher and Muslim Halal meat is produced causes severe suffering to animals, and recommend the British government to ban Jewish and Muslim ritual slaughter (shechita and dhabihah). The British government rejected FAWC's advice. This elicited responses from shechita uk, and from Dr S. D. Rosen This is a continuation of a public debate that dates back to the founding or the Animal Protection Societies in the 1890s.
S. D. Rosen's conclusion in a "Viewpoint" article in "The Veterinary Record" is that "Shechita (kosher slaughter) is a painless and humane method of animal slaughter".
Food Standards Agency figures from 2012 showed that more than 80% of animals are stunned before slaughter for halal meat in the UK.
The debate in the UK resurfaced in spring 2014 after Denmark prohibited unstunned slaughter in February that year. It began with a 6 March 2014 article of three page long in "The Times" by the British Veterinary Association's president John Blackwell, who claimed that in ritual slaughter the animal must be alive when its throat is cut and die from loss of blood, annually causing more than 600,000 animals in Britain unnecessary suffering. Vice-president Jonathan Arkush of the Board of Deputies of British Jews confronted Blackwell the same day on "The Today Programme" by saying that "animals that are killed for the Jewish and Muslim markets do "not" bleed to death." He claimed that cutting an animal's throat "instantly" renders an animal "insensible to pain and unconscious", while on the other hand "pre-stunning fails to stun in between 9 and 31% of cases, depending on which animal welfare charity you go to", attributing the 9% figure to the RSPCA. Blackwell retorted that there is strong scientific evidence that, depending on the species, the animal remains conscious after the throat cut for an average of 7 seconds in sheep to up to 2 minutes in cattle, which is "unacceptable from a welfare point of view". Some Muslim and Jewish commentators accused Blackwell and his supporters of anti-Muslim or anti-Semitic prejudice, but Blackwell insisted that he respected religious beliefs and that "the Danish unilateral banning [was done] purely for animal welfare reasons, which is right". Numerous animal welfare societies backed Blackwell's position. National Secular Society campaigner Stephen Evans argued that the scientific consensus was clear that stunning was better for animal welfare, and that it was "therefore both reasonable and appropriate to suggest that, unless religious communities can agree on more humane slaughter methods, their right to religious freedom should, in this instance, be limited in the interests of animal welfare."
On the day the controversy began on 6 April 2014, it was reported that about 80 to 85% of halal meat produced by the Muslim community in the United Kingdom was pre-stunned. However, the percentage of unstunned slaughtered animals within the British halal meat industry grew by around 60% in the ten months after this controversy began, following a Muslim campaign to change the practice.
Other countries.
In the rest of Europe the legal situation of ritual slaughter differs from country to country. While some countries have introduced bans, other countries—the US, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands—introduced legislation protecting shehitah.
Canada.
Unstunned ritual slaughter is legal in Canada, provided that the food animals do not otherwise experience any other 'avoidable suffering'. According to the Safe Food for Canadians Regulations (latest revision enacted in June 2019), section 141, any licensed slaughterer must stun food animals either by concussion (a), electric shock (b) or gassing (c); however, section 144 exempts licensed ritual slaughterers from the obligation of section 141 to first stun food animals before cutting their throats in order 'to comply with Judaic or Islamic law'.
India.
The 1960 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act is the legal basis of animal protection in India. Provision 11 states that it is illegal for 'any person... [to treat] any animal so as to subject it to unnecessary pain or suffering or causes, or being the owner permits, any animal to be so treated', and that such mistreatment is punishable with fines or prison sentences. However, it also states that this does not apply 'to the preparation for destruction of any animal as food for mankind unless such destruction or preparation was accompanied by the infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering'. Moreover, provision 28 states 'Nothing contained in this Act shall render it an offence to kill any animal in a manner required by the religion of any community.' theoretically leaving open the option of unstunned ritual slaughter. On the other hand, stunning is required for animal slaughterhouses according to provision 6 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Slaughter House) Rules, 2001, and provision 3 states that slaughter is only permitted in recognised or licensed slaughterhouses. The Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulation, 2011 provides more precise stipulations surrounding the welfare of animals during the slaughter process, including that 'Animals are slaughtered by being first stunned and then exsanguinated (bled out). (...) Stunning before slaughter should be mandatory.' It further stipulates which three methods are legal (asphyxiation, mechanical concussion (gunshot or captive bolt pistol), and electronarcosis), the conditions in which these should be performed (such as separate spaces out of sight of other animals, with the proper equipment and the requirement that 'all operators involved are well trained and have a positive attitude towards the welfare of animals'), and explains why these are conducive to animal welfare. The regulation does not mention any exceptions or exemptions for religious or ritual slaughter.
According to "The Times of India", as of 2012, most abbatoirs in India employed electronarcosis at 70 volts to render animals unconscious before slaughter. As for unstunned ritual slaughter, scientific, religious and popular opinion remains divided on the question whether the dhabihah method (generally preferred by Muslims) or the jhatka method (generally preferred by Sikhs) leads to less pain and stress and a quicker death for the animal in question. Indian Muslim scholars also disagree whether meat from animals that are stunned prior to ritual slaughter is to be considered halal, with some saying it is, and others saying it is not.
New Zealand.
In May 2010, Minister of Agriculture David Carter issued a ban on kosher slaughter, rejecting the recommendations of his advisors. At that time, halal slaughterhouses were already required to stun their animals prior to killing. Carter held shares in a firm which exports meat and prior to instituting the ban he met senior managers of the firm who wanted a ban on kosher slaughter to reduce their competition. In November 2010, the ban on kosher slaughter of chickens was overturned, but the ban on kosher slaughter of beef was still in effect and kosher beef had to be imported from Australia. In June 2011 the World Jewish Congress adopted a resolution calling on the New Zealand Government to abrogate its ban on kosher slaughter. According to the Commercial Slaughter Code of Welfare, updated on 1 October 2018, all religious slaughter in New Zealand requires pre-cut stunning, with the exception of Jewish (kosher) slaughter of poultry.
United States.
The United States is one of the countries that has legislation for protection of shechita (Jewish) and dhabihah (Muslim) ritual slaughter.
The Humane Slaughter Act defines ritual slaughter as one of two humane methods of slaughter.
Since 1958 the United States has prohibited the shackling and hoisting of cattle without stunning them first.
In Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah 508 U.S. 520 (1993), the United States Supreme Court struck down a ban imposed by the City of Hialeah, Florida, on Santería religious animal sacrifices practiced by the Church as contravening the religious freedoms guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution of the United States. While the City of Hialeah claimed that its ban on ritual slaughter "not for the primary purpose of food consumption" was motivated by concerns for animal welfare and public health, the Supreme Court held that ample evidence showed that it was in fact motivated by animosity to the Santería religion and a desire to suppress it:
That the ordinances were enacted "'because of,' not merely 'in spite of'", their suppression of Santería religious practice is revealed by the events preceding enactment of the ordinances. The minutes and taped excerpts of the 9 June session, both of which are in the record, evidence significant hostility exhibited by residents, members of the city council, and other city officials toward the Santería religion and its practice of animal sacrifice. The public crowd that attended the 9 June meetings interrupted statements by council members critical of Santería with cheers and the brief comments of Pichardo with taunts. When Councilman Martinez, a supporter of the ordinances, stated that in pre-revolution Cuba "people were put in jail for practicing this religion", the audience applauded. Other statements by members of the city council were in a similar vein. For example, Councilman Martinez, after noting his belief that Santería was outlawed in Cuba, questioned, "if we could not practice this [religion] in our homeland [Cuba], why bring it to this country?" Councilman Cardoso said that Santería devotees at the Church "are in violation of everything this country stands for." Various Hialeah city officials made comparable comments. The chaplain of the Hialeah Police Department told the city council that Santería was a sin, "foolishness", "an abomination to the Lord", and the worship of "demons." He advised the city council that "We need to be helping people and sharing with them the truth that is found in Jesus Christ." He concluded: "I would exhort you . . . not to permit this Church to exist." The city attorney commented that Resolution 87-66 indicated that "This community will not tolerate religious practices which are abhorrent to its citizens..." Similar comments were made by the deputy city attorney. This history discloses the object of the ordinances to target animal sacrifice by Santería worshippers because of its religious motivation.
In sum, the neutrality inquiry leads to one conclusion: The ordinances had as their object the suppression of religion. The pattern we have recited discloses animosity to Santería adherents and their religious practices; the ordinances by their own terms target this religious exercise; the texts of the ordinances were gerrymandered with care to proscribe religious killings of animals but to exclude almost all secular killings; and the ordinances suppress much more religious conduct than is necessary in order to achieve the legitimate ends asserted in their defense. These ordinances are not neutral, and the court below committed clear error in failing to reach this conclusion
The Court also found that the city's proffered reasons for its ban simply did not explain or justify it.
Respondent claims that [the ordinances] advance two interests: protecting the public health and preventing cruelty to animals. The ordinances are underinclusive for those ends. They fail to prohibit non religious conduct that endangers these interests in a similar or greater degree than Santería sacrifice does. The underinclusion is substantial, not inconsequential. Despite the city's proffered interest in preventing cruelty to animals, the ordinances are drafted with care to forbid few killings but those occasioned by religious sacrifice. Many types of animal deaths or kills for nonreligious reasons are either not prohibited or approved by express provision.
Temple Grandin, who is both an animal welfare activist and the leading American designer of commercial slaughterhouses, has outlined techniques for humane ritual slaughter. She considers shackling and hoisting of animals for slaughter to be inhumane, and has developed alternative approaches usable in production plants. Grandin has coordinated this with the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Conservative movement in the United States, and in 2000 the Committee voted to accept her approach, ruling that "Now that kosher, humane slaughter using upright pens is both possible and widespread, we find shackling and hoisting to be a violation of Jewish laws forbidding cruelty to animals and requiring that we avoid unnecessary dangers to human life. As the CJLS, then, we rule that shackling and hoisting should be stopped."
In an investigation by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, undercover video was obtained of kosher slaughtering practices at a major kosher slaughterhouse run by Agriprocessors in Postville, Iowa. The methods used there involved clamping the animals into a box which is then inverted for slaughter, followed by partial dismemberment of the animal before it was dead. Those methods have been condemned as unnecessarily cruel by PETA and others, including Grandin and the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, but are endorsed by the Orthodox Union, which supervises the slaughterhouse. An investigation by the USDA resulted in some minor operational changes. A lawsuit under Iowa law is pending. Grandin's comment was "I thought it was the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen. I couldn't believe it. I've been in at least 30 other kosher slaughter plants, and I had never ever seen that kind of procedure done before. ...
I've seen kosher slaughter really done right, so the problem here is not kosher slaughter. The problem here is a plant that is doing everything wrong they can do wrong". In 2006 the Orthodox Union, Temple Grandin and Agriprocessors had reportedly resolved their problems. In 2008, though, Grandin reported that Agriprocessors had again become "sloppy" in their slaughter operation and was "in the bottom 10%" of slaughterhouses.
Agriprocessors faced accusations of mistreatment of cattle, pollution, and a series of alleged violations of labor law. In May 2008, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) staged a raid of the plant, and arrested nearly 400 illegal immigrant workers. Agriprocessors plants stopped operating in October 2008, and the firm filed for bankruptcy on 5 November of the same year. Sholom Rubashkin as the highest ranking day-to-day corporate officer was charged with federal financial fraud and sentenced to 27 years in prison in June 2010.
The Agriprocessors plant was bought at auction in July 2009 by SHF Industries and has resumed production under the new name "Agri Star".

Hallelujah, Baby!

Hallelujah, Baby! is a musical with music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Adolph Green and Betty Comden, and a book by Arthur Laurents. The show is "a chronicle of the African American struggle for equality during the [first half of the] 20th century."
The musical premiered on Broadway in 1967 and made a young Leslie Uggams a star. It won the Tony Award for Best Musical. In 2004, Laurents restaged the show twice with the same cast, in Washington D.C at the Arena Stage and at the George Street Playhouse in New Jersey, in order to update and streamline the story for modern sensibilities, and potentially move to New York for a full revival. The score was updated by Adolph Green's daughter, Amanda Green. Critics noted that although the score and performances were entertaining and had its merits, the book was still too outdated. 
Synopsis.
Georgina is a talented, beautiful and ambitious African American woman, determined to have a career. Overcoming many obstacles, she rises to stardom. She makes her way through the Great Depression, World War II, and the beginning of the civil rights movement. Her mother advises her to "keep her place" as a maid on a South Carolina estate, but Georgina negotiates the blocks to stardom from her negative and opportunistic mother. She encounters the racism that pervades society and show business.
Two men vie for Georgina's attention. Harvey, who is white, is able to provide opportunities for her. Her fiancé, Clem, who is a black train porter, cannot help her on her journey. By the 1950s, she is a successful singer in an expensive night club. However, Clem, who became an Army captain and then a civil rights activist, challenges Georgina's life goals.
Musical numbers.
"Witches Brew" had a tune that was recycled from "Call Me Savage," a song from a prior musical "Fade Out – Fade In" and was originally sung by Carol Burnett.
Productions.
The musical opened on Broadway at the Martin Beck Theatre on April 26, 1967, and closed on January 13, 1968, after 293 performances and 22 previews. It was directed by Burt Shevelove, choreographed by Kevin Carlisle, musical direction by Buster Davis, orchestrations by Peter Matz, with scenic design by William and Jean Eckart, costumes by Irene Sharaff and lighting by Tharon Musser. The production won five Tony Awards (out of nine nominations), including Best Musical, and Uggams and Hayman won the Tonys for Best Actress and Best Featured Actress, respectively, for their performances. This remains the only show to win the Tony for Best Musical after it closed. 
Laurents' recollections.
Arthur Laurents felt that "the original production was too soft in its take on black social progress during the first six decades or so of the twentieth century. It was originally written with Lena Horne in mind. When the steely Horne opted out of the project, it was rewritten to suit the more youthful and bubbly Leslie Uggams." In the 2004 production, Laurents attempted "to add levels of darker intensity... However, the music and lyrics are in the infectiously bright and bubbly style of musical comedy, and his efforts in this area reduce the charm and good spirits of the show without adding much of significance in the way of depth or insight." According to Laurents, after Lena Horne declined to do the show, "What we should have done is abandon the show... Instead it was rewriten for a woman who is one of the nicest women I have ever met in the theatre, Leslie Uggams,--and, God knows, she has a beautiful voice ... she was good, but it wasn't that original show. The show lost its edge, and I must say I lost interest in it."

Jordie Albiston

Jordie Albiston (30 September 1961 – 28 February 2022) was an Australian poet.
Early life.
Jordie Albiston grew up in Melbourne, the second of four children. She studied music at the Victorian College of the Arts before completing a doctorate in English at La Trobe University.
Career.
Albiston's first collection of poems, "Nervous Arcs", won the Mary Gilmore Award, was runner-up in the Anne Elder Award and Shortlisted for the New South Wales Premier's Prize. Her next two books were documentary collections, respectively concerning the first European women in the Port Jackson and Botany Bay settlements and Jean Lee, the last woman hanged in Australia.
"Botany Bay Document" was later transformed into a performance work entitled "Dreaming Transportation" by Sydney composer Andrée Greenwell. In 2003, the performance premiered at the Sydney Festival, and in 2004 was staged again at the Sydney Opera House featuring Deborah Conway. The ABC RN studio production of this work won the Grand Prix Marulic (Croatia). Twenty years after its original publication, Hannah Kent featured "Botany Bay Document" in her essay "Australia in Three Books" ("Meanjin" 2016).
In 2006, Albiston's biographical verse "The Hanging of Jean Lee" was used as the text for an opera created by Andrée Greenwell. Featuring Max Sharam, it was first staged at the Sydney Opera House in The Studio. The libretto of this work was subsequently shortlisted for the Victorian Premier's Prize for Best Music Theatre Script, and the opera was remounted in Melbourne in 2013.
Albiston's fourth book, "The Fall", a collection of chained verse, was shortlisted for premiers' prizes in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. This was followed by "Vertigo: a cantata", which utilises musical structures and devices in place of traditional organisational techniques and punctuation.
Albiston's sixth collection, "the sonnet according to 'm"', won the 2010 New South Wales Premier's Prize and was runner-up in the Chief Minister's Award (Australian Capital Territory).
"" is a hand-bound limited edition artists' book, with etchings by Sheree Kinlyside in response to one poem.
"[T]he Book of Ethel" consists of "perfect square" syllabic rhymed stanzas, charting the life of Albiston's Cornish great-grandmother. "XIII Poems" brought together commissioned poems written between 2009 and 2013.
"Jack &amp; Mollie (&amp; Her)" is a book-length poem comprising decasyllabic cinquains. Albiston had dogs with these names so it is likely the narrative is autobiographical. This title was twice noted in "Australian Book Review" 2016 Books of the Year.
"Euclid's dog: 100 algorithmic poems" uses various mathematical concepts and proofs as bases for its eight poetic forms. "This is not a book of high mathematics: rather an attempt to migrate some of the innate robustness, austerity and elegance of Euclidean thought into the realm of poetic structure". "Euclid's dog" was chosen as one of the "Australian Book Review" 2017 Books of the Year and shortlisted for the Queensland and New South Wales premiers' prizes in 2018.
A collection of found poems based on the letters and postcards from WWI Victorian soldiers, "Warlines" was written on a State Library of Victoria Fellowship. In the "Australian Book Review", David McCooey refers to this work as "a masterpiece ... Albiston reworks her source material into highly formal and stylised linguistic works. "Warlines" is – like her other collections – a technical tour de force". It was subsequently celebrated as a Book of the Year in the "Australian Book Review" (2018).
"[E]lement: the atomic weight &amp; radius of love" extends Albiston's longstanding conversation with mathematics and poetic form into the realm of science. These love poems are structured according to numerical facets of atomic theory, while embracing various historical aspects, anecdotes and fancies associated with the 70 or so elements included here. "Using chemistry as a trope, Albiston tabulates the human predicament of love: its foundations and fundamentals; its configuration of emotions; its recurring properties; and its assumption of elements yet to be defined." This title was shortlisted for the Australian Literature Society Gold Medal 2020 and the 2021 New South Wales Premier's Prize.
"Fifteeners" is a collection of 15-line sonnets. Here Albiston reinvents the sonnet structure, trading metre for syllabics, and employing fifteen lines in lieu of the traditional fourteen. "Themes of destruction and loss, hope and wonder, and the pressing state of an unstable world, are coded like enduring questions into the machinery of these extraordinary poems."
Albiston's work is well-represented in anthologies and has been translated into a number of languages. She has an entry in "Who's Who in Twentieth-Century World Poetry" and is mentioned in "The Cambridge Companion to Australian Literature" and "The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics" (4th ed.). Critical analyses of her work can be found in publications such as "Axon", "Biography" (US), "Feeding the Ghost: Criticism on Contemporary Australian Poetry", "Truth and Beauty: Verse Biography in Canada, Australia and New Zealand" (NZ), "Reclaiming Romanticism: Towards an Ecopoetics of Decolonization" (UK), "Humanities for the Environment: Integrating knowledge, forging new constellations of practice" (UK) and "Westerly". She is referred to as a major Australian poet in the "Australian Book Review".
Composers who have set Albiston's poetry to music include Andrew Ford (Australia), Leonard Lehrman (United States), Barry McKimm (Australia), Raffaele Marcellino (Australia), Rachel Merton (Australia), Peter Skoggard (Canada) and Kezia Yap (Australia).
Albiston was selected by "The Age" for its annual Top 100 list of "Melbourne's most influential, inspirational and creative people" in 2010, and is featured on podcasts on ABC Radio National (2019) and the "Australian Book Review" Podcast (2020). She received the Patrick White Literary Award in 2019 for her "outstanding contribution to Australian literature" (Perpetual Trustees), and was a finalist in the 2021 triennial career award, the Melbourne Prize for Literature.
Personal life.
Albiston died on 28 February 2022, at the age of 60.
Genre.
Structuralism, mathematics, documentary.

Murder of the Goldmark family

On December 24, 1985 (Christmas Eve), David Lewis Rice murdered the entire Goldmark family at their house in Seattle, believing the father Charles Goldmark was a major Jewish Communist official plotting to surrender America to a World Communist government.
Background.
The Goldmark family.
Moving to Washington.
In 1942, John E. Goldmark, a Harvard-educated lawyer and U.S. Navy officer from New York State, married, in Washington D.C., Irma "Sally" Ringe, a New Deal worker from Brooklyn, New York. After World War II, they moved to Washington State with their son, Charles, born in January 1944, and bought a ranch 250 miles northeast of Seattle, in Okanogan County, Washington, out of a desire to live off the land.
By the 1960s, the Goldmark ranch was 500 acres. They cultivated wheat and raised cattle there. John Goldmark became a leading Democratic local leader, being elected as a state representative in the Washington House of Representatives in Olympia in 1956. Goldmark was re-elected two more times in the Okanogan Republican-leaning district.
Accusations of Communism.
In 1962, while Goldmark prepared for his fourth re-election, he was accused by two local newspapers of being a Communist sympathizer.
In the "Catching Up With John" editorial in the "Tonasket Tribune" by editor Ashley Holden, John Goldmark was accused of being complicit in “a monstrous conspiracy to remake America into a totalitarian state which would throttle freedom and crush individual initiative.” On another occasion, Holden described Goldmark as "the idol of the Pinkos and ultra-liberals who infest every session of the legislature." Holden and other confederates used as arguments in their campaign the fact that Charles Goldmark went to the liberal Reed College and that Sally, during the Great Depression, joined the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA). Sally's interest in folk music was also cited as evidence of her communist sympathies. Former Republican state legislator and former chairman of the Washington State Un-American Activities Committee Albert F. Canwell, in a taped interview, accused Sally of having belonged to the CPUSA in 1948 - five years later than when she claimed to have left the party. Canwell once referred to Sally Goldmark as a "lesbian communist."
On August 23, 1962, a "non-political" rally was held at an Okanogan American Legion hall, presided over by Loris Gillespie, a local orchardist and former county Republican chairman. Gillespie accused the American Civil Liberties Union, of whose state committee John Goldmark was a member, of being a Communist front. Ashley Holden published the article "Commie "Front" Exposed by Al Canwell in Legion Talk" about this incident in the same "Tonasket Tribune" issue along with his editorial "Catching Up With John." After this 1962 political campaign smear, John Goldmark lost the nomination of his party.
The Goldmarks then hired attorney William Lee Dwyer and sued Holden and his allies for libel, winning $40,000 (U.S.) in damages. This ruling was later reversed on the basis of "New York Times Co. v. Sullivan" in a ruling which stated that, although the accusations were clearly false, there was no evidence they were done with malice.
The Goldmark family later moved to Seattle. John Goldmark never held political office again and died in 1979 of cancer. Sally Goldmark died in early 1985.
Charles Goldmark.
After graduating from Reed College in Portland, Oregon, Charles enrolled in Yale Law School and joined an officers training program to become a military intelligence officer. While serving in Europe, he met Annie J. Carlstén, a French interpreter whose father was Swedish while her mother was French. Annie and Charles soon married, moved to Seattle, and had two sons. Charles joined the law firm Davis, Wright, Todd, Riese, and Jones, before leaving the firm in 1976 with his friend, Jim Wickwire (one of the first two U.S. mountain climbers to reach the K2 peak), to begin a new law firm, Wickwire, Lewis, Goldmark, and Schorr. Charles specialized in civil litigation. Meanwhile, his wife, Annie, continued her career in translating.
In addition to his legal work, Charles also worked in politics, becoming a legal counsel for the Washington State Democratic Party and serving as the delegate for Gary Hart during the 1984 Democratic National Convention.
David Lewis Rice.
David Lewis Rice was born in 1958 in Durango, Colorado. His family moved during his childhood along with the father, who traveled across the Southwestern United States for his work in construction. At age four, Rice ran into a sliding glass door which shattered, cutting his right eyebrow and leaving him partially blind in that eye. At age ten, after an argument with his brother, he locked the door of his room and attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself. As a teenager, Rice had grown to 6 feet 2 inches (187.96 cm). Rice dropped out of high school in the 10th grade and joined the US Navy before being discharged during training. Later, Rice married and had a son, but his wife sued for divorce. He worked as a welder before being dismissed due to bankruptcy.
In 1982, Rice was living in Seattle, sleeping in homeless shelters or in cars before meeting 40-year-old naturopath Anne Davis, with whom he had a relationship, before moving to her Capitol Hill apartment to live from time to time. Anne Davis introduced Rice to the Duck Club, an antisemitic, anti-communist, right-wing and ultra-nationalist study group led by retired U.S. Army Colonel Gordon "Jack" Mohr, self-proclaimed "national military commander" of the Christian Patriots Defense League, and whose Seattle chapter was led by former Boeing employee Homer Brand. Rice was so enamored with Mohr's articles, he attempted to contact Mohr in Mississippi where he lived, only to be rebuffed. Rice started to believe in a "Communist conspiracy aided by the international bankers and the Federal Reserve Board", as his defense counsel later said.
Among the subjects discussed during Duck Club meetings were the alleged Communist ties of the Goldmark family, leading Rice to research the subject. Rice concluded that Charles Goldmark was the “regional director of the American Communist Party” and that Rice had to act to save America. Meanwhile, Rice's financial situation began to worsen, as he found himself deeper and deeper in debt and his unemployment compensation ran out 4 or 5 months prior to the murders.
Murder.
Preparation.
Rice's girlfriend, Anne Davis, had gone on vacation for Christmas and had left food and money for him with the understanding he would be out when she came back. Rice pawned Davis's television for $10.
Days before the murders, Rice tested chloroform on himself and bought a pair of manacles and a toy pistol. He also bought an M1 Garand but decided not to use it because of the noise it would have made. These items and other tools and weapons appeared in a list entitled "Basic Armament for One Man Mission" in a notebook, written by Rice, found by police in a search of Anne Davis' apartment two days after the crime.
Rice planned to torture Charles to force him to give a list of Communist operatives and then murder him, in order to work his way up to the ladder of the Communist hierarchy. Rice also wanted the Goldmarks' money, since he imagined they were wealthy. It was later determined that Rice's motivation to commit the murders was based equally on both political and financial factors.
On approximately November 1, Rice traveled to the Goldmarks' neighborhood to "see what kind of house it was and just to check out the neighborhood" and failed to see to what Charles and Annie looked like. One week later, Rice visited Goldmark's office building but failed to see Charles and in December he went back to their house and was not able to see if they lived there.
Massacre of the Goldmark family.
On Christmas Eve 1985, Rice, posing as a taxi cab driver who had a package to deliver, gained entry to the Seattle home of Charles Goldmark. Rice had previously gone to the house of a neighbor before learning he was mistaken, and then going to the Goldmarks' house.
Rice confessed to having wanted for the previous six months to murder the Goldmarks, but insisted that he did not include the Goldmark children, who he thought would have been absent the day of the killings. Rice stated: "The children - I didn't expect them." However once he found them in the house on the day of the attack Rice determined that he had to kill them as well.
At 7:10 p.m., he tied the family up: Charles, his wife Annie, and their two children, 12-year-old Derek and 10-year-old Colin. He then chloroformed them after robbing them of their valuables (including a bank card Charles gave him a false access number for, and the keys for their car) and learning guests were coming for 7:30. Fearing he could not have enough time to extract information about the Communist conspiracy from Charles, and that the Goldmark family could identify him, he searched for a weapon, settled for a steam iron and a kitchen knife and bludgeoned and stabbed them to death before leaving.
During the investigation, it was determined that, after they were chloroformed, Rice first struck Charles with four to five blows with the pointed edge of the steam iron to the head and then did the same to Annie, striking her strongly enough to cause her to move; after additional blows, she ceased to move. Rice then did the same to the children before checking whether their father was still alive by seeing whether the arteries on the neck still had any activity pointing to a beating pulse. Finding both Charles and Annie were still alive, Rice "decided to complete the job with the knife" and started with Charles, inserting the blade in the wound created by the bludgeoning, hitting the opposite end of the skull to a depth of five inches through the brain. Rice did the same to the children and then, not finding any skull injury on Annie, stabbed her in the chest.
Discovery of the bodies.
As planned, at 7:30 p.m., the guests arrived at the Goldmark residence, rang the doorbell and, since nobody answered, went back home. Once there, they phoned the Goldmarks and grew alarmed when the Goldmarks still did not answer, at which point the guests returned to the Goldmark residence.
This time they heard moaning from inside the house. They drove to the nearby home of Jeffrey Haley, where they knew they could find a key to the Goldmark house, then returned to open the door with Jeffrey and his brother Peter. Once there, they climbed the stairs, entered the room and saw the entire family had been tied up. Annie had been stabbed in her chest while Charles and their two sons appeared to have been wounded in the head. Both parents had been handcuffed with their arms behind their backs. Charles was yelling and thrashing on the floor, not noticing the Haleys were present; the latter used a hacksaw to remove the handcuffs of Charles to ease his distress.
Police officers and firefighters came to the house. The police gathered evidence, finding the clothes iron and the kitchen knife, while firefighters helped the victims. Annie was pronounced dead at the scene. The firemen could not insert their fingers inside the sweaters that were so tightly wound around the necks of the boys. Blood was splattered on nearly every wall, especially around the bodies of the victims, indicating that the victims were struck while they were on the floor. The victims were soon sent to Harborview Medical Center where Colin died four days later, Charles held on for 16 days, and Derek lasted 37 days.
On the same evening, Christmas Eve 1985, shortly after his murderous assault on the Goldmark family, Rice made an attempt to retrieve items bearing his fingerprints at the crime scene, but gave up on that idea after seeing the heavy police presence there.
Arrest of David Lewis Rice.
Two days later, on December 26, police received a phone call from Robert Brown, a.k.a. Husayn Omar Sayfuddiya, a Duck Club acquaintance with whom Rice lived since the murders, to tell them he believed his guest had been involved in the murders of the Goldmark family, basing this on a confession Rice wrote in his guestbook consisting of the sentence "To whom it may concern, I am the person you are looking for in the Goldmark case." Police came to Brown's residence, where he confirmed the guest was David Rice.
While waiting for detectives to come, police saw someone matching the description of Rice and pursued him. As they were closer to catching him, Rice drank a potion later revealed to be liquid nicotine.
At the police station, after receiving a Miranda warning, Rice was shown his guestbook and he confirmed his possession of the book and his authorship of several messages, including the confession. He agreed to complete the confession, and wrote the following:
At this point Rice asked for an attorney and Seattle lawyer William Lanning came to speak to him for an hour and a half, concluding with Lanning telling the policemen his client agreed to speak to them even though he knew his declarations could be used against him. Rice confessed the crime to two detectives in a tape-recorded testimony, explaining his motivations, his preparations for the attacks, and manner of the murders.
Rice also told Homer Brand that he “dumped the top communist. There were four involved.” After Rice's arrest, information and documents about municipal bond lawyer and civic activist James R. Ellis were found among his belongings, leading to speculation that Ellis was the next target.
Legal process.
At trial, Rice invoked the insanity defense, arguing that he was not responsible for the crime; his lawyer, Anthony Savage, stated that Rice's associations with right-wing groups exacerbated his paranoid delusional disorder, which three doctors, examining Rice, all diagnosed. Prosecution was assured by Bill Downing and his assistant Bob Lasnik.
Rice was convicted on June 5, 1986, of aggravated murder for the four deaths and was sentenced to death five days later, on June 10, 1986.
The conviction was later overturned on the grounds that Lannen had provided him with an incompetent defense. Rice repeatedly displayed psychotic symptoms throughout his trial, but his attorney failed to emphasize them in his defense.
In 1998, Rice pleaded guilty to the crimes in exchange for avoiding the death penalty. He remains in prison serving out a life sentence.
The Goldmark Murders remain one of the most notorious antisemitic hate crimes as well as politically motivated killings in recent memory in the United States, even though the victims were not actually Jewish and Communist as the killer mistakenly believed. There was a controversy over whether Rice had been influenced by the Duck Club. It also remains a cause célèbre of capital punishment proponents, since Rice avoided death based only on the ineptitude of his attorney's work at trial.
Rice is currently incarcerated in Washington State Penitentiary and was interviewed for the 1987 PBS documentary, "Faces of the Enemy".
Legacy.
In 1986, the Goldmark Foundation was established, with the purpose of giving to the cause the Goldmark family would have supported, contributing more than $200,000 to various local causes, or $500,000 if matching dollars were also counted. In the beginning, it gave small grants, around $2,500, to small nonprofit groups that needed modest boosts, before switching to give more substantial grants, in the range of $25,000 range, to make an enduring impact. Among the beneficiaries were:
In 1992, a plaque was inaugurated in Seattle, at Madrona Drive and Lake Washington Boulevard, in the newly named Goldmark Overlook, to honor the Goldmark family. This plaque read:
It was the first time in Seattle that private citizens who had been murder victims ever received a memorial. The Goldmark Foundation donated $15,000 for the $83,000 overlook, a part of the plan by the local Parks and Recreation Department to beautify the lakefront.
Charles Goldmark's brother, Peter J. Goldmark, is former Washington State Commissioner of Public Lands and head of the Washington Department of Natural Resources.

Charles Fiddian-Green

Charles Anderson Fiddian Fiddian-Green (22 December 1898 – 5 September 1976) was an English cricketer: an opening batsman who played 107 first-class matches between the wars, playing county cricket for both Warwickshire and Worcestershire, as well as university cricket for Cambridge University.
Fiddian-Green first played in June 1920 "against" Cambridge University. He was by this time a student at Jesus College, having gone there at the age of 21 because of the First World War, but in this match he played for Warwickshire. He had a quiet game, scoring 1 and 23 not out, taking one catch and bowling a single over. He played another 14 times for the county that season, although only rarely did he catch the eye: he made 53* (albeit out of 603/9 declared) against Worcestershire in early August, and in other games took two wickets: those of Lancashire's Robert Boddington and Middlesex's future Test all-rounder Nigel Haig.
In 1921 Fiddian-Green had a much better season for both Cambridge and Warwickshire, passing 1000 first-class runs for the first of two occasions (the other being the following year); his aggregate of 1079 was the best of his career. He won his blue, scoring 17 in his only visit to the crease as Cambridge beat Oxford by an innings. He passed fifty eight times in his 38 innings, although he never managed to go on to three figures; his highest score of the season was the 95 he hit for Cambridge "against" Warwickshire in June.
1922 saw him gain a second blue – and again Cambridge won by an innings – but the match was perhaps more remarkable for the manner of Fiddian-Green's dismissal. He was bowled for 23 by Thomas Raikes by a ball which was said to have pitched so wide as to be almost off the mown area of the pitch. He enjoyed excellent form with the bat for much of the season, averaging 42.28 in all first-class cricket and 49.21 for Cambridge alone. In one purple patch in mid-season, he scored 83, 103, 113 and 120 in successive innings; this last, against HDG Leveson-Gower's XI, remained the highest score of his career. He was also selected to represent the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, where he made 27 and 1.
Fiddian-Green then became a master, and head of cricket, at Malvern College, and played no first-class cricket in 1923. However, for the following few years he did turn out for Warwickshire a few times a season during the school holidays, usually scoring good runs. There was then another gap until 1931, when he appeared for Worcestershire and scored 108 on debut against Essex. He kept wicket on a couple of occasions, and stumped Arthur Pothecary of Hampshire in August 1933.
His final first-class appearance came against his old university in late June 1934, when he made 5 and 45. Outside cricket, Fiddian-Green represented Cambridge University at both hockey and golf. He died in Malvern, Worcestershire, at the age of 77.

Perennial Favorites

Perennial Favorites is an album by the swing revival band Squirrel Nut Zippers, released in 1998.
The album peaked at No. 18 on the "Billboard" 200. It achieved gold status.
Production.
The album was recorded at Ken Mosher's studio in Pittsboro, North Carolina.
Critical reception.
AllMusic wrote: "Part of the reason [the Zippers] stand apart from the rest of the neo-swing crowd is that they don't forget that there was a bit of menace in the days of hot jazz -- it wasn't a naive, swinging party, there was some genuine hedonism as well." "Entertainment Weekly"'s review called the band "adept but inconsequential," writing that Katharine Whalen's "sleepy Billie Holiday cadences verge on satire." "Spin" called the album "self-congratulatory, jokey, essentially heartless cartoon music masquerading as 1920s 'hot jazz'." The "Houston Press" deemed it "a dozen rock-solid originals that represent the band's finest and most ambitious collection to date."

Ziggy Sobotka

Chester Karol "Ziggy" Sobotka is a fictional character on the HBO drama "The Wire", played by actor James Ransone. Though his father Frank Sobotka was a well-respected stevedore union leader, Ziggy's thoughtless and immature behavior gained him little respect among other members of the union and The Greek's crime organization.
Biography.
Season 2.
Ziggy is Frank Sobotka's son and Nick's cousin. He is a Baltimore dock worker and is involved in his father's stevedores union, but is also involved in criminal activity. Like most of the dock workers, Ziggy frequents Delores' bar, where he amuses the other customers with his drunken antics, such as publicly exposing himself. His work on the docks is often poor, resulting in him regularly being fired and reinstated by his father. Due to his lack of seniority, Ziggy receives little work.
He is often portrayed as a clumsy and inept beneficiary of his father's position and is more interested in goofing off. He is close to Nick, who often bails him out when his various money-making schemes backfire. Despite his shortcomings, however, he has a better understanding of technology than many of his colleagues. He uses his computer research skills to assist Nick in his dealings with the Greeks.
When thirteen dead women are discovered in one of Sobotka's shipping containers, Ziggy is dealing drugs supplied by "White Mike" McArdle. He tries unsuccessfully to convince the more streetwise Nick to join him. He sells the drugs at street level using an East Baltimore dealer known as Frog. When Frog lies about being robbed and keeps the money, White Mike severs ties with Ziggy.
He turns to smuggling with his cousin, starting with a container of digital cameras. During a meeting with George "Double G" Glekas, a front man for an international smuggling operation, Ziggy's knowledge of the product helps to secure a better deal. However, when Glekas sees Ziggy taking pictures, he angrily smashes the camera. When Ziggy uses his share of the money to buy a new leather coat, Nick chastises him for flashing his newfound wealth. This also earns him the disdain of Maui.
Turning to a drug dealer named Cheese for a fresh supply, Ziggy finds himself ripped off again. Cheese's group steals his car, delivers a beating and threatens to kill him if he does not pay within a week. The debt is ultimately cancelled when Nick enlists the help of the Greeks, since they are shown to supply the entire operation. The two of them smuggle chemicals that the Greeks use to process cocaine. When offered payment in the form of drugs, Nick opts for cash instead to stop Ziggy from failing at another scheme (the Greeks, who are rightly impressed by Nick's criminal acumen, initially offered him the drugs because they knew he would be able to make a large profit from selling them). Ziggy accepts regular installments from Nick until he decides that his pride has been hurt too much and dramatically throws a pile of bills away in refusal.
After losing a fight with Maui, in response to a fake paternity suit prank, Ziggy buys a duck and takes it to Delores' bar. He feeds the duck too much alcohol and becomes upset when it dies. In an attempt to prove his smuggling skills, Ziggy begins stealing cars with Johnny Fifty. He announces this to Glekas, who reluctantly agrees to participate. Upon delivery, Glekas refuses to part with the agreed sum, sending Ziggy into a rage. He returns with a gun and kills Glekas with a barrage of gunshots. He also wounds a boy working in the warehouse.
Ziggy breaks down in tears when he comes to his senses and confesses to the police when they arrive. While being interviewed by Sergeant Jay Landsman at the Homicide division, he agrees to sign a murder confession Landsman had prepared based on Ziggy’s statements. Ziggy requests the document be changed to reflect that Double G “begged” for his life. Frank later visits Ziggy in jail and apologizes for not doing more to help his son. Ziggy tells Frank that the union had always come before him, harkening back towards the memories they had shared previously on the docks. Ziggy is convicted of the murder and is last seen walking to his cell in a prison, serving out his sentence.
Origins.
The actor who portrays Ziggy, James Ransone, is a Baltimore native and has described the character as representative of the difficulties people face just trying to get by in Baltimore. The character's creators have deemed him "the angry prince of goofs."
In an online interview, David Simon stated that Ziggy is loosely based on a real stevedore named Pinkie Bannion whose antics have become a local legend around the docks. According to Simon, Bannion "used to take his duck to the bar and repeatedly expose 'pretty boy' and all else. As they said in Bawlmer about Pinkie: 'That boy ain't right.'"

Short swing

A short swing rule restricts officers and insiders of a company from making short-term profits at the expense of the firm. It is part of United States federal securities law, and is a prophylactic measure intended to guard against so-called insider trading. The rule mandates that if an officer, director, or any shareholder holding more than 10% of outstanding shares of a publicly traded company makes a profit on a transaction with respect to the company's stock during a given six-month period, that officer, director, or shareholder must pay the difference back to the company. Note that the profit calculated is the maximum considering each pair of sales and purchases, a larger trade could be paired with trades up to six month prior as well as up to six months later and the correct calculation is a linear programming problem

Robert G. James

Robert Gillespie James (born June 19, 1946) is a senior United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, and was one of the judges involved in a 2006 water rights legal case, "Normal Parm v. Sheriff Mark Shumate".
Education and career.
Born in Ruston, Louisiana, James received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Louisiana Tech University in 1968 and a Juris Doctor from the Paul M. Hebert Law Center at Louisiana State University in 1971. He was in private practice in Ruston from 1971 to 1998, and was a business law instructor at Louisiana Tech University from 1992 to 1998. He was a judge on the Ruston City Court from 1985 to 1998.
Federal judicial service.
On January 27, 1998, James was nominated by President Bill Clinton to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana vacated by John Malach Shaw. James was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 31, 1998, and received his commission on August 3, 1998. He served as Chief Judge from 2009 to 2012. He assumed senior status on May 31, 2016.
Notable ruling.
On August 29, 2006, James overruled United States Magistrate Judge James D. Kirk, who wrote that Federal law "...entitles the public to the reasonable use of navigable waters for all legitimate purposes of travel or transportation, for boating, sailing for pleasure, as well as for carrying persons or property for hire, and in any kind of watercraft the use of which is consistent with others also enjoying the right possessed in common." The holding confirmed that it was criminal trespass for boaters to enter property above the ordinary high-water mark of riparian landowners to fish or hunt without permission. Strictly interpreting Federal law, James said that "the public has no 'right to fish and hunt on the Mississippi River.'" The original case was the result of the arrests of several anglers who were fishing in Mississippi River floodwaters, which had covered the private property of the Walker Cottonwood Farm. The case shows that the public trust rights associated with navigable waterways do not extend to "flooded" areas.

Targeting tower

Targeting towers use a special device to ensure an antenna's stability when strong wind blows.
This system is based on the geometrical properties of the parallelogram. Three vertical rods are used to maintain the top platform horizontal when the tower bends under the wind effect. The top platform is pin connected to the mast, thanks to a special mechanical link based on universal joint system. The system allows to reduce the size and the weight of the towers, because contrary to standard poles, stiffness is not needed.
In standard towers, the antenna beam's rotation must not exceed a certain angle (currently between 0.5° and 2°), otherwise the communication is cut. This design criterion is more severe than the resistance criteria and leads to use twice the steel quantity.
Targeting towers have been used for the first time in 2004 in Italy for high radar supporting poles.
Specific tests have been led on a tower-test platform in Livorno (Italy). The test used 2 cameras filming simultaneously a target meanwhile the pole was submitted to dynamic oscillations. One being fixed on the pole and the other on the top platform.

The Practical Pig

The Practical Pig is a "Silly Symphonies" animated short film produced by Walt Disney. It was released on February 24, 1939, and was directed by Dick Rickard. It was the fourth and final cartoon starring The Three Pigs. Like its predecessors, "The Practical Pig" incorporates the song "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?". Unlike its predecessors however, its title cards labeled it as a standalone "Three Little Pigs" cartoon, suggesting that they were to get their own series of cartoons. It is also the second-to-last "Silly Symphony" released.
Plot.
Practical Pig is hard at work building a new anti-wolf contraption, this time a lie detector. His two brothers, Fiddler and Fifer Pig decide to go swimming, despite Practical's warning about the Big Bad Wolf lurking by the pond. The Big Bad Wolf disguises as a mermaid to lure Fiddler and Fifer and captures them and bringing them to an old windmill where his sons the Three Little Wolves are waiting for their dinner, but tells them they must not eat until he captures Practical. The Wolf plans to entrap Practical as well using a fake letter requesting help by his brothers. While the wolf is off to capture Practical, the Three Little Wolves start early to put the two pigs into a pan and prepare to bake them into a pie. The Wolf, disguised as a messenger boy, blows his cover when he blows the fake letter under Practical's door. Realizing the wolf is up to his tricks and his brothers have been captured, Practical tries out his new invention. As the wolf attempts to lure Practical, the welcome mat opens under the wolf's feet, and the wolf falls into the pit below. He is next seen strapped in a chair in the basement, captured, as Practical demands to know his brothers' whereabouts. The wolf first he claims he has never heard of Practical's brothers and secondly he claims he hasn't seen them, but the lie detector detects his lies and punishes the wolf with brushes to wash his mouth out with soap and spank him in each case. The wolf then lastly tries to fool the machine by claiming that he and Practical are pals, but the lie detector sees through this and gives him the works (a spanking and a mouth washing, along with his knuckles being whacked with rulers, all at once).
Back at the wolves' hideout, the Three Little Wolves are about to bake Fifer and Fiddler into the oven as the two pigs tell them they'll be sorry when their father comes home. One of the wolf cubs uses pepper but the lid accidentally comes off and this causes the two pigs to sneeze so strong, the pie crust is duffed off and into the wolves splatting and trapping them against a wall. With the wolf cubs trapped, Fiddler and Fifer escape and rush back to Practical's house.
The lie detector punishes the Wolf harder and harder until he finally tells the truth, saying "They're in the old... the old mill". He is then shot out of the house with a firecracker and seemingly explodes in the sky. Practical prepares to go save his brothers when Fiddler and Fifer burst in. When Practical scolds them for defying his warning, they tell him that they didn't go swimming, at which point the lie detector springs into action, flipping them over, dropping their shorts, and gives them a spanking. When Practical tells his brothers "Remember, this hurts me worse than it does you!", the lie detector ends up interpreting what he just said as a lie and gives him a spanking as well, much to his chagrin at iris out.
Comic adaptation.
The "Silly Symphony" Sunday comic strip ran a three-month-long adaptation of "The Practical Pig" from May 1 to August 7, 1938.
Reception.
"The Film Daily" wrote: "The musical effects here heighten the comedy to howling proportions... While lacking a hit tune, this edition of the Three Pigs is a delightful bit of nonsense."
Home media.
The short was released on December 4, 2001, on "", as an easter egg in the options menu of Disc 1. It has also been released as a bonus feature on the British VHS edition of "Dumbo".

Frank Sobotka

Francis "Frank" Sobotka is a fictional character in of the HBO drama "The Wire", played by the actor Chris Bauer.
Plot.
Frank is a respected Polish-American treasurer for the International Brotherhood of Stevedores at the Baltimore docks. As the "pater familias" for the docks' longshoremen population, he manages the finances of the labor union and ensures that workers are taken care of—a task made harder by the decline of the local shipping industry and lack of available hours.
In Episode 6, Sobotka lobbies the Maryland state government to promote more employment at the Baltimore shipyards through grants to improve the port. Yet the power of the International Brotherhood of Stevedores (IBS), Sobotka's union, was already diminished. With union membership down, the IBS collaborated with smugglers to offset some of its lost revenue. 
Desperate to return prosperity to the docks, he begins making overtures to lobbyists and politicians to support initiatives that will make the port a more attractive shipping location. His two main objectives are to have the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal dredged to increase the depth for incoming ships and to re-open the grain pier. Bruce DiBiago, a lobbyist, serves as a go-between for Sobotka and politicians such as State Senator Clay Davis.
To obtain the necessary funds for paying the bribes, Sobotka arranges with European gangsters "The Greek" and Spiros "Vondas" Vondopoulos to smuggle goods through the port. Ships with contraband such as drugs and human trafficking victims for the purpose of sexual slavery will be tagged by Frank's union cohort Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa, with the crates disappearing in the computer system and driven out by the Greek's man Sergei "Serge" Malatov. Frank's nephew Nick Sobotka, another union member, acts as a go-between for his uncle and Vondas by passing messages and delivering lists of containers to be moved. Unbeknownst to Frank, his troubled son, Chester "Ziggy" Sobotka, often accompanies Nick to these meetings.
Frank's criminal activities begin to be suspected by the police following a feud with Major Stan Valchek, district commander for the Baltimore Police Department's Southeast District, whose gift of a stained glass window to a local church has been eclipsed by Sobotka's more elaborate window (a move to have the priest get Frank closer to a senator in his congregation). Suspicious of how a dockworker could have so much disposable income, Valchek persuades Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell to assemble a detail to investigate Sobotka's activities.
The investigation gains further traction with the discovery of thirteen dead girls in a shipping container ("can"), who turn out to be human trafficking victims for the purpose of sexual slavery smuggled in by The Greek and who were killed by the sailors shipping them in for witnessing the death of one of their colleagues (whose body had earlier been tossed overboard and was picked up by Jimmy McNulty).
Frank is enraged that human trafficking is taking place in his port. He confronts Vondas, asking why he wasn't informed about it so that he could have taken extra precautions. Vondas points out that Frank said he did not want to know what the Greeks were smuggling into the country (to distance himself from further criminal liability). Frank says that if anything is breathing inside a container, he needs to know about it.
With detectives asking questions about the dead girls, some strange goings-on with his cell phone, and his suspicions about his friend Officer Beadie Russell's involvement in the case, Frank becomes increasingly nervous. He demands to meet The Greek and tells him he wants out. The Greek, who needs Frank's system, objects. Nick then asks for more money so they can take on the extra risk. The Greek and Frank agree to this arrangement, but Frank is ever more uneasy, and his world unravels.
Towards the end of the season, Frank is arrested on smuggling charges after the detail is pressured into making arrests. Valchek personally escorts a compliant Frank out of the union hall in handcuffs, and the resulting media attention leads lawmakers to cut their ties. With his efforts to save the port sunk, and with Ziggy arrested for murdering a fence and Nick wanted for selling drugs, Sobotka decides to accept Russell's advice and turn informant on The Greek.
Before passing information to the police, The Greek arranges for a meeting in which Frank will be offered to have a state's witness change their story at Ziggy's trial in exchange for Frank's silence. However, The Greek is tipped off by his inside man in the FBI that Frank is about to turn informant. Frank is last seen alive, walking resolutely beneath a bridge to the rendezvous with The Greek in a final effort to save his son.
Frank's body is found in the harbor the following day, with multiple stab wounds and his throat cut. Detectives remark that numerous defensive wounds indicate he died fighting. After his death, his fellow dockworkers, in tribute to Frank, re-elect him as treasurer in defiance of federal warnings, which leads to the dissolution of his local union office.
Miscellaneous.
A picture of former Baltimore Colts owner Robert Irsay is pinned on Frank Sobotka's dartboard. Irsay moved the Colts from Baltimore to Indianapolis in 1984. As a result, he is one of the most hated figures in Baltimore.

Nick Sobotka

Nicholas Andrew Sobotka is a fictional character on the HBO drama "The Wire", played by actor Pablo Schreiber. Nick is the cousin of Ziggy Sobotka, the wayward and rebellious son of Nick's uncle Frank Sobotka.
Plot details.
Season 2.
Nick is a dockworker in the Port of Baltimore, and works for his uncle Frank Sobotka, the secretary treasurer for a stevedores union. He often has to keep his cousin (and Frank's son) Ziggy out of trouble, something his uncle appreciates. Despite Nick's disdain for Ziggy's antics, Nick shows considerable patience and genuinely cares about Ziggy.
Involved in his uncle's smuggling operation, Nick often serves as Frank's go-between in meetings with Spiros "Vondas" Vondopoulos. At the diner Vondas uses as an office, Nick acquires the serial numbers of cargo containers being smuggled in by The Greek.
Nick has a girlfriend, Aimee, with whom he has a daughter, Ashley. They want to move in together, but are unable to afford a place of their own. The fact that Nick lives with his parents and lacks a steady income leads to tension between the two. Since Nick is one of the younger stevedores, seniority prevents him from getting enough work at the docks.
Desperate for cash, he and Ziggy steal a trailer full of cameras and sell it to the Greek's front man, Glekas. This brings Nick to the attention of Vondas, who asks for large quantities of chemicals. Nick accepts this job after learning that the chemicals are used in the processing of drugs instead of bombs.
Nick enters the drug trade to help relieve Ziggy from the debt he owes to Proposition Joe's nephew Cheese. Cheese cooperates when Nick arrives with Sergei "Serge" Malatov to threaten him at gunpoint. Later, Nick sells heroin to a drug dealer named Frog after receiving it as payment from Vondas. Nick begins dealing with "White" Mike McArdle in order to continue supplying Frog.
Nick is distraught when Ziggy is arrested for killing Glekas. Knowing that Ziggy's stature and temperament make him ill-suited for prison, Nick descends into a drunken depression and tearfully laments the circumstances that landed Ziggy behind bars. Eventually, police obtain a warrant for Nick's arrest. His parents are aghast to see Nick's stash of money and drugs when their house is raided.
Knowing about Ziggy's case, the Greeks make an offer of witness intimidation in hopes of buying Frank's silence. Nick relays this offer, prompting Frank to arrange a meeting with the Greeks alone. From their mole in the FBI, the Greeks learn that Frank had previously told the police he intended to co-operate and kill him once he arrives. Grieving over his uncle's death, Nick turns himself in to the police in order to testify and help them identify the Greek for the first time.
At the end of season two, Nick, Aimee and Ashley enter federal witness protection. In the last scene, he sheds a tear looking at the decaying shipping shoreline, symbolizing the death of blue-collar work in American industry.
Season 5.
Nick makes a brief appearance in season five, heckling Mayor Tommy Carcetti’s ribbon-cutting ceremony for the conversion of a derelict grain pier into condos and waterfront commercial space, contrary to what his uncle Frank had hoped. This, together with the appearance of Johnny Fifty in a homeless encampment earlier in the season, suggests that the port has been continuing job cuts since season two. No information about Nick's life is provided, although Simon has since said that Nick left the witness protection program after missing his friends and family.

<doc id="7017859" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7017859" title="KGAB">
KGAB

KGAB (650 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a News Talk Information format. It is licensed to Orchard Valley, Wyoming, and serves the Cheyenne, Wyoming, area and operates with daytime power of 8,500 watts. The station is owned and operated by Townsquare Media.
Signal.
Day.
During daylight hours, KGAB operates a non-directional signal of 8.5 kw using one tower on Terry Ranch Road which provides a local coverage to all of Laramie County, as well as the city of Laramie, and the Fort Collins-Greeley-Loveland area. A decent signal is available to the Denver area, as well as a decent swath of Southeast and Central Wyoming including Casper, while a barely readable signal reaches Colorado Springs. The daytime signal has been reported in Salt Lake City and in Missouri.
Night.
The station does not adjust its power during sunrise and sunset, therefore allowing a window where the station extends its coverage dramatically. 
At night, class-B KGAB is required to drop their signal to 500 watts, which points directionally north-west to protect clear-channels WSM Nashville, Tennessee and KENI Anchorage, Alaska. This provides a local signal to Cheyenne and Laramie, and can provide a skywave signal to Casper and even Billings. The nighttime signal has reportedly been received as far as Finland at night.
Translator.
In order to serve a younger audience, KGAB began testing a broadcast translator on 99.5 FM in July 2021, at the tower site of sister-station KIGN, as part of AM revitalization; it operated with 250 watts non-directional ERP.
Around mid-August, the signal was again off the air due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing backlogs for the construction company involved; as a result, the translator will instead use an old antenna at the same site, and it will be directionalized towards Cheyenne. When the translator (K258DN) was on the first time around, it faced massive interference from both KQMT in Denver, as well as excessive overlap from a transmitter in downtown Cheyenne. On September 7, 2021, the new antenna system was approved for the translator, and the license to cover was granted. The station officially returned to the air on October 12, using the new antenna and contour.
Under the old set-up, the translator produced a strong local-grade signal to much of Cheyenne, despite the aforementioned interference, and it could be heard up to Burns and Pine Bluffs. The west side of Cheyenne, particularly near I-180, reception proved to be difficult for most listeners, due to overlapping interference from a tower on 15th street not having their bandwidth adjusted properly. Under the new construction permit, the KGAB translator will provide a good signal to the city of Cheyenne, to hopefully prevent interference. However, it will throw a severe null to its east, preventing most listening this way. Officially, the city of license, Orchard Valley, is the same as KGAB's COL; however, the tower itself is closer to Altvan, Wyoming.
History.
The station was assigned the call sign KVWO on June 9, 1978, which moved to a low-power station in Welch, Oklahoma
On October 11, 1979, the station changed its call sign to KUUY and on December 9, 1996, to KMRZ. On March 21, 1997, the station became the current KGAB.
There is evidence that KGAB operated at 8,600 watts at times as opposed to the licensed 8,500 during the early 21st century.
Programming.
On Weekdays, most shows are nationally syndicated, and conservatively leaning, including Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Dave Ramsey III (a financial analyst), Ken Coleman, Michael Savage, Ben Shapiro, and Coast To Coast AM with George Noory. The early morning timeslot offers a regionally syndicated program called "Wake Up Wyoming w/Glenn Woods", as well as the national "This Morning w/Mark Deal".
Upon the passing of Rush Limbaugh, guest hosts narrated past episodes of the show, in his honor; Premiere networks eventually chose Dan Bongino as the replacement for the timeslot
On Saturdays, KGAB presents several hours worth of local programming, including "Kar-Gab", featuring "Nick the Motor Guy", described as an escaped Englishman, and "This Weekend in Wyoming" with Doug Randall, a local anchor. The afternoon line-up features Joe Pags, while the evening line-up again includes Dave Ramsey and George Noory.
On Sundays, KGAB switches back to hosting nationally syndicated broadcasts, including Hannity at an earlier time, as well as the Dave Ramsey show (although the Sunday edition is hosted by Anthony O'Neil so he can produce his show for nearby KOA. In addition, Bill Cunningham runs the 10pm time-slot.
News updates are provided either by Fox News, or by the local staff, mainly Doug Randall and Joy Greenwald, and appear at the top and bottom of each hour. Weather is also provided during these times, often provided by Cheyenne based "Day-Weather".
As of 2021, KGAB clears the entire Buffalo Bills football schedule, as a result of former Wyoming quarterback Josh Allen having moved to the Bills.
KGAB in popular culture.
The Oliver Stone movie "Talk Radio" takes place at a fictional radio station called KGAB, located in Dallas, Texas. The movie was made in 1988, and as KGAB's current call sign only dates back to 1997, it is unknown if the name was taken from the movie.
In "The A-Team" episode "Cowboy George", originally aired February 11, 1986, and guest-starring Boy George, KGAB was a top-40 country and western station serving Mono County and Twin Rivers, Arizona.

Spiros Vondas

Spiros "Vondas" Vondopoulos (Greek: Σπύρος Βονδόπουλος) is a fictional character on the HBO drama "The Wire" played by actor Paul Ben-Victor and the secondary antagonist in season 2.
Biography.
Vondas is The Greek's second-in-command and acts as a buffer between The Greek and his illegal activities, using a small cafe as his base of operations. Vondas tells Nick Sobotka that he has "many names, many passports." Vondas' actual name and nationality are unknown; his main alias is Greek in origin, but he laughs to his superior that his name is not really his name.
The name Spiros Vondopoulos is one of a range of identities that he has available to him. For example, he holds Hungarian and Croatian passports, but it is unclear if he is really a citizen of these countries. He is later shown destroying his Hungarian passport during a meal with The Greek. Vondas' Hungarian identity is Janos Kovats from Budapest, and his Croatian identity is Kirko Skaddeng, who is ostensibly a medical assistant from Osijek.
Vondas is almost always seen wearing a newsboy cap and has a strong fashion sense, as when Bunk Moreland observes that Vondas is wearing a Joseph Abboud blazer in the Season 2 episode "Bad Dreams".
Season 2.
Vondas manages all aspects of the Greek's illicit shipping business but keeps a low, surveillance-conscious profile. He is Frank Sobotka's point of contact for his smuggling with The Greek. Vondas is even-tempered and patient, and often soothes the increasingly angry and frightened Sobotka as the Baltimore police began a serious investigation into Sobotka's union. Vondas also handles much less savory tasks: e.g., when a sailor in the Greek's employ, Sam, murdered fourteen girls meant for work as prostitutes, Vondas killed the man after the Greek interrogated him.
Vondas manages the Greek's drug dealing through their Israeli lieutenant Eton Ben-Eleazer. Vondas' own personnel involved in the smuggling operation include driver and enforcer Sergei "Serge" Malatov and organization fence George "Double G" Glekas.
Vondas often meets with Nick Sobotka, who frequently serves as Frank's go-between, and Vondas takes an almost paternal interest in the younger man. Impressed with Nick's intelligence, Vondas gave him the task of stealing a shipment of chemicals. Vondas also intervenes in a dispute over a debt between Nick's cousin Ziggy Sobotka and a drug dealer supplied by the Greek, Cheese Wagstaff.
Vondas often acts as the voice of reason in the Greeks inner circle as he proposes to deal with the Columbians who bought the chemicals from them but only paid 40% during the deal. His suggestion to help "their friend" within the FBI as a way of paying pack a favor is meet positively by the Greek who alludes that many of the actions carried out in Columbia could be of great interest to the FBI and the Anti - Terrorist Division. This results in "their friend" Agent Koutris seizing a shipment of cocaine from the Columbians going through the port disguised as other materials. 
Despite a personal dislike for Ziggy, Vondas orders Sergei to argue Ziggy's case to Proposition Joe, Cheese's uncle and superior. Vondas' distrust of Ziggy proves correct when Ziggy kills Glekas in an argument over payment for stolen cars. Ziggy is arrested soon afterward, and Vondas distances the murder from the rest of the operation by removing all evidence of the business from the warehouse.
When Lieutenant Daniels's port detail begins investigating the Greek's activity, Frank Sobotka realizes what is happening and tips Vondas. During the finale, the investigation detail finally gets a photo of Spiros meeting with his drug lieutenant Eton on the Baltimore waterfront. The detail then surveils Vondas' home and follows him to meetings at hotel rooms and the diner where he meets with associates.
The Greek orders Vondas to shut down the smuggling operation temporarily and replace all of his personnel's telephones. The Greek also withdraws from their meeting place at the cafe and begins meeting Vondas in hotel rooms.
When the detail begins rounding up members of the Greek's smuggling ring, they hold off on Vondas, hoping he can lead them to the Greek. When Sobotka is arrested, Vondas suggests that they could broker his loyalty by having a witness against Ziggy change his story. Vondas puts the proposition to Frank through Nick. Frank has already agreed to testify against the Greek's crew but decides to meet with them for Ziggy's sake. The Greek learns of Frank's agreement through his inside man at the FBI, agent Koutris, and has Vondas murder Frank.
Following the murder, the Greek and Vondas leave the country; Vondas uses a fake Croatian passport with the alias Kirko Skaddeng. Before Vondas leaves, he meets with Proposition Joe to assure him that the Greek's operation will continue to supply him, using new personnel, after a short break to avoid the investigation.
Season 4.
After Omar Little's team steals a shipment from the Greek to Proposition Joe's New Day Co-Op, Joe sets up a meeting with Vondas and Marlo Stanfield in order to assuage Marlo's suspicions that Joe had set him up in order to make him pay twice for the same shipment. It is thus revealed that Vondas had returned to Baltimore some time after the Major Crimes investigation of the docks had ended, and that Vondas had resumed his working relationship with Proposition Joe. While Marlo is satisfied with Vondas' explanation, he places a tail on him in order to learn more about Vondas' role in importing the drugs into Baltimore.
Season 5.
Once the Major Crimes investigation into his organization is shut down, Marlo Stanfield feels secure enough in making a move to establish a direct relationship with Vondas and the Greeks. He researches the port case and discovers that former Greek soldier Sergei Malatov is incarcerated at Jessup. After paying prison gang leader Avon Barksdale to gain access to Sergei, Marlo uses Sergei to locate the Greeks' diner headquarters and drops off a large sum of money in order to persuade Vondas to grant him a meeting.
Vondas is displeased that Marlo has brought him dirty money, from the street, and insists that all business should continue to go through Joe, then sends Marlo on his way. Marlo quickly has Joe clean his cash, and he drops off the fresh money at the diner, telling Vondas' man that he didn't mean for there to be any misunderstanding.
Marlo once again meets with Vondas and attempts to sell himself as an insurance policy for the Greeks, implying that if anything were to happen to Proposition Joe, they would need another agent they could do business with. While Vondas believes all that matters is that the Greeks already have a secure relationship with someone they trust, The Greek states that Marlo makes a valid point that it is wise to have an insurance policy in volatile times, implicitly telling Marlo that if he moves on Joe, they will not stop him.
After Marlo leaves, Vondas and the Greek seem resigned to Joe's demise and to initiating a new business relationship with Marlo, believing that Joe's time has come, and that Marlo's tenacity and ambition will not allow him to accept the Greeks' rejection of his business overtures.
After Marlo has Proposition Joe murdered, he receives Vondas' blessing to be Joe's replacement as agent between Vondas' drug shipments and the New Day Co-op's drug distribution activities.
Later, Marlo's first re-supply with the Greeks is busted by the Major Crimes Unit, and as part of a deal with the State's Attorney's office, Marlo is forced to retire from his life of crime. To set himself up for life, Marlo sells the connection to the Greeks to whoever can pay him 10 million dollars. In the series finale, Vondas is seen meeting with Fat Face Rick and Slim Charles at Little Johnny's Diner. They are discussing the new business arrangement, while The Greek quietly listens in the background.

Neshamah (album)

Neshamah (Songs from the Jewish Diaspora) is the first solo recording by American guitarist Tim Sparks on the Tzadik Records label. "Neshamah" means "soul" in Hebrew. The arrangements adapt Ashkenazic klezmer, Sephardic and Middle Eastern Jewish music for the solo guitar.
History.
Sparks had sent a copy of his earlier CD "Guitar Bazaar" to avant-garde composer, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist John Zorn who liked the Bartok "Rumanian Dances" arrangements on that CD. Sparks had previously played a lot of Jewish music with various Jewish musicians and became adept in the Klezmer style. Zorn suggested the solo guitar adaptations of traditional Jewish songs. Sparks blended the songs with his background in jazz, Latin American, Balkan and American roots music.
Reception.
In his Allmusic review, music critic Steven Lowey praised "Neshamah" writing "Sometimes the guitar transforms a piece into something different than it was originally... [Sparks] squeezes every ounce of melodic sophistication from a song's essence, resulting in a delightful and authentic display that while impressive is never overdone." In his review for "Dirty Linen" magazine, Jim Lee wrote "A truly groundbreaking project and one that also makes for refreshing listening. I'd recommend both to any fan of good music, be it guitar or otherwise." Critic Aaron Howard also praised the album, "The result is brilliant on many levels. Musically, Sparks is one of the better guitarists in the country, a musician's musician even if he remains largely unknown to a large audience. Think of Bill Frisell, Leo Kottke or Adrian Legg and that's the level that Sparks plays on."

The Greek

The Greek is a fictional character on the HBO drama "The Wire", played by actor Bill Raymond. The Greek is the head of an international smuggling organization, including narcotics and human trafficking. The Greek is a mysterious figure involved in numerous criminal activities. His given name is never mentioned on the show and he is known only as the Greek, although he stated that he is not actually Greek.
A quiet and unassuming man, the Greek prefers to keep a low profile, operating all of his business through his lieutenant Spiros "Vondas" Vondopoulos. His smuggling organization operated from a small diner in Baltimore for years, and while Vondas would conduct business the Greek would listen in quietly at the counter. Nick Sobotka, upon seeing the Greek identify himself, was amazed that the shadowy figure had been in plain sight the entire time. He serves as the primary antagonist of the second season. 
Despite his calm demeanor, the Greek is cunning and ruthless, and only interested in facts that make him more money. Series creator David Simon has said that the Greek is an embodiment of raw unencumbered capitalism. Anyone interfering in this process is eliminated immediately, and he prefers to leave victims headless and handless to hinder identification. His smuggling operation includes importing sex trade workers, illicit drugs, stolen goods and chemicals for drug processing. He bribes union stevedores to move containers through the Baltimore port for him and uses his enforcer, Sergei "Serge" Malatov, to run containers back and forth from the port to his warehouse, a front managed by "Double G" Glekas.
The Greek supplies the major drug dealers in East Baltimore with pure heroin, using Eton Ben-Eleazer to move his drugs. His chief client is Proposition Joe, but he is also affiliated with smaller drug dealing organizations like those run by "White Mike" McArdle. His sex trade interests in Baltimore include a brothel run by a madam named Ilona Petrovna, bringing in girls from eastern Europe. He manages to avoid prosecution for his crimes because an FBI counter-terrorism agent named Kristos Koutris tips him off if a criminal investigation gets too close. It is suggested the Greek and Vondas may serve as federal informants.
Biography.
Season two.
The Greek begins to draw police attention in Highlandtown, Baltimore when his contact at the docks, Frank Sobotka, becomes the target of an investigation. At the same time a container of thirteen dead young women intended for the sex trade is discovered at the docks, triggering a high-profile homicide investigation. The container belongs to the Greek; the women were killed by a crewman on board the vessel that had delivered them.
The ship's crew were paying the women for sex and when one of the girls refused, she was killed. The crewman responsible dumped her overboard (her body later being picked up by Jimmy McNulty and Claude Diggins) and collapsed the air pipe on the container to kill the remaining women by stifling them. The Greek has Sergei track the crewman down, interrogates him personally, and has Vondas kill him. 
As the investigation continues, the police link Eton and Sergei to the drug smuggling operation. When police begin tracking containers as they leave the port, the Greek and Vondas close down the operation temporarily by dumping their cell phones and stealing "clean" containers. Persuading Sobotka to keep the smuggling operation going, the Greek buys further protection from Agent Koutris by betraying a load of Colombian cocaine, giving him time to destroy incriminating evidence in the warehouse and Glekas' store. 
The Greek recognizes that the investigation is too extensive to stop and plans to leave, sending Vondas to assure Proposition Joe that supply of drugs would continue albeit with new faces. He attempts to buy Sobotka's silence with promised legal aid for his son, but when he learned from Koutris that Frank was planning to turn informant he had the union man killed. Frank’s nephew Nick Sobotka is considered to be a threat to the Greek’s organization briefly, before Vondas and the Greek decide he knows too little about their actual identities to be sure. Nick identifies the Greek in a photo and Sergei is pressured to give up the location of his hotel suite, Vondas and the Greek have already boarded a flight to Chicago. Aware that the Greek and Vondas are gone, the police leave the investigation behind and move on to the drug dealers he supplied.
Seasons four and five.
The Greek continues to supply "Proposition Joe" Stewart, who forms an organization with other drug dealers, the New Day Co-Op, to provide the Greek's product to them in exchange for reduced violence and sharing of territory. When Omar Little steals an entire shipment of heroin from the Greek's men as it is being delivered to Stewart's people, Marlo Stanfield demands a meeting with Spiros "Vondas" Vondopoulos in order to allay his fears that Stewart was responsible. Once Stanfield is satisfied, he waits for the Major Crimes Unit's investigation into his activities to cease and then moves to establish a direct relationship with Vondas and the Greek, after getting in communication with Vondas through former soldier Sergei.
Marlo eventually sells himself as Joe's replacement by convincing the Greek that he requires an insurance policy in the form of a replacement for Proposition Joe, in the event that anything should happen to him. Realizing that Stanfield will move against Stewart regardless of his approval, the Greek accepts Marlo's proposal to act as an "insurance policy," knowing that it will mean Joe's death. While the Greek and Vondas make peace with this development they still sadly acknowledge that Stanfield is "not joe" as Proposition Joe was a steady partner which they could rely and had business with for years. 
After Stewart's murder, Stanfield meets with Vondas to initiate their new business relationship. Stanfield's tenure proves short lived when he is forced into retirement by an investigation, and the other Co-Op members purchase the connection from Stanfield. In the closing montage of the series finale, Slim Charles and Fat-Face Rick take over meeting with Vondas while the Greek listens quietly in the background.

Mendota (Bete Grise) Light

The Mendota Light, also known as the Bete Grise light, was built on the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan to facilitate travel between Lake Superior and Lac La Belle (an artificial canal having been made to connect the two).
History.
The original plans were laid in 1867 and the lighthouse was constructed in 1869. Only one year later, the light was decommissioned as it was found by navigators to be of no assistance (nor was there any other commercial reason to make this trip).
The tower was removed and taken to Marquette, but the keeper's house remained in place. In 1892, ships tried to use this bay for a safe harbor during a storm, and the seafarers, observing the house (at this point deserted), suggested that the harbor would be easier to find if there was a light present. By 1895, funds had been allocated to re-establish the light, but it was determined that the existing structure had deteriorated so much that it could not be used. A new structure was built using the original foundations.
In 1933 the light was automated and in 1956 it was decommissioned.
It was a private residence until 1996. The lighthouse, only accessible by boat since no roads or private drives lead to it, was for sale in 1996. It was sold to a person willing to conserve the light. The original fourth order Fresnel lens was found, restored and in 1998 relit. It is still in place and in use. Efforts are being made to maintain the light for the "next 100 years".
The light is now classified as an active private aid to navigation.
To view the light, travel to the Keweenaw Peninsula of Upper Michigan to the town of Bete Grise. The road ends at the Mendota Ship Canal. Take the short walk to the Ship Canal. You will see the station boathouse across the Canal, and the Mendota Light itself a little to the east.

The Bold Knight, the Apples of Youth, and the Water of Life

"The Bold Knight, the Apples of Youth, and the Water of Life" () is a Russian fairy tale collected by Alexander Afanasyev in "Narodnye russkie skazki". The tale and is variants are numbered 171-178 in the first volume of the three-volume collection.
Synopsis.
An old king whose sight was failing heard of a garden with apples that would make a man grow young, and water that would restore his sight. His oldest son set out and came to a pillar with different directions: on one road, his horse would be full and its rider be hungry; on the second, the youth would lose his life, and on the third, he would be full and his horse hungry. He took the third road and came to a house where a widow made him welcome. The old dame also offered to let him spend the night with her daughter Dunia. The prince accepted, but Dunia made him fall into the cellar.
The king’s second son set out and met the same fate. Finally the king’s youngest son set out, over his father's reluctance. When the boy received the same offer from the widow, he said he must go to the bathhouse first; Dunia led him to it, and he beat her until she revealed his brothers. The youngest prince freed them, but they were ashamed to go home.
Returning to his quest, the third prince rode on and found a pretty maiden weaving. She could not direct him to the fabled garden, but instead sent him on to her second sister. The second sister bade him leave his horse with her and go on a two-winged horse to their third sister. The third sister gave him a four-winged horse and told him to ensure that it leapt the wall of the garden in a single bound, or it would make bells ring and wake the witch guarding it. He tried to obey her, but the horse's hoof just grazed the wall. The sound was too soft to wake the witch. In the morning, the witch chased after him on her six-winged horse, but only caught him when he was near his own land and did not fear her. She cursed the prince, saying nothing would save him from his brothers.
The third prince found his brothers sleeping and slept by them but they stole his apples and threw him over a cliff. He fell to a dark kingdom. There, a dragon demanded a beautiful maiden every year, and this year the lot had fallen on the kingdom’s princess. The knight said he would save the princess if the king would promise to do as the youth asked; the king promised not only that but to marry him to the princess as well. They went to where the dragon was coming and he went to sleep, telling the princess to wake him. The dragon came, she could not wake the prince and began to weep, and a tear fell on his face, waking him. The youth cut off the dragon's heads, put them under a rock, and threw its body in the sea.
Another man sneaked up behind him and cut off the third prince’s head. The assassin threatened to kill the princess if she would not say that he had killed the dragon. The king arranged for the marriage, but the princess went to sea with fishermen. Each time they caught a fish, she had them throw it back, but finally, their nets caught the third prince's body and head. She put them back together and used the water of life on them. The prince comforted her and sent her home, saying he would come and make it right. He came and asked the king whether the alleged dragon slayer could find the dragon's heads. The imposter could not, but the prince could. The prince said he wanted only to go to his own country, not to marry the princess, but she did not want to be parted from him. She knew a spoonbilled bird that could carry them, if it had enough to eat. They went off with a whole ox, but it was not quite enough; the princess cut off part of her thigh to feed it. The bird carried them all the way and commented on the sweetness of the last piece of meat. She showed it what she had done, and it spat the piece back out; the prince used the water of life to restore it.
The third prince went back with his father, used the water of life, and told him what his two brothers had done. The brothers were so frightened they jumped in the river. The knight married the princess.
Origin.
Folklorist Alexander Afanasyev published the tale, numbered 27, in the second tome of this multi-part collection in eight volumes.
Analysis.
Tale type.
Soon after he developed his classification of folktales, Finnish folklorist Antti Aarne published, in 1912, a study on the collections of the Brothers Grimm, Austrian consul Johann Georg von Hahn, Danish folklorist Svend Grundtvig, Swiss scholar Laura Gonzenbach and Afanasyev. According to this primary system, developed in 1910, the tale fits types 551, "The Water of Life" ("Sons on a quest for the Wonderful Remedy for their Father") and 300, "The Dragon-Slayer". Professor Regina Bendix also classifies the tale as type ATU 551. In Russian scholarship, the international tale type 551 is known as "Молодильные яблоки" ("Apples of Youth"), since in most of the variants the quest object are apples that restore youth and vitality to the ailing king, which is also the name of tale type SUS 551, of the East Slavic Folktale Classification ().
Motifs.
In regards to the journey on the bird's back (usually an eagle, but in this tale a spoonbill bird), folklorist scholarship recognizes its similarities with the tale of Etana helping an eagle, a tale type later classified as Aarne–Thompson–Uther ATU 537, "The Eagle as helper: hero carried on the wings of a helpful eagle".
Historical linguist Václav Blažek argues for parallels of certain motifs (the water of life, the golden apples) to Ossetian Nart sagas and the Greek myth of the Garden of the Hesperides.
Variants.
Russia.
Alexander Afanasyev collected eight variants in his original compilation of Russian folk tales, under the banner "Сказка о молодце-удальце, молодильных яблоках и живой воде" ("Tale of The Brave Youth, the Rejuvenating Apples and the Water of Life"). In some of the variants, the king dreams that there exists a maiden of exceptional beauty that lives near the fountain that grants youth or to the garden with a tree that grows the golden apples.
Professor Jack V. Haney also translated a variant from a Pomor storyteller named P. Ia. Nikonov. In this untitled tale, "clearly of the 'Rejuvenating Apples' type", the prince searches for "the living water, the rejuvenating apples, and the fire bird".
Balkans.
In a Balkanic variant, sourced as Macedonian, "The Story of the Prince and the Eagle", a king is dying and sends his three sons to hunt a male hare as a cure. The youngest hunts three hares, to his brothers' envy. They conspire to kill him: while drinking water from a well, they grab him by the legs and drop him down the well. The princes return to the king with the hares and lie that a band of robbers kill the prince. In reality, the youth has been falling for three years inside the well, until the fall stops when he reaches the ground. He notices he is in "the Nether World" and sees a light in the distance. He arrives at an old woman's hut, and she tells him of a terrible monster, a Lamia, with four legs and three heads, that demanded the sacrifice of a maiden every month, and this time it is her daughter, Maruda. The prince from the Upper World promises to kill the Lamia and rescue Maruda. He does, but the king and his council are not to happy about it. Maruda's mother warns them they must escape the Nether World, and suggests they take her giant golden eagle her late husband left her. They kill a giant she-buffalo to feed her, and the prince even sacrifices part of his flesh to feed the eagle so that they arrive safely at the Upper World.

06/05

06/05, called May 6th in most English-speaking countries, is a Dutch 2004 film directed by Theo van Gogh, based on the novel "De Zesde Mei" by Tomas Ross.
The film is a fictional version of the events that led to the assassination of the Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn on 6 May 2002. The lines between reality and fiction are blurred in "06/05". It is the last film of Theo van Gogh, who was himself assassinated in 2004.
Theo van Gogh struck a deal with Dutch internet provider Tiscali over the film's finances. The movie was originally released in December 2004 on the internet, a situation that had never before been seen in the Netherlands; it could be watched via pay-on-demand. It was released in cinemas one month later, in January 2005.

Bedlam Ballroom

Bedlam Ballroom is a studio album by the swing revival band Squirrel Nut Zippers, released in 2000. Following the departures of founding members Tom Maxwell and Ken Mosher, the lineup was adjusted to add piano and keyboard players Reese Gray and David Wright and saxophonist Tim Smith to the band, while bandleader Jimbo Mathus assumed the role of sole songwriter and performed all of the guitars alongside producer/engineer Mike Napolitano (who had worked with the group since their 1996 release "Hot"). The album reflects a stylistic shift, with the band incorporating a broader ranges of styles, instrumentation, and production approaches. The band broke up after the release of the album, eventually reuniting in 2007.
The album peaked at No. 195 on the "Billboard" 200.
Critical reception.
"Exclaim!" wrote that the band have "abandoned their adherence to '30s recording techniques, and though a bit of the charm is lost, thankfully these Zippers ain't slick." "CMJ New Music Monthly" wrote that the album finds SNZ "nearly as eclectic as ever, but more generic too." "Variety" thought that the album "can easily be considered their best for, if nothing else, they reclaim a time when music was unsure of itself, an era when Louis Armstrong had given up on the music of his youth to build a wider audience through pop numbers and show tunes."

WSPQ

WSPQ (1330 AM) was a radio station licensed to Springville, New York. WSPQ served the Southtowns region of Western New York from 1986 to 2017, when the station went off the air. The license was cancelled by the Federal Communications Commission on August 27, 2019.
History.
Full Service Radio.
The station signed on the air on May 8, 1986. WSPQ originally carried a full-service format. Throughout its existence it served as an affiliate for the Buffalo Bills Radio Network and carried local high school sports as well. Fred Haier served as the station's long-running morning host, hosting Tradio and a weekly classic country show as well. Howard Boundy, who began at the station playing novelty songs, served as a board operator for the station's entire existence.
During the early 2000s, the format included syndicated talk radio shows. At the time of the station's closure, it had been a classic hits-formatted station for approximately a decade. For a time in the mid-to-late 2000s, WSPQ streamed its programming on the Internet. It did not do so for its last decade on air. In 2005, Terrance Grant, through holding company Hawk Communications, purchased the station.
Shut Down.
The station ran into financial problems and shut down on December 31, 2017. Grant blamed a declining Western New York economy, WSPQ's small broadcast range (even its daytime signal only covered a mostly rural area spanning 20 miles from the transmitter), increasing expenses and a 2015 transformer failure for the station's lack of profitability.
The station has filed paperwork with the FCC to remain silent through the end of 2018. At that point its license would have to be returned to the FCC. In the filing, the station noted that it had lost $73,000 between the 2015 transmitter failure and its cessation of broadcasting.
Attempted Sale.
On February 12, 2018, Chris Lash (who grew up in nearby Northwest Pennsylvania and is known for his flipping of AM radio stations) announced his intention to purchase the station and return it to air the following month. The revived station was to carry The True Oldies Channel and be targeted at the Buffalo market, with the intent of adding an FM translator.
On May 11, 2018, Lash announced he was withdrawing his agreement to purchase the station, as much of the station's equipment had been stolen during the winter of 2018. The telecommunications providers in the area were unable to provide a studio/transmitter link to the broadcast tower. Under the terms of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Grant had until the end of 2018 to find another buyer and put the station back on the air before its license would be forfeited. WSPQ's license was cancelled on August 27, 2019. Lash died in November 2021.

Tanz

Tanz is the second recording by American guitarist Tim Sparks on the Tzadik Records label, released in 2000. The word () is Yiddish for dance, cognate to the German word with the same meaning.
History.
After the recording of traditional Jewish music arranged for solo guitar on "Neshamah", producer John Zorn combined Sparks with Masada alumnus Greg Cohen and Brazilian percussionist Cyro Baptista. Music critic Ben Kettlewell called the combination of Sparks, Cohen and Baptisto "a wonderful adventure into the myriad of styles of music of the Jewish Diaspora." Cohen and Baptista would reunite with Sparks for two more releases on the Tzadik label.
"Tanz" includes four arrangements of songs by Klezmer clarinetist Naftule Brandwein. Sparks would later record "Little Princess", an entire album of Brandwein arrangements.
Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, critic Sean Westergaard wrote, "Sparks comes from a classical guitar background more than a fingerpicking folky background, and his virtuosic technique is incredible, but always in service to the music, not merely technique... Anyone with a passing interest in either Jewish music or fingerpicked guitar should seek out this recording; it's beautiful." Critic Gary Joyner of "Acoustic Guitar" commented on the music's influences from Brazil, Mexico, Yemen, the Balkans, Africa, and Spain and Sparks' "mastery of these difficult musical forms."
Commenting on the blend of styles used by Sparks, JazzTimes critic Jim Ferguson wrote, "... this beautiful recording isn't jazz per se, but it does have a spontaneity, depth and improvisational aspect that will appeal to anyone willing to step outside their everyday listening experience." "Down Beat" critic John Hadley echoed the blending of styles, writing "With impeccable control, he imparts quiet depth to his close study of the melodies, harmonies and unusual rhythms... No small achievement, Sparks conveys the pathos of the Diaspora in his music." as did "Dirty Linen" critic Paul Emile Comeau: "Not only is the idea of playing such music on acoustic guitar a novel idea but, in the nimble hands of Sparks, it succeeds admirably... The mix of a traditional approach with the jazz nuances that the trio brings to the arrangements makes for compelling and original music which should impress both guitar aficionados and those with a keen interest in the diversity of Jewish music."

Red-bellied newt

The red-bellied newt (Taricha rivularis) is a newt that is native to coastal woodlands in northern California and is terrestrial for most of its life.
Description.
When full grown, the red-bellied newt measures between from its nose to its vent, and between from its nose to its tail. It has grainy skin, and is brownish-black on top with a tomato-red underbelly. The male red-bellied newt often has a dark, broad coloring across the vent, while females do not. Breeding males develop smooth skin and a flattened tail. The red-bellied newt can be distinguished from other coastal newts by its red belly and a lack of yellow in its eyes. 
Distribution and habitat.
The red-bellied newt is found in California along the coast from Bodega in Sonoma County, inland to Lower Lake, and north to Honeydew, Humboldt County. It lives in coastal woodlands, especially in redwood forests. There is a disjunct population south of Sonoma County in the upper watershed of Stevens Creek in the Santa Cruz Mountains that is genetically identical to the Sonoma County population.
Reproduction and ecology.
Newts begin their lives as aquatic larvae similar to tadpoles, though elongated and with external gills. Once newt larvae mature into their adult form, which takes about four to six months, they will leave the water and live underground until they are ready to breed, which is typically in four to six years. Red-bellied newts can live for 20-30 years. 
After reaching reproductive maturity, male red-bellied newts start congregating at stream banks as early as January or February. One to three weeks later, the females join them and the newts mate. Red-bellied newts lay their eggs in fast-flowing streams or rocky rivers. The females lay their eggs in about 12 streamlined clusters with six to 16 eggs each, and the eggs are typically attached to the bottoms of rocks, or on branches and roots leaning into the stream. When the adults leave the stream, instead of moving directly uphill, they move at an angle that leads them somewhat upstream. The females, unlike the males, do not breed every year. 
Homing.
Red-bellied newts have a remarkable homing ability. They make great efforts to always go back to the same spot on the stream. They find their way over several miles of rugged terrain to get back to the spot. Likely, smell is responsible for the homing ability.
Defense.
Red-bellied newts have a brownish-black topside to avoid being noticed. When that fails, and they are seen and disturbed, they pull their heads and tails back to reveal their bright-red undersides. This serves as a warning to potential predators, as red-bellied newts have enough of a neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin, in their skin, eggs, and embryos to potentially kill an adult human, or 1,200 to 2,500 mice. Because red-bellied newts are so poisonous, they are nearly inedible and have no reported predators other than a few species of snake which are resistant to the toxin. Like other newts, red-bellied newts have the ability to regenerate several body parts, including their limbs, eyes, hearts, intestines, upper and lower jaws, and damaged spinal cords.

John Cassidy (artist)

John Cassidy (1 January 1860 – 19 July 1939) was an Irish sculptor and painter who worked in Manchester, England, and created many public sculptures.
Life.
Cassidy was born in the townland of Littlewood Commons, Slane, County Meath, Ireland, on 1 January 1860. He moved to Dublin at the age of 20 to find work. There he attended art classes at night and won a scholarship to study in Milan, Italy. After two years, he moved to Manchester, England, where he lived for the rest of his life. He studied at the Manchester School of Art in 1883 and taught there in 1887.
He created many public sculptures, especially war memorials, and exhibited at the Royal Academy, the Royal Hibernian Academy and in Manchester City Art Gallery. He was for a time assisted in his studios by John Ashton Floyd, a local sculptor. For most of his career, his studio was at Lincoln Grove in Chorlton-on-Medlock.
Works.
The body of Cassidy's work consisted mainly of memorials and statues.
In 1894, the philanthropist Enriqueta Rylands commissioned a statue from Cassidy of her late husband, the textile manufacturer John Rylands. It was placed in the reading room of the John Rylands Library in Manchester, which she founded in her husband's memory. Supporters of the library later commissioned Cassidy to sculpt a statue of Enriqueta herself, which was unveiled in 1907. Both statues still stand today at either end of the library reading room, now part of the Manchester University Library. Also within the library is a sculpted group of three figures representing Theology inspiring Science and Art (1898).
The Manchester Corporation commissioned Cassidy in 1896 to design a large ornamental fountain for Albert Square, Manchester to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The hexagonal Jubilee Fountain stood in the square until the 1920s, when it was moved to Heaton Park. In 1997 during renovations and pedestrianisation of Albert Square the fountain was restored to its original location.
Another noted Manchester work is a 1907 bronze sculpture entitled "Adrift", depicting a family clinging to a raft in a stormy sea, its style showing the influence of the New Sculpture movement. It was exhibited at the New Gallery in London and then gifted by the Manchester industrialist and art collector James Gresham to the Manchester Corporation, who used it as the centrepiece of the new ornamental Piccadilly Gardens, laid out c.1930. In 1953 it was replaced by a fountain and relocated. "Adrift" now stands in front of the Manchester Central Library in St Peter's Square.
A public monument in Bristol commissioned in 1895 from Cassidy rose to prominence in 2020. Cassidy's statue of Edward Colston was erected in the area now known as The Centre to celebrate the philanthropy of the merchant Edward Colston, but had come to be considered controversial due to Colston's involvement in the Atlantic slave trade. On 7 June 2020, the Colston statue was pulled from its plinth by Black Lives Matter protestors and pushed into Bristol Harbour. From June 2021 the statue was exhibited at the M Shed museum in Bristol, in damaged and disfigured condition.
Many of Cassidy's surviving works remain in the Manchester district, while other smaller works are held in private collections.
Selected works.
Works by John Cassidy include:
In the aftermath of World War I, Cassidy was commissioned to sculpt a number of war memorials for towns around Britain, including memorials in Eccles, Heaton Chapel/Heaton Moor, Skipton, Stourbridge and Colwyn Bay.
Death and legacy.
At the end of his life, Cassidy was living in Fallowfield in south Manchester, at 10 Albion Road. Suffering from ill health, he was taken to St Joseph's Hospital in Whalley Range. While in hospital, Cassidy continued to sculpt and was working on a bust of Pope Pius XII when he died there on 19 July 1939, aged 79. He was buried in the Roman Catholic section of Manchester's Southern Cemetery. His headstone bears the inscription, "His hands fashioned the beauty he saw".
Many of his public sculptures remain on view in towns and cities around the United Kingdom today. A 1900 portrait of John Cassidy by Reginald Barber is in the collection of Manchester Art Gallery.

Charity Island Light

Charity Island Light is a lighthouse on Big Charity Island in Lake Huron just off the coast of Au Gres, Northern Michigan.
History.
In 1838, the region was the source of lumber being removed from Lower Michigan via the rivers that enter the lower end of Saginaw Bay. The shoals around Charity Island were a major source of problems, posing an obstacle to lumber vessels. It was not until 1856, however, that funds were allocated to establish a light on the island.
The octagonal cast iron lantern displayed a fixed white Fourth Order Fresnel lens light which was constructed in 1857 with a tower which provided a range of visibility. The Lighthouse Board was in the process of constructing a set of lights up and down the coast, and 13 nautical miles was considered adequate both to keep boats off the island and to navigate from one light to the next.
It was originally equipped with a white, Fourth Order Fresnel lens. Fourth order Fresnel lenses were , with a focal length of , and used of oil per hour. Although a lens in that configuration had a range of up to , the Charity Island lens had a range of 13 nautical miles. In 1900, an acetylene lens replaced the 4th order lens. The lights characteristic changed from steady white light to a flashing light, at 10 second intervals. "Charity Island lighthouse was the first on the Great Lakes to receive such a light
The light was fully automated in 1900.
The original lighthouse keeper’s quarters was a wood duplex; attached by a walkway was the tower. In 1907, the tower was extended to and the dwelling gained a second story. In 1917 the site was the first to be automated with an acetylene lamp.
The light was abandoned since 1939 when Gravelly Shoal was lit, and it rapidly fell apart. It wound up on the Lighthouse Digest "Doomsday List" and required rehabilitation.
The Nature Conservancy is said to own the tower.
Alternatively, another source states that the tower is owned by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and operated by the Arenac County Historical Society.
Present status.
The Charity Island Preservation Committee of the Arenac County Historical Society is restoring the tower. The original keeper's house was razed, and a new restored private residence has been built in its place and on its foundation. It is being operated as a restaurant and a bed and breakfast. A full list of past keepers of the light is maintained for historical reference.
Access.
It is hard to get close enough to this light to see it. In this area, Lake Huron is quite shallow and rocky, and the light is too far out to be seen from shore. Getting a boat near it requires a motor, oars or a long paddle, and considerable care.
However, tours of the island are commercially available on a vessel named the "Miss Charity Isle." Previously, dinner trips through Charity Island Transport Inc. in Au Gres used to allow people to see Gravelly Shoal Light up close, tour the light keeper’s house on the island (before it became an Airbnb), and eat dinner on the island. Today, the day trips now leave from Brown’s Landing RV Park in Alabaster. More details on a day trip to the island can be found at CharityIsland.net.

Wanda (film)

Wanda is a 1970 American independent drama film written and directed by Barbara Loden, who also stars in the title role. Set in the anthracite coal region of eastern Pennsylvania, the film focuses on an apathetic woman with limited options who inadvertently goes on the run with a bank robber.
Inspired by her own past feelings of aimlessness, as well as a newspaper article detailing a woman's participation in a bank robbery, Loden wrote the screenplay for "Wanda" before securing financing through Harry Shuster, a Los Angeles–based producer. The film was shot on location with a small crew of around seven people, primarily in eastern Pennsylvania and Connecticut, and much of the dialog and filming was improvised, with Loden only loosely referring to the screenplay.
"Wanda" was chosen for the 31st Venice International Film Festival, where it won the Pasinetti Award for Best Foreign Film. A restored version of the film was screened out of competition at the 67th Venice International Film Festival in 2010. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
Plot.
Wanda Goronski, an unhappy housewife from rural eastern Pennsylvania, stays on her sister’s couch after leaving her husband. After walking across a coal field and hitching a ride, she arrives late to a divorce court hearing, relinquishes her rights to her children, and grants her husband a divorce.
After losing her job at a sewing factory, Wanda runs away with a man she had a one-night stand with, only for him to abandon her at an ice cream shop. Nearly penniless, she takes a nap in a movie theater, where she is robbed while asleep. Desperate, she goes to a bar to use the restroom and clings to an older man she mistakes for the bartender. The man, Norman Dennis, is a criminal in the process of robbing the bar. Unable to shake Wanda off, he takes her on the run with him. Even after learning about his criminal lifestyle, Wanda decides to stay with Norman, whom she calls "Mr. Dennis."
Wanda spends some time on the road with Norman, during which he becomes physically and emotionally abusive. He sends her to a mall to shop for new clothes while he robs cars in the parking lot. Later, they visit the Holy Land USA theme park, where Norman meets his Evangelical Christian father, to whom he shows unusual courtesy and respect. Afterward, Norman convinces Wanda to act as his lookout for a kidnapping and bank robbery. The robbery goes wrong, and Norman is shot and killed in the lobby. Wanda arrives late and watches from the street as police swarm the scene and onlookers gather.
Once again alone, Wanda hitchhikes with a man who attempts to sexually assault her. She escapes and flees through the woods. At nightfall, she stumbles upon a backwoods roadhouse, where strangers offer her food, alcohol, and cigarettes.
Production.
Concept.
Loden said the film was semi-autobiographical and that she was inspired to write it after reading a newspaper report that a woman had thanked a judge after he sentenced her to 20 years in prison for her participation in a bank robbery. Her husband Elia Kazan claimed to have written the initial script and then Loden "rewrote it many times, and it became hers."
According to Loden, the character of Wanda was "created out of herself." In a 1971 interview, she said, "It was sort of based on my own personality...A sort of passive, wandering around, passing from one person to another, no direction—I spent many years of my life that way and I felt that... well, I think that a lot of people are that way. And not just women, but men too. They don't know why they exist." In crafting the relationship between Wanda and Norman, Loden avoided integrating any legitimate romance between the characters, as she felt it was unrealistic. Wanda's complete submissiveness to Norman was also partly inspired by a nonfiction book Loden had read about the upbringings of several prostitutes, one of whom recounted finding joy in her foster mother's severe overbearingness, as she was "the first person who ever told [her] what to do. She appreciated it, even though the woman was mean."
Filming.
The film was shot on 16mm stock, on a budget of roughly $100,000 with a crew of four: Loden, cinematographer Nicholas Proferes, who also edited the film, Lars Hedman doing lighting and sound, and production assistant Christopher Cromin. Loden and Michael Higgins were the only two professional actors in the production and most of their scenes were a result of improvisation. Loden recalled the logistics of the production as difficult, and said she ended up "using the [actors] as they were" and quit referring to the script shortly after beginning. Loden worked for union scale, and Higgins's costumes came from Kazan's castoffs. Loden said the film's visual style was inspired by several Andy Warhol films.
The film was financed by Harry Shuster, who formed Bardene International Films specifically to distribute it. Shuster had a one-third interest in the film; the other two-thirds was held by Loden, Kazan, and attorney Milton Kazan's nonprofit Foundation for Filmmakers. Any profits after recoupment that went to the foundation were to be put into a fund to finance future films.
Originally slated to be set in the South, the high cost of filming there and the production's need to be near the film processing houses in New York City prompted a change to the coal-mining regions of Pennsylvania. Location shooting took place in fall 1969 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Carbondale, Pennsylvania, and Waterbury, Connecticut. Several of the performers in the film were non-actors who were arbitrarily asked to partake in the film; among these are the man Wanda speaks with in the film's opening sequence on the coal field, as well as the actor portraying Norman's father, whom Loden and Proferes invited to play the part after finding him in a retirement home in Carbondale. The final scene was filmed at an actual roadhouse in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. Loden filmed an alternate ending in which Wanda is accosted by the police at the roadhouse, but she ultimately deemed it "too corny" and opted to conclude the film with a morose Wanda being regaled by the tavern patrons.
Post-production of "Wanda" occurred in Loden's home.
Release.
"Wanda" premiered at the 31st Venice International Film Festival, where it was the only American entry and won the International Critics' Prize for Best Film. It was also exhibited at the London Film Festival and the San Francisco Film Festival.
Restoration.
In 2007, the Hollywood Film and Video laboratory in Los Angeles formally closed, and began purging film elements from its archive dating to the 1950s. The original 16mm Kodak Ektachrome ECB film elements of "Wanda" were uncovered during this purging, and subsequently acquired by the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive, saving them from being disposed of in a landfill. The film elements were restored, and the film was subsequently screened at the Museum of Modern Art in 2010.
In August 2018, the film was re-released theatrically in Los Angeles.
Home media.
"Wanda" was released on DVD in 2006 by Parlour Pictures. In December 2018, the Criterion Collection announced it was releasing the film on Blu-ray and DVD on March 19, 2019.
Reception and legacy.
In Loden's recollection, European critics who saw the film at its Venice Film Festival premiere interpreted it as a political statement on the existential nature of American life, which she refuted. Critics Judith Crist, Kathleen Carroll, and Pauline Kael wrote unfavorably of the film, recounted by Loden as they disliked the protagonist for being "dumb, and stupid, and all the things people used to say about me...  I think they're jealous, I really do...  They were so vicious, it went over call of duty."
Upon its American theatrical release in 1971, the "New York Daily News" awarded the film two and a half out of four stars, noting Wanda as a "sharply-etched" character, but concluded that the film "remains a rather pointless dirge, for there never is any question that Wanda will end her journey from no-place to nowhere." Jean Dietrich of the Louisville "Courier-Journal" praised the film for its portrayal of its characters, writing: "Wanda is a classic loser, underprivileged and underintelligent, who, in her hopelessness, turns to prostitution. Miss Loden's performance of this pathetic creature will stick with me, I think, forever...nothing is more depressing than empty, stunted lives, and Miss Loden shows a sincere concern in recording them so honestly."
Stanley Kauffmann of "The New Republic" called "Wanda" "a small, good work of art".
"The Hackensack Record"s John Crittenden praised Loden's performance but felt the film would not resonate with many American moviegoers: "Sitting in judgment of the character, as audiences are apt to do, I doubt anyone will really like Wanda and sympathize with her. Nobody likes a victim."
The film is a favorite of actress Isabelle Huppert, who championed its release on DVD in France in 2004. The film has also been cited as a favorite by filmmaker John Waters, who presented it as his annual selection within the 2012 Maryland Film Festival.
The film was restored by the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive with funding provided by The Film Foundation and Gucci, and screened at the 67th Venice International Film Festival. The film has a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 36 reviews.
In a retrospective review, Justin Chang of the "Los Angeles Times" wrote: "To say that "Wanda" deglamorizes the American crime film is both entirely accurate and something of an understatement. Loden’s first and only film as a director is a searingly honest character study whose jagged, unvarnished aesthetic—inspired in part by Jean-Luc Godard’s "Breathless" and the films of Andy Warhol—stood in stark contrast to the slick Hollywood dramatic tradition epitomized by, among others, Loden’s husband, the director Elia Kazan."
In 2022, the film appeared on Sight and Sound's critics poll for the Top 100 Films of All Time, tied for #48.

New Hope–Lambertville Bridge

The New Hope–Lambertville Bridge, officially called the New Hope–Lambertville Toll Supported Bridge, is a six-span, -long bridge spanning the Delaware River that connects Lambertville, New Jersey and New Hope, Pennsylvania. The current steel truss bridge was constructed in 1904 at a cost of $63,818.81. It is owned and maintained as a toll-free bridge by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission.
Structure.
The New Hope–Lambertville's vertical truss members are in height. Three of its piers are stone filled and built on timber cribbing. The bridge's abutment, which is from the 1814 bridge, is square blocked masonry. Finally, utilities on the bridge include lighting for the walkway and an eight-inch (203 mm) diameter sewer line.
History.
The original -long and -wide wooden covered bridge was built on September 12, 1814, replacing the service once provided by Coryell's Ferry. Its six wooden arches each measured long and high. Its designer, Lewis Wernwag, was nationally known for his covered bridges.
The flood of 1841 heavily damaged the original bridge. A second wooden covered bridge was constructed in 1842, but was destroyed during the flood of 1903. As was the case with several of the Delaware River's other bridges at the time, the flood encouraged replacing the wooden structure with a modern steel bridge. Thus, the superstructure of the New Hope–Lambertville Bridge dates to 1904, when its steel truss spans were first built. The cost of the 1904 bridge was $63,818.81, several thousand dollars less than the $67,936.37 needed to build the 1814 structure.
In 1919, the Commission For the Elimination of Toll Bridges bought the bridge, freeing the financially struggling private company from its obligations. The bridge has been toll-free since that time.
Prior to 1934, trolleys of the New Jersey and Pennsylvania Traction Company, and later the Trenton-Princeton Traction Company, used the New Hope–Lambertville Bridge to cross back into New Jersey.
The New Hope–Lambertville Bridge was one of the few structures not devastated by the flood of 1955, the greatest that the Delaware River had ever experienced. It did, however, require about a month of repairs, reopening on September 22, 1955.
For many years the New Hope–Lambertville Bridge carried U.S. Route 202 over the Delaware River. However, in 1971, U.S. Route 202 was realigned at Magill's Hill between the Rabbit Run Canal bridge and the Phillip's Mill community on the Pennsylvania side. The New Hope-Lambertville Toll Bridge currently carries Route 202, while the New Hope–Lambertville Toll Supported Bridge connects the re-designated Pennsylvania Route 179 with New Jersey Route 179.
As part of its celebration of the 100th anniversary of the New Hope–Lambertville Bridge in 2004, the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission announced the completion of a major revitalization project that had begun in late 2003. The contract had been awarded to J.D. Eckman, Inc. for the amount of $6,249,207.50. Renovations included improving the pedestrian walkway with new flooring and lighting, fixing the bridge's sewer line, replacing steel members, and blast-cleaning and painting the bridge's structural steel. During construction, bridge traffic fell to 9,700. Beginning in January 2004, shuttle service was offered at no cost to travelers. The bridge reopened June 7, 2004, one week ahead of schedule, and was named "2004 Project of the Year" by the Delaware Valley Section of the American Society of Highway Engineers. The final cost of the project was $6,305,269.

Cheboygan Crib Light

The Cheboygan Crib Light is a light that marks the west pier head of the mouth of the Cheboygan River into Lake Huron. The pier head, in the center of the municipality of Cheboygan, is located at the north or lake end of Huron Street, and is one of the centerpieces of Cheboygan's Gordon Turner Park.
History.
1884-1920: manned light.
The Crib Light is called a "light" rather than a "lighthouse" because it does not contain a structure in which a keeper lived. The Light was originally built in Lake Huron in 1884 on a "crib", an artificial-island landfill, more than from the Cheboygan shore. It is assumed that the keeper lived in Cheboygan; this would have required him to boat daily to the crib, despite weather conditions, to maintain the kerosene-fired light. This was hazardous duty, and in due course davits were installed on the Crib Light; this enabled a boat making dock at the crib to be raised, more easily unloaded, and be protected from the waves.
In 1901 this station was painted white to increase its visibility as a daymark. Two years later, in 1903, the existing wooden structure was torn down to a depth of into the water and a new sturdier concrete steel structure was erected. Iron railings were also installed to aid with safety.
In 1906, the rebuilt light was severely damaged when a schooner hit it. A fog bell was then installed to help prevent such collisions and the railing was replaced. In 1911 an automated fog bell was installed, sounding a characteristic single stroke every ten seconds.
1920-present: automated light.
In 1920, the Lighthouse Service oversaw the automation of the Crib Light. In the Crib Light's new incarnation, kerosene was no longer necessary; instead, a traveling crew periodically delivered tanks of the flammable gas acetylene. A reliable pilot light burned day and night. When the sun set, the resulting drop in temperature would open a precision valve and release a flow of acetylene against the pilot light, causing the light to shine.
When the last Lighthouse keeper left in 1929, it quickly degraded. "The light earned the nickname 'The Dummy'” from the locals."
In the second half of the 20th century, the invention of radar and other electronic aids to navigation began to render many Great Lakes navigational light towers redundant. The Crib Light was considered by the Coast Guard to be "surplus" property. In 1984, the Crib Light tower was removed from its crib and placed on its current base located on the Gordon Turner Park pier head.
As noted by a Coast Guard researcher:
The light earned the nickname “The Dummy” from the locals. When locals learned of the Coast Guard’s plans to demolish the site, an agreement was made to donate the light to the city of Cheboygan. The light was moved to the West Breakwall in Gordon Turner Park. Restoration work has been done on the tower. The grounds are open to the public.
The Cheboygan Crib Light is now maintained by the municipality of Cheboygan; the light itself, which is now powered by electricity, is maintained by a local support group. The light tower is considered by many to be a symbol of Cheboygan. In 2003, the municipality succeeded in clearing its title to the light and erasing its status as "surplus" property nominally under the ownership of the federal General Services Administration.
Location.
The light is in Gordon Turner Park, which is located north of U.S. Highway 23 in Cheboygan, just west of the Cheboygan River. The park is at the end of Huron Street less than north of the highway. The park's boardwalk leads to the Cheboygan River and the light. The light may also be viewed from eastbound lighthouse cruises offered by Shepler's Ferry out of Mackinaw City.
It is not lighted at this time. Visitors to Gordon Turner Park can view and walk around the light at the end of Water Street in Cheboygan. A few blocks upriver is the Cheboygan River Front Range Light.

Pharaoh's Tomb

Pharaoh's Tomb is an MS-DOS platform game created by George Broussard (misspelled as "Broussad") and published by Apogee Software.
The game uses CGA graphics based on the FAST (Fluid Animation Software Technology) engine. Notoriously, objects' positions are determined by their bounding volumes, not their pixel-precise positions on screen.
The game was re-released in 2015 on Steam with support for Windows and macOS.
Plot.
The protagonist, Nevada Smith (a play on Indiana Jones), is an archaeologist and adventurer who is exploring an Egyptian pyramid, hoping to find the Pharaoh's Tomb and get evidence of his findings.
Gameplay.
In each level, the player navigates and avoids obstacles by jumping or falling, evading or killing enemies, and find keys to exit each level. Nevada Smith has no life bar, and is killed instantly when he touches enemies or traps. Nevada Smith can collect coins and masks for extra points. Lethal obstacles include pyramid-themed traps, such as blocks that fire projectiles when Smith passes in front of them, wall spikes, ceiling spikes, floor spikes, moving spikes, and wind. Navigational challenges include moving platforms and elevators. Bonus points are randomly concealed in some bricks, which are awarded when hit from below. Occasionally, Smith will become invisible, where only his hat will be visible. The game contains many dead ends as 'traps' where Smith can become permanently stuck, forcing the player to either quit or reload a saved game. Collecting manuscripts will cause blocks to appear (though they are occasionally traps), and invisible triggers will cause blocks to disappear (usually activated around masks). Collecting an 'F' will temporarily freeze all enemies and traps. Collecting 5 masks earns the player 11,000 points and collecting 100 coins earns the player an extra life.
Release.
"Pharaoh's Tomb" is a four-episode game, with the first episode being released as shareware. Each episode contains 20 levels, and each level consisting of a single room. The episodes are:
The game was later released as an 80-level commercial game called "Pharaoh's Pursuit" published by Lone Star Micro. The game was discontinued on March 2, 2000, and was released as freeware on March 20, 2009.
A sequel, "Arctic Adventure", based on the same engine, features Nevada Smith as the protagonist and has similar gameplay.
Reception.
"Computer Gaming World" called "Pharaoh's Tomb" "lively and imaginative", praising the FAST engine's animation and level design. The magazine said that the low price of the full game made it an "outstanding value".

Clinical cardiac electrophysiology

Clinical cardiac electrophysiology (also referred to as cardiac electrophysiology or simply EP) is a branch of the medical specialty of cardiology concerned with the study and treatment of rhythm disorders of the heart. Cardiologists with expertise in this area are usually referred to as electrophysiologists. Electrophysiologists are trained in the mechanism, function, and performance of the electrical activities of the heart. Electrophysiologists work closely with other cardiologists and cardiac surgeons to assist or guide therapy for heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias). They are trained to perform interventional and surgical procedures to treat cardiac arrhythmia.
The training required to become an electrophysiologist is lengthy and requires eight years after medical school (in the U.S.), entailing three years of internal medicine residency, three years of clinical cardiology fellowship, and two years of clinical cardiac electrophysiology. This is necessary due to the significant complexity of patients that electrophysiologists usually treat, the constant advances in methods and equipment used in their daily practice, making the field of electrophysiology one of the most demanding subspecialties of modern medicine.
An electrophysiology study is any of a number of invasive (intracardiac) and non-invasive recording of spontaneous electrical activity, as well as of cardiac responses to programmed electrical stimulation. These studies are performed to assess arrhythmias, elucidate symptoms, evaluate abnormal electrocardiograms, assess risk of developing arrhythmias in the future, and design treatment.
In addition to diagnostic testing of the electrical properties of the heart, electrophysiologists are trained in therapeutic and surgical methods to treat many of the rhythm disturbances of the heart. Therapeutic modalities employed in this field include antiarrhythmic drug therapy and surgical implantation of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.
Scope of practice, tests and procedures.
Common rhythms dealt with include atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and the supraventricular tachycardias. Abnormal rhythms have multiple ways they can be treated and choosing is often individualized based on symptoms and patient preference.
Diagnostic testing.
Electrophysiologists will commonly employ the following diagnostic tests and may be performed or interpreted exclusively by the electrophysiologist. Other tests such as cardiac stress testing may be included in an evaluation but are not exclusive to electrophysiology.
Medical treatment.
Initial administration and monitoring of the effect of drugs for treatment of heart rhythm disorders. Electrophysiologists are often involved when severe or life-threatening arrhythmias are being treated, or when multiple drugs must be used to treat an arrhythmia.
Antiarrhythmic agents such as flecainide, dofetilide, and amiodarone are commonly used to try to control rhythms.
Catheter ablation.
Ablation therapy is a catheter based ablation of lesions in the heart (with radiofrequency energy, cryotherapy (destructive freezing), microwave, or ultrasound energy) to cure or control arrhythmias (see radiofrequency ablation). Ablation is usually performed during the same procedure as the electrophysiology study during which arrhythmias are attempted to be induced as well as elucidating the mechanism of the arrhythmia for which ablation therapy is sought.
Surgical procedures: pacemaker and defibrillator implantation and follow up.
Implantation of devices include
Additionally, there are, at times, indications to remove these devices and extraction (ie, removal) of these devices can also be performed by electrophysiologists.
Once implanted, long-term clinical follow up and reprogramming of implanted devices also falls to the electrophysiologist.

Anonymous function

In computer programming, an anonymous function (function literal, expression or block) is a function definition that is not bound to an identifier. Anonymous functions are often arguments being passed to higher-order functions or used for constructing the result of a higher-order function that needs to return a function.
If the function is only used once, or a limited number of times, an anonymous function may be syntactically lighter than using a named function. Anonymous functions are ubiquitous in functional programming languages and other languages with first-class functions, where they fulfil the same role for the function type as literals do for other data types.
Anonymous functions originate in the work of Alonzo Church in his invention of the lambda calculus, in which all functions are anonymous, in 1936, before electronic computers. In several programming languages, anonymous functions are introduced using the keyword "lambda", and anonymous functions are often referred to as lambdas or lambda abstractions. Anonymous functions have been a feature of programming languages since Lisp in 1958, and a growing number of modern programming languages support anonymous functions.
Names.
The names "lambda abstraction", "lambda function", and "lambda expression" refer to the notation of function abstraction in lambda calculus, where the usual function would be written , and where is an expression that uses . Compare to the Python syntax of lambda x: M.
The name "arrow function" refers to the mathematical "maps to" symbol, . Compare to the JavaScript syntax of x =&gt; M.
Uses.
Anonymous functions can encapsulate functionality that does not require naming and is intended for short-term or localized use. Some notable examples include closures and currying.
The use of anonymous functions is a matter of style. Using them is never the only way to solve a problem; each anonymous function could instead be defined as a named function and called by name. Anonymous functions often provide a briefer notation than defining named functions. In languages that do not permit the definition of named functions in local scopes, anonymous functions may provide encapsulation via localized scope, however the code in the body of such anonymous function may not be re-usable, or amenable to separate testing. Short/simple anonymous functions used in expressions may be easier to read and understand than separately defined named functions, though lacking a descriptive name may reduce code readability.
In some programming languages, anonymous functions are commonly implemented for very specific purposes such as binding events to callbacks or instantiating the function for particular values, which may be more efficient in a Dynamic programming language, more readable, and less error-prone than calling a named function.
The following examples are written in Python 3.
Sorting.
When attempting to sort in a non-standard way, it may be easier to contain the sorting logic as an anonymous function instead of creating a named function.
Most languages provide a generic sort function that implements a sort algorithm that will sort arbitrary objects.
This function usually accepts an arbitrary function that determines how to compare whether two elements are equal or if one is greater or less than the other.
Consider this Python code sorting a list of strings by length of the string:
»&gt; a = ['house', 'car', 'bike']
»&gt; a.sort(key=lambda x: len(x))
»&gt; a
['car', 'bike', 'house']
The anonymous function in this example is the lambda expression:
lambda x: len(x)
The anonymous function accepts one argument, codice_1, and returns the length of its argument, which is then used by the codice_2 method as the criteria for sorting.
Basic syntax of a lambda function in Python is 
lambda arg1, arg2, arg3, ...: &lt;operation on the arguments returning a value&gt;
The expression returned by the lambda function can be assigned to a variable and used in the code at multiple places.
»&gt; add = lambda a: a + a
»&gt; add(20)
40
Another example would be sorting items in a list by the name of their class (in Python, everything has a class):
»&gt; a = [10, 'number', 11.2]
»&gt; a.sort(key=lambda x: x.__class__.__name__)
»&gt; a
[11.2, 10, 'number']
Note that codice_3 has class name "codice_4", codice_5 has class name "codice_6", and codice_7 has class name "codice_8". The sorted order is "codice_4", "codice_6", then "codice_8".
Closures.
Closures are functions evaluated in an environment containing bound variables. The following example binds the variable "threshold" within an anonymous function that compares input values to this threshold.
def comp(threshold):
 return lambda x: x &lt; threshold
This can be used as a sort of generator of comparison functions:
»&gt; func_a = comp(10)
»&gt; func_b = comp(20)
»&gt; print(func_a(5), func_a(8), func_a(13), func_a(21))
True True False False
»&gt; print(func_b(5), func_b(8), func_b(13), func_b(21))
True True True False
It would be impractical to create a function for every possible comparison function and may be too inconvenient to keep the threshold around for further use. Regardless of the reason why a closure is used, the anonymous function is the entity that contains the functionality that does the comparing.
Currying.
Currying transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each accepting a single argument. In this example, a function that performs division by any integer is transformed into one that performs division by a set integer.
»&gt; def divide(x, y):
... return x / y
»&gt; def divisor(d):
... return lambda x: divide(x, d)
»&gt; half = divisor(2)
»&gt; third = divisor(3)
»&gt; print(half(32), third(32))
16.0 10.666666666666666
»&gt; print(half(40), third(40))
20.0 13.333333333333334
While the use of anonymous functions is perhaps not common with currying, it still can be used. In the above example, the function divisor generates functions with a specified divisor. The functions half and third curry the divide function with a fixed divisor.
The divisor function also forms a closure by binding the variable codice_12.
Higher-order functions.
A higher-order function is a function that takes a function as an argument or returns one as a result. This technique is frequently employed to tailor the behavior of a generically defined function, such as a loop or recursion pattern. Anonymous functions are a convenient way to specify such function arguments. The following examples are in Python 3.
Map.
The map function performs a function call on each element of a list. The following example squares every element in an array with an anonymous function.
»&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
»&gt; list(map(lambda x: x * x, a))
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
The anonymous function takes an argument and returns its square. The above form is discouraged by the creators of the language, who maintain that the form presented below has the same meaning and is more aligned with the philosophy of the language:
»&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
»&gt; [x * x for x in a]
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
Filter.
The filter function returns all elements from a list that evaluate True when passed to a certain function.
»&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
»&gt; list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, a))
[2, 4, 6]
The anonymous function checks if the argument passed to it is even. The same as with map, the form below is considered more appropriate:
»&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
»&gt; [x for x in a if x % 2 == 0]
[2, 4, 6]
Fold.
A fold function runs over all elements in a structure (for lists usually left-to-right, a "left fold", called codice_13 in Python), accumulating a value as it goes. This can be used to combine all elements of a structure into one value, for example:
»&gt; from functools import reduce
»&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
»&gt; reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, a)
120
This performs
The anonymous function here is the multiplication of the two arguments.
A fold does not necessarily produce a single scalar value; it can also generate structured results such as lists. Instead, both map and filter can be created using fold. In map, the value that is accumulated is a new list, containing the results of applying a function to each element of the original list. In filter, the value that is accumulated is a new list containing only those elements that match the given condition.
List of languages.
The following is a list of programming languages that support unnamed anonymous functions fully, or partly as some variant, or not at all.
The following table illustrates several common patterns. Notably, languages like C, Pascal, and Object Pascal—which traditionally do not support anonymous functions—are all statically typed languages. However, statically typed languages can support anonymous functions. For example, the ML languages are statically typed and fundamentally include anonymous functions, and Delphi, a dialect of Object Pascal, has been extended to support anonymous functions, as has C++ (by the C++11 standard). Second, the languages that treat functions as first-class functions (Dylan, Haskell, JavaScript, Lisp, ML, Perl, Python, Ruby, Scheme) generally have anonymous function support so that functions can be defined and passed around as easily as other data types.

Napostá Grande Stream

Napostá Grande Stream is located in the region of Bahía Blanca, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina
It is a stream whose watershed is in Sierra de la Ventana, about northeast to Bahía Blanca. It was essential during the early history of the city of Bahía Blanca as a source of water and also as a natural defense against aborigine. Later on it was useful as a water supply for agriculture. 
It drains to the Atlantic Ocean reaching the Estuary of Bahía Blanca. It forms meanders before and as it enters the city in the area of Club de Golf Palihue, then Parque de Mayo, where a weir has been built at a natural split, to avoid flooding after heavy rains in Ventana mountain range. If flow increases enough and the level of the stream surpasses the weir, water flows also to the alternative branch reaching the estuary through the Maldonado stream.
From there downstream it flows naturally through the city although it has been piped shortly thereafter to create a greenspace named "Paseo de las Esculturas", and a very interesting urban area by which properties increased substantially their price since then. Napostá is heavily contaminated distally, even before reaching the city, probably due to techniques of fertilization carried out in the areas which form its watershed, especially close to the city

Čečejovce

Čečejovce () is a village and municipality in Košice-okolie District in the Košice Region of eastern Slovakia.
History.
The first written document of the village comes from the year 1317 where the settlement is named as "CECH". According to the tools made of stone 35 000 years B. C. and found in the territory of the village it can be made out, that the history of the village is much older and goes back as far as the Older Stone Age. The revealed foundations of ancient Neolithic settlements in various parts of the village's territory (the oldest comes from the period 5 000 years B. C.) prove the existence of numerous settlements with constructed dwellings already in the Stone Age when a considerable part of the territory was still covered by forests.
The Perényi's family was the first owner of the village known from the written document in 1402. Later, the Pédery and the Szirmay families are also named among the other possessors.
According to the records from 1427 the estimated number of inhabitants of the village was 350. Although the village itself wasn't occupied by Turks, it was almost completely unpopulated for fear of Turkish invasions. In 1715 there were only 4 families living here. After withdrawal of the Turks, the possessor of the village Szirmay let Hungarian families settle here. Afterwards Slovak, Polish, and Ruthenian settlers also came to the area.
The oldest building of the village, which stands on its place even today, is a stone church from the age of the Árpáds built in Early Gothic style with the elements of Roman style. The church, which was originally Roman Catholic, belongs to the Reformed Church since the time of Rákóczi's uprising in 1703.
A baroque manor house built in the middle of the 18th century stands close to the Catholic church. The facade of the manor house was remodeled in a neo-classical style at the beginning of the 19th century and is currently under reconstruction. Its main entrance gate from the 19th century has been preserved in its original form until now. 
Opposite the manor house there is a Memorial of World War I and II with the names of war victims from the village written on the stone column. The St. Stefan's Crown on the top of the memorial has its own history. The pyramid shape Millennia Monument, which has a message for the next generations inside, is just opposite.
Geography.
The village lies at an altitude of 205 metres and covers an area of 24.527 km2. The village is located 22 kilometres from Košice.
Ethnicity.
According to the census in 2001, 60,5% of the inhabitants declared themselves as Slovak and 35,8% as Hungarian.
Genealogical resources.
The records for genealogical research are available at the state archive "Statny Archiv in Kosice, Slovakia"

Kirby Hall

Kirby Hall is a Grade I listed Elizabethan country house, located near Gretton, Northamptonshire, England. The nearest main town is Corby. One of the great Elizabethan houses of England, Kirby Hall was built in 1570 for Sir Humphrey Stafford of Blatherwick. In 1575, Sir Christopher Hatton of Holdenby purchased the property, Hatton was Lord Chancellor to Queen Elizabeth I. It is a leading and early example of the Elizabethan prodigy house. Construction on the building began in 1570, based on the designs in French architectural pattern books and expanded in the Classical style over the course of the following decades. The house is now in a semi-ruined state with many parts roof-less although the Great Hall and state rooms remain intact. The gardens, with their elaborate "cutwork" design, complete with statues and urns, have been recently restored.
History.
Elizabeth Vaux, a Catholic recusant leased the hall in 1599, intending to establish John Gerard and other priests in a college in the house. The Privy Council heard of the plan and raided Kirby Hall, hoping to capture the priests, who, with exception of Hugh Sheldon, evaded the search. Abandoning her plans for Kirkby, Vaux extended her house at Harrowden instead. 
Anne of Denmark stayed at Kirby on 9 August 1605 while her husband King James I stayed at Rockingham Castle. James I stayed nine times at Kirby Hall between 1608–1624, one of them in August 1616 for three days. During a royal progress Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox died at Kirby of the "spotted ague" on 30 July 1624.
Kirby Hall was eventually inherited by Edward Finch, the youngest son of Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham and 7th Earl of Winchilsea and Anne Hatton, sole heiress to the 1st Viscount Hatton. Edward's eldest son, George Finch-Hatton married Lady Elizabeth Murray, daughter of the 2nd Earl of Mansfield. In 1791, their eldest son and heir George (later 10th Earl of Winchilsea) was born at Kirby Hall.
During the 1780s, George Finch-Hatton had begun renovating the hall's interior drastically into 18th century style while preserving the exterior intact, he removed and sold the Tudor wood panelling, in exchange for wallpaper and pediment. The Hall began its slow decline when George and Lady Elizabeth's newly built palatial mansion Eastwell Park was finished and the family moved there entirely.
By the late 1880s, the hall had been completely abandoned and in ruins, the 12th Earl of Winchilsea, uncle to Denys Finch Hatton, dreamed to preserve and "if ever his ship came in" to restore the ancestral property to its old splendour, he was never able to carry out his dream. He died in 1898 and the title passed to his brother, Denys's father.
The building and gardens are still owned by the Earl of Winchilsea. The site was designated a scheduled monument in 1927.
Kirby Hall has been used as a filming location in many productions. These include: episode 6 ("Protest and Communication") of Kenneth Clark's "Civilisation", and Patricia Rozema film adaptation of Jane Austen's "Mansfield Park" (1999) and "A Christmas Carol" for Ealing Studios in 1999. In 2014 it was the venue for an edition of BBC One's "Antiques Roadshow".

Universities and antisemitism

There has been antisemitism at universities since the medieval period. Antisemitism has manifested in various ways in universities, including in policies and practices such as restricting the admission of Jewish students by a Jewish quota, or ostracism, intimidation, or violence against Jewish students, as well as in the hiring, retention and treatment of Jewish faculty and staff. In some instances, universities have been accused of condoning the development of antisemitic cultures on campus.
In many jurisdictions, especially since World War II, discriminatory practices, including within the context of a university, are in breach of anti-discrimination laws, though antisemitic cultural values still persists on many campuses.
Middle Ages to the early modern period.
In the early Middle Ages, higher education in Europe largely centered around the monastery and was dominated by Roman Catholic men. Jews were rarely admitted to universities and faced a hostile environment when they were. Many medieval anti-Judaism writings were authored by university faculty.
In 1264, a man named "Jacob the Jew" sold land for the purpose of establishing Merton College, one of the first colleges to be incorporated in Oxford. Although a Jewish man facilitated the founding of the College, Jews were strictly prohibited from studying at Oxford, a prohibition that would remain in effect for more than 500 years. In 1608, an exception was made for Jacob Wolfgang, after he formally professed faith in Christianity. Wolfgang endured anti-Semitic bullying and violence at the college. One witness described students and tutors making fun of Wolfgang's Greek pronunciation and throwing rotten eggs at him during class.
On 7 September 1434, the Roman Catholic church placed a ban on conferring any university degree upon Jews at the 24th canon of the Council of Basel. However, some ignored this decree, with the Senate of Venice in Italy bypassing the papal ban by empowering an official to confer degrees in higher education without regard to religion; as a result, some Jews in the 16th century managed to obtain doctoral degrees from Italian universities, including Bologna, University of Ferrara, Pavia, Perugua, Pisa, Rome, and Siena. Between 1517 and 1721, the University of Padua conferred 228 doctorates upon Jews.
However, even when admitted to a university, Jews faced challenges from both their religious principles and discriminatory treatment. For example, to fulfill their religious principles of Sabbath and holiday observance, Jewish students resort to various strategies in connection with examinations. Discrimination was experienced, for example, when Jewish had to pay higher graduation fees than did the Christian students or, in the 15th century, when they were required to invite all other students to dinner. Additionally, Jewish physicians in the 16th century had few, if any, opportunities for medical research, teaching, or for admission to the leading hospitals. 
Overall, Jews were said to be kept out of universities by "a formidable iron curtain." Yet there were exceptions, such as the offer of a faculty position to Baruch Spinoza, a Jewish proponent of freedom of thought, by Heidelberg University.
18th and 19th century.
With the Jewish emancipation period, Jewish students were increasingly admitted to universities, such as Polish Jews studying medicine at the University of Padua, Jews entering German universities, and Jews graduating from the Ivy League colleges in the U.S.
During this period, Johann Jakob Schudt, a Catholic author from Frankfurt, expressed concern over the Italian universities' disregard for the canon law of the Council of Basel. He criticized institutions such as the University of Padua for allowing "ignoramuses and even the despised Jews" to obtain degrees. Johann Heinrich Schuette later asserted in 1745 that awarding a medical doctorate to a Jew was inconsistent with Christian beliefs. As a result, Jews were largely excluded from the majority of European universities during this period.
The 19th century saw the tide of liberalism sweeping across England and academia, leading to the partial dismantling of old barriers. Beginning in 1856, openly Jewish students were permitted to study at Oxford University. However, pervasive snobbery and prejudice persisted, resulting in a notably low number of openly Jewish students.
Government policies facilitated Jewish enrollments, thanks to the European Enlightenment. Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, issued a Patent of Toleration in 1782, Prussia enacted reforms starting in 1812, England started a secularized university (University College London) in 1827 and abolished religious restrictions at Oxford and Cambridge in 1871. 
During the 19th Century, Jewish scholars began to receive more regular appointments to university faculty, serving as professors at German, U.S., and even Russian universities. 
However, Jewish students had to function in university settings that could be inhospitable. In Germany, Jews sometimes kept their Jewish identity under wraps, though they did form Jewish student associations by the 1880s. According to one scholar, they "students and student associations wove together a beautiful, vibrant and multifarious tapestry of German Jewish identity." There was an anti-semitic backlash toward the end of the 19th century in Germany, when Jewish students encountered university faculty advocating modern racial antisemitism.
20th and 21st century.
During the 20th century, there was strong growth in Jewish student enrollments and the inclusion of Jewish scholars in university research and teaching. However, Jewish enrollments were limited by policies in Poland, Hungary, Romania, and, during Stalin's regime, the USSR. During the Nazi era, German universities harbored antisemites and Jewish students and faculty were among the many targets of antisemitic persecution. 
Demonstrating an interest in scholarship and education, in the face of persistent antisemitism, Jews also established universities, including Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1925), Yeshiva University (1928), and the Jewish-sponsored, secular Brandeis University (1946).
By the 1970s, Jews also started to serve as the administrative leaders at universities, including presidents or rectors at universities in Prague, Padua, Queens College, the University of Chicago, M.I.T., Brandon University, and Rutgers.
Antisemitism itself became an object of university research and teaching during the 20th century. For example, in 1920s Sweden, Hugo Valentin "staked out a new approach to the topic of antisemitism, in which Jewish characteristics and the so-called Jewish question, while not completely absent, were placed within parentheses. Instead, he presented antisemitism and individual antisemites as problems in their own right..." Besides extensive historical research, there has been in-depth research on antisemitism in psychology. The sociology of antisemitism can be traced back to Jewish scholars of early sociology, including Franz Boas, Arthur Ruppin and Georg Simmel, and includes Talcott Parsons' 1942 article, "The Sociology of Modern Anti-Semitism," and other studies in the post-War era. By the 1980s, some universities had established Holocaust research centers around the world, which also served to foster research on antisemitism.
Since 2000, evidence of antisemitic incidents on university campuses across North America, Europe, and Australia have been recorded by a number of sources. Though the circumstances surrounding the reported incidents are disputed, some maintain that campus activism supportive of the Palestinians and critical of Israel has created an atmosphere of anti-Jewish intimidation that erupts periodically in hate speech and even violence.&lt;ref name="zoloth1/3"&gt;Zoloth, Laurie. "Fear and Loathing at San Francisco State" in Rosenbaum, Ron. "Those who forget the past". Random House, 2004, pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Others acknowledge that antisemitic incidents have occurred, but dispute the extent of them, and contend that commentators have conflated political anger with ethnic or religious hatred in an attempt to chill legitimate debate.
Australia.
In Australia, Daniel Wyner of the Australasian Union of Jewish Students, says that the "vilification we feel as students on campus ... [is] coming almost entirely from the left." Grahame Leonard, president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, says July 2006 had the most antisemitic incidents since records began in 1945, and that many of the incidents were on campus. In Sydney, some Jewish students have started to wear hats over their kippahs. Deon Kamien, former Victorian president of the Union of Jewish Students, told "The Age": "It's not something I can put in words. A lot of students who would feel very comfortable wearing a kippah or T-shirt with Hebrew words on it now feel they are being targeted as Jews — not supporters of Israel, but Jews. When they walk past socialist stalls (on campus) they are called fucking Jews."
Canada.
Historian Gerald Tulchinsky has written that Canadian universities were "rife with antisemitism" in the early 20th century. Some universities restricted Jewish admission, Jews were banned from many fraternities and sororities, and many Jewish medical students were unable to find placements in Canada after graduation. (Despite this, Tulchinsky has also written that Canadian universities were "not hotbeds of antisemitism" in general and, indeed, that they played a significant role in the development of a Canadian Jewish culture.)
McGill University and the University of Toronto.
McGill University imposed strict maximum quotas on Jewish students in 1920. Before the quotas were introduced, Jewish students represented 25% of arts students and 40% of law students. These rates fell significantly in the following years.
McGill continued to impose a 10% maximum quota on Jewish medical students until the 1960s; it was sometimes noted that the francophone Université de Montréal, unlike McGill, did not restrict Jewish admission after World War II. The University of Toronto's medical school also required higher marks of Jewish students until the 1960s, and Toronto's Jewish Mount Sinai Hospital was denied status as a teaching hospital until 1962.
Queen's University.
In 1912, despite strong protests from Canada's Jewish community, the Government of Ontario approved a new constitution for Queen's University that included a phrase affirming that "the trustees shall satisfy themselves of the Christian character of those appointed to the teaching staff." In 1919, newly appointed principal R. Bruce Taylor made antisemitic statements at a meeting of university alumni, saying that "[t]he presence of many Jews tended to lower the tone of Canadian Universities." At least one graduate protested against this statement to the university's chancellor. Notwithstanding these developments, Tulchinsky has written that Queen's was "mildly more liberal" than McGill and the University of Toronto in accepting Jewish students and hiring Jewish faculty. Unlike the other universities, Queen's admitted German Jewish refugees as students in the 1930s and 1940s.
Concordia University.
In September 2002, then-former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was prevented from delivering a speech at Concordia University in Montreal after a student protest turned violent. Some protesters harassed the predominantly Jewish audience that had arrived for the speech, and there were reports of Holocaust survivors being assaulted. Figures such as World Jewish Congress secretary Avi Beker described the incident as indicative of an "anti-Semitic campaign" on North American campuses, while journalist Lysiane Gagnon accused the university's pro-Palestinian students union of "refus[ing] to blame those who broke windows, threw chairs around, spat at and shoved the Jewish students who wanted to hear Mr. Netanyahu". The student union's vice-president of communications rejected Gagnon's charge, saying that his organization had on many occasions "publicly condemned any acts of physical violence [...] especially those acts that were antisemitic or anti-Arab in nature." A representative of Concordia's Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights organization claimed that only a small minority of protesters had engaged in violent acts and argued that the protest itself was justified.
Analysis of Canadian universities.
The author Rick Salutin argues that accusations of a "new anti-Semitism" in contemporary Canada are usually unspecific, and do not include verifiable names or quotations. He has also written that incidents of "name calling and group hate" at protests are not indicative of a new wave of antisemitism, which is universally regarded as unacceptable within mainstream Canadian discourse.
France.
In France, Patrick Klugman, President of the Union of French Jewish Students (UEJF), wrote in "Le Figaro" in 2003: "On some university campuses like Nanterre, Villetaneuse and Jussieu, the climate has become very difficult for Jews. In the name of the Palestinian cause, they are castigated as if they were Israeli soldiers! We hear 'death to the Jews' during demonstrations which are supposed to defend the Palestinian cause. Last April, our office was the target of a Molotov cocktail. As a condition for condemning this attack, the lecturers demanded that the UEJF declare a principled position against Israel!"
Germany.
In April 1933, Nazi Germany passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with "virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed. Notable German academics supportive of the Nazi regime included Martin Heidegger and Carl Schmitt.
Support for the Nazi regime was widespread across German higher education with almost no opposition. According to historians, "the universities made no serious effort in 1933–34 to resist the inroads of the Nazi state" and "Despite the presence of anti-intellectualism in the Nazi movement, however, we find a great deal of enthusiasm for Adolf Hitler in German universities. Student organizations had often turned Nazi even before Hitler rose to power, and the bulk of the faculty applauded Hitler's rise in 1933. Viewed from another angle, we search almost in vain for evidence of opposition to the regime within the universities." German universities not only assisted but "actively supported the expulsion of their academics for racial or political reasons." 
In 1933, university students and members of the German Student Union launched a campaign of Nazi book burnings of Jewish, left-wing, and other books 'incompatible' with Nazi ideology. "On May 10, 1933, university students in 34 university towns across Germany burned over 25,000 books. The works of Jewish authors like Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud went up in flames alongside blacklisted American authors such as Ernest Hemingway and Helen Keller, while students gave the Nazi salute. In Berlin 40,000 people gathered to hear German Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda Joseph Goebbels give a speech in Berlin's Opera Square. He declared "the era of extreme Jewish intellectualism is now at an end. ... The future German man will not just be a man of books, but a man of character. It is to this end that we want to educate you." "The Guardian" reported that "Professors marched with students and Nazi Storm Troops escorting the ox carts, on which the books were laden, to the Opera House, where they were thrown on a bonfire of torches."
Most German academics quietly accepted or supported the Nazi regime and their university reforms and passively benefited from the persecution of their Jewish academic peers. "Very few, such as the small student group in Munich known as the White Rose, took any significant action to resist the Nazi dictatorship." There also existed a National Socialist German Students' League and Lecturers League. About two dozen leading professors received honorary or military appointments in the SS. According to historian Béla Bodo,[German] students acted as a vanguard of Nazism at institutions of higher learning after 1933. Their continuing demonstrations against non-Aryan professors and the tacit support that they gave to radical Nazis to attack or otherwise harass their Jewish colleagues helped legitimize the Nazi revolution. Radical Nazis, backed by perhaps the majority of students, also pressured the authorities to move against the Jewish students. Their unruly behavior especially terrified conservative academic administrators, many of whom began registering nonAryans soon after the Nazi takeover.
Academic administrators acquiesced in and helped carry out the expulsion of Jewish students for a number of reasons: some were convinced Nazis and radical antisemites who believed that the “cleansing” of schools was a prerequisite for the building of a new Germany; others supported the removal of non-Aryans for professional reasons; still others saw permanent exclusion as the only way of restoring peace on the campuses. As a telling sign of the professors’ attitude toward Hitler's regime, the rectors not only adhered to, but also tried to go beyond the first antisemitic laws in order to accelerate the expulsion process.German university societies and fraternities were crucial in fomenting antisemitism and spreading Nazi ideology on university campuses. The German Student Union was in fact the first national organisation which fell under Nazi control as early as 1931. Paramilitary student groups often interrupted lectures, provoked skirmishes, and physically intimidated Jewish students in actions tolerated by university administrations and encouraged by the Nazi Party.
Professors in a wide range of disciplines, including the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences, used their research to further the goals of the Nazi regime. Carl Clausberg, a professor of gynaecology at the University of Königsberg experimented on Jewish and Romani women at the Auschwitz concentration camp in order to sterilise them without anaesthetic. Konrad Meyer, a professor of agronomy at the University of Berlin and SS-Oberführer, helped formulate "Generalplan Ost," the Nazi plan for the extermination and large-scale ethnic cleansing of Slavs, Eastern European Jews, and other indigenous peoples of Eastern Europe categorized as "Untermenschen" in Nazi ideology. Nearly 900 professors signed the Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State in 1933.
Hungary.
Moshe Y. Herczl has written that universities were part of a larger phenomenon of antisemitism in Hungary after World War I. Christian university students, sometimes joined by their professors, took part in violent demonstrations against Jewish student enrollment during the autumn of 1919. The authorities were forced to temporarily close the universities as a result of the disruption. Shortly thereafter, the Hungarian government prepared a law limiting Jewish enrollment to about 6% of the total university population.
Several departments at Peter Pazmany Catholic University in Budapest supported the proposed quota, as did the administration at the Technical University of Budapest. Some professors called for Jews to be banned from Hungarian universities entirely. After some debate, the Hungarian parliament passed the quota legislation by a vote of 57–7. It came into effect at the beginning of the 1920 academic year, coinciding with another round of antisemitic rioting on campuses. The number of Jews in Hungarian academic institutions fell dramatically in this period; at the University of Budapest, the numbers declined from 4,288 in 1917–18 to only 459 in 1920–21. Several European Jewish organizations opposed the Hungary quota law, arguing that it created a precedent that would be followed by other governments.
Antisemitic rioting continued at Hungarian universities into the 1930s; Jewish students were ostracized and often physically attacked. Christian student associations introduced a petition in 1933 that called for a strict enforcement of government quotas, while other groups passed antisemitic manifestos. The disruption once again led to a temporary closing of the universities.
Further antisemitic legislation was passed by the Hungarian parliament in 1939, on the eve of World War II. Among many other things, this legislation further restricted Jewish enrollment in universities.
United Kingdom.
In the UK, the "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism" in 2006 reported that "when left wing or pro-Palestinian discourse is manipulated and used as a vehicle for anti-Jewish language and themes, the anti-Semitism is harder to recognize and define ..." The report describes how "tensions and incidents on campus often peak around students' union votes concerning Israel and Zionism," listing by way of example several incidents precipitated by a 2002 University of Manchester students' union motion to declare that anti-Zionism was not antisemitism, and that Israeli goods should be boycotted. During the voting phase, according to the Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester, a leaflet from the General Union of Palestinian Students quoting a neo-Nazi forgery entitled "Prophecy of Benjamin Franklin in Regard of the Jewish Race", was handed out to students lining up to vote. The leaflet described Jews as vampires, and said that if they were not expelled from the United States, they would "enslave the country and destroy its economy." When the motion was defeated, a brick was thrown through the window of one Jewish student residence while a poster with the words "Slaughter the Jews" was stuck to its front door, and a knife was stuck in the door of another.
In October, 2020, UK Education secretary Gavin Williamson sent a letter to vice-chancellors at English universities, accusing the universities of ignoring antisemitism.
In 2021, University of Bristol fired Professor David Miller following accusations of antisemitic comments. Miller had reportedly showed diagrams to students linking Jewish charities to Zionist lobbies and described the university's Jewish society as an 'Israel lobby group'. After being fired, Miller was quoted as saying 'Israel's assets in the UK have been emboldened by the university collaborating with them to shut down teaching about Islamophobia', while the Jewish society praised the decision. Since then, Miller has made other controversial comments, including a tweet claiming that 'Jews are not discriminated against' and are 'overrepresented in Europe, North America and Latin America in positions of cultural, economic and political power' 
During the Gaza war, the Jewish charity organisation 'Community Security Trust' (CST) reported that there had been 67 antisemitic incidents from 7 October to 3 November across 29 campuses - an increase from 12 in the same period during the previous year. CST's follow-up report noted 272 antisemitic incidents during the 2023-2024 school year, over five times the number in the previous year. In one example, the University of Leeds Jewish chaplain received threats to rape and kill his wife and murder his children.
United States.
With the increase in Jewish immigration, U.S. universities increased enrollments for Jewish students but also restricted admissions in some well-documented cases, such as Harvard and Stanford. 
A survey published in February 2015 by Trinity College and the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights under Law found that 54% of the participants had been subject to or witnessed antisemitism on their campus. The survey had a 10-12% response rate, does not claim to be representative, and included 1,157 self-identified Jewish students at 55 campuses nationwide. The most significant origin for antisemitism, according to the survey was "from an individual student" (29%). Other origins were: In clubs/societies, in lecture/class, in student union, etc.
However, a 2017 report from Brandeis University's Steinhardt Social Research Institute indicated that most Jewish students never experience anti-Jewish remarks or physical attacks. The study, "Limits to Hostility," notes that though often reported in the news, actual antisemitic hostility remains rare on most campuses.
The study attempts to document student experience at the campus level, adding more detailed information to national-level surveys like the 2015 Trinity College Anti-semitism report. The report summary highlights that, though antisemitism does exist on campus, "Jewish students do not think their campus is hostile to Jews" across the campuses surveyed.
In September 2021, in collaboration with the Cohen Group, the Brandeis Center conducted a poll of American Jewish fraternity and sorority members. The survey found that more than 65% of the respondents had experienced or were familiar with an antisemitic attack in the previous 120 days. Nearly half of the respondents felt the need to hide their Jewish identity out of fear.
In 2022, several student groups at the University of Berkeley's School of Law banned inviting speakers who support Zionism or the State of Israel, citing concern for "the safety and welfare of Palestinian students on campus." However, whether anti-Zionism constitutes antisemitism is a longstanding, heavily disputed topic of political debate; Jewish individuals, Jewish allies, and antisemites have all expressed positions for or against Zionism.
In an effort to reduce the rise of antisemitism on college campuses, the Biden administration launched the first ever national strategy to combat antisemitism on May 25, 2023.
In February 2025, Leo Terrell, the chair of the Department of Justice's Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, announced that he would investigate Columbia University, Harvard University, George Washington University, Johns Hopkins University, New York University, Northwestern University, Berkeley University, the University of California, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Southern California as part of the Department of Justice's broader investigation into antisemitism on college campuses.
2023 United States Congress hearing on antisemitism.
With the outbreak of the Gaza war (2023), U.S. universities became a focal point for activism about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and concomitant concerns about antisemitism. 
In December 2023, the presidents of Harvard, MIT, and UPenn testified in a five-hours long congressional hearing on antisemitism on campuses. The hearing resulted from the Department of Education's investigation into campus antisemitic incidents since the October 7th Hamas-led attack on Israel. The hearing gained widespread attention after presidents were each asked whether "calling for the genocide of Jews" violated their rules of bullying and harassment. During the hearing when Kornbluth, who is Jewish, said she had not heard any calls for genocide, Rep. Elise Stefanik claimed that chants of "Intifada" (Arabic) may be considered a "call for the genocide" of Jewish people. Each president replied that the answer at their institution depended on context. 
Following the hearing, President Liz Magill had posted a public apology and later resigned due to pressure from donors and criticism over her testimony. Claudine Gay, president of Harvard, responded that it depended on the context, but when "speech crosses into conduct, that violates our policies." Some alumni and donors called for Gay to resign and withdrew donations. Gay apologized for her remarks in the hearing and Harvard's board chose to keep her in office. On 2 January 2024, Gay resigned from the presidency of Harvard, partly due to accusations of plagiarism.
Additionally, a U.S. House of Representatives committee opened an investigation into the three schools that testified in the hearing. Congresswoman Virginia Foxx explained her dedication to exposing antisemitism by paraphrasing Genesis 12:3: "if you bless the Jewish people you will be blessed. If you curse the Jewish people you will be cursed.”
Harvard.
Harvard University introduced policies in the twentieth century to reduce the number of Jews admitted to the university. The policies were introduced in response to the growing number of Jews admitted to the university, with the number of Jewish students admitted to Harvard growing from 7% in 1900 to 27.6% in 1925.
The policies were spearheaded by Abott Lawrence Lowell, president of Harvard University from 1909-1933. Lowell labeled the growth of Jewish students at Harvard as the "Jew problem" and asserted that the growing number of Jewish students at Harvard would "ruin the college." Lowell and others' prejudice against Jewish students were not based on religion, but more so on ethnic prejudice that framed Jews as "lacking class," being "overly grasping," and "overly ambitious" in their academic pursuits while showing little interest in extracurriculars. Non-Jews charged Jews with being "clanny, socially unskilled, and either unwilling or unable to 'fit in.'" Furthermore, there was also a prejudice against Jews because of their status as immigrants and people of lower socioeconomic status.
To reduce the number of Jewish students at Harvard, Lowell asked the committee of admissions to impose higher standards of admissions to members of "the Hebrew race," and wanted to cap the ratio of Jews in the student body at 15%. However, the admissions committee rejected this request because they were "reluctant to publicly endorse a policy of discrimination." Instead, the committee of admissions agreed to shift admissions in a way that would discreetly disadvantage Jews. Instead of continuing to admit students based on merit and academic achievement alone, which favored prospective Jewish students as they tended to measurably score higher on entry exams, admissions decided to introduce "character" and "fitness" criteria, which gave them more control over who was admitted and allowed them to weed out many of the academically high scoring prospective Jewish students who they deemed to not 'fit in' with the rest of the student body. Most of the time, this meant that the only Jews admitted to the university were those who did not publicly identify with their Jewishness and who did not fit ethnic stereotypes. In addition, Harvard also shifted to the prioritization of legacy admissions. By giving preference to children of alumni, Harvard could maintain the upper-class protestant student body, and exclude the children of Jewish immigrants.
Although disguised, these changes in admissions procedures intentionally and effectively reduced the number of Jewish students admitted to Harvard without having to actually say so. In 1926, the percentage of Jews dropped from 27% to 15%, and held steady at 15% for decades thereafter.
Harvard since 2020.
In 2022, a report by AMCHA Initiative had determined that Harvard University had the most antisemitic incidents on college campuses during the 2021-2022 academic year. The report mentioned dozens antisemitic incidents including Harvard University's campus newspaper endorsing the BDS movement (which described as rejecting “Jewish-self determination altogether” by Jewish leaders), held an event that was designed to “decolonize or de-Zionize Jewishness itself" by Harvard Professor Atalia Omer and more.
In October 2023, Harvard's alumni voiced their concern regarding the rise of antisemitism on campus following the October 7 attacks. In an open letter, the alumni condemned the ‘threatening’ nature of pro-Palestinian protests on campus. They also condemned the silence from several Harvard leaders regarding antisemitism on campus. The alumni letter also mentioned an assault against an Israeli student on campus.
On January 10, 2024, students filed a lawsuit against Harvard, led by Shabbos Kestenbaum, accusing it of having become a "bastion of rampant anti-Jewish hatred and harassment".
In January 2025, Harvard University settled two civil rights lawsuits accusing the university of allowing antisemitism on campus. As part of the settlement, Harvard agreed to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, incorporate it into its nondiscrimination policies, and implement mandatory staff training to address antisemitism. The settlement also included commitments to provide resources for the study of antisemitism, establish a partnership with an Israeli university, and host an annual symposium on antisemitism. While Harvard denied any wrongdoing or liability, these measures were introduced to address the safety and inclusion of Jewish students on campus.
Cornell University.
After the October 7 attacks, Cornell University professor Russell Rickford spoke at an October 15 rally, calling the Hamas attacks "exhilarating". The university leadership condemned his remarks, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Congresswoman Claudia Tenney called for him to be fired. He subsequently apologized for the remarks in "The Cornell Daily Sun". On October 21, it was announced that Rickford would be taking a leave of absence for the remainder of the semester.
On October 29, threats against the Jewish community at Cornell University were posted online, threatening to shoot, rape, and murder Jewish students and encouraging violence against them. The FBI is investigating the incident as a hate crime. As of October 31, the New York State Police announced they had a person of interest in custody.
Duke University.
Duke's chapter of Students Supporting Israel (SSI), an international pro-Israel movement, was denied recognition by the Duke Student Government (DSG) in November 2021. The incident attracted national media attention, and Duke SSI was officially recognized as a student organization in February 2022 after the student government reconsidered the group's application.
The sitting DSG president vetoed the recognition of Duke SSI in November 2021 five days after the group was recognized by the DSG Senate due to Duke SSI's social media response to claims of "promoting colonialism." This veto was upheld in a meeting by the Senate just two days later.
The incident garnered attention from a variety of individuals, outlets, and organizations. Duke President Vincent E. Price and Provost Sally Kornbluth issued a statement reiterating the university's commitment to equity. Other organizations such as The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and the Zionist Organization of America, advocated on behalf of SSI after Duke's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) challenged SSI's existence. The Brandeis Center sent a letter to President Price alleging that the derecognition of Duke SSI constituted discrimination against a Jewish student organization.
DSG ultimately recognized SSI as a student organization on February 23, 2022.
Emory.
Between 1948 and 1961, Emory University's former dental school engaged in discriminatory practices against Jewish students under the leadership of dean John Buhler. Arthur Levin, former Regional Director of the Anti-Defamation League, was the first to conduct research on the issue, and he found that 65% of Jewish students at Emory University's former dental school were flunked out or forced to repeat courses during those years, despite sound academic achievements and manual skills. Levin found that the rate of failures and repeats during that period was significantly higher than the rate of failures and repeats of Jews in years past and was also higher than the rate of failures and repeats of non-Jews during that period.
In 1961, Levin took his research findings to then Emory President, Walter Martin; however, the pattern of discrimination was consistently dismissed and denied. Evidence of discrimination mounted in the 1960s when the dental school changed its application form to include a section that asked applications to indicate their race as Caucasian, Jew, or other. Buhler resigned in 1961 but denied that it had to do with the allegations, and there was no acknowledgement or apology for the discriminatory practices.
In 2006, Associate Professor Eric Goldstein curated an exhibit on Jews at Emory, which included a bar graph that highlighted the rates of failures and forced repeats of Jews in the 50's. The exhibit inspired former dental student, S. Perry Brickman, to organize the production of a documentary film titled, "From Silence to Recognition: Confronting Discrimination in Emory's Dental School History." In the film, former students recalled the shock of receiving letters from the school saying that their work was not up to par, with one student recalling the dean asking him, "Why do you Jews want to go into dentistry? You don't have it in the hands." A common thread of the film was the shame students felt for decades thereafter. After the film premier, participants received a personal apology from President James Wagner, the first formal acknowledgement and apology from the school.
George Washington University.
On the first day of classes in August 2022, George Washington University psychology professor Lara Sheehi allegedly told an Israeli student in front of other students: "It's not your fault you were born there." Jewish students reported that Sheehi harassed that same student by encouraging other students to demean and exclude them. They criticized Sheehi's choice of Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian as guest lecturer on September 30, 2022. In 2019, Dr. Shalhoub-Kevorkian praised a teenager for attempting to stab two Israelis to death and allegedly used antisemitic language in her classes at Hebrew University. After Dr. Shalhoub-Kevorkian spoke to the class, Jewish students reported feeling "unsafe" and one student left the class crying. Jewish students claim that when they tried to explain their discomfort hearing Dr. Shalhoub-Kevorkian speak, Sheehi accused them of using Islamophobic language and being anti-Palestinian.
Jewish students accused newly-unearthed tweets from Sheehi's since-deleted Twitter account of being antisemitic, such as tweets calling to "destroy Zionism" and describing the Israeli military "genocidal fucks." Jewish students also expressed disappointment when Sheehi refused to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism to define hatred of Jews, because she felt it would interfere with the George Washington University's free speech principles.
In January 2023, Jewish students filed a complaint at the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR). As a result of the OCR complaint, school administrators a third-party investigation from independent law firm, Crowell &amp; Moring LLP. In February 2023, Sheehi responded to the January OCR complaint and investigation. Sheehi asked school administrators to release the in-class recording to prove she said nothing antisemitic.
In May 2023, Crowell &amp; Moring cleared Sheehi of antisemitism charges, having found a lack of supportive evidence to prove the claims. Crowell &amp; Moring, George Washington University administrators, and Jewish students all agreed to pursue remediation. School administrators also brought in facilitators to create a "restorative circle" – a mechanism bringing community members together to discuss harmful behavior in a path towards accountability – between faculty and students.
Although George Washington administrators closed their investigation, the OCR investigation remains open.
Stanford.
Stanford University launched an internal task force in 2022 to investigate the history of Jewish admissions and experience at the university. The task force was formed after the publication of an online newsletter by Dr. Charles Petersen in 2021 entitled "How I Discovered Stanford's Jewish Quota". In that newsletter, Dr. Petersen shared letters and documents he found in the Stanford archives that pointed toward a pattern of discrimination against Jewish applicants at Stanford in the 1950s. Petersen's essay was the first to substantiate rumors regarding the existence of a quota on Jewish students at Stanford that had been floating for decades. The task force was intended to conduct university-led research to confirm, deny, or elaborate on Petersen' findings.
The task force confirmed Petersen's claims, while adding additional evidence that the university intended to reduce and restrict the number of Jewish students at Stanford University. The New York Times reported in an opinion piece how the results of the Task Force were "long awaited" and came as "no shock" to the Jewish community. The task report highlighted a 1953 letter from Rixford Snyder, Assistant of Admissions Director, to J.E. Wallace Sterling, then President of Stanford. In the letter, Snyder informed Sterling of the fact that the incoming freshmen class would have "a high percentage of Jewish boys," a "problem" Snyder thought Sterling should know, "since it has very touchy implications." Rix elaborated and warned of how schools in the East, such as the University of Virginia and Cornell, have a very heavy Jewish enrollment and have become largely Jewish institutions.
Also uncovered by the task force was a memo explaining that Snyder identified "a number of high schools in Los Angeles," including Beverly Hills High School and Fairfax High School, "whose student body [sic] runs from 95 to 98% Jewish." Snyder wrote, "if we accept a few Jewish applicants from these schools, the following year we get a flood of Jewish applications," noting that "apparently the information as to who is accepting or rejecting Jewish students travels fast though [Sic] the underground." In light of this, admissions decided to first stop including Beverly Hills and Fairfax high school in recruiting efforts and then reject the majority of those who still applied.
Snyder's strategy was effective as the number of Jewish students enrolled at Stanford from these schools dropped after implementing these changes. According to the task report, Stanford enrolled 67 students from Beverly Hills and 20 students from Fairfax between 1949 and 1952, but only 13 students from Beverly Hills and 1 from Fairfax between 1952 and 1955. The registrars' records indicate no other public school experienced such a steep drop in student enrollment during that time period, or any other period during the 1950s and 1960s. The task force asserted that it is reasonable to conclude that the drop in enrollment was due to the university's reduction in both recruitment and offers of admissions to Jewish high school students, and that this reduction was intentional and targeted.
Stanford University's Task Force also addressed how the university evaded claims that they were discriminating against Jewish applicants and students. The report notes that students, parents, and alumni who raised concerns had their concerns immediately denied and dismissed by the administration. In letters and in public, administrators took advantage of the fact that the university did not have an official "quota" like other universities, and highlighted the fact that they did not ask about ethnicity or religion on applications. However, it was clear that admissions primarily used student enrollment at high density Jewish schools, and other supporting information like father's occupation, mother's name, and required headshots, as a proxy that an applicant was Jewish. Despite consistent and convincing claims that the university was discriminating against Jewish applicants and students, the report notes that the university continued to mislead alumni, the Anti-Defamation League, at least one trustee, and faculty.
The first institutional apology was issued in a public letter from the current president of Stanford, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, shortly after the publication of the task report in 2022. Tessier-Lavigne apologized on behalf of the university for discriminating against Jewish students in addition to denying and dismissing claims for decades thereafter and committed to taking steps to enhance Jewish students' experience at Stanford. Rabbi Jessica Kirschner, executive director of Hillel at Stanford, said in an email that "for the people who knew there was something wrong despite official denials, hearing the symbolic head of the university speak the truth out loud and apologize is validating, and maybe even healing." She added that the university's response is an example of what institutional apologies can and should look like, noting how "a new generation of Stanford leadership took evidence seriously, commissioned a strong task force, and did not flinch when its findings did not reflect well on the institution." Others, including President Alyza Lewin of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, praised the university for acknowledging the mistakes of its past, but also urged the university to acknowledge the discrimination and harassment that Jewish students continue to experience at Stanford.
From 2019 to 2021, Stanford's Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS) division was the subject of allegations regarding a culture of anti-Semitism. In December 2019, CAPS announced the formation of a Diversity Education and Inclusion (DEI) committee made up of CAPS staff and that it would begin weekly DEI seminars. In January 2020, CAPS set up separate "affinity groups" based on race, intended to help staff understand cultural and racial groups and biases. One affinity group was designated for white people and the other for people of color. Rather than create a group for people of Jewish ancestry where members could discuss their lived Jewish experience, CAPS instead pressured Jewish employees to join the white affinity group – despite the fact that 12-15% of Jews in America identify as Jews of color.
In May 2020, Zoom-bombers hijacked a Stanford University townhall and broadcast racist messages, displayed images of swastikas and weapons, and made use of the N-Word. The CAPS DEI group omitted mention of anti-Semitism in its post-mortem of the incident. A CAPS committee member explained: "the DEI committee decided to omit any mention of anti-Semitism so as not to dominate the discussion about anti-Black racism."
In July 2020, swastikas were found inside of Stanford's Memorial Church. At a DEI seminar following the swastikas' discovery, Dr. Ronald Albucher, a Jewish CAPS employee, asked that the DEI program discuss the incident at one of their weekly meetings. The DEI facilitators said they would discuss it only if time allowed, and ultimately there was no discussion or official mention of the anti-Semitic incident. In January 2021, CAPS diversity trainers said that they take an anti-Zionist approach to social justice, and they described Jews as connected to white supremacy.
Dr. Albucher and his colleague Sheila Levin, another Jewish CAPS employee, filed official complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) through the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law. The EEOC opened an investigation based on the complaint. On January 10, 2022, EEOC Commissioner Andrea Lucas called the allegations within the complaint "deeply troubling".
In the days following the October 7 attacks, a Stanford instructor was removed from teaching duties after it was reported that he claimed the attacks were justified, singled out Jewish students in his class, and downplayed the Holocaust. Stanford's leadership was criticized for not unequivocally condemning terrorism and antisemitism.
Tufts.
Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) launched a campaign against U.S.-Israel police partnerships at Tufts University in 2018 after a Freedom of Information Act request revealed that a former police officer at Tufts participated in a "military training trip" to Israel.
In November 2020, SJP introduced a referendum for the student election ballot to show Tufts administrators that students did not support alleged militarization of Tufts University Police Department (TUPD), sending officers to train in Israel or with any military bodies, and against the hiring of officers who have participated in such programs. In addition to submitting this referendum to students, they also presented it to the Tufts Community Union Judiciary (TCUJ), a seven-member group that is tasked with fact checking and removing bias from student government legislation.
TCUJ member Max Price expressed concern, stating that the campaign and referendum rested on mistruths. Price's research showed the law enforcement exchange programs are not military trips, as written in the initial referendum, and that the event contained no training or military meetings with active military officials in Israel. He cited that all previous participating Palestinian and Israeli officers described the event as an educational seminar hosted by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). Price clarified that it was the ADL who invited and sponsored the Tufts officer, not that the university had sent them as mentioned in the referendum. And Price showed how the initial referendum submitted called for discrimination against veterans, a protected class. On these fact-based premises, Price asserted that the referendum needed to be amended before it could be approved, and all members of the TCUJ agreed.
After these critiques, SJP asked for Price to be excluded from the vote and discussion due to alleged bias related to him being Jewish and Pro Israel. Price refused to recuse himself from decisions on the referendum. Student government officials interviewed Price for two hour-long sessions to evaluate his personal beliefs, identity, and alleged bias. Their conclusion was that Price had not shown any bias during the TCUJ deliberations and that his critiques of the referendum language had all been fact-based. The TCUJ student government participants determined there was no need for Mr. Price to recuse himself.
SJP continued its demand that the Chair of TCUJ remove Mr. Price from the TCUJ's consideration of the referendum language. SJP filed a complaint against Price demanding his impeachment and removal from TCUJ. In response to SJP's continued pressure, the TCUJ Chair silenced Mr. Price by requiring him to remain "on mute" for the entire TCUJ Zoom meeting held on November 18, 2020, a decision he was not informed of until after the meeting had already started. Members of the Tufts Community Union Senate made anti-Semitic statements and "demonstrate[d] personal bias against Price", and later threatened him with a disciplinary hearing and removal from TCUJ.
Price reported these incidents to the Tufts University administration but did not receive an adequate response. Price reached out to the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law for legal assistance. The Brandeis Center represented Price and wrote a letter to Tufts University President Anthony P. Monaco. This letter urged the university to stop the upcoming hearing because these actions were in violation of Price's right to freedom of speech and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Ultimately, the hearing was canceled. Tufts University officials did not issue any public statements condemning TCUJ actions against Price or the university's position on the hearing.
Forty two percent of the student population voted on this referendum, which was reported as the highest recorded voter turnout of any "special election" in Tufts history. The referendum passed with 68% of students voting. The Tufts administration did not respond to the demands of this referendum.
University of California, Berkeley.
On August 21, 2022, Berkeley Law Student for Justice in Palestine (Berkeley LSJP) announced nine student organizations adopted a "pro-Palestine bylaw" and vowed not to "invite speakers that have expressed and continued to hold views or host/sponsor/promote events in support of Zionism, the apartheid state of Israel, and the occupation of Palestine." Berkeley Law Muslim Student Association, Middle Eastern and North African Law Students Association, Womxn of Color Collective, Asian Pacific American Law Students Association, Queer Caucus, Community Defense Project, Women of Berkeley Law, and Law Students of African Descent were among the student organizations who signed the Law Students for Justice in Palestine at Berkeley Law pledge. This pledge supported the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and called for the suppression of pro-Israel and pro-Zionist rhetoric.
Former Assistant U.S. Secretary of Education for Civil Rights; Staff Director at the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; General Deputy Assistant U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity; and current Chairman of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law Kenneth L. Marcus authored an op-ed in the Jewish Journal about the bylaw, titled: "Berkeley Develops Jewish-Free Zones." The article went viral and attracted national attention to the campus conflict. In an interview, Mr. Marcus, a Berkeley law school alumnus, said that he was contacted by law students there who were concerned about the bylaw. He said he spent weeks trying to support them and wrote his article after Berkeley did not "rectify the problem." Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Barbra Streisand both tweeted about the article.
Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky described the bylaw as anti-Semitic, but defended his decision not to disband or punish the student groups by stating "it is important to recognize that law student groups have free speech rights, including to express messages that I and others might find offensive."
Numerous organizations and institutions have shared concerns regarding the Law school's bylaws. Attorneys Arsen Ostrovsky and Gabriel Groisman filed a complaint in November 2022 with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964[SP1]. OCR opened a formal investigation in December 2022. [SP2] Since August, StandWithUs and others have called on law firms to stop funding anti-Semitic Berkeley Law student groups.
University of California, Los Angeles.
In April 2024, anti-Israel students at UCLA established a campus encampment during the ongoing Israel-Hamas War. The university provided the encampment with private security and metal barricades “to prevent violent confrontations between... protesters.” Ultimately, however, the anti-Israel protestors did not allow students who refused to denounce Israel onto UCLA campus grounds, which was viewed as a “Jew Exclusion Zone” by many students on campus. UCLA did not prevent the misuse of their resources that were used to deny Jewish students access to Royce Quad, a central part of UCLA's campus.
In June 2024, three Jewish students filed a lawsuit against UCLA, alleging “that the university played a role in preventing them from accessing the campus freely during protests, when they were blocked from entering the pro-Palestinian encampment erected by protesters.” The students were represented by Becket Law. In July 2024, a federal judge ordered that UCLA must “create a plan to ensure Jewish students have equal access to campus” as a result of the lawsuit.
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Following a wave of anti-Israeli and at times antisemitic protests and events on campus following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, the Anti Defamation League gave in April 2024 UNC Chapel Hill the grade "F" in its "Campus Antisemitism Report Card".
University of Pennsylvania.
In December 2023, two Jewish students filed a lawsuit against the University of Pennsylvania, alleging discrimination against Jewish individuals on its campuses. The students asserted that the university violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing to address a "hostile environment" on campus. Despite the lawsuit being prompted by a rise in antisemitism following the October 7, 2023 attacks, it references incidents predating the attack. One of the incidents mentioned in the suit occurred on October 9, two days after the Hamas attack, where a student wearing a Star of David was identified as Jewish by a group of pro-Palestine protestors. One of them verbally harassed her with anti-Semitic remarks, shouting, "You are a dirty Jew, don't look at us." The case docket details over 100 incidents of antisemitism on campus since 2015.
University of Vermont.
In 2021, the Anti-Defamation League reported that the University of Vermont had the highest number of reported anti-Semitic incidents. In the same year, The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and Jewish on Campus filed a complaint against the University of Vermont alleging that the university fostered a hostile environment for Jewish students, and did not respond adequately to anti-Semitic incidents. The complaint argued that students were excluded from organizations on campus for being Jewish, students threw rocks at a dorm that housed Jewish students, and that a teaching assistant bragged on social media about subtracting participation points from Jewish students. Initially, the university attempted to push back against the allegations of anti-Semitism; university President Suresh Garimella stated that “the uninformed narrative published this week has been harmful to UVM” and that the investigation “painted our community in a patently false light.”
In April 2023, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) identified areas of concern within the university's policies that “...have allowed a hostile environment for...Jewish students to persist at the university." OCR officials noted that “it does not appear that the university...took action...until after the commencement of OCR's investigation." The university agreed to settle the complaint, resolving to edit their discrimination and harassment policies and provide extra training to staff and students “on the prohibition of harassment based on national ancestry." “In the wake of a landmark settlement with the federal government, there has been a remarkable evolution in visible support for Jewish students,” stated UVM Hillel Executive Director Matt Vogel.
In May 2023, over 150 university faculty members signed an open letter calling on President Garimella to “provide an accurate account of what transpired that led to the (Office of Civil Rights) investigation.”
Causes.
Anti-Semitism at universities during the 19th through 20th centuries has been explained in terms of racism, xenophobia, psychological projection, and scapegoating. More recently, in the 21st century, Suzanna Sherry has argued that the establishment and proliferation of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) offices has directly contributed to anti-Semitism at American universities.

Stigmatines

The Stigmatines, officially named the Congregation of the Sacred Stigmata (), is a Catholic clerical religious congregation of Pontifical Right for men (Priests and Brothers). The Stigmatine Congregation was founded on November 4, 1816 by Gaspar Bertoni, in Verona, Italy. Its members use the post-nominals C.S.S..
History.
The first written constitutions for the congregation were based on the constitutions of the Society of Jesus, a religious order founded by Ignatius of Loyola. Like the Jesuits, the congregation was intended as a missionary and educational ministry. The church where the Stigmatines were founded in Verona, Italy, was dedicated to the Stigmata of St. Francis of Assisi, from which the original title of the Community came. The patrons of the Stigmatine Congregation are the Holy Spouses, Mary and Joseph. The community's patronal feast is January 23, the Espousals of Mary and Joseph.
The growth of the community was slow. In 1905, the Stigmatines went to the United States in 1907, and in 1910, they started activities in Brazil. For nearly two centuries, the Stigmatines worked in China, Thailand, the Philippines and various countries in Africa and Latin America.
In 2002, the Stigmatines settled in India.
In June 2018, the city council of Waltham, Massachusetts, voted to take the 46 acres owned by the Stigmatines by eminent domain, for the purpose of building a new high school. The site includes the Espousal Retreat Center, a conference center, and a retirement home for priests. Mayor Jeannette McCarthy stated that the property is valued at $25.4 million; the city is offering $18 million. A statement on the Stigmatines' website states, "No one is doubting or discounting the need for a new high school in Waltham. We just don't believe the City should be able to end our existence here in Waltham because it covets our land for its own use." In December 2019, the parties resolved their dispute by the city council agreeing to pay a total of $29 million for the site.
In the Philippines, on 8 September 2021, Jessie Avenido (30 years old), Jestonie Avenido (29 years old) and Jerson Rey Avenido (28 years old), three brothers, members of the congregation, were ordained priests by archbishop Jose Cabantan in the Cathedral of Cagayan de Oro.

Reliance-Majestic Studios

Reliance-Majestic Studios was an early American movie studio in Hollywood, California, originally built around 1914 at 4516 Sunset Boulevard.
Within a few years, it became the home of D. W. Griffith and Mutual Film Corporation. The studio's name was changed to Fine Arts Studios, and was sometimes known as the Griffith Studio or the Griffith Artcraft Studio. The studio was formed by Mutual as a partnership between D. W. Griffith and Majestic Studio owner Harry Aitken.
"The Birth of a Nation" (1915), "Hearts of the World" (1918) and "Broken Blossoms" (1919) were partially or fully lensed at the studio. The sets for "Intolerance" (1916) were erected across the street where the Vista Theatre stands.
In 1915, Thomas Ince's Kay-Bee Pictures, Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios, and D. W. Griffith's Reliance-Majestic studio were combined to form the Triangle Film Corporation, which was headed by Harry and Roy Aitken.
In 1927, Tiffany Pictures acquired the lot. Upon Tiffany's bankruptcy in 1932, the stages were renamed Talisman studios and used as a rental studio by a variety of studios such as Monogram Pictures.
The lot (now with the address 4520 Sunset Boulevard) is currently the location of a Vons supermarket.

José Luis López Vázquez

José Luis López Vázquez de la Torre (11 March 1922 – 2 November 2009) was a Spanish actor, comedian, costume designer, scenic designer, and assistant director whose career spanned nearly seven decades. He was one of the most prolific and successful actors in Spain in the 20th century, starring in 262 films between 1946 and 2007. Internationally he was best known for his lead role in the surrealist horror telefilm "La cabina" (1972). 
Born in Madrid of working-class parents, López Vázquez began his career on theatre in 1939 as a costume designer and set decorator before making his breakthrough as an actor. In the mid-1940s he switched over to film, where he continued his work in costume designs while serving as an assistant director. Throughout the 1950s he mostly played bit parts in the Spanish film industry, however, his comedic talent soon allowed him to get bigger roles, cultivating an image as Spain's on-screen everyman in numerous comedies during the Franco era and beyond. Around the 1960s he also revealed his ability to play dramatic roles. 
At one point in his career he became part of a distinctive Spanish art cinema led primarily by directors Luis García Berlanga, Juan Antonio Bardem, Carlos Saura and screenwriter Rafael Azcona. He played important roles in several films by Berlanga ("Plácido", 1961, "El Verdugo", 1963, "La escopeta nacional", 1978, "Patrimonio nacional", 1981, "Nacional III", 1982) and Saura ("Peppermint Frappé", 1967, "The Garden of Delights", 1970, "Cousin Angelica", 1974), which gained international attention. He won two consecutives Best Actor awards at the Chicago International Film Festival for "The Ancines Woods" in 1971 and "My Dearest Senorita" in 1972. He had the opportunity to occasionally collaborate with renowned foreign filmmakers such as Marco Ferreri ("El Pisito", 1959, "El Cochecito", 1960) and George Cukor ("Travels with My Aunt", 1972).
He was the recipient of numerous accolades, including four CEC Awards, two Fotogramas de Plata, two Sant Jordi Awards, two New York Latin ACE Awards, an Antena de Oro, and a TP de Oro. He earned the at the Valladolid International Film Festival in 1989, the Actors and Actresses Union Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000, the National Theatre Award in 2002, the Honorary Goya Award in 2004, and the in 2005. The Government of Spain honoured him with the Gold Medal of Merit in the Fine Arts in 1985 and the Gold Medal of Merit in Labour in 1997.
Early life.
José Luis López Vázquez was born in Madrid, Spain, on 11 March 1922. The only son of Margarita Vázquez de la Torre, a dressmaker, and Luis López, who worked as an official of the Ministry of Justice. In some biographies he appears as born on 12 March. "With the nerves of the event, my father forgot to register me and he did it the next day" he said. His father also forgot to give the official the name he chose for the baby. And he had to return to his brother José. The offices were already closed and they had to return a day later. He was registered with the nicknames of both. His parents separated when he was very young, causing them to go through difficulties and financial problems. As a teenager he was force to leave his studies and work as an administrative assistant and typist, a period that he began to overcome due to his ability in drawing and painting.
Career.
Early artistic work.
In 1939, at the age of 17, he became interested in theatre through the Youth Front and entered in the (TEU) directed by . There he outlined his vocation as a draughtsman thanks to the painter José Caballero, who had been part of the group "La Barraca" led by Federico García Lorca. He originally worked as a scenic designer for the sets of the Theatre of María Guerrero in times of Luis Escobar Kirkpatrick, as well as an assistant director to Pío Ballesteros and Enrique Herreros. The playwright and filmmaker José López Rubio had a decisive influence on his artistic side when he hired him as a costume designer for three films: "It Happened in Damascus" (1943), "Eugenia de Montijo" (1944) and "Alhucemas" (1948). Some of the theatrical productions for which he created costume designs in the 1940s and 1950s are "Don Juan Tenorio", where he met Salvador Dalí in 1949, "The Phantom Lady", "The Village of Stepanchikovo", "El caballero de Olmedo", "La guardia cuidadosa", a drawing of "Don Gil of the Green Breeches", and five sketches for the sets of "Life Is a Dream", "Y no subió a la cruz", and "The Dog in the Manger".
Acting.
Film and television.
In 1946, he made his film debut in Enrique Herreros' crime drama "María Fernanda, la Jerezana". A few years later he began a long-time collaboration with director Luis García Berlanga, giving him a small role in the 1951 comedy "That Happy Couple", co-directed by Juan Antonio Bardem. Shortly after, he made a part in Bardem's "" (1954), and Berlanga counted on him for two supporting roles in "Boyfriend in Sight" (1954), playing a nineteenth-century beach flirt, and "Miracles of Thursday" (1957), as a skeptical priest. He acted in many comedy films in these years, including "Los tramposos" (1959), directed by Pedro Lazaga, which showed the city of Madrid at the time and some of its most popular scams.
López Vázquez was given the chance to be appreciated abroad for the first time by the Italian director Marco Ferreri, with whom he shot his first starring role in "El Pisito" (1959), an anti-bourgeois black comedy based on a 1957 novel by screenwriter Rafael Azcona, which is centred on Rodolfo (López Vázquez), a timid, middle-class man who marries a crotchety, dying octogenarian to inherit her apartment and eventually marry his fiancee Petrita (Mary Carrillo). In addition he starred in the short film "", a social critique with an anti-clerical point that was co-written by Berlanga and Azcona. The following year he appeared in Ferreri's "El Cochecito" (1960), with Pepe Isbert in the lead role in a sardonic study of geriatric revolt. The film won the FIPRESCI Prize at the Venice Film Festival. All these films were oblique critiques of Franco's totalitarian regime.
In the early 1960s he worked on two Berlanga's savage satires: "Plácido" (1961), nominated to the Academy Award as Best Foreign Language Film in 1962, where López Vázquez shined in the role as Gabino Quintanilla, an event organizer without moral principles. His performance was acclaimed in the Sant Jordi Awards as Best Actor. And the classic Spanish film "El Verdugo" (The Executioner, 1963), playing an eccentric tailor who is brother of the main character (Nino Manfredi). He portrayed relevant comic roles such as the godfather in "La gran familia" (1962), and as Fernando Galindo, a bank clerk who plans a robbery of his own bank with the help of other employees in José María Forqué's comedy "Atraco a las tres" (Robbery at 3 o'clock, 1962). The character's quote "Fernando Galindo, un admirador, un amigo, un esclavo, un siervo" ("Fernando Galindo, an admirer, a friend, a slave, a servant") would become essential within Spanish culture. The movie co-starred the Spanish actress Gracita Morales, which he formed a popular partnership in such comedies as Pedro Lazaga's "Sor Citroën" (1967), and Mariano Ozores' "Operation Mata Hari" (1968). Together with Paco Martínez Soria he also stars in Lazaga's 1968 film "", one of the most representative comedies of the construction boom in the 60s in Spain.
In 1967 he played his first dramatic role in Carlos Saura's psychological thriller "Peppermint Frappé", as a physician becoming obsessively infatuated with his childhood friend's attractive wife (Geraldine Chaplin); he won the CEC Award for Best Actor awarded by the Círculo de Escritores Cinematográficos (Cinema Writers Circle) in 1968. Both comedy and drama, his performances were usually marked by solitary and repressed characters. Then he chained a series of major projects, starting when director Pedro Olea chose him for the lead role in the 1970 horror film "El Bosque del Lobo" (The Ancines Woods), in which he was the epilectic peddler Benito Freire (based on Spanish serial killer Manuel Blanco Romasanta), who, due a childhood trauma, periodically suffered from an irresistible urge to strangle women. That performance earned him the Best Actor honour at the Chicago International Film Festival in 1971. This was followed by Berlanga's 1970 black comedy "Long Live the Bride and Groom", as a man about to get married when his mother appear dead in the pool shortly before the ceremony, and his second collaboration with Saura in "The Garden of Delights" (1970), as a ruthless tycoon, catatonic and paralysed in a wheelchair after a car accident, who holds the key to his family's fortune. His role was described by critic Roger Greenspun of "The New York Times" as "hilarious" and "pathetic" and even "terrifying".
By the 1970s he was a firmly established figure in Spanish cinema, appearing in eleven films in 1972, including Jaime de Armiñán's Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film-nominee "My Dearest Senorita", which he would win the Best Actor Silver Hugo for a second year in a row at the Chicago Film Festival for his complex role as Adela Castro Molina/Juan, a woman who discovers that "she" is a man, and Antonio Mercero's International Emmy Awards-winning television film "La cabina", a psychological horror story about a man (López Vázquez) trapped in a telephone booth filmed by Televisión Española (TVE); López Vázquez won the Antena de Oro, the Fotogramas de Plata, and the Latin ACE Award for his performance. In this decade he participated in the international film productions "The Legend of Frenchie King" (1971), a western comedy directed by Christian-Jaque and starring Claudia Cardinale and Brigitte Bardot, and George Cukor's American comedy "Travels with My Aunt" (1972), which he co-starred opposite Dame Maggie Smith as M. Dambreuse, her wealthy former French lover. After the film was completed, Cukor invited him to Hollywood, proposing that he learn English to become a star, but López Vázquez declined the offer.
He collaborated again with Olea in the 1973 thriller "No es bueno que el hombre esté solo", as a widowed man living with a life-size doll whose secret is discovered by a new neighbour (Carmen Sevilla). The same year he starred in Manuel Gutiérrez Aragón's drama "Habla, mudita", as Ramiro, a linguist who is fascinated by a young mute shepherdess (Kiti Mánver). Later he performed in Saura's "Cousin Angelica" (1974), winner of the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, in which he is a middle-aged bachelor who finds, on his return to Barcelona after many years away, that the cousin he loved as a child is now married to a fascist. Critic Vincent Canby said he was "super" in the part. He also played an old Antoni Gaudí in a 45-minute uneven film directed by John Alaimo that was unreleased until 2009 called " (1974).
In the next years he continued working with regularity in films and television, notably in Mercero's television series ' (1975–1976), as Sixto Zabaleta, a bench jeweler who represents the most archaic and outdated values of the Spanish society, Pedro Masó's comedy drama ' (1979), which he starred alongside Jane Birkin as a schoolteacher who is attracted to the young mother of a student (Jorge Sanz), the film based on Eduardo Mendoza Garriga's 1975 novel " (1980), as Domingo 'Pajarito' de Soto, a journalist who investigates the violent death of a worker at the Savolta weapons factory, and Berlanga's trilogy "La escopeta nacional" (1978), "Patrimonio nacional" (1981) and "Nacional III" (1982), performing a marquis of the aristocratic Leguineche family in a satire on the powers of Franco's regime.
Other film appearances in the 1980s include Mario Camus' Golden Bear-winning film "The Beehive" (1982), based on the 1950 novel by Camilo José Cela in which he plays an ex-Communist scratching out an existence in Francoist Spain, Olea's period drama "Akelarre" (1984), portraying an inquisitor, "The Court of the Pharaoh" (José Luis García Sánchez, 1985), as a bumbling police inspector, "" (de Armiñán, 1987), for which he won a second Latin ACE Award in 1989, the comedy "Moors and Christians" (Berlanga, 1987), as a shameless man who drags an entire family into a delirious odyssey in which they come across grotesque characters, the antimilitarist tragicomedy "The Little Spanish Soldier" (Antonio Giménez-Rico, 1988), and the historical film "Esquilache" (Josefina Molina, 1989), as Antonio Campos, the secretary of Leopoldo de Gregorio, 1st Marquess of Esquilache (Fernando Fernán Gómez).
In 1989, the Valladolid International Film Festival (Seminci) commemorated his career by awarding him the in its 34th edition.
From the 1990s, López Vázquez slowed down and did mostly supporting work in "The Long Winter" (Jaime Camino, 1992), "The Fencing Master" (Olea, 1992), as the inspector Jenaro Campillo in a film based on the 1988 novel of the same name by Arturo Pérez-Reverte, the comedy "Everyone Off to Jail" (Berlanga, 1993), as a priest who pretends to be a socialist, the fantasy thriller "Memorias del ángel caído" (David Alonso, Fernando Cámara, 1997), the action comedy "" (Santiago Segura, 2001), in a cameo appearance as a client of José Luis Torrente, "Moscow Gold" (Jesús Bonilla, 2003), the Argentine comedy-drama "Moon of Avellaneda" (Juan José Campanella, 2004), as the elderly Don Aquiles, and "And Who Are You?"

On 30 January 2005, he received the Honorary Goya Award at the 19th Goya Awards ceremony for his lifetime achievement, which had the longest standing ovation of the evening, dedicating his distinction primarily to the public.
Theatre.
López Vázquez developed his stage career in the theatres of Madrid. In 1943 he was in the cast of "El casamiento engañoso", at the Theatre of María Guerrero. Although cinema kept him away from theatre for almost three decades, he returned to it regularly at the end of the 20th century. Among the stage productions in which he starred: Charles Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop", 1947; Lope de Vega's "La dama boba", 1951; André Roussin's "Bobosse", 1953; Pietro Garinei's "Buonanotte Bettina", 1958; Alexandre Dumas' "Kean", 1958; "Cartas credenciales", 1960; Alfonso Paso's "Los Palomos", 1964; Murray Schisgal's "Luv", 1967; Peter Shaffer's "Equus", 1976; in the lead role as the psychiatrist Martin Dysart, Fermín Cabal's "Vade Retro!", 1982; Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman", 1985; which won critical praise for his performance as Willy Loman, Santiago Moncada's "Cena para dos", 1991, and Neil Simon's "The Sunshine Boys", 1997. His portrayal as Julius Caesar in George Bernard Shaw's play "Caesar and Cleopatra" at the in 2001 received public acclaim. In 2002, the Spanish Ministry of Culture awarded him the National Theatre Prize "for his extraordinary quality as a tragicomic actor throughout a long artistic career, which is still present today on our stages". His last theatrical performance was in the 2004 play "Tres hombres y un destino".
Personal life, death and legacy.
In 1951 he was married with the actress , but the couple were unable to have offspring. He later get into an eighteen-year relationship with Katty Magerus although they could not marry due to the lack of divorce. They had two children, José Luis (b. 1962), and Virginia (b. 1965), who died in the United States in 1994. He also had two other daughters with the journalist Flor Aguilar, named Cayetana and Camino. In his latter years he had a relationship with the actress Carmen de la Maza. He amassed a great fortune due to his work in cinema and lived in a duplex of 400 square meters on Paseo de la Castellana of the Spanish capital.
López Vázquez died of natural causes in Madrid on 2 November 2009, at the age of 87. After his death, several tributes were paid to him, among them Álex de la Iglesia, president of the Spanish Film Academy, who said, "One of the greatest actors is gone, one of the legs of the table of great Spanish cinema along with Fernando Fernán Gómez and Pepe Isbert". The actor and filmmaker Santiago Segura stated that his death represents "the end of an era". His coffin was installed at the Theatre of María Guerrero, headquarters of the national theatre company Centro Dramático Nacional (CDN), which was attended by figures such as actresses Carmen Sevilla and Verónica Forqué, film director Pedro Almodóvar, the mayor of Madrid Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón, and the Prince and Princess of Asturias. He was later cremated in the Almudena Cemetery in Madrid.
In 2010, his biography was posthumously published under the title "¿Para qué te cuento?: biografía autorizada de José Luis López Vázquez", written by Luis Lorente, who claimed that López Vázquez "belongs to a generation of extraordinary actors who have no replacement". In the same year, the Cultural Centre José Luis López Vázquez was opened in the San Blas-Canillejas district in Madrid, and on 6 July, Correos, the Spanish postal service, issued a sheet of stamps in tribute to him as part of its Spanish cinema series.
In 2022 it was released the documentary "", directed by Roberto J. Oltra and sponsored by the actor's son, José Luis López Magerus, to commemorate his 100th birth anniversary, which explores the reasons for his success throughout his career. On 10 March, a silhouette was placed on the monument of "La cabina" installed in Madrid to remember his performance in the television film.
In 2024, the Cultural Space Serrería Belga (Medialab Matadero) is presenting the exhibition "José Luis before López Vázquez", showing the lesser-known facets of the actor. Through approximately one hundred pieces, it shows his work as a draughtsman, costume designer, and set designer, without neglecting his acting career and his more personal side, including little-known pieces from his private life. The exhibition also focuses on his facet as an art collector, which shows for the first time some of the works he collected over the years. These include works by Maruja Mallo (La sorpresa del trigo), Salvador Dalí (Cabeza de Gala), Antoni Tàpies (Jazz), Alberto Sánchez Pérez (Pájaro bebiendo agua), Antonio Saura (Ancestro 5), Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo (Pequeño esquema para...), Juan Manuel Díaz-Caneja (Naturaleza muerta), Benjamín Palencia (Boceto para La Barraca), Edgar Neville (Quai de la Seine), a drawing by José Caballero from 1936 and two drawings by Federico García Lorca from 1935.

Eagle Harbor Light

Eagle Harbor Light is an operational lighthouse at Eagle Harbor, in Keweenaw County in the state of Michigan. It sits on the rocky entrance to Eagle Harbor and is one of several light stations that guide mariners on Lake Superior across the northern edge of the Keweenaw Peninsula. The original lighthouse, built in 1851, was replaced in 1871 by the present red brick structure, which is a Michigan State Historic Site and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
Edward Taylor was the first to realize the commercial potential of Eagle Harbor, building a short timber pier in the bay in 1844 from which to supply the growing number of miners in the area. A rocky ledge with only eight feet of water above it spread across the harbor entry, and represented a barrier to vessels of deep draft. However, the copper boom saw an increasing number of vessels visiting the dock, and Taylor began to lobby for federal funding for improving the entry into the harbor.
The original Eagle Harbor Light was built in 1851. The structure took the form of a rubble stone keeper's dwelling with a square white-painted wooden tower integrated into one end of the roof. The tower was capped with an octagonal wooden lantern with multiple glass panes, and outfitted with an array of Lewis lamps with reflectors. With the lamps standing above the dwelling's foundation, the building's location on high ground placed the lamps at a focal plane of above lake level.
By 1865, a total of four new Keepers had worked at the station, with two of them removed from office, one resigning, and one passing away after only seven months at the station. The structure was deteriorating and was replaced in 1871 using a design that had previously been used for Chambers Island Lighthouse in Wisconsin; and McGulpin Point Light in 1868. It was thereafter used at White River Light in 1875; and Sand Island Light (Wisconsin) in 1881. The octagonal brick light tower is ten feet in diameter, with walls thick and it supports a 10-sided cast iron lantern. The Lighthouse was manned by a head keeper and two assistant keepers.
In 1999 the Congress of the United States transferred ownership of the Eagle Harbor Light Station to the Keweenaw County Historical Society. The Coast Guard continues to operate the light at the top of the tower.
Museums.
The Keweenaw County Historical Society operates the lighthouse as a museum, and also operates other museums at the site, including the Maritime Museum in the old fog signal building, the Commercial Fishing Museum, the Keweenaw History Museum and an exhibit on the 1926 shipwreck of the City of Bangor.

AlgaeBase

AlgaeBase is a global species database of information on all groups of algae, both marine and freshwater, as well as sea-grass.
History.
AlgaeBase began in March 1996, founded by Michael Guiry.
By 2005, the database contained about 65,000 names.
In 2013, AlgaeBase and the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) signed an end-user license agreement regarding the Electronic Intellectual Property of AlgaeBase. This allows the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) to include taxonomic names of algae in WoRMS, thereby allowing WoRMS, as part of the Aphia database, to make its overview of all described marine species more complete. Synchronisation of the AlgaeBase data with Aphia and WoRMS was undertaken manually until March 2015, but this was very time-consuming, so an online application was developed to semi-automate the synchronisation, launching in 2015 in conjunction with Michael Guiry and the chief programmer of AlgaeBase, Pier Kuipers. After a long phase of further development and testing, the AlgaeBase harvester tool was implemented by the WoRMS data management team in early 2019. Since then, newly-added species in AlgaeBase are added to Aphia and, if marine, to WoRMS as well.
Description.
The database is hosted at the National University of Ireland's Ryan Institute, in Galway. It includes about all types of algae, as well as one group of flowering plants, the sea-grasses. Information about each species' taxonomy, nomenclature and distribution is included, and the algae covered include terrestrial as well as marine and freshwater species, such as seaweeds, phytoplankton, and freshwater algae. , marine species have the best coverage, including sea-grasses.
As of 2014 there were nearly 17,000 images, and the database was being used by 2,000–3,000 individual visitors each day.
As of 2023, there were about 170,000 species and infraspecies in AlgaeBase.
Support and funding.
The compilation of the data was funded by the Irish Government Department of Education and Science's Programme for Research in Third-level Institutions (PRTLI) 2, 3 and 4 programmes, to the Ryan Institute and the Environmental Change Institute, as well as by Atlantic Philanthropies, and the European Union.
The synchronisation between AlgaeBase and Aphia was possible through support of the LifeWatch Species Information Backbone. LifeWatch, the E-Science European Infrastructure for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research, is a distributed virtual laboratory, which is used for different aspects of biodiversity research.
, the main sponsors of the database are the Phycological Society of America, the British Phycological Society, the International Phycological Society, and the Korean Phycological Society. Programming is carried out by Pier Kuipers and Caoilte Guiry, and Michael Guiry. Jonathan Guthrie was responsible for programming much of earlier versions.

Mattersey Priory

Mattersey Priory is a former monastery of the Gilbertine Order, located near the village of Mattersey, Nottinghamshire, England. It is managed by English Heritage.
History.
The priory was founded by Roger FitzRalph (son of Ranulph de Mattersey) in around 1185, and was dedicated to St Helen. It was constructed on a gravel island in the River Idle, and the area surrounding would have been mostly marshland at the time. The priory was designed to be home to six canons of the Gilbertine Order, although it could accommodate up to ten canons. Unlike many other Gilbertine priories, Mattersey was not a "mixed-house"; it was home to only canons (male), and not to canonesses (female).
The priory's church was destroyed by fire in 1279 and not rebuilt.
The priory is described as "never prosperous". In 1291, it was recorded as having an income of £52. The 1534 Valor Ecclesiasticus records the priory's income as £61 16s. 7d. with a clear annual value of £55 2s. 5d. One possession was the church at Misson, Nottinghamshire.
In 1403, King Henry IV granted the priory permission to hold a weekly Monday market at Mattersey. He also gave permission to hold annual fairs on St John of Beverley's day (7 May) and St Simon and St Jude's day (28 October).
The priory was dissolved as part of King Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. It was surrendered on 3 October 1538 by Robert Holgate, Bishop of Llandaff; the Prior, Thomas Norman; the sub-prior, Thomas Bell; and by the three canons: John Garton, William Schylton, and Richard Watson. The following year the former Prior was awarded an annual pension of £12 the sub-prior £2 13s. 4d., and each of the canons 40s.
In 1539, the priory and its estate were given to Anthony Nevill. Around the year 1605, Mrs Margaret Nevill wrote to Lady Ann Holles at Haughton, inviting her to come and "visit the poor old Abbey of Mattersley".
The site was taken under the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works in 1912, and is currently managed by English Heritage.
Description.
The priory church is described as "a short, narrow, rectangular, aisleless building, without transepts". To the north stood a tower which was built in the 15th century. To the south of the church was the cloisters: a covered passageway around a courtyard, which was in turn surrounded by ranges of buildings on three sides. The eastern range of the cloisters was built after the fire of 1279. The ground floor consisted of a single vaulted room. This was subdivided to form a chapel, chapter house, and a day or warming room. Above was the "dorter" or "sleeping quarters" with the reredorter (communal toilet) at the end of the building. The southern range of the cloisters was slightly larger than the east, but had two stories again: the ground floor was an under-croft whilst the upper floor was occupied by the "frater" or refectory, where the canons ate. The west range was originally the lay-brothers accommodation (refectory on the ground-floor, sleeping quarters above). However, it is thought to have been converted into accommodation for the Prior. To the South-West was a square building housing the monastic kitchens.
Remains.
The ruins of the priory sit next to the River Idle, east of the village of Mattersey. The ruins consist mainly of foundations but also include the remains of the 12th-century priory church, three arches from the canon's refectory, the foundations of the 14th-century monastic kitchens and the remains of a 15th-century tower. The foundations of the monastic service buildings (barns, bakehouse, infirmary etc.) are thought to remain under the area currently occupied by the farm buildings and yards of the adjacent Abbey Farm.
In 1914, a partial excavation located the buried foundations of the cloister's east and south ranges. A small amount of restoration work was also undertaken during these excavations.

Käbi Laretei

Käbi Alma Laretei (14 July 1922 – 31 October 2014) was an Estonian-Swedish concert pianist.
Her father Heinrich Laretei was a diplomat in the service of the Republic of Estonia as ambassador to Sweden; when the Soviet Union occupied Estonia in 1940, the family did not return to Estonia. Her piano teacher was Maria-Luisa Strub-Moresco, who had an indirect influence on the artistic choices of Laretei's later husband, Ingmar Bergman. Laretei had a long and distinguished career as a pianist, and in the 1960s she played to packed halls in the United Kingdom, Sweden, West Germany, and the United States, including Carnegie Hall.
From 1950 to 1959, Laretei was married to Gunnar Staern, with whom she had a daughter, Linda (born 1955). Laretei is also known for her marriage to and professional collaborations with film director Ingmar Bergman; Laretei was his fourth wife. They met in the late 1950s, and were married in 1959. She introduced Bergman to a variety of music, some of which he would use in film scores. They divorced in 1969, though the marriage was effectively over by 1966. His 1961 film "Through a Glass Darkly" is dedicated to Laretei. They had a son, Daniel Bergman (born 1962), who is also a film director. Laretei worked with Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith.
She continued to play in concert and give musical consultations on the set of some of her former husband's films and even appears playing the piano in a scene of "Fanny and Alexander". She recorded piano passages that appear diegetically in Bergman's films, such as "Autumn Sonata" and "The Magic Flute". She took an early interest in the TV medium, hosted many programmes on literature and music on Swedish TV and, starting with "En bit jord" (1976; "A lump of earth"), published a number of books on life and music, the last being "Såsom i en översättning" (2004; "As in a translation", the title being a paraphrase on "Through a Glass Darkly" (Såsom i en spegel)). Moreover, she has been the subject of numerous television and film documentaries.
She was awarded Estonia's Order of the National Coat of Arms, 3rd Class in 1998.
She died on 31 October 2014 at the age of 92.

Fort Gratiot Light

Fort Gratiot Light , the first lighthouse in the state of Michigan, was constructed north of Fort Gratiot in 1825 by Lucius Lyon, who later became one of Michigan's first U.S. Senators.
The Fort Gratiot Light marks the entrance to the St. Clair River from Lake Huron (going south) in the southern portion of Michigan's Thumb. The light is still active and the grounds are an active Coast Guard facility, but it has recently been handed over to the Port Huron Museum. It is the oldest surviving lighthouse in Michigan. There is also a public beach and park on the property, known as Lighthouse Beach.
It is across the river from Point Edward Front Range Light.
History.
With the completion of the Erie Canal, traffic in the Great Lakes increased dramatically. Coal was being brought from Michigan, stone (and more timber) was being brought from Wisconsin and the entrance to the St. Clair River became a bottleneck. In 1823, Congress appropriated $3,500 to construct a light in "Michigan Territory" near Fort Gratiot.
The contract for construction of the lighthouse and keeper's dwelling was awarded to Captain Winslow Lewis of Massachusetts. Lewis was the inventor of the patented Lewis lamp, which the Fifth Auditor had universally adopted as the primary source of illumination in the nation's growing inventory of lighthouses. A staunch supporter and ally of the Fifth Auditor, Lewis had branched out into the business of lighthouse construction, and as the frequent low bidder, was being awarded a growing number of contracts to fulfill the nation's need for navigational aids on the East Coast.
Lewis sub-contracted the construction of the tower and keeper's dwelling that would become known as the "Fort Gratiot Light" to Daniel Warren of Rochester, New York. Work commenced on the structure, but appears to have been running far beyond the scope of the original bid, since Congress appropriated an additional $5,000 for the project's completion on April 2, 1825.
This original tower was tall.
Even with the major cost overrun, it became quickly apparent that the structure was both poorly designed and constructed. George McDougall, a former Detroit lawyer of some ill repute was selected as the light's first official keeper. McDougall's reports indicated that the stairs were so steep that they had to be climbed sideways, and the trapdoor into the lantern room was barely large enough for a man to squeeze through. While McDougall no doubt reported with truth on this situation, he was reputedly a short man with a weight in excess of 300 pounds, and as such hired an assistant to perform all of his tower work.
McDougall's concerns were supported when the tower was damaged during a storm in the fall of 1828, and later fell down. Congress reacted swiftly and appropriated $8,000 for a new tower in 1829. The new tower was 65 feet tall and 25' in diameter and it was outfitted with the Lewis lamp system (powered by whale oil) that was then the standard.
Soon after its establishment in 1852, the new US Lighthouse Board determined that the Lewis lamps universally accepted by the prior Pleasonton administration were significantly inferior to the French Fresnel lenses being adopted throughout the rest of the world. After conducting successful trials of the new lenses in a few East Coast lights, the Board decided to upgrade all lenses throughout the system. As a result, the Lewis lamps were removed from Fort Gratiot in 1857, and the tower was refitted with a fourth-order Fresnel lens, which had an intensity at least four times that of the old Lewis lamps.
In 1874, a brick duplex keeper's house was built.
As lake shipping continued to rise dramatically in the early second half of the century, it was determined that the Fort Gratiot Light needed further upgrading. To this end, in 1862 the government increased the height of the tower to , and the fourth-order Fresnel was replaced with a larger third-order lens, showing a fixed white light. The old fourth-order lens was taken to Saginaw and installed in the Saginaw River Lighthouse.
The fog signal building was added in 1900, and a Coast Guard facility was constructed on land south of the lighthouse complex in 1932. The two facilities merged in 1939.
The lighthouse currently has a DCB-224 aero beacon manufactured by the Carlisle &amp; Finch Company.
This lighthouse is the oldest lighthouse in Michigan still in active service.
Current status.
The light is listed on the National Historic Register, Reference #76001975. In 1971, the Michigan Historical Commission named Fort Gratiot Light a historic site
In 2004, the Port Huron U.S. Coast Guard station moved into a new headquarters adjacent to the light.
The Coast Guard closed the lighthouse to visitors in August 2008 due to deteriorating brickwork and falling debris. A structural assessment and repairs will take place before the tower can reopen to the public. Architects reported that almost $4 million would be required for a complete restoration. In 2009, these plans were jeopardized, when city council rejected a deed offered by the federal government because it found the financial requirements too burdensome. The St. Clair County Parks and Recreation department took over the lighthouse and grounds in September 2010 and reopened guided tours of the lighthouse in summer of 2012.
Getting there.
The Park is open daily from 7:00am to 10:00pm. Admission to the park grounds is free. Admission tickets are sold in the gift shop for tours of the station and tower. The park is located at 2800 Omar Street, in Port Huron.
When the grounds are closed to the public, there is a city park just north of the light with an excellent view from the beach. Returning from Canada to Port Huron on the Blue Water Bridge, this light can be seen on the righthand side of one's motor vehicle.

Trigonioidea is superfamily of medium-sized saltwater clams, marine bivalve molluscs. Within the fossil record the occurrence of this superfamily is widespread, ranging from the Devonian Period to Recent.
The diagnostic feature for the superfamily is the unique and complex dentition of the shell, (i.e. the interior hinge teeth that articulate the two valves). The dentition is particularly elaborate within the family Trigoniidae.
Bieler, Carter, &amp; Coan (2010) included the following families in Trigonioidea. Taxa marked with a † are extinct.

Black-chested buzzard-eagle

The black-chested buzzard-eagle (Geranoaetus melanoleucus) is a bird of prey of the hawk and eagle family (Accipitridae). It lives in open regions of South America. This species is also known as the black buzzard-eagle, the gray buzzard-eagle, or analogously with "eagle" or "eagle-buzzard" replacing "buzzard-eagle", or as the Chilean blue eagle. It is sometimes placed in the genus "Buteo".
Description.
This is a huge eagle-like "buzzard" ("hawk" in American terminology). It has a total length of and a wingspan of . In the nominate race, males averaged and females averaged , with a range between both of . In the linearly slightly smaller "G. m. australis" subspecies, a male weighed and a female weighed , indicating the bulk of the two races is roughly the same.
It is noted for its bulky, powerful-looking build. It is rather long- and broad-winged and the slightly tapering tail is short by comparison and colored black, with grey tips in fresh plumage. When perched, the wings cover the tail almost completely, giving the bird a unique near-tailess appearance. The adult has a white underside, sometimes with fine blackish stripes; its upperparts are dark grey with a blackish, brownish, or bluish hue. The feathers of the neck and the lowest dark feathers of the breast are somewhat elongated. Adults have an ash-grey-and-white zone on the wings, the silvery white seen clearly from afar. The female is distinguished by a reddish-cinnamon hue to the upper- and underwing secondaries and is considerably larger than the male.
Among standard measurements, males possess a wing chord of , a tail of , a culmen of and a tarsus of . In comparison, females have a wing chord of , a tail of , a culmen of and a tarsus of .
The immature plumage is reminiscent of that of the great black hawk ("Buteogallus urubitinga"). Its upperparts are deep brown, sometimes almost black, and it has no light wing patch. The underside is white or light buff with heavy dark streaks on the breast and dark bars on the belly and thighs. It does not acquire the full adult plumage until 4–5 years old.
It is not very vocal, calling usually in flight and when close to the nest. Some calls resemble a wild human laugh, others are a curlew-like whistle. Occasionally flying birds give a high-pitched vocalization "kukukukuku".
The black-chested buzzard-eagle is readily identified in flight by its short wedge-shaped tail scarcely protruding from its long, broad wings. It is usually easy to make out the generally white underparts with the dark chest-band and tail if the birds are adult.
Taxonomy and systematics.
Its scientific name is Latinized Ancient Greek and means "black-and-white crane-eagle" or (if called "Buteo melanoleucos") "black-and-white buzzard": "Geranoaetus" comes from Ancient Greek "géranos" (γέρανoς), "crane" + "aetós" (ἆετός), "eagle". The "crane" reference is due to its grey upper wings and its loud cries. The alternative genus name "Buteo" is simply the Latin term used for these hawks in Ancient Rome, translating as "buzzard" (in the European sense). "melanoleucus" is from Ancient Greek "mélan-" (μέλαν-), "black-" + "leukós" (λευκός), "white". This refers to the contrasting coloration when seen from below.
When the black-chested buzzard-eagle was first described by Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1819, it was placed in the genus "Spizaetus", as "Spizaetus melanoleucus". Nowadays, however, the monotypic genus "Spizastur" is merged in "Spizaetus", and the black-and-white hawk-eagle, originally described as by Vieillot three years earlier as "Buteo melanoleucus", is now known as "Spizaetus melanoleucus". The earlier use of the specific epithet "melanoleucus" for the black-and-white hawk-eagle technically precludes its use for the black-chested buzzard-eagle, except when it is placed in "Geranoaetus". In fact, in the mid-20th century "Buteo fuscescens" was the prevailing name for the black-chested buzzard-eagle for some years, but it was eventually dismissed as erroneous. This specific name was established – as "Spizaetus fuscescens" – by Vieillot for the immature of the black-chested buzzard-eagle at the very same time as he described the adult because he could not believe that such differently-colored birds were conspecific.
As the two birds are not placed in the same genus today, Article 59.3 of the ICZN Code applies. According to this, a junior homonym replaced before 1961 is "not" rendered permanently invalid (as junior homonyms usually are) if "the substitute name is not in use" – which has been the case after Amadon's 1963 revision. Hence, in this case, the scientific name Buteo melanoleucus can apply, even though the black-and-white hawk-eagle was earlier described under exactly that name, while the senior homonym "melanoleucus" still applies to the latter species when placed in "Spizaetus" according to the usual ICZN rules. Consequently, the proper name to use for each bird has through a number of coincidences become the one the other species was described under.
Subspecies.
There are two subspecies:
Systematics.
The black-chested buzzard-eagle is allied to the "Buteo" hawks, and it is sometimes included with these. Other authors place it in the monotypic genus Geranoaetus. Though the former seems to be more appropriate from a phylogenetic standpoint, the latter is still used here, as much more research into phylogeny and hybridization has to take place before the correct taxonomy of the buteonines can be resolved. It stands to note that the taxonomic and systematic dispute goes back to the early-mid 20th century already. However, it seems there is no real reason to suppose that the lineage of the black-chested buzzard-eagle is North American in origin; fossils that might have been its ancestors, at first sight, differ in details and are more likely to belong to other buteonine lineages. Because of its buteonine lineage, this species and the closely related "Harpyhaliaetus" are not considered "true eagles", as are "Aquila" eagles and "hawk-eagles", and are thus the largest extant type of the diverse buteonine lineage.
This species could be close to the white-tailed hawk ("Buteo albicaudatus"), and perhaps to the grey-backed ("Leucopternis occidentalis"), white ("L. albicollis"), and mantled hawks ("L. polionotus") which it resembles in habitus except for being larger. Its closest living relatives may well be the red-backed ("B. polyosoma") and Puna hawks ("B. poecilochrous"). Particularly some populations of the former look like small black-chested buzzard eagles. The barred hawk ("L. princeps") looks similar to the black-chested buzzard-eagle in general color pattern, though the tail differs much in shape, size, and the bright white central band stands out.
The relationship of the black-chested buzzard-eagle to the prehistoric genera "Titanohierax" from the Caribbean and the Pan-American "Amplibuteo" also warrants more study. The crab-hawks ("Buteogallus") and the solitary "eagles" ("Harpyhaliaetus") seem to be allied with the latter, to the extent that these three genera might be united in "Buteogallus". That genus in the present restricted sense contains species also quite similar in habitus and size to the black-chested eagle-buzzard.
Fossil record.
Some fossils have been placed in "Geranoaetus", but those from North America have since been moved elsewhere:
Bones indistinguishable from those of living black-chested buzzard-eagles were found in a spring deposit at the Baños de Ciego Montero in Cienfuegos Province, Cuba. A partial left carpometacarpus – Specimen AMNH FR 6190 – as well as a fingerbone probably date from some time in the Pleistocene, during the last ice age. Its contemporary close relatives in Cuba, as far as it is known, consisted of the gigantic eagle-like buteonine hawks which were clearly distinct by size alone, while the Pleistocene record of similar-sized birds from continental North America is from the far west.
Habitat.
The black-chested buzzard-eagle is found in mountainous or hilly terrain with sparse vegetation, shrubland, or (in the south of its range) "Nothofagus" forest, where it spends a lot of time soaring in thermals and vertical drafts while looking for prey. It requires large territories with suitable habitat, the páramos at the north of its range, for example, while providing the latter, fails to provide the former, and thus it has only been recorded in the largest patches of such habitat, such as Páramo de Frontino. Most common between about and ASL, it rarely ventures into the lowlands.
Behaviour.
It is most conspicuous in the mid-morning and afternoon when individuals will seek out places that provide the best soaring conditions, such as north and west-facing slopes and ridges. Apparently, their main interest at these times is aerial play and display; they tend to ignore places where food is more plentiful or easily hunted in favor of simply soaring alone or in pairs in strong air currents.
The food of this carnivore consists mainly of mid-sized mammals; the introduced European rabbit seems to have become a key prey item. The black-chested buzzard-eagle is helpful to farmers by keeping down the numbers of rabbits, which can be serious agricultural pests. Native common degus also take a large part of its diet. Other mammals are also taken such as viscachas and caviid rodents. Occasionally, it will take carnivores such as Humboldt's hog-nosed skunks, lesser grisons and even larger Andes skunks and gray foxes. Its diet is rounded off with an occasional bird. Avian prey species are usually small passerines or rails but carnivorous species like the burrowing owl and sizeable prey such as "Penelope" guans, buff-necked ibis or the Chilean tinamou are also taken. large squamates, and if need be also arthropods and carrion will be added in their diet. It is near the top of the avian food chain in its range, in part since it is the only Andean eagle found outside forest habitats. It may compete for carrion with the much larger Andean condor.
Reproduction.
It nests in high trees or on rocky cliffs, or if these are not available on high trees or even cacti. If no appropriate high place is available this species will nest in bushes or even on the ground. In Ecuador, nesting can be observed all year round; elsewhere it might have a more restricted breeding season but the information is scant and somewhat contradictory. The nest is a huge mass of sticks about in diameter; the black-chested buzzard-eagle is just as likely to reuse an existing nest as to build a new one, and several abandoned nests are often found in the vicinity of an active one. The male and female engage in courtship flights and copulate over a prolonged time of several weeks as the pairs bond. Little is known of the actual nesting; the clutch contains usually 2 but sometimes 1 or 3 eggs, which are incubated for about a month. The nestlings presumably are covered in white down like in its relatives. While not aggressive under normal circumstances, the black-chested eagle-buzzard will fiercely attack humans if it considers itself or its offspring threatened.
Conservation.
Owing the wide overall range "Geranoaetus melanoleucus" is considered a species of Least Concern by the IUCN. 
While it is rare and declining in places – e.g. in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina states in Brazil, or in parts of Argentina – its habitat requirements mean that it will to some degree benefit from deforestation and it has for example colonized regions of the former Mata Atlântica forest in Alagoas. The declines in Argentina have been attributed to poisoning by strychnine baits deployed by sheep farmers trying to eradicate pests.

The Mackenzies

The Mackenzies were a Scottish indie band from Glasgow, Scotland, active around 1986/87, who released two singles of jagged indie-funk on Ron Johnson Records. They contributed the track "Big Jim (There's No Pubs in Heaven)" to the "NME" 's C86 compilation. They also recorded two sessions for BBC Radio 1's John Peel, the first of which was repeated seven times, such was Peel's high regard for it. When the band split up, the drummer Paul Turnbull resurfaced in The Secret Goldfish.

Arctic Adventure (video game)

Arctic Adventure is a platform game written for DOS, published by Apogee Software. It is the sequel to "Pharaoh's Tomb". The protagonist, Nevada Smith, is an archaeologist searching for a Viking treasure in the Arctic. It was re-released on Steam in 2015 with support for Windows and macOS.
Gameplay.
The gameplay has many similarities to its predecessor, "Pharaoh's Tomb", both games being based on the same FAST engine. The main difference is that the game starts in an overworld map and the player has to enter each of the 20 levels to play them. The last level is blocked and all the other levels have to be completed to access it. Some of the levels are across the icy lakes, requiring the player to obtain a boat from one of the levels to proceed. Some levels are blocked by gates which can be unlocked with keys collected from other levels.
During the levels Nevada Smith has infinite lives. He is armed with a pistol with limited ammo, but can be charged up with various pickups. Sometimes passages are blocked by ice blocks which can broken by using up collectable pickaxes. If the player exits a level via a drainpipe, four random bonus levels can be played for additional points. In the last level, the player wins the game and ends the episode by collecting a map piece quarter.
Release.
The working title for the game was "Journey to the Center of the Earth", but it was later renamed "Arctic Adventure". "Arctic Adventure" was distributed as shareware. It consists of four episodes (named Volume 1 to 4), with only the first episode distributed as shareware, and the rest available commercially. Each level consists of a single room, and there are 20 levels in each episode. The game includes a map screen that gives some flexibility into the order in which the levels can be played.
The game was discontinued in 2000 and released as freeware on March 20, 2009. In October 2014, 3D Realms released "3D Realms Anthology", which included "Arctic Adventure" in the collection. The end of the game implies that Nevada Smith will continue his adventures, seeking the lost diamond mines of Africa, but a sequel was never made.

Nahash of Ammon

Nahash was the name of a king of Ammon, mentioned in the Books of Samuel and Chronicles in the Hebrew Bible.
Nahash appears abruptly as the attacker of Jabesh-Gilead, which lay outside the territory he laid claim to. Having subjected the occupants to a siege, the population sought terms for surrender, and were told by Nahash that they had a choice of death (by the sword) or having their right eyes gouged out. The population obtained seven days' grace from Nahash, during which they would be allowed to seek help from the Israelites, after which they would have to submit to the terms of surrender. The occupants sought help from the people of Israel, sending messengers throughout the whole territory, and Saul, a herdsman at this time, responded by raising an army which decisively defeated Nahash and his cohorts at Bezek.
The strangely cruel terms given by Nahash for surrender were explained by Josephus as being the usual practice of Nahash. A more complete explanation came to light with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls: although not present in either the Septuagint or Masoretic Text, an introductory passage, preceding this narrative, was found in a copy of the Books of Samuel among the scrolls found in cave 4:
In other words, Nahash had conquered the tribal lands of Gad and Reuben, and a portion of the population had fled from him to Jabesh-Gilead, which is why he laid siege to it.
Nothing more is told about Nahash in the Books of Samuel until his death, at the start of the reign of David, is mentioned. At this point, the narrative states that David sent a message of condolence to Hanun, the heir of Nahash, because Nahash had shown kindness to David. There is a tradition that when David had earlier entrusted his family to the King of Moab (cf. 1 Samuel 22:3–4) the latter slew the entire family, except for one of David's brothers who had escaped and found asylum with Nahash. Jerome suggested that David's sympathy was because both he and Nahash were enemies of Saul. However, Josephus claimed that Nahash was slain when the Ammonites were defeated by Saul, which would, if true, make the Nahash whose death David lamented a different person; it is unclear on what basis Josephus (who lived some 900 years later) makes his claim.
There is also a man named "Nahash" who is described by 2 Samuel 17:27–29 as the father of Shobi, a man who aided David against Absalom. The "Jewish Encyclopedia" argues that the father of Abigail, the king of the Ammonites, and the father of Shobi, were the same individual, hence making Shobi, Hanun, and David, half-brothers. In consequence of this view, it would seem that Shobi shared his father's positive view of David, while Hanun, Shobi's brother and David's half-brother saw David as an enemy. However some rabbis argued that Shobi was in fact Hanun; in this argument Hanun must have fallen out with David when they both took control of their respective thrones. Wellhausen on the other hand believed that 2 Samuel 17:25 originally named Jesse as the father of Abigail, and the current mention there of "Nahash" (נחש) is a typographic error caused by the brevity of the letters for "Jesse" (ישי) and the presence in verse 27 of the name "Nahash".
Etymology
In the Hebrew Bible, נחש (nakhash), first appears in Genesis 3:1 - often translated as serpent. In certain instances, נחש may be translated as serpent or snake in noun form, as divination in verb form, or shiny metal (like copper or bronze) in noun form.
Nature, character, and associations develop throughout the progression of the Hebrew Bible with נחש. Beginning in the Garden of Eden as a deceiving serpent, the concept of divination and a brazen, shining figure are also possible in the translation exercise. If viewing Genesis 1:14-19 as it relates to ancient cosmology, the Genesis 3:1 serpent may be seen as a shining heavenly being too. A more complete picture may be drawn of a serpent figure, brazen and shining in appearance, deceiving Eve with his access of heavenly knowledge.
Nahash, king of Ammon, would by ancient standards have access to the knowledge of the gods - a diviner - and he also would have associations with a brazen, shining appearance when dressed as king. In his introduction in the story of 1 Samuel 11, an ancient reader may have thematically viewed Nahash through the lens of the deceptive serpent that preceded him.
In the context of 1 Samuel 11, Saul appears as one who defeats the serpent, Nahash. The statement in Genesis 3:15, regarding the crushing of the serpent's head by the seed of the woman, finds partial fulfillment in the actions of the first king of Israel. [ref. Dr. Michael S. Heiser].

Too Much Too Young (EP)

Too Much Too Young - The Special A.K.A. Live! is a live EP by the Specials with Rico Rodriguez, released on 11 January 1980. On the original release, the front cover credited the performers as "The Special A.K.A. featuring Rico", while the back cover mentions and the labels credited only The Specials.
Renowned for their live shows, the Specials released a five-track live EP in January 1980 as the third single by the band. The EP featured "Too Much Too Young" (originally recorded on the album "The Specials") with "Guns of Navarone" recorded live in London; and "Skinhead Symphony" - a medley of "Long Shot Kick De Bucket", "The Liquidator" and "Skinhead Moonstomp" - which was recorded at Tiffany's in Coventry.
Lead track "Too Much Too Young" was based on the 1969 song "Birth Control" by Lloyd Charmers.
Contrary to what is sometimes stated, "Too Much Too Young" was not banned by the BBC due to mentions of contraception in the lyrics. However, when the song's promotional video was featured on "Top of the Pops", it was cut off just before the final line, "try wearing a cap".
The song topped the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in February 1980. It became only the second EP to top the chart after "The Roussos Phenomenon EP" in 1976, and was also the first live recording to top the chart since Billy Connolly's "D.I.V.O.R.C.E." in 1975. At 2:04, it was the shortest song to reach No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart in the 1980s.
Rodriguez played trombone on "Guns of Navarone" and "Long Shot Kick De Bucket", and Dick Cuthell played flugelhorn on "Guns of Navarone".

Khyal Muhammad

Ustad Khyal Muhammad (, born 1946) is a Pashtun singer from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. He has appeared regularly on television, usually singing ghazals and in movies.
Career.
Khyal Mohammad belongs to the Afridi tribe of Pushtuns. He is originally from Tirah in Khyber Tribal District. He was born in Peshawar on 5 January 1946 to a musical family. His brother Saif Ul-Maluk was a popular singer in the 1960s, who often performed on Radio Peshawar. Saif introduced him to the radio station, where he first performed in 1958, aged 13. However, for the next ten years he mainly restricted himself to playing instruments such as the tabla and harmonium. In the late 1960s he began singing and recording ghazals, traditional Pashto poems, a daring gamble since the music scene at that time was dominated by folk music. His style soon became popular in Peshawar and the NWFP.
After establishing his name on the local radio, in 1973–74 Khyal Mohammad appeared in his first movie, "Dara-i-Khyber", one of the first "Pollywood" Pashto movies. This gave his career a kick-start, and since then he has appeared in many other movies. As his popularity continued to grow, he often toured in Afghanistan, Europe, the UAR and the USA. Over the years he has recorded a volume of music, and has also appeared as a playback singer in many movies, winning many awards. He has been called the Elvis Presley of Pashto music.
Musical style.
Khyal Muhammad renders ghazal songs in a traditional manner, choosing pieces that combine mysticism, romance and philosophy, usually with an undertone of melancholy. His voice has impressive range, but is always fully under control. Radio, television and movie producers have paid tribute to his professionalism and ability to produce flawless performances with minimal rehearsal. Zahoor Khan Zaiby, a Pakhtoon composer of Balochi and Sindhi tunes, says "Lala is an expert at harnessing the mood of the moment and the poetry through his voice. The songs from his films are considered Pashto anthems." One of his album is named as "Sawee Daghuna"
Awards.
In 1991, Khyal was given the "National Film Award" for playback singer. Khyal Muhammad has received a Pride of Performance presidential award, two National Awards and a gold medal from Pakistan Television Corporation presented by Madame Noor Jehan. In April 2009, Chief Minister Ameer Haider Khan Hoti presented a cheque for Rs one million to Khyal Muhammad on behalf of the provincial government for his services to Pushto music and ghazals. On 1 November 2016, he was awarded with the Mir Bacha Khan medal by Afghan government in a gathering at Nishtar Hall Peshawar. In 2022 Radio Pakistan, Peshawar conferred Khyal Muhammad with the 'Mehdi Hassan diamond jubilee independence award'.

Jason Day

Jason Anthony Day (born 12 November 1987) is an Australian professional golfer. Day had early success as a professional, earning PGA Tour membership in his teens and winning an event in his third season, the HP Byron Nelson Championship. In 2015, Day recorded his breakout season, winning five events including the PGA Championship, a major championship, while ascending to #1 in the world. Day maintained exemplary play through 2016, winning three tournaments including The Players Championship and preserving his #1 ranking. Since that season, however, Day's play has been much more erratic and he ultimately fell outside of the top 100 in the world. In 2023, however, he recorded a comeback year, winning the AT&amp;T Byron Nelson, the site of his first win, and returning to the world's top 20.
Early life.
Day was born in Beaudesert, Queensland. His father, Alvin, was Irish Australian, and his mother, Dening, migrated from the Philippines to Australia in the early 1980s. He has two siblings, Yanna and Kim. His father took him to Beaudesert Golf Club and enrolled him as a junior member just after his sixth birthday. He was allowed to play six holes a day as a junior. At the age of eight his family moved to Rockhampton, and during this period he began to win events in the surrounding districts. Alvin Day died of stomach cancer when Jason was 12.
Day's mother sent him to Kooralbyn International School, which had a golf course attached. Later he went to Hills International College, where they have a golf academy, at the behest of his coach, Col Swatton, who had moved there when Kooralbyn school closed down. Day borrowed a book about Tiger Woods from his roommate, and it inspired him to improve his golf by practicing in the early morning, at lunch-time and in the evening. He used the book's reports of Woods' scores as his benchmark for improvement and as a reachable standard. His first big win was at the age of 13 in a 2000 Australian Masters junior event on the Gold Coast, where he won with scores of 87, 78, 76 and 76.
Amateur career.
As an amateur, Day was twice awarded the Australian Junior Order of Merit. He finished seventh and was the leading amateur at the Queensland Open. Day won the Australian Boys' Amateur in 2004. His amateur success extended to the United States, where he won the Boys 15–17 division at the 2004 Callaway World Junior Championship and was runner-up in the 2005 Porter Cup. He was a member of the Golf Australia National Squad.
In 2005, Day lost in a playoff at the Greater Building Society QLD PGA Championship; a professional event on the Von Nida Tour. He was beaten by Scott Gardiner on the fourth extra hole.
Professional career.
2006–10: Early career.
Day turned professional in July 2006 after winning the Green Jacket at the NEC Master of the Amateurs, signing with TaylorMade and Adidas and immediately began playing PGA Tour events, principally through sponsors' exemptions. He made the cut in five of his first six PGA Tour events as a pro with a best finish of eleventh at the Reno-Tahoe Open and with official winnings of over $160,000. He entered PGA Tour qualifying, or Q-School. Placed in the second of three rounds, he tied for first in his section of the second round, advancing to the Q-School finals. However, in the six-round finals he played poorly, shooting fifteen shots higher than the score needed to qualify. Accordingly, he failed to earn his 2007 PGA Tour card but earned conditional status on the Nationwide Tour for 2007.
Day won his first Nationwide Tour event in July 2007 at the Legend Financial Group Classic, becoming the youngest man to win on any of the PGA Tour's three tours. The win jumped him to eighth on the Nationwide Tour's money list. He ended up finishing 5th on the money list to earn his PGA Tour card for 2008. He had a mediocre season, but had conditional status for 2009. A second-place finish at the Puerto Rico Open helped Day retain his card for 2010, and he finished 69th in the money list.
In May 2010, he became the youngest Australian to win a PGA Tour event, winning the HP Byron Nelson Championship. Day gained entry into his first ever major championship at the 2010 Open Championship after Greg Norman withdrew. Day went on to make the cut and finish in a tie for 60th place. In August 2010, Day made his first appearance at the PGA Championship, where a 66 on Saturday helped him to finish seven-under-par for the tournament and earn his first top-10 in a major. This run of form continued during the FedEx Cup playoff season, where Day enjoyed top-five finishes at the first two playoff events to qualify for the season-ending Tour Championship. He would go on to finish T17 at East Lake Golf Club and ended the 2010 season ranked 21st on the PGA Tour money list.
2011–14: Contending in majors.
At the 2011 Masters Tournament, Day birdied the last two holes, but came up two strokes short of eventual winner Charl Schwartzel. Day tied for second with Adam Scott and at −12 set the Masters record for the lowest score by a first-time participant. This was his best performance in a major championship, and throughout the final round Day was tied for the lead on a number of occasions before eventually finishing in a tie for second after Schwartzel made four consecutive birdies to win the tournament.
In June 2011, Day participated at Congressional for the 2011 U.S. Open, his maiden appearance in a U.S. Open. Following his successful run at the Masters, Day achieved consecutive second-place finishes in the majors, this time finishing alone in second, some eight strokes behind runaway leader Rory McIlroy. He shot the equal lowest round of the week on Saturday, a 65, to jump up the leaderboard into a tie for third after round three. On Sunday, although he did not challenge for the lead, he was the best of the rest of the field as the Open was dominated by wire-to-wire winner McIlroy.
As a result of his major performances, Day moved into the Official World Golf Ranking top-10 for the first time in his career at ninth. Despite not winning a tournament during 2011, Day ended the season ranked 9th on the PGA Tour money list. He contended in a major once again at the 2013 Masters Tournament when he shot rounds of 70 and 68 to take a one-shot lead over Fred Couples going to the weekend. In the third round, Day was tied for the lead through 16 holes but bogeyed the last two holes to shoot a 73 and finish two shots behind Brandt Snedeker and Ángel Cabrera. During the final round, Day got off to a quick start by going birdie-eagle to take a one-shot lead. Day would later go on to birdie 13, 14, and 15 to take a one-shot lead with three holes to play. However, he bogeyed 16 and 17 and just missed a birdie putt at 18 that would have tied the lead. He shot a 70 and finished two shots back in third place behind Adam Scott, and Cabrera.
Day finished as a runner-up for the third time in a major championship at the 2013 U.S. Open at Merion Golf Club. He finished in a tie for second alongside Phil Mickelson, two strokes behind Justin Rose. Day tied the lead with a birdie at the 10th, but bogeys at 11, 14, and 18 would prevent him from winning his first major championship. It was the second time in his career Day had finished as a runner-up at the U.S. Open, and Day is also the only player in 2013 to hold a lead on the back nine Sunday at both majors. He tied for the lowest cumulative score in all four majors in 2013, with fellow Australian Adam Scott at +2.
In February 2014, Day won his first World Golf Championship event, the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, after a final in which Victor Dubuisson won the last two holes to tie, then twice scrambled halves after missing greens at the extra holes before Day finally secured victory. The win lifted Day to fourth in the world rankings.
2015: Major champion and World #1.
In February 2015, Day won his third PGA Tour event and his seventh title as a pro, winning the Farmers Insurance Open with a score of 279 (−9) after prevailing in a four-way playoff over Harris English, J. B. Holmes and Scott Stallings. He won at the second hole with a par while Holmes made bogey, after English and Stallings were eliminated at the first hole. The victory lifted Day back to fourth in the Official World Golf Ranking.
During the second round of the 2015 U.S. Open, Day collapsed on his 18th hole, the 9th hole on the course, having started the day on the 10th. He was very slow to get back up and was shaking and wobbly. It was later revealed that this was due to vertigo, a diagnosis Day had received from his doctor a month prior. However, the very next day, when he wasn't even sure if he would play, Day ended the third round tied for the lead. He finished the tournament tied for 9th. At the 2015 Open Championship at St Andrews, Day entered the final round as one of the 54-hole co-leaders and shot a bogey-free 70 to finish at 14-under-par and one stroke outside of the 3-way playoff. He had a putt for birdie on the 72nd hole to join the playoff but left it inches short. Day's tie for fourth, however, was his best finish at the Open Championship and was the sixth time he had finished in the top 5 of a major without winning one.
The following week at the RBC Canadian Open in Oakville, Canada, Day outlasted Bubba Watson and hometown favourite David Hearn to win the tournament, his second tour victory of the season and fourth overall. He made birdies on the last three holes in the final round to take a one-stroke victory. The 2015 PGA Championship was the final major championship of the 2015 season, hosted at the historic Whistling Straits. Jason Day produced an exceptional performance shooting rounds of 68, 67, 66 and 67 to best his nearest competitor, Jordan Spieth, by three strokes. This also preventing Spieth from winning a third major championship that season, although Spieth did dethrone Rory McIlroy to become the No. 1 ranked PGA player. Jason Day also set a new record that week becoming the first player in history to finish at 20-under-par in a major.
Day's hot streak continued with wins in The Barclays and the BMW Championship, two of the first three events in the FedEx Cup playoffs. As a result of the BMW Championship win, on 20 September 2015, Day gained the world number 1 ranking for the first time. Day entered the Tour Championship as the FedEx Cup leader, but he finished tied for tenth. Jordan Spieth would win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup as well as retaking the number one world ranking.
2016.
After a missed cut in the defence of his Farmers Insurance Open title, Day claimed his first win of the year and eighth overall on the PGA Tour at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he beat Kevin Chappell by one shot. Day's victory was wire-to-wire having shot all four rounds under par (66-65-70-70) to finish with a −17 total. He birdied the 17th hole during the final round and had to get up and down from the bunker on the 72nd hole to hold on for the win. Day rose one place in the world rankings to number two, overtaking Rory McIlroy.
Just a week later, Day was in the winner's circle again at the WGC-Dell Match Play. He overtook Jordan Spieth to reach world No. 1 with his progression through to the semi-finals before beating Louis Oosthuizen 5 &amp; 4 in the final in Austin, Texas for his ninth PGA Tour win.
He followed these victories up with a 4-stroke, wire-to-wire win at the 2016 Players Championship for his 10th career PGA Tour victory. Afterwards, he was hailed by world No.2 and nearest rival Jordan Spieth, while Adam Scott called his run of form 'Tiger-esque'.
In late June, Day announced that he would not be playing in the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, citing concerns over the Zika virus.
As of July 2016, Day has earned over $33 million in prize money on the PGA Tour.
2017.
On 1 January 2017, Nike announced that Day was joining Nike Golf ahead of the SBS Tournament of Champions at Kapalua the following week. It was announced that he will wear Nike clothes, shoes and gloves, following the brand's decision to stop making clubs and balls. Nike Golf unveiled a commercial to announce the multi-year sponsorship deal worth a reported $10m a year. Day was known to have the RBC logo on the collar of his shirts, but because Nike does not allow other sponsorships to be seen on their apparel, his sponsorship contract with RBC was not renewed. He continues to wear the Lexus logo on the left sleeve of his shirts, as he previously did before using Nike apparel.
On 13 September 2017, after a winless season, Day split from his caddie of 11 years – his entire professional career – and 'father figure' Colin Swatton. Day confirmed, though, that Swatton would remain as his swing coach.
2018.
In January, Day won the Farmers Insurance Open, at Torrey Pines for a second time, for his 11th PGA Tour win and first in over eighteen months. He defeated Alex Norén and Ryan Palmer in a sudden-death playoff, that lasted six extra holes. Palmer had been eliminated by birdies on the first extra hole, but a further five holes were needed to separate Day and Norén. Play had to be suspended after the fifth extra hole, with the players coming back for a Monday finish. Day finally claimed the victory with a birdie on the sixth extra hole, after Norén had found water with his second shot to the green. The win lifted Day back into the world's top 10. In May, Day won the Wells Fargo Championship.
2019.
Day continued to battle chronic back pain in 2019. After a decade of dealing with the problem, he was not afraid to try new remedies. "I was explaining the other day that I was blowing into balloons," Day told reporters at Quail Hollow in May 2019. "Which is crazy, because I haven't really trained at all this year because I've been so sore." The balloon therapy, which takes about 20–30 minutes twice a day, is supposed to help get his rib cage, hips and shoulders aligned, thereby alleviating pressure on his back. "Blowing into balloons, that's as far as I go," he said of the therapy. "Long story short, I try to keep my rib cage down. My rib cage gets up and then it blocks my mid back and then I can't really turn. So I get it from somewhere else and that's why my back flares up."
Following the 2019 U.S. Open, Day was being caddied by Tiger Woods' former caddie, Steve Williams. In June 2019, golf media reported that Williams was "the boss" of the player-caddie relationship and was telling Day what to do. "Pretty much when he asks you to do something you pretty much do it," Day said of Williams. Case in point: following an uninspiring round of even par on a rainy Thursday afternoon at the Travelers Championship, Day headed straight to the range at Williams' request. A day later, Day shot 63. "We've definitely been a lot more disciplined about going to the range and putting green, chipping green after the round and making sure we're staying on top of it, especially with our feels," said Day. "I've got a lot of work [to do] . . . [Steve] is very black and white." After Day missed the cut at The Northern Trust in August 2019, Day and Williams parted ways citing a 'disconnect between old school and new school'.
On 21 October 2019, Day won over Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Hideki Matsuyama.
Day was originally a captain's pick for the International team of the Presidents Cup but withdrew with a back injury. He was replaced by An Byeong-hun.
2023.
In May 2023, Day won the AT&amp;T Byron Nelson by one shot, this was his first victory in five years. He also finished runner-up at the 2023 Open Championship, completing the "runner-up grand slam", as he finished runner-up at every major.
In December, Day won the inaugural Grant Thornton Invitational mixed team tournament with playing partner Lydia Ko.
Personal life.
Day married Ellie Harvey (of Lucas, Ohio), in 2009. The couple live in Westerville, Ohio, with their five children. On 17 December 2015, while watching a Cleveland Cavaliers game against the Oklahoma City Thunder at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ellie sustained injuries after Cavaliers player LeBron James collided with her while attempting to retrieve a loose ball. She exited the arena on a stretcher with her head immobilized and was admitted to a nearby hospital.
Day had previously lived in Orlando, Florida, and Fort Worth, Texas.
In November 2013, eight of Day's relatives in the Philippines, including his grandmother, died during Typhoon Haiyan.

Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg

Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg (née Schiller; 3 January 1903 – 8 April 1945) was a German aviator who served as a test pilot in the Luftwaffe before and during World War II.
She was the second German woman to be awarded the honorary title of "Flugkapitän" () and also flew over 2,500 test flights in dive bombers, the second most of any Luftwaffe test pilot. Von Stauffenberg was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class and the Gold Front Flying Clasp for Bombers with diamonds, for performing over 1,500 test flights in dive bomber aircraft. 
In 1944 she was arrested with other Stauffenberg family members on suspicion of conspiring with her brothers-in-law to assassinate Adolf Hitler, but she was later released to continue her test-flight duties.
Countess von Stauffenberg died after being shot down by an American reconnaissance plane on 8 April 1945.
Early life and education.
Melitta was born in Krotoschin, Prussia. Her father was Michael Schiller, a Jewish man who converted to Christianity at the age of 18. Her mother was Margaret Eberstein. She had four siblings: Marie-Luise, Otto, Jutta and Klara.
With the end of World War I Krotoschin became part of Poland. In October 1919 Melitta began attending boarding school across the border in Hirschberg, Silesia.
Melitta passed the diploma for university entrance in 1922 and accepted a place at the Technical University of Munich. There she studied mathematics, physics and engineering, eventually specialising in aeronautical engineering. In 1927 she graduated "cum laude".
Aviation experience.
Melitta started working for the "Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt" (DVL), an experimental institute for aviation, in Berlin-Adlershof in 1927. In July 1929 she began flying lessons at Staaken and obtained her provisional flying license within a few months and her full license by mid-1930.
In 1936 she was forced from her job as "Ingenieurflugzeugführerin" (aeronautical engineer) because of her paternal grandfather's Jewish origins, despite her father having converted to Christianity at the age of 18.
On 11 August 1937 at Berlin-Wilmersdorf, Melitta married the historian Alexander Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, and on 28 October 1937, she was given the honorary rank of "Flugkapitänin", or "flight captain", a rank reserved for test pilots in Germany at the time, and became only the second woman in Germany, after Hanna Reitsch, to achieve this. She eventually gained licences for all classes of powered aircraft, the aerobatic flying licence, and the glider licence.
World War II.
At the beginning of World War II, Melitta wanted to work for the Red Cross but was ordered to become a test pilot for the "Luftwaffe" at the central "Erprobungsstelle" test facility in Rechlin, Mecklenburg. Still a civilian, she was officially seconded from in Berlin. She did test dives in warplanes, up to 15 times a day, from a height of 4,000 metres.
From 1942, Melitta continued her test-flights at the Luftwaffe's technical academy in Berlin-Gatow. She was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 22 January 1943; the medal was pinned on her by the chief of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe himself, Hermann Göring on the 29th. She made her dissertation for her Masters qualification in 1944, and received an A grade. She then became technical chief of the "Versuchsstelle für Flugsondergeräte", another test institute, in the same year.
When the 20 July plot failed, she was arrested with the rest of the Stauffenberg family. Her two brothers-in-law, Claus and Berthold, were executed. She and her husband, as well as the other adult members of the family, were sent to concentration camps. However, she was released on 2 September because of the military importance of her work. As the name von Stauffenberg was anything but popular among the Nazis, she was now officially addressed as "Gräfin Schenk" instead of "Gräfin Schenk von Stauffenberg". Her sisters-in-law, one of them pregnant, were confined in concentration camps and the Stauffenberg children were taken away from their mothers. Melitta used her prominent position to help as much as she could.
Melitta felt loyal to Germany, but not to the Nazis. She therefore supported the Luftwaffe, but she confessed in her diaries that this moral conflict tormented her. 
Melitta maintained contact with the incarcerated members of her extended family, even though they were imprisoned in concentration camps. Her status, and the possibility that the prisoners might be useful in a bargain with the Western Allies when Germany finally fell, kept them moderately well looked after. She flew several times to Buchenwald concentration camp once she learned in March 1945 that her husband was there. As research facilities in Berlin were dispersed to other locations ahead of the Soviet advance, Melitta's activities were moved to Wurzberg, where she found that a RAF raid had destroyed her house.
Death.
On 4 April, with her assistant pilot Hubertus, she set out for Buchenwald. Seeing from the air that the special prisoner compound was empty – the prisoners had been moved to Regensburg – she flew back to Weimar. They flew some personnel from Weimar in an overloaded Siebel Si 204 to Pilsen, where they exchanged the Siebel for a two-seater Bü 181 Bestmann trainer on 6 April. At Marienburg, Hubertus left her to fly on to Straubing and then Regensburg to look for her husband. By that point, her husband and other prisoners had been moved again; Melitta got a Gestapo authorisation to visit the commandant at Schönberg, where they had been taken.
She took off early on 8 April 1945, flying low to the ground along the line of the railway to navigate. An American F-6D reconnaissance airplane flown by First Lieutenant Norbourn Thomas, who was hunting Ju 87s, attacked her near Straßkirchen, Bavaria. She crash-landed the aircraft and was conscious when civilians arrived to help. She asked for assistance to get out of the aircraft, and was extracted from the aircraft alive. The civilians reported her most serious injury appeared to be a broken leg. 
A local doctor, Hans Siegl from Straßkirchen, arrived at the scene, but as a Luftwaffe doctor and other military were on scene, his services were not needed; she was taken off in an ambulance. Von Stauffenberg's injuries did not appear life-threatening, but she died two hours later. Her remains were taken to the hospital in Straubing, where the town mortuary book noted as the cause of death "...skull base fracture, tearing of the left thigh, fracture of the right ankle." Her husband learned of her death a few days later. 
She was buried on 13 April in St Michaels Cemetery, arranged by Staubing airbase commander's assistant. In September 1945 Alexander arranged to have her exhumed and transported to the Stauffenberg estate at Lautlingen where she was interred in the family crypt on 8 September 1945.

List of neighbourhoods in Montreal

This is the list of the neighbourhoods in the city of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. They are sorted by the borough they are located in.
LaSalle.
No particular neighbourhoods.
Cecil-P.-Newman 
Sault-Saint-Louis
Le Plateau-Mont-Royal.
The Plateau.
Montreal's trendy and colourful Plateau Mont Royal neighbourhood is located on the twin North-South axes of Saint Laurent Boulevard and Saint Denis Street, and East-West axes of Mount Royal Avenue and Sherbrooke Street. The granite-paved, pedestrian-only Prince Arthur Street is also located in this neighbourhood. In the summer, nightlife often seems as active as in the day in this area.
The Plateau boasts the highest population density of all Montreal and the greatest number of creative people in Canada, according to Statistics Canada. The same source also states that it is the urban place where the most people travel mainly by foot, bicycle or public transport. In 1997, Utne Reader magazine included the Plateau Mont-Royal in its list of "15 Hippest places to live." The exterior staircase is a distinctive feature of the city's architecture.
Mile End.
The tiny "Mile End" district, officially part of the Plateau borough but generally considered distinct, is home to many Montreal artists and filmmakers. The city's two famous bagel emporia, Fairmount Bagel and St. Viateur Bagel, are located on their respective streets. Fairmount Avenue is also home to Wilensky's, immortalized in the Mordecai Richler novel "The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz".
Little Portugal.
Montreal has a modest Portuguese population, some of which is concentrated in Little Portugal, which is at the corner of Saint-Laurent Boulevard and Rachel street. Portuguese businesses can be found along several blocks of Saint-Laurent between Pine and Marie-Anne. The Portuguese area has largely absorbed what used to be the traditional Jewish neighbourhood.
Le Sud-Ouest.
Griffintown and Goose Village.
District directly southwest of downtown Montreal and west of the old harbour. In the 19th century Griffintown and adjacent Goose Village were home to thousands of Irish immigrants (mostly Catholics), many of whom worked for the railway and on massive local projects such as the Victoria Bridge, or in the Northern Electric building, now Le Nordelec, just across the bridge in Point St. Charles.
Griffintown became a multi-ethnic neighbourhood by the turn of the twentieth century, with French-Canadians, Anglo-Protestants and, later, Italians and others, but keeping a majority of Irish Catholics. The Irish community claims the neighbourhood as a "lieu du mémoire" because of its significance as one of the earliest sites of Irish immigration in North America.
Many of the immigrants who arrived on "fever ships" or "coffin ships" during the diaspora sparked by the Great Famine of Ireland suffered from typhoid or other diseases and were quarantined in hastily constructed wooden "fever sheds" at Grosse-Île outside Quebec City and in Griffintown and Goose Village. Roughly six thousand Irish immigrants died in fever sheds at nearby Windmill Point during the typhus epidemic of 1847. They are commemorated by a black rock near the Victoria Bridge.
The collapse of heavy industry following World War II and the later closure of the Lachine Canal created poor economic conditions, and for several decades Griffintown was a low-income neighbourhood featuring small industries and offices and sporadic remaining residential buildings. In recent years it has undergone a massive change, with major condo projects spring up, some obliterating the old street grid. The old urban geography is vanishing in Griffintown by the day.
Pointe-Saint-Charles.
An area located in the South-West borough, south of downtown between the Lachine Canal and the St. Lawrence River. Often referred to as 'The Point', it was originally a mainly English-speaking Irish working-class neighbourhood developed around factories and other Victorian-era industry. Changes in economic fortune in the mid-20th century led Point St. Charles into a decline that has only recently begun to change as a wave of gentrification has given the area new life. The neighbourhood has a documented reputation as one of the poorest in Montreal, and one of the roughest in Canada. Its inhabitants have been the subject of several National Film Board of Canada documentaries. Playwright David Fennario hails from the district.
Montréal-Nord.
Marie-Clarac 
Ovide-Clermont
Outremont.
Claude-Ryan 
Jeanne-Sauvé
Joseph-Beaubien 
Robert-Bourassa
Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie.
Little Italy.
Montreal has the second largest Italian population in Canada after Toronto. There are around 250,000 Montrealers of Italian ancestry living within its Metropolitan Area. Montreal's Little Italy, located on St. Lawrence Boulevard between Jean-Talon and St. Zotique, is home to Montreal's original Italian Canadian community. Although many Italians in Montreal have since moved to other parts of town, Montreal's Little Italy has not lost its heritage, as it is home to a large collection of Italian restaurants, bars, and shops.
Saint-Léonard.
Città Italiana.
There is also a very prominent Italian Canadian community in the Montreal borough of Saint Leonard, nicknamed Città Italiana. This borough is located further east on Jean-Talon Boulevard. "Città Italiana" can be considered Montreal's second Little Italy and is home to Montreal's Via Italia. Many Italian cultural centres, such as The Leonardo Da Vinci Centre, are located in Saint Leonard. Its services are offered in English, French and Italian. This cultural building contains theaters, gyms, bocce playing areas, and a cafe.
Ville-Marie.
Downtown Montreal.
Downtown Montreal lies at the foot of Mount Royal, most of which is a major urban park, and extends toward the St. Lawrence River. It is located entirely within the Ville Marie borough. The Downtown area contains dozens of notable skyscrapers—which bylaws restrict to the height of Mount Royal—including the aforementioned 1000 de La Gauchetière and 1250 René-Lévesque. The Tour de la Bourse (Stock Exchange Tower) is also another significant building in Montreal, and is home to the Montreal Exchange, which trades in derivatives such as futures contracts and options. The Montreal Exchange was the first stock exchange in Canada. In 1999 all stock trades were transferred to Toronto in exchange for exclusivity in derivatives trading.
Place Ville-Marie, an I. M. Pei-designed cruciform office tower built in 1962, sits atop an underground shopping mall that forms the nexus of Montreal's underground city, the world's largest at in length. The underground city gives its 500,000 daily visitors indoor access to 2,000 stores, 200 restaurants, 1,200 offices, 1,600 housing units, 10 metro stations, train stations, bus terminals, and tunnels extending all over downtown. The central axis for downtown is Saint Catherine Street, the city's busiest commercial artery. Other major streets include Sherbrooke, René Lévesque Boulevard, Peel, Mountain Street, De Maisonneuve Boulevard and Crescent Street.
Old Montreal.
Old Montreal "(French: Vieux-Montréal)" is a historic area located southeast of downtown containing many different attractions such as the Old Port of Montreal, Place Jacques-Cartier, Montreal City Hall, the Bonsecours Market, Place d'Armes, Pointe-à-Callière Museum, the Notre-Dame de Montréal Basilica, and the Montreal Science Centre.
Architecture and cobbled streets in Old Montreal have been maintained or restored and are frequented by horse-drawn calèches carrying tourists. Old Montreal is accessible from the downtown core via the underground city and is served by several STM bus routes and metro stations, ferries to the South Shore and a network of bicycle paths.
The riverside area adjacent to Old Montreal is known as the Old Port. The Old Port was the former site of the worldwide Port of Montreal, but its shipping operations have been moved further east to its current larger site, leaving the former location as a recreational and historical area maintained by Parks Canada. The new Port of Montreal is now Canada's largest container port and the largest inland port on Earth.
Chinatown.
Montreal has a small but active Chinatown just south of downtown, featuring many Chinese shops and restaurants, as well as a number of Vietnamese establishments. Several of these restaurants offer dim sum from as early as 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. and can be quite crowded, especially on Sundays. The principal axes of Chinatown are Saint Laurent Boulevard and La Gauchetière Street.
Gay Village.
Montreal is known as a queer or gay-friendly city. Its pride festival, Divers/Cité, is claimed to be one of the largest in North America; organizers estimate that it drew 1.4 million people in 2002. It benefits from financial support from all three levels of government. Montreal is home to one of the largest gay villages in the world. Gay Village (known in French as "le Village gai") is centred on the downtown Beaudry metro station. Montreal is a centre of Queer life and culture in Canada and hosts several circuit parties every year. As the local gay publication is in French, an alternative for English visitors is GAYroute with details about Montreal's gay community in English. The 2006 World Outgames were held in Montreal. The 2001 census recorded that 6.3% of couples in the city were same-sex, the fourth highest percentage for cities in Canada.
Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension.
Park Extension.
Parc Extension or 'Parc-Ex' as it is known by the locals, is a key location of the city. It is set in the middle of Montreal and has two metro stations along with three of the main bus routes crossing through it. Its name derives from the fact that it is the neighborhood that begins at the end of a main city street; Parc avenue, therefore extending the reach of the long avenue. Some of the most notable things about Parc Extension is that it is home to a little over 100 different ethnicities yet is mostly known for its Greek community which helped make the district what it is today.
Greektown.
Montreal's Greektown has historically been located in the district of Parc Extension. Jean-Talon Boulevard, which runs through Parc Extension, is home to many Greek restaurants and shops. The same can be said for Parc Avenue. Thousands of Greek Canadians took to the streets and celebrated in Greektown after Greece defeated Portugal in the 2004 European Football Championship.
Other neighbourhoods.
Saint-Michel is the home of Le Boulevard shopping centre (recently renovated) and also is home to the headquarters of the world-renowned Cirque Du Soleil as well as the Tohu, la Cité des Arts du Cirque and the Complexe environmental Saint-Michel. The former Miron and Francon quarries are also located here. Autoroute 40 runs through the area and adds a distinctive feel to the neighborhood. Saint-Michel is one of the most ethnically diverse areas in Montreal and in the province of Quebec. Italians, Haitians, Arabs, Asians, Hispanics as well as people of French descent (Québécois) represent the major ethnic groups of this inner city area. Thus, the area has a very distinctive cultural feel. In the early 1990s, this part of Montreal was mostly known for street gang problems. Although, these problems persists somewhat to this day, the situation is better controlled and opinion of the area has improved.

Povilas Tautvaišas

Povilas Tautvaišas () (6 May 1916 in Mogilev – November 1980 in Chicago) was a Lithuanian-American chess master.
Biography.
He played twice for the Lithuanian team in the Chess Olympiads, at eighth board (+4 –8 =2) at Munich 1936 (unofficial Olympiad), and at fourth board (+5 –9 =6) in the 8th Olympiad at Buenos Aires 1939, during which World War II broke out. Tautvaisas returned to Europe and took 5th, behind Birmanas, Arlauskas, Abramavičius, and Vaitonis, at the 1943 Lithuanian chess championship in Vilnius.
At the end of the war, Tautvaišas, along with many other Baltic players, escaped to the West, ahead of the advancing Soviet forces. There were many tournaments organized in Germany in the late 1940s, and most of these consisted of Germans and "displaced persons" - mostly from the Baltics. Tautvaišas took 3rd, behind Arlauskas and Endzelins, in the "Baltic Displaced Persons" (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) championship, which was held in Blomberg. In 1946, he tied for 3rd-4th with Sämisch, behind Unzicker and Zemgalis, in Augsburg. In 1947, he took 12th in Kirchheim-Teck. In 1948, he tied for 3rd-5th in Esslingen. In 1948, he won in Oldenburg.
Tautvaisas then moved to Boston in 1949, then finally to Chicago in 1950. He was many-time Chicago and Illinois champion, and his prominence in the Chicago area in the 1950s and 1960s earned him the nickname "The Old Fox". In 1956, he tied for 2nd-3rd with Arthur Bisguier, behind Donald Byrne, in Detroit (Tartakower Memorial). In 1957, he tied for 3rd-5th in Milwaukee (New Western Open). In 1957, he tied for 6th-16th in Milwaukee (North-Central Open). In 1958, he tied for 2nd-3rd with Theodorovych, behind Pal Benko, in Milwaukee (NCO). In 1959, he took 19th in Milwaukee (Western Open).

First strike (coinage)

First strike is a marketing term used by third party coin grading services which refers to coins which were struck first by a mint. The U.S. Mint maintains that there is no widely accepted and standardized numismatic industry definition of First Strike coins. Several coin grading companies have decided that a "first strike" coin is one that shipped from the mint in the first month of the new minting. 
No U.S. Mint First Strike Program.
The U.S. Mint has stated that they do not keep track of which coins were struck first. The mint has dates on the packaging for the coins, however they also state that the shipping dates do not reveal exactly when the coins were struck.
Lawsuit.
In 2006 a Miami lawyer filed a 10 million dollar lawsuit in a Miami court, alleging the "First Strike" label is deceptive. The lawsuit was filed against the two coin grading companies: Numismatic Guaranty Corp., (NGC) based in Sarasota, Fla., and Professional Coin Grading Service, (PCGS) of Newport Beach, California.
In 2007 NGC settled the lawsuit by paying money to collectors and the attorneys. They also designated 447,500 dollars for consumer education.
Marketing.
The lawsuit revealed that the designation of "First strike" is essentially a successful marketing tool. There is essentially no way to know when a coin was struck. While PCGS retains the use of the term, NGC has changed their designation from "first strike" to a more accurate description: "Early Release".

<doc id="7018529" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7018529" title="Old Mackinac Point Light">
Old Mackinac Point Light

Old Mackinac Point Light is a deactivated lighthouse located at the northern tip of the Lower Peninsula in the U.S. state of Michigan. The lighthouse is part of Fort Michilimackinac State Park in the village of Mackinaw City just east of the Mackinac Bridge.
The lighthouse was constructed in 1892 along the Straits of Mackinac at the junction of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. It was deactivated in 1957 and currently serves as a museum.
History.
Preparations.
Even before the advent of European explorers, the Straits of Mackinac were a significant hazard to water borne travelers. Consequently, before lighthouses, the Ojibwa lit the shore with fires.
In the early 19th century, with large vessel traffic increasing from Lake Huron into the Straits, the first step in guarding the Straits was taken in 1829, through the construction of Bois Blanc Lighthouse to both guide mariners in making the westerly turn into the Straits, and to warn them of the shoals and shallows surrounding the island.
Three years later in 1832, Congress acted on Stephen Pleasonton’s recommendation that a lightship be placed on Waugoshance Shoal as the first attempt to mark the western entrance to the Straits. In 1838, Lieutenant James T. Homans reported that the lightship was wholly inadequate. He recommended a better solution for Waugoshance and also that a light be built on the point to the west of Mackinaw Harbor. Nothing came of Homans' recommendations. In 1854, the new Lighthouse Administration decided (against the recommendation of local residents) to put a light at McGulpin Point, approximately to the west of Old Point Mackinaw.
Construction.
In 1889, the United States Lighthouse Board realized that Mackinaw Point was a better location. Their first inclination was to put a fog signal there, but when asking Congress for funding, they requested funding for both a fog signal and a first class lighthouse. Congress chose to accept their recommendation, but only voted the funding for a steam-powered fog-signal. The fog signal was built in 1890. The signal proved to be exceptionally necessary for navigation in the often fog-choked Straits of Mackinac; during one exceptionally humid fortnight, the Old Mackinac Point signal personnel reported burning 52 cords of stove wood in order to keep steam up for the foghorn.
The lighthouse "grew out of the fog station." In March 1891, Congress finally authorized the funding for a light station and the board acted quickly. Bidding was difficult, but in 1892, "on a foundation of ashlar limestone, the tower and attached keeper’s dwelling were both constructed of Cream City brick, trimmed with Indiana Limestone, by general contractor John Peter Schmitt of Detroit. The double-walled cylindrical tower was laid with an outside diameter of , and as each course was added, rose to a height of , surmounted by a circular iron gallery and an diameter watch room, which was in turn capped by a prefabricated octagonal iron lantern." The lens is a fourth order Fresnel Lens.
Its light was visible for , which made it "particularly valuable" to the railroad car ferries SS "Chief Wawatam" and SS "Sainte Marie" operated between Mackinaw City and St. Ignace.
Deactivation and preservation.
The completion of the Mackinac Bridge in 1957 eliminated the need for the light. Since the Mackinac Bridge has lights on it at night, the bridge became a much better aid to navigation than the light.
In 1960, the lighthouse property was purchased by the Mackinac Island State Park Commission, incorporating it into surrounding Fort Michilimackinac State Park. The Old Mackinac Point Lighthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in November 1969, as Reference #69000068 (listed as: Mackinac Point Lighthouse).
It is also a registered Michigan Historic Landmark. The Michigan Historical Marker on site, erected in 1977 as Registered Site S-0377, states:
"Mackinac Point Light. This lighthouse is opposite the turning point for ships making the difficult passage through the Straits of Mackinac, one of the busiest crossroads of the Great Lakes. McGulpin Point Light, two miles to the west, had been established in 1856, but it was not visible from all directions. In 1889 Congress appropriated funds for the construction of a steam-powered fog signal here, which went into operation on November 5, 1890. Construction of the light tower and attached lightkeepers' dwelling began, and the light was first displayed on October 25, 1892. Heavy iron and brass castings were used throughout the structure, and the light was visible to ships sixteen miles away. In operation until 1958, the lighthouse is now a maritime museum."
In 2000, serious restoration was undertaken, with the intent of restoring it to its appearance around 1910. The lighthouse complex, including the lightkeeper's quarters and tower, was reopened to the public in 2004 by Mackinac State Historic Parks as part of the Fort Michilimackinac complex. The light's original Fresnel lens is on display. In addition, starting in 2018, major exterior and interior masonry restoration was undertaken by National Restoration Inc. The castle-style structure, which design is unique in the Great Lakes was restored. 
As a result of these restorations, the first floor is fully accessible, and includes period furnishings and accoutrement, plus hands-on exhibits that test one's nighttime navigation skills, light a miniature Fresnel lens, and put on Lighthouse keeper clothing. Historic interpreters lead tours up the tower and into the lantern room. An admission fee is charged.
Current status and getting there.
Adjacent to the Mackinac Bridge, the park offers a good view of the bridge and boat traffic.
Admission is through the 1907 Fog Signal Building, which houses the museum store. An admission fee is charged. Pets are welcome.
The tower is open to the public.
The lighthouse is located within Michilimackinac State Park, just a few hundred feet east of the Mackinac Bridge and the Colonial Michilimackinac Visitors Center. At this time the light is a museum run by Mackinac Parks Commission .
Because of its prime location and exposure to tourists, plus its unique picturesque form and color, it is the subject of photographs, drawings, and needlepoint illustrations. Historical photographs are a prominent feature of the Mackinac Island State Park Commission website.
An exciting and expensive alternative is to charter a seaplane to make a tour of the Mackinac Straits and environs.

Lake Waikaremoana Great Walk

The Lake Waikaremoana Great Walk is a tramping track which follows the southern and western coast of Lake Waikaremoana in the North Island of New Zealand. Passing through several types of forest, and grassland, the track often provides views over the lake. It is classified as one of New Zealand's Great Walks, and is located in the former Te Urewera National Park.
Tramping.
The trailheads are at Onepoto, and Hopuruahine, on the southern and northern edges of the lake respectively. Most people take 3 to 4 days to complete the trail.
The trail passes through several areas of private land, and touches the edge of the Puketukutuku Peninsula Kiwi Refuge.
The Department of Conservation provides very conservative estimates on the hiking time from point to point on the track, and experienced hikers may cover quoted distances in half of the recommended time.
Transport.
As this track is not a circuit, transport is needed between the start and end of the trail. Most trampers use the services of one of the local shuttle bus or shuttle boat operators who can deliver and pick up trampers at pre-arranged times. The start and end of the trail are both on State Highway 38.
There is a motor camp at Home Bay (Whanganui o parua Inlet), near the Āniwaniwa Visitor Centre. All the huts/campsites are also accessible by boat, except for Panekire Hut, and there are several boat-ramps along State Highway 38.
Location.
The Lake Waikaremoana Great Walk is located within the now-disestablished Te Urewera National Park. The nearest town to the trail is Wairoa, from where there are shuttles on demand to the lake.
Waikaremoana can be approached from two directions. State Highway 38 links Wairoa and the East Coast with the central North Island and passes the lake and the Āniwaniwa Visitor Centre. The highway is unsealed for about 80 kilometres between Murupara and the village of Tuai. There are well-marked side roads to the main boat ramps and Lake Track entrances.

American Megafauna

American Megafauna is a board game on the topic of evolution designed by Phil Eklund, and published by Sierra Madre Games in 1997. While the game is not an attempt to be a simulation, a variety of genuine evolutionary factors are incorporated in the game, ranging from Milankovich cycles to dentition. The game can be played in a solitaire mode as well as multi-player. It has subsequently gone out of print.
In late 2011, Bios: Megafauna was released by Sierra Madre Games, essentially as a replacement for "American Megafauna". This is a more streamlined version of "American Megafauna", using some of the same design concepts, and being much more accessible. Playing time was reduced also, yet this new release retains its strong solitaire mode, as well as accommodating 2-4 players. It is a semi-scientific simulation in the same vein as Sierra Madre Games' 2010 popular release, High Frontier (board game).
The game begins after the Permian-Triassic extinction event of 250 million years ago, which killed off 95% of all living species on Earth. Players can choose to begin the game as one of 4 Archetype species that start as herbivores, but can mutate into predators. Both mammals and dinosaurs are represented. There is a huge (almost endless) variety of species that can evolve via DNA chains, and the random tile map board setup is constantly changing due to certain random events (e.g., Erosion, Greenhouse and icehouse Earth, and Milankovich cycles), Catastrophes (e.g., an Impact event or a solar flare), and the addition of new Biome tiles during play.
The map itself (represented by tiles that are turned over and revealed) consists of a wide variety of land, sea, mountain, and other Biomes in four different latitudes. The goal of the game is to adapt your DNA, speciate, and survive amidst both environmental and living animal competition (represented by other players and wandering Immigrant animals that encroach upon the continent). Play time varies between 60–180 minutes depending on the number of participants and various rules being utilized.
The next projected title in the series, Bios: Genesis (abiogenisis, the origins of life on Earth) is scheduled for a 2016 release.

Hamilton Bohannon

Hamilton Frederick Bohannon (March 7, 1942 – April 24, 2020), often credited and known professionally simply as Bohannon, was an American drummer, percussionist, band leader, songwriter, arranger, and record producer, who was one of the leading figures in 1970s funk and disco music. He worked with Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, the Temptations, Wah Wah Watson, Ray Parker Jr., the Counts and Carolyn Crawford.
Life and career.
He was born in Newnan, Georgia, and learned the drums at school. He began playing in local bands, one of which featured guitarist Jimi Hendrix, before graduating from Clark College with a degree in music and secondary education. After a brief period as a schoolteacher, he was recruited in 1964 as drummer in 13-year-old Stevie Wonder's touring band. He moved to Detroit in 1967, where he was employed by Motown as the leader and arranger of Bohannon &amp; The Motown Sound, who provided backing for many of the label's top acts on tour, including Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, the Temptations, Diana Ross and the Supremes, the Four Tops and others.
When Motown moved from Detroit to Los Angeles, Bohannon stayed behind to form his own ensemble, featuring members of local band The Fabulous Counts and including such musicians as Ray Parker Jr. and Dennis Coffey. He signed in 1972 with the Dakar label run by producer Carl Davis, and released his debut album "Stop &amp; Go" in early 1973. This was followed by five more albums for the label over the next two years, on which he "perfected his formula of heavy, thudding bass accents and aggressive rhythms". Although several of his tracks were club hits, he had limited chart success. His first hit single, in 1974, was "South African Man", which reached No. 78 on the "Billboard" R&amp;B chart, but had more success in the UK, where it reached No. 22 on the UK Singles Chart. This was followed up in 1975 by "Foot Stompin Music" – his only record to reach the US "Billboard" Hot 100 – and "Disco Stomp", his biggest hit in the UK where it reached No. 6, and was later cited by Johnny Marr as a major influence on the Smiths’ song “How Soon Is Now?”
In 1976, Bohannon signed with Mercury Records and two years later had one of his biggest successes with "Let’s Start the Dance", which reached No. 9 on the R&amp;B chart and No. 7 on the disco chart. "Let's Start the Dance" featured singer Carolyn Crawford, whose subsequent albums Bohannon went on to produce. In 1981, a new mix of "Let's Start the Dance" was successful on the dance chart. In 1980, he established Phase II Records, and continued to have minor hits on the R&amp;B chart for the next three years, using new vocalists Liz Lands and Altrinna Grayson. He signed with MCA Records in 1984 and released several more albums. His last album, "It's Time to Jam", was issued on the South Bound label in 1990.
Much of his music has been widely sampled, most notably on Chicago DJ/producer Paul Johnson's 1999 hit "Get Get Down" which heavily sampled Bohannon's "Me and the Gang". Other musicians who have used samples of his music include Jay Z, Digable Planets, and Snoop Dogg. His name was also repeatedly invoked in the Tom Tom Club song "Genius of Love". His composition "Ooh!" was included on Mary J. Blige's album "Love &amp; Life" in 2003.
In later years Bohannon produced a new singer, Governor, on Atlantic Records, as well as working on material with his son, Hamilton Bohannon II, and publishing an audiobook memoir of his early years in the music business, "Bohannon Speaks from the Beginning".
Bohannon was a devout Christian and dedicated his album "Dance Your Ass Off" to "God, my master, savior and Jesus Christ". The album also included a disclaimer that "Dance Your Ass Off is not used in the sense of profanity."
In 2017, Peachtree Street in Newnan was renamed Bohannon Drive by the city council in his honor.
He died on April 24, 2020, at his home in Atlanta at the age of 78.

David Massey (music executive)

David Massey is a British-born, American record executive and former artist manager. Massey previously served as president of Universal Music Group's Mercury Records from 2007 until 2013, when he was named president/CEO of Universal's Island Records.
Massey left Island in June 2018 to be President and CEO of Arista Records as part of a new partnership between Sony Music and Massey. Under Arista Records, Massey established and oversees Work of Art Publishing, Work of Art Management and last nite records, the label’s global music and research subsidiary.
Personal life.
Massey was born in London to Gerald Massey and Marion Massey. Marion was the manager of British pop star Lulu from the singer's discovery in 1963 until the end of the 1980s, and she is known as one of the first female artist managers in the music industry.
Massey's early schooling was at the Lycée Francais de Londres, followed by a master's degree in Law at Christ's College Cambridge University, where he was also president of the Law Society.
He married Gaby Gryn in 1987 and they have two children, Adam and Clio. The family moved to New York City in January 1992, where they continue to reside.
Career.
Massey began his career in the music industry in 1982 as an artist manager, firstly representing the British new wave group, Wang Chung – who signed with Geffen and enjoyed five US Top 40 singles. His client roster also included Tom Robinson, Hollywood Beyond, Siedah Garrett, and also prolific British songwriter/producers Tony Swain and Steve Jolley. In addition to artist representation, Massey also ran a small independent label and music publishing company called Big World Records. “When I was a manager back in the day,” he tells "HITS", “I was always involved in the A&amp;R of my bands. My management company was A&amp;R-driven in terms of our involvement, which is probably why I ended up doing A&amp;R.” 
In 1991 Massey left management following the acceptance of an offer from Tommy Mottola and Michele Anthony to join Sony Entertainment as Vice-President of A&amp;R at Epic Records, rising to Executive Vice President/General Manager of the label in 1997.
During this time, he worked with Oasis, Silverchair, Shakira, Des'ree, Franz Ferdinand, among others. Massey became Executive Vice President of A&amp;R for Sony Music in 1999, focusing on Global A&amp;R. He also founded and became President of Daylight Records, a Sony imprint and home to such artists as Anastacia, Delta Goodrem, Good Charlotte, The Jonas Brothers, Phantom Planet and Cyndi Lauper.
Massey left Sony in April 2007 to join the Universal Music Group as president of Mercury Records. The label had been dormant in the United States since 1996 and was revived under his leadership. During his time at Mercury Records, the label released albums by Neon Trees, The Wanted, The Gaslight Anthem, Duffy, Portishead, Parachute, Jessie James, and Taio Cruz. Massey also oversaw releases by Island Records artists The Killers and Fall Out Boy.
In February 2013, Massey was appointed to the dual position of President and CEO of Island Records. Recent additions to the Island roster include Avicii, American Authors, Bishop Briggs, Nick Jonas, Tove Lo, Shawn Mendes, Elton John, Mike Posner, and Keke Palmer among others. During Massey's tenure at Island, the label has relaunched the 4th &amp; Broadway imprint to focus on dance music, which includes signings Kiesza, Sam Feldt, and Ansolo.
Since 2013, Massey has served as a trustee for the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences.
In 2018, Sony Music CEO Rob Stringer announced Massey would lead the relaunch of Arista Records. Massey developed the relaunch as a model-designed entertainment company - part record label, part publishing and part management. Under Massey’s leadership, Arista Records’ roster includes GRAMMY-nominated artist, JP Saxe, Måneskin, Princess Nokia, Tai Verdes, as well as emerging artists such as, KennyHoopla, UPSAHL, carolesdaughter, and Audrey Nuna.
David was recently named one of the "most powerful and influential figures in the music business" by HITS Magazine and has been included on Billboard’s Power 100 list for six consecutive years.

<doc id="7018603" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7018603" title="Nikon F90">
Nikon F90

The Nikon F90 (known as the N90 in the United States) is a 35mm SLR camera manufactured in Japan between 1992 and 2001 and replaced the earlier Nikon F-801 (N8008 in the U.S.). At the time of its release it was noted for its fast autofocus speed compared to previous Nikon models, which had lagged behind competitor Canon's. It was thus seen by many as a 'stop-gap' measure to prevent the mass migration of many Nikon-using professional photographers to Canon, as Nikon's next fully professional camera, the F5, was some time away from release. The Nikon F4, the professional model available at the time of the F90's release, had very slow autofocus compared to Canon's autofocus SLRs.
The Nikon F90's autofocus system was driven by a small 'peanut' motor in the camera body that drove the lens via a mechanical link, unlike Canon's autofocus system, which used motors built into each lens. It was also the first Nikon SLR to interoperate with the first generation of Nikkor lenses featuring internal focusing motor.
Despite not being intended for the professional market, the Nikon F90 and its upgrade, the F90x, were built to a high standard and were (and are still) used by many professionals.
However, many F90 and F90x bodies had problems with the rubberized back, where the rubberized coating would start peeling or disintegrating into a surface sticky to the touch. The rubber around the grip and other parts were not affected. This did not affect the functionality of the back but was a nuisance to users.
The rubberised coating can however be removed (Once the door has been unclipped and safely removed from the camera body) by rubbing gently with a microfibre towel or similar soaked in plenty of isopropyl alcohol. This procedure will remove the rubberised top coating without affecting the surface finish of the underlying plastic or the clear film viewing window. The white printed "Vari Program" icons will remain unaffected also. The end result is a hard semi-gloss finish the same as the camera's top plate.
The Nikon F90x (known in the United States as the N90s) was a slightly upgraded version of the F90. Differences included faster and more accurate autofocus and shutter speed adjustments in thirds of a stop versus the full-stop increments of the F90. Frame rate was also increased, along with several other minor upgrades. Weather sealing was also improved. In addition, it eliminated the beeping function of the F90.
Accessories.
Nikon N90, F90, N90s and F90x had some accessories that improve the use of these cameras.
The optional MB-10 battery grip which takes 4 AA batteries and which fits on to the base of the camera was also introduced. The MB-10 added a vertical-grip shutter release and provides a larger grip area which is especially useful when a large lens is attached to the body. The MB-10 will fully work only on the F90x and N90s models. Plain N90 and F90 models will receive and mount the MB10, but the vertical shutter controls will not work as they lack the necessary internal electrical contacts in the battery chamber.
As the MB-10 operates from exactly the same 4 "AA" cells as the camera body alone, there is no increase in continuous shooting speed or AF speed as in some cameras such as the F4 / F4S. The grip is simply a convenience and handling feature. The operational speed, battery duration and frame rate of the F90X remain identical either with or without the MB-10.
The MF-26 data back, allows the user to change the camera's configuration on demand and without using a PC, and creates a powerful set for film photography. The fully programmable MF-26 expands camera's option including multiple exposure, interval &amp; delay mode, very long exposure times (up to 12h), and can be non-continuous if set on automatic, world time zones, flash exposure bracketing and data imprinting.
The F90 (and subsequent F90x) features a 10-pin remote release socket. The MC-30 is available as a corded remote release and the ML-3 offered as a wireless option. The older MC-20 is also available.
A minor annoyance with the camera is that the cover caps for the remote-control socket and PC Sync sockets are not tethered to the body, and so are very easy to lose or misplace in use. Fortunately, these caps are common to many Nikon models (F100, D2, etc.) and so are readily and cheaply available.
Compatibility.
The F90/F90x uses lenses with the Nikon F mount.
It is the first camera to support 3D TTL flash metering with D lenses.
Newer G lenses without aperture rings only fully function under shutter priority and program modes. It does work under manual or aperture priority, however only at the minimum aperture.
Newer VR lenses will work without VR functionality on this camera.
Unlike the earlier F-801/F-801s, the F90/F90x supports autofocus with the AF-I/AF-S series lenses with built-in motors.
DX lenses are not recommended as they do not cover the full 35mm frame and will lead to vignetting; however they still will function if use is desired.
Manual focus lenses will work if they are AI or AI converted, albeit with only center weighted and spot metering available. The arrows on the bottom left hand corner of the viewfinder are used to check focus. AI-P lenses, however, will enable matrix metering. non-AI lenses will damage the camera if mounted and the user should not attempt to mount these.
Kodak DCS 400.
In collaboration with Nikon, Kodak used F90 and F90s bodies as the basis for the Kodak DCS 400 series of digital SLRs. The DCS 410 and early DCS 420 models used the F90 (badged as N90), and the later DCS 420, DCS 460, and NC2000 used the F90x (badged N90s). The cameras were mounted, with minor modifications, on a Kodak digital back.
The Kodak/Nikon N90S-based digital camera system was purchased by NASA and used on both the Space Shuttle programs and on the International Space Station.

Sokoľany

Sokoľany is a village and municipality in Košice-okolie District in the Košice Region of eastern Slovakia. Between 1961 and 1990, it was connected with its neighbouring village, Bočiar, forming the village of Hutníky.
History.
Name.
The name likely comes from the word "sokol" (falcon), which is supported by documents as early as 1251 (villa Zocol). The village became Hungarianized and the name changed (e.g. Sokol, Zakul, Szakaly, Abaújszakaly).
Geography.
The village lies in the south of the Košice basin on the Sokolianský potok. The cleared land is on the terrace plateau of the Hornád River, the western part on the alluvial cone of the Ida stream, deposited on Tertiary sediments.
The municipality covers 385,82 hectares, of which 32,61 hectares are built-up. The built-up area is at an altitude of up to 300 m above sea level (specifically between 204 and 213 m above sea level) with a maximum slope of up to 8,5%.
The territory lies in a continental climate zone characterized as warm, moderately humid, with cold winters. Annual rainfall 600 mm, moisture deficit 284 mm. Soil type is brown earth on loess and loess loams.
Sokoliansky potok (brook).
In the past it originated in Zlatá Idka, dividing Sokoľany into 2 sides, east and west (named Kis Szakaly and Nagy Szakaly on the cadastral map of 1869 (small and large Sokoľany) At that time it was much larger, in the meadow “Berek” south of the village it drove the Sokoliansky mill, and fed several manor ponds, which were owned by the local landowners. In 1868 was the mill dismantled and the ponds gradually dried up.
Government.
The village relies on the tax and district offices and fire brigade at Košice.
Transport.
The nearest railway station is located 1 kilometre away.

Glass tile

Glass tiles are pieces of glass formed into consistent shapes.
Early history.
Glass was used in mosaics as early as 2500 BC, but it was not until the 3rd century BC that innovative artisans in Greece, Persia, and India created glass tiles.
Whereas clay tile is dated as early as 8,000 BC, there were significant barriers to the development of glass tile, including the high temperatures required to melt glass and the complexities of annealing glass curves.
In recent years, glass tiles have become popular for both field tile and accent tiles. This trend can be attributed to recent technological breakthroughs, as well as the tiles inherent properties; in particular, their potential to impart intense color, reflect light, and remain impervious to water.
Glass tile introduces complexities to the installer. Since glass is more rigid than ceramic or porcelain tile, glass tiles break more readily under the duress of substrate shifts.
Smalti tiles.
"Smalti tile", sometimes referred to as "Byzantine glass mosaic tile", is a typically opaque glass tile originally developed for use in mosaics created during the time of the Byzantine Empire.
Smalti is made by mixing molten glass with metal oxides for color in a furnace; the result is a cloudy mixture poured into flat slabs that are cooled and broken into individual pieces. The molten mixture can be topped with gold leaf, followed by a thin glass film to protect against tarnishing. During the Byzantine era, Constantinople became the center of the mosaic craft, and the use of gold leaf glass mosaic reached perhaps its greatest artistic expression in the former seat of the Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople, the Hagia Sophia.
Traditional smalti tiles are still found today in many European churches and ornamental objects; the method is used by some present-day artisans, both in installations and fine art. In the 1920s, mass production methods were applied to Smalti tile manufacturing, which enabled these tiles to find their way into many middle-class homes. Instead of the old method of rolling the colored glass mixture out, cooling, and cutting, the new method called for molten liquid to be poured and cooled in trays, usually resulting in 3/4 inch chiclet-type pieces.
Modern era.
Since the 1990s, a variety of modern glass tile technologies, including methods to take used glass and recreate it as 'green' tiles, has resulted in a resurgence of interest in glass tile as a floor and wall cladding. It is now most commonly used in pools, kitchens, spas, and bathrooms. Although Smalti tile remains popular, small and large format glass products are now commonly formed using cast and fused glass methods. The plasticity of these last two methods has resulted in a wide variety of looks and applications, including floor tiles.
In the late 1990s, special glass tiles were coated on the back side with a receptive white coating. This has allowed impregnation of heat-transfer dyes by a printing process reproducing high resolution pictures and designs. Custom printed glass tile and glass tile murals exhibit the toughness of glass on the wearing surface with photo-like pictures. These are especially practical in kitchens and showers, where cleanser and moisture resistance are important.

RAF Warmwell

Royal Air Force Warmwell or more simply RAF Warmwell is a former Royal Air Force station near Warmwell in Dorset, England from 1937 to 1946, located about 5 miles east-southeast of Dorchester; 100 miles southwest of London.
During the Second World War it was used by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces Ninth Air Force.
History.
RAF use.
At above sea level RAF Warmwell originally opened in May 1937 as a landing ground named RAF Woodsford, for units carrying out air-to-ground firing and bombing on ranges set up off the south coast of Dorset at Chesil Bank. With the airfield code of 'XW' it was renamed RAF Warmwell in July 1938 due to possible confusion with Woodford, near Manchester, which was an airfield where Avro was producing the Lancaster bomber. After the use by squadrons using the ranges diminished, and as the Second World War started more and more units were based here to act as fighter defence for the important naval facilities at Portland and Portsmouth, as well as working in 10 Group as part of the fighter defences for the south-west of England. Warmwell's three runways remained grass-surfaced for its entire life even though as the war progressed, and the emphasis became on intruding into German-occupied Europe, many intruder units were based here, using the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane and Tempest, and the Westland Whirlwind, the first twin-engined heavy fighter for the RAF.
The following units were also here at some point:
USAAF use.
Although USAAF-marked aircraft were seen at Warmwell from July 1942 it was not until March 1944 that the base came under American control. While under USAAF control, Warmwell was known as USAAF Station AAF-454 for security reasons, and by which it was referred to instead of location.
474th Fighter Group.
The 474th Fighter Group arrived on 12 March 1944 from Oxnard Flight Strip California flying Lockheed P-38 "Lightnings". Operational squadrons of the group were:
Resumed RAF use.
The 474th was a group of Ninth Air Force's 70th Fighter Wing, IX Tactical Air Command which left for the Continent in August 1944, and the RAF once more assumed control of the airfield. After the last RAF squadrons to be based there left and Armament Practice Camps stopped using the ranges by October 1945 the station went onto Care and Maintenance the following month before closing down. During the immediate post-war years the hangars were used for food storage but this was not quite the end for the airfield, for during the extensive test programme for the Westland Wyvern, company test pilot Harald Penrose had to make a force-landing on the obstructed and overgrown surface. 
 
Current use.
The airfield proper has for many years been occupied by a quarry which has effectively removed all trace of the flying field, whilst the site on which the technical site once lay is now a small village called Crossways, the original northern taxiway being still in use as a road through the village where two dispersal pans and the old ATC tower (albeit heavily converted to a public dwelling - Egdon House) still remain, and the old station cinema is now the . still remain, rumoured to be used by local farmers for fertilizer storage, plus an Over Blister hangar (one of eight built during the war) and other buildings exist in the woodland areas surrounding Crossways, although some have been demolished. One of the base's billets is now one of the local shops, and at the junction of Mount Skippet Way and Airfield Close in Crossways village housing is a memorial to the airfield, located in a grassed recreational area. During recent clearance work in preparation for new buildings on the North East side of the old airfield a brick block house and a concrete rifle range were revealed. Both have now been demolished but the photographs shown were taken just prior to their removal. Further clearances to build an access road across the south-east corner of the flying field has also resulted in the excavation of a group of the aircraft tie-down points.

Tomasz Majewski

Tomasz Majewski (born 30 August 1981) is a Polish shot putter and a double Olympic gold medalist (2008 Beijing, 2012 London). He is the third shot putter to successfully defend the Olympic title, first European to do so, and the first since Parry O'Brien in 1956. He also won the silver medal at the 2009 World Athletics Championships and gold medal at the 2010 European Athletics Championships.
Career.
Majewski stands at 204 cm (6' 8") tall and weighs 140 kg (300 lb).
During the Olympic final in Beijing on 15 August 2008, he threw 21.51 meters for the gold medal, Poland's first Olympic medal in shot put since 1972 when the late Władysław Komar took the gold. Majewski was also the first Pole to win gold at the 2008 Olympics.
On 25 July 2009 in Barcelona he threw a personal best of 21.64 m and few days later in DN Galan in Stockholm, Sweden he improved upon this with a throw of 21.95 m, a new Polish record.
At the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships he threw a personal best and Polish indoor record of 21.20 m. However, the level of competition was so high that this was only enough for fifth place behind a Canadian record-breaking Dylan Armstrong. It was the first time in championships history that five men had gone beyond the 21 m mark.
In the outdoor season, Majewski competed at the 2010 European Athletics Championships and won the shot put silver medal. His 21-metre throw was beaten by a single centimetre as Andrei Mikhnevich took the title. He had shoulder surgery in the latter half of the year. Focusing on the 2011 season, he said that the strong form of his opponents was more of an inspiration than an obstacle: "Christian Cantwell and Reese Hoffa [both] went over 22 metres last year, the good performances of my rivals doesn't make me angry or worried, instead it acts as the best sort of motivation to get up to their level".
At the 2011 European Team Championships he was the silver medallist behind David Storl and while his young German rival went on to win at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, Majewski managed only ninth place with a best throw of 20.18 m. At the start of 2012 he broke his own Polish indoor record at the BW-Bank Meeting in Karlsruhe with a winning mark of 21.27 m. In London 2012 he won the gold medal with a mark of 21.89 m and he became the first male shot-put thrower to defend his Olympic title since Parry O'Brien achieved that in Melbourne 1956.
Hobbies.
His hobbies include basketball and playing video games.
National honours.
For his sport achievements, he received:&lt;br&gt;
 Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (5th Class) in 2008.&lt;br&gt;
 Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (4th Class) in 2009.

Margarita Cordova

Margarita Cordova (born February 26, 1939, in Saginaw, Michigan) is a retired American dancer and actress.
Early life.
Cordova was born in Saginaw, Michigan, but grew up in Mexico City. When she was 14, she moved to Los Angeles.
Career.
Stage and dancing.
In 1958, Cordova and her husband Clark Allen opened for a show starring Jean Arnold at the Cabaret Concert Theatre in Los Angeles. "Variety" described the couple as "Spanish dance exponents who take the trouble to explain what they're doing during their 30-minute stint. Education has not always been at home in a nitery, but it's a pleasure here [...] the team divides its work with the male member flicking the Spanish guitar and singing..."
In 1960, Cordova and Allen had a 30-minute show in New York. "Variety" wrote: "Although likeable (sic) in their current New York debut at Julius Monk's Downstairs at the Upstairs, they're not particularly outstanding. It could be that Allen's folksong selection lacks a powerhouse item".
In 1962, Cordova and Allen opened and operated El Cid, a flamenco nightclub on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.
Cordova and Allen performed traditional Spanish and Mexican song and dance at other venues in the Los Angeles area, including Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City and at the Ebell of Los Angeles Theater.
Television.
Cordova has made numerous guest appearances on several television series from the 1960s, including "The Twilight Zone" episode "A Thing About Machines" and a 1960 episode of "Peter Gunn" entitled "Cry Love, Cry Murder". Her other television credits include "Playhouse 90", "The Chevy Mystery Show", "Cheyenne", "The Lloyd Bridges Show", "The Farmer's Daughter", "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.", "The Flying Nun", "The Big Valley", "Gunsmoke", "The Virginian (TV series)", "", "The Mod Squad", "Marcus Welby, M.D.", "Lou Grant", "Police Story", "T.J. Hooker" and "Dallas".
Cordova had a contract role on NBC's short-living soap opera "Sunset Beach" as Carmen Torres from 1997 to 1999, receiving ALMA Award nomination for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Soap Opera in 1999. She also played Rosa Andrade on "Santa Barbara" from 1984 to 1987, and from 1991 to 1993. In 2000s, she made guest appearances on "Strong Medicine" and "Criminal Minds".
Film.
Cordova appeared in "One-Eyed Jacks" (1961) as a flamenco dancer. She also had bit parts in "Pay or Die!" (1960), "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" (1962) and "Guns of Diablo" (1965).
Personal life.
Cordova was married to musician, actor, and artist Clark Allen. They met in Paris. They studied in Granada, Spain for more than a year where they learned the culture of the Spanish Romani and flamenco music. The couple had two children: a daughter named Angela, who became a fine artist, and a son named David, who became a professional musician and photographer. Angela and David were members of the 1970s band Carmen. Cordova and Allen later divorced.

Jianquan Taijiquan Association

The Jianquan Taijiquan Association () is a well known school teaching Wu-style tai chi.
It was founded in 1935 by Wu Jianquan in Shanghai, and in the beginning operated out of the Shanghai YMCA. In 1937 Wu Kung-tsao opened a school in the British colony of Hong Kong during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) in response to the ban on Chinese martial arts instituted by the Japanese. In 1942, when Wu Jianquan died, his oldest son Wu Gongyi became head of the Association, eventually moving its headquarters to the Hong Kong school where it has continued uninterrupted to this day. In English the Hong Kong branch and its subsidiaries call themselves "Wu's T'ai Chi Ch'uan Academies."
Wu Jianquan's daughter Wu Yinghua and his eldest disciple Ma Yueliang led the branch in Shanghai after 1949. The Shanghai school fell under the ban on "feudalistic practices" with the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. Only in 1980 were they able to officially reopen.

<doc id="7018692" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7018692" title="Swahili culture">
Swahili culture

Swahili culture is the culture of the Swahili people inhabiting the Swahili coast. This littoral area encompasses Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique, as well as the adjacent islands of Zanzibar and Comoros along with some parts of Malawi and the eastern part of Democratic Republic of Congo. Swahili people speak Swahili as their native language, which belongs to the Bantu language family. Graham Connah described Swahili culture as at least partially urban, mercantile, and literate.
Swahili culture is the product of the history of the coastal part of the African Great Lakes region. As with the Swahili language, Swahili culture has a Bantu core that has borrowed from foreign influences.
History and identity.
The medieval sites along the Swahili coast represent a cultural tradition with diverse local traditions dating the ninth century CE. This has developed into the modern Swahili culture. Currently, there are 173 identified settlements that flourished along the Swahili coast and nearby islands from the ninth to the seventeenth centuries, which include the sites of Kilwa, Malindi, Gedi, Pate, Comoros, and Zanzibar. The most recent excavations at these coastal sites have been used to examine the spread of Islam in East Africa and the development of the Swahili culture. However, the identity of the Swahili (and of the people associated with and the development of the culture along the Swahili coast) has often been disputed in both the past and present. The historic use of coral among the Swahili in construction, who used stone as construction material for mosques and tombs, has been associated with the emergence of the use of coral stone for construction in the fourteenth century along the coast for buildings ascribed with the most importance. Conversely, it has been stated that the sites were founded by Arab or Persian colonists.
It has been claimed that Swahili culture emerged from the settlement of Arab merchants with the ruins being called Arab cities and with many Swahili self-identifying as descendants of Arabs or Persians. Opinions published in 2000 suggest that the medieval Swahili coastal sites developed locally with the creation of small agricultural and fishing communities that gave rise to the Swahili culture through trade that resulted in an increase in Islamic influence during the twelfth century. Increased contact with the Islamic world then would have led to the integration of local African and Arab traditions, creating an indigenous Swahili culture. A blend of these two interpretations exists with accounts of Arab merchants marrying local women, which created a distinctive Arab-African Swahili culture. The culture appears to have emerged in Kenya and Tanzania and eventually spread to Mozambique. 
Data from a study of Swahili genetics were published in 2023. The DNA of dozens of individuals buried in medieval Swahili settlements in Kenya and Tanzania between 1250 and 1800 were collected and analyzed. The research concluded that the ancient persons "genomes point to the diverse origins of Swahili culture, with people carrying a mix of local African, Middle Eastern, and South Asian ancestry" and support the accuracy of oral histories that often have been discounted about the origins of the Swahili culture. Anthropological archaeologist Chapurukha Kusimba, who co-led the study, stated that the subjects "were descended from people who began mixing around 1000. Nearly all the East African ancestry seemed to come from women, whereas most of the Asian ancestry was contributed by men from Persia" and that the results of the genetic testing support the oral traditions of Swahili people, dispelling the colonial idea that Swahili civilization is or ever was “essentially an Arab civilization”. 
The early Swahili city-states followed Islam and were cosmopolitan and politically independent of each other. The chief exports of these cultures were slaves, salt, ebony, gold, ivory, and sandalwood. These city-states began to decline toward the sixteenth century, mainly as a consequence of the advent of the Portuguese. Eventually, Swahili trading centers went out of business, and commerce between Africa and Asia on the Indian Ocean collapsed.
Historic Swahili culture was urban and dominated by a strict class structure.
Aspects of Swahili culture are diverse due to its many influences. For example, Swahili cuisine has influences from Indian and Arabic cultures. There are alterations to certain dishes due to religious reasons. Some food items common in everyday lives of the Swahili are fish, tropical fruits, and exotic spices.
Arts and crafts.
Another cultural aspect of the Swahili is their use of arts and crafts, which they find to be significant. When creating art, they express themselves through creativity as well as through shape and function. Swahili art, furniture, and architecture reflect multicultural influences. They usually refrain from the use of designs with images of living beings due to their Muslim heritage. Instead, Swahili designs are primarily geometric. 
There are important clothes that are part of their arts and crafts such as the Kanga. The Kanga is not only a rectangular piece of cloth, but is an artifact of the Swahili culture. The cloth is made with extreme care and should relate to the season. For instance, if the cloth doesn’t match the season, then it is unfit to be a Kanga and may instead be used as a baby diaper or an apron for the kitchen. Even though the Kanga is quite inexpensive, it is still a main part of Swahili culture. Kangas are made in Tanzania and are mostly appealing to women rather than men, but men are not restricted from using it. The textile is also used as a sling to carry babies, carry melons on a wearer’s head, and may also be used as a kitchen apron.
Music.
The most typical musical genre of Swahili culture is taarab (or tarabu), sung in the Swahili language. Its melodies and orchestration have Arab and Indian influences, although Western instruments, such as accordions or guitars, are sometimes used.
In the 20th century several musical genres emerged in the Swahili world, and they are derivatives of Western popular music. One major example is muziki wa dansi, which is the Tanzanian counterpart of Congolese soukous (rumba). In the last decades of the century, most Swahili music was in the afropop vein, which includes several local derivatives of American hip hop (e.g., bongo flava).

Multics Emacs

Multics Emacs is an early implementation of the Emacs text editor. It was written in Maclisp by Bernard Greenberg at Honeywell's Cambridge Information Systems Lab in 1978, as a successor to the original 1976 TECO implementation of Emacs and a precursor of later GNU Emacs.
It has been claimed to be the first version of Emacs to be written in the Lisp programming language, although the same claim has also been made for the Lisp Machine editors EINE and ZWEI, also written in the late 1970s. As well as the editor itself being written in Lisp, user-supplied extensions were also written in Lisp. The choice of Lisp provided more extensibility than ever before, and has been followed by most subsequent Emacs implementations.
Rather than using TECO's gap buffer representation for the text being edited, it used a doubly linked list of lines of text.

File transfer

File transfer is the transmission of a computer file through a communication channel from one computer system to another. Typically, file transfer is mediated by a communications protocol. In the history of computing, numerous file transfer protocols have been designed for different contexts.
Protocols.
A file transfer protocol is a convention that describes how to transfer files between two computing endpoints. As well as the stream of bits from a file stored as a single unit in a file system, some may also send relevant metadata such as the filename, file size and timestamp – and even file-system permissions and file attributes.

History of Ohio Wesleyan University

The history of Ohio Wesleyan University began with discussions of a college in Ohio in 1821 when the Ohio Methodist Conference in connection with the Kentucky Conference had established Augusta, the first Methodist institution of higher learning in the United States. But Augusta was an obscure village, quite inaccessible and especially because it was on the "wrong" side of the Ohio River to suit the growing anti-slavery sentiments of the people of Ohio.
Founders.
The part of the Olentangy River now occupied by Delaware hosted a Delaware Native American village prior to the founding of the town in 1808. The Delawares called themselves Lenape or Leni-lenape, equivalent to ""real men"," or ""native, genuine men" and were called "Grandfathers"" by the Algonquian tribes because of their belief that the Delawares were the oldest and original Algonquian nation. During the American Revolution, the Delawares became a divided people. Many attempted to remain neutral in the conflict. Some adopted Christianity, while other Delawares supported the English, who had assumed the role of the French traders at the end of the French and Indian War. These natives thanked England for the Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited colonists from settling any further west than the Appalachian Mountains, and feared that, if the Americans were victorious, the Delawares would be driven from their lands. Following the American victory in the Revolution, the Delawares struggled against whites as they moved onto the natives' territory. In 1829, the Delawares relinquished their remaining land in Ohio and moved to present-day Kansas.
The desire to establish an institution of higher learning was discussed for several years but did not assume a practical form until The White Sulphur Spring Property, a sanatorium in Delaware, Ohio, was offered for sale in the summer of 1841. The property, which covered of land with the former Mansion House and a few other buildings, was bought on November 17, 1841, by the committee of Ohio citizens for $10,000.00, and the payment was concluded in 1849.
James Cobb, an ex-army officer and a graduate of West Point, was the first informal principal of the preparatory school for both girls and boys. At the end of 1841, he retired from teaching due to his poor health conditions.
The following year, the state legislature of Ohio, under an old Ohio state constitution, granted a special charter to the new school on March 7, 1842.
On March 7, 1842, the founders formed a board of trustees and secured a charter, edited by a local resident Joseph Trimble, from the Ohio legislature. The charter established wide powers to a board comprising twenty-one members. The charter emphasized the democratic spirit of freedom of teaching.
Following the formal recognition by the state, the school appointed its first principal, Solomon Howard, and the formally recognized school unofficially opened its doors on November 1, 1842, six months later after the school obtained its official charter. The enrollment on November 1 comprised four boys. However, it increased to 130 students by the end of 1842, a number comprising students of both genders.
The school officially opened its doors on November 13, 1844, as a Methodist-related but nonsectarian college under the name Ohio Wesleyan University. It was among the first of a number of institutions named for Methodism founder John Wesley. The college originally admitted only male students, and began with twenty-nine students and three professors. The renamed Elliott Hall, formerly the Mansion House Hotel, served as an academic facility, recitation hall and a dormitory.
Conception.
The school started functioning as an institution of higher learning on November 13, 1844, when the College of Liberal Arts opened its doors. Edward Thompson headed the college. In addition to the college president, the school hired four more instructors. The first salaries of the school administrators were fixed at: $800 for the college president, $600 for college professors, and $400 for other instructors. November 13 was a rainy day and the surroundings were not pleasant. Apart from the senior class and the students in the preparatory school, the starting class was composed of male students only. The first-year class consisted of twenty-nine students. Of the twenty-nine students, at the end of 1844, two were juniors, two were sophomores, fourteen freshmen and ninety-two in the prep school.
The first graduating exercises occurred in 1846 when the school graduated one student with the degree A.B. The following year, the school graduated two students. The graduating class increased subsequently with the only interruption occurring with a two-year interruption during the Civil War when Wesleyan students participated on behalf of the Union Army.
On August 5, 1846, the first president, Edward Thomson, delivered his inaugural address. He stated that the college was a product of the liberality of the people of Delaware. He believed that Ohio Wesleyan was fortunate in that it was founded as a community divided in religious and political opinions because the friction of a mixed society prevented dogmatism, developed energy, and that the spirit of the college is the spirit of liberty.
Thomson and his successors were vocal in other political debates of the time, such as slavery and the expansion of the United States. In 1857, Edward Thomson denounced the argument that southern Christians "should retain their slaves in obedience to state laws forbidding manumission," saying that "the soft and slippered Christianity which disturbs no one, is not the Christianity of Christ."
The Ohio Wesleyan Female College was established in 1853. In 1857, the female college moved to Monnett Hall, named for school benefactress Mary Monnett Bain. In 1877, the female college merged with the university, which became coeducational. Monnett Hall remained the center for women's housing on campus well into the 20th century. The Monnett Garden, which now stands between Sanborn Hall and Austin Manor, was constructed in 1990 to honor the former Monnett Hall.
Early leadership.
Since the college was exclusively geared towards the needs of men from the very start, the Ohio Wesleyan Female College was chartered on April 1, 1853, also located in Delaware, Ohio. It graduated 411 graduated by its formal union with Ohio Wesleyan University on August 11, 1877. Since that date, the institution has been continuously and exclusively co-educational.
Early in its inception, the corporate powers of the college were vested in a board of twenty-one board members, the vast majority, seventy percent, at that time being laymen. In 1849, the number of the trustees, was increased to thirty-one.
The first president of the college after its formal charter, was Edward Thomson. He served the college until 1860 when moved to a position of a publication editor for a journal in New York City. He was succeeded by Frederick Merrick, elected in 1860 and serving until 1873 when he resigned on account of poor health. Between 1873 and 1876, Lorenzo McCabe, a senior professor at the college, administered the interim presidency until a new appointment
The third president was Charles Payne, who was elected in 1876. Under his presidency, the number of students doubled and the university assets increased to $500,000. He had a reputation for being a strict disciplinarian. Payne resigned in 1888 when he accepted the position of corresponding secretary of the Methodist Church in Ohio to which he was elected.
Campus development.
In the early years, the main central building for teaching purposes encompassed the former Mansion House. It was a Colonial style building, a former sanatorium, which was utilizing the fact that sulfur water was springing naturally from the grounds near the building. The Mansion House also served as a library, which contained several hundred books for about twelve to fifteen years since the college's conception. In 1856, a new temporary three-story brick building was built housing the expanding library collection. The brick building was eventually replaced when the Elihu Slocum Library was built in 1898. Another addition to the campus was University Hall built in 1893. By the turn of the century the campus comprised a total of thirteen buildings serving the various departments.
The female college, until its merge with the university, of consisted of a women's dormitory and a Music department, an adjoining tract containing the Arts Department, a President's House, an Observatory, the latter three buildings situated on land of about . The university had no dormitories for men only.
The aggregate number of volumes in the library in the 1880s was 12,000. Most of the library and the museum collections focus on books in botany, zoology, mineralogy and geology.
Academic degrees.
Wesleyan was granting bachelors, master's and doctoral degrees until the turn of the century. For example, in 1897, the university conferred one-hundred and six bachelor's degrees, eleven master's, thirty-three doctor of medicine and two doctor of sacred theology.
The school continued to grant A.B.s for the students interested in the Classics course until 1868, when Ohio Wesleyan University began granting S.B. degrees for students interested in the study of sciences.
Fundraising and curriculum.
The Dartmouth College case, a case that questioned the constitutionality of the institution operating as a private college, had opened a wide range of freedom for the establishment of private or denominational schools, and the charter was issued by special legislative act. Wesleyan was founded as a result of an educational renaissance in Ohio, a process described as "denomination-ridden, poverty-stricken...in fact not colleges at all, but glorified high schools or academies that presumed to offer degrees". However, in the early days the Methodist denomination constituted a minority among the school's graduates.
In the 1850s, Ohio Wesleyan was by a large majority Republican, a party at that time associated with anti-slavery and Unionism. On May 17, 1861, a huge flag was raised at a large concourse. In the annual celebrations for George Washington's birthday in 1862, a college seniors responded to the toasts for the college classes with an oration being "our Republic: May she have a second Washington in her second revolution" implicitly endorsing the ideals of democracy at stake.
During the mid-19th century, the school focused as on curriculum and fund raising. During this era, the college administration significantly increased the school's coffers, but failed to abolish fraternities. Between the years 1876 and 1888, enrollment in the college tripled and music education experienced a decided renaissance, though no major buildings were built during this time.
Campus expansion.
By the end of the 19th century, the university grew to contain several schools: a College of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844), a School of Music (1877), a School of Fine Arts (1877), a School of Oratory (1894), and a Business School (1895). Recognizing the need for new departments and the value of specialized instruction, the Ohio Wesleyan administration improved the college's facilities and offerings to make its curriculum and buildings on par with its new academic position. Construction during that period included Monnett extensions, University Hall and Slocum Library. Athletics and physical education facilities were established and a start was made for a new gymnasium.
During these years OWU added departments for natural science (physics, zoology, geology), speech, history, French, English and economics. The new ideal of specialization brought an emphasis on professional preparation for the Doctor of Philosophy degree and on travel and study in Europe. Three professional schools—Law, of Medicine and Theology—were formed and the Doric Front was demolished.
The specialization of the curriculum, a process that started during the Bashford presidency, influenced a lot of undergraduate students to take on further graduate study at other universities. Two Rhodes Scholars from Ohio Wesleyan were appointed during the first ten years of the 1910s: E.R.Loyd (1905) and E.E. Lincoln (1909). In 1907, the United Societes of Phi Beta Kappa, the oldest undergraduate honors organization in the United States installed its first chapter on campus.
It was decided during the Welch presidency years that despite the expansion and the institution's name, Ohio Wesleyan University was to remain a college, not a university. In the interest of wider degree legitimacy, the Bachelor of Science degree was dropped and only the Bachelor of Arts was offered. The mantle of the old classical degree would be used to invoke a wide variety of fields, not just classical studies. Academic requirements for the bachelor's degree were cut and the emphasis on Latin and mathematics came to an end during the 1920s.
During the Hoffman years, the academy and the school of business came to an end in 1916. The academy had started in 1842 as a preparatory school and throughout its seventy-five years of existence frequently outnumbered the college in enrollment. The academy's demise was precipitated by the expansion of enrollment in public high schools and the Ohio centralized school system that started during the years of the Welch presidency. Decreasing demand for college preparatory services coincided with more stringent Department of Education conditions.
Depression years.
During the 1920s the chapel service was dropped and sororities came into being. Edgar Hall came into use and Selby Stadium was built. Austin Manor and Perkins Observatory was constructed and Stuyvesant Hall was planned.
The 1930s were marked by the effects of the Great Depression years. Even before 1929 there had been a shrinkage of enrollment, alumni donations decreased, and faculty size remained the same resulting in the Soper (1928–1938) and Burgstahler's (1939–1947) administration battling mainly financial problems of survival. During the early 1930s the university administration undertook curriculum adjustments. Greek and Latin seemed to decline in popularity, business administration and economics continued to remain attractive, with the social sciences, English, pre-medicine and history among the largest enrollments at the school. The registrar in these years stated that these years saw a student "increase from eastern states and from Ohio cities, the number of foreign students and the fact that about seven hundred of our students contemplated some form of further educational work". By the 1930s, the number of Methodist students had appreciably declined to a minority among the student body.
Today.
The Conrades-Wetherell Science Center opened in 2004 to provide of additional space for the science departments. An athletic fundraising campaign began in 2005.
Between 1996 and 2001 fiscal years, Ohio Wesleyan increased its expenditures per student by 23%, while the average increase over the same period for top tier liberal arts colleges was 17%. Economist Robert Lenke argued that this increase in spending per student contributed to an increase in the school's PhD creation rate, a rate that captures the number of students that obtained baccalaureates at Ohio Wesleyan and eventually earned a doctorate at another institution. During the same time period, the PhD creation rate for Ohio Wesleyan graduates increased from 3.8 to 5.3. Biological science and Social science graduates of the college receive doctorates at disproportionately higher rates than graduates in other academic fields.
Both academic and athletic achievements have marked Ohio Wesleyan's recent history. In mathematics, OWU's team has finished first five out of the last ten years at the Ohio Five mathematics contest. In the athletics world, the Battling Bishops have captured four NCAA Division III national championships in soccer and basketball in the last two decades.
Today, OWU maintains a loose, mainly historic, affiliation with the United Methodist Church.

Sybirak

A sybirak (, plural: "sybiracy") is a person resettled to Siberia. Like its Russian counterpart "sibiryák", the word can refer to any dweller of Siberia, but it more specifically refers to Poles imprisoned or exiled to Siberia
or even to those sent to the Russian Arctic or to Kazakhstan in the 1940s (post World War II).
History.
Russian and Soviet authorities exiled many Poles to Siberia, starting with the 18th-century opponents of the Russian Empire's increasing influence in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (most notably the members of the Bar Confederation of 1768–1772). Maurice, Count de Benyovszky was deported and emigrated to Madagascar.
After the Russian Empire's penal law changed in 1847, exile and penal labor ("katorga") became common punishment for participants in national uprisings within the empire. This led to sending an increasing number of Poles to Siberia for "katorga", when they then became known as "Sybiraks". Some of them remained there, forming a Polish minority in Siberia. Most of them came from the participants and supporters of the November Uprising of 1830-1831 and of the January Uprising of 1863–1864, from the participants of the 1905-1907 unrest and from the hundreds of thousands of people deported after the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939.
Around the late 19th century, a number of Polish voluntary settlers moved to Siberia, attracted by the economic development of the region. Polish migrants and exiles, many of whom were forbidden to move away from the region even after having finished serving their sentence, formed a Polish minority there. Hundreds of Poles took part in the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway. Notable Polish scholars studied Siberia, such as Aleksander Czekanowski, Jan Czerski, Benedykt Dybowski, Wiktor Godlewski, Sergiusz Jastrzębski, Edward Piekarski (1858-1934), Bronisław Piłsudski, Wacław Sieroszewski, Mikołaj Witkowski and others.
The term "Sybiracy" might also refer to former exiles, such as those who were allowed to return to Russian controlled parts of Poland following the amnesty of 1857 . The group, popular among the youth in the period preceding the outbreak of the January Uprising, supported the idea of organic work. However, during the January Uprising it ceased to exist as some of its members supported the Reds, while others supported the Whites. Among the most notable members of the group were Agaton Giller, Henryk Krajewski, Karol Ruprecht and Szymon Tokarzewski.
About 20,000 Poles lived in Siberia around the 1860s. An unsuccessful uprising of Polish political exiles in Siberia broke out in 1866.
Soviet era.
At the start of World War II the Soviets deported hundreds of thousands of Polish citizens, most of them in four mass waves. Some sources claim as many as 1.5 million deportees. The most conservative figures use recently found NKVD documents showing 309,000 to 381,220.
Soviet authorities did not recognize ethnic Poles as Polish citizens. In addition, some of the figures are based on those given an amnesty rather than those deported, and not everyone was eligible for amnesty. Therefore, figures based on official evidence might be an underestimation.

Battle of Peonnum

The Battle of Peonnum was fought about AD 660 between the West Saxons under Cenwalh and the Britons of what is now Somerset in England. It was a decisive victory for the Saxons, who gained control of Somerset as far west as the River Parrett. The location of the battle is uncertain.
Saxon conquest.
The border between the West Saxons and the Britons of Somerset had been set at the Wansdyke along the ridge of the Mendip Hills following the Battle of Deorham and the Saxon occupation of Bath in 577. Then, in 652, Cenwalh broke through at the Battle of Bradford on Avon.
Relief for the Britons came when Cenwalh was exiled to East Anglia after a squabble with Penda of Mercia. Some time after his return he renewed the attack on the British tribes and in 658 his army met the Britons for a climactic battle at Peonnum. The Saxons were victorious, and Cenwalh advanced west through the Polden Hills to the River Parrett, annexing eastern and central Somerset. The territory gained was modest in size; Geoffrey Ashe suggests that Cenwalh's ultimate goal may have been gaining control over the valuable Glastonbury Abbey within it.
The border remained at the Parrett until 681–685, when Centwine of Wessex defeated King Cadwaladr of Gwynedd and his local allies, allowing them to occupy the rest of Somerset west and north to the Bristol Channel. West Saxon rule was consolidated and extended into Devon by King Ina.
Location.
The battle is said to have happened "æt peonnum", which means "at the "penns"". "Penn" is the Brittonic Celtic word for "head" or "top", widely used for "hill" or "peak". An element 'Pen' in modern place-names in this area is found in Penselwood ("Pen Selwood"), near Wincanton which is called "Penna" in the Domesday Book, Pinhoe or Pen Beacon in Devon, and Penn (near Yeovil). One of the highest points of the Mendip Hills is named Pen Hill.

A male passenger, subsequently identified as Miloslav Hrabinec, a Czech migrant, had boarded the flight in Adelaide with a concealed sawn-off .22 ArmaLite rifle and a sheath knife strapped to his leg. About a half-hour before the scheduled landing time, as the flight was making its descent into Alice Springs Airport, he emerged from the lavatory, produced the gun, and said to a flight attendant named Gai Rennie, "This is a hijack". 
Gai walked through the cabin followed by the hijacker. She then explained to flight attendant Kaye Goreham that the man behind her had a gun. All three then moved to the front of the aircraft. Gai then advised Captain Young and First Officer Walter Gowans that a man wanted to talk and he had a gun and said it was a hijack. However, the Captain said he was in landing mode &amp; would talk to him on the ground. The Captain asked Gai, 'What does he want'. Gai replied that she didn't know. The crew informed Hrabinec that he needed to be seated for landing and he complied.
Negotiations with police.
After the plane landed, police commenced negotiations with the hijacker. According to Goreham's account, Hrabinec stated his motive was not financial (he asked for no money) but that he wanted to commit suicide in a spectacular way by parachuting into a remote location and surviving for as long as he could before killing himself. To this end, he demanded a light aircraft, a parachute, and a jumpsuit.
Attempt to escape in a light aircraft.
A civilian pilot and flying instructor, the local Aero Club manager Ossie Watts, volunteered himself and his Cessna aircraft. An undercover police constable Paul Sandeman, posing as Watts' navigator, was also on board the Cessna. According to Kaye Goreham, Hrabinec became suspicious upon seeing Sandeman and requested Goreham search Sandeman for weapons. Goreham did so but did not inform the hijacker when she felt a small firearm Sandeman had hidden. Goreham states that the policeman "went for his gun" and the hijacker shot Sandeman in the hand and stomach. Sandeman was also shot in the right shoulder and left arm. The hijacker ran off and Watts, who had been shown how to use a gun minutes earlier, began shooting. Police marksmen also opened fire and Hrabinec was wounded. Hrabinec then retreated to a ditch where he fatally shot himself. 
Outcome.
Constable Sandeman was awarded the Queen's Commendation for Bravery.
Hrabinec was not identified as the hijacker until May 1973.

Lax equivalence theorem

In numerical analysis, the Lax equivalence theorem is a fundamental theorem in the analysis of linear finite difference methods for the numerical solution of linear partial differential equations. It states that for a linear consistent finite difference method for a well-posed linear initial value problem, the method is convergent if and only if it is stable.
The importance of the theorem is that while the convergence of the solution of the linear finite difference method to the solution of the linear partial differential equation is what is desired, it is ordinarily difficult to establish because the numerical method is defined by a recurrence relation while the differential equation involves a differentiable function. However, consistency—the requirement that the linear finite difference method approximates the correct linear partial differential equation—is straightforward to verify, and stability is typically much easier to show than convergence (and would be needed in any event to show that round-off error will not destroy the computation). Hence convergence is usually shown via the Lax equivalence theorem.
Stability in this context means that a matrix norm of the matrix used in the iteration is at most unity, called (practical) Lax–Richtmyer stability. Often a von Neumann stability analysis is substituted for convenience, although von Neumann stability only implies Lax–Richtmyer stability in certain cases.
This theorem is due to Peter Lax. It is sometimes called the Lax–Richtmyer theorem, after Peter Lax and Robert D. Richtmyer.

Isabella Toscano

Isabella Toscano is a fictional character from the NBC soap opera "Days of Our Lives". The character first appeared on a recurring basis on October 16, 1989, and was portrayed by actress Staci Greason. Greason was put on contract in December 1989. Greason left the show in October 1992, after Isabella died from pancreatic cancer. Greason reappeared later on as Isabella's ghost in 1995, 2000, 2002, 2003, and most recently in November 2010.
Storylines.
Isabella was born on July 27, 1960, to Loretta Toscano and Ernesto Toscano. She had an older sister, Marina Theresa Toscano. In 1989, Isabella was introduced as an inmate at an asylum. Isabella's sister, Marina (Hunter Tylo) was keeping her locked up against her will. She escaped with the help of Jack Deveraux and she hid in his loft. Together, Jack and Isabella discovered the Toscano family treasure and her mother, Loretta's diary—which Marina had been looking for.
When Marina's dead body was discovered, Steve's wife, Kayla Brady was convicted in her murder. Unwilling to believe Kayla was guilty, Isabella teamed up with Kayla's brother, Roman Brady. In a surprising turn of events, Isabella and Roman discovered Isabella killed Marina, then blocked the deed from her memory. With this new evidence, Kayla was released and Isabella cleared on the grounds of self-defense.
In the summer of 1990, Isabella became a key figure in the infamous Cruise of Deception storyline when Ernesto Toscano, also seeking his late wife Loretta's diary, invited Salem's most prominent members aboard his yacht. Jack returned some of the diary's pages he had stole. Isabella discovered her biological father was not Ernesto but Victor Kiriakis. A furious Ernesto then kidnapped Isabella, taking her to a nearby island. Just before Ernesto succeeded in poisoning Isabella as he had her mother after he discovered Loretta's affair with Victor, Roman rescued Isabella. In the mayhem, Ernesto and Hope Brady were killed.
Returning to Salem, Isabella began a private investigation agency with her new-found brother, Bo Brady, and her relationship with Roman deepened. The couple become engaged and made plans to move in together when Roman's presumed-dead wife, Marlena, returned to Salem. A devastated Isabella assured Roman she would not stand in the way of rebuilding his marriage with Marlena. However, she began to truly despair when she discovered she was pregnant with Roman's baby.
Things came to a head when Roman and Marlena were confronted by a man claiming to be the "real" Roman Brady. Roman's mother, Caroline Brady, confirmed the latter's claim. Salemites were stunned to learn the man that they called Roman for six years was an impostor. Devastated, the false Roman reverted to using his old name, John Black, and began a desperate search into his real identity. He also reunited with Isabella after she told him she was having their child. On May 19, 1992, during the couple's marriage ceremony, Isabella went into labor; she quickly gave birth to Brady Victor Black and named him in honor of the Brady family and Isabella's father.
The Black family's happiness was short-lived when Dr. Carly Manning informed Isabella her back pain was the result of advanced pancreatic cancer. Telling John she wanted to die in her "real" home, John and Isabella went to Venice where she quietly died in John's arms on October 16, 1992.
Isabella's afterlife.
In 1993, Marlena and Roman Brady named their newborn daughter Isabella, nicknamed Belle for short. In a not-unusual daytime plot twist, Marlena discovered that John was the father of Belle, not Roman. Isabella's ghost made several guest appearances: in 1995, as part of Satan's plot, and in 2000, while attempting to save Eric Brady. Later that year, Isabella appeared to John as her former husband prayed for guidance, unsure as how he could best help their angry, now college-age son, Brady. In 2002 and 2003, a ghostly Isabella again appeared to a now calmer Brady, who was struggling with his feelings for Chloe Lane. She also appeared to Brady on several occasions in 2010 while Brady had Vivian Alamain buried alive inside a sarcophagus.
On Mother's Day in 2019, her son Brady and Kristen DiMera welcomed their daughter Rachel Isabella DiMera Black, who was named after her and Kristen's mother: Rachel Blake, who was switched at birth by Xander Kiriakis, under orders by her great- grandfather Victor to spare his wife Maggie Horton the truth that she's responsible for the deaths of Adrienne Johnson and her granddaughter: the real Mackenzie Horton. Rachel later had developed cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant from Gabi Hernandez.
In order to remember their daughter, a technique taught to Brady by his step-mother Marlena Evans, Kristen remembers that Rachel has a heart shaped birthmark on her neck.
Later, Brady's ex-girlfriend Nicole Walker discovered the truth about the baby switch by overhearing the conversation between Dr. Amanda Raynor and Xander, later between Xander and Victor, then sets up a fight between herself and Kristen to get a DNA sample, which is tampered by Xander by paying the lab technician, because Nicole is on to him. Later, after her talk with Abe Carver, Nicole is planning to find Dr. Raynor to get the truth about the baby switch between Rachel and Mackenzie in order to tell Eric Brady and Sarah the truth about their baby and to reunite Rachel with her parents. While in the hospital with Rachel, Brady noticed that the baby has a heart-shaped birthmark on her neck and confide with his father John about his suspicions about Rachel and Mackenzie. Later, Nicole got confirmation from Raynor, she is prepare to tell Eric the truth about Rachel and Mackenzie. After finding out his daughter is alive, Brady realizes that his grandfather Victor and his cousin Xander were behind the baby switch that cause Sarah Horton to kidnap Rachel and flee to her cousin Abigail and Chad's apartment in Paris. After learning that Kristen stabbed Victor, Brady took the blame in order to protect her and went to jail. Kristen later tells Lani the truth about Victor's stabbing. Later, Kristen receive a phone call from Rex Brady (Kyle Lowder) and with the help of her nephew and Lani's brother Theo Carver (Kyler Pettis), she learns that Rachel and Sarah are in Paris by tracking Rex's phone. After Kristen finds Sarah and Rachel at the train station, she confronts Sarah over taking Rachel, then after her heartbreaking plea, she convinces Sarah to give her baby back, she is then reunited with Rachel after Sarah hands her over. Kristen and Rachel is later reunited with Brady, but Kristen tells Brady that she can't go back to Salem, because of her warrant for stabbing Victor. Then, Brady tells her to take Rachel and go on the run, she leaves the train station with Rachel after a heartfelt goodbye with Brady. After Brady returns to Salem without Kristen and Rachel, he tells Eric and Nicole that he let Kristen and Rachel go on a run, and Eric gets angry over the situation, But Nicole understands the situation. Then, Brady meets Sarah at the Salem Pub after she learns that Kristen is on the run with Rachel and they have decided to plotted to get revenge on Victor and Xander for that they did to them and their children.

Wildsurf

"Wildsurf" is a song by Ash, released as the second single from the album "Nu-Clear Sounds" in 1998. It reached 31 in the UK Singles Chart, while doing less prominently in BBC Radio 1, where it was placed in the "C" list. The single was released in CD, 7" vinyl, and cassette.
"Wildsurf" has been described by many of having a "summery" feel to it. Tim once said of it: "I was reading Jack Kerouac's 'On The Road' while we were on the road and it really inspired this song. It's about living life, burning like roman candles across the night." The song was written drawing inspiration from the styles of Nirvana and The Beach Boys.
An extended version of the song was featured in the CD2 release. She one contains an additional guitar solo by Hatherley. The song can also be found on the "Intergalactic Sonic 7″s" hits collection, as well as on the "Tokyo Blitz" DVD. The track was remixed by Butch Vig for release in America. This is the only song from Nu-Clear Sounds selected for Ash's album released in 2011 "The Best of Ash".
B-sides.
"Stormy Waters" (CD1) was the first song fully written by drummer Rick McMurray. It appears on the "Cosmic Debris" B-sides collection. McMurray wrote it for his girlfriend after their first argument.
The second CD1 B-side, "When I'm Tired" is another of the "Nu-Clear Sounds" era bittersweet 'burn-out' songs, although with a slightly faster pace than some of its contemporaries.
The CD2 track, "Lose Control" is a cover of a Peak &amp; Backwater song. It was performed regularly on the accompanying "Nu-Clear Sounds" tour. It can also be found on the "Cosmic Debris" collection.
Lastly, "Gonna Do It Soon" is the second song written by Charlotte Hatherley. It was originally a Nightnurse song (Hatherley's former band), but she re-worked the lyrics for the song to appear as a new Ash B-side.
Music video.
The video was directed by Howard Greenhalgh. Ash said of the video: "Howard took us to the Natural History Museum in London. There we shot performance against giant video screens and metallic globes. We also headed to East London for more performance shots in the Docklands area. The video follows a sci-fi looking chick obsessed with water. She has some kinda weird aqua car and then ends up surfing a tsunami which destroys the city. The final special effect shot is so tacky and crap it's laughable!"

Susan Engeleiter

Susan Shannon Engeleiter (née Susan Jane Shannon; born March 18, 1952) is an American Republican politician, lawyer, and businesswoman who served as the first female Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration. She previously served nine years in the Wisconsin Senate and four years in the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing Waukesha County.
Early life and education.
Engeleiter was born in Brookfield, Wisconsin to Helen "Jo" Hildebrandt Shannon and Arthur W. Shannon, a Republican fundraiser and later the treasurer of the Republican Party of Wisconsin. She graduated from Brookfield Central High School in 1970. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1974 and received a juris doctor from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1981. In 1976, she married Gerald Engeleiter. The couple later divorced.
Political career.
Engeleiter was elected to the 99th district of Wisconsin Assembly in 1974. At age 22, she was the youngest woman ever elected to the Wisconsin Legislature. She served in the Assembly until January 1979, having decided against running for re-election in 1978 and instead, sought the congressional seat being vacated by Bob Kasten, who decided to run for Wisconsin governor. Engeleiter lost the primary to then-State Senator Jim Sensenbrenner by 589 votes. In April 1980, Engeleiter was elected in a special election to the Wisconsin State Senate. There she served as Assistant Minority Leader from 1982 to 1984, and as Minority Leader from 1984 to 1989. She was the first woman to serve as Minority Leader.

Skyview on the Ridge

Skyview on the Ridge is a future redevelopment of a shopping mall located in Irondequoit, New York, a suburb of Rochester. The mall opened in 1990 as Irondequoit Mall, featuring anchors McCurdy's, Sibley's, J. C. Penney, and Sears.
On January 22, 2016, Angelo Ingrassia, a local real estate developer who specializes in developing premier properties, purchased the center.
On August 29, 2017, Angelo Ingrassia announced a plan to construct an office park along with retail, a community center, as well as a large residential component. The development is named Skyview on the Ridge.
On July 30, 2019, the Town of Irondequoit approved a referendum that would allow the town to move forward by borrowing $7.25 million to build a community center.
History.
Wilmorite Properties first announced plans for Irondequoit Mall in June 1985, and by May 1988, the first three anchor stores were confirmed: Sears, J. C. Penney, and Sibley's, which became Kaufmann's soon after opening. It opened in March 1990 with approximately 110 stores, and had an estimated 80,000 customers in its first weekend of business. McCurdy's opened as a fourth anchor store in 1992, which later became regional division The Bon-Ton. The mall was an early success and remained moderately popular until it was shuttered.
Target opened on an outparcel in 2007.
Congel era.
In 2007, the center was purchased by Scott R. Congel, a former principal with The Pyramid Companies of Syracuse. The sale triggered speculation that the surrounding property may be further developed. Congel announced a large 421-room hotel, 330 condominium units and a 16-screen movie theater would be part of the project, along with retail, restaurant and office space and an underground parking garage.
The recession hit financing before any work began. With the exception of Sears and Macy's anchoring either end of the mall, the mall shuttered in February 2009 for further development.

La Chunga

Micaela Flores Amaya (1938 – 3 January 2025), better known by the stage name La Chunga, was a Spanish flamenco dancer, and painter of naïf art.
Early life.
Micaela Flores Amaya was born in Marseille, France, in 1938, although the exact date of her birth remains unknown. Her parents were Andalusian Romanis, who emigrated to France during the Spanish Civil War. When she was less than a year old, her family moved to Barcelona. Additionally, she was the sister of flamenco dancer Lorenza "La Chunguita" Flores Amaya, and cousin of famed flamenco dancer Carmen Amaya.
La Chunga started dancing when she was six years-old in the "Ca La Rosita", a well-known bodega for the Romanì community in El Poble-Sec. It was at this time she was discovered by painter Francisco "Paco" Rebés, during one of her improvised street performances. Rebés would later take her under his tutelage, and assume the role of her godfather.
Career.
La Chunga became the 'muse' of several writers, including Blas de Otero, Rafael Alberti, José Manuel Caballero Bonald, and León Felipe, as well as several painters, including Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, and the aforementioned Francisco Rebés, who made her an attractive character for intellectuals and encouraged her to paint. A 1958 photo shows Salvador Dalí inviting her to make art by dancing on a blank canvas. During intervals, Dali would paint beneath her feet. She was known for her barefoot style of flamenco dance and described as "The Barefoot Dancer". She was admired by Picasso as a "shining naif". She also exhibited in several galleries in Paris and Madrid. After then, Chunga participated in many tours and some films.
Personal life and death.
La Chunga married director José Luis Gonzalvo, and they had a daughter, Pilar.
La Chunga died on 3 January 2025, at the age of 87.

Charley Harper

Charley Harper (August 4, 1922June 10, 2007) was a Cincinnati-based American Modernist artist. He was best known for his highly stylized wildlife prints, posters, and book illustrations. 
Born Charles Burton Harper in Frenchton, West Virginia, in 1922, Harper's upbringing on his family farm influenced his work to his last days. He left his farm home to study art at the Art Academy of Cincinnati, and won the academy's first Stephen H. Wilder Traveling Scholarship. Also during his time at the Academy, and supposedly on the first day, Charley met fellow artist Edie Mckee, whom he married shortly after graduation in 1947.
Charley and Edie spent their honeymoon traveling the country, mainly in the west and south, being able to do so because of the Stephen H. Wilder Scholarship the Academy awarded to Charley for post-graduate travels. Charley Harper returned to the Art Academy of Cincinnati as a teacher and also worked for a commercial firm before working on his own. He and his wife worked out of their Roselawn and Finneytown homes, and later, with their only child Brett Harper, formed Harper Studios.
During his career, Charley Harper illustrated numerous books, notably "The Golden Book of Biology", magazines such as " Ford Times", as well as many prints, posters, and other works. As his subjects are mainly natural, with birds prominently featured, Charley often created works for many nature-based organizations, among them the National Park Service, Cincinnati Zoo, Cincinnati Nature Center, Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Hamilton County (Ohio) Park District, and Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania. He also designed interpretive displays for Everglades National Park.
Charley Harper died in Cincinnati on Sunday, June 10, 2007, at age 84 after contending with pneumonia for some months.
Style.
In a style he called "minimal realism", Charley Harper captured the essence of his subjects with the fewest possible visual elements. When asked to describe his unique visual style, Charley responded: 
When I look at a wildlife or nature subject, I don't see the feathers in the wings, I just count the wings. I see exciting shapes, color combinations, patterns, textures, fascinating behavior, and endless possibilities for making interesting pictures. I regard the picture as an ecosystem in which all the elements are interrelated, interdependent, perfectly balanced, without trimming or unutilized parts; and herein lies the lure of painting; in a world of chaos, the picture is one small rectangle in which the artist can create an ordered universe.
 
He contrasted his nature-oriented artwork with the realism of John James Audubon, drawing influence from Cubism, Minimalism, Einsteinian physics and countless other developments in Modern art and science. His style distilled and simplified complex organisms and natural subjects, yet they are often arranged in a complex fashion. On the subject of his simplified forms, Harper noted:
I don't think there was much resistance to the way I simplified things. I think everybody understood that. Some people liked it and others didn't care for it. There's some who want to count all the feathers in the wings and then others who never think about counting the feathers, like me.
The results are bold, colorful, and often whimsical. The designer Todd Oldham wrote of Harper, "Charley's inspired yet the accurate color sense is undeniable, and when combined with the precision he exacts on rendering only the most important details, one is always left with a sense of awe."
Charley, on numerous examples, also went outside the medium of graphic art and included short prose poems for the artwork he made.
Examples of Harper's style may be seen in the example above, as well as the following United States National Park Service posters:
In 2002 his artwork was selected for the International Migratory Bird Day conservation theme- Exploring Habitats.

Foundation Stone

The Foundation Stone (), or the Noble Rock () is the rock at the center of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. It is also known as the Pierced Stone, because it has a small hole on the southeastern corner that enters a cavern beneath the rock, known as the Well of Souls.
Traditional Jewish sources mention the stone as the place from which the creation of the world began. Classical Jewish sources also identify its location with that of the Holy of Holies.
Location.
The rock is located towards the centre of the Temple Mount, at the top of Jerusalem's Old City southern hill. The current shape is the result of an expansion by Herod the Great on top of vaults over a summit called Mount Moriah which three millennia ago was the highest elevation in early Jerusalem's proximity to the City of David.
Early Muslim writings argue that the Dome of the Rock, completed in 691, is the site of the Holy of Holies and therefore the location of the Foundation Stone. The history by the 9th-century writer al-Tabari has Kaʿb al-Aḥbār, a Jewish convert to Islam, asking the caliph Umar to build a mosque over the rock, to which Umar responds, "O Ka'b, you are imitating the Jewish religion!" Al-Tabari then identifies the rock with the place where the Romans had "buried the temple () at the time of the sons of Israel." "Pirqe de-Rabbi Eliezer" (9th century) also wrote: "Rabbi Ishmael said: In the future, the sons of Ishmael (the Arabs) will do fifteen things in the Land of Israel[...] They will fence in the breaches of the walls of the Temple and construct a building on the site of the sanctuary."
Jewish sources have debated the precise location of the rock. Benjamin of Tudela wrote () that the site was in front of the Dome, on the site of the Western Wall. The "Travels of Petachia of Ratisbon", , and "Travels of a Student of the Ramban" () state that "on the Temple Mount stands a beautiful sanctuary which an Arab king built long ago, over the place of the Temple sanctuary and courtyard." Obadiah Bartenura says in a 1488 letter from Jerusalem that "I sought the Foundation Stone [which marks] the former place of the Ark of the Covenant, and many told me that it is beneath a tall and beautiful dome which the Arabs built in the Temple, but the space beneath this dome is secured, such that no man may come to it, viz. to the place of the Foundation Stone, for the dome is very large." David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra was convinced () that "under the dome [on the Temple Mount] – there is the Foundation Stone, undoubtedly – which the Arabs call ".
Other sources, operating under the belief that the Southern Wall of the Temple Mount as it stood in their time was the Southern Wall of the Biblical era, argued that the measurements given in the Talmud do not reconcile. The Holy of Holies ends up being too far north and they therefore locate the Foundation Stone as being directly opposite the current exposed section of the Western Wall, where no building currently stands. This is the view of Isaac Luria and the Maharsha, who state the prophecy that "Zion will become a ploughed field" indicates that no dwelling will be established there until the time of the Redemption. It therefore follows that the footprint of the Temple courtyard and Holy of Holies is situated in the unbuilt area between the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque.
Some believe the position is north of the Dome of the Rock, opposite the Gate of Mercy, which Immanuel Hai Ricchi identifies as the Shushan Gate mentioned in the Talmud. This gate was described as being opposite the opening of the sanctuary.
Modern Jewish academics list four possible locations of the Foundation Stone:
Description.
Although the rock is part of the surrounding 90million-year-old, Upper Turonian Stage, Late Cretaceous karsted limestone, the southern side forms a ledge, with a gap between it and the surrounding ground; a set of steps currently uses this gap to provide access from the Dome of the Rock to the Well of Souls beneath it.
Archaeologist Leen Ritmeyer reported that there are sections of the rock cut completely flat, which north-to-south have a width of 6 cubits, precisely the width that the Mishnah credits to the wall of the Holy of Holies. According to Ritmeyer, a rectangular rock-cutting he discovered on the Foundation Stone marks the location where the Ark of the Covenant stood within the Holy of Holies. Ritmeier's analysis was welcomed among biblical archeologists; however, scholars stated that this theory cannot be actually verified.
The rock has several artificial cuts in its surface generally attributed to the Crusaders, whose frequent damage to the rock was so severe that the Christian kings of Jerusalem placed a protective marble slab over the rock. The marble slab was removed after Jerusalem had been taken over by Saladin in 1187.
Measuring the flat surface as the position of the southern wall of a square enclosure, the west and north sides of which are formed by the low clean-cut "scarp" at these edges of the rock, at the position of the hypothetical centre is a rectangular cut in the rock that is about 2.5 cubits (min. 120.4 cm SI) long and 1.5 cubits (min. 72.24 cm SI) wide, which are the dimensions of the Ark of the Covenant (according to the Book of Exodus).
The Mishnah gives the height of the rock as three thumb-breadths (min. 6 cm SI) above the ground. Radbaz discusses the apparent contradiction of the Mishnah's measurements and the actual measurement of the rock within the Dome he estimates as a "height of two men" above the ground. He concluded that many changes in the natural configuration of the Temple Mount have taken place which can be attributed to excavations made by the various occupiers of Jerusalem since the Second Temple construction.
Jewish significance.
The Mishnah in tractate Yoma mentions a stone situated in the Holy of Holies that was called and had been revealed by the early prophets (i.e. David and Samuel).
An early Christian source noting Jewish attachment to the rock may be found in the , written between 333 and 334 CE when Jerusalem was under Roman rule, which describes a "perforated stone to which the Jews come every year and anoint it, bewail themselves with groans, rend their garments, and so depart."
According to the sages of the Talmud, it was from this rock that the world was created, itself being the first part of the Earth to come into existence. According to the Talmud, it was close to the Foundation Stone, on the site of the altar, that God gathered the earth that was formed into Adam. It was on this rock that Adam—and later Cain and Abel and Noah—offered sacrifices to God. Jewish sources identify this rock as the place of the Binding of Isaac mentioned in the Bible, where Abraham fulfilled God's test to see if he would be willing to sacrifice his son. The mountain is identified as Moriah in Genesis 22. It is also identified as the rock upon which Jacob dreamt about angels ascending and descending on a ladder and consequently consecrating and offering a sacrifice upon.
The Roman-era midrash sums up the centrality of and holiness of the site in Judaism:
When, according to the Bible, King David purchased a threshing floor owned by Araunah the Jebusite, it is believed that it was upon this rock that he offered the sacrifice mentioned in the verse. He wanted to construct a permanent temple there, but as his hands were "bloodied", he was forbidden to do so himself. The task was left to his son Solomon, who completed the Temple in .
"Toledot Yeshu" reports that "It was called "Shetiyya" because God placed it there (שת אותה יה; cf. "Zohar", Vayechi 43), and this is the stone which Jacob libated with wine. On it were written the letters of the Explicit Name, and anyone who knew them could perform magic to his heart's desire. The Sages feared lest youths obtain the Name and destroy the world, so they set two iron hounds at the gate, which would bark at any comer to cause him to forget what he had learned. But Jesus wrote the Name on parchment, cut open his thigh, and hid it beneath his skin. The dogs barked at him and caused him to forget the Name, but later he retrieved the parchment from his thigh and relearned it." In the words of the , "The world was not created until God took a stone called and threw it into the depths where it was fixed from above till below, and from it the world expanded. It is the centre point of the world and on this spot stood the Holy of Holies."
Role in the Temple.
Situated inside the Holy of Holies, the Foundation Stone is believed to have been the rock upon which the Ark of the Covenant was placed in Solomon's Temple. During the Second Temple period when the Ark of the Covenant was not present, the stone was used by the High Priest who offered up the incense and sprinkled the blood of the sacrifices on it during the annual Yom Kippur service.
Commemoration in Jewish law.
The Jerusalem Talmud states:
Citing this, the rules that not only are women not to prepare or attach warp threads to a weaving loom, but it is forbidden for anyone to make, buy or wear new clothes or shoes from the beginning of the week in which Tisha B'Av falls until after the fast, and that people should ideally not do so from the beginning of Av. This period is known as The Nine Days.
In further commemoration of the Foundation Stone, it is also forbidden to eat meat or drink wine from the beginning of the week in which Tisha B'av falls until after the fast. Some have the custom to refrain from these foodstuffs from Rosh Chodesh Av, while others do so from the Seventeenth of Tammuz.
Liturgical references.
In the days when Selichot are recited, in the days leading up to Rosh Hashanah until Yom Kippur, the supplications include the following references:
During Sukkot, the following references to the Foundation Stone are mentioned in the Hoshanot recital:
Islamic significance.
The Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, is thought by commentators of the Quran to be the place from where Muslims believe Muhammad began his Night Journey. Although the Quran does not specifically mention Jerusalem in name as the ascension site, labelling the site as the "farthest mosque" (from which the later-built Al-Aqsa was named), in certain Hadith it is said that the Al-Aqsa Mosque is in Jerusalem.
Tawfiq Canaan, in 1922, recorded a local tradition that describes four living waters flowing from under the rock. To the south: Hammam esh-Shifa, to the east: Siloam, to the north: 'En Haddji and En Qashleh, and to the west: Hammam es-Sultan.
Beneath the Foundation Stone is a cavern known as the Well of Souls. It is sometimes thought of as the traditional hiding place of the Ark of the Covenant.

Paradise of the Blind

Paradise of the Blind (Những thiên đường mù) is a novel by writer Dương Thu Hương, published in 1988. It was the first Vietnamese novel published in English in the United States. It is now banned in Vietnam because of the political views it expounds.
Plot.
Source:
"Paradise of the Blind" follows a non-linear, vertical plot depicting the development of Hang, the narrator, through several life-changing events. An adult Hang in the 1980s receives a telegram stating that her uncle, Chinh, is ill and that she must visit him in Moscow. Throughout her journey to Moscow she recounts significant events in her childhood.
As she looks back on the past, she realizes it is the steadfast resolve toward familial duty that has made her family so miserable. She realizes this does not have to be her fate. While she is waiting to leave Russia for Vietnam, she sees a group of young Japanese students who are happy and laughing and free. She longs to be Japanese, of a race that does not carry the same burdens as her people. She resolves to do what it is that makes her happy—because her duty to her mother, who would sacrifice her own daughter to help her corrupt brother—is not happiness.

Raosaheb Danve

Raosaheb Dadarao Danve (born on 18 March 1955) is an Indian politician and former Member of Parliament from Jalna, Minister of State in the Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Coal and Ministry of Mines in Second Modi ministry. He is a member of Bharatiya Janata Party and was elected to Lok Sabha from Jalna constituency for five straight terms beginning in 1999 until 2024. He previously served as Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution from 30 May 2019 to 7 July 2021 and also served as the Maharashtra state President of BJP.
Personal life.
Danve was born to Kesharabai and Dadarao on 18 March 1956. Danve married Nirmala Tai in 1977. They have 3 daughters and a son, Santosh Danve, who is a Bhartiya Janata Party MLA from Bhokardan Legislative Constituency.
Political career.
Danve has held leadership positions at all levels of politics in India beginning since 1976. He is known as a leader with rural roots. Danve began his political career as a Sarpanch in 1978, becoming an MLA in 1990 &amp; in 1995 from Bhokardan assembly constituency, and 5 time consecutive Member of parliament since 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019. 
During the general elections that were held in May 2014, Danve won the Jalna constituency for the fourth time. Immediately afterwards, he was sworn in by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the Minister of State for Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, the position he held till March 2015.
Meanwhile, Maharashtra assembly elections were held in October 2014. BJP came to power and Devendra Fadnavis became first BJP Chief Minister of Maharashtra. However, as per the BJP culture, one person only holds one post a time, and hence Devendra Fadnavis resigned as the President of Maharashtra BJP and the search for a new leader commenced. Raosaheb Danve indicated to the party leadership that he was willing to resign as a minister and in January 2015 he was appointed as the President of Maharashtra BJP by Amit Shah, the national President of BJP. Raosaheb Danve is only the second person in Maharashtra BJP to hold this office while also being a Member of Parliament. Earlier, late Suryabhan Vahadane-Patil had successfully carried the dual responsibility.
Danve has attracted controversy due to his freewheeling public comments that may be misconstrued objectionably. For example, in 2016, a FIR was lodged against him for asking voters to accept Laxmi coming to their homes on election eve (alluding to vote buying). When the prices of "Tur" fell in May 2017, Danve used the term "saale" to chide the "oversensitive farmers". Use of such term was criticised by the opposition parties and Danve expressed his regrets concerning his comment. Later, in 2019, he said that the word "saale" is a common slang term which is not derogatory in rural marathwada, and he never intended to offend farmers.
In May 2019, Danve became Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.
In June 2024, Danve lost the election for the 18th Lok Sabha to Kalyan Kale of Indian National Congress.

Bloomington High School South

Bloomington High School South (simply referred to as BHSS or South) is a public high school in Bloomington, Indiana, United States. It is part of the Monroe County Community School Corporation. The school is accredited by the Indiana State Department of Public Instruction and the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.
History.
Bloomington High School South originated as Indiana University Seminary School, or just the State Seminary, in 1820. Indiana State Seminary was a prep school for Indiana University until University High School was built in the 1930s, which allowed it to become Bloomington High School (BHS), a general high school. It was housed, for many years, in a three-story brick building at the current site of Seminary Square Park, and was considered Bloomington's central high school by 1864. As Bloomington grew, BHS slowly evolved and began to house more students. The Gothic yearbook began in 1909 and The Optimist newspaper in 1911. Both were started at BHS and are still in publication as of 2024.
In 1965, a new high school building was built for BHS on South Walnut Street. When BHS vacated Seminary Square, the old building was turned into a middle school called Central Junior High School. On April 6, 1967, an arsonist started a fire in the school's gymnasium. Both the Bloomington Fire Department and the Ellettsville Fire Department were quick to the scene, and over 8,200,000 gallons of water were used in their attempt to extinguish the flames. Inadequate emergency water systems in the area, however, left them unable to save the building, and it collapsed several hours later. The building was subsequently razed, and the property became Seminary Square Park, named after the original Indiana Seminary.
In 1972, University High School and Unionville High School (the closest county high school outside the city of Bloomington) were closed along with Smithville High School. BHS became Bloomington High School South (BHSS), with mascot and school colors (purple and white) reminiscent of those of the former BHS.
Later, the fall of that same year, as a result of the 1968 school consolidation plan which formed the Monroe County Community School Corporation, Bloomington High School North (BHSN) was built with students from the closed University and Unionville High Schools along with some transfer students from BHSS.
The zonal boundary that determines which Bloomington high school a student will attend forms a jagged line that intersects the city. The zoning is such that one student who actually lives north of another, may in fact attend "South", while the other attends "North". This geographic divide was contentious given that the MCCSC school board decided to send the most prominent socioeconomic neighborhood (Hyde Park) to North to reduce in economic/academic inequity. The map can be obtained from the Monroe County Community School Corporation. The two schools have remained contentious rivals in most sporting events since the creation of BHSN in 1972.
Athletics.
The Panthers compete in the Conference Indiana, with their main rival being the cross-town Bloomington High School North Cougars. They have won a total of 29 IHSAA Championships, tied for the 5th most in the state. 
The 2009 boys basketball team finished with a 26–0 record to become one of the few team in state history to record no losses. 
Extracurricular activities.
Music.
The Bloomington South and Bloomington North string orchestras together form the Hoosier Youth Philharmonic, which has performed nationally and internationally, including a concert at Carnegie Hall on March 14, 2012.
South's advanced classical and show choir, Sounds of South, is among the most prestigious in the state. Sounds of South has made the ISSMA mixed choir state finals 28 times, and made second eight times. Sounds of South has won first place in the ISSMA mixed choir championships twice, in 1989 and 2023. Since its founding in 1985 by its current director and conductor, Gwen Witten Upchurch, over 700 students have been in the choir. The choir performs nationally, notably in Orlando, FL; New York City, NY; Chicago, IL; and Nashville, TN.

Kris Sivara

Kris Sivara (Thai: กฤษณ์ สีวะรา, , alternatively transcribed as "Srivara") (27 March 1914 – 28 April 1976) was a military officer of the Royal Thai Army, a member of the Thai Cabinet, and deputy commander-in-chief of the Royal Thai Army during the violent crackdown on democracy protesters on 14 October 1973. He was later promoted to Commander in Chief of the Royal Thai Army from 1973 to 1975.
Career.
During the Burma Campaign in World War II, Kris served as a company commander in a Phayap Army battalion under the command of Major Sarit Thanarat.
Kris was appointed Deputy Minister of Education by Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn in his 1969 government. On 23 November 1970, he was switched to Deputy Minister of Defence (Thanom was both premier and minister of defence). The government fell on 17 November 1971 after Thanom led a coup that overthrew his own government and abrogated the 1968 constitution. Thanom appointed Kris Minister of Industry in his subsequent junta.
Kris played a pivotal role in the 14 October democracy movement of 1973. Kris served as Deputy Army Commander in the face of massive public demonstrations against the "three tyrants": Colonel Narong Kittikachorn, Army Commander Field Marshal Praphas Charusathien, and Prime Minister and Supreme Commander Thanom Kittikachorn. On the evening of 14 October, the police and army began shooting at demonstrators, killing at least 70. Narong shot into the crowds from a helicopter. Thanom and Praphas resigned from their political roles, but continued to lead the military. They ordered more troops to confront the remaining demonstrators, but were blocked by Kris. Thanom and Narong then resigned from their military positions. The king then appointed Sanya Dharmasakti as premier. Kris was named defense minister in 1976, but died a week later in April 1976. His death has been called "...sudden and strange..."
Kris's role in the events was countered by Narong in a 2003 book. Narong blamed Kris, among others, for the violence. The book was strongly criticised by former student leaders.
The army's Kris Sivara Camp in Sakon Nakhon Province is named after him.

St. John's Church, Helsinki

St. John's Church (, ) in Helsinki, Finland, is a Lutheran church designed by the Swedish architect in the Gothic Revival style. It is the largest stone church in Finland by seating capacity.
Description.
"Johannes" (John) church stands on a hill that for many centuries had been a place for Midsummer bonfires (Midsummer is now also "John's Day", "Juhannus" in Finnish).
Situated in the Ullanlinna district of Helsinki, the church was built between 1888 and 1891, the third Lutheran church in Helsinki, and still the biggest. The twin towers are in height, and the church seats 2,600 people and has excellent acoustics, and it is therefore used for big concerts and events as well as services. The altarpiece shows Saul's conversion and the painting, called "A Divine Revelation", is by Eero Järnefelt, brother-in-law to Jean Sibelius.
In August 2022 a six-month renovation of the church was completed, in which the gargoyles of the church were repaired and renewed due to their poor condition; Helsinki's raw sea air and weather fluctuations on both sides of zero had damaged the condition of the concrete decorations and it was feared that they would crumble and fall in time.
Organ.
The organ was built in 1891 by German company Walcker of Ludwigsburg, with a pneumatic mechanism. At the time it was the largest in Finland. In 1921, composer Oskar Merikanto, the first church organist, expanded the organ. In 2004 and 2005, the organ was renovated by German organ builder ; it now has 66 stops and 4,036 pipes.
In 2018 an English-style shell organ, by Urkurakentamo Veikko Virtanen Oy from Espoo, was installed. It has nine voices and a movable soundboard.

Girolamini, Naples

The Church of the Girolamini (also spelled "Gerolomini"), also known as the Church of Saint Philip Neri, is a church and ecclesiastical complex in Naples, Italy. It stands directly across from the Cathedral of Naples on Via Duomo. Its façade faces the square and the street of the same name (Via Tribunali), opposite Santa Maria della Colonna. The complex is located one block west of Via Duomo.
History.
The church was built site of an earlier building, the Palazzo Seripando, which was bought in 1586 with 5500 ducats for the priests of the Congregation of the Oratory of St Philip Neri. Archbishop Mario Carafa, had requested disciples from the order, and received the future cardinal Francesco Tarugi. Once the Palace was demolished, construction started in 1592 using by the Florentine architect Giovanni Antonio Dosio, with help by Nencioni. Completed in 1619, the church was in a sober Florentine Renaissance style, with a Latin cross with three naves supported by arcuated colonnades and with lateral chapels. It was initially consecrated to the Birth of the Virgin of and All Saints (Ognisanti).
There are two cloisters: the first cloister is called the "chiostro maiolicato" from its embedded maiolica tiles. A much larger second 17th-century cloister, is accessible through the first; this cloister hosts the entry to both the "Quadreria" or art collection, which had been previously housed in the sacristy of the Church, and the magnificent library of the Oratorian Fathers, the "Biblioteca Girolamini", now run by the Italian state. The façade and other reconstructions were completed by Ferdinando Fuga in 1780. The façade statues of St Peter or St Paul were sculpted by Giuseppe Sammartino.
The Church and the convent gallery contain works by major artists. The lavish gilt ceiling was badly damaged during aerial bombardment in February 1944, but has been partially restored.
The church counterfacade has a Giordano painting of "Jesus ejects the moneylenders from the Temple". The lateral doors have frescoes of "Heliodorus and the Angel" and "Oza morto presso l’Arca" by Filippo Mazzante. The first chapel on the right has an altarpiece depicting "Saints Giorgio and Pantaleone" by the Bolognese Gaetano Pandolfi; to the side are paintings of "St Dominic" and the "Guardian Angel" are by Francesco Fracanzano, pupil of Ribera; above is a painting of "Saints Cosma and Damiano" by Benasca. The 2nd chapel on the right has a small "Madonna della Neve" by a follower of Polidoro di Caravaggio, the paintings of "God and Sts Anne and Joseph" are by Giuseppe Marulli. Francesco di Maria painted "St Anne and S. Gioacchino with the Angel". The paintings in the 3rd chapel are by Luca Giordano. The 4th chapel on the right has a "St Agnese", by Cristoforo Roncalli (il Pomarancio). Giovanni Battista Vico and his wife, Caterina Destito have funereal plaques in this chapel. The 5th chapel has a "St. Francis in Ecstasy" by Guido Reni. The frescoes in this chapel are by Morandi. The canvas of the "Virgin and Apostles" in the sixth chapel was painted by Paolo de Matteis, while Francesco la Mura painted the lateral canvases.
The church and complex take their name of "Girolamini" from that which was first applied to the priests of the Oratory and which is derived from the Church of San Girolamo della Carità in Rome, where St Philip Neri first established his religious exercises.
Sacristy.
Entered from the right transept, the sacristy displays a series of painting including a "St. Francis in Ecstasy" (1622) and "Jesus meets St John the Baptist" (1622) by Guido Reni, and a "St. Nicholas of Bari saves three children from a vat", "San Carlo Borromeo kisses the hand of St Phillip Neri", "St Charles Borromeo and St. Philip Neri" by Giordano. The next room has a ceiling fresco depicting the "Glory of St Philip Neri" by Beinaschi.
Biblioteca Girolamini.
The Biblioteca Girolamini is the library associated with the church since the 16th century. It previously contained thousands of manuscripts and printed volumes.
Looting in 2012.
In December 2013, it was reported that there had been systematic looting of the Biblioteca Girolamini. Images showed empty shelves and tables piled with papers. Senior Police investigator, Major Antonio Coppola, was quoted as saying, "Our investigations found that there was a true criminal system in action," and that "A group of people... carried out a devastating, systematic looting of the library." The report stated that Professor Tomaso Montanari, an art historian and academic, first alerted the police to what was happening, after having gained access to the library along with a student in early 2012. The Professor said, "One of the library's members of staff took me aside, away from the CCTV cameras, and said: 'Professor, the director (Marino Massimo de Caro) has been looting the library!'" de Caro had been appointed in 2011.
De Caro was arrested soon after investigations began in 2012. Investigations showed that vehicle-loads of books had been removed and sold by the now-convicted criminals, who had waited until after normal working hours, turned off the rudimentary CCTV system, and then proceeded with their looting.
De Caro was convicted along with accomplices in early 2013 and sentenced to seven years jail, although, due to his cooperation this was commuted to house arrest. Around 80% of the lost volumes had been recovered by late 2013, with the assistance of antiquarian booksellers and collectors, although many valuable artefacts remain unaccounted for.
In 2019 Giancarlo Petrella published about incunabula at the library based on early catalogs.

Powrie Castle

Powrie Castle is a ruined 16th-century castle located in the north of Dundee, Scotland. It was designated as a scheduled monument in 1971. The early 17th-century north range of the castle is now a separate fortified house and has been converted into a private residence. It itself is a Category A listed building.
History.
Originally known as Wester Powrie, the estate was purchased by Thomas Fothringham in 1412 who built a castle of which nothing is known. That structure was destroyed by the Scrymgeours in 1492 and the current castle, built of pink and buff sandstone rubble, probably replaced it in the 16th century. It may have been damaged as part of the Rough Wooing; if so it was repaired. It was after this incident that the castle was enlarged with east and north domestic ranges. Little survives of the east range, although it was known as "Lady Kinneard's quarters" or "the ladies quarter". The north range was built in 1604 by the Thomas Fothringham who married Barbara Scott in 1593. With the disappearance of the east range and the western boundary wall, the castle now appears as two separate buildings forming a courtyard. The family appears to have remained in the main building until at least 1684. 
A National Trust for Scotland competition was later held to design a plan to restore the north range. This was won by Gillian Strickland who was awarded ownership of the castle as a result. It was adapted as a private residence in 1978–1981 by architect D. C. Leslie.
Description.
The final layout of the main castle was as a two-storey rectangular Z-plan structure with round towers at the north east and south west corners. The western part of the building has collapsed. The north wing was built in a more renaissance style with a vaulted ground floor and a small round tower at the north west corner.

This Is Nollywood

This Is Nollywood is a 2007 Nigerian documentary film by Franco Sacchi and Robert Caputo, detailing the Nigerian film industry, much along the same lines as the acclaimed 2007 documentary "Welcome to Nollywood" by Jamie Meltzer
Through the story of director Bond Emeruwa, this documentary tells the story of a $250 million industry that has created thousands of jobs. As the documentary follows Emeruwa's production of "Check Point", various members of the Nigerian filmmaking community discuss their industry, defend the types of films they make and the impact they have, and describe common difficulties they encounter, from hectic shooting schedules to losing electricity mid-shoot.
Synopsis.
"This is Nollywood" follows Nigerian director Bond Emeruwa on his quest to finish filming a feature-length action movie in nine days on the outskirts of Lagos. However, Bond is just one of the incredible protagonists of Nollywood, Nigeria’s burgeoning, but little known movie industry that is rapidly changing Africa's modern popular culture. In the end, the film is about more than a fascinating and unheralded movie industry, it is about how people surmount obstacles to achieve their dreams.

Samuel Sloan (architect)

Samuel Sloan (March 7, 1815 – July 19, 1884) was a Philadelphia-based architect and best-selling author of architecture books in the mid-19th century. He specialized in Italianate villas and country houses, churches, and institutional buildings. His most famous building—the octagonal mansion "Longwood" in Natchez, Mississippi—is unfinished; construction was abandoned during the American Civil War.
Early life, marriage, and family.
Born on March 7, 1815, in Honeybrook Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, the son of William Sloan and Mary Kirkwood, Sloan trained as a carpenter and came to Philadelphia in the mid-1830s. He is said to have worked with John Haviland on Eastern State Penitentiary and with Isaac Holden on the former Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane.
Samuel Sloan married Mary Pennell in 1843. Their children were Ellwood Pennell, Howard L., Laura W., and Ada. He had three grandchildren by his eldest son, Ellwood. They were Maurice, Helen and Samuel A. Sloan.
Career.
By 1851, Sloan had won a commission for the Delaware County, Pennsylvania, courthouse and jail, and designed Andrew Eastwick's villa "Bartram Hall" near the site of Bartram's Garden in Philadelphia. These successes prompted him to begin to list his vocation as "architect".
Authorship.
Sloan became a prolific author on architecture most notably for "The Model Architect" as well as "City and Suburban Architecture" and "Sloan's Constructive Architecture" (1859). In 1861, he wrote "Sloan's Homestead Architecture and American Houses", and "A Variety of Designs for Rural Buildings". Sloan also reached thousands of potential customers through the pages of "Godey's Lady's Book", which began publishing his designs in 1852.
"The man who has a home," wrote Sloan in 1871, "feels a love for it a thankfulness for its possession and a proportionate determination to uphold and defend it against all invading influences. Such a man is, of necessity . . . a good citizen; for he has a stake in society."
Economic downturns and work outside Philadelphia area.
Economic downturns in the late 1850s as well as the American Civil War put a halt to his professional success and Sloan briefly left Philadelphia for New York in 1867. Important examples of his later work are found outside Pennsylvania, notably in Morganton, North Carolina's Western State Asylum for the Insane. Sloan ended up building about 20 hospitals for the insane based on the "Kirkbride Plan System".
Sloan enjoyed some later success in North Carolina, opening an office in Raleigh, where he died on July 19, 1884. His body was buried in Mount Moriah Cemetery, Philadelphia, Lot 11 Sec 20.
Associated architects.
Architects associated with Sloan include: Charles M. Autenrieth (1828–1906), Edward Collins (1821–1902), Willis G. Hale (1848–1907), Addison Hutton (1834–1916), John S. Stewart and Thomas Webb Richards (1836–1911), Isaac Pursell (1853–1910), and Charles Balderston (1852–1924). his half-brother, Fletcher Sloan, was also an architect.

Randy Hultgren

Randall Mark Hultgren (; born March 1, 1966) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2011 to 2019. He is a member of the Republican Party.
Hultgren represented the 48th district Senate seat in the Illinois General Assembly from 2007 to 2011. The 48th Senate District includes parts of DuPage, Kane, and Will counties and all or part of Aurora, Batavia, Geneva, Naperville, North Aurora, Warrenville, West Chicago, Wheaton, and Winfield.
In his 2018 reelection campaign, Hultgren was defeated by Democratic nominee Lauren Underwood.
Early life, education, and early political career.
Randall Mark "Randy" Hultgren, the youngest of three children of Vernon H. Hultgren and JoAnne R. Hultgren, lived in Park Ridge, Illinois from 1966 to 1977.
In September 1976, Paul W. Hanerhoff, the owner of Hanerhoff Funeral Home in downtown Wheaton, Illinois since 1943, died. In May 1977, Dorothy B. Hanerhoff sold the funeral home to Hultgren's father, and it was called the Hanerhoff-Hultgren Funeral Home until 1987, when it became the Hultgren Funeral Home. The Hultgrens moved from Park Ridge to Wheaton in 1977 and lived upstairs from the funeral home for eight years. Hultgren attended Wheaton Academy in West Chicago, Illinois, graduating in 1984.
Hultgren, whose grandfather was a Baptist pastor, then became the third generation of his family to attend Bethel College &amp; Seminary in Arden Hills, Minnesota, where he earned a B.A. "magna cum laude" in political science and speech communication in 1988.
He next moved to Washington, D.C. to work as an aide to Republican U.S. Representative Dennis Hastert (IL-14) from 1988 to 1990, where he rose from intern to office manager.
Hultgren then returned to his hometown where in 1990, he purchased a small house and was elected Republican precinct committeeman for Milton Township Precinct 20 in Wheaton, and began attending the Illinois Institute of Technology Chicago-Kent College of Law in Chicago. In 1991 he married Christy L. Nungesser after she graduated from Bethel College. In August 1992 Hultgren had his small house demolished and had a historic 125-year-old Wheaton house he purchased for $1 moved one block west to his lot and had a new foundation poured under it. In 1993 he earned a J.D. from IIT Chicago-Kent.
In October 1993, he announced he would run in the March 1994 Republican primary for the DuPage County Board District 4 seat being vacated by Gwen Henry in her bid to be DuPage County Board Chairman. In the March 1994 Republican primary, the then 27-year-old first-time candidate Hultgren narrowly edged Wheaton City Councilman Grant Eckhoff by only 252 votes, a margin of less than 1%, out of almost 22,000 Republican ballots cast in DuPage County Board District 4. Hultgren received a great deal of support from those who had backed Peter Roskam of Wheaton in Roskam's first campaign for Illinois House District 40 two years earlier. In the November 1994 general election Hultgren and incumbent Republican DuPage County District 4 board member Pat Carr of Wheaton easily defeated their two Democratic opponents. Hultgren served one 4-year term as one of the then all-Republican 24-member DuPage County Board from December 1994 to December 1998. DuPage County Board members at that time also served as DuPage County Forest Commissioners.
Illinois House of Representatives.
Elections.
In 1998, incumbent Republican State Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois's 40th House District decided to retire to run for Congress. Hultgren ran and won unopposed. He won reelection to a second term unopposed in 2000. After redistricting, Hultgren decided to run in the newly redrawn 95th House District and defeated Democrat Dirk Enger 61%–37%.
Committee assignments.
Hultgren was on the Death Penalty Committee and the Education Committee.
Illinois Senate.
Elections.
In 2006, incumbent State Senator Peter Roskam of Illinois's 48th Senate District decided to retire to run for Congress again. Hultgren ran and won the Republican primary 60%–40% over Naperville City Councilman Dick Furstenau. He won the general election unopposed. In 2008 he won reelection to a second term unopposed.
U.S. House of Representatives.
Elections.
2010.
On September 28, 2009, Hultgren announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in and won the party's nomination in the February 2 primary election. Hultgren defeated Democratic incumbent Bill Foster 51%–45%.
2012.
During his first term, Hultgren represented a hybrid suburban-rural district that stretched from the outer western suburbs of Chicago through Dixon all the way to Cambridge on the other side of the state.
As a result of the decennial reapportionment following the 2010 Census, Illinois lost one seat in the US House of Representatives. The new district map (now with only 18 districts, and drawn by the Democratic-controlled Illinois General Assembly) saw Hultgren's district lose its vast western portion, becoming much more compact and centered around Chicago's outer western suburbs. Notably, it absorbed most of McHenry County, the only collar county Barack Obama did not win in 2012.
The redrawn 14th included areas previously part of the neighboring 8th district, represented by fellow freshman Republican Joe Walsh. The new map drew Walsh's home, along with much of the McHenry County portion of the old 8th, into the 14th. At the same time the 8th was made significantly more Democratic, prompting Walsh to consider challenging Hultgren in the primary for the much friendlier 14th. But soon after Hultgren sought a second term in the 14th, Walsh decided to run in the 8th district. In the general election, Hultgren won reelection to a second term, beating Democratic candidate Dennis Anderson with 59% of the vote.
2014.
Hultgren ran for a third term and was opposed by Dennis Anderson for a second time. Hultgren again defeated Anderson, this time with 65% of the vote.
2016.
Hultgren defeated Democrat Jim Walz in the November 2016 general election with 59% of the vote.
2018.
Hultgren ran for reelection in 2018. He was unopposed in the Republican primary. Lauren Underwood won the March 20 Democratic primary with 57.35% of the vote. Others receiving votes were Matt Brolley, Jim Walz, Victor Swanson, John Hosta, George Weber, and Daniel Roldan-Johnson. Underwood defeated Hultgren in the November general election with 52% of the vote to Hultgren's 48%.
Tenure.
Hultgren served on the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (Helsinki Commission) from 2015 to 2019. In this role, he worked “to promote human rights, stability, and security in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA) region," placing “special priority in protecting religious liberties, preventing human rights violations, combating human trafficking, and preventing Russian aggression into neighboring countries.” Hultgren was also a Commissioner on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, where he worked to "raise awareness about political prisoners who are being deprived of civil and political rights by their own government.”
In February 2017, Hultgren was appointed the co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, which “promotes international human rights through hearings, briefings and other awareness-building activities, and by providing expertise on key issues”.
Committee assignments.
Hultgren was a member of the Republican Study Committee and the Climate Solutions Caucus.

During the 2008 Republican Party presidential primaries, Hultgren worked on the presidential campaign of former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson, serving as a congressional district chair for Illinois's 14th congressional district.
Hultgren has been described as a member of the Tea Party movement.
Domestic issues.
Education.
Hultgren has been an advocate for homeschooling, as his 4 children are homeschooled, and he believes that "homeschooling is the ultimate local control." In 2011 Hultgren introduced the Family Educational Records Privacy Extension Act (H.R. 2910), which would have required "parental consent before educational agencies or institutions release the educational records of home-schooled students."
Environment.
Hultgren opposed federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. He has described cap-and-trade as "an irresponsible policy".
In 2010, Hultgren signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, promising to vote against any climate-change legislation that would raise taxes. The League of Conservation Voters gave Hultgren an environmental rating of 0% for 2017 and a lifetime rating of 5%.
Gun control.
Hultgren is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. In April 2018, after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, Hultgren urged schools and police to do a better job of identifying and intervening with people who are potential threats. “We need to do more to make sure people who are speaking out and acting out or have mental challenges don't get weapons, that people who have criminal histories don't get weapons, and when hearing of a threat we respond quickly,” he said.
Healthcare.
Hultgren favored repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). On May 4, 2017, he voted to repeal Obamacare and pass the American Health Care Act.
Hultgren supported a bill that would allow employers to exclude veterans receiving health insurance from the United States Department of Defense or the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs from their list of employees. This would keep their list of employees shorter, allowing some small businesses to fall underneath the 50 full-time employees line that would require them to provide their employees with healthcare under the Affordable Care Act.
Identity fraud.
Hultgren and 3 other members of Congress sponsored the Protecting Children from Identity Theft Act, H.R. 5192, which would require the Social Security Administration (SSA) to take a more active role in preventing identity theft.
Donald Trump.
Hultgren endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.
Economic issues.
National debt.
In 2013, Hultgren voted for legislation stop an increase of the debt limit, which led to a government shutdown. He was the only congressperson from Illinois to vote against an agreement to reopen government and end the government shutdown.
Taxes.
Hultgren sponsored legislation to repeal the estate tax and voted to repeal it several times.
In November 2017, Hultgren and Peter Roskam introduced the Bring Small Business Back Tax Reform Act as part of the Trump Administration's tax reform package. Hultgren said the bill was intended “to cut the overall small business tax rate to 25 percent,” a change he said would “provide much-needed relief to the engine of Illinois's economy.”
Tariffs.
In June 2018, Hultgren and Roskam expressed their disapproval of Trump's plan to impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and the European Union. “There's real concern about what an escalating trade war would mean,” said Hultgren, who articulated concern about the impact of such tariffs on manufacturers and farmers in his district.
Budget.
Hultgren supported a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Hultgren and Andy Barr (R-KY) introduced legislation that would compel the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the privacy risks associated with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Home Mortgage Disclosure Act rule. The legislation would also prohibit depository institutions, the CFPB, and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council from making available to the public any information gathered in accordance with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.
Banking.
On March 6, 2018, the House passed without opposition H.R. 4725, the Community Bank Reporting Relief Act, sponsored by Hultgren and two other Members of Congress. The law simplifies reporting requirements for community banks. “The role of smaller financial institutions is especially important in more rural areas, such as my district, where larger banks tend to not have as many branches”, said Hultgren.
Corporations.
Hultgren was a vocal opponent of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which created new financial regulations after the 2008 financial crisis. He called Dodd-Frank "flawed" and introduced Republican-backed legislation to end it. Hultgren supported the Financial CHOICE Act, another Republican-backed bill to dismantle Dodd-Frank; the legislation would have eliminated the Treasury Department's Office of Financial Research, killed the Volcker Rule (which bars certain banks from particular risky trades); killed the Orderly Liquidation Authority (which allows the federal government to shut down failing banks that post a systemic risk to the economy); and removed a provision imposing greater oversight on "systemically important financial institutions." Hultgren introduced the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act into the House in March 2013; the bill would have rolled back Dodd-Frank regulations and expand banks' authority to use swaps to hedging risk. The bill passed the House but not the Senate and did not become law.
Hultgren was a strong advocate of municipal finance and tax-exempt municipal bonds. In 2013 he joined with fellow U.S. Representative Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD) in securing the signatures of 137 House Republicans and Democrats in a letter urging congressional leaders to "reject any proposal to cap or eliminate the deduction on tax-exempt municipal bonds used to finance the vast majority of infrastructure projects in America’s communities." The two circulated a similar letter in 2015 and formed the Municipal Finance Caucus in 2016.
International issues.
Immigration.
"Immigration is a foundational part of who we are...to be a place of refuge," Hultgren told the Chicago Tribune in September 2017. "I understand that there are bad actors and terrorists out there ... but I don't want to shut off opportunity for people who really need refuge."
In December 2015, citing religious freedom, Hultgren criticized presidential candidate Donald Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. “Singling out any faith community for the actions of extremists is not conservative, it is hostile to our founding,” he said.
Human rights in China.
In September 2017, Hultgren hosted a screening of Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei's film "Human Flow", about the refugee crisis in 23 countries. The "Chicago Tribune" wrote that Hultgren had "taken up the cause of Zhu Yufu, a Chinese dissident poet jailed for publishing pro-democracy poetry."
On February 14, 2018, Hultgren delivered a statement on the House floor wishing a happy birthday to Zhu Yufu, a prisoner of conscience in China, and calling on Chinese authorities to release him from detention. Hultgren had “adopted” Zhu Yufu to highlight his plight as part of the Defending Freedoms Project, a joint effort by the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), and Amnesty International USA. The next day the Lantos Commission, which Hultgren co-chaired, hosted a hearing on prisoners of conscience.
Russia.
Hultgren supported H.R. 3364, the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which became law in August 2017. It authorized sanctions against Iran, North Korea, and Russia. Hultgren also welcomed the indictment in February 2018 of 13 Russian nationals and 3 Russian entities. In March 2018, he expressed approval of Congressional sanctions on “Russian individuals and entities” who had engaged in “long-running, coordinated and malicious attempts to influence and disrupt our American elections and political system.” He also welcomed the Trump administration's implementation of the sanctions. “These actions send a clear message that our electoral system is not to be tampered with, and the United States will respond when we or our allies are attacked”, Hultgren said.
Social issues.
Abortion.
Hultgren was identified by Vote Smart as anti-abortion. He favored a prohibition on embryonic stem cell research.
Sex education.
Hultgren sponsored legislation to allocate $110 million per year in federal grants for abstinence education in schools.
LGBT rights.
Hultgren opposed same-sex marriage. He voted to uphold the Defense of Marriage Act. In 2015, Hultgren cosponsored a resolution to amend the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage.
Basic research.
Hultgren was described by the American Physical Society as an "outspoken advocate for basic scientific research and STEM education." According to NBC Chicago, "the conservative Republican has carved a reputation as a pro-science, pro-STEM education supporter."
Hultgren went on record to note that "The U.S. research system is unique. We’ve found an incredibly powerful combination, wedding education and research by incorporating universities, user facilities and Department of Energy resources. But this system is only as stable our commitment to it, which is why sustained and predictable research funding is crucial".""
Along with then United States Senator Mark Udall (D-CO), Hultgren was awarded the George Brown Science Technology Engineering Leadership award by the Science, Technology, Engineering Working Group, a coalition of pro-science groups including The American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Institute of Physics, and ASME.
In October 2012, Hultgren was a recipient of the Champion of Science Award by the Science Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group composed of the 50 leading research universities in the United States. The award was presented by Fermilab Director Pier Oddone and University of Illinois President Robert Easter along with University of Chicago President Robert Zimmer, who said, "Congressman Hultgren provides a strong voice for science in Congress."
Hultgren introduced the American Super Computing Leadership Act (H.R. 2495; 113th Congress) in the House on June 25, 2013. The bill would require the United States Department of Energy to improve and increase its use of high-end computers, especially exascale computing, through an organized research program.
Women's rights.
Hultgren voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act in 2013.
Personal life.
In 2002, Hultgren moved 4 miles southwest from Wheaton to adjacent Winfield, Illinois. In 2014, he moved 22 miles southwest from Winfield in DuPage County to Plano, Illinois, in Kendall County. Hultgren lives in Plano with his wife, Christy, and their four children, who have been home-schooled.
He is an evangelical Christian and a member of Wheaton Bible Church.

Aulacocerida

Aulacocerida is an order of primitive coleoid cephalopods, possibly derived from michelinoceraitids (Orthocerida) early in the Devonian, which in turn gave rise to the Belemnites.
Aulococerids are characterized by a straight, slim, conical shell with a large living chamber, simple aperture. The protoconch (initial, embryonic chamber) is egg-shaped and separated from the phragmocone by a constriction. The siphuncle is narrow and ventral, constricted at the septa and expanded in the middle of the chamber; necks are retrochoantiic, project backwards toward the apex. Nacre recovered from aulococerids as well as from belemnites resembles that found in recent "Sepia" and "Spirula" but differs from that of recent "Nautilus".
Opinions vary as to whether aulococerids were endocochleate, having internal shells as with modern squid, or were ectocochleate, having external shells as with nautiloids and ammonites. Naef (in Bandel 1985) thought of aulacocerids as slender squids that looked similar to recent ones; morphologically similar to belemnites on one hand and to orthocerids on the other, but with a mantle that completely covered the shell; making them endocochliate. Jeletzky (in Bandel 1985) considered that aulocerids were essentially ectocochleate and that they lacked a muscular mantle, the rostrum having been secreted by mantle flaps that could be folded over the chambered shell, but were not fused around it, and which could be withdrawn into the long living chamber.

The Ones

The Ones are an American electronic dance music group. Their 2001 hit single "Flawless" peaked within the top ten of the charts in Belgium and the United Kingdom. The trio consisted of three male vocalists Paul Alexander, JoJo Americo, and Nashom Wooden, who met while working at the Greenwich Village boutique Patricia Field. Each of them has a background in performing, DJing, and being stylists within the underground New York club and fashion scenes.
Their debut single, "Flawless", was inspired by the 1999 film, which Nashom appeared in alongside Robert De Niro. It was first released on the New York based A Touch of Class Recordings label in 1999, and was popular among New York DJs even before its official release. In 2004, "Flawless" was sampled and had lyrics added to it by English singer and former Wham! member George Michael for his song "Flawless (Go to the City)". Michael's version peaked at number eight on the UK Singles Chart in July 2004, almost three years after the original had peaked at number seven on the chart. The group released a follow-up single, "Superstar", which reached number 45 in the same country.
In November 2006, they released "Ultramodern", with a music video and clips available on A Touch of Class's website. The Ones signed to Peacebisquit management in 2007. They tweaked their look and sound and released a 2008 single, "When We Get Together", with a video clip featuring cameos from the Scissor Sisters, Debbie Harry, Jody Watley, Fischerspooner, Ultra Naté, Peppermint, Cazwell, Colton Ford, and many others. Nomi Ruiz collaborated with the Ones on their single "Let's Celebrate!" from their fourth album "Blast from the Past".
In August 2013, Cher released the video "A Woman's World" and almost immediately fans of the Ones complained of similarities to the Ones' video "Face &amp; Body" which was released months earlier the same year. The band saw the comparison more as a compliment than controversy.
Nashom Wooden died on March 23, 2020, after reportedly contracting COVID-19.

Collombey-Muraz

Collombey-Muraz is a municipality in the district of Monthey in the canton of Valais in Switzerland.
Geography.
After the town of Saint-Maurice, the Rhône river flows north towards Lake Geneva. The plain widens on both sides of it, with an area called the Chablais valaisan on its left bank. The district of Monthey is part of it with its nine municipalities, one of which is Collombey-Muraz.
Collombey-Muraz includes the villages of Collombey, Muraz, Collombey-le-Grand, Illarsaz, and Les Neyres. Due to its high proportion of flat ground, it is one of the largest municipalities in the Valais, extending over 29.81 km2.
A survey in 2013-2018 established that housing and infrastructure represented 14.1% of its territory, agricultural areas 36.5%, wooded areas 40.0%, and unproductive areas 9.3%.
Seven alpine pastures, Chalet-Neuf, Conches, Chemeneau, Grand-Crau, Dreveneuse d’en Bas, Chermeux and Onnaz, extend over the heights bordering France. They are owned by the bourgeoisie, who rent them to farmers for the summer season.
The highest point of the municipality, La Pointe de Bellevue at 2,042 metres, offers a view stretching from Lake Geneva to the Dents du Midi. Since 2013, it has given its name to a popular foot race.
The villages.
Collombey.
Collombey is the largest of the municipality's five villages, with nearly 4,600 inhabitants at the end of 2016. It has experienced unprecedented growth since the 1990s with the construction of shopping centers and many residential buildings.
Muraz.
On a hillside, Muraz has long suffered from the whims of the two streams bordering it, which have destroyed crops and flooded homes. The village extends on either side of the cantonal road, between a mountain flank and the plain. Like other localities, Muraz has grown considerably and presently has some 2,700 inhabitants.
Collombey-le-Grand.
If the "grand" in Collombey-le-Grand ever indicated that the village was bigger or grander than neighbouring Collombey, then that was only true before the 12th century (according to Maurice Parvex, Collombey-Muraz). Today the village still deserves this qualifier if it includes the vast industrial area bordering it. With some 500 inhabitants, the village was originally huddled around the Chapel of Our Lady of the Seven Joys (chapelle Notre Dame des Sept-Joies) before experiencing considerable growth and extending into the plain.
Illarsaz.
Illarsaz is a quintessential valley floor village, on the road connecting Vionnaz to Aigle. It was once surrounded by marshes, which have now given way to agriculture. The locality consists mainly of individual villas for a population of about 700 inhabitants.
Les Neyres.
On a hillside, nestled between Monthey and Troistorrents, Les Neyres is the fifth and smallest village of the municipality. You have to take the Val d’Illiez road (route du Val d'Illiez) to discover Les Neyres, a scattered habitat of some 400 inhabitants. Like the other villages, Les Neyres has experienced strong growth in recent years, even prompting the municipality to reopen an infant school.
Transport.
The village of Collombey is served by two railway lines: the CFF Tonkin line (Saint-Maurice – Saint-Gingolph) and the AOMC regional train (Aigle – Ollon – Monthey - Champéry). In addition, a city bus travels hourly to Monthey. The five villages of the municipality are also connected to the surrounding localities by a bus service run by the Public Transport of Chablais (TPC).
Toponymy.
Collombey derives from the Latin noun cŏlumbārium, which refers either to a dovecote, or to a tomb or to a burial vault. It is not possible to know which applies, even though the municipality’s coat of arms includes doves.
Muraz derives from the Latin noun murum (plural: mura). It refers to a place consisting of remains of walls and constructions. The final z is silent, indicating that the accent is on the u and that the a is atonic.
In Valaisan patois, Collombey is pronounced "Collambâ".
History.
The geographical and political configuration as an autonomous municipality dates back to the division of the castellany of Monthey in 1787.
Geological evolution has left erratic blocks such as the Pierre à Dzo (300 m³), the Pierre à Muguet (1,000 m³), and the Bloc Studer (500 m³). The archaeological site of Châble-Croix, dating back to between 6880 and 6330 BC, could be the oldest in the Valais. From 1900 the exploitation of granite from the ancient glacial moraine uncovered Neolithic necropolises on the heights of Barmaz, dating back to the Neolithic age, around 3000 to 1800 BC.
The history of Collombey-Muraz was essentially agricultural until the 1960s.

It has experienced moments of glory with many excellent results both in Swiss wrestling and in freestyle wrestling, including numerous medals during the Swiss freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling championships of our former wrestlers, as well as participations in international championships. Our wrestlers have also displayed considerable agility in Swiss wrestling competitions, with numerous laurels and even a federal crown won by Alain Bifrare in 1986, in Sion. For several years, the club has been trying to organise as many competitions as possible within the municipality. In 2009, the Swiss freestyle wrestling championship took place here, with Florian Vieux finishing 3rd. In 2011, Collombey-Muraz hosted the Romand championship. During the summer of 2012, the Valaisan Cantonal Swiss Wrestling Festival took place at the Perraires; Sylvain Vieux was victorious there.

Economy.
Agriculture and environment.
Significant public works carried out during the Second World War enabled the intensification of crops and the modernization of equipment in the plain of the Rhône river. A monument by the Collombey-le-Grand - Illarsaz road commemorates these efforts (Collombey-Muraz, Maurice Parvex).
Environmental protection and careful town and country planning are constant concerns and the first development plan with its specific regulations dates from 1964. To this day, environment-minded projects are constantly being implemented. The main wastewater recovery network with related treatment plants have been operational since 1978.
Industry.
The opening of Switzerland's first oil refinery in 1960, supplied by a pipeline from Genoa, Italy, triggered a significant industrial boom. Constant efforts to attract industry and crafts have led to the development of industrial zones, mainly in Collombey and Collombey-le-Grand. Over the past 30 years, many companies have chosen Collombey-Muraz to house their headquarters.
In 2015, the refinery’s activities ceased, leaving some 250 people unemployed.
Culture and heritage.
Buildings.
Collombey.
"The Parish Church of Saint-Didier" "("Eglise paroissiale Saint-Didier)"." This church replaces an older building, built in 1616 by Bishop Hildebrand Jost and transformed in 1723. The current church was erected in 1873 by the architect Émile Vuilloud and transformed in 1949 by enlarging the choir bays. Restoration 1962-1963. This neo-Romanesque style building, with three naves and a semi-circular apse choir, has a bell tower-porch characterized crowned by four corner turrets. Inside are baptismal fonts from around 1700 and mosaics and stained glass windows by Paul Monnier, 1965.
Detailed article (in French): 
"The Manor of Châtillon-Larringes ("Manoir de Châtillon-Larringes")", located below the monastery, was rebuilt in 1653 after a fire. It was established on the site of the old tower of the nobles of Collombey, which had been passed on in the 14th century to Guillaume de Châtillon-Larringes, and which has been in the hands of the Du Fay de Lavallaz family since the beginning of the 17th century. The carriage door, in a full arch, goes back to 1633 and gives access to a service courtyard. Also present is a dwelling with a two-level portico and front body topped with a triangular gable, adorned with the painted Du Fey de Lavallaz coat of arms.
Collombey-le-Grand.
"The Chapel of the Seven Joys of the Virgin" (La chapelle des Sept-Joies-de-la-Vierge)"," completed in1855, contains a baroque altarpiece with a central painting from 1858, by Emmanuel Chapelet, illustrating the Virgin.
Muraz.
"The Parish Church of Saint-André" (Église paroissiale Saint-André) replaced an older building, according to 13th century records. It was rebuilt in 1615-1623 under the aegis of Bishop Hildebrand Jost. The original bell tower survives, with an octagonal spire pierced with dormer windows, reused as a bell tower-porch. The current church, in neo-Gothic style with a single nave, a polygonal choir and a ribbed vault, was built in 1898 by Joseph de Kalbermatten. It was restored between 1972 and 1974, and again in 2019. Inside, a neo-Gothic main altar with statues of saints Guillaume, Urbain, Thérèse and Rosalie frames the tabernacle.
"The Chapel of Our Lady of the Snows" (Chapelle Notre-Dame des Neiges") is a rectangular" 18th century building.
Illarsaz.
"The Chapel of Saint-Bernard-de-Montjoux" (Chapelle Saint-Bernard-de-Montjoux")" dates from 1965, when it replaced an 18th-century sanctuary. It is a concrete building with a detached bell tower. Inside, the baroque altar was taken from the old chapel and dates from the beginning of the 18th century. It displays the arms of Riedmatten and Stockalper. Mosaics and stained glass windows by Jean-Claude Morend.
Wells.
The high water table encouraged Collombey, Collombey-le-Grand and Illarsaz to dig many wells and thus ensure an adequate water supply to the inhabitants and livestock. Records such as the "Cahier de l’Association du Vieux Collombey-Muraz" even suggest that whenever a family decided to build a house, the first step was to dig a well. There were 62 of them, many of which still exist today for ornamental purposes. The municipality has recognized this particular treasure by dedicating a street and even a square to it: the Rue des Puits and the Place des Puits.
The Bakery.
The demolition in 2000 of a house in Collombey-Le-Grand revealed the existence of a village bread oven. This discovery triggered the idea of rebuilding a communal oven in order to, on the one hand, preserve and enhance its recoverable elements and, on the other, carry out a project of general interest. An association was created for this purpose and the inauguration of the new construction was held on September 21, 2002.
Since then, four related events now take place four times a year:
- Palm Sunday weekend
- Bread festival on the Saturday of the Federal Fast
- Patronal feast in November
- Advent window.
Music, theater and sociocultural activities.
Located near Monthey, whose cultural life is rich and varied, the municipality has its own music societies - Les Colombes and the Villageoise de Muraz - and a choir (Choeur Mixte).
An amateur theatre troupe, Théâtre du Rovra, has been offering a show to the local public every year since 1946.
Sociocultural infrastructure has been developed: a school and sports center with multipurpose rooms, a swimming pool, a children’s daycare centre, primary schools, an "orientation cycle", a municipal library, three football fields, tennis courts, a network of pedestrian paths and hiking trails, playgrounds, a covered area of 200 seats for societies and families. In terms of sports and cultural, 23 local societies enable some 2400 people to indulge in their favorite pastime.
Coat of arms.
Blazon.
The coat of arms of Collombey-Muraz combines doves, which represent Collombey, and a wall representing Muraz. Several variations have been recorded: with a dungeon and surrounding wall, with a tower instead of a dungeon, or with a solid wall with two of the three doves perched on it.

Tsarevitch Ivan, the Firebird and the Gray Wolf

"Tsarevich Ivan, the Firebird and the Gray Wolf" () is a Russian fairy tale collected by Alexander Afanasyev in "Russian Fairy Tales".
It is Aarne-Thompson type 550, the quest for the golden bird/firebird. Others of this type include "The Golden Bird", "The Greek Princess and the Young Gardener", "The Bird 'Grip, "How Ian Direach got the Blue Falcon", and "The Nunda, Eater of People".
Synopsis.
A king's apple tree bore golden apples, but every night, one was stolen. Guards reported that the Firebird stole them. The king told his two oldest sons that the one who caught the bird would receive half his kingdom and be his heir. They drew lots to see who would be first, but both fell asleep; they tried to claim it had not come, but it had stolen an apple. Finally Ivan Tsarevich, the youngest son, asked to try; his father was reluctant because of his youth but consented. Ivan remained awake the entire time, and upon seeing the bird, tried to catch it by the tail. Unfortunately, Ivan only managed to grasp one feather. The Firebird did not return, but the king longed for the bird. He said that still, whoever caught it would have half his kingdom and be his heir.
The older brothers set out. They came to a stone that said whoever took one road would know hunger and cold; whoever took the second would live, though his horse would die; and whoever took the third would die, though his horse would live. They did not know which way to take, and so took up an idle life.
Ivan begged to be allowed to go until his father yielded. He took the second road, and a wolf ate his horse. He walked until he was exhausted, and the wolf offered to carry him. It brought him to the garden where the firebird was and told him to take it out without touching its golden cage. The prince went in, but thought it was a great pity not to take the cage, but when he touched it, bells rang, waking everyone, and he was captured. He told his story, and the First King said he could have had it for the asking, but he could be spared now only if he could present the king with the Horse with the Golden Mane.
He met the wolf and admitted to his disobedience. It carried him to the kingdom and stables where he could get the horse and warned him against the golden bridle. Its beauty tempted him, and he touched it, and instruments of brass sounded. He was captured, and the Second King told him that if he had come with the word, he would have given him the horse, but now he would be spared only if he brought him Helen the Beautiful to be his wife.
Ivan went back to the wolf, confessed, and was brought to her castle. The wolf carried her off, but Ivan was able to assuage her fears. Ivan brought her back to the Second King, but wept because they had come to love each other. The wolf turned itself into the form of the princess and had Ivan exchange it for the Horse with the Golden Mane. Ivan and Helen rode off on the Horse. The wolf escaped the king. It reached Ivan and Helen, and Helen rode the horse and Ivan the wolf. Ivan asked the wolf to become like the horse and let him exchange it for the Firebird, so that he could keep the horse as well. The wolf agreed, the exchange was done, and Ivan returned to his own kingdom with Helen, the horse, and the Firebird.
The wolf said its service was done when they returned to where it had eaten Ivan's horse. Ivan dismounted and lamented their parting. They went on for a time and slept. His older brothers found them, killed Ivan, sliced his body to pieces, and told Helen that they would kill her if she would not say that they had fairly won the horse, the firebird, and her. They brought them to their father, and the second son received half the kingdom, and the oldest was to marry Helen.
The Grey Wolf found Ivan's body and caught two fledgling crows that would have eaten it. Their mother pleaded for them, and the wolf sent her to fetch the water of death, which restored the body, and the water of life, which revived him. The wolf carried him to the wedding in time to stop it; the older brothers were made servants or killed by the wolf, but Ivan married Helen and lived happily with her.
Translations.
The name of the Slavic Firebird is commonly kept as such in English translations. However, the bird can also be known by the name "Ohnivak", "Zhar Bird" or "Bird Zhar"; "Glowing Bird", "The Bird of Light", or "Fiery Bird".
This tale in particular was translated into English with the name "The Tale of Iván Tsarévich, the Bird of Light, and the Grey Wolf". In author Edith Hodgetts's translation, titled "The Grey Wolf and the Golden Cassowary", the bird is identified as a cassowary. In author Lilian Gask's translation, the shining bird is named "Magic Bird". translated the tale as "Prince John, the Fiery Bird and the Grey Wolf".
Analysis.
Tale type.
The tale is classified - and gives its name - to the East Slavic type SUS 550, , of the East Slavic Folktale Classification (): hero seeks the firebird, a horse and a princess with the aid of a gray wolf; jealous elder brothers kill him, but he is revived by the gray wolf.
Folklorist Jeremiah Curtin noted that the Russian, Slavic and German variants are many. On the other hand, scholar Andreas Johns noted that the tale type ATU 550 was diffused through East Slavic tradition by printed "lubok". The first appearance of the tale in Slavdom was in 1786, although Johns admits that the tale type "may have some roots in East Slavic tradition".
Motifs.
 suggested that the helpful gray wolf may have originated from an Eastern source. He also noted that the motif of resurrecting the hero with water of death and water of life was "a Russian characteristic".
Variants.
Russia.
In a Russian variant, "Ivan Tsarevich, the Gray Wolf and Elena the Most Beautiful", the prince must take part in a chain of deals: in order to obtain the golden bird, he first must capture the golden-maned horse from another kingdom; but, if he intends to obtain the horse, he must first kidnap foreign Princess Elena and deliver her to the tsar who owns the horse. A second Russian variant with a similar name was collected, titled "Ivan Tsarevich and the Gray Wolf".
Austrian writer and journalist published in 1841 a variant titled "Das Märchen vom Vogel Schar, dem Pferd mit der goldenen Mähne und vom grauen Wolf" ("The Tale of the Bird Schar, the Golden-Maned Horse and the Gray Wolf"): a Tsar named Wislaw Undronovitch has three sons, Dmitri, Vasili and Ivan Tsarevich. The tsar orders his sons to guard their garden from a nocturnal thief, but only Ivan discovers the culprit: a brilliant golden bird. After this revelation, the tsar sends his sons on a quest for the bird. this tale has also been translated into Croatian with the title "Carević Ivan, Žarka ptica i mrki vuk" ("Prince Ivan, The Firebird and the Dark Wolf"), keeping the names of the characters: Vislav Andronovič, Dmitrij, Vasilij and Ivan.
Russian author collected a variant titled "Жаръ-птица".
Georgia.
Similar variants exist in the Georgian Folktale Index, with the same numbering, ATU 550. In the Georgian type, titled "The Prince and the Wolf", the hero is sent for a wonderful bird and a maiden, and is helped by a wolf.
Ukraine.
In a Ukrainian tale collected by folklorist from Khust with the title "Железный волк" (Ukrainian: "Залізний вовк"; English: "The Iron Wolf"), the king's prized pear tree is being attacked by some thief that steals the golden pears, and the three princes are put on guard duty; the elder two fall asleep and fail, while the youngest, Mishko, stays awake and discovers the culprit: a golden bird. With the help of the titular Iron Wolf, Mishko begins a quest for the golden bird (that belongs to Tsar Poganin), a golden-maned horse and a golden-haired princess.
Latvia.
According to the Latvian Folktale Catalogue, tale type 550, "Bird, Horse, and Princess", is known in Latvia as "Zelta putns" ("Golden Bird"), comprising two different redactions. In its "first" redaction, the hero (the third prince) fetches the feather from the golden bird; a wolf devours his horse to regain its strength and promises to help the prince in a chain of quests for the golden bird, a golden colt and a princess.
Adaptations.
Russian Romantic writer Vasily Zhukovsky adapted the tale into verse form in his poem "Сказка о Иване-царевиче и Сером Волке" ("The Tale of Ivan Tsarevich and the Grey Wolf").
English author Alan Garner adapted the tale as "Grey Wolf, Prince Jack and the Firebird": the hero is renamed Prince Jack, who lives in the Stone Castle; the firebird lives in the Copper Kingdom, and the horse of the Golden Mane is found in the Iron Castle.
The WEBTOON comic, The Red King, by Heylenne is loosely based on this tale.

The Infinity

The Infinity or 300 Spear Street is a mixed-use residential condominium development in the Rincon Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California consisting of 2 high-rise towers and 2 low-rise buildings. The four buildings contain 650 residential units. The complex is the first phase of a massive residential development encompassing two city blocks.
History.
The two residential projects, 300 Spear and 201 Folsom, were proposed by Tishman Speyer Properties and initially designed by Heller Manus Architects. The San Francisco Planning Commission was scheduled to give its vote on the two projects on June 26, 2003, but this was delayed until September. Eventually, the two projects were given approval by the Planning Commission in spite of heavy opposition. However, 300 Spear and 201 Folsom still needed approval from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in order for the project to progress. A few months later, the Board of Supervisors gave initial approval to the projects. The project was given final approval by San Francisco's Board of Supervisors on February 4, 2004.
Description.
Overview.
The residential complex consists of four buildings with one 8 and one 9-story midrise, and 37 and 42-story highrise towers. The highrise towers are named The Infinity I and The Infinity II. One of the towers, the Infinity I, rises and contain 37 floors. The taller highrise, the Infinity II, rises and contain 42 floors. The 650-unit complex containing these four buildings is bounded by Main Street to the southwest, Folsom Street to the northwest and Spear Street to the northeast. The complex is one block inland from the Embarcadero and the San Francisco Bay. Pricing for the units range from $700,000-$5 million.
Design.
300 Spear was originally designed by San Francisco's Heller Manus Architects. The 820-unit complex featured a garden on top of the midrise towers and all four buildings were connected together. Later, the developer decided to hire Arquitectonica to revamp the design of 300 Spear along with Heller Manus Architects. The four buildings of the complex were split apart and the sky gardens were gone. In addition, the complex had its color changed to a blue-green color which adapted a simplified concrete structure with curving walls of glass curtain wall and metal. The number of units was also reduced from 820 to 650 before construction of 300 Spear began.
Impact.
The highrise towers rise above the earlier buildings in between the Embarcadero waterfront and Spear Street, making the complex prominent from places like the San Francisco Bay. Along with the Millennium Tower and One Rincon Hill to the west and south, respectively, they will create a new highrise neighborhood in the South of Market district.
Buried ship discovery.
Construction started in April, 2005 when a surface parking lot was demolished to make way for the complex. Midway through the excavation process, a buried ship was found just to the south of Spear Street below street level on fill that was once a ship breaking dock owned by Charles Haer. The buried ship was later identified as the 1818 whaling ship "The Candace".

Padstow Lifeboat Station

Padstow Lifeboat Station has been at Trevose Head west of Padstow, Cornwall, since 1967. Before that it was at Hawker's Cove on the Camel estuary between the town and the sea. The lifeboat station is run by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), and since 2006 has been the base for RNLB "Spirit of Padstow".
History.
The entrance to the River Camel is difficult to navigate because of the Doom Bar sandbank. This, and the steep cliffs and rocks along coast either side of the estuary, have been the site of many shipwrecks. In 1827 a small double-ended lifeboat was built by a local boat builder for £50, £10 of which was provided by the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (as the RNLI was known at the time) and the remainder from local people. The Padstow Harbour Association for the Preservation of Life and Property from Shipwreck was founded at a public meeting on 11 November 1829. Funding came from Lloyd's of London and several companies involved in shipping along the coast. Equipment was provided to help vessels enter and leave the estuary; Manby's mortars were provided to help crews escape shipwrecks, and a boathouse was built at Hawker's Cove for the lifeboat which was closer to the Doom Bar than the quay where it had previously been kept.
The Harbour Association's lifeboat was in poor condition by 1855 and so the RNLI undertook to provide a new one. It arrived at Padstow on 3 June 1856 and kept in the boathouse at Hawker's Cove. A larger lifeboat was provided in 1864 for which a new boathouse was built at Hawker's Cove next to the earlier one. The lifeboat capsized on 6 February 1867 while attempting to rescue the crew of a schooner, resulting in the deaths of five of the lifeboat crew.
The lifeboats were often taken overland to alternative launch sites, either because the weather prevented crossing the Doom Bar, or to be nearer to the ship to be aided. A carriage house was built in Trethillick Lane in 1883. When it was required, the carriage was taken from here to the harbour and the lifeboat rowed up from Hawker's Cove and loaded onto the carriage. Horses for the carriage were borrowed from farmers. 1899 saw a change in the way Padstow lifeboats were operated. The 'pulling and sailing' lifeboat continued to be kept in the boathouse, but a new lifeboat was moored in the estuary which could operate further from the station or in bad weather. Both lifeboats were lost on 11 April 1900 when they were called out to a fishing boat that had run aground. The smaller lifeboat was replaced by a similar boat, but the steam lifeboat was replaced by a steam tug and a larger 'pulling and sailing' lifeboat that usually worked as a pair.
A motor lifeboat replaced the steam tug and its lifeboat in May 1929, and a smaller motor lifeboat took up the Hawker's Cove station in 1931 where a new boathouse and slipway were built. The small lifeboat in the boathouse had always been known as 'Padstow No.1' and the larger one moored in the harbour was 'Padstow No.2', but in 1938 the numbers were reversed with the larger boat becoming 'Padstow No.1'. Hawker's Cove was closed on 31 March 1962 due to silting, the other lifeboat now working from the harbour on its own.
Silting around Hawker's Cove and the Doom Bar made it increasingly difficult to reach the sea, so a new boathouse was built at Trevose Head, on the coast to the west of Padstow. The lifeboat was launched down a roller slipway with an incline of 1 in 5½. It became operational on 23 October 1967 and Malcolm Arnold wrote the ‘Padstow Lifeboat March’ to mark the occasion. The boathouse at Trevose Head was replaced by a new one which was built alongside and opened on 17 July 2006. This had a slipway at an incline on 1 in 5. Meanwhile, in 1994, an inshore lifeboat station had been opened at to provide cover in the estuary and close inshore.
Lifeboat wrecks.
13 lifeboat crew have been killed in two separate incidents at Padstow.
On 6 February 1867 the RNLB "Albert Edward" went out to the schooner "Georgiana" which was caught in a gale while on its way from Rouen to Cork. Five of the lifeboat crew (Daniel Shea, William Intross, Thomas Varco, Andrew Truscott and Michael Crennel) drowned after it capsized. The five people on the "Georgiana" managed to get ashore after it ran aground and the lifeboat righted itself and was repaired. A memorial to the men who died was placed on the wall of Padstow church.
On 11 April 1900 the ketch "Peace and Plenty" of Lowestoft dragged her anchor in a gale. Five of the ketch's crew were rescued by the Trebetherick Rocket Brigade but three drowned. RNLB "Arab" was anchored by the ketch and running out the cable to get closer when a large wave hit the boat, swamping it and breaking 9 of its 10 oars. The crew managed to get the lifeboat ashore but it was wrecked. The steam lifeboat "James Stevens No. 4" was launched but capsized as it left the estuary. The four men in the engine room (John Martin, James Old, Joseph Stephens and Sydney East) were unable to escape and four of the deck crew (David Grubb, John Bate, James Grubb and Edward Kane) were also drowned. Memorials to 7 of the lost crew is in Padstow Cemetery but the other man is buried at St Merryn.
Awards.
28 silver and 2 bronze RNLI medals have been awarded for services in and around Padstow.
The first silver medal awarded at Padstow was to W Giles for his part in the rescue of 4 people from a ship that was aground on the Doom Bar on 29 November 1833. The Harbour Association's lifeboat capsized so Giles took another boat out with 7 volunteers. The Harbour Association's lifeboat succeeded in saving three men on 30 November 1836 after two vessels collided and ran aground. Mitchel Wade was awarded a silver medal for leading the rescue. Another silver medal was awarded to Coastguard Chief Officer Joseph Mortley for his part in using the rocket apparatus to rescue people from a ship aground on the Doom Bar on 31 March 1841. Boat builder Richard Tredwen was awarded a silver medal after leading the rescue of 7 from another boat which grounded on the Doom Bar on 28 October 1843. Three silver medals were awarded to William Johns, William Dark and William Found after saving 21 people from the "Marchioness of Abercorn" when it was wrecked on 8 December 1847 while on passage from Quebec to London.
Daniel Shea was awarded a silver medal for two rescues in one week in 1859. 7 people were saved from the "Gonsalve" of Nantes On 8 March 1859 and another 7 from the "Frederick William" of Ipswich on 15 March 1859. The Emperor of the French also awarded silver medals to all of the men involved in the rescue of the "Gonsalve". Daniel Shea was awarded a silver second-service clasp after entering the sea in an attempt to rescue the crew of a ship aground near Trevose Head on 22 January 1860. He was in the lifeboat again on 29 December 1865 and was awarded a silver third-service clasp. William Hills was in charge of the lifeboat on this occasion and was also awarded a silver medal; 17 men being saved from the "Juliet" of Greenock. William Hills was given a second-service clasp in 1870 for his 'long and gallant services' at Padstow.
Silver medals were awarded to Ellen Prideaux Brune, Gertrude Prideaux Brune, Mary Prideaux Brune, Beatrice Prideaux Brune and Nora O'Shaughnessy after they took the rowing boat they were in to rescue a sailor from a boat which capsized off Bray Hill on 9 August 1879. William Webb was given a silver medal in 1883 to mark his retirement after 13 years as lifeboat coxswain.
The first silver medal at Padstow in the twentieth century was awarded to William Baker for leading a double rescue on 12 November 1911. The RNLB "Arab" was launched because a schooner was seen to be in trouble. It ran aground on the Doom Bar and 6 people were taken off and landed. The lifeboat immediately put out again as a French ship was also known to be in trouble and it too struck the Doom Bar. The tired lifeboat crew were unable to reach the grounded vessel so returned to the station for fresh hands. With some new volunteers now on board, the "Arab" managed to rescue the ship's captain. William Baker also received a bronze medal for leading the rescue on 11 February 1928 of 18 men from the SS "Taormina" despite sea conditions making it difficult to get past the Doom Bar. On 27 November 1928 the RNLI's steam tug "Helen Peele" went out to search for a missing fishing boat. It was found near Port Quin where it was in danger of being running aground. The tug managed to get alongside and take off the 5 crew for which Joseph Atkinson was awarded a bronze medal.
William Orchard took the RLNB "Princess Mary" into heavy surf on 23 November 1944 to save 7 people from the steamer "Sjofna". He was awarded a silver medal for this along with the Maud Smith Award for the bravest act of life-saving by a lifeboatman that year. John Murt was given a silver medal for rescuing 10 from the "Kedah" on 12 August 1946 after 7 hours at sea in 'almost impossible conditions' during which the lifeboat was damaged.
The final medal service from Padstow Harbour was made on 23 November 1965. The RNLB "Joseph Hiram Chadwick" went to the aid of the fishing boat "Deo Gratias" after it lost its rudder in a storm. The silver medal was awarded to Gordon Elliott for rescuing its crew of 2.
The RNLB "James and Catherine Macfarlane" launched from Trevose Head late at night on 7 December 1975 when flares were seen. A storm was blowing and large waves broke across the lifeboat, smashing the windscreen and injuring several of the crew. A framed 'Certificate of Thanks inscribed on Vellum' was presented to the coxswain and crew. The lifeboat was launched on 17 July 1977 and saved 2 people and a dog from the yacht "Calcutta Princess". Anthony Warnock and Trevor England were awarded silver medals for this difficult rescue which was performed dangerously close to rocks at Dinas Head. The Padstow Lifeboat was one of many that were in service on 14 and 15 August 1979 when the yachts taking part in the Fastnet Race were overcome by an unexpected storm. The crew received a special framed certificate for their work in bringing several boats safely to harbour. A silver second-service clasp was awarded to Trevor England when the lifeboat attended the Greek cargo ship "Skopelos Sky" which was being blown ashore at Port Quinn in a force 10 storm on 15 December 1979. The 'Thanks of the Institution Inscribed on Vellum' was presented to all the crew members as is usual for a medal service, but this was extended to the shore crew who had the difficult task of rehousing the lifeboat when it returned to Trevose Head that evening when the storm was still making huge waves at the bottom of the slipway.
A 'Framed Letter of Thanks signed by the Chairman' was sent to the crew after the RNLB "James Burrough" stood by the cargo vessel "Secil Japan" which had grounded on rocks in Deadman's Cove on 12 March 1989. Heavy seas damaged the lifeboat and it was unable to be taken back into the boathouse until after daybreak. H Murt was awarded a British Empire Medal in 1988 as was Trevor England in 1992.
The RNLB "Spirit of Padstow" was launched at 11:08 on 25 June 2007. The "Coresande" had suffered damage in a storm. The yacht's crew were lifted off by helicopter and the lifeboat towed the vessel into Padstow harbour. Before it could be rehoused it was diverted to another small boat, the "Fly" which was aground near the Doom Bar. After this the sea conditions were too rough to return to Trevose Head so the crew moored in Padstow at 23:35. For this lengthy double service, Alan Tarby was presented with 'Thanks of the Institution Inscribed on Vellum' and Luke Chown and Christopher Murphy, who had gone aboard the "Coresande", were given 'Framed Letters of Thanks signed by the Chairman'. Alan Tarby received a Framed Letter of Thanks signed by the chairman for a service to a yacht on 29 April 2013.
Description.
The current lifeboat station was designed by Poynton Bradbury Wynter Cole with Haskoning UK acting as consulting engineers. The building work was contracted to John Martin Construction. Most of the materials arrived by sea and a jack-up barge was used as a work base. The boathouse is elevated above the sea; access from the cliff top is by the steps and hoist that were constructed for the 1967 boathouse. The lifeboat is kept on a tipping cradle so that it can be kept level for maintenance but launched down the 1 in 5, slipway. The boathouse has a C-shaped profile for the copper exterior which is built on a timber frame. Construction cost £6,829,900.
Padstow lifeboats.
'ON' is the Official Number used in RNLI records from 1884. 'Op.No.' is the Operational Number of the boat carried on the boat.
Hawker's Cove Station.
Boat kept in a boathouse and launched across the beach. Known as Padstow No. 1 station from 1899 to 1938, then Padstow No. 2 station from 1938 to 1962.
Padstow Harbour.
Boat kept afloat on moorings. Known as Padstow No. 2 station from 1899 to 1938, then Padstow No. 1 station from 1938 to 1962.

Texla, Texas

Texla is a ghost town in northern Orange County, Texas, United States, in the southeastern part of the state. It is located northwest of Orange, just west of Mauriceville. The site was originally called "Bruce", after the postmaster Charles G. Bruce, who served when the office opened in 1905. The first sawmill to operate there was known as the "Harrell-Votaw Lumber Company" with proximity to the Orange and Northwestern Railway. The following year, the "R. W. Wier Lumber Company" out of Houston took over operations. The site (and the post office) was renamed "Texla", due to its proximity to Louisiana. The owner Wier sold out to the "Miller-Link Lumber Company" in 1917. The peak population of the town reached an estimated 600 residents. In 1918 the mill was destroyed by fire, but was rebuilt in 1919 with a double-circular mill of the same size. Within a year, the "Peavy-Moore Lumber Company" of Deweyville took ownership, and operated the site until the nearby timber became exhausted. In 1929, the mill was dismantled and the site was abandoned.&lt;br&gt; From 1945 until 1977, a sawmill operated under the name "Texla Lumber Company" in nearby Mauriceville, according to the Texas Forestry Museum.

Hangman's House

Hangman's House is a 1928 American romantic drama genre silent film set in County Wicklow, Ireland, directed by John Ford (uncredited) with inter-titles written by Malcolm Stuart Boylan. It is based on a novel by Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne. It was adapted by Philip Klein with scenarios by Marion Orth. The film is also notable for containing the first confirmed appearance by John Wayne in a John Ford film.
Plot.
While stationed in Algiers, Commandant Denis Hogan receives a letter containing bad news and requests leave to return to his home country of Ireland, where he is a wanted man. In Ireland, Baron James O'Brien is told by his doctor that he has no more than a month to live. He decides to marry off his only daughter Connaught to a socialite, John D'Arcy, despite her love of childhood friend Dermot McDermot.
Hogan returns to Ireland and disguises himself as a holy man. On his way to the O'Brien's house he is recognised by a gatekeeper, to whom he reveal his intention to kill a man. Hogan meets Dermot McDermot and the three men witness the lights of Glenmalure's chapel being lit, signifying a wedding is taking place. Later that night, after Connaught and D'Arcy have been wed, the Baron dies. On the night of his funeral Hogan sneaks about the grounds of Hangman's House and is spotted by D'Arcy. D'Arcy tries to sleep with Connaught but she rejects his advances.
A community race is held on Saint Stephen's Day and Connaught's horse, The Bard, is due to race. The horse's jockey goes missing just before the race because of interference from D'Arcy, who has bet against the horse. Dermot is required to jockey the horse and he wins the race, leading a drunken D'Arcy to shoot The Bard. D'Arcy is ostracised by the community because of this. Hogan is arrested at the race. At night Dermot and D'Arcy meet in a pub where D'Arcy reveals that he had an affair with Hogan's sister. Dermot gives D'Arcy money to leave Ireland and threatens that if he ever sees him again, he will kill him.
Hogan escapes from prison and a gunfight erupts between his men and the guards. Dermot and Connaught visit Hogan's hideout and Hogan reveals that his sister died following D'Arcy's desertion. Connaught returns to Hangman's House to discover that D'Arcy has returned. After a struggle she flees to Dermot's house. Hogan and Dermot go to Hangman's House and confront D'Arcy. During a fight between the men a fire breaks out and burns down the house. Hogan and Dermot escape but D'Arcy falls to his death as a balcony collapses. Connaught and Dermot see Hogan off at the port as he returns to Algiers. Connaught and Dermot depart together as Hogan watches.

Plot.
In the shadowy basements of Petrograd, amid flickering candlelight and whispered fervor, a revolutionary cell gathers. Among them is Lya (Lya De Putti), a fiery, flirtatious peasant girl whose devotion to the cause is thinly veiled beneath her true passions: beauty, power, and fine things. She is the sweetheart of Zaneriff (Warner Oland), a hardened revolutionary and one of the Red movement’s most zealous leaders. But while Zaneriff rants of liberty and overthrowing the Czarist regime, Lya's gaze drifts toward jewels, silks—and her own advantage.
Their clandestine meeting is abruptly shattered when a Cossack patrol, led by the iron-jawed Captain (Hans Joby), storms the hideout. Gunfire and confusion follow. Lya narrowly escapes out a window, fleeing blindly into the night—until she stumbles, by fate or chance, onto the snow-dusted estate of Prince Nicholas Korloff (Don Alvarado), a nobleman recently recalled from the front to fulfill his duty to the Crown through a diplomatic marriage.
When the Captain arrives to inform Nicholas that a fugitive revolutionist is hiding nearby, the Prince, with easy aristocratic dismissal, laughs off the suggestion. That is, until he returns to his chambers and finds Lya—drenched, disheveled, and defiant—hiding under his bed. Amused by the wild-eyed girl who begs for his protection from a Siberian death, Nicholas agrees to shield her—for now.
Days pass. The rebel girl, awed by the opulence of the palace and charmed by the Prince, stays on. She appoints herself an unofficial mistress of the house, directing servants and injecting her bold personality into the rigid corridors of nobility. Nicholas, captivated despite himself, allows her impertinence—until her impulsive tongue insults his royal fiancée. Infuriated, he orders Lya to leave.
But Lya, torn between rebellion and romantic yearning, refuses to go. Just as she clings to hope that Nicholas may relent, Zaneriff infiltrates the palace to retrieve her. He urges Lya to return to the cause, but she hesitates. Before she can choose, the Cossacks return to search the estate. Lya hides once more in Nicholas’s chambers—again under the bed.
This time, however, the Prince is no longer amused. He realizes, with quiet intensity, that he has fallen in love with the passionate girl who has upended his life.
For a time, their union blooms, unburdened by politics or position. But their happiness is short-lived. The Prince’s ever-watchful valet (Otto Matieson), driven by duty and perhaps jealousy, reveals Lya’s revolutionary ties—and worse, that she came to Nicholas straight from Zaneriff’s arms. Nicholas, stung by betrayal, turns on her. Lya responds with proud rage, wishing aloud for the fall of the aristocracy and vowing vengeance if he ever falls into her hands.
Her words become prophecy. The revolution erupts into full force. Zaneriff and his Red Guard overrun the palace. Now fully committed to the cause—and consumed by heartbreak—Lya becomes the infamous “Scarlet Lady”, the most feared figure among the Reds. She declares that her mission is not complete until Prince Nicholas himself is brought before her in chains.
Meanwhile, Nicholas uses his last bribes to send his noble bride to safety and returns to his palace in disguise. Lya finds him there—disheveled, humbled, reduced to a servant’s role. She mocks him cruelly, assigning him humiliating tasks. Yet her cruelty is a mask for pain; she still loves him. Her torment becomes unbearable, and she confesses her regret.
But Zaneriff is watching. He learns that Lya has been protecting the Prince and orders her to deliver Nicholas to the firing squad. She pretends to obey, planning instead an escape. Yet before they can flee, Nicholas is seized and thrown into the “cellar of horrors”, where the last of the Royalists await execution beside open graves they themselves have dug.
Zaneriff, gloating, prepares to take the final shot. He saves Nicholas for last, a final trophy in the collapse of the aristocracy.
In one final, desperate gambit, Zaneriff turns to Lya and mockingly asks if she has any last words for the condemned Prince. Her answer is chilling but calm:
“Yes… if you’ll be so kind as to hand me your revolver, I’ll deliver my reply in lead.”
Amused, Zaneriff hands over the gun, taunting her to do it. But Lya does not aim at Nicholas—she turns the weapon on Zaneriff, shooting him point blank. He collapses, dying, into the very grave Nicholas was forced to dig.
In the confusion, Lya throws Zaneriff’s cloak and cap over Nicholas, and the two lovers flee the palace as the Red Guard reels from the death of their leader.

Ramdas Athawale

Dr Ramdas Bandu Athawale (; born 25 December 1959) is an Indian politician, social activist and trade unionist from Maharashtra. He is the president since 1999 of the Republican Party of India (A), a splinter group of the Republican Party of India, which has its roots in the Scheduled Castes Federation led by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. Currently, he is the Minister of State in the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India since 2016 and represents Maharashtra in Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India's Parliament since 2014. Previously, he was Lok Sabha MP from Pandharpur from 1999 to 2009 and from Mumbai North Central Lok Sabha constituency from 1998 to 1999. He was also Cabinet minister of Maharashtra from 1990 to 1995 and a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Council from 1990 to 1996.
Early life.
Athawale was born on 25 December 1959 in Agalgaon, Sangli district, Bombay State, which is now Maharashtra. His parents were Bandu Bapu and Honsabai Bandu Athawale. He attended Siddharth College of Law, Mumbai and married to Seema Athawale, on 16 May 1992. He has a son. Ramdas Athawale is a practitioner of Buddhism.
Athawale has been editor of a weekly magazine called "Bhumika" and is a founder member of Parivartan Sahitya Mahamandal. He has served as president of Parivartan Kala Mahasangha, the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Foundation and the Bauddha Kalawant Academy (Buddhist Artists Academy) and was founder president of Bauddha Dhamma Parishad (Buddhism conference). He played the title role in a Marathi film, "Anyayacha Pratikar", and also had a small role in another Marathi film, "Joshi ki Kamble", as well as roles in Marathi dramas such as "Ekach Pyala".
Political career.
Athwale was inspired by B. R. Ambedkar, the Indian polymath. Following a split in the Dalit Panther movement in 1974, Athawale joined Arun Kamble and Gangadhar Gade in leading a rump in Maharashtra. His involvement with a faction of the Republican Party of India, despite the Panther's general disdain for its leadership, eventually led to an association with the Indian National Congress (INC).
Athawale was member of Maharashtra Legislative Council from 1990 to 1996 and was Cabinet Minister for Social Welfare and Transport, Employment Guarantee Scheme and Prohibition Propaganda in the Government of Maharashtra between 1990 and 1995.
He represented the Pandharpur constituency of Maharashtra and is the president of the Republican Party of India (Athawale) (RPIA).
Athawale represented Mumbai North Central in the 12th Lok Sabha during 1998-99 and was elected to serve a second term in the 13th Lok Sabha of 1999–2004. A third term, in the 14th Lok Sabha, followed from 2004 to 2009. Considered something of a lightweight in state politics, he has been courted at various times by various parties because of a perception that he might assist in mobilising the scattered Maharashtrian Dalit vote in their favour. He left the Nationalist Congress Party-INC alliance in 2011 after having lost in the 2009 Lok Sabha election, when he contested the reserved Shirdi constituency. This defeat was despite a subsequent report by Social Watch which ranked him as the second-best performing member of the 14th Lok Sabha, based on an analysis of various data points. Athawale led the RPI party, joined the alliance of Shivsena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2011 and contested Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections together.
In 2014, Athawale was elected to the Rajya Sabha, which is the upper house of parliament. He became Minister of State in the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment on 6 July 2016, working under Thawar Chand Gehlot.
His RPI(A) organisation is a part of the National Democratic Alliance led by the BJP.
Devyani Khobragade was proposed for the role of Personal Secretary to Athawale in July 2016 but the appointment was refused by Gehlot, who saw a conflict of interest because her father, Uttam Khobragade, was the national executive president of the RPI(A).
When Athawale established a children's wing of the RPI(A) in September 2017, he appointed his son, then aged 12, to be its leader.
In May 2019, Athawale continued his position as Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment.
In March 2020, a video of Athawale chanting 'Go Corona!' at a rally went viral and became a popular meme.
During a 3-day tour of Bihar, on 29 March 2025, Athawale asserted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will "break the record of Jawahar Lal Nehru" and retain power for the fourth consecutive term.
Social activism.
In 2015, following attacks on Dalits in the state of Haryana, Athawale said that if the police were to continue turning a blind eye to their plight then special protection squads led by senior police officers should be formed from among members of the community and they should be granted firearms licenses so that they could protect themselves. In December 2017, he suggested that Dalits should renounce Hinduism in favour of Buddhism in order to stop being subject to "atrocities". He also criticised the record of the Hindu-centric BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in dealing with issues relating to discrimination of not only Dalits but also other disadvantaged communities in India. In March 2018, echoing remarks he had made soon after becoming Minister of State in 2016 and reacting in particular to recent atrocities against Dalits in Saharanpur, Unnao and Allahabad, Athawale advocated inter-caste marriage as the best way to minimise such events and noted that he had married a Brahmin "to set an example". As he had done in December 2017, he attacked Mayawati, a Dalit former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, on this occasion for what he perceived as a lack of action to help Dalits during her four terms in office. He said that this had caused the community to shift their support to the BJP and RPI, while refuting charges that he was a puppet under BJP control.
Although described as a Dalit leader, Athawale has caused controversy among Dalits. In January 2018, around 130 people were arrested when some Dalit activists protested against him during a speech.
Aside from his involvement in Dalit affairs, Athawale has also advocated reservation for economically disadvantaged upper caste communities. He has said that the government of India should release the caste-based information collected during the 2011 Census of India, which is considered to be a politically sensitive dataset, in order to address inequities in the reservation system across the board. He rejects claims that doing so would lead to an increase in casteism.
Athawale has said that reservation quota of 25 percent for Dalits should be introduced to sports, including cricket, following India's defeat in the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy Final against Pakistan, and that the armed forces should also be subject to a quota regime. He has also said that, just as the Lok Sabha has constituencies reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, so too should the Rajya Sabha and the Union cabinet. In addition, he favours increasing the prevailing 50 per cent quota that exists for government jobs and places at educational institutions to 75 per cent, stressing that this would apply to all castes that are recognised as economically disadvantaged, which includes those categorised at Other Backwards Classes.
On April 28, 2025, following the Pahalgam attack and the 2025 India-Pakistan border skirmishes and diplomatic crisis, he stated that India should declare war against Pakistan if the country refuses to surrender Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Jon McGregor

Jon McGregor (born 1976) is a British novelist and short story writer. In 2002, his first novel was longlisted for the Booker Prize, making him then the youngest-ever contender. His second and fourth novels were longlisted for the Booker Prize in 2006 and 2017 respectively. In 2012, his third novel, "Even the Dogs", was awarded the International Dublin Literary Award. "The New York Times" has labelled him a "wicked British writer".
Early life.
Born in Bermuda, McGregor was raised in the UK. He grew up in Norwich and Thetford, Norfolk. He attended City College Norwich sixth form and then studied for a degree in Media Technology and Production at Bradford University. In his final year there he contributed a series entitled "Cinema 100" to the anthology "Five Uneasy Pieces" (Pulp Faction).
Career.
Having moved to Nottingham (where he now lives), he wrote his first novel, "If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things", while living on a narrowboat. It was nominated for the 2002 Booker Prize, making its author the youngest contender and only first novelist on the longlist. McGregor was only 26 at the time.
"If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things" went on to win the Betty Trask Prize and the Somerset Maugham Award, among other honours. His novel "So Many Ways to Begin", published in 2006, also found its way onto the Booker Prize longlist. McGregor was commissioned to write a short story, which was called "Close", for the Cheltenham Literature Festival in 2007. McGregor has had short fiction published by several magazines, including "Granta" magazine.

McGregor received a prize of €100,000. The prize's judging panel, which included the British novelist Tim Parks and the Trinidadian writer Elizabeth Nunez, described "Even the Dogs", a novel detailing the highs and lows of drug addiction, as a "fearless experiment". McGregor described it as "a real honour to have been selected from such a huge list of fantastic works from around the world." He was the first British writer to win the award since Nicola Barker in 2000.

Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ

Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ was a Japanese music variety show on Fuji Television hosted by the comedy duo Downtown, which consists of Hitoshi Matsumoto and Masatoshi Hamada. It is a very popular show with comical hosts who like to pick on their guests. An episode usually consists of live performances (of recently released songs) from popular artists, chat segments and other fun and games.
Many famous singers such as Ayumi Hamasaki, Britney Spears, Hikaru Utada, and Namie Amuro have performed almost all of their singles on this show. Japanese rock artists such as Glay, X Japan, Alice Nine, The Gazette, Nightmare, Gackt, DJ Ozma, and L'Arc-en-Ciel have also been on the show performing their hit singles as well as playing games with the hosts. All bands signed under Johnny &amp; Associates have also appeared on the show as guests and have performed their latest hit songs. South Korean boybands SS501, Big Bang, TVXQ and girl groups S.E.S., Girls' Generation, and Kara have also appeared on the show.
On September 18, 2012, Fuji TV announced that "Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ" would end its run after eighteen years. The series finale aired on December 17, 2012.
Segments.
Music mixture.
In this quiz game segment, four or five teams of one or more individuals try to guess songs as they are played four at a time. (As each song is correctly guessed, they are eliminated from the mixture.) Each song has a descending point value, from 40 for the first song guessed to 10 for the last.
The game is played in four rounds, with the final round determining the winner in one of two ways through a random draw. The "NG" variation has one of the four songs in the final rounds taking away 100 points from the individual/team who guessed it. The "Lucky" variation is exactly the reverse: one of the final round songs "gives" 100 points to the individual/team who guessed it.
Telephone box.
In this interview segment, guests are interviewed over a telephone in an English-style phone box.
Rainichi-In.
This interview segment focuses on non-Japanese artists that have a loyal following in Japan, such as Ne-Yo and Britney Spears.
Hoshi no resutoran (The Star restaurant).
This segment is a combination interview/cooking show: a chef from a restaurant selected by the guest(s) as his/her/their favorite restaurant cooks for that guest and Downtown.
One notable example of this is when X Japan co-founder Yoshiki noted the Shibuya-based restaurant "La Rochelle" as his favorite place.
The restaurant's owner/head chef, Hiroyuki Sakai, came on the show to cook a special dish for Yoshiki.
Other competitions.
Miscellaneous competition segments have also occurred over the show's run, many of which started rivalries between Downtown and guests. One such example is a 1999 billiards competition between entertainer Masaharu Fukuyama and Hitoshi Matsumoto, which led to an "Iron Chef" battle between the two.

Giovanni Antonio Dosio

Giovanni Antonio Dosio (1533–1611) was an Italian architect and sculptor.
Biography.
Dosio was born in San Gimignano. A student of Ammanati, with whom he realized the Villa dell'Ambrogiana, Dosio worked primarily in Rome (1548–75) and Florence (1575–89), with some commissions that took him to Naples.
During his early years in Rome, where he arrived at the age of fifteen, Dosio produced numerous drawings of the ancient and modern city, and developed a reputation as an antiquary while he was still a young man. He worked in the atelier of Raffaello da Montelupo until 1551. His first important Roman commission was the tomb for his friend, the humanist poet Annibale Caro, in 1567; in the interim, he scratched out a miserable living doing restorations of fragments of Roman sculpture. In 1562 he was carrying out an excavation on behalf of the papal "condottiere" Torquato Conti, who had extensive contacts among humanist and antiquarian circles in Rome and knew Dosio's good friend Annibale Caro. Dosio was uncovering the fragments of the marble map of Rome made for Septimius Severus, the "Forma Urbis Romae" from a site near the Church of SS Cosma e Damiano. Torquato Conti had leased the excavation site from the canons of the church. Conti presented the precious fragments to his relative Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. Conti then sent Dosio to his castello at Poli, where Dosio executed the stucco friezes that may still be seen there in the ground-floor apartments.
In 1564 a papal courier found Dosio in the Umbrian hilltown of Amelia, working on a funeral monument for a local bishop, Bartolomeo Farrattino. Immediately thereafter Dosio left to oversee the rebuilding of fortifications at Anagni, his first work as an architect, which was interrupted in 1565 with the death of Pope Pius IV; of this work, two of the rusticated portals remain, the Porta S. Maria, and the Porta S. Francesco. The overall design of the fortifications was doubtless due to Pius's cousin, Gabrio Serbelloni, and the military governor, Torquato Conti, to whom Dosio owed the commission.
His years in Florence are best known in part because his sole contemporary biographer, Raffaello Borghini, was Florentine himself, and described Dosio's work in Florence most fully. His Florentine years coincided with his full maturity as an architect, and the commissions were for projects that were grander than his Roman work.
He was the author of "Urbis aedificiorum illustrium quae supersunt reliquiae" (1569). Giovanni Battista Caccini was his pupil.
His place in the history of the period, according to modern art scholar Carolyn Valone (1976) is of the "second rank".
From 1590 he worked for almost twenty years in Naples, where the Viceroy bestowed on him the prestigious appointment of “royal architect”. In Naples he realized the cloister of the San Martino Charterhouse, worked on a draft for the Girolamini church, while in the Cathedral of Naples he realized the Brancaccio Chapel (1598). From 1600 He worked in Caserta for the Prince of Caserta Andrea Matteo Acquaviva D’Aragona. He died in Caserta.

Nashenas

Dr. Mohammad Sadiq Fitrat, born Sadiq Fitrat Habibi (Pashto/Dari: ), known professionally as Nashenas (), is one of the oldest surviving musicians from Afghanistan. His fame began in the late 1950s, and since then he has produced many albums consisting of Pashto, Persian, and Urdu songs. He is known as "the Afghan Saigal".
Background and early life.
Nashenas was born in Kandahar, Afghanistan to an ethnic Pashtun family. He belongs to the famous Habibi family who are Kakar by tribe. This is a religious family which descends from Habibullah Kakar, or Habibullah Akhundzada. His primary education was in Kandahar.
After his father was appointed by the National Bank of Karachi, he moved to British India where he lived without his mother. He encountered classical Indian music, which deeply moved and influenced him. Zakir Husain taught him calligraphy, Persian and Urdu.
While staying in Chaman, near the border of Afghanistan, he went to a school where he experienced an important moment in his musical awakening. Students were celebrating the establishment of their school. Kids used tables as drums while Nashenas sang. He was called to the principal's office. Thinking that he would get punished, he decided to deny that he was singing. On the contrary, he found that school appreciated his talents and encouraged him to perform. He received a medal and five volumes of religious texts.
Career.
In 1948 he returned to Afghanistan. Starting from 1953 he begins to sing on Afghan radio and becomes known under his pseudonym "Nashenas", which translates to "unknown". He used this pseudonym initially to hide his real identity. His family stressed to him the importance of religion as he hailed from the religious elite of the city of Kandahar, but according to Nashenas himself, his parents covertly approved and were proud of his singing talent.
In the early 1970s, Nashenas traveled to the Soviet Union where he obtained his doctorate in Pashto Literature from Moscow State University.
Since the early 1990s, he lives in London, England. He has never returned to Afghanistan since then.
Nashenas continues to be still popular in Afghanistan, including in the Pashto-speaking areas of Pakistan. He also wrote a song written by Muhammad Iqbal.
 Nashenas has a following among musicians of the new generation as well, who are noted to imitate his style of singing. One of which is Sardar Ali Takkar, a Pashtun musician from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.
In October 2023, Nashenas at the age of 88 made his first public performance in two decades at a venue in Beverwijk, the Netherlands.

Church of the Light

The Church of the Light (sometimes called the "Church with Light") is the main chapel of the Ibaraki Kasugaoka Church, a member church of the United Church of Christ in Japan. It was built in 1989, in the city of Ibaraki, Osaka Prefecture.
This building is one of the most famous designs of Japanese architect Tadao Ando.
In 1999, the main building was extended with the addition of a Sunday School.
Construction and structure.
The Church of the Light is a small structure on the corner of two streets at Ibaraki, a residential neighborhood. It is located 25 km north-northeast of Osaka in the western foothills of the Yodo valley railway corridor. The church has an area of roughly 113 m2 (1216 ft2): about the same size as a small house.
The church was planned as an add-on to the wooden chapel and minister's house that already existed at the site. The Church of the Light consists of three 5.9m concrete cubes (5.9 m wide × 17.7 m long × 5.9 m high) penetrated by a wall angled at 15°, dividing the cube into the chapel and the entrance area. One indirectly enters the church by slipping between the two volumes, one that contains the Sunday school and the other that contains the worship hall. The benches, along with the floor boards, are made of re-purposed scaffolding used in the construction. A cruciform is cut into the concrete behind the altar, and lit during the day.
Work was delayed due to problems in raising the necessary funds. Initially it was feared that it would cost more than the budget and Ando even considered building it without a roof, but the construction firm donated the roof and this became unnecessary.
Design themes.
Tadao Ando often uses Zen philosophies when conceptualizing his structures. One theme he expresses in this work is the dual nature of existence. The space of the chapel is defined by light, the strong contrast between light and solid. In the chapel light enters from behind the altar from a cross cut in the concrete wall that extends vertically from floor to ceiling and horizontally from wall to wall, aligning perfectly with the joints in the concrete. At this intersection of light and solid the occupant is meant to become aware of the deep division between the spiritual and the secular within themselves.
One feature of the interior is its profound emptiness. Many who enter the church say they find it disturbing. The distinct void space and absolute quiet amounts to a sense of serenity. For Ando the idea of 'emptiness' means something different. It is meant to transfer someone into the realm of the spiritual. The emptiness is meant to invade the occupant so there is room for the spiritual to fill them.
Ando and his walls.
The one element carried through Tadao Ando's structures is his idolization of the reinforced concrete wall. The importance given to walls is a distinct departure from Modernist architecture. They are usually made of 'in-situ' poured in place concrete. Considerable care is taken to see that the walls are as perfect as technique will allow. These walls are thick, solid, massive, and permanent. The main reinforced concrete shell of the Church of the Light is thick.
Ando has explained his thinking behind the design of the structure in a work co-written with Philip Drew:
Drew has expanded on the construction techniques:

Rickmansworth (Church Street) railway station

Rickmansworth (Church Street) railway station was a London and North Western Railway (LNWR) station in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, UK. Opened in 1862, it was the terminus of a branch line which used to run from Watford. The station closed to passengers in 1952, although the line continued to be used as a goods line until 1967. Church Street station has since been demolished. Rickmansworth station is about northwest of the site of Church Street station. Opening on 1 September 1887, it continues to serve both the London Underground Metropolitan line and Chiltern Railways between and via .
Church Street station was the terminus of the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway (W&amp;RR), a business venture of the Whig politician, Robert Grosvenor, 1st Baron Ebury (1801–1893). It opened on 1 October 1862. The line ran from Watford Junction to with many small freight branches, the most notable of which ran to Croxley Green.
Lord Ebury's plan was to extend the line south and to open a new railway to on the Great Western Railway's Uxbridge branch. However, the GWR withdrew its funding for the scheme and line was never extended. The line failed to operate at a profit, the W&amp;RR ran into financial difficulties, and eventually the operation was taken over by the London and North Western Railway in 1881.
In 1923, under the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), the Rickmansworth line and the service from Watford Junction to London Euston was converted to fourth-rail electric trains. The station was renamed Rickmansworth (Church Street) on 25 September 1950. It continued to be operated as a branch line from Watford by British Railways until the passenger service was withdrawn on 3 March 1952.
The station and tracks continued to be used for goods services until the line was cut back to one of the intermediate freight sidings.
The track to Watford High Street has since been removed and the trackbed is now the Ebury Way rail trail. The platforms and station buildings have been demolished; the site is now occupied by social housing. A new hotel now stands between the old station site and the canal.

Jeff Yass

Jeffrey Steven Yass (born July 1958) is an American billionaire businessman. According to "Forbes", Yass has a net worth of US$59 billion as of May 2025 up from $27.6 billion in April 2024. The richest man in Pennsylvania, he is also the 25th wealthiest person in the world. He is a registered Libertarian who gives money to conservative super-PACs including Club for Growth Action and the Protect Freedom Political Action Committee. He and his wife Janine Yass are supporters of school choice, a cause to which they have donated tens of millions of dollars.
He is the co-founder and managing director of the Philadelphia-based trading and technology firm Susquehanna International Group (SIG) and a major investor in TikTok. After Yass and U.S President Trump met in March 2024, Trump went from supporting a ban on TikTok to opposing a ban. In 2002, Yass joined the executive advisory council of the Cato Institute and now is a member of the executive advisory council. He donated approximately $100M during the 2024 US election cycle to Republican groups and campaigns. 
Early life.
Yass was born in 1958 in Queens, New York City, and grew up there in a middle-class Jewish family. He is the son of Gerald Yass and Gerald's "childhood sweetheart" Sybil. He has a sister, Carole.
Sybil Yass died in December 2001. Gerald Yass died on January 6, 2024, aged 94, in Boca Raton, Florida.
Yass attended public schools in Queens, graduating from Bayside High School in 1975. He earned a B.S. in mathematics and economics from Binghamton University. He pursued graduate studies in economics at New York University, but did not graduate.
Career.
While at the State University of New York at Binghamton in the 1970s, Yass and five fellow students became friends and in 1987 co-founded Susquehanna International Group (SIG), the largest trader of liquid stocks in the US. In the 1970s and early 1980s, before establishing his trading firm, Yass was a professional gambler, winning sums from poker and horse betting.
Billionaire trader Israel Englander sponsored Yass for a seat on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, and SIG was initially run from an office at the Exchange. His father, Gerald Yass, played an integral role in founding the company, contributing his expertise as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and helping to build SIG’s back-office bookkeeping operations. Gerald remained actively involved with the firm for decades, providing crucial support to its early infrastructure. As of 2021, SIG generates almost one-tenth of the market making trade volume in exchange-traded funds.
Political activities.
US federal and state contributions.
Yass has contributed significant sums to political efforts. In 2015, Yass donated $2.3 million to a super PAC supporting Rand Paul's presidential candidacy. He and his wife contributed just over $5 million in 2016. In 2018 he donated $3.8 million to the Club for Growth, and $20.7 million in 2020. In the 2020 election cycle, Yass was one of the ten largest political donors in the United States donating $25.3 million, all to Republican candidates including 47 lawmakers who sought to overturn the 2020 US presidential election. During the 2022 primary elections, Yass spent at least $18 million, including contributions in support of Republican Bill McSwain, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for governor of Pennsylvania. 
While primarily donating to Republicans, he also donated $1 million to the "Moderate PAC" which was set up to support Democratic incumbents against progressive primary challengers during the 2024 election cycle. He donated approximately $100M during the 2024 US election cycle to Republican groups and campaigns, including $6 million in political contributions via the "Commonwealth Leaders Fund" PAC, supporting Republican Dave Sunday over Democrat Eugene DePasquale in the 2024 Pennsylvania Attorney General election.
In the first half of 2025, Yass donated $16 million to MAGA Inc., a super PAC that supports Donald Trump, with Yass's donation being the highest record donation during that period.
Foreign contributions.
In March 2021, the Israeli newspaper "Haaretz" reported that Jeff Yass and Arthur Dantchik were behind a large portion of the donations to the Kohelet Policy Forum, whose worldview is based on nationalism, authoritarian government, low taxes and market freedom. The Kohelet Policy Forum is responsible for the 2023 Israeli judicial reform proposal. 
Also according to "Haaretz", Yass is a major supporter of Israeli right-wing think tanks. In April 2024, The Guardian reported that Jeff Yass donated $16 million to anti-Muslim and pro-Israel groups.
School choice.
Yass and his wife strongly support school choice, with Janine Yass writing a 2017 opinion piece for "The Washington Examiner" in support of then-incoming Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos's views at school choice and the couple writing an op-ed in The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2023 advocating for parental school choice in Pennsylvania. In November 2021, he donated $5 million to the School Freedom Fund, a PAC that runs ads for Republican candidates running in the 2022 election cycle nationwide. From 2010 to 2022, Yass contributed $41.7 million to Students First political action committee; Yass co-founded the PAC, which supports the school choice movement.
TikTok.
In September 2023, "The Wall Street Journal" reported that Yass, an investor in TikTok's parent firm ByteDance, is a major donor to US politicians who have opposed restrictions on TikTok. After Yass and Trump met in March 2024 at a Club for Growth event, Trump went from supporting a ban on TikTok to opposing a ban. At the same time Yass's SIG bought a substantial share in Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC), which it had been acquiring since 2021, providing Trump with a massive influx of money at a time when he faced mounting legal expenses. DWAC merged in 2024 with Trump Media, the company that launched Truth Social in 2022. A subsequent article by The Philadelphia Inquirer explained that as a market-maker, SIG also shorted the stock, per common market-maker practice, and did not hold an economic position in Trump Media but profited by managing trades in shares and derivatives. According to SIG filings with the SEC, the company sold its shares and liquidated the shorts after the merged company began trading as Trump Media.
Wealth and taxes.
Yass was the richest resident of Pennsylvania 2022-2025.
In 2022, an investigation by ProPublica, based on a review of tax returns it obtained, court documents, and securities filings, found that Yass engaged in tax avoidance, through Susquehanna trading strategies that "push legal boundaries" to reduce tax liability. ProPublica estimated "that if Yass' tax returns had resembled those of his competitors" (specifically, Ken Griffin, John Overdeck, and David Siegel), Yass "would have paid $1 billion more in federal income taxes" during the period 2013 to 2018.
Recognition.
In 2001, Yass appeared as one of "76 Revolutionary Minds" in "Philadelphia" magazine.
Personal life.
Yass is married to Janine Coslett. They have lived in Haverford in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania, for some years. They have four children, two sons and two daughters.
Philanthropy.
In December 2001, following the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, he announced a donation to the charitable fund established by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to assist the victims. He has supported Save the Children, "Spirit of Golf Foundation", People's Emergency Center "Families First" building, and the Franklin Institute's "Franklin Family Funfest Committee."
Jeff and Janine Yass founded the Yass Prize for Sustainable, Transformational, Outstanding, and Permissionless (STOP) education, which was launched during the COVID-19 pandemic. This initiative aims to recognize and support innovative, non-traditional education models. In 2022, the Yass Prize awarded over $20 million, including a $1 million grand prize to the Arizona Autism Charter Schools for their individualized learning programs.

Danco Laboratories

Danco Laboratories is a pharmaceutical distributor located in midtown Manhattan which distributes the abortifacient drug mifepristone under the brand name Mifeprex. Mifeprex is the only drug distributed by Danco, although the company plans to expand to other drugs in the future.
Danco is a private company that does not disclose the names of its investors, but stated that "[Investors] included wealthy individuals and foundations that supported abortion rights."
Outside the United States, mifepristone is distributed by the French pharmaceutical company Exelgyn, under the trade name Mifegyne.
History.
On 16 May 1994, Roussel-Uclaf announced it was donating without remuneration all rights for medical uses of mifepristone in the United States to the Population Council, which would then sponsor clinical trials for mifepristone between September 1994 and September 1995. In September 1995, The Population Council licensed mifepristone to Danco Laboratories and entered into a manufacturing agreement with Hungarian drug manufacturer Gedeon Richter. In 1996, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conditionally licensed RU-486 for early trimester abortion, pending a resolution on some remaining technical and manufacturing issues. 
In 1997, Gideon Richter withdrew from efforts to manufacture mifepristone in the United States following opposition from pro-life groups, which led to Danco filing a breach of contract lawsuit. 
On September 28, 2000, Danco Laboratories received approval to distribute mifepristone (under the Mifeprex brand name) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Danco had exclusive sales rights in the United States until 2019, when GenBioPro obtained approval to sell a generic version of mifepristone.

David Stockdale

David Adam Stockdale (born 20 September 1985) is an English football manager and former professional player who is manager of club Farsley Celtic.
A goalkeeper, Stockdale started his career with the Huddersfield Town youth system before joining York City's youth system in 2000, where he became a trainee in 2002. He made his first-team debut on the last day of the 2002–03 season. He established himself in the team during 2004–05 and in 2006, following loan spells at Wakefield-Emley and Worksop Town, was released by the club. He moved to Darlington and in his second season with the club played in the play-offs. He signed for Premier League club Fulham for an undisclosed fee in 2008, but never became a regular, and spent several spells on loan to Football League clubs. He joined Brighton &amp; Hove Albion of the Championship in 2014, and helped them win promotion to the Premier League in his third season with the club. He turned down a new contract with Brighton, and signed for Birmingham City in 2017. In the 2018–19 season, he spent short spells on loan at Southend United, Wycombe Wanderers and Coventry City. He has been called up to the England squad but remains uncapped.
He worked as head of recruitment for York City before joining Blyth Spartans where he was briefly first-team manager, and joined Farsley Celtic as manager in 2025.
Club career.
York City.
Born in Leeds, West Yorkshire, Stockdale played for the Huddersfield Town youth system before joining the York City youth system in 2000 and was promoted from the under-16 team to the under-19 team for a match against Bradford City in October 2001. He was offered a scholarship by the club in February 2002 to become a first-year trainee for the 2002–03 season. By March 2003 he had established himself as the York first team's number two goalkeeper, having ousted John Collinson. He made his debut for York as a 17-year-old when coming on as a 46th-minute substitute for Michael Ingham in the last match of 2002–03, which the team lost 2–0 at Oxford United on 3 May 2003.
Stockdale's first appearance of 2004–05 came as a 20th-minute substitute for Chris Porter in a 1–0 defeat to Accrington Stanley on 31 August 2004. After playing 19 successive matches from August to December, he was dropped by caretaker manager Viv Busby. Despite this, he stated his determination at earning a new contract with York. After discussing his future at York with manager Billy McEwan he was offered a one-year professional contract in April 2005. He stalled on this contract offer and McEwan criticised him, saying "He's a young apprentice getting his first professional contract and the last thing in his mind should be money. That should be of secondary importance and he should be grateful York City are offering him a contract". He was ruled out of most of York's pre-season schedule after breaking a bone in his foot in July. Contract talks between Stockdale and York progressed and on 9 August he signed on for the club.
Stockdale made a loan move to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Wakefield-Emley in September and made his debut in a 1–0 victory over Gateshead. After making seven appearances for Wakefield-Emley he returned to York in October and was rewarded with a place on the bench for the team's match against Canvey Island. Having lost his place on the bench to teenager Arran Reid he signed for Conference North club Worksop Town on 1 March 2006, after McEwan questioned his commitment to the club. He made his debut in a 1–1 draw with Vauxhall Motors on 14 March and the loan was extended for a second month in April. Stockdale made six appearances for Worksop. He was released by York at the end of 2005–06, after being publicly criticised by McEwan about his weight.
Darlington.
Stockdale joined League Two club Darlington on a one-year contract on 1 August 2006 after impressing in a period on trial in pre-season. He made eight appearances in 2006–07, and when first-choice goalkeeper Andy Oakes was sent off in the opening match of 2007–08, Stockdale took over and became manager Dave Penney's preferred choice in goal. Stockdale was rewarded with a new contract in November 2007, and went on to make over 40 appearances for Darlington in 2007–08. Stockdale was scouted by Premier League clubs including Birmingham City and Newcastle United before, in April 2008, Darlington accepted a bid from Fulham. He remained with Darlington until the end of the season, won the club's Player of the Year award, and played in the play-offs, in which they lost 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out to Rochdale in the semi-final after the matches had ended 3–3 on aggregate.
Fulham.
Stockdale completed his move to Fulham on 4 June 2008 on a two-year contract; the fee was undisclosed, but reported as £350,000 potentially rising to £600,000. He returned to League Two after joining Rotherham United on a one-month loan on 21 November. He made his debut a day later in a 2–0 defeat to Bradford City, and in his next match, a 1–1 draw away at Exeter City, he saved a Ben Watson penalty and made a late save from a Ryan Harley header. The loan deal was extended for a further month, and he finished the spell with eight appearances, all in league competition.
On 2 March 2009, Stockdale joined League One club Leicester City on a one-month loan as cover for senior goalkeepers David Martin and Paul Henderson after previous loanee Mark Bunn was recalled by parent club Blackburn Rovers. He made his debut in Leicester's 1–1 draw with Stockport County the next day. He later picked up a shoulder injury, which led to Leicester signing Tony Warner on loan. Stockdale extended his loan at Leicester until the end of the season on 6 April. He played for Leicester as their promotion to the Championship as League One champions was confirmed after a 2–0 victory over Southend United, after which he said he would be interested in joining the club for the following season.
Stockdale made his Fulham debut on 13 September 2009 in a 2–1 victory at home to Everton. Stockdale was Fulham's number two goalkeeper for the team's UEFA Europa League campaign; he was at the centre of controversy when he and the reserve goalkeepers were injured ahead of the fixture against FC Basel, but UEFA refused to allow the club to bring in the club's other senior goalkeeper, Pascal Zuberbühler, at short notice. On 29 December, his contract was extended to June 2013. On 22 January 2010, he joined Championship club Plymouth Argyle on a one-month loan until 18 February, after impressing in a behind-closed-doors friendly between the two clubs. He made 21 appearances for the club as they were relegated to League One.
Due to Mark Schwarzer being injured in pre-season and being linked with a move to Arsenal, Stockdale was the first-choice goalkeeper at Fulham at the start of the 2010–11 season. He started the season by keeping a clean sheet at Bolton Wanderers, and followed up by saving a penalty kick at Craven Cottage against Manchester United in a 2–2 draw on 22 August. He continued his run in the team in January due to Schwarzer's participation in the AFC Asian Cup, starting with West Bromwich Albion where he kept a clean sheet. He went on to appear in five further matches during January. Stockdale played 10 matches under manager Mark Hughes during 2010–11, 7 of which were in the Premier League.
In June 2011, new Fulham manager Martin Jol said he wanted to loan Stockdale out to get a regular run of matches, but had no intention of selling the player. After reports of interest from Championship clubs Swansea City and Leeds United, Stockdale said he would be willing to join either club and was prepared to drop down a division for regular football. Swansea had a £2 million bid rejected on 11 July, and Stockdale tweeted that he would "love to help [his] hometown club back to where they belong" if a move to Leeds became an option. He later stated that "complications" prevented such a move.
On 26 July 2011, Stockdale signed a new four-year contract with Fulham and subsequently went out on a one-year loan to Championship club Ipswich Town. He made 18 appearances for Ipswich before an injury to Mark Schwarzer in mid-December meant he was recalled to Fulham.
On 22 November 2012, Stockdale moved to Hull City on loan until 2 January 2013. He made his debut on 24 November 2012 in the 1–0 loss at home to Burnley. After making five appearances for Hull he was recalled by Fulham on 19 December 2012. Stockdale returned to Hull on 18 January 2013 on loan for what remained of the season, and made 19 appearances as the team earned promotion to the Premier League as Championship runners-up.
Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.
Stockdale signed for Championship club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee on 28 July 2014. He made his debut on 9 August, the opening day of the season, in a 1–0 defeat against Sheffield Wednesday, and appeared in 42 league matches as Albion finished 20th in the table. He was active in his support for the families of victims of the 2015 Shoreham Airshow crash, which led to his being named as Brighton &amp; Hove Albion's PFA Community Champion.
During the 2015–16 season, he kept 17 clean sheets, helping Brighton finish third in the Championship and qualify for the playoffs. They lost in the semi-final over two legs to Sheffield Wednesday.
Stockdale made 45 appearances in 2016–17, saving a Stefan Johansen penalty in a 2–1 win over his former club Fulham, and keeping 20 clean sheets as Brighton were promoted to the Premier League. A poor finish to the season, during which Stockdale scored two own goals in a defeat away to Norwich City, meant Albion finished as runners-up to Newcastle United. He was named in the 2016–17 PFA Championship Team of the Year, and was runner-up to Anthony Knockaert as Albion's player of the season.
Birmingham City.
Stockdale chose to reject Brighton's offer of a new contract and instead signed for three years with Birmingham City of the Championship. He said afterwards that he needed a longer deal because he did not want to disrupt his daughter's education by uprooting the family as often as had happened in the past. He went straight into the starting eleven for the opening fixture of the 2017–18 season, which Birmingham lost 1–0 away to Ipswich Town, and kept his place until he injured his wrist in mid September. He returned to the starting eleven two months later, in a 1–1 draw with Sheffield United, and kept his place for the rest of the campaign. He made what the "Daily Telegraph" reporter dubbed a magnificent save from Fulham's Aleksandar Mitrović in the final game of the season to help Birmingham avoid relegation and end their opponents' 23-match unbeaten run.
Stockdale joined Southend United on 8 September 2018 on an initial seven-day loan, as the League One club had only one goalkeeper available. He made his debut the same day, starting in their 3–2 home defeat to Peterborough United, and played three matches before Southend's main goalkeeper, Mark Oxley, returned from suspension.
Stockdale joined another League One club, Wycombe Wanderers, on 22 November on a seven-day emergency loan, due to injuries to both first- and second-choice keepers, Ryan Allsop and Yves Ma-Kalambay. He made his debut in a 3–2 win at home to Shrewsbury Town, and in his second match, in which Wycombe came back from a goal down to win away to Accrington Stanley, the Press Association reported that "Accrington could have extended their advantage but for [Stockdale's] heroics".
His third stint on loan in League One began on 8 February 2019; this time he joined Coventry City, both of whose senior goalkeepers were injured. He played twice before returning to his parent club.
He played in Birmingham's 3–0 defeat away to Portsmouth in August 2019, when manager Pep Clotet fielded a shadow squad, but the starting spot in league matches was shared by Lee Camp and Connal Trueman. After Wycombe Wanderers' second-choice goalkeeper, Cameron Yates, was injured in training, Stockdale returned to the club on 24 January 2020 on loan until the end of the season. He was an unused substitute in Wycombe's 2–1 win over Oxford in the 2020 League One play-off final at Wembley, as the club was promoted to the Championship for the first time.
Wycombe Wanderers.
After being released from Birmingham, Stockdale signed for Wycombe Wanderers for a third occasion, this time permanently. He re-joined the club on 9 September 2020, agreeing a one-year deal. He served as back-up goalkeeper to Ryan Allsop throughout the 2019–20 season, making two appearances in all competitions.
Loan to Stevenage.
Having not played first-team football in over a year, Stockdale joined League Two club Stevenage on an emergency two-week loan deal on 2 February 2021, providing temporary cover for the injured Jamie Cumming. He made his debut for Stevenage in the club's 1–0 home defeat to Exeter City on the same day as his signing was announced. In his third appearance for Stevenage, Stockdale provided the assist for Danny Newton's goal in a 1–0 away victory at Tranmere Rovers on 9 February 2021. It was also Stockdale's first clean sheet in over two years. He was subsequently named in the EFL League Two 'Team of the Week' for his performance. In the final appearance of the two-week agreement, Stockdale saved a 90th-minute penalty to help Stevenage record a 1–0 victory at Crawley Town; again being named in the EFL League Two 'Team of the Week'.
Return to Wycombe.
Just four days after his return from Stevenage, Stockdale made his first competitive start for Wycombe in over a year after Allsop suffered an injury in training. He helped the team to keep a clean sheet on his return; as Wycombe and Millwall played out a goalless draw at The Den on 20 February 2021. He continued as first choice for the rest of the season, as Wycombe were relegated to League One. He renewed his contract in May 2021, as Allsop left the club on a free transfer. Stockdale was the undisputed first choice throughout the 2021-22 season, starting every game and keeping 18 clean sheets. For that tally he was awarded the 2021–22 League One Golden Glove, jointly with Plymouth Argyle's Michael Cooper.
Sheffield Wednesday.
On 15 June 2022, it was announced Stockdale would join Sheffield Wednesday following the expiration of his contract at Wycombe. He made his Wednesday debut, starting against Portsmouth on 30 July 2022. Following promotion back to the EFL Championship it was confirmed that Stockdale would be released following the end of his contract.
Return to York City.
On 4 June 2023, York City confirmed that Stockdale would be returning to the club, combining the role with head of recruitment. Stockdale was released by York City on 22 April 2024.
International career.
He was named in the England C squad (non-League under-23s) in October 2004 for a friendly against Italy, and he came on as a substitute for Nikki Bull in the 1–0 victory on 10 November. He was included in the 25-man squad for England for the match against Denmark in February 2011 after impressing manager Fabio Capello with his calmness standing in for Schwarzer at Fulham. Stockdale was also called up for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier with Switzerland, however he withdrew from the squad and was replaced by Robert Green.
Coaching career.
Stockdale joined recently relegated Northern Premier League Premier Division club Blyth Spartans on 5 August 2024 as assistant to the newly appointed manager Nolberto Solano. Following Solano's sacking on 27 August, Stockdale acted as interim manager before being given the job permanently on 13 September. The club was sold in late October, and Stockdale was sacked after just 48 days in post.
On 12 February 2025, National League North club Farsley Celtic appointed Stockdale as their fourth manager of the season. With the club in dire financial straits and further relegated to the 9th tier, Stockdale agreed to purchase the club in June 2025.
Personal life.
Stockdale married his fiancée Kate on 3 June 2011, missing out on a place in the England squad for the Euro 2012 qualifier with Switzerland the following day.

Hasketon

Hasketon is a village and civil parish in the East Suffolk District of Suffolk, England.
Its church, St. Andrews, is one of 38 existing round-tower churches in Suffolk. St. Andrews stands more or less at the centre of its scattered parish, and is set in a tree-shaded churchyard which, in 1845, had been planted with beech, fir and elm.
History of St Andrews Church.
There has been a church at this place for more than 900 years. This ancient church contains craftsmanship from many periods. From what can be seen and derived from what little documentary evidence is available, the history of this church is as follows:
The 11th century: The earliest part of the present church is the nave, where evidence of late Saxon or early Norman work in the layered masonry with which parts of the walls are faced can be found. There is also a little herring-bone masonry in the south wall, where there remains a tiny blocked window of this date. Clearly the core of the nave dates from the period just before or just after the Norman Conquest of 1066.
The late 11th or early 12th century: A little later the round tower was added at the west end of the nave.
The 13th century: The single lancet windows in the north walls of the nave and chancel survive from this period.
c.1300: The round tower was heightened by the addition of its octagonal belfry-stage (later restored with brick) and also received its west window. Some similar windows to those in the belfry-stage were placed in the nave and chancel.
The 14th and early 15th centuries: Several of the present windows in the nave and the chancel date from this time; they probably replaced earlier windows like the blocked 11th century one. The north and south doorways are also of 14th century date.
At the Reformation and afterwards, the interior of the church was altered to cater for the new liturgical requirements of the established church. Much of the colour and carvings went, also the stained glass and the rood with its loft and screen.
The year 1844 saw the arrival of new rector Thomas Maude, and it was he who was responsible for the restoration of the church by gradual stages. The font – originally given c.1450 by members of the Brewse family, who owned the manor of Hasketon from the late 13th century until c.1489 – was cleaned and restored shortly after the arrival of Maude, and a small gallery at the west end of the nave was replaced by a carved wooden tower screen. The major restoration took place during the 1860s. In 1863, work was done on the nave, the church was re-roofed, the chancel restored and the vestry added in 1865. The nave received a new set of benches in 1866, and two years later the porch was rebuilt. In 1899, a new bell was given and three others recast.
The present organ was given in 1904, the year the choir-stalls were also made. The reredos was erected in 1920.
Additions of recent years include among others the interior decoration, the kneelers, the festal frontal and the list of Rectors.
Today, the building is still in regular use for Christian worship.
Peggy Harrison (1907-1993), the widow of Sir James Harwood Harrison, 1st Baronet (1907-1980), a Conservative Party politician, is buried in the churchyard. He is buried at Bugbrooke, Northamptonshire where his family lived for many years.

Herbert Massey

Air Commodore Herbert Martin Massey, (19 January 189829 February 1976) was a senior officer in the Royal Air Force. He was the Senior British Officer at Stalag Luft III who authorised the "Great Escape".
Flying career.
Massey entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1915, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment in April 1916. He soon after underwent flying training, and was posted as a pilot to No. 16 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps from July. He was promoted temporary captain and made a flight commander in December 1916. On 4 February 1917, Massey was wounded and his observer killed when their aircraft was shot down by German ace Werner Voss.
Transferring to the newly created Royal Air Force in 1918, Massey continued his military career through the interwar period. He commanded No. 6 Squadron in operations during the Arab Revolt in Palestine, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, and was a station commander during the early years of the Second World War. He was officer commanding of No. 10 Operational Training Unit with temporary rank of group captain made permanent in 1942.
He was on a Short Stirling of No. 7 Squadron RAF during the second Thousand-bomber raid when it was shot down near the Dutch coast during a raid in night of 1/2 June 1942, and was captured by the Germans. Massey then became the Senior British Officer at Stalag Luft III, and authorised the "Great Escape" in March 1943. Massey had suffered severe wounds to the same leg in both wars and walked with a limp. There would be no escape for him but as Senior British Officer, he had to know what was going on. Massey had been a veteran escaper himself and had been in trouble with the Gestapo. His experience allowed him to offer sound advice to the X-Organisation.
Due to ill-health he was repatriated to the UK in 1944.
Legacy.
After Massey's death in 1976, a memorial service in his honour was held on 22 May 1976 at St Clement Danes Church.
Massey was the basis for the character "Group Captain Ramsey" in the film "The Great Escape" (1963), played by actor James Donald.
Massey has been portrayed by Peter Dennis in the made-for-TV film "" (1988).
In 2016, a Blue plaque was unveiled at the Hilton House Hotel where Massey was born, the first Blue Plaque in the village of Hilton.

Blizard Building

The Blizard Building is a building in Whitechapel in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It houses the Blizard Institute, formerly known as the Blizard Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, part of Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.
The building is named after William Blizard, who founded the London Hospital Medical College in 1785.
History.
The building was commissioned in Autumn 2000, and designed by the architect Will Alsop. Construction began in November 2003, with AMEC as the main contractor, and was completed in March 2005, at a cost of £45 million. It was officially opened in October 2005 by The Princess Royal.
Construction on a £2 million extension in the form of a Neuron Pod began in April 2018 and was completed in March 2019. This extension, also designed by Alsop, was one of his last works, as he died one month after construction began.
Design.
The building consists of two glass-clad and steel-framed pavilions, separated by a central yard, and connected to each other by a multi-coloured glass walkway. The glass cladding of the pavilions includes some coloured panels designed by the artist Bruce McLean, depicting images inspired by molecular science.
The walkway also provides access to the Neuron Pod, a free standing steel structure located at the northern end of the central yard. The pod is modelled on a nerve cell, and covered with hundred of plastic filaments, designed to look like hairs. These filaments are illuminated by optical fibres powered by projectors inside the pod.
The larger, eastern pavilion contains a large, open void, allowing light natural light to reach the open-plan research laboratories located on the lower ground floor. Four, smaller, multipurpose pods of various shapes and sizes are suspended above this void. The smaller, narrower western pavilion houses the electrical and mechanical machinery required to power the building, hidden behind a zinc cladding system.
The building was awarded the 2006 RIBA award and the 2006 Civic Trust Award.
Facilities.
The eastern pavilion contains the main research facilities, including the underground laboratories, as well as office spaces and study areas. The western pavilion contains the main entrance, a waiting area, a café, additional research facilities and a 400-seat lecture theatre.
The Neuron Pod located in between the two pavilions is home to the Centre of the Cell, a science education centre specifically aimed at children. The centre was opened by Blue Peter presenter Helen Skelton in September 2009 and was initially located in one of the smaller pods within the main research building, but was relocated upon completion of the Neuron Pod in 2019. It is the first science education centre in the world to be located within biomedical research laboratories, and is aimed at getting children from the local area interested in science and research.
In popular culture.
In the third episode of the third series of the BBC crime drama "Luther", broadcast in 2013, the Blizard Building was used as the filming location for a scene in which DCI John Luther (Idris Elba) meets Mary Day (Sienna Guillory).

Soundtrack.
The music was composed by Pravin Mani.
Critical reception.
Malini Mannath of "Chennai Online" wrote, "It' a fast-paced entertainer that at times trips and stumbles with loose ends, flaws, and quite a few unanswered questions. But what keeps it going, with not a moment to dwell on the flaws and get distracted, is its racy narrative. The debutant director (with years of experience apprenticing under directors like Maharajan) keeps the action moving rapidly with not a lagging moment". Shyam Balasubramaniam of "Rediff.com" wrote, ""Perarasu" is probably worth a watch". Lajjavathi of "Kalki" praised the Vijayakanth film for giving space for other actors too while praising the sharp dialogues but panned the film for having revenge plot as flashback.

Modesto Lafuente

Modesto Lafuente y Zamalloa (1 May 1806 at Rabanal de los Caballeros, Cervera de Pisuerga, Palencia Province – 25 October 1866 at Madrid) was a Spanish critic and historian. In 1861 he was elected Vice President of the Congress of Deputies and, in February 7, 1862, he assumed the office of acting president of the Congress due to the death in office of Francisco Martínez de la Rosa until February 18, 1862.
Biography.
He received his early education in his native town, but later took courses at the Universities of Santiago, Astorga and Valladolid, receiving at the last institution the degree of Bachelor of Theology in 1832.
He was appointed to the chair of philosophy and later to that of theology at the University of Astorga, but he remained only a short time, for he decided to devote himself to journalism, and moved to Madrid.
Writings.
Under the pseudonyms of Fray Gerundio and Pelegrin Tirabeque, he wrote many "capilladas" or essays on a great variety of subjects, including the political questions of the day. According to Ferrer del Rio, he borrowed the pseudonym Fray Gerundio from the work of Father Isla. His essays, and all his works, were written in an easy, flowing, popular style, and they became so popular that it was not long before his paper was read in every corner of Spain. The essays were collected as "Capilladas" (1837–40) and as "Teatro social del siglo XIX" (1846), the latter dealing with the manners and customs of the day.
Lafuente's chief work, by which he is best known, is his "Historia general de España", which he published in Madrid (1850–1869, 30 volumes). A second edition (13 volumes) was published in 1874–1875. It was later edited and revised by Juan Valera (25 vols., 1887–90).
Another notable work is "Viaje aerostático del Fray Gerundio y Tirabeque". It is divided into two parts, the first being a review of aerial navigation, and the second, a satire on the political situation in Europe.
The important events of 1848 caused him to write his "Revista Europea" which he published as a periodical for about one year.

Child &amp; Co.

Child &amp; Co. was a historic private bank in the United Kingdom, later integrated into the RBS division of the NatWest Group. The bank operated from its long-standing premises at 1 Fleet Street, on the western edge of the City of London, near the Temple Bar Memorial and opposite the Royal Courts of Justice.
In June 2022, the last remaining physical branch closed its doors. Despite this, RBS assured customers that the Child &amp; Co. brand would "remain," with no accounts being closed. Banking services are now provided through digital platforms or other RBS and NatWest branches.
History.
Child &amp; Co. was the third-oldest bank in the world and the oldest bank in the UK, predating the Bank of England by thirty years.
Origins.
Child &amp; Co. traced its roots to a London goldsmith business in the late 17th century, whose premises were known by the sign of the Marygold. Sir Francis Child established his business as a goldsmith in 1664, when he entered into partnership with Robert Blanchard. Child married Blanchard's stepdaughter and inherited the whole business upon Blanchard's death. Renamed Child &amp; Co., the business thrived and was appointed as "jeweller in ordinary" to King William III.
Child took over most of the assets of Coggs &amp; Dann, a goldsmith banker "at the sign of the Kings Head in the Strand, over against St. Clement Danes Church", after the bank became insolvent in 1710 due to a massive fraud orchestrated by gentleman fraudster Thomas Brerewood, which became known as the Pitkin Affair.
After Child died in 1713, his three sons ran the business. During this time, the firm transformed from a goldsmith business to a fully fledged bank. It claimed to be the first bank to introduce a pre-printed cheque form, prior to which customers simply wrote a letter to their bank but sent it to their creditor who presented it for payment. Its first bank note was issued in 1729.
1782 to 1924.
By 1782, Child's grandson Robert Child was the senior partner in the firm. However, when he died in 1782 without any sons to inherit the business, he did not want to leave it to his only daughter, Sarah Anne Child, because he was furious over her elopement with John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, earlier in the year. To prevent the Earls of Westmorland from ever acquiring his wealth, he left it in trust to his daughter's second-surviving son or eldest daughter. This turned out to be Lady Sarah Sophia Fane, who was born in 1785.
From the death of Robert Child (in 1782) until 1793, the bank was managed by his widow, Sarah Child. Their granddaughter Lady Sarah Sophia Fane married George Child-Villiers, 5th Earl of Jersey, in 1804 and upon her majority in 1806, she became the senior partner. She exercised her rights personally until her death in 1867. At that point, the Earl of Jersey and Frederick William Price of Harringay House were appointed as the two leading partners. Ownership continued in the Child-Villiers family until the 1920s.
1924 sale and subsequent years.
George Child-Villiers, 8th Earl of Jersey, sold the firm in 1924 to Glyn, Mills, Currie, Holt &amp; Co., which retained it as a separate business. Glyn, Mills &amp; Co. was in turn acquired by The Royal Bank of Scotland in 1931 and merged with Williams Deacon's Bank to form Williams &amp; Glyn's Bank in 1969. Williams and Glyn's Bank was fully integrated into The Royal Bank of Scotland in 1985 and ceased to operate separately.
A branch was opened in Oxford in 1932. During World War II, the main banking departments were evacuated to Osterley in West London and in 1942, the Oxford branch was transferred to Martins Bank. In 1977, a representative office was once again opened at St. Giles’ in Oxford.
Fleet Street location.
After Temple Bar was removed and Fleet Street was widened in 1880, Child &amp; Co. occupied a Grade II* listed building at 1 Fleet Street, which was designed by John Gibson. The bank had previously operated from the same Fleet Street site since 1673. The building was refurbished in 2015.
In February 2022, Child &amp; Co. wrote to its clients informing them of the closure of its Fleet Street branch on 29 June 2022.
Clients.
Over the course of its 350-year history, Child &amp; Co. attracted an exclusive client base that included the Honourable Societies of Middle Temple and Lincoln's Inn, as well as numerous wealthy families. A number of Oxford colleges and several universities, including the London School of Economics and Imperial College London, were also reported to hold accounts. 
Child &amp; Co. had a legal and professional services hub that supported many of the biggest law firms, as well as three of the Big Four accounting firms in the UK.
It is believed that Child &amp; Co. was the model for Charles Dickens' fictitious Tellson's Bank in "A Tale of Two Cities" (1859).

WJET (AM)

WJET (1400 kHz; "Jet Radio 1400") is a commercial AM radio station in Erie, Pennsylvania. It broadcasts a talk radio format and is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. WJET's studios are in the Boston Store building in downtown Erie.
WJET has a power of 1,000 watts. The transmitter is at the intersection of East 18th Street and Ash Street in the city of Erie. Programming is also heard on 250-watt FM translator W244DX at 96.7 MHz.
Programming.
WJET primarily runs conservative talk hosts from the co-owned Premiere Networks. Weekdays begin with a local news and information show, "Erie Talk in the Morning," hosted by Barry Dain Steinhagen. The rest of the schedule is made up of nationally syndicated shows: "The Glenn Beck Program", "The Sean Hannity Show", "The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show", "The Jesse Kelly Show", "The Joe Pags Show", "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory" and "America in the Morning with John Trout".
Weekends include "Kim Komando", "Free Talk Live", "Bill Handel on the Law", "Money Talk with Bob Brinker", "Mike Gallager" and "iHeartRadio Podcast Premiere". Under previous ownership, "The Rush Limbaugh Show" was dropped in December 2008 after Premiere Networks demanded higher fees from WJET's owner to carry Limbaugh. It was immediately restored when iHeartMedia assumed ownership of the radio station in 2019.
History.
WJET signed on the air in 1951. It was powered at only 250 watts and its studios were at 1635 Ash Street, where WJET's transmitter is located to this day. For much of its early history, the station was owned by WJET, Inc., a subsidiary of Myron Jones Stations.
During the 1960s and 1970s, WJET had a Top 40 format, playing the big hits of the day. But by the 1980s, most music listening had shifted from AM to FM stations. In 1986, WJET Broadcasting bought an FM station at 102.3 MHz, and shifted its Top 40 format to that station, giving it the WJET call sign. AM 1400 became talk station WLKK, carrying programming from NBC Talknet and the Mutual Broadcasting System.
Connoisseur Media later bought WJET and WLKK. In 2001, the WJET call letters returned to AM 1400. FM 102.3 is now WQHZ, owned by Cumulus Media.
On March 27, 2019, Connoisseur Media announced that it would transfer WJET and its other Erie stations to iHeartMedia in exchange for WFRE and WFMD in the Frederick, Maryland, radio market. WFRE and WFMD were part of the Aloha Station Trust. The sale closed on May 20, 2019.
In August 2021, the Erie Otters hockey team announced a radio partnership with WJET, beginning with the 2021-2022 OHL season.

<doc id="7019516" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7019516" title="Writers Guild of America, East">
Writers Guild of America, East

The Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) is a labor union representing writers in film, television, radio, news, and online media.
The WGAE and the Writers Guild of America West (WGAW), though independent entities, jointly brand themselves together as the Writers Guild of America (WGA), and cooperate on activities such as launching coordinated strike actions and administering the Writers Guild of America Awards. The WGAE is an affiliate of the AFL–CIO and the International Affiliation of Writers Guilds.
History.
WGAE had its beginnings in 1912, when the Authors' League of America (ALA) was formed by some 350 book and magazine authors, as well as dramatists. In 1921, this group split into two branches of the League: the Dramatists Guild of America for writers of stage and, later, radio drama and the Authors Guild (AG) for novelists and nonfiction book and magazine authors.
That same year, the Screen Writers Guild came into existence in Hollywood, California, but was "little more than a social organization", according to the WGAE's website, until the Great Depression of the 1930s and the growth of the organized labor movement impelled it to take a more active role in negotiating and guaranteeing writers' contractual rights and protections.
In 1933, the AG and SWG joined forces, and two years later, with passage of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, called for an election to represent writers of films in collective bargaining agreements; the first such agreement was signed in 1942. Meanwhile, the Radio Writers Guild was formed in New York and became part of the ALA.
A Television Writers Group within the AG and a separate group, the Television Writers of America, each began representing writers for the nascent television industry beginning in the late 1940s. In 1951, the AG reorganized into the Writers Guild of America East and West, in recognition of the growing complexity of representing members in many different fields of entertainment writing. Writers working in motion pictures, TV and radio would be represented by these two new guilds, while the Authors Guild and the Dramatists Guild continued to represent print-media writers. The WGAW and WGAE have bargained for writers in movies, TV and radio since 1954.
The conservative anti-communist faction of WGAW and WGAE, initially collaborated with the Hollywood movie studio/network heads and the U.S. government when they drove most writers (who originally formed the Screen Writers Guild and the Writers Guild East unions) out of the domestic entertainment industry during the McCarthy Era.
The WGAE became affiliated with the AFL-CIO in 1989, although its sister group WGAW did not join and has not since.
2007–2008 strike.
On November 5, 2007, both branches of the guild, East and West, called a strike against all television networks and cable channels over writers' share of revenues from DVD releases, Internet, cell-phone network, and other new-media uses of programs and films written by members. The strike vote followed the expiration of the guild's then-current contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. The strike ceased on February 12, 2008.
Packaging deal ban.
In early-2019, ahead of the expiration of its franchise agreements with the Association of Talent Agents (ATA) on April 6, the WGA announced an intent to enforce a new Code of Conduct prohibiting talent agents from holding any financial stake in the producer of a work written by its members or deriving "any revenue or other benefit from a Writer's involvement in or employment" in a covered work, besides a percentage commission. The latter clause was intended primarily to prohibit the practice of movie packaging deals.
On April 12, 2019, the WGA failed to renew its franchise agreement with the ATA (which attempted to compromise by proposing that writers receive 0.8% of gross profits from packaging deals); its executive director Karen Stuart stated that "despite our best efforts, today's outcome was driven by the Guild's predetermined course for chaos", and that the Code of Conduct "will hurt all artists, delivering an especially painful blow to mid-level and emerging writers, while dictating how agencies of all sizes should function." Many major talent agencies, including the four dominant Hollywood agencies (William Morris Agency, Creative Artists Agency, United Talent Agency and ICM Partners) refused to sign the Code of Conduct. Nevertheless, the WGA stated that effective April 13, WGA members would be prohibited from working with agents that have not signed the Code of Conduct, and would be obligated to fire them.
On April 17, 2019, WGA East and WGA West filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against WMA, CAA, UTA, and ICM, citing that the practice of movie packaging represented kickbacks that were illegal under the Taft-Hartley Act. Approximately 95 percent of Guild members voted "in favor of a code of conduct that would cease packaging fees." During the week following its lawsuit filing; "en masse", over 7,000 Guild members fired their talent agents (as ordered by the Guild), as "not just drastically out-earning them, but preventing them from receiving better pay." WGA West president David Goodman stated that "in a period of unprecedented profits and growth of our business ... writers themselves are actually earning less".
In June 2019, the WGA and ATA resumed talks. The WGA rejected its offers (which once again included a revenue sharing proposal), with Goodman stating that "we will not counter on revenue sharing because it suggests the answer is somewhere in the middle. It is not". He stated that the WGA planned to bypass the ATA and negotiate individually with nine individual agencies that represented a "significant" number of WGA members, and that "this fight has shown the Guild's strength and sense of purpose."
After Endeavor and the UTA filed lawsuits against the WGA accusing it of engaging in an "illegal group boycott", the WGA sent a cease and desist notice to the ATA stating that "the ATA and its members have continued to collusively impose packaging fees on programs written by WGA-represented writers", and that "following news that Verve had negotiated a Code of Conduct and Franchise Agreement with the WGA, the ATA, and its leading members closed ranks and threatened to retaliate against Verve and, implicitly, against any agency that subsequently reached an agreement with the guild."
All four major agencies later signed franchise agreements with the WGA, which include mandating compliance with the Code of Conduct by prohibiting them from holding more than a 20% interest in an affiliated production company.

Battle of Hòa Bình

The Battle of Hòa Bình was fought during the First Indochina War. It occurred from 10 November 1951 to 25 February 1952, when French Union forces attempted to lure the Việt Minh out into the open and to force it to fight on French terms.
Prelude.
Following the string of defensive victories during the early months of 1951, the French command under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny sought to go back on the offensive. After the French victory at the battle of Đông Triều, de Lattre had drawn up a plan to test his offensive strategy.
Hòa Bình, capital of the Muong people, located from Hanoi, was selected by General de Lattre for the offensive. Hòa Bình was an area of strategic significance for many reasons. For the Việt Minh, the control of Hòa Bình would allow them free movement in the valleys north of Hanoi as well as the flow of military supplies. De Lattre’s plan was to take Hòa Bình, where Giáp's regular divisions would be forced to confront superior French firepower and eventually be destroyed.
Battle.
Phase I &amp; II.
On 10 November 1951, Operation Tulipe was launched with the objective of seizing Chợ Bến Pass and extending French control beyond Provincial Route 21.
After the French Task Force North and the 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion (1er BEP) had linked up west of Chợ Bến, they both continued the thrust while other mobile groups were moving in from the south and the east. At this point, the Việt Minh were forced to abandon Chợ Bến, but heavy fighting occurred between the French and elements of the Việt Minh that included the 64th Regiment and 164th Regional Battalion. By the end of the day, the French Union forces had achieved their objective with Mobile Group 2 and 1st Colonial Parachute Battalion (1er BPC) reaching their target north of Chợ Bến.
With the completion of the first phase, de Lattre planned his next move. Realizing the difficulty of phase two, de Lattre divided French Union forces into three operational groups, which together would capture Hòa Bình by land, sea and air. Mobile Group 7, as part of Group North, would move southward along the Black River with a riverine unit. Group South, which consists of Mobile Group 3, would link up with paratroop battalions in Hòa Bình. Mobile Group 2 would form an operational liaison group for the other two Mobile Groups.
By the early hours of 14 November, both Operational Group North and South had reached their initial objectives. On the morning of 14 November, the 1st Colonial Parachute Battalion, the 2nd Colonial Parachute Battalion (2e BPC) and the 7th Colonial Parachute Battalion (7e BPC) captured Hòa Bình with ease against little or no resistance from the Việt Minh.
Mobile Group 3 took the lead in the clearing operations along Colonial Route 6, while Mobile Group 3 linked up with the three paratroop battalions after crossing the Black River. By 22 November, the operation was over with the French Union troops having suffered light casualties.
Giáp's counterattack.
On 21 November, General Võ Nguyên Giáp decided to deal with the French by ordering his 304th and 312th Divisions from the Red River. The two divisions were ordered to move against French lines of communication leading to Hòa Bình.
French bases at Ap Da Chong, Ap Phu To, Dan The, La Phu, Rocher Notre-Dame, Xom Bu and Tu Vu were places where General Giáp's regular divisions would initiate the first challenge. The 304th and 312th divisions were in position to isolate Ap Da Chong and cut French communication lines and isolate or eliminate strongpoints. Due to the build-up of Việt Minh forces in the area, elements of the 1st Colonial Parachute Battalion were ordered to reinforce Thu Phap.
Between 10 December and 14 December, there were heavy engagements between the French Union and Việt Minh forces. First, the Việt Minh 88th Regiment pounded Tu Vu but was driven off by two Moroccan companies supported by tanks. Then the 165th and 209th Regiments of the Việt Minh 312th Division infiltrated Ba Tri and Ba Vì, where they faced Mobile Group 4. The 5th Colonial Parachute Battalion, with support from Sherman tanks, was sent in to remove the Việt Minh. A company from the 5e BPC, however, was ambushed by the 165th Regiment and heavy casualties were suffered as a result.
On 11 January 1952, General de Lattre died at the Neuilly military hospital due to cancer. At the same time, Võ Nguyên Giáp began to concentrate his troops on Hòa Bình and Colonial Route 6 as the 304th, 308th and 312th Divisions were being redeployed with fresh reinforcements.
From the end of 1951, the buildup of Việt Minh presence around Colonial Route 6 was noted by French military intelligence. The Việt Minh made no secret of their presence, as they regularly attacked French convoys and conducted sapper attacks on French positions. The new commander of French Union forces, General Gonzales de Linares, planned to take back Colonial Route 6 piece by piece.
Between 10 January and 29 January, the French Union armies managed to clear Dong Ben, Xom Pheo, Bai Lang, Xuan Mai, Kem Pass and Ao Trach under heavy Việt Minh pressure. Each time, French forces relied upon artillery and close air support to inflict damages on the Việt Minh. On 30 January, the Việt Minh went back on the offensive at Suc Sich, where they battled with a company from the 8th Colonial Parachute Battalion.
Although the French army still held Hòa Bình and Colonial Route 6, the area under true French control extended only from Hanoi to Xuan Mai. Manning French outposts between Don Goi and Hoa Binh put heavy pressure on French manpower, where 20,000 troops were tied down. As a result of this, when the Việt Minh 316th and 320th Divisions moved in to replace the other divisions, General Salan decided to withdraw the remaining French forces. By 25 February 1952, the evacuation of French troops from Hòa Bình was completed.
Aftermath.
From the beginning, French Union forces sought to draw the Việt Minh out to fight on French terms; however, they subsequently went on the defensive as General Võ Nguyên Giáp continued to put heavy pressure on French positions. Although suffering heavier casualties than the French, the Việt Minh came out victorious. Casualties were heavy on both sides, with Tucker listing French losses as 436 killed and 458 missing, and Viet Minh casualties of approximately 12,000. Davidson records total French casualties of around 5,000 men, while Viet Minh losses were "at least that number".

Friedrich von Roehm

Friedrich von Roehm, also known as the Black Rook, is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as an adversary of the X-Men.
Von Roehm possesses a hereditary ability that is likened to lycanthropy. Von Roehm undergoes a transformation from his ordinary human form through a process mentally activated by Selene. He attained the rank of "Black Rook," of the Lords Cardinal of the New York branch of the Hellfire Club, an exclusive secret society bent on world domination. In civilian life, he was a jeweler.
Publication history.
Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Bill Sienkiewicz, the Black Rook first appeared in "New Mutants" #22 (December 1984).
The character subsequently appears in "The Uncanny X-Men" #189 (January 1985), and #208 - 209 (August - September 1986), in which he dies.
Fictional character biography.
Apparentally German by birth, Friedrich von Roehm operated a jewelry shop on New York City's Park Avenue. Von Roehm was also secretly a lycanthrope and a high priest of the supernatural being and self-described goddess Selene. Von Roehm, who had worshipped Selene as a goddess, became her personal servant when she showed up in his jewelry shop.
As a member of the Hellfire Club, von Roehm sponsored Selene for membership. Selene became the new Black Queen, and von Roehm served as the Black Rook. Alongside the Hellfire Club, he later battled the X-Men in New York's Central Park. Selene used powers to mentally trigger von Roehm's hereditary lycanthropy and sent him in pursuit of Rachel Summers. When Nimrod intervened to attack the X-Men and the Club, Storm proposed an alliance to battle Nimrod. Von Roehm rejected this proposal and attempted to attack the X-Men, but was disintegrated by Nimrod.
Powers and abilities.
Von Roehm possessed a power likened to lycanthropy. Von Roehm did not undergo the typical change in appearance associated with werewolves. However, he acquired superhuman strength, enhanced senses, claws, and barely controllable bloodlust during his transformation. His powers were genetically based, but required mental triggering by Selene. Aside from his personal devotion to Selene, von Roehm was apparentally mentally compelled to obey Selene while in his superhuman state.
In other media.
Friedrich Von Roehm, among other Hellfire Club members, was originally planned to appear in "Dark Phoenix", but was ultimately cut from the film.

I. Kathleen Hagen

Idella Kathleen Hagen (November 15, 1945 – April 18, 2015) was a former medical doctor who gained notoriety for being accused of murder by asphyxia of her parents, Idella Hagen, aged 92, and James Hagen, aged 86, with a plastic bag and a pillow as they slept in their home in Chatham Township, New Jersey, in August 2000. A month earlier, she had returned to her parents' house from her home in the Virgin Islands because of their age and deteriorating health. Hagen, a woman of considerable means, had previously cut short a medical career in urology in 1987 to move to the Virgin Islands to operate an inn with her second husband.
Education and professional career.
Raised in Chatham Township, Hagen graduated from Chatham High School in 1963.
A 1973 graduate of the Harvard Medical School, she became the first woman appointed a resident in urology at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She was appointed chief of urology at the Rutgers Medical School in New Jersey in 1982.
Trial.
The defense argued for an insanity plea. A defense psychiatrist, Robert L. Sadoff, stated that soon after Hagen returned to her home on Fairmount Avenue, Chatham New Jersey. Her chronic depression deepened because of her two failed marriages, the loss of her medical career, her fears about her parents' health, and her own fears that her depression would lead to institutionalization.
Both Sadoff and Dr. Steven Simring, who testified for the prosecution, said Hagen's depression deepened significantly in August 2000, to the point where she thought she was receiving messages from televisions ads, traffic lights and playing cards. They said she also heard a male voice she took to be her father's commanding her to commit the murders because, once they occurred, she and her parents would go to what Simring called a "childlike, magical sphere where they'd regain their happiness."
Deborah Factor, an assistant Morris County prosecutor, asked the psychiatrists if they considered the patricide-matricide acts of vindictiveness or mercy killings, and they both answered no.
Acquittal and confinement.
A New Jersey judge acquitted Hagen of charges after two psychiatrists testified that she was psychotic at the time.
After the psychiatrists agreed that Hagen had been depressed for years, was delusional during the murders and was now suicidal, Judge B. Theodore Bozonelis found her not guilty on grounds of insanity and committed her to a state mental health institution.
Judge Bozonelis did not order a specific term of confinement, but said he believed that she required long-term treatment in an institution because she is prone to unpredictable bouts of psychosis and is a danger to herself and society. Under the law, he said, Hagen was entitled to periodic hearings and reviews about her recovery and continued confinement.
Hagen was finally released by the hospital. This led to the creation of New Jersey's Kean's law that requires the police to notify residents when psychotic patients are released.
Death.
Hagen died, aged 69, on April 18, 2015, at her home. She was cremated.

The Vic Theatre

The Vic Theatre is a music venue located in Chicago, Illinois. Vic Theatre can easily accommodate 1,400 people or with a seated capacity of 1,000.
History.
Vic Theatre, designed by architect John Eberson, opened in 1912 as the Victoria Theatre. It took three years to build the luxurious five-story Vaudeville house. The theatre was owned and built by Robert E. Ricksen and Frank Gazzolo. Ricksen and Gazzolo operated the Crown and Imperial theaters as well. Costing $300,000 to construct it was equipped with every luxury. (Source: September 14, 1912 Billboard publication)
In 1983 The Vic was purchased by Walt Klein who spent several million restoring it. Opening with the 20th Anniversary of Second City and recorded for broadcast by HBO The Vic was originally programmed by Lou Valpano and Celebration Flipside. Within a year programming was handled by Dave Frey, who brought in Holiday Star Theater as a partner.
In 1986 Walt and his team brought in Thunderdome Enterprises to handle day-to-day operations and bring the popular ClubLand nightclub to extend the venue's operating hours. During this period concert booking and promotions were moved to Jam Productions. In 1988 Michael Butler produced the 20th anniversary revival of "Hair" at the Vic. In 1990 ClubLand closed, and Thunderdome Enterprises reconcepted the nightclub into the short-lived Catwalk. In the mid-1990's, Brew &amp; View was established at the Vic, offering movies and drinks on non-concert nights. Later, Walt sold The Vic to Jam Productions.

Holton, Suffolk

Holton is a village and civil parish in the East Suffolk district, in the county of Suffolk, England, near the town of Halesworth, with a population of 832 in the 2011 Census. Holton is split into two parts — Upper Holton and Holton.
History.
Although it is often referred to as Holton St Peter, such as in the name of its primary school, the 'St Peter' suffix was adopted by some village institutions to prevent confusion with Holton St Mary, another village in Suffolk. However, a proposed name change was rejected by the Parish Council and the village officially remains 'Holton' to this day. Holton is an Anglo-Saxon place name meaning 'village in a hollow' and the site was probably inhabited from Neolithic times. A few Roman artefacts have been found locally and it is possible that the Blyth river was forded here (at Mells) as it lies on the route of an ancient trackway from Dunwich to Beccles.
Holton Hall, demolished in 1957 and replaced by a caravan park, had many famous connections to the anti-slavery movement and Barclays Bank.
Features.
The church of Holton St Peter is one of 38 existing round-tower churches in Suffolk built by the Normans in the 11th century.
Holton has a primary school, two shops — Market Fields Farm Shop and Holton Orchards Farm Shop - and a public house, the Lord Nelson. This closed in 2008 but was later extended and refurbished, and re-opened in 2013 as a restaurant and pub. It closed again in July 2015. Apart from Bernard Matthews Farms, there is a small industrial site at the airfield with small workshops and a feed store. The community produces a bi-monthly magazine, 'The Holton Post'.
In 1814 John Brewster Wilkinson the son of john Wilkinson paid for the school to be built with an endowment of £200 a year (from whites directory of Suffolk 1842)
Holton also boasts a post mill, parts of which date back to the 18th century. The mill had been left in a state of disrepair in the 1960s but was rescued and has been restored on numerous occasions since, and its sails started working again in 1996. The mill is now under private ownership but is sometimes opened to the public.
Avian flu outbreak.
An outbreak of avian influenza of the H5N1 strain was confirmed on 3 February 2007, at a farm near Holton owned by Bernard Matthews.

Goodwill Shoe Company

Goodwill Shoe Company also known as Arthur A. Williams Shoes (after its founder) was a shoe brand specialized in leather shoes and steel toe "Safety First" boots. Among the earlier companies to produce such products at the time, it was one of the largest companies in manufacturing industrial boots by the 1930s. The company became bankrupt sometime in the mid-20th century.
Built in 1909, the Goodwill Shoe Company factory building remains at 26-28 Water Street, in Holliston, Massachusetts, today.
"This is a landmark example of a large show factory built at the peak of the shoe industry production, for the manufacture of heavy footwear for farmers and sportsmen. The two wood-frame buildings are located at either side of Water Street, and were originally connected by a second-story bridge above the street. [As well as an existing tunnel that exists beneath the pavement.] The building on the east side of the street is 4 stories high with a slate-roofed tower and is approximately 190 feet long; the building to the west is three stories in height and approximately 100 feet in length. Both still show their original clapboards and 6/6 sashes. Fenestration is characterized by bands of closely spaced, double hung, sash windows reaching the length of the facades."

Dyce Academy

Dyce Academy is the only state secondary school in Dyce, a small suburb of Aberdeen, serving as the sole provider of secondary education in the area. Dyce Academy's catchment area includes Dyce and the nearby village of Newmachar, though some pupils do attend from other nearby areas such as Bucksburn.
The school's construction began in the late 1970s and was completed in 1980. The building has typical architecture of state schools of this period, with concrete in abundance. The main section of the building has three floors hosting various departments whilst the Physical Education, Drama, Technical and Music departments are in various "wings" which come off of the building.
Uniform.
Dyce Academy has for most its existence, been a uniform-free school. However, following the retirement of Michael Taylor, the original head teacher of the school, in 2008, a dress code of black and white was introduced the following year. There is a red and blue striped tie which is now compulsory for all pupils.
Aberdeen City Music School.
Aberdeen City Music School (ACMS) has been based at Dyce Adademy since 2001. One of six centres of excellence – schools which allow gifted children to maximise their potential (four for music and one each for dance and sport). ACMS selects a small number of pupils who show a special ability in music. Admission is by audition. Each centre of excellence is located within a comprehensive school (Dyce Academy) from which pupils receive normal academic classes. Students are attracted from within the local region and even nationally. ACMS provides boarding facilities beside the school for pupils who come from more than three miles away.
2025 fire.
A fire occurred on the first floor of Dyce Academy on the night of 18 February 2025. Around 60 firefighters attended the incident, which heavily damaged a small number of classrooms. Police Scotland are treating the fire as a deliberate act of arson. The school was closed for the remainder of the week, and reopened in phases on 24 and 25 February.

Working My Way Back to You

"Working My Way Back to You" is a song made popular by the Four Seasons in 1966 and the Spinners in 1979.
Written by Sandy Linzer and Denny Randell, the song was originally recorded by The Four Seasons in 1966, reaching No. 9 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100. In the UK Top 50 chart it spent three weeks – all at No. 50. It is the only hit to feature the group's arranger Charles Calello in the temporary role of bassist/bass vocalist, having replaced original member Nick Massi.
The lyrics tell about a man who cheated on his girlfriend. When she leaves, he realizes that he did love her and is very remorseful about his past actions. He vows to win her love back. It is in some ways a re-casting of the melody from their previous hit, "Let's Hang On!".
"Cash Box" described it as a "raunchy, blues-drenched ode about a love-sick fella who hopes to be re-united with his ex-gal," and said that it has "money-in-the-bank-sound."
The Spinners version.
In 1979, American soul and R&amp;B group the Spinners recorded "Working My Way Back to You" and added a new bridge composed by Michael Zager. Billed as a medley as "Working My Way Back to You/Forgive Me, Girl", this version was No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in April 1980. On the "Billboard" Hot 100 singles chart, the medley (released in December 1979 in the U.S.) peaked at the No. 2 position in March and April 1980 for two weeks, behind "Another Brick in the Wall" by Pink Floyd. The Spinners' version also made it to No. 6 on the Soul Singles chart and No. 8 on the disco/dance chart. The version of the Spinners was taken up in French by the Canadian singer Jean Nichol under the title "Je voudrais te retrouver" (I want to find you).
Boyzone version.
Irish boy band Boyzone released a cover version of "Working My Way Back to You" as their debut single in May 1994. The song reached No. 3 on the Irish Singles Chart. It is the only single of the group to feature Mikey Graham on lead vocals.
The band later recorded a French version in collaboration with Alliage. This French version of the track is credited as being a major turning point in the career of producer-songwriter Steve Mac. A lack of interest from the "usual producers" led to Polydor phoning up Mac and asking him to take on the role, and by doing so he effectively made a decisive progression from his early dance-pop singles to the mature balladry with which he has since made a very successful career.

Metaraminol

Metaraminol, also known as metaradrine and sold under the brand name Aramine among others, is a sympathomimetic medication which is used in the prevention and treatment of hypotension (low blood pressure), particularly as a complication of anesthesia. It is given by intramuscular or intravenous administration.
Side effects of metaraminol include reflex bradycardia among others. Metaraminol is a norepinephrine releasing agent and at high doses a α1-adrenergic receptor agonist with some β-adrenergic effect. It is a substituted amphetamine and is closely related to phenylpropanolamine, ephedrine, and oxilofrine.
Metaraminol was approved for medical use in the United States in September 1954.
Medical uses.
Metaraminol is given intravenously as either a bolus (often 0.5–1 mg doses) or as an infusion, usually via peripheral intravenous access. Metaraminol is commonly available as 10 mg in 1 mL, that requires dilution prior to administration (often made up to a 0.5 mg/mL solution), however pre-prepared syringes of metaraminol for bolus use for hypotension are also commonly available.
Metaraminol is also used in the treatment of priapism.
Pharmacology.
Pharmacodynamics.
The dominant mechanism of action for the vasopressor action of metaraminol is indirect, with metaraminol displacing norepinephrine from neuronal vesicles in order for the noradrenaline to exert these effects. Metaraminol at higher doses may have direct α-adrenergic agonist and β1-adrenergic agonist effects. However at doses common in clinical practice, the indirect α1-adrenergic effects predominate, such that reflex bradycardia is a common side effect.
Chemistry.
Metaraminol, also known as (1"R",2"S")-3,β-dihydroxy-α-methylphenethylamine or as (1"R",2"S")-3,β-dihydroxyamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. It is the (1"R",2"S")-enantiomer of "meta"-hydroxynorephedrine (3,β-dihydroxyamphetamine). The drug is closely related to phenylpropanolamine ((1"RS",2"SR")-β-hydroxyamphetamine; norephedrine), ephedrine ((1"R",2"S")-β-hydroxy-"N"-methylamphetamine), "para"-hydroxynorephedrine (4,β-dihydroxyamphetamine), and oxilofrine (4,β-dihydroxy-"N"-methylamphetamine).
The experimental log P of metaraminol is -0.27 and its predicted log P ranges from -0.59 to 0.07.
Metaraminol is used pharmaceutically as the bitartrate salt.
History.
Metaraminol was approved for medical use in the United States in September 1954.
Society and culture.
Names.
Metaraminol is the generic name of the medication and its and , while its is métaraminol and its is metaraminolo. As the bitartrate salt, its generic name is metaraminol bitartrate and this is its and , while metaraminol tartrate is its . A synonym of metaraminol is metaradrine. Brand names of metaraminol include Aramin, Aramine, and Pressonex, among others.

Formes fixes

The formes fixes (; singular: forme fixe, "fixed form") are the three 14th- and 15th-century French poetic forms: the "ballade", "rondeau", and "virelai". Each was also a musical form, generally a "chanson", and all consisted of a complex pattern of repetition of verses and a refrain with musical content in two main sections. 
All three forms can be found in 13th-century sources, but a 15th-century source gives Philippe de Vitry as their first composer while the first comprehensive repertory of these forms was written by Guillaume de Machaut. The "formes fixes" stopped being used in music around the end of the 15th century, although their influence continued (in poetry they, especially the rondeau, continued to be used).
Sometimes forms from other countries and periods are referred to as "formes fixes". These include the Italian 14th-century madrigal and later ballata and barzelletta, the German bar form, Spanish 13th-century cantiga, and the later canción, and villancico.
