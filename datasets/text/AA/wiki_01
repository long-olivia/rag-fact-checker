Friendship, Indiana

Friendship is an unincorporated community (village) on State Road 62, (Chief White Eye Trail) Brown Township, Ripley County, in the U.S. state of Indiana.
History.
There are multiple stories about how Friendship obtained its name, the following are a couple of stories.
Originally named Paul Town after Daniel F. Paul, an early settler who opened a general store in his residence. The village's mail was being sent to Ballstown in Ripley County, Indiana, the village was then renamed to Hart's Mill after the Harts, William, Robert, and Hiram. Using this name the village's mail was being sent to Hartsville, in Decatur County, IN. The townspeople then decided upon Friendship, after the “Friendship Lodge” The Masonic Lodge F.&amp; A.M. #68 (smith p. 59).
On February 3, 1837, a post office named Harts Mill was established, with Hiram A. Hart as the first postmaster. On July 5, 1849, William Hart laid out the village, and establish the settlement's name for his family. On January 14, 1868, Friendship was the new name for the post office. WPA files state that the postmaster thought that the locals were quietly friendly, although others say it was so named because Friendship built the settlement.
Tourism and events.
Twice a year, the National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association holds major shoots in the community. During the months of June and September (2nd full weekend through the 3rd full weekend), to coincide with the NMLRA shoots, Friendship hosts Indiana's most distinctive open-air flea market event. Vendors from around the country, but especially from the "tri-state" area of Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana participate. The flea market is in two sections, one in town and the other on the other side of the Walter Cline gun range.
Laughery Creek offers open access to kayaking, tubing, canoeing, and fishing (with Indiana fishing license).
The National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association (NMLRA), established in 1933, offers camping, and shooting range (with membership). The NMLRA also owns the Rand House Museum in John Linsey Rand House.
Friendship is home to many historical buildings and organizations. The only remaining church in Friendship, The Bear Creek Baptist Church held the first service on July 2, 1818. Lot number seven in Friendship is the building and location of an earlier church, the building is now privately owned. This building was the Friendship Methodist Church, established in 1848, when this church dissolved the brick building was sold to St. Peter's Lutheran Church in 1877, and held services until 1931 
The Methodist/Lutheran Church was also the school until a schoolhouse was built on lot number 32 (now a private residence). This brick building was the school until 1915, the town then constructed a new school building at the west end of town, the building is now apartments.
Friendship Grocery occupies an early 19th century building that has been a general store and part of Friendship, IN for generations.
On state road 62 between The Bear Creek Baptist Church and The Rand house the remains the stone pillar of an old swinging bridge across Laughery Creek.
On the west side of town, on Olean Road, is Friendship's Raccoon Creek Stone Arch Bridge, which was constructed in 1899, and is still in use today.
The Friendship State Bank, founded in 1912, still calls Friendship home, though the building has had multiple additions and renovations over the years, it still stands in the original location.
The Friendship Volunteer Fire Department established in 1914. Friendship housed the fire engine in a private residence until, 1946, when a new fire hall was built, additions and renovations were done in 1961 and in 1978. The Fire Department constructed a new fire hall, west of town on Cave Hill Road in 1993.
In 1921 Tim Corson and Edw. Westmeyer built the garage in Friendship on Main Street (state road 62). Today the garage is running in the same building as Mac's Auto Service.
Friendship Tavern and Restaurant established in 1932, though the business has exchanged hands many times, it is still operating on Main Street in Friendship.
Carl Dyer Moccasins was established in the 1920s and relocated to Friendship in 1982, located with The Basket Man on Main Street next to The Bear Creek Baptist Church.

Hult Healey

Hult Healey was a make of kit cars in Sweden started when Mats Svanberg from Hult saw an Austin-Healey (100 or 3000) and fell in love with it. In the 1970s he bought one and in 1981 it was due for a renovation and he wanted to make a replica of the competition Austin-Healey, but without ruining his original car, so he decided to build a copy. He called in his friend Lennart Waerme to help him. The chassis was based on the original, but used engine, gearbox, front end and rear axle from a 1972 Volvo 142. To make this possible the car had to be made 14 cm wider than the original. The Hult Healey, as it was known, was first registered in the late summer of 1984. They also started to make kits based on their design. Up to 1990 they had made and sold 35 kit cars, and four complete cars.
In 1987 they made an update Mk2 model with a more racing design using a Volvo B23 engine giving . The body weighed just . Only three Mk2 Hult Healys were made.

Gpsd

gpsd is a computer software program that collects data from a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and provides the data via an Internet Protocol (IP) network to potentially multiple client applications in a server-client application architecture. Gpsd may be run as a daemon to operate transparently as a background task of the server. The network interface provides a standardized data format for multiple concurrent client applications, such as Kismet or GPS navigation software.
Gpsd is commonly used on Unix-like operating systems. It is distributed as free software under the 2-clause BSD license.
Design.
gpsd provides a TCP/IP service by binding to port 2947 by default. It communicates via that socket by accepting commands, and returning results. These commands use a JSON-based syntax and provide JSON responses. Multiple clients can access the service concurrently.
The application supports many types of GPS receivers with connections via serial ports, USB, and Bluetooth. Starting in 2009, gpsd also supports AIS receivers.
gpsd supports interfacing with the Network Time Protocol (NTP) server ntpd via shared memory to enable setting the host platform's time via the GPS clock.
Authors.
gpsd was originally written by Remco Treffkorn with Derrick Brashear, then maintained by Russell Nelson. It is now maintained by Eric S. Raymond.

Global distribution system

A global distribution system (GDS) is a computerised network system owned or operated by a company that enables transactions between travel industry service providers, mainly airlines, hotels, car rental companies, and travel agencies. The GDS mainly uses "real-time inventory" (e.g. number of hotel rooms available, number of flight seats available, or number of cars available) from the service providers. Travel agencies traditionally relied on GDS for services, products and rates in order to provide travel-related services to the end consumers. Thus, a GDS can link services, rates and bookings consolidating products and services across all three travel sectors: i.e., airline reservations, hotel reservations, car rentals.
GDS is different from a computer reservation system, which is a reservation system used by the service providers (also known as vendors). Primary customers of GDS are travel agents (both online and office-based) who make reservations on various reservation systems run by the vendors. GDS holds no inventory; the inventory is held on the vendor's reservation system itself. A GDS system will have a real-time link to the vendor's database. For example, when a travel agency requests a reservation on the service of a particular airline company, the GDS system routes the request to the appropriate airline's computer reservations system.
Example of a booking facilitation done by an airline GDS.
A mirror image of the passenger name record (PNR) in the airline reservations system is maintained in the GDS system. If a passenger books an itinerary containing air segments of multiple airlines through a travel agency, the passenger name record in the GDS system would hold information on their entire itinerary, while each airline they fly on would only have a portion of the itinerary that is relevant to them. This would contain flight segments on their own services and inbound and onward connecting flights (known as info segments) of other airlines in the itinerary. For example, if a passenger books a journey from Amsterdam to London on KLM, London to New York on British Airways, and New York to Frankfurt on Lufthansa through a travel agent and if the travel agent is connected to Amadeus GDS, the PNR in the Amadeus GDS would contain the full itinerary, while the PNR in KLM would show the Amsterdam to London segment along with the British Airways flight as an onward info segment. Likewise, the PNR in the Lufthansa system would show the New York to Frankfurt segment with the British Airways flight as an arrival information segment. Finally, the PNR in British Airways' system would show all three segments, one as a live segment and the other two as arrival and onward info segments.
Some GDS systems also have a dual-use capability for hosting multiple computer reservation systems; in such situations functionally the computer reservations system and the GDS partition of the system behave as if they were separate systems.
Mid-office travel automation.
Mid-office automation captures Passenger name record technically abbreviated as PNR data from a variety of global distribution systems (Sabre, Galileo, Amadeus, and Worldspan) sources and lets travel agencies create custom business rules to validate reservation accuracy, monitor travel policies, perform file finishing, prepare itineraries/invoices and process ticketing.
Quality control software is used for such functions as ensuring reservations are formatted properly, checking for lower fares and watching for seat availability, upgrades, waitlist clearance, and taking advantage of back to back ticketing opportunities. When customized, such tools allow agencies and corporate accounts to monitor virtually any information in global distribution system passenger name records. Accelerating such tools also creates opportunities for customer relationship management. (a)
Mid-office automation is key to increasing the touchless rate of online adoption.
Future of GDS systems and companies.
Global distribution systems in the travel industry originated from a traditional legacy business model that existed to inter-operate between airline vendors and travel agents. During the early days of computerized reservations systems flight ticket reservations were not possible without a GDS. As time progressed, many airline vendors (including budget and mainstream operators) have now adopted a strategy of 'direct selling' to their wholesale and retail customers (passengers). They invested heavily in their own reservations and direct-distribution channels and partner systems. This helps to minimize direct dependency on GDS systems to meet sales and revenue targets and allows for a more dynamic response to market needs. These technology advancements in this space facilitate an easier way to cross-sell to partner airlines and via travel agents, eliminating the dependency on a dedicated global GDS federating between systems. Also, multiple price comparison websites eliminate the need of dedicated GDS for point-in-time prices and inventory for both travel agents and end-customers. Hence some experts argued that these changes in business models might have led to the complete phasing out of GDS in the Airline space by the year 2020. On the other hand, some travel professional experts demonstrate that GDS still continue to offer the flexibility and bulk buying capacities for airline consolidators to reach travel agents that individual airline systems are not able to provide customer segments with wider choices. Their argument is, individual airline distribution systems are not designed to interoperate with competitors systems.
Lufthansa Group announced in June 2015 that it was imposing an additional charge of €16 when booking through an external global distribution system rather than their own systems. They stated their choice was based upon that the costs of using external systems was several times higher than their own. Several other airlines including Air France–KLM and Emirates Airline also stated that they are following the development.
However, hotels and car rental industry continue to benefit from GDS, especially last-minute inventory disposal using GDS to bring additional operational revenue. GDS here is useful to facilitate global reach using existing network and low marginal costs when compared to online air travel bookings. Some GDS companies are also in the process of investing and establishing significant offshore capability in a move to reduce costs and improve their profit margins to serve their customer directly accommodating changing business models.

Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (book)

Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (1968) is Pauline Kael's second collection of reviews from 1965 through 1968, compiled from numerous magazines including "The Atlantic", "Holiday", "The New Yorker", "Life", "Mademoiselle", "The New Republic", "McCall's", and "Vogue". It features her review of "The Sound of Music", which she notoriously dubbed "The Sound of Money," sparking outrage from loyal readers of "McCall's". This is erroneously considered to be the reason why she was fired from her short-lived position as their film critic. The book also features a smaller collection of synopses (as opposed to full-length reviews) of little-known movies, some of which are also printed in Kael's "5001 Nights at the Movies".
In her note on the title which begins the book, Kael asserts that these words are "perhaps the briefest statement imaginable of the basic appeal of movies. This appeal is what attracts us, and ultimately what makes us despair when we begin to understand how seldom movies are more than this." The title itself is a reference to the character of James Bond, who was often referred to as "Mr Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" in international markets; the original theme song for the 1965 Bond film "Thunderball" was to have had this title.
The book has gone out-of-print in the United States, but is still published in the United Kingdom by the independent publishing company Marion Boyars Publishers.

The Forgotten (1973 film)

The Forgotten (also known as Don't Look in the Basement and Death Ward #13) is a 1973 independent horror film directed by S. F. Brownrigg, written by Tim Pope and starring Bill McGhee, former Playboy model Rosie Holotik, and Annabelle Weenick (credited as Anne MacAdams) about homicidal patients at an insane asylum.
Plot.
Stephens Sanitarium is a secluded rural mental health institute whose chief doctor, Dr. Stephens, believes that the best way to cure insanity is to allow the patients to act out their realities freely. After a patient threatens her life, an elderly nurse decides to retire. Meanwhile, in the process of therapy (chopping wood with an axe), Oliver W. Cameron, the crazed former magistrate known as Judge, lands the axe into Stephens's back, apparently killing him. The nurse finishes packing and is attacked by Harriett, a patient who accuses her of stealing her "baby" (a plastic doll). The patient kills her by crushing her head in the nurse's suitcase.
The only remaining doctor appears to be Geraldine Masters, who vows to continue Dr. Stephens's work. Later, she is greeted by Charlotte Beale, a young nurse who reveals that Dr. Stephens hired her a week before. Masters allows her to settle in. Charlotte meets the patients, including a lobotomized and child-like man named Sam, who enjoys popsicles and his toy boat, a schizophrenic nymphomaniac named Allyson, an emotionally dependent woman named Jennifer, an octogenarian named Mrs. Callingham who spouts poetry and mistakes flowers in the garden for her children, juvenile prankster Danny, a shellshocked Sergeant who lost his mind after accidentally killing his men in Vietnam, and the judge.
Later, a telephone man investigates the faulty phone system at the institution. Callingham's tongue is cut out of her mouth during her sleep. However, Masters tells Charlotte that Callingham did it to herself. After he disobeys her, Masters burns the Sergeant's hand and later murders Jennifer for stealing medicine. Sam discovers the telephone man dead in a closet and tells Allyson. Allyson is distraught, as she thought that the man would marry her. Allyson reveals Masters' secret to Charlotte: Masters is a patient at the institute whom Stephens allowed to pretend to be a doctor. Masters presumably murdered the telephone man to ensure that he would not report the institution. Callingham indicates to Charlotte that it was Masters who cut out her tongue, apparently to prevent the elderly woman from disclosing the secret. Later, the Judge reveals that they all know Masters is a patient, but also think that Charlotte is one.
Allyson confronts Masters about the murder of the telephone man, saying that Charlotte now knows what is going on. During the confrontation, she implies that Masters used to be a real doctor, but was fired after killing a patient; this psychotic break led to her being institutionalized. Charlotte realizes that her life is in danger and tries to escape but finds that all the windows and doors have been boarded up by Masters. Allyson later convinces herself that the man is still alive and drags his body to her room to have sex with it. Masters commands the Judge to reveal Charlotte's location. The Judge instead says that he and the other patients have found Masters guilty and that she is no longer in charge.
Sam then leads Charlotte to the basement, where a man grabs her ankle, and she responds by beating him to death with a toy boat. She realizes that it is Stephens, but not before finishing him off. At the direction of Masters, Sam leads Charlotte upstairs. Sam thinks that Charlotte intentionally murdered Stephens and helps restrain her. However, he has a flashback from his lobotomy (with which Masters assisted) and rescues Charlotte by taking her out of the room. Masters cowers in a corner when Sam leaves, and the other patients enter with weapons and kill her. Sam leads Charlotte outside through a passage in the basement. Charlotte pleads for Sam to escape with her, but he returns inside to the room with the other patients. Disturbed by the murder scene, Sam grabs the axe and kills all the other inmates except Callingham, who is not in the room. Charlotte listens to the massacre outside and then flees. Sam leaves the room to get a popsicle and begins to cry.
Release.
Theatrical Release.
The original theatrical release of the film was in May 1973, when it played the Midwest and Southwest regions of the United States under the original title. Shortly thereafter, the film was acquired for theatrical distribution by Hallmark Releasing, a sub-distributor for American International Pictures located in the New England area. Hallmark had great success with "The Last House on the Left", particularly with the tag line "To avoid fainting, keep repeating: it's only a movie...only a movie...only a movie". In July 1973, they test-marketed the film under a number of new titles, including "The Snake Pit", "Beyond Help", and "Death Ward No. 13", before settling on "Don't Look In The Basement". The movie received a nationwide release under this title in August 1973, and Hallmark continued to program the film throughout the remainder of the 1970s, often issuing it as part of double or triple bills with other titles such as "The Last House on the Left", "The House That Vanished", and "Let Sleeping Corpses Lie", which Hallmark released in the US as "Don't Open the Window".
Home media.
"The Forgotten" was released for the first time on DVD by Vci Video on January 25, 2000. It was later released by BCI on January 22, 2002, as a part of its two-disk "Evil Places" movie pack. BCI would later re-release the film in 2004 and in 2005 in various multi-movie packs. The film was released five separate times in 2003 by Diamond Entertainment, Platinum Disc, Pop Flix, and Alpha Video respectively. In 2004, it was released twice by St. Clair Entertainment on February 24, and March 2.

In 2005, Platinum Disk re-released the film three separate times as a part of various multi-film packs. That same year, it would also be released by Stax, Mill Creek Entertainment, Black Horse, and re-released by Diamond Entertainment. The following year saw the film's re-release by both Mill Creek and Vci, as a part of several multi-movie collections. Mill Creek would once again re-release the film in 2007, as a double-feature alongside "Don't Open the Door!" (1975). It was released both as a single feature by Video International in 2008 and as a part of a five-disk movie pack by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment in 2010. Echo Bridge would include the film the following year along with Madacy Home Video in several multi-film collections. In 2012, the film was released by Film Chest and re-released by Pop Flix on January 24, and April 10, respectively. Mill Creek re-released the film one more time in 2013, for their three-disk "American Horror Stories: 12 Movie Collection". In 2014 Film Chest re-released a digitally restored version of the film in November. Film Chest then released the film on December 16, the following month. In 2015, the film was released as a single feature by VFN and by Films Around The World Inc. On October 25, 2016, it was released by VCI and the following month by Film Detective. It was released for the first time on Blu-ray by Brink in a double-feature, alongside its sequel "Don't Look in the Basement 2" (2015). 2018 saw the film's releases on both Blu-ray and DVD by Code Red and VCI.
UK release.
Under the title "Don't Look In The Basement", the film was released to UK cinemas in 1977. It was passed with an 'X' certificate after 35s of cuts (possibly made by the distributor prior to submission to the BBFC). In February 1983, the film was released on video by Dudley-based distributors Derann, under their Crystal sub-label. The running time was truncated to less than 80 minutes; still, it was branded as a Video Nasty, and though it escaped prosecution, was effectively a 'banned' title. The film was passed uncut with a '15' certificate for DVD release in 2005.
Reception.
Critical reception for "The Forgotten" has been mixed to negative.
Dave Sindelar on his film review website "Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings" gave the film a mixed review. In his review on the film Sindelar criticized the film's premise, calling it "hard to swallow" and the unnecessary nastiness of film's climax. However, Sindelar also wrote, "Nonetheless, the characters are quite interesting, and the acting from the cast of unknowns is excellent for such a low-budget movie, and there are enough moments sprinkled throughout the movie that show a sense of real sadness and a sense of humanity that give a greater texture to the proceedings. Ultimately, the strong points make the movie work, and I can appreciate it well enough, even if it does remain in that realm of movies that are simply not much fun for me."
Rob Gonsalves from ‘’eFilmCritic.com’’ awarded the film one out of five stars, calling it “a grade-Z horror flick”.
Cavett Binion of AllMovie gave it a generally favorable review, writing, "somehow the intrinsic sleaziness generated by the threadbare production manages to lend it a remarkably suitable ambience."
TV Guide gave the film a positive review, writing, “Despite the overall cheapness of the production, director S.F. Brownrigg does manage to convey a sense of seedy claustrophobia during the depraved proceedings.” Almar Haflidason from BBC gave the film three out of five stars. While it was omitted from Phil Hardy's "The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror", replaced with a review for "Don't Look Now", the earlier edition, "The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies" (Harper &amp; Row, 1986) provided a favorable review: "What lifts the film out of the usual run of asylum movies is its creation of a claustrophobic, hermetically sealed world and a powerfully unremitting ambience of craziness. Added to this are the inmates themselves, each hopelessly enmeshed in with their own obsessions and unable to communicate with the outside world but each also representing distinctly recognizable, identifiable, facets of humanity, though seen through a frighteningly distorting prism -- the judge consumed with guilt, the man who believes he is an army sergeant, a girl whose maternal feelings become fixated on a doll and so on."
Legacy.
Remake.
In May 2008, a remake of the film was being planned by directors Alan Rowe Kelly and Anthony G. Sumner. Filming was scheduled for October 2008 in Indiana with a planned 2009 release, but this version never came to fruition.
In March 2017, former horror punk guitarist from the Misfits, Doyle Wolfgang Von Frankenstein, was cast in "Death Ward 13", a remake and continuation of "Don't Look in the Basement", to be directed by Todd Nunes ("All Through the House") and produced by The Readmond Company. The second planned remake has not yet come to fruition.
Sequel.
In December 2013, a sequel titled "Id: Don't Look in the Basement 2" was announced with Anthony Brownrigg, son of S.F. Brownrigg, directing. The film was shot in Texas in March/April 2014 and used several of the same locations from the original film. The sequel was eventually released in 2015.

Volcán Santo Tomás (original indigenous name Qaqpekul) is a stratovolcano in southern Guatemala. Its highest point lies at an altitude of 3,542 m (11,621 ft) above sea level.
It is also known as "Volcán Pecul", or as "Cerro Zunil", the name of its youngest and most prominent dome which was last active approximately 84,000 years ago (K-Ar dating).
Geothermal activity can be observed in the form of Solfataras and thermal springs which are located on the west of the ridge between Santo Tomás and Zunil.

My New Best Friend

My New Best Friend was a hidden camera comedy game show that aired on Channel 4 from 8 August to 12 September 2003. It was hosted by Marc Wootton.
Format.
The idea was a hidden camera show where a member of the public would enter into an agreement to be filmed for a whole weekend with the task of convincing their friends and family that a character being played by Marc Wootton was their new best friend. Their reward was a prize of £10,000. What made the game difficult was Marc's character constantly embarrassing them in front of their family and friends to extreme levels, but they had to agree and go along with everything he said. Marc Wootton's characters were chosen for different episodes to make them as different from the contestant as possible to make it difficult for their friends and family to be convinced.
Once they have made it through the weekend the cameras capture the moment where Marc gives them the money and leaves the scene. The contestant is left to explain to their friends and family that the whole situation was a TV game show to win £10,000.

J. Edward Snyder

Rear Adm. J. Edward Snyder, USN (Ret.) (October 23, 1924 – November 4, 2007) was notable as the captain of the battleship USS "New Jersey" during that ship's deployment to the Vietnam War in 1968. Considered by those serving on the "New Jersey" to be a "sailor's captain," Captain Snyder was able to motivate his men through his more relaxed shipboard policies.
Snyder was also known for his wry sense of humor. While deployed off Vietnam, the USS New Jersey encountered a small US Navy ship. Fearing that the unidentified vessel was a North Vietnamese gunboat, the commanding officer of the smaller ship flashed a message to the "New Jersey" using its signal lamp, ordering the battleship to identify itself or be fired upon. In response, Snyder ordered that the largest signal lamp aboard be used to identify the ship and relay the message, replete with pun, "OPEN FIRE WHEN READY. FEAR GOD. DREADNOUGHT."
Snyder also sought to cultivate a wider sense of mission. He brought ground troops aboard the "New Jersey" for weekend liberty, earning the ship the nickname "The New Jersey Hilton." Told to stop the "unauthorized public relations stunt" by DoD, Snyder sternly responded, noting that he had notified the Pentagon, and that it was no stunt. Instead, it was meant to give the ground troops a respite from the war, and remind his men why they were providing gunfire support. He finished his message by disparaging the Pentagon as "Disneyland East," and stating that he had no idea what was going on there, but couldn't care less.
Captain Snyder died on Sunday, November 4, 2007, from pancreatic cancer.

Stony Kill Falls

Stony Kill Falls is the site of one of many access points to the Delaware Aqueduct. It is located in the town of Wawarsing, on the northwestern edge of the Minnewaska Preserve on land acquired in 2001 by the State of New York, The Open Space Institute and the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference from Napanoch Sand and Gravel Company that once owned the land. Long a little known back entrance into the Minnewaska Preserve, utilized by curiosity seekers and more experienced mountaineers, as a more convenient access point to Stony Kill Falls. The area only provides access to Stony Kill Falls, no other trails are allowed to be accessed from this area. Parking is not permitted on town roads.
Hiking guide.
From the parking area walk East along a gravel woods road into an open clearing. On the left and right views begin to open. Steep cliffs are visible on the left and right as you continue further along the path. The higher section of the clearing features the fenced in shaft, a deep water valve, running hundreds of feet below the earth to the Delaware Aqueduct, one of the major sources of water for New York City. On the right is an aging helipad, possible utilized as a quick access point for repairs to the Aqueduct. Continuing along the woods road the path dips down into an expansive gravel pit. Care is needed in this area as the shale is loose and sure footing is not guaranteed. Cast iron bars and solid chunks of limestone, shale, and granite litter the area. There are steep embankments all along the left side of the gravel pit. Closer inspection of the gaps in the embankment find a view nearly 60 feet down to the bed of the Stony Kill Creek. Use caution as the embankment becomes very thin and should not be walked upon, especially in wet weather as it is slowly falling into the Stony Kill and the gravel pit.
Technical information.
Stony Kill Falls is 87 feet high and one of the highest in the Minnewaska Preserve. Leaving the base of the falls and returning to the main trail the path ascends the side of the valley slowly gaining elevation. As it nears the top there is a 30-foot cascade near the side of the trail. Linking up with the Stony Kill Carriage Way at 1550 feet, the trail angles due west to the top of Stony Kill Falls. Views are expansive from the top of the falls, looking East, one can view the Stony Creek and Rondout Valleys. On a clear day there are views as far as Sullivan County.

Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan

"Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan" (1968), by J. G. Ballard, is a short story written in the style of a scientific report on a series of experiments intended to measure the psychosexual appeal of the Californian politician Ronald Reagan, who then was governor of the state of California, and also a candidate for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination, which he lost to Richard Nixon.
First published as a pamphlet in 1968 by the Unicorn Bookshop in Brighton, the short story was later republished in "The Atrocity Exhibition" (1970), a collection of thematically related short stories. It was later used as part of a prank at the 1980 Republican National Convention, at which Reagan was nominated as president.
History.
In the preface to the 1990 edition of "The Atrocity Exhibition" (1970), the novelist J.G. Ballard said that he was impressed and inspired by the phenomenon of "media politicians" who speak for private interests, whilst pretending to speak for the public interest, because:
A bookseller who sold the pamphlet-edition of the short story “Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan” was charged with the crime of public obscenity. In 1970, the Doubleday publishing house included the pamphlet edition as an appendix to the first U.S. edition of "The Atrocity Exhibition", which is a collection of thematically related short stories and condensed novels.
Moreover, at the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit, Michigan, as a political prank, ex-Situationists distributed a copy of the short story “Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan”, the cover of which was decorated with the official seal of the Republican Party in order to impress and deceive the delegates of the report's documentary credibility. Ballard said that the political delegates readily accepted the short-story fiction for what it resembled: a scientific report about the psychological dynamics of the subliminal appeal of the "media politician" Ronald Reagan who was proffering himself as a Republican candidate for the national presidency.

SMJK San Min

Sekolah Menengah Jenis Kebangsaan San Min (Chinese: 三民国民型华文中学，abbreviated as SMJK San Min or SMSM), which literally translates to San Min National Type Chinese Secondary School (or simply San Min Secondary School), is located in Teluk Intan in Perak, Malaysia. It was first established in 1929 and has since survived the many changes and hardships, including the Japanese Occupation. It was then classified as a National Type Secondary School after the enforcement of the Malaysian Education Act 1957. It was first located beside Jalan Woo Saik Hong in the town area. In 1998, after receiving a plot of land from a generous Indian donor, the school had then moved to its current location beside Jalan Merbok (formerly Jalan Brewster) off Jalan Sultan Abdullah.
The name.
The Name of the school is believed to have originated from Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People (Chinese:三民主义). The Three Principles of the People can also be found in part of the school anthem, "兴民族兮，树民权兮，兴民生责任" (Literal translation: Live nationalism, build democracy, and live social responsibility).
History.
Being the only National Type Secondary School in Hilir Perak, the school one of the hundred-odd secondary schools in Malaysia which enlist Chinese and Chinese Literature subject in their standard timetable. Prior to moving to the current location, the school compound was small and was in a deplorable condition. It was only able to provide secondary education up to PMR level. After moving to the current location, it started SPM classes and the school is now one of the biggest school in Teluk Intan with about 2,000 students.

Joe McKelvey

Joseph McKelvey (17 June 1898 – 8 December 1922) was an Irish Republican Army officer who was executed during the Irish Civil War without trial or court martial. He participated in the Anti-Treaty IRA's repudiation of the authority of the Dáil Éireann, the civil government of the Irish Republic declared in 1919 in March 1922, and was elected to the IRA Army Council as Deputy Chief of Staff. In April 1922, he helped command the occupation of the Four Courts in defiance of the new Irish Free State. This action helped to spark the civil war, between pro- and anti-treaty factions. McKelvey was among the most hardline of the republican side and, briefly in June 1922, became IRA Chief of Staff (Four Courts).
Background.
McKelvey was born in Stewartstown, County Tyrone, the only son of Patrick McKelvey, a Royal Irish Constabulary constable who later became a sergeant, and Rose O'Neill, a post office employee. During World War I, McKelvey Snr enlisted in the special reserve of the British Army and, in 1917, was posted to the Northumberland Fusiliers. He died in 1919 in Belfast, due to a perforation of his stomach, at the age of 57.
Joe McKelvey had a keen interest in the Gaelic Athletic Association and the Irish language. He studied as an accountant and gained some of the qualifications necessary for this profession, but never fully qualified. He worked for a time at the Income Tax Office on Queen's Square in Belfast and later found work in the city's engineering industry with Mackies on the Springfield road. He joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Irish Volunteers, which during 1919 became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
He was a founder member of the O'Donovan Rossa Club, Belfast – established in 1916 on the Falls Road. Each year the club honour him with a juvenile hurling blitz, an invitational competition which is participated in by clubs throughout Ireland.
War of Independence.
McKelvey participated in the Irish War of Independence 1919–1921 against the British, in which he commanded the IRA's 1st Battalion, Belfast Brigade. In July 1920, during a wave of violence in the wake of the IRA assassination of a northern police inspector (Gerard Smyth) in Cork, McKelvey was expelled from his job by loyalist intimidation. Roughly 7,000 other Catholics and left-wing Protestant political activists also lost their jobs in this manner at the time. Many of these unemployed Catholics were later recruited into the IRA. McKelvey later wrote to the IRA leadership that 75% of his volunteers were unemployed. During this time McKelvey's men defended Catholics areas during attacks on Belfast's Catholic minority. These attacks became known as the Belfast pogroms. On 22 August 1920, McKelvey helped to organise the killing of RIC Detective Oswald Swanzy in Lisburn. The killing itself was carried out by IRA men from Cork, but McKelvey arranged a taxi to carry the assassins to and from the scene and disposed of their weapons. In reprisal for this shooting, 300 Catholic homes in Lisburn were burned out (see The Troubles in Ulster (1920–1922)). McKelvey was forced to lie low in Dublin for some time after these events.
In March 1921, the IRA was re-organised by GHQ into divisions, and McKelvey was appointed commander of the Third Northern Division, responsible for Belfast and the surrounding area. McKelveys three brigades covered Belfast, County Antrim and north County Down. He was criticized by some of the younger, more radical Volunteers in the IRA Belfast Brigade (led by Roger McCorley), for being reluctant to sanction the killing of police and British Army personnel in Belfast. McKelvey feared (and was proved correct) that such actions would provoke retaliatory attacks on the Catholic and Irish nationalist community by loyalists. Nevertheless, he was unable to control some of his younger volunteers, who formed an "active service unit" on their own initiative and killed policemen and soldiers on a regular basis. When such attacks occurred, loyalists, generally supported by the Ulster Special Constabulary, attacked Catholic areas in reprisal. The IRA was then forced to try to defend Catholic areas, and McKelvey feared that the organisation was being drawn into sectarian conflict as opposed to what he saw as the "real" struggle for Irish independence. In May 1921, McKelvey's command suffered a severe setback when fifty of his best men were sent to County Cavan to train and link up with the IRA units there, only to be surrounded and captured by the British Army on Lappanduff hill on 9 May.
In most of Ireland, hostilities were ended with a truce declared on 11 July 1921. However, in the north and particularly in Belfast, violence intensified over the following year. McKelvey wrote to GHQ at this time that his command was very short of both arms and money. In March 1922, many of his papers, detailing the names and units of the roughly 1,000 IRA members in Belfast, were captured by the B-Specials in a raid on St Mary's Hall in Belfast.
Civil War.
McKelvey was alone among the leadership of the Belfast IRA in going against the acceptance of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Most of his comrades supported Michael Collins' assurances that, although the Treaty accepted the partition of Northern Ireland from the rest of the country, this was only a temporary concession which would be dealt with later. McKelvey did not accept this. As a result, he left his command as head of the IRA Third Northern Division and joined the republican side in Dublin. McKelvey was replaced by Seamus Woods as O/C of the Third Northern Division. Seamus Woods would go on to senior positions within the Free State Army.
McKelvey participated in the Anti-Treaty IRA's repudiation of the authority of the Dáil (civil government of the Irish Republic declared in 1919) in March 1922 and was elected to the IRA Executive. In April 1922, he helped command the occupation of the Four Courts in defiance of the new Irish Free State during the Irish Civil War, between pro- and anti-Treaty factions. For a period, McKelvey was IRA Chief of Staff (Four Courts).
On 28 June 1922, the new Irish Free State government shelled the Four Courts. The Republicans in the Four Courts surrendered after two days of fighting and McKelvey was captured. He was held for the following five months in Mountjoy Prison in Dublin, McKelvey was never tried or convicted of any offence.
Execution.
On 8 December 1922, Joe McKelvey was executed by firing squad along with three other imprisoned Anti-Treaty leaders, Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows and Richard Barrett. The executions had been explicitly ordered at a government cabinet meeting in reprisal for the Anti-Treaty IRA's murder of Seán Hales, a Pro-Treaty member of the Third Dáil. In 2011, the Irish government acknowledged that the executions that took place without trial were murder: "People who were murdered or executed without trial by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were murdered. It was an atrocity and those people killed without a trial by the first government were murdered."
On the morning of his execution, he wrote this letter to Mrs Isabella Sullivan (née Letson) of Walmer, Andersonstown, Belfast: Letter written by McKelvey to Mrs Sullivan, 8 December 1922. To his mother, he wrote, "My dearest, dearest mother, How can I tell you the news I have to let you know…" The four were killed at 9am in a badly botched execution commanded by Hugo MacNeill, nephew of Eoin MacNeill. The women prisoners in the wing overlooking the yard counted a volley followed by nine revolver shots. McKelvey was a well respected Irish Republican leader and many Pro-Treaty Officers and men took his execution very badly.

Harry Farjeon

Harry Farjeon (6 May 1878 – 29 December 1948) was a British composer and an influential teacher of harmony and composition at the Royal Academy of Music for more than 45 years.
Early life and studies.
Harry Farjeon was born in Hohokus Township, New Jersey, United States, the eldest son of author Benjamin Farjeon, who was from the East End of London, and Margaret, the daughter of American actor Joseph Jefferson. His parents returned to Britain when he was a baby, and he lived in Hampstead in London for the rest of his life. His younger sister, Eleanor Farjeon (b. 1881), with whom he shared a rich imaginary life, wrote children's books and poetry, including the hymn, "Morning Has Broken". His younger brothers were J. Jefferson Farjeon (b. 1883), novelist, and Herbert Farjeon (b. 1887), writer of theatrical revues.
Harry studied music privately with Landon Ronald and John Storer, then in 1895 he entered the Royal Academy of Music in London, where he studied composition with Battison Haynes and Frederick Corder, and piano with Septimus Webbe. There he was a contemporary of Arnold Bax, York Bowen, Adam Carse, Eric Coates, Benjamin Dale and Percy Hilder Miles. An opera, "Floretta", to a libretto by his sister, Eleanor, was produced at the Academy in 1899, and two operettas were performed at St George's Hall in 1901 and 1902.
Career in music.
Farjeon left the Royal Academy of Music in 1900, but in 1901 he returned to teach composition. Two years later, at the age of 25, he became the Academy's youngest ever professor, having become the family wage-earner after the death of his father. Among his many pupils were Mary Chandler (1911-1996), George Lloyd, Christian Darnton, Reginald King, Geraldine Mucha, Phyllis Tate, Daniel Jones and Steve Race. He also taught at the Blackheath Conservatoire.
Harry Farjeon composed music throughout most of his life. His compositions are mostly for piano (many grouped into suites and collections, some also published separately) with the illustrative pieces mostly intended to appeal to amateur home pianists. But he also wrote a piano sonata, chamber music (including four string quartets), full scale orchestral works and many separate songs, song cycles and dramatic works, often setting texts by his sister Eleanor. He also wrote about music for the "Daily Telegraph", the "Musical Times" and other periodicals.
On 3 September 1903 his Piano Concerto in D minor was performed at the Proms. His "Hans Andersen" suite for small orchestra was played with great success at a Patron's Fund concert of the Royal College of Music in 1905, and also played by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and elsewhere. The song cycle "The Lute of Jade", which sets classical Chinese poetry from the popular translations by Launcelot Cranmer-Byng, was premiered in July 1917 by the Welsh mezzo-soprano and composer Morfydd Owen at the Birkenhead National Eisteddfod. His "Phantasy Piano Concerto" and the "St. Dominic Mass" were both published as part of the Carnegie Collection of British Music in 1925 and 1926 respectively, and both were frequently performed.
In 1937 Farjeon's close friend, the pianist Eileen Joyce, recorded the "Tarantella in A minor" in what became one of her most successful gramophone records. It seems likely that he composed it especially for Joyce and gave her the manuscript, as it wasn't published and doesn't appear in any catalogue entries. The Christmas Masque "A Room at the Inn" (written by Herbert and Eleanor Farjeon with music by Harry Farjeon) was broadcast five times between 1932 and 1945. And on 10 July 1942 his symphonic poem "Pannychis" (inspired by Eleanor Farjeon's short story of the same name) was played at The Proms, conducted by Basil Cameron. Farjeon regarded the symphonic poem "Summer Vision" as his best work, but the score was sent to Germany shortly before World War I and was lost.
His eyesight had been bad since childhood, and it grew worse as he became older. His students wrote their compositions on specially printed brown paper. Steve Race has said that writing on this paper cured him of writing long rambling compositions. Farjeon taught at the Academy for 47 years, despite developing Parkinson's disease in later life. He was still teaching thirty students a week when, at the end of the July 1948 term, he fell and broke his hip. He died in Hampstead on 29 December 1948.

Algorithm characterizations

Algorithm characterizations are attempts to formalize the word algorithm. Algorithm does not have a generally accepted formal definition. Researchers are actively working on this problem. This article will present some of the "characterizations" of the notion of "algorithm" in more detail.
The problem of definition.
Over the last 200 years, the definition of the algorithm has become more complicated and detailed as researchers have tried to pin down the term. Indeed, there may be more than one type of "algorithm". But most agree that algorithm has something to do with defining generalized processes for the creation of "output" integers from other "input" integers – "input parameters" arbitrary and infinite in extent, or limited in extent but still variable—by the manipulation of distinguishable symbols (counting numbers) with finite collections of rules that a person can perform with paper and pencil.
The most common number-manipulation schemes—both in formal mathematics and in routine life—are: (1) the recursive functions calculated by a person with paper and pencil, and (2) the Turing machine or its Turing equivalents—the primitive register-machine or "counter-machine" model, the random-access machine model (RAM), the random-access stored-program machine model (RASP) and its functional equivalent "the computer".
When we are doing "arithmetic" we are really calculating by the use of "recursive functions" in the shorthand algorithms we learned in grade school, for example, adding and subtracting.
The proofs that every "recursive function" we can "calculate by hand" we can "compute by machine" and vice versa—note the usage of the words "calculate" versus "compute"—is remarkable. But this equivalence together with the "thesis" (unproven assertion) that this includes "every" calculation/computation indicates why so much emphasis has been placed upon the use of Turing-equivalent machines in the definition of specific algorithms, and why the definition of "algorithm" itself often refers back to "the Turing machine". This is discussed in more detail under Stephen Kleene's characterization.
The following are summaries of the more famous characterizations (Kleene, Markov, Knuth) together with those that introduce novel elements—elements that further expand the definition or contribute to a more precise definition.
Chomsky hierarchy.
There is more consensus on the "characterization" of the notion of "simple algorithm".
All algorithms need to be specified in a formal language, and the "simplicity notion" arises from the simplicity of the language. The Chomsky (1956) hierarchy is a containment hierarchy of classes of formal grammars that generate formal languages. It is used for classifying of programming languages and abstract machines.
From the "Chomsky hierarchy" perspective, if the algorithm can be specified on a simpler language (than unrestricted), it can be characterized by this kind of language, else it is a typical "unrestricted algorithm".
Examples: a "general purpose" macro language, like M4 is unrestricted (Turing complete), but the C preprocessor macro language is not, so any algorithm expressed in "C preprocessor" is a "simple algorithm".
See also Relationships between complexity classes.
Features of a good algorithm.
The following are desirable features of a well-defined algorithm, as discussed in Scheider and Gersting (1995):
Properties of specific algorithms that may be desirable include space and time efficiency, generality (i.e. being able to handle many inputs), or determinism.
1881 John Venn's negative reaction to W. Stanley Jevons's Logical Machine of 1870.
In early 1870 W. Stanley Jevons presented a "Logical Machine" (Jevons 1880:200) for analyzing a syllogism or other logical form e.g. an argument reduced to a Boolean equation. By means of what Couturat (1914) called a "sort of "logical piano" [,] ... the equalities which represent the premises ... are "played" on a keyboard like that of a typewriter. ... When all the premises have been "played", the panel shows only those constituents whose sum is equal to 1, that is, ... its logical whole. This mechanical method has the advantage over VENN's geometrical method..." (Couturat 1914:75).
For his part John Venn, a logician contemporary to Jevons, was less than thrilled, opining that "it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known "or likely to be discovered" really deserve the name of logical machines" (italics added, Venn 1881:120). But of historical use to the developing notion of "algorithm" is his explanation for his negative reaction with respect to a machine that "may subserve a really valuable purpose by enabling us to avoid otherwise inevitable labor":
He concludes that "I cannot see that any machine can hope to help us except in the third of these steps; so that it seems very doubtful whether any thing of this sort really deserves the name of a logical engine."(Venn 1881:119–121).
1943, 1952 Stephen Kleene's characterization.
This section is longer and more detailed than the others because of its importance to the topic: Kleene was the first to propose that "all" calculations/computations—of "every" sort, the "totality" of—can "equivalently" be (i) "calculated" by use of five "primitive recursive operators" plus one special operator called the mu-operator, or be (ii) "computed" by the actions of a Turing machine or an equivalent model.
Furthermore, he opined that either of these would stand as a definition of algorithm.
A reader first confronting the words that follow may well be confused, so a brief explanation is in order. "Calculation" means done by hand, "computation" means done by Turing machine (or equivalent). (Sometimes an author slips and interchanges the words). A "function" can be thought of as an "input-output box" into which a person puts natural numbers called "arguments" or "parameters" (but only the counting numbers including 0—the nonnegative integers) and gets out a single nonnegative integer (conventionally called "the answer"). Think of the "function-box" as a little man either calculating by hand using "general recursion" or computing by Turing machine (or an equivalent machine).
"Effectively calculable/computable" is more generic and means "calculable/computable by "some" procedure, method, technique ... whatever...". "General recursive" was Kleene's way of writing what today is called just "recursion"; however, "primitive recursion"—calculation by use of the five recursive operators—is a lesser form of recursion that lacks access to the sixth, additional, mu-operator that is needed only in rare instances. Thus most of life goes on requiring only the "primitive recursive functions."
1943 "Thesis I", 1952 "Church's Thesis".
In 1943 Kleene proposed what has come to be known as Church's thesis:
In a nutshell: to calculate "any" function the only operations a person needs (technically, formally) are the 6 primitive operators of "general" recursion (nowadays called the operators of the mu recursive functions).
Kleene's first statement of this was under the section title "12. Algorithmic theories". He would later amplify it in his text (1952) as follows:
This is not as daunting as it may sound – "general" recursion is just a way of making our everyday arithmetic operations from the five "operators" of the primitive recursive functions together with the additional mu-operator as needed. Indeed, Kleene gives 13 examples of primitive recursive functions and Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey add some more, most of which will be familiar to the reader—e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, exponentiation, the CASE function, concatenation, etc., etc.; for a list see Some common primitive recursive functions.
Why general-recursive functions rather than primitive-recursive functions?
Kleene et al. (cf §55 General recursive functions p. 270 in Kleene 1952) had to add a sixth recursion operator called the minimization-operator (written as μ-operator or mu-operator) because Ackermann (1925) produced a hugely growing function—the Ackermann function—and Rózsa Péter (1935) produced a general method of creating recursive functions using Cantor's diagonal argument, neither of which could be described by the 5 primitive-recursive-function operators. With respect to the Ackermann function:
But the need for the mu-operator is a rarity. As indicated above by Kleene's list of common calculations, a person goes about their life happily computing primitive recursive functions without fear of encountering the monster numbers created by Ackermann's function (e.g. super-exponentiation).
1952 "Turing's thesis".
Turing's Thesis hypothesizes the computability of "all computable functions" by the Turing machine model and its equivalents.
To do this in an effective manner, Kleene extended the notion of "computable" by casting the net wider—by allowing into the notion of "functions" both "total functions" and "partial functions". A "total function" is one that is defined "for all natural numbers" (positive integers including 0). A partial function is defined for "some" natural numbers but not all—the specification of "some" has to come "up front". Thus the inclusion of "partial function" extends the notion of function to "less-perfect" functions. Total- and partial-functions may either be calculated by hand or computed by machine.
We now observe Kleene's definition of "computable" in a formal sense:
Thus we have arrived at "Turing's Thesis":
Although Kleene did not give examples of "computable functions" others have. For example, Davis (1958) gives Turing tables for the Constant, Successor and Identity functions, three of the five operators of the primitive recursive functions:
Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002) give the following as prose descriptions of Turing machines for:
With regards to the counter machine, an abstract machine model equivalent to the Turing machine:
Demonstrations of computability by abacus machine (Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002)) and by counter machine (Minsky 1967):
The fact that the abacus/counter-machine models can simulate the recursive functions provides the proof that: If a function is "machine computable" then it is "hand-calculable by partial recursion". Kleene's Theorem XXIX :
The converse appears as his Theorem XXVIII. Together these form the proof of their equivalence, Kleene's Theorem XXX.
1952 Church–Turing Thesis.
With his Theorem XXX Kleene proves the "equivalence" of the two "Theses"—the Church Thesis and the Turing Thesis. (Kleene can only hypothesize (conjecture) the truth of both thesis – "these he has not proven"):
Thus by Kleene's Theorem XXX: either method of making numbers from input-numbers—recursive functions calculated by hand or computated by Turing-machine or equivalent—results in an ""effectively calculable/computable" function". If we accept the hypothesis that "every" calculation/computation can be done by either method equivalently we have accepted both Kleene's Theorem XXX (the equivalence) and the Church–Turing Thesis (the hypothesis of "every").
A note of dissent: "There's more to algorithm..." Blass and Gurevich (2003).
The notion of separating out Church's and Turing's theses from the "Church–Turing thesis" appears not only in Kleene (1952) but in Blass-Gurevich (2003) as well. But while there are agreements, there are disagreements too:
1954 A. A. Markov Jr.'s characterization.
Andrey Markov Jr. (1954) provided the following definition of algorithm:
He admitted that this definition "does not pretend to mathematical precision" (p. 1). His 1954 monograph was his attempt to define algorithm more accurately; he saw his resulting definition—his "normal" algorithm—as "equivalent to the concept of a recursive function" (p. 3). His definition included four major components (Chapter II.3 pp. 63ff):
In his Introduction Markov observed that "the entire significance for mathematics" of efforts to define algorithm more precisely would be "in connection with the problem of a constructive foundation for mathematics" (p. 2). Ian Stewart (cf Encyclopædia Britannica) shares a similar belief: "...constructive analysis is very much in the same algorithmic spirit as computer science...". For more see constructive mathematics and Intuitionism.
Distinguishability and Locality: Both notions first appeared with Turing (1936–1937) --
Locality appears prominently in the work of Gurevich and Gandy (1980) (whom Gurevich cites). Gandy's "Fourth Principle for Mechanisms" is "The Principle of Local Causality":
1936, 1963, 1964 Gödel's characterization.
1936: A rather famous quote from Kurt Gödel appears in a "Remark added in proof [of the original German publication] in his paper "On the Length of Proofs" translated by Martin Davis appearing on pp. 82–83 of "The Undecidable". A number of authors—Kleene, Gurevich, Gandy etc. -- have quoted the following:
1963: In a "Note" dated 28 August 1963 added to his famous paper "On Formally Undecidable Propositions" (1931) Gödel states (in a footnote) his belief that "formal systems" have "the characteristic property that reasoning in them, in principle, can be completely replaced by mechanical devices" (p. 616 in van Heijenoort). ". . . due to "A. M. Turing's work a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general notion of formal system can now be given [and] a completely general version of Theorems VI and XI is now possible." (p. 616). In a 1964 note to another work he expresses the same opinion more strongly and in more detail.
1964: In a Postscriptum, dated 1964, to a paper presented to the Institute for Advanced Study in spring 1934, Gödel amplified his conviction that "formal systems" are those that can be mechanized:
The * indicates a footnote in which Gödel cites the papers by Alan Turing (1937) and Emil Post (1936) and then goes on to make the following intriguing statement:
Church's definitions encompass so-called "recursion" and the "lambda calculus" (i.e. the λ-definable functions). His footnote 18 says that he discussed the relationship of "effective calculatibility" and "recursiveness" with Gödel but that he independently questioned "effectively calculability" and "λ-definability":
It would appear from this, and the following, that far as Gödel was concerned, the Turing machine was sufficient and the lambda calculus was "much less suitable." He goes on to make the point that, with regards to limitations on human reason, the jury is still out:
1967 Minsky's characterization.
Minsky (1967) baldly asserts that "an algorithm is "an effective procedure" and declines to use the word "algorithm" further in his text; in fact his index makes it clear what he feels about "Algorithm, "synonym" for Effective procedure"(p. 311):
Other writers (see Knuth below) use the word "effective procedure". This leads one to wonder: What is Minsky's notion of "an effective procedure"? He starts off with:
But he recognizes that this is subject to a criticism:
His refinement? To "specify, along with the statement of the rules, "the details of the mechanism that is to interpret them"". To avoid the "cumbersome" process of "having to do this over again for each individual procedure" he hopes to identify a "reasonably "uniform" family of rule-obeying mechanisms". His "formulation":
In the end, though, he still worries that "there remains a subjective aspect to the matter. Different people may not agree on whether a certain procedure should be called effective" (p. 107)
But Minsky is undeterred. He immediately introduces "Turing's Analysis of Computation Process" (his chapter 5.2). He quotes what he calls "Turing's "thesis""
After an analysis of "Turing's Argument" (his chapter 5.3)
he observes that "equivalence of many intuitive formulations" of Turing, Church, Kleene, Post, and Smullyan "...leads us to suppose that there is really here an 'objective' or 'absolute' notion. As Rogers [1959] put it:
1967 Rogers' characterization.
In his 1967 "Theory of Recursive Functions and Effective Computability" Hartley Rogers' characterizes "algorithm" roughly as "a clerical (i.e., deterministic, bookkeeping) procedure . . . applied to . . . symbolic "inputs" and which will eventually yield, for each such input, a corresponding symbolic "output""(p. 1). He then goes on to describe the notion "in approximate and intuitive terms" as having 10 "features", 5 of which he asserts that "virtually all mathematicians would agree [to]" (p. 2). The remaining 5 he asserts "are less obvious than *1 to *5 and about which we might find less general agreement" (p. 3).
The 5 "obvious" are:
The remaining 5 that he opens to debate, are:
1968, 1973 Knuth's characterization.
Knuth (1968, 1973) has given a list of five properties that are widely accepted as requirements for an algorithm:
Knuth offers as an example the Euclidean algorithm for determining the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers (cf. Knuth Vol. 1 p. 2).
Knuth admits that, while his description of an algorithm may be intuitively clear, it lacks formal rigor, since it is not exactly clear what "precisely defined" means, or "rigorously and unambiguously specified" means, or "sufficiently basic", and so forth. He makes an effort in this direction in his first volume where he defines "in detail" what he calls the "machine language" for his "mythical MIX...the world's first polyunsaturated computer" (pp. 120ff). Many of the algorithms in his books are written in the MIX language. He also uses tree diagrams, flow diagrams and state diagrams.
"Goodness" of an algorithm, "best" algorithms: Knuth states that "In practice, we not only want algorithms, we want "good" algorithms..." He suggests that some criteria of an algorithm's goodness are the number of steps to perform the algorithm, its "adaptability to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc." Given a number of algorithms to perform the same computation, which one is "best"? He calls this sort of inquiry "algorithmic analysis: given an algorithm, to determine its performance characteristcis" (all quotes this paragraph: Knuth Vol. 1 p. 7)
1972 Stone's characterization.
Stone (1972) and Knuth (1968, 1973) were professors at Stanford University at the same time so it is not surprising if there are similarities in their definitions (boldface added for emphasis):
Stone is noteworthy because of his detailed discussion of what constitutes an “effective” rule – his robot, or person-acting-as-robot, must have some information and abilities within them, and if not the information and the ability must be provided in "the algorithm":
Furthermore, "...not all instructions are acceptable, because they may require the robot to have abilities beyond those that we consider reasonable.” He gives the example of a robot confronted with the question is “Henry VIII a King of England?” and to print 1 if yes and 0 if no, but the robot has not been previously provided with this information. And worse, if the robot is asked if Aristotle was a King of England and the robot only had been provided with five names, it would not know how to answer. Thus:
After providing us with his definition, Stone introduces the Turing machine model and states that the set of five-tuples that are the machine's instructions are “an algorithm ... known as a Turing machine program” (p. 9). Immediately thereafter he goes on say that a “"computation" of a Turing machine is "described" by stating:
This precise prescription of what is required for "a computation" is in the spirit of what will follow in the work of Blass and Gurevich.
2000 Berlinski's characterization.
While a student at Princeton in the mid-1960s, David Berlinski was a student of Alonzo Church (cf p. 160). His year-2000 book "The Advent of the Algorithm: The 300-year Journey from an Idea to the Computer" contains the following definition of algorithm:
2000, 2002 Gurevich's characterization.
A careful reading of Gurevich 2000 leads one to conclude (infer?) that he believes that "an algorithm" is actually "a Turing machine" or "a pointer machine" doing a computation. An "algorithm" is not just the symbol-table that guides the behavior of the machine, nor is it just one instance of a machine doing a computation given a particular set of input parameters, nor is it a suitably programmed machine with the power off; rather "an algorithm is the machine actually doing any computation of which it is capable". Gurevich does not come right out and say this, so as worded above this conclusion (inference?) is certainly open to debate:
In Blass and Gurevich 2002 the authors invoke a dialog between "Quisani" ("Q") and "Authors" (A), using Yiannis Moshovakis as a foil, where they come right out and flatly state:
This use of the word "implementation" cuts straight to the heart of the question. Early in the paper, Q states his reading of Moshovakis:
But the authors waffle here, saying "[L]et's stick to "algorithm" and "machine", and the reader is left, again, confused. We have to wait until Dershowitz and Gurevich 2007 to get the following footnote comment:
2003 Blass and Gurevich's characterization.
Blass and Gurevich describe their work as evolved from consideration of Turing machines and pointer machines, specifically Kolmogorov-Uspensky machines (KU machines), Schönhage Storage Modification Machines (SMM), and linking automata as defined by Knuth. The work of Gandy and Markov are also described as influential precursors.
Gurevich offers a 'strong' definition of an algorithm (boldface added):
The above phrase computation as an evolution of the state differs markedly from the definition of Knuth and Stone—the "algorithm" as a Turing machine program. Rather, it corresponds to what Turing called "the complete configuration" (cf Turing's definition in Undecidable, p. 118) -- and includes "both" the current instruction (state) "and" the status of the tape. [cf Kleene (1952) p. 375 where he shows an example of a tape with 6 symbols on it—all other squares are blank—and how to Gödelize its combined table-tape status].
In Algorithm examples we see the evolution of the state first-hand.
1995 – Daniel Dennett: evolution as an algorithmic process.
Philosopher Daniel Dennett analyses the importance of evolution as an algorithmic process in his 1995 book "Darwin's Dangerous Idea". Dennett identifies three key features of an algorithm:
It is on the basis of this analysis that Dennett concludes that "According to Darwin, evolution is an algorithmic process". (p. 60).
However, in the previous page he has gone out on a much-further limb. In the context of his chapter titled "Processes as Algorithms", he states:
It is unclear from the above whether Dennett is stating that the physical world by itself and without observers is intrinsically algorithmic (computational) or whether a symbol-processing observer is what is adding "meaning" to the observations.
2002 John Searle adds a clarifying caveat to Dennett's characterization.
Daniel Dennett is a proponent of strong artificial intelligence: the idea that the logical structure of an algorithm is sufficient to explain mind. John Searle, the creator of the Chinese room thought experiment, claims that "syntax [that is, logical structure] is by itself not sufficient for semantic content [that is, meaning]" . In other words, the "meaning" of symbols is relative to the mind that is using them; an algorithm—a logical construct—by itself is insufficient for a mind.
Searle cautions those who claim that algorithmic (computational) processes are intrinsic to nature (for example, cosmologists, physicists, chemists, etc.):
2002: Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey specification of Turing machine calculation.
An example in Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) (pp. 31–32) demonstrates the precision required in a complete specification of an algorithm, in this case to add two numbers: m+n. It is similar to the Stone requirements above.
(i) They have discussed the role of "number format" in the computation and selected the "tally notation" to represent numbers:
(ii) At the outset of their example they specify the machine to be used in the computation as a Turing machine. They have previously specified (p. 26) that the Turing-machine will be of the 4-tuple, rather than 5-tuple, variety. For more on this convention see Turing machine.
(iii) Previously the authors have specified that the tape-head's position will be indicated by a subscript to the "right" of the scanned symbol. For more on this convention see Turing machine. (In the following, boldface is added for emphasis):
This specification is incomplete: it requires the location of where the instructions are to be placed and their format in the machine--
This later point is important. Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey give a demonstration (p. 36) that the predictability of the entries in the table allow one to "shrink" the table by putting the entries in sequence and omitting the input state and the symbol. Indeed, the example Turing machine computation required only the 4 columns as shown in the table below (but note: these were presented to the machine in "rows"):
2006: Sipser's assertion and his three levels of description.
Sipser begins by defining '"algorithm" as follows:
Does Sipser mean that "algorithm" is just "instructions" for a Turing machine, or is the combination of "instructions + a (specific variety of) Turing machine"? For example, he defines the two standard variants (multi-tape and non-deterministic) of his particular variant (not the same as Turing's original) and goes on, in his Problems (pages 160–161), to describe four more variants (write-once, doubly infinite tape (i.e. left- and right-infinite), left reset, and "stay put instead of left). In addition, he imposes some constraints. First, the input must be encoded as a string (p. 157) and says of numeric encodings in the context of complexity theory:
Van Emde Boas comments on a similar problem with respect to the random-access machine (RAM) abstract model of computation sometimes used in place of the Turing machine when doing "analysis of algorithms":
"The absence or presence of multiplicative and parallel bit manipulation operations is of relevance for the correct understanding of some results in the analysis of algorithms.
". . . [T]here hardly exists such as a thing as an "innocent" extension of the standard RAM model in the uniform time measures; either one only has additive arithmetic or one might as well include all reasonable multiplicative and/or bitwise Boolean instructions on small operands." (Van Emde Boas, 1990:26)
With regard to a "description language" for algorithms Sipser finishes the job that Stone and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey started (boldface added). He offers us three levels of description of Turing machine algorithms (p. 157):
2011: Yanofsky.
In Yanofsky (2011) an algorithm is defined to be the set of programs that implement that algorithm: the set of all programs is partitioned into equivalence classes. Although the set of programs does not form a category, the set of algorithms form a category with extra structure. The conditions that describe when two programs are equivalent turn out to be coherence relations which give the extra structure to the category of algorithms.
2024: Seiller.
In Seiller (2024) an algorithm is defined as an edge-labelled graph, together with an interpretation of labels as maps in an abstract data structure. This definition is given together with a formal definition of programs (and models of computation), allowing to formally define the notion of implementation, that is when a program implements an algorithm. The notion of algorithm thus obtained avoids some known issues, and is understood as a specification of some kind. In particular, a given program can (and in fact, always do) implement several algorithms. Another important feature of the approach is that it takes into account the fact that a given algorithm can be implemented in different (and possibly unrelated) computational models.

Jeff Stember

Jeffrey Alan Stember (born March 2, 1958) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher.
Biography.
The right-hander was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, is Jewish, and attended Westfield High School. He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 26th round of the 1976 amateur draft, and appeared in one game for the Giants in 1980.
Stember's only outing was a start against the Houston Astros at the Astrodome on August 5, 1980. He pitched the first three innings and gave up three runs, but only one earned run. In the top of the fourth, trailing 3-1, the Giants loaded the bases with one out and the pitcher's spot due up. Manager Dave Bristol decided to pinch-hit for Stember, and it worked out as the Giants scored four runs in the inning and ended up with a 9-3 win. Stember, however, had to take his 0-0 record and 3.00 earned run average back to Triple-A Phoenix, and never again pitched in a big league game.

Stone of Eric

The Stone of Eric, listed as DR 1 in the Rundata catalog, is a memorial runestone that was found in Northern Germany. This area was part of Denmark during the Viking Age.
Description.
The Stone of Eric is one of the Hedeby stones. It was found in 1796 at Danevirke and moved to a park in Schleswig. Like the Skarthi Rune stone, DR 3, it is believed to have been raised in about 995 C.E. Its inscription describes an attack from the Swedish king Eric the Victorious on Hedeby, who took advantage of the fact that Sweyn Forkbeard was campaigning in England.
The inscription refers to King Sweyn's "hemþægi" or "heimþegi" (pl. "heimþegar"), meaning "home-receiver" (i.e., one who is given a house by another). A total of six runestones in Denmark refer to a person with this title, the others being DR 3 in Haddeby, the now-lost DR 154 in Torup, DR 155 in Sjørind, and DR 296 and DR 297 in Hällestad. The use of the term in the inscriptions suggest a strong similarity between "heimþegar" and the Old Norse term "húskarl" (literally, "house man"), or housecarl. Like housecarls, "heimþegar" are in the service of a king or lord, of whom they receive gifts (here, homes) for their service. Some, like Johannes Brøndsted, have interpreted "heimþegi" as being nothing more than a local Danish variant of "húskarl".
The runic text also describes Erik as being a "styrimann", a title often translated as "captain" and which describes a person who was responsible for navigation and watchkeeping on a ship. This term is also used in inscriptions on Sö 161 in Råby, U 1011 in Örby, U 1016 in Fjuckby, and U Fv1976;104 at the Uppsala Cathedral. Thorulf describes the relationship between himself and Erik using the term "félag", which refers to a joint financial venture between partners. Several other runestones mention that the deceased using some form of "félag" include Sö 292 in Bröta, Vg 112 in Ås, Vg 122 in Abrahamstorp, the now-lost Vg 146 in Slöta, Vg 182 in Skattegården, U 391 in Villa Karlsro, the now-lost U 954 in Söderby, DR 66 and DR 68 in Århus, DR 125 in Dalbyover, DR 127 in Hobro, DR 262 in Fosie, DR 270 in Skivarp, DR 279 in Sjörup, DR 316 in Norra Nöbbelöv, DR 318 in Håstad, DR 321 in Västra Karaby, DR 329 and DR 330 in Gårdstånga, DR 339 in Stora Köpinge, and X UaFv1914;47 in Berezanj, Ukraina.
Erik at the end of the text is described as being "drængʀ harþa goþan" meaning "a very good valiant man." A drengr in Denmark was a term mainly associated with members of a warrior group. It has been suggested that drengr along with thegn was first used as a title associated with men from Denmark and Sweden in service to Danish kings, but, from its context in inscriptions, over time became more generalized and was used by groups such as merchants or the crew of a ship. Other runestones describing the deceased using the words "harþa goþan dræng" in some order include DR 68 in Århus, DR 77 in Hjermind, DR 127 in Hobro, DR 268 in Östra Vemmenhög, DR 276 in Örsjö, DR 288 and DR 289 in Bjäresjö, Sm 48 in Torp, Vg 61 in Härlingstorp, Vg 90 in Torestorp, Vg 112 in Ås, Vg 114 in Börjesgården, the now-lost Vg 126 in Larvs, Vg 130 in Skånum, Vg 153 and Vg 154 in Fölene, Vg 157 in Storegården, Vg 162 in Bengtsgården, Vg 179 in Lillegården, Vg 181 in Frugården, Vg 184 in Smula (using a plural form), the now-lost Ög 60 in Järmstastenen, Ög 104 in Gillberga, and possibly on U 610 in Granhammar.
The stone is known locally as the "Eriksten".

California Polytechnic State University Mustang Band

The Cal Poly Mustang Band, also known as The Pride of the Pacific, is the official marching band of California Polytechnic State University in the city of San Luis Obispo, California. Although the band is not a competitive marching band they serve as a school spirit organization. The band functions in two different forms throughout the year. In the fall the band marches as The Mustang Marching Band and during Cal Poly's winter quarter they function as a pep band. The band attends many athletic events during the year to encourage the school's athletic teams and audience support/involvement. The marching band is well-known around campus as an exciting and spirited group that brings pep, passion, and tradition to every performance. The marching band is conducted by three directors: Christopher J. Woodruff (Director of Bands), Nicholas P. Waldron (Associate Director), and Len Kawamoto (Assistant Director).
Marching band season.
During football season, the Mustang Band typically fields around 200 members. In 2013, the band became the largest it has ever been with approximately 215 members. The marching season starts off each year with an annual band camp where each member learns the techniques of marching, such as the traditional High-Step for the Pre-Game run-on and the glide step used during regular marching. The rest of the band's marching season relies on Tuesday and Thursday rehearsals from 3:10-5:30 pm and some extra weekend rehearsals to perfect their shows.
Pre-game performance.
The Mustang Band plays at every home football game and attends at least one away game per year. Popular travel places are Davis, Sacramento, and San Diego. Before each football game, the march down to Alex G. Spanos Stadium becomes a show in itself. The band marches to Cal Poly's own traditional drum cadences, such as Baja Blasted, Tick Tock, Musty Mambo, and George, which is by far the most popular. Each section also has its own moves as they progress down to the field. In 2010 a new tradition was established to warm up outside the University Union before stepping off for the stadium. On the way to the stadium, the band will occasionally make a stop at FanFest (in previous years, it was the president's house) where they perform a few numbers for fellow students. The band then proceeds to the BBQ/Tailgate party, where they perform a few more songs before they make their way down to the field for the pre-game performance. The Pre-Game Show begins with a high-step run-on, continues with the Cal Poly Fanfare, "Yea Poly," the "Alma Mater," and at the end of each performance the band plays the Star-Spangled Banner while the ROTC brings the flags to the field. At the conclusion of the national anthem, the band marches to the north end zone, forms a tunnel extending from the inflated tunnel, and plays the fight song while the team runs onto the field. This performance is usually the same for each game the marching band attends.
During the game.
During the game the band plays in the stands, drawing from a working library of about 120 tunes (and about 1000 more in the archives). For every touchdown, the band plays the Cal Poly fight song, "Ride High, You Mustangs." For every point after or field goal made, they play "Yea Poly," an old fight song revived in 2007. (Prior to 2007, "Mustang Sally" was played to celebrate field goals.) The band also plays during timeouts and even during play when Cal Poly is on defense (to distract the rival offense).
Halftime show.
The Halftime Show is the highlight of the marching band performances. The show changes for almost every game and requires a significant amount of work and practice in order to complete in time. Each halftime show at Mustang Memorial Field consists of at least three pieces which include drill elements written by the drill design committee. At some point during the season, the band gets to perform a special drill—when the band dances uniformly to the drum cadence.
Post-game performance.
At the conclusion of the game, the band scatters on to the football field where they play the fight song and the alma mater while the football team sings along. The band remains stationary and plays select songs as the audience and team leave the stadium.
Other performances.
The Mustang Band performs in three parades during the year: the SLO Christmas parade, the San Francisco Chinese New Year Parade, and Cal Poly's Open House Parade. The Christmas Parades takes place in Downtown San Luis Obispo while the Open House Parade takes place at the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo campus. The Mustang Band also performs at the Cal Poly Music Department's annual Fall Concert entitled Bandfest. Here they join the Cal Poly Wind Orchestra and Wind Ensemble and play selections from previous performances in the marching season.
Pep band season.
From the end of Cal Poly's fall quarter and throughout winter quarter, the marching band transforms into a pep band. During this time of the year, the band is strictly an arena band and plays during both the women's and men's home basketball games and women's home volleyball matches at Mott Athletics Center. The band plays popular tunes, the fight songs, and the national anthem. The band also changes from traditional marching band uniforms to yellow and green pep band shirts, jeans, and tennis shoes.
On a volunteer basis, the pep band also performs at certain events throughout the year such as Cal Poly's Open House and Cal Poly's Week of Welcome (WOW). By playing at the Open House and WOW events, the band is able to show themselves to all prospective students, which also makes these events an excellent time for recruitment.
The pep band also attends the BWC and NCAA volleyball and basketball tournaments. Every March they travel with the basketball teams to perform as a thirty-member ensemble at the Big West Tournament, historically in Anaheim (at the Convention Center or Honda Center) and now in the Greater Las Vegas Area (at Dollar Loan Arena).
Sections.
The Marching Band consists of various sections, broken down by instrument. Each section has a section leader who becomes each particular section's representative. The sections are as follows:

Min Chueh Chang

Min Chueh Chang (, October 10, 1908 – June 5, 1991), often credited as M.C. Chang, was a Chinese American reproductive biologist. His specific area of study was the fertilisation process in mammalian reproduction. Though his career produced findings that are important and valuable to many areas in the field of fertilisation, including his work on "in vitro" fertilisation which led to the first "test tube baby", he was best known to the world for his contribution to the development of the combined oral contraceptive pill at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology.
Education and private life.
Chang was born on October 10, 1908, in the village of Dunhòu (敦厚), Lüliang, Shanxi, China. His family was able to provide for him a good education, and in 1933, he obtained a bachelor's degree in animal psychology from Tsinghua University in Beijing. In 1938, Chang won a national competition and was awarded one of the few available fellowships to study abroad. He went to spend a year at the University of Edinburgh studying agricultural science, but found that the university was not to his liking due to a combination of the cold weather and a perceived bias against foreigners there. On an invitation from Arthur Walton, Chang left the University of Edinburgh and went on to research ram spermatozoa at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. With his newfound interest in reproductive biology, Chang immersed himself in research, working together with other scientists such as John Hammond and F.H.A. Marshall, under the tutelage of Arthur Walton. In 1941, he was awarded a PhD in animal breeding by the University of Cambridge on his observations on the effect of testicular cooling and various hormonal treatments on the respiration, metabolism, and survival of sperm in animals.
Chang met his wife, American-born Chinese Isabelle Chin Chang, in the library at Yale University, shortly after he moved to the United States. Chin assumed the role of the housewife in the pair's marriage, allowing Chang to delve into his work without domestic concerns. They have two daughters and a son together – Claudia Chang Tourtellotte, head of the anthropology department at Sweet Briar College; Pamela O'Malley Chang, an architect, civil engineer, and sustainable design consultant and Francis Hugh Chang, director of health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. and San Jose, California.
Chang died at a hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts on June 5, 1991, from heart failure. Upon his death, he was buried in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, where he had lived and where the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology was located.
Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology.
In March 1945, Chang arrived at the recently founded Worcester Foundation of Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, just outside Worcester, on a fellowship granted to him by Gregory Pincus to learn the technique of "in vitro" fertilisation. It was apparent that they worked well together and Chang would eventually spend the rest of his career at the foundation, researching mammalian fertilisation. Funds became increasingly available for research on reproduction from the 1950s, and the Foundation attracted a number of talented scientists. Chang guided and advised these scientists, may of whom would go on to become leaders in the field of reproduction. While at the Foundation Chang's work contributed to the development of the oral contraceptive, making him one of the co-founders of the combined oral contraceptive pill.
Professional achievements.
One of Chang's notable achievements was his research and testing of the effectiveness of certain orally administered steroids in the control of mammalian fertility. This led to his co-invention of the first birth control pill with Gregory Pincus. Chang is arguably most remembered for this endeavor as the birth control pill came to have a tremendous influence on human society and the sexual revolution. However, controlling fertility was not the primary concentration of his work. Chang's interest lay in sperm, eggs, and the fertilisation process itself. The ability to control the fertility of eggs was a necessity to his work. He initiated the study of orally administered contraceptives for mammals to enable him to better conduct his research in fertilisation. Indeed, throughout the span of his 45-year career, only five years, 1951 to 1956, were spent researching and testing the effectiveness of orally administered contraceptives, and this work was mainly on the oral mode of the administration of the contraceptive steroids, rather than on the effectiveness of the steroids themselves, which had already been previously proven.
Chang's body of work in mammalian fertilisation is large and appears in nearly 350 publications. One of his major discoveries was the effect of lowering temperature on sperm. Chang found that at a temperature of 13 °C or lower, the membrane structure and function of sperm would disintegrate, thus destroying the fertilising capacity of the sperm. This phenomenon is now commonly known as cold shock. Yet another of Chang's major discoveries was his observation on the relationship between the number of available sperm and the effective fertilisation of ova by the sperm. It was believed that the fertilisation of the egg was dependent on there being a large number of available sperm in the fertilisation process. Chang found that it was actually the physiological structure of the individual sperm that affected the actual fertilisation of the egg, and that having a large number of sperm was not necessary. He then posited that the purpose of having a large number of sperm in the fertilisation process was to allow for greater genetic recombination, in that only the strongest sperm would reach the site of fertilisation through the female reproductive tract. The process of capacitation, the maturation period of sperm that is required in order for them to be able to fertilise ova, was also one of Chang's major discoveries. This observation would lead him further to find that capacitated sperm would lose capacitation if exposed to seminal plasma or blood serum, and that recapacitation could be achieved if the sperm was placed back in the uterus or the fallopian tubes.
Of all his research and experimentation, Chang's work in "in vitro" fertilisation was arguably his greatest achievement. In 1935, Gregory Pincus had claimed to have achieved successful mammal birth from the result of "in vitro" fertilisation of rabbit eggs. As nobody, including Chang, could repeat this feat at the time, doubts were cast over the authenticity of the claim. Then finally, in 1959, Chang "in vitro" fertilised a black rabbit's eggs with a black rabbit's sperm, transferred them to a white rabbit, and was able to produce a litter of young black rabbits. This was the sort of evidence attesting to the feasibility of "in vitro" fertilisation for which many scientists had been searching. In the years that followed, Chang and his associates conducted further research to determine specific conditions of successful "in vitro" fertilisation as well as to perform the technique on other mammals such as hamsters, mice, and rats. It was on the basis of Chang's findings that the first "in vitro" fertilisation of human eggs was performed, leading to the birth of the world's first "test tube baby" in 1978.

Mitchell High School, Stoke-on-Trent

Mitchell High School was a comprehensive school located in Bucknall, Stoke on Trent, England.
Admissions.
Situated in the east of Stoke-on-Trent in Townsend on the A52, it had a catchment from the communities of Bucknall, Bentilee and Abbey Hulton and educated pupils of ages 11–16. Before closure there were around 650 students on roll drawn from a
community that has high levels of social deprivation. The headteacher appointed in 2007 was Paul Liddle. In 2009 the Mitchell High was the most improved National Challenge school in England. In 2010 Mitchell made further improvements with the school gaining 18% above FFTD targets for the % of students gaining 5 or more A*-C Grades inc English &amp; Maths. In addition, the CVA placed the school in the top 5% of schools.
History.
Grammar school.
Hanley High School was a co-educational grammar school based in the centre of Stoke on Trent which opened under its name in 1905. In 1938, the girls moved to Thistley Hough High School for Girls. In 1940, because of mining subsidence, the school was moved and became a bi-lateral school from 1948 to 1953 with Chell Secondary Modern School (became Chell High School and closed in 1988). It moved to the outskirts of Stoke on the A52 in Bucknall in 1953.
Comprehensive.
In September 1970 it became a co-educational comprehensive school for ages 12–16. The Mitchell High School, taking ages 11–16, was officially opened on 23 March 1990 by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester. The new school was formed by closing the Willfield High School on "Lauder Place" in Bentilee in 1989. In the late 1990s it was one of the fifty lowest schools for GCSE results in England. In March 1998 the headmaster, Len Wild, was punched to the ground by three intruders. Debbie Sanderson was appointed as headteacher in 2000 and was appointed an OBE for improvements made in the school in 2005.
Merger.
There had been a proposal since 2008 to merge the school with Edensor Technology College to produce an Academy at Adderley Green. Under the BSF proposals, the new Academy called Discovery Academy was formed in September 2011. The school was initially located over both former school sites until a new build was completed in 2013 at the old Willfield site.
Academic standards.
The school has been awarded specialist Business and Enterprise College status. Ofsted inspected the school during January 2004 and rated 
"The overall effectiveness of the school" as ""satisfactory", point four on a seven-point scale. However, an evaluation of "excellent"", point one on the scale, was given for:
In a letter dated 13 November 2006, following a supplementary inspection, Ofsted assessed the "overall effectiveness" of ICT to be "outstanding".
Case study – 'Side by Side with parents'.
In an innovative initiative to support pupils who were struggling to cope in class, the school invited parents to sit in with their children and found that the adults not only actively engaged in the lessons but obtained qualifications themselves. Professor Alan Tuckett at the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education said "When adults and children learn together you get a surprising amount of behaviour change in young people, they pick up on the tone of commitment and seriousness that adults bring to their study. And the adults get the energy and pizzaz that young people bring to their learning."
Hansard.
The school was listed in the House of Commons as being one of only 25 secondary schools in the UK that had no pupils taking a language course and, in 2006, as a school where no pupils at the end of KS4 were entered at GCSE in geography.

The San Francisco Refinery is an oil refinery complex located in Rodeo, California and in Arroyo Grande, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area and Santa Maria Valley. These two locations, although more than apart, are considered one operation. They are directly connected by a . The refinery is owned and operated by Phillips 66, a downstream company with midstream and chemical businesses spun off from ConocoPhillips in 2012.
The complex is capable of refining of crude oil per day.
Rodeo facility.
The Rodeo facility was built in 1896 and was the first major oil refinery in the Bay Area. The initial site was and processed approximately 1,600 barrels per day. The facility currently covers and has a crude feed capacity of 80,000 barrels per day, and the capacity to produce 4.3 million gallons of fuel per day.
Santa Maria facility.
Located on adjacent to State Highway 1 on the Nipomo Mesa. The facility was in operation since the mid 1950s. The refinery processed approximately 44,500 barrels of crude oil per day. The facility's main operation was to convert heavy crude oil into high quality feedstock for additional processing at the connected Rodeo Facility. Additional finished products produced at the facility were petroleum coke (carbon) and sulfur.
Following an announcement in 2020, the facility ceased operations in 2023. According to a 2024 proposal from Phillips 66, the facility is slated for an eight-month demolition and a remediation period that may last up to 10 years.

Howard Sackler

Howard Oliver Sackler (December 19, 1929 – October 12, 1982) was an American screenwriter and playwright who is best known for having written "The Great White Hope" and its film adaptation. "The Great White Hope" enjoyed both a successful run on Broadway and, as a film adaptation, in movie theaters. James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander both starred in the original Arena Stage production of the play in Washington, D.C., then brought their roles to Broadway and later to the film version. Both Jones and Alexander received Academy Award nominations for their work in the movie.
Early life and career.
Born in Brooklyn, the son of real estate agent Martin and Ida (née Moshman) Sackler, and a graduate of Brooklyn College, Sackler was the recipient of many awards and prestigious grants including both a Pulitzer Prize (1969), a Tony Award for Drama (1969), and a New York Drama Critics Circle Award for "The Great White Hope". Prior to this, Sackler won the Maxwell Anderson Award (1954) and Chicago's Sergel Award. In addition, he was the recipient of grants from both the Rockefeller Foundation and the Littauer Foundation. The original production for "The Great White Hope", produced at Arena Stage in Washington, DC, was substantially funded by two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Broadway production, however, was funded, at least in part, by Sackler himself using $225,000 from his screenwriting proceeds for the film version.
Sackler's work encompassed many other films and plays including the play "Goodbye Fidel" in 1980 and "Jaws 2" in 1978, as well as Stanley Kubrick's first two feature films "Fear and Desire" in 1953 and 1955's "Killer's Kiss." His filmography also includes "Gray Lady Down" (1978) and "Saint Jack" (1979), which he co-wrote with Paul Theroux for Peter Bogdanovich. Sackler was also responsible for an uncredited rewrite of Peter Benchley's script for "Jaws" (1975), and conceived of Quint's "Indianapolis" monologue about the sinking of during World War II.
Sackler's plays have been produced throughout the United States, Europe, and South America. He also directed over 200 recordings for Caedmon Audio, various theater productions, and the LP version of an NBC television special entitled "Shakespeare: Soul of an Age". His Caedmon productions included a vivid 1968 recording of John Dos Passos' "42nd Parallel".
Death.
On October 12, 1982, Sackler was found dead in his studio in Ibiza, Spain, where he lived for the better part of the year. Sackler, survived by his wife and two children, was working on "Klondike", a farcical play about the Gold Rush, when he died.

Buckshot Roberts

Andrew L. "Buckshot" Roberts (c. 1831 – April 5, 1878) was an American buffalo hunter, frontiersman and cowboy known for his last stand against the Lincoln County Regulators during the Gunfight at Blazer's Mill near Lincoln, New Mexico.
Although the majority of famous gunfights that took place in the Old West have been heavily embellished, the fight at Blazer's Mills is one of the few where reliable sources have described a feat of profound ability and toughness. Despite his toughness, Roberts died at Blazer's Mills, following a shoot-out with the Regulators, who believed that Roberts had been involved in the murder of their boss, John Tunstall. They famously included Henry McCarty (Billy the Kid), who played a part in that fight. It was, however, Regulator Charlie Bowdre who fired the fatal shot which killed Roberts, although Roberts shot dead one Regulator, Dick Brewer, at the same location, and wounded several others.
Early life.
Little has been verified of Roberts' life. He was born in 1831 and served as a Texas Ranger under the name of Bill Williams. He also served during the American Civil War (alternately noted as serving for either the Union Army or Confederate Army by varying sources), reaching the rank of sergeant before his discharge. He is believed to have been an associate of Buffalo Bill Cody during his bison-hunting years.
Roberts earned his nickname due to a serious wound: he had been shot at some point, and still had a load of buckshot embedded in his right shoulder. The wound impaired the movement in his upper right arm, which he could not raise above his pelvis, requiring him to employ an unorthodox shooting style. By 1876, Roberts owned his own small ranch in Ruidoso Valley, near Lincoln.
He was known as a quiet, secretive man, who rarely, if ever, spoke of his past, though he was reportedly not a man to upset. A stubborn loner, he preferred to ride a mule rather than a horse. He was short and stocky in appearance. He worked for James Dolan, thus, when the Lincoln County War broke out he became a target of those loyal to John Tunstall and Alexander McSween.
Blazer's Mills.
Buckshot Roberts wanted no part of the Lincoln County War and had made plans to leave the area. He had sold his ranch and was waiting for the check from his buyer. On April 4, 1878, Roberts rode his mule into Blazer's Mills, a sawmill and trading post located on the Rio Tularosa in hopes his check had arrived. Instead of the check, he discovered that the entire upper echelon of the Regulators were eating lunch in a nearby building. They had left the area around Lincoln, New Mexico after killing Sheriff William Brady just three days earlier. One of them, Frank Coe, sat with Roberts on the steps of the main house and tried to talk him into giving himself up. Roberts refused, believing he would be killed out of hand.
Regulator chief Dick Brewer grew impatient and sent a few more of his men outside to arrest Roberts. At the sight of the heavily armed cowboys approaching him, Roberts stood and aimed his Winchester repeating rifle. He and Charlie Bowdre fired simultaneously: Roberts was struck in the stomach while his shot hit Bowdre's belt buckle, severing his belt and knocking him down. Severely wounded, Roberts retreated to a doorway while firing shots sideways at the Regulators. John Middleton was seriously wounded in the chest. One slug grazed Doc Scurlock and another struck George Coe in the right hand, destroying his thumb and trigger finger. Coe shifted his rifle to his left hand, and returned fire, hitting Roberts. Roberts continued to return fire until his rifle was empty. Upon hearing the click of Roberts' empty rifle, McCarty rushed from cover to finish him off, however Roberts knocked McCarty unconscious with the heavy rifle barrel.
Barricading himself in the house, Roberts ignored both his wounds and the Regulators' gunshots, and armed himself with a single-shot Springfield rifle. The stymied Regulators tended to their wounded and implored Roberts to surrender. Frustrated that none of his men were willing to approach the house, Dick Brewer circled around the main house, took cover behind some stacked logs and opened fire on the room where Roberts had fortified himself. Roberts, seeing the cloud of gun smoke from the log pile, sighted in and fired when Brewer raised his head, striking the cowboy in the eye and killing him. The Regulators, demoralized by their casualties, retreated and then left town immediately after sending a doctor to check on Roberts. Roberts died the next day and he and Dick Brewer were buried near the big house where the gunfight occurred.
Film portrayal.
Buckshot Roberts appears in the 1988 film "Young Guns", portrayed by actor Brian Keith. A few aspects of the real Roberts' life are recreated in the film, such as his status as a grizzled, veteran gunfighter and his preference for riding a mule. But the scene in the film is a mostly fictionalized shoot-out where Roberts tracks The Regulators in hopes of collecting a bounty placed on Billy the Kid. After a brief conversation where he matter-of-factly states his intentions, Roberts opens fire on the gang, wounding a number of them before retreating to an outhouse for cover. After firing continuously at the outhouse, Dick Brewer (Charlie Sheen) dares Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez) to see if Roberts is still alive. Billy emerges and is greeted with a hail of gunfire. Roberts then kills Brewer with a shot through the chest. The rest of the Regulators again open fire at the outhouse and then flee. Roberts' fate in the movie is left unclear and he is not mentioned again.

Reformed Church of the Tarrytowns

The Reformed Church of the Tarrytowns in Tarrytown, New York, serves both Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow, New York. It was constructed in 1837 as an extension of the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow to serve the Tarrytown community.
The new community of Dutch Reformed would have had its own Elders and Deacons and shared a minister with the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow. That church has a similar arrangement with the Dutch Reformed at Cortlandt Manor dating from 1697 when the Sleepy Hollow community was first recorded as established, though the structure had been completed in 1685 and the community had been there for long before. The Cortlandt Manor community had its own Elders and Deacons but recognized the community at Sleepy Hollow as its head, and regularly went down to the village for services and to record their births and marriages.
The community at Tarrytown became independent from Sleepy Hollow in the 1850s and soon after dropped the “Dutch” association from its name. As the Sleepy Hollow community diminished and the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow became less used, the Tarrytown community adopted the name for their landmark church the Reformed Church of the Tarrytowns, adding that it was a “continuation of the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow.”
Presenting an impressive façade on North Broadway, the structure's steeple remains the highest point on North Broadway and the tallest physical structure in Tarrytown, despite not being built on the heights of the city. The church's porch of four columns supporting an extended pediment offers a refined architectural addition to the business district of historic Tarrytown.

HMCS Stormont (K327)

HMCS "Stormont" is a former River-class frigate that served in the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War. She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic, but saw service in the Arctic Ocean. She was named for Stormont, Ontario. After the war she was turned into the luxury yacht "Christina" by Greek billionaire Aristotle Onassis. She continues to sail.
"Stormont" was ordered October 1941 as part of the 1942–1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 23 December 1942 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal and launched 14 July 1943. She was commissioned into the RCN at Quebec City on 27 November 1943 with the pennant K327.
Background.
The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a "twin-screw corvette", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named after towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name "frigate" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year.
Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers.
River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes.
Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy.
Wartime service.
"Stormont" joined the RCN's Atlantic Fleet at Halifax, Nova Scotia under command of George Myra, an experienced pre-war merchant captain who had served as the alternate captain of the famous schooner "Bluenose". After training at St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia, she was assigned to escort group EG 9 out of Derry in March 1944. She served as one of 57 RCN vessels to support Operation Neptune, the amphibious invasion of Normandy, France that were part of D-Day (Operation Overlord) in June 1944.
In July 1944, she towed the damaged to Plymouth after the "Matane" had been struck by a glider bomb. In October 1944 she escorted a convoy to Gibraltar and in December, convoys on the Murmansk run to the Kola Inlet. During this period, "Stormont" spent a record 63 days at sea, the longest active period of any frigate during the war. She returned to Canada in early 1945 to begin a tropicalization refit at Shelburne, Nova Scotia in preparation for service in the Pacific Ocean. The refit, which was begun in June 1945, was cancelled on 20 August, due to the surrender of Japan. She was decommissioned by the RCN on 9 November 1945 and placed in reserve.
Civilian use.
Originally sold in 1947 for conversion to a merchant ship, "Stormont" was re-sold to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis in 1951. She underwent a four million dollar rebuild as the luxury yacht "Christina", named after his daughter Christina Onassis. She was sent to Kiel, Germany for the rebuild. "Christina" was fitted with a full-sized swimming pool, a spiral staircase and 19 lavish staterooms. It became a popular destination for celebrities and was the site of the wedding reception of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco and the actress, Grace Kelly.
After Aristotle Onassis' death in 1975, his daughter Christina inherited the vessel, and donated it to the Greek government in 1978 to serve as a presidential yacht. As such, she was rechristened "Argo" and was, over time, allowed to decay and deteriorate. In 1998, she was purchased by another Greek shipowner, John Paul Papanicolaou, who restored her and renamed her into "Christina O". As of August 2024, she was still in operation.

Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)

"Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)" is a song by written by American musician Jimi Hendrix and performed with his band the Jimi Hendrix Experience, featured on their 1968 third album "Electric Ladyland". The song acts as the title track of the album, as well as essentially the opening track following the short instrumental intro "...And the Gods Made Love".
Recording and production.
The master recording of the song was produced at the Record Plant studio in New York City in May or June 1968, with Hendrix providing the guitar, bass and vocal tracks, and Mitch Mitchell on drums and tambourine. As with the rest of the album, production was led by Hendrix, while the engineering was handled by Eddie Kramer and studio owner Gary Kellgren. The song was mixed at the Record Plant on July 7.
An alternative, instrumental version of the track – dubbed "Electric Lady Land" – was also recorded (one of seven takes of the song) at the Record Plant on 14 June 1968 by Hendrix and Band of Gypsys drummer Buddy Miles (although his track was later removed from the recording); the rendition was released by Polydor Records in 1974 as part of the posthumous studio album "Loose Ends", produced by John Jansen.
Composition and lyrics.
In the book "Jimi Hendrix: Electric Gypsy", authors Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek describe "Electric Ladyland" as a "magical mystery tour in the spirit of ["" album track] "Spanish Castle Magic" and ["Burning of the Midnight Lamp" B-side] "The Stars That Play with Laughing Sam's Dice"", as well as comparing its chord pattern to that of popular "Axis" track "Little Wing". The lyrical content of the track, as well as the entire album, has been said to be inspired by Hendrix's infamous promiscuity with women whom he labelled "Electric Ladies", with Devon Wilson (a well-known groupie of the 1960s rock scene) rumoured to be amongst the inspirations for the lyrics. Writing for website AllMusic, Matthew Greenwald has proposed that the track was influenced by soul musician Curtis Mayfield, "with a distinctly bluesy, psychedelic edge".

<doc id="6901921" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6901921" title="Biodontics">
Biodontics

Biodontics dentistry was founded by Dr. Edward Rossomando in 2001 as an area of oral health. Biodontics is funded by the United States National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). The purpose of Biodontics is to expand the dental profession in its research capacity, skill sets, and entrepreneurship. An educational program known as the Biodontics Educational Program is held at the University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine every July and assembles business leaders, entrepreneurs, management executives, scientists, architects, and dental manufacturers to give presentations and lectures to students from all dental schools.
NIDCR funding and dental educational reform.
New technologies and new educational models are believed by many to have disrupted and made obsolete the traditional models of dental education. The 1995 Institute of Medicine’s report, Dental Education at the Crossroads, suggested that dental schools must “continue efforts to increase the productivity of the dental work force, including appropriately credentialed and trained allied dental personnel”; and, “avoid policies to increase or decrease overall dental school enrollments.” The report’s recommendations stemmed from the fact that in 1993 six private dental schools closed; and many schools were plagued with inefficiencies which resulted in “gross wastes of student time [that added] to the student’s overcrowded week, squandering [of] patient time, and provided an inappropriate model of patient care.” Revisions in the process of accrediting dental schools was also recommended.
In 2002 the NIDCR began an initiative to fund experimental educational programs in dental schools across the country. The Biodontics Educational Program is one such program.
Biodontics Educational Program.
The Biodontics Educational Program (BEP) is held annually in July. The first class was made up of nine students from UConn; while the 2006 class was made up of 24 students from the Howard University, Marquette University, UConn, and New York University (NYU) dental schools. The program consisted of lectures and presentations from business leaders, entrepreneurs, management executives, scientists, architects, and dental manufacturers. New technologies, such as probiotics, dental lasers, as well as business practices including Kaizen training, were included in the program to offer students a wide range of experience. The rationale in exposing dental students to a wide range of fields is to prepare them for owning their own businesses and managing these businesses, and incorporating new technologies at a faster rate.
The American Biodontics Society.
The American Biodontics Society was formed in 2005 with the mission to promote an active, expanding profession that is adaptable and accountable to new technologies and procedures, thereby improving the general oral health of the United States and enhancing its accessibility. The ABS acts as a forum for the detailed evaluation, discussion, and analysis of innovations in dentistry. The ABS has chapters developed or developing at New York University (NYU), Howard University, UConn, and Marquette University.
Dental Hypotheses(ISSN: 2155-8213) is the official publication of the American Biodontics Society.

Lerryn

Lerryn (, archaically Lerrin) is a village in Cornwall, England. It is situated on the River Lerryn (a tributary of the River Fowey) approximately three miles (5 km) southeast of Lostwithiel.
Lerryn straddles two parishes: north of the river it is in St Winnow parish and south of the river in St Veep parish. The river is tidal up to the village and there are stepping-stones across the river which are crossable at low water.
Geography.
The village has a village school of about 17 pupils, a post office and village shop, "Lerryn River Stores", which also provides tea, coffee and cakes. There is also a pub, "The Ship Inn", which dates from at least 1762. Much of the surrounding countryside is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. An Elizabethan bridge crosses the river to the eastern edge of the village, or you can cross via the stepping stones.
The bridge over the Lerryn was mentioned in Leland's Itinerary, in 1535 and in 1573 Queen Elizabeth issued order for a levy to be charged for the restoration on the bridge. The bridge is a scheduled monument and a Grade II* listed building.
History.
The Ethy Hoard consisting of 1,095 base silver radiates in a coarseware jar was found near Ethy. It has been dated to the late 3rd century and is held at the Royal Cornwall Museum, Truro. A further 103 Roman coins were found in the river foreshore.
The first known reference to the Lerryn is a 1284 Assize Roll. The bridge is mentioned in a 1289 Roll and the mill in 1346.
A German silver smelter and adventurer Burchard Kranich ran a silver smelting house between 1556 and 1583. The house cost £300 to build and to fund the house he borrowed money from Mary Tudor, William Godolphin and several others. The mill, used for crushing ore, had a leat of 2000 paces, and the melting house, for refining the silver, was sited at what is now Fen Cottage and Fen Field which used to be known as Fining. At least 2,000 ounces of silver were smelted with ore coming from mines in Tregadoke, Padstow, St Delion, Portysyke, Peran and St Columb. In 1573 Queen Elizabeth ordered that a rate be levied for rebuilding the bridge in to aid the production of silver.
Smuggling was a part of village life in Lerryn, indeed one of the village lanes is called 'Brandy Lane' and it is said that a small cave which can still be found by an observant walker in Ethy woods, hides the entrance to a tunnel from the wood to Ethy House cellar; where contraband was hidden from the Excise Men. In reality, the cave is, in fact, a charcoal burners' cave and no tunnel has been discovered however, it makes for a romantic smuggling story. An alternative explanation is that it was an exploratory mine adit. Ethy House is a Georgian house of two storeys and seven bays.
Philip Melvill, an officer of the East India Company retired to live at Ethy in 1857. Paul King from Mungo Jerry, a 1970s pop band, lived in Lerryn.
The village and surrounding parishes have been known for their apple orchards, and in 1839 there were 131 Orchards in St Veep parish. Haye Farm has been producing cider since the 13th Century and the cider press there is over 150 years old. Penpol farm is also known for its cider.
Notable buildings and earthworks.
A large earthwork known as the "Giant's Hedge" runs from Lerryn to Looe, which is captured in the rhyme "One day when the devil had nothing better to do, / He built a hedge from Lerryn to Looe". The hedge is believed to be a defensive dyke built during the Dark Ages.
There were four lime kilns in the village which were serviced by large sailing barges that carried their cargo up river from the deep port of Fowey, but the river has become silted over the years and unfortunately, only small craft can now navigate the shallow waters. The lime kilns are still visible, even though one has been converted into a dwelling.
There is no church in the village, the nearest being St Veep. However, there was a Wesleyan Methodist chapel and Sunday school.
The village hall was built in 1926 as a village institute and extended in the 1950s. It had a major rebuild at the turn of the millennium and was reopened in June 2000 by the Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall. It is dedicated to those who gave their lives in the First and Second World Wars and is called the Memorial Hall.
Ethy.
Ethy House is set in a landscaped park sloping down to the River Lerryn. The estate is of medieval origin and was developed in the 16th century by the Courtneys of Devon. The present house is a mid-19th-century remodelling of an 18th-century house which may have been by John Eveleigh of Lostwithiel. The southeast front is plain and of two storeys and seven bays. Ethy House, including the garden walls to north and east, is a Grade II* listed building.
Ethy Wood.
During the late 1990s Ethy Wood was found to be an interesting site for lichens, and in 2013 a species new to England was found by lichenologist Neil Sanderson during a survey of the wood. "Arthonia ilicinella" was found on a small, slow-growing holly by the river, and is known from Ireland and western Scotland. Also found was "Bacidia incompta", a species which has declined along with elms affected by Dutch elm disease.
Literary associations.
Kenneth Grahame may have based the book "The Wind in the Willows or Tales of the Riverbank" on Lerryn, or at least the Woods around Lerryn "Toad Hall" could be "Ethy Manor" on the hillside above the village, and the "Wild Woods" might be Ethy Woods and The Great Wood now managed by the National Trust.
The Regatta and Tivoli Park.
The Lerryn Regatta was a popular annual event and at one time it was called "The Henley of the West". It was mentioned in the "Royal Cornwall Gazette" of 1870. There was a break for the first World War and the regatta restarted with a "Peace Regatta" in 1919. There was a second break for the second World War and the regatta restarted in 1953 and ran until 1968 when four thousand people 
attended.
Frank Parkyn, one of the members of the regatta committee and a successful miner, bought some woodland on the south of the river from the Rashleigh Estate in 1911. In about 1920 most of the trees were cut and started construction of a pleasure ground named "Tivoli Park" after the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen which Parkyn had visited. The park featured fountains, a pond, a cascade, obelisks plunge pool and bandstand. The park played a central role in subsequent regattas housing a fun fair, field sports and a pavilion. The park has now become overgrown but remains of the plunge pool can still be seen.
Village Traditions.
The village has a number of unique local traditional and has lost others. 
Ecology.
During the late 1990s Ethy Wood was found to be an interesting site for lichens, and in 2013 a species new to England was found by lichenologist Neil Sanderson during a survey of the wood. "Arthonia ilicinella" was found on a small, slow-growing holly by the river, and is known from Ireland and western Scotland. Also found was "Bacidia incompta", a species which has declined along with elms affected by Dutch elm disease.
Cornish wrestling.
Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, were held in Lerryn in the 1800s and 1900s.

<doc id="6901987" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6901987" title="Guerrilla television">
Guerrilla television

Guerrilla television is a term coined in 1971 by Michael Shamberg, one of the founders of the Raindance Foundation; the Raindance Foundation has been one of the counter-culture video collectives that in the 1960s and 1970s extended the role of the underground press to new communication technologies.
History of the term.
In 1969 Michael Shamberg, Paul Ryan and others co-founded a video collective called Raindance Corporation. From 1967 to 1969 Ryan had been a close assistant to Marshall McLuhan. While in 1970 McLuhan spoke of World War III as a "guerrilla information war," in the same year Ryan wrote for "Radical Software", a journal of the Raindance foundation, the article "Cybernetic guerrilla warfare". This article inspired Shamberg, in 1971, to coin the term "Guerrilla television".
As early as 1967, Umberto Eco used similar terminology in a lecture he gave in New York City, coining the term "semiological guerrilla" and using expressions like "communications guerrilla warfare" and "cultural guerrilla."
Ideas.
Paul Ryan was a student and research assistant of Marshall McLuhan, who believed modern technology, such as television, was creating a global village and challenging cultural values, and coined the term "Cybernetic guerrilla warfare" to describe how the counter-culture movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s should use communication technology to get its message to the public. Despite a bias in the counter-culture movement towards anti-technology, people like Ryan and former Time-Life correspondent Michael Shamberg believed new technology wanted social change.
Shamberg preferred the term Guerrilla television (the title of his 1971 book), because, despite its strategies and tactics similar to warfare, Guerrilla television is non-violent. He saw Guerrilla television as a means to break through the barriers imposed by Broadcast television, which he called beast television.
They urged for the use of Sony's Portapak video camera, released in 1965 to be merged with the documentary film style and television. The group later became TVTV, or Top Value Television, one of the medium's most influential video collectives.

<doc id="6901997" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6901997" title="Lookout">
Lookout

A lookout or look-out is a person in charge of the observation of hazards. The term originally comes from a naval background, where lookouts would watch for other ships, land, and various dangers. The term has now passed into wider parlance.
Naval application.
Lookouts have been traditionally placed in high on masts, in crow's nests and tops.
The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (1972) says in part:
Lookouts report anything they see and or hear. When reporting contacts, lookouts give information such as, bearing of the object, which way the object is headed, target angles and position angles and what the contact is. Lookouts should be thoroughly familiar with the various types of distress signals they may encounter at sea.
Criminal definition.
By analogy, the term "lookout" is also used to describe a person who accompanies criminals during the commission of a crime, and warns them of the impending approach of hazards: that is, police or eyewitnesses. Although lookouts typically do not actually participate in the crime, they can nonetheless be charged with aiding and abetting or with conspiracy, or as accomplices.
Railway use.
A lookout may be used when performing engineering works on an operational railway. They will be responsible for ensuring that all staff are cleared of the track in advance of an approaching train.

Minister of the Right

 was a government position in Japan during the Asuka to Meiji era. The position was consolidated in the Taihō Code of 701. The Asuka Kiyomihara Code of 689 marks the initial appearance of the "Udaijin" in the context of a central administrative body called the "Daijō-kan" (Council of State). This early Daijō-kan was composed of the three ministers—the "Daijō-daijin" (Chancellor), the "Sadaijin" (Minister of the Left) and the "Udaijin". The "Udaijin" was the Junior Minister of State, overseeing all branches of the "Daijō-kan". He would be the deputy of the "Sadaijin".
From the Kamakura period (1185–1333), when the warrior class came to power in Japan, this imperial court position became an honorary position with no real authority. Oda Nobunaga, who was a powerful daimyo in the Azuchi-Momoyama period, was a daimyo who held this imperial court position. This was the first time since Minamoto no Sanetomo in 1218 that a member of the warrior class had been appointed "Udaijin". Previously, the only warrior class members appointed to higher positions than "Udaijin" were Taira no Kiyomori and Ashikaga Yoshimitsu as "Daijō-daijin", and Ashikaga Yoshinori and Ashikaga Yoshimasa as "Sadaijin". The warrior class was able to use the high imperial court positions of , , and , which had originally belonged to the nobility, as a means of establishing their own authority.

The position was consolidated in the Taihō Code of 702.　In Yamto kotoba（ヤマト言葉）, it is also called "Ohoi-Mauchi-Kimi"於保伊萬宇智岐美. 
When the Emperor and the nobility held real power, the "Sadaijin" was the highest permanent position in the "Daijō-kan", the central organ of the state. The higher-ranking "'Daijō-daijin" was not a permanent position, but was only appointed when a suitable person was found.
The "Sadaijin" was the Senior Minister of State, overseeing all functions of government with the "Udaijin" as his deputy.
During the Heian period (794-1185), from the middle of the 9th century, the Fujiwara clan began to marry off their daughters to the emperor and assume the positions of and , thereby excluding other clans from the political centre and increasing their political power. From the 10th century, the Fujiwara clan monopolised the positions of "Sesshō" and "Kampaku". However, at the end of the 10th century, Fujiwara no Michinaga, who established the heyday of the Fujiwara clan became "Sadaijin", a position of real power, rather than "Kampaku", the highest nominal position. The duties of the "Sesshō" and "Kampaku" were to convey to the emperor the policies formulated by the "Sadaijin" and other senior officials of the "Daijō-kan", and to convey the emperor's decisions to them. As regents of the emperor, the "Sesshō" and "Kampaku" sometimes made decisions on behalf of the emperor, but their positions were not defined by law and they had no specific political authority.
The "Sadaijin", on the other hand, was the highest permanent position in the "Daijō-kan", the country's highest authority for planning and deciding important political matters, which is why Michinaga chose the "Sadaijin".
From the Kamakura period (1185-1333), when the warrior class came to power in Japan, this government position became an honorary position with no real authority. At the time of Oda Nobunaga's appointment as "Udaijin" during the Azuchi-Momoyama period, the only members of the warrior class who had previously been appointed to imperial court posts higher than "Udaijin" were Taira no Kiyomori and Ashikaga Yoshimitsu as "Daijō-daijin" and Ashikaga Yoshinori and Ashikaga Yoshimasa as "Sadaijin".

<doc id="6902018" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6902018" title="Turkey Television">
Turkey Television

Turkey Television is a sketch comedy series originally aired on Nickelodeon from 1985 to 1986 and re-run until 1988. The show was created by Roger Price and Geraldine Laybourne at the request of Nickelodeon in response to the popularity of "You Can't Do That on Television", another Canadian children's sketch comedy that aired on the network.
The conceit of the series, described in the theme song, was that a turkey named Thurman T. Turkey (voiced by Jim Thurman) had created television ("take one look and you'll know"), and traveled around the world filming television shows from other countries, then "bringin' it home to Hollywood and puttin' it on the air".
Format.
"Turkey Television" presented material from outside sources of varying vintage, from public domain footage (often re-edited and given new sound tracks, similar to Jay Ward's "Fractured Flickers") to not so old clips presented as is ("e.g.", scenes from Jacques Tati's "Monsieur Hulot's Holiday") to more recent excerpts (skits from the New Jersey Network's "Uncle Floyd Show") to offbeat music videos such as "Fish Heads".
Regular segments and notable skits include:
Animation was also featured on the show. Outside of the opening and interstitials, featuring Thurman in very Looney Tunes-like scenarios, there were also international cartoons including the works of Mordillo. Videos by "Weird Al" Yankovic also appeared from time to time.
Cast.
The cast featured Les Lye, Christine McGlade, Kevin Kubusheskie, and Adam Reid, all of "You Can't Do That on Television" fame, as well as several newcomers from Toronto: Steven Aiken, T.J. Criscione, and Craig Warnock. McGlade was also credited as a producer and a director. The cast also included John Koensgen as "Ivan Telaly" the Russian news announcer. John also co-hosted at least one episode as himself. Australian comedy character Norman Gunston appeared often, as well.

Madagascar Oil

Madagascar Oil SA is an oil company operating in Madagascar. It is the principal onshore oil company in Madagascar in terms of oil resources and land.
Madagascar Oil's operational office is in Antananarivo, Madagascar and its administrative offices are in Singapore. Its Chairman is Indonesian national Al Njoo. Prior to this, the company was based in Houston, Texas and earlier in London, England. The company's flagship oil field is Tsimiroro in the Morondava Basin of western Madagascar. Madagascar Oil wholly owns its subsidiary, Madagascar Oil S.A.
History.
Madagascar Oil was founded in 2004 by Canadian engineer Sam Malin and Australian businessman Alan Bond. Its parent company was originally Madagascar Oil Limited (Mauritius).
In March 2006, simultaneous with a US$60m fund raising to North American managed hedge funds, the parent company was reorganised as Madagascar Oil Limited in Bermuda. In 2006, Madagascar Oil launched its first licensing round involving 44 offshore blocks in the Morondava Basin.
In 2008, a joint venture agreement was executed with Total S.A. granting it operatorship and a 60% interest in the Bemolanga tar sands. In 2010, it raised £50 million in its IPO to finance a pilot project in the Tsimiroro Field.
Madagascar Oil was listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange from 2010 until 2016. In December 2010, the trade of company's share was suspended after the Malagasy government announcement that most of the company's oil licenses would be annulled. The dispute was solved and the trade at the AIM restarted in June 2011. The company delisted in 2016, as a condition of its lenders recapitalising the company.
On 15 April 2015, the Madagascar government granted to the company a 25-year license on the oil production at the Tsimiroro block 3104. In February 2019, the new Madagascar president Andry Rajoelina cancelled an ongoing licensing round involving 44 blocks in the Morondava basin until further notice.
Description.
Madagascar Oil focuses on the development, exploration and production of petroleum. In 2008, Madagascar Oil held the largest licensed onshore acreage in Madagascar. Madagascar Oil holds the large heavy oil fields of Tsimiroro and Bemolanga, which are the island's major onshore oil fields.
The company operates the 100%-owned Tsimiroro heavy oil field, while Total S.A., its farm-in partner, operates the 40%-owned Bemolanga bitumen field. Tsimiroro has 2P reserves of 614 million barrels and 3C resources of 1.6 billion barrels, in tar sands at depths between 100m and 200m. In addition to the Tsimiroro and Bemolanga, the company holds three exploration blocks: Manambolo, Morondava and Manandaza. On Madagascar Oil's blocks, previous exploration examples include the Manambolo West #1 well, drilled in 1987 that flowed gas at per day on a drill stem test and abandoned as non-commercial partially due to a lack of infrastructure; and the Manandaza well drilled in 1991 that flowed 41° API light crude oil.
Madagascar Oil's projects are governed by production sharing agreements signed with OMNIS, the relevant Malagasy government agency, in 2004. These agreements provide the Government of Madagascar with a significant stake in future production.
The company's controlling shareholder is the Singapore-based Benchmark Group. Other shareholders are Outrider Management LLC, SEP African Ventures Limited (formerly Persistency Capital LLC), and the John Paul DeJoria Family Trust.

The Soxaholix

The Soxaholix is a comic-based blog published by pseudonymous Hart Brachen (similar to "heartbroken") for Boston Red Sox fans to discuss the team and other sports-related news. Occasionally during the television season the blog also discusses the television drama "Lost". The site began just prior to the 2004 baseball season. The author references many different sources of classic literature, modern literature, television shows, popular culture, and internet culture through the characters' dialogue. The setting for the comic revolves around a group of office co-workers in Boston and each daily strip focuses on the conversation of two of the characters in a back-and-forth manner similar to the comic "Get your war on".
Readership averaged 1,600 visitors per day in 2005 with sometimes as many as 12,000 readers in a single day. The site has been recognized by a number of prominent online award committees and sports websites for incisive wit and mix of high-brow as well as low-brow humor, including a 2005 article in "The Wall Street Journal". It was also mentioned in the March 2, 2007 "All Things Considered" story concerning baseball fandom on NPR.
History.
Hart Brachen, a pseudonym to cover the author's true identity, grew up in New Hampshire and attended college in Boston. He then attended graduate school at a university in the South. Always a Red Sox fan, the author found the comic style of "Get your war on" appealing and chose to use the method to describe his thoughts about the Red Sox, especially given their heart-breaking end at the hands of the New York Yankees in the 2003 postseason.
One of the first entries included a discussion of blogger Ana Marie Cox and a link to her blog, "Wonkette". She linked to the entry from her popular website and "The Soxaholix" received a large amount of attention very quickly. Readership remains high and the website garners more attention when the team is doing well, such as during and after the 2004 World Series. The author was interviewed for a Wall Street Journal article shortly after the Red Sox lost to the Chicago White Sox in the 2005 postseason. The characters are not real people. Readers comment on the strips, following the lows and highs of the season. Readers and commenters are divided between real and not real, with no clear line of demarcation.
With the sustained success of the Boston Red Sox since 2004, a strip based upon failure, sadness and schadenfreude might have been expected to wither away. Not so. Despite considering a "retirement" or hiatus from the strip after the successful 2013 season, the author continues to post pithy entries nearly every weekday. (With rare exceptions- marked by life-changing events or outrageous fortune—weekend strips are rare). During the 2013 season, in the interest of his (or her) sanity, the author also announced that henceforth there would be no strip on a Friday when the Red Sox were under .500 in wins and losses.
In November 2014, Brachen announced that he was bringing The Soxaholix to an end. Among his own comments on retiring The Soxaholix, he invited the fans to contribute ideas on how to keep the community alive since the strip concluded.he is a man of his word, and the thing is deader than a cuttlefish. °
Format.
Style.
The TypePad blog entries are written in a comic-strip style using only one or two positions for each character's appearance. The dialogue is written in plain HTML above the character's "talk bubble" instead of incorporated into the images; this allows for alternate browsing such as cell phones and RSS syndication. The strip is created in BBEdit and Fireworks MX on an Apple iMac. The original blog used clipart directly from Microsoft Office, but the current artwork is obtained from completely original sources.

A House Is Not a Motel

"A House Is Not a Motel" is a song written by Arthur Lee and first released by Love on their 1967 album "Forever Changes".
Lyrics and music.
The song was likely inspired by the song "A House Is Not a Home" written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, given that Arthur Lee was a fan of their work. It features a descending/ascending psychedelic melody and a folk-rock rhythm. Lee's vocal performance has been described as snarling. According to a friend, Lee got the line about blood mixing with mud turning grey from a Vietnam War veteran.
The song begins with a 12-string guitar playing a riff in E minor. An electric guitar comes in after the second verse, playing a phrase on the top two strings. After the third verse, there is a drum break and twin guitar solo with strange vocal noises. It is one of the most sparsely arranged songs on the album.
Reception.
AllMusic's Matthew Greenwald called "A House Is Not a Motel" " another one of Arthur Lee's meditations of his own personal world, and it's both beautiful and brutal at the same time." He praised the "acid-magnified imagery" and considered it to be one of the standouts on the album. Considered to be "wonderfully dark" by The AV Club's Kyle Fowle, he wrote that it was "the most rock-oriented song, complete with blazing guitar solos that underscore the lyrical exploration of the chaos and inhumanity of war." David Barker considered the song to be an inversion of "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones and believed that the house Lee was referring to was a church while the motel symbolised the decrepitude of the world.
Treble magazine ranked the song as the 13th best song of the 1960s, calling it "an increasingly escalating series of apocalyptic visions sandwiched between folk-rock plucks and a fiery electric freakout." The German magazine "Musikexpress" ranked "A House Is Not a Motel" number 429 in its list of the 700 best songs of all time. "Uncut" listed the song as one of its 50 essential songs from the Summer of Love. The Spanish magazine "Hipersonica" ranked the song 23rd best of the 1950s and 1960s.

Sandown Raceway

Sandown International Raceway is a motor racing circuit in the suburb of Springvale in Melbourne, Victoria, approximately south east of the city centre. Sandown is considered a power circuit with its "drag strip" front and back straights being long respectively.
History.
Sandown Racecourse was first built as a horse racing facility, dating back into the 19th century, but closed in the 1930s in a government run rationalisation program. Redevelopment began not long after World War II. A bitumen motor racing circuit was built around the outside of the proposed horse track (which was not completed until 1965) and was first opened in 1962 and held the race which became the Sandown 500 for the first time in 1964. The circuit hosted its first Australian Touring Car Championship race in 1965.
Motor racing.
The opening meeting, held on 11 and 12 March 1962, featured the 1962 Sandown International Cup, which was contested by world-famous international drivers including Jack Brabham, Jim Clark, Stirling Moss, Bruce McLaren and John Surtees. A second Sandown International Cup was held in 1963, the two races serving as the forerunners of the Sandown round of the annual Tasman Series from 1964 to 1975. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the race meetings continued to attract international stars along with the best of Australia's drivers.
Australia's traditional Holden/Ford rivalry really surfaced at the track in the late 1960s and through the 1970s with drivers such as Norm Beechey, Ian Geoghegan, Allan Moffat, Bob Jane, Colin Bond and Peter Brock and continues to the present day. From 1968 to 1980 almost every major touring car race held at the circuit was won by those driving either a Holden or a Ford.
1984 saw an extension of the track to to comply with FIA regulations for minimum track length for World Championship events, the ultimate goal being to host the Formula One World Championship, though ultimately that went to Adelaide. It also saw the first 500 km race held at the circuit, the Castrol 500, being Round 3 of the 1984 Australian Endurance Championship. Peter Brock and Larry Perkins took their Holden Dealer Team VK Commodore to a one lap victory in the 1984 Castrol 500; it was to be the last of Brock's record nine wins in the Sandown enduro events.
Along with the circuit changes, some AUD$600,000 had been spent relocating the pits from its original place between what was turns one and two (now turns one and four) to its now permanent place coming onto the main straight. The new international standard pits included pit bays and lock-up garages for over 40 cars.
In 1989, the largely unpopular, International Circuit (often referred to by Australian television commentators as the "Village Grand Prix" due to how slow the infield section was compared to the rest of the circuit) was abandoned and the track reverted to , though not by using the original 8 turn layout, but a modified 13 turn course. This was achieved by simply bypassing the largely unpopular tight and twisty infield section that had been in use since 1984 and using only the re-configured National (outer) Circuit. The effect was also to bring the cars closer to the spectator area on the outside of the esses to bring back spectators to the area. The esses at the end of the back straight was a popular spectator area during the 1970s and 1980s with several converted double-decker buses frequenting race meetings.
While the extension to the circuit had been necessary to lift Sandown's minimum length to 3.9 km, unfortunately the circuit promotors, the Light Car Club of Australia, were restricted by not being able to expand beyond the property boundary which only left going infield, which itself met with restrictions from the Melbourne Racing Club who administered the Sandown horse race course who naturally wanted minimal disruption to their horse racing track. The 800 metre extension was not overly popular with spectators (there was no spectator access to the infield) nor the racers, especially the touring car teams who in that era (1984–1988) found the long runs in 2nd gear through that section were hard on drivelines and transmissions.
Sandown continued to host both the 500 kilometre race and a sprint round of the championship, the Sandown Challenge, throughout the majority of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. In 2001 and 2002, the circuit hosted the Grand Finale as the closing round of the season. When the Sandown 500 returned in 2003, the sprint round was removed from the calendar and Sandown no longer hosts two major V8 Supercars events per year.
The infield section was still used for motorcycle racing at the track until about 2001 as the high speed esses (turns 6–9) at the end of the back straight were deemed too dangerous for the bikes at high speed (the entry speed off the straight was close to with very little runoff area between the track and the outside fence. Using the infield section not only bypassed the esses but slowed the bikes down and allowed them to continue using the circuit for the series such as the Australian Superbike Championship.
In late 2007 the Melbourne Racing Club, owner of the venue, brought the management of the motor circuit in house. As part of securing the future of motorsport at the venue Sandown's Manager Wade Calderwood negotiated a long-term deal with V8 Supercars. Under this deal the MRC invested significant funds as part of a 3-year upgrade to the pits and circuit safety.
Under the local Council permit, Sandown Raceway is limited to running five motorsport events per year, at no louder than 95 decibels. Currently these events include the Sandown 500, Historic Sandown, Shannons Nationals and two Victorian State Race Series events.
The long-term future of this historic circuit is unclear as the owners of Sandown Park want to have it rezoned so that they can sell it to a property developer who would then demolish the venue and turn it into high density housing.
Sandown 500.
The circuit is home to the famous Sandown endurance race which was first held in 1964 through to 2007, with a return to the V8 Supercars calendar in 2012.
Traditionally the domain of touring cars, the race has also been held for Series Production cars from 1968–1972 and GT Sports Cars in 2001 and 2002. Peter Brock is the most successful driver of the Sandown enduro with nine outright wins including seven in a row from 1975 to 1981. The race itself wasn't always run over a 500 km distance. The first two races ran for six hours while the next two ran for just three hours. The race distance was 250 km from 1970 until 1975. This was increased to 400 km in 1976 and stayed that way until 1983. It was changed for the last time in 1984 with an increase to 500 km.
The 1990, 1993 and 1994 events had no major sponsor and were underwritten by circuit promoter and former Formula 5000 star Jon Davison.
V8 Supercars.
With the creation of V8 Supercars in 1997, the Sandown 500 event remained as part of their calendar for that year and 1998. Sandown became a sprint round of the V8 Supercars Championship Series for 1999 and 2000, then as three 150 km races with pit stops in 2001 and a 150 km race on the Saturday and 300 km race on the Sunday in 2002. The event was won by Todd Kelly in 2001 and by Marcos Ambrose in 2002. The 500 km format returned in 2003 with a sponsorship deal with Betta Electrical and have been a large part of the series since. The 2003 event was won by Mark Skaife and Todd Kelly for the Holden Racing Team. In 2004, it was won by Marcos Ambrose and Greg Ritter in a Pirtek-backed Stone Brothers Racing Falcon. In 2005, it was won by Craig Lowndes and Frenchman Yvan Muller in a Betta Electrical backed Falcon. In 2006, Ford Performance Racing got its maiden endurance victory with Mark Winterbottom and Jason Bright. In 2007, the major sponsor of the Sandown 500 is Just-Car Insurance and the event is called the Just Car Insurance 500, and was won by Craig Lowndes, his fourth victory, and Jamie Whincup.
For the 2008 season, the 500 kilometres endurance race was moved to the Phillip Island circuit. Sandown remained on the calendar as a venue, but hosted a regular multiple sprint race format event earlier in the year. The event returned to its single 500 kilometres roots in September 2012 as an enduro precursor to the Bathurst 1000, with the inaugural Dick Smith Sandown 500 won by the Holden Commodore Team Vodafone pairing of Craig Lowndes and Warren Luff.
World Sportscar Championship.
On 2 December 1984, Sandown held the last round of the 1984 World Endurance Championship. The race, known as the Sandown 1000, was won by Stefan Bellof and Derek Bell in their Rothmans Porsche 956. This race was the first FIA World Championship road racing motor racing event to be held in Australia. As the race name suggests, the race distance was to be long. However, under WSC rules, with the exception of the 24 Hours of Le Mans (and in certain years, the 24 Hours of Daytona), races had a time limit of 6 hours. The six-hour mark was reached when the Bellof/Bell Porsche had run only 206 laps (803.4 km), thus the race was declared at the time limit some 51 laps short of the 1000 km distance.
The next (and only other) FIA World Sportscar Championship race held in Australia was also held at Sandown on 20 November 1988. This was the 1988 360 km of Sandown Park, the final round of the 1988 World Sports-Prototype Championship, which was won by Jean-Louis Schlesser and Jochen Mass driving their Sauber Mercedes C9. This race would prove to be the final top level motor race on the International Circuit, with Schlesser setting the circuit's outright lap record with a time of 1:33.580. Schlesser also set the fastest ever recorded lap time of the International circuit during qualifying for the race when he piloted his C9 around in a time of 1:28.620.
Easternats.
Easternats was a car festival held at the race track annually. It attracted a large number of entrants for the show'n'shine and various other events. It comprised usually a turn out of 750 entered vehicles. This event has since been discontinued.
Historic Sandown.
Historic Sandown is an annual event held at the circuit on the first weekend of November. Promoted by the VHRR (Victorian Historic Racing Register) and run by the MG Car Club of Victoria, it is a highly successful event which in 2009 attracted a record 400+ historic racing cars including touring cars, MG racers and Formula Fords and was also headlined by the Biante Touring Car Masters. 2009 was the 18th running of the event and was attended by the patron of the VHRR, Sir Jack Brabham.
Cycling Victoria.
Several Melbourne cycling clubs hold regular races over the summer season.
Athletics Victoria.
Annually, Athletics Victoria hold a road race (sometimes a team relay) as a part of the AV Cross Country season.
Australian Grand Prix.
Sandown Raceway has held the Australian Grand Prix on six occasions, the last being in 1978, seven years before the event became part of the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1985. Two World Drivers' Champions were winners of the AGP at Sandown, Jack Brabham in 1964 and the late Jim Clark in 1968, with Clark's winning margin being only 0.1 seconds from the Ferrari of New Zealand's Chris Amon being one of the closest finishes in the race's history. John Goss' 1976 victory saw him become the first, and so far only winner of both the Australian Grand Prix and the Bathurst 1000 touring car race.
The winners of the Australian Grands Prix held at Sandown Raceway are:
Special Guest at the 1978 Australian Grand Prix, the 50th anniversary of the event (and the final time it would be held at Sandown), was Argentina's five-time Formula One World Drivers' Champion, the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio. Following the race Fangio, Australia's own three-time World Champion Jack Brabham, Bob Jane and former racer turned Holden dealer Bill Patterson, staged a spirited three-lap demonstration/race. Fangio and Brabham cleared out and swapped the lead many times. Fangio was driving a Mercedes-Benz W196 that he raced in and , while Brabham (not yet Sir Jack) drove the Repco V8 powered Brabham BT19 in which he won the Formula One World Championship to become the first and only person to win the Drivers' championship in a car of his own design and build. Brabham 'won' the demonstration, just ahead of Fangio, with Patterson (driving a Cooper) and Jane (driving a Maserati) some distance behind in 3rd and 4th.
Upgrades.
Sandown was repaved and received many new safety features in 2013 in accordance with new FIA rules. More tyre barriers were added, and new catch fencing was also added during big events like Historic Sandown and the Wilson Security 500. The main grandstand was also upgraded to feature a new bar and food complex. Along with the grandstand, the pits were also upgraded. Following a spate of major accidents at the end of the back straight (particularly at turn 6) between 2010 and 2017, the run-off area was also extended in early 2019.
Lap records.
As of July 2025, the fastest official race lap records at Sandown Raceway are listed as:

Chionanthus virginicus

Chionanthus virginicus (white fringetree) is a tree native to the savannas and lowlands of the northeastern and southeastern United States, from Massachusetts south to Florida, and west to Oklahoma and Texas.
Growth.
 
It is a deciduous shrub or small tree growing to as much as tall, though ordinarily less. The bark is scaly, brown tinged with red. The shoots are light green, downy at first, later becoming light brown or orange. The buds are light brown, ovate, acute, long. The leaves are opposite, simple, ovate or oblong, long and broad, with a petiole long, and an entire margin; they are hairless above, and finely downy below, particularly along the veins, and turn yellow in fall. The richly-scented flowers have a pure white, deeply four-lobed corolla, the lobes thread-like, long and broad; they are produced in drooping axillary panicles long when the leaves are half grown, in mid- to late May in New York City, earlier in the south.
It is usually dioecious, though occasional plants bear flowers of both sexes. The fruit is an ovoid dark blue to purple drupe long, containing a single seed (rarely two or three), mature in late summer to mid fall.
Etymology.
The species name was originally cited by Linnaeus as "Chionanthus virginica", treating the genus as feminine; however, under the provisions of the ICBN, the genus is correctly treated as masculine, giving the species ending as "virginicus". Other English names occasionally used in the Appalachians include Grancy Gray Beard and Old Man's Beard.
Cultivation and uses.
Although native in the southeastern United States, it is hardy in the north and is extensively planted in gardens, where specimens are often grown with multiple trunks. The white flowers are best seen from below. Fall color is a fine, clear yellow, a good contrast with viburnums and evergreens. It prefers a moist soil and a sheltered situation. It may be propagated by grafting on Ash ("Fraxinus" sp.). The wood is light brown, sapwood paler brown; heavy, hard, and close-grained.
Traditional uses.
The dried roots and bark were used by Native Americans to treat skin inflammations. The crushed bark was used in treatment of sores and wounds.
Threats.
In 2014, white fringetrees in Ohio were reported to be hosting infestations of the emerald ash borer, an insect native to Asia that has become a highly destructive invasive pest of ash trees in North America. Since then, emerald ash borer has been found in white fringetrees in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, indicating to researchers that white fringetrees are being utilized by emerald ash borers throughout the range where the species overlap. Symptoms of infestation include crown dieback and epicormic sprouting.
Furthermore, the caterpillars of the Inkblot Palpita, a moth in the Crambidae family, feed on the leaves.

Sexual Politics

Sexual Politics is the debut book by American writer and activist Kate Millett, based on her PhD dissertation at Columbia University. It was published in 1970 by Doubleday. It is regarded as a classic of feminism and one of radical feminism's key texts, a formative piece in shaping the intentions of the second-wave feminist movement. In "Sexual Politics", an explicit focus is placed on male dominance throughout prominent 20th century art and literature. According to Millett, western literature reflects patriarchal constructions and the heteronormativity of society. She argues that men have established power over women, but that this power is the result of social constructs rather than innate or biological qualities.
Summary.
The book begins by quoting Henry Miller and Norman Mailer. Millett examines sex scenes by both authors in which a male main character seduces a compliant woman who is insatiably hungry for sex, then humiliates, beats, sexually assaults, or murders the women.
Millett argues that the scenes have political undertones. By punishing women for their sexuality the male characters enforce the rules of patriarchy, which Millett defines as "the birthright priority whereby males rule females." She feels these male characters are stand-ins for the authors themselves, whom she feels are mired in violent sexual myths designed to maintain men as a ruling class. In contrast, she applauds the writer Jean Genet for writing queer sex scenes that critically examine these myths. Genet's work points to the "sick delirium of power and violence" that must be analyzed if society is to achieve sexual liberation.
These literary scenes serves as examples of what Millett names "sexual politics." She clarifies that she does not mean "politics" in the narrow sense of political parties and elections. Instead, politics describes any situation in which one group of people has power over another.
Millett points to her observation that the military, the police, political offices, science fields, etc., are populated almost exclusively by men. Even the concept of God is typically portrayed as male. Because men hold all these positions of power, they dominate the relationship between the sexes; women are subordinate. Men are rewarded in life for adopting an attitude of dominance, whereas women are encouraged to be passive and ignorant. This training makes patriarchy appear natural, as though it were determined by biology, when in fact it is a social convention or a political relationship.
The rest of the book is largely her literary reflections of different authors and books, including "Lady Chatterley's Lover" and others.
Central claims.
Millett makes the claim that romantic love disguises the mismatch in power between men and women, but it leaves women vulnerable to emotional exploitation. As evidence, she points to the fact that women tend to have less economic power than men, and make less income. Millett says we don't often consider the ways that outright force is used to uphold patriarchy, yet this is the purpose of sexual violence, which is common.
Millett often critiques the sexual revolution of the 1960s, arguing that it did not bring about true liberation for women as intended. She explores how traditional gender roles persisted despite changes in sexual behavior and norms. She later delves into the history and politics of sexuality, which is where she discusses how sexual pleasure has been defined and controlled throughout history by men and their expectations for women.
She discusses the social construction of femininity and critiques how women's bodies have been objectified and commodified. She discusses the impact of societal expectations on women's self-perception and relationships and examines how, due to the socialization of children, gender roles are often ingrained from an early age. She discusses the ways in which societal expectations shape children's understanding of gender and sexuality. She touches upon and analyzes Freudian ideas to explain her points, and goes on to offer new interpretations of them.
Influences.
"Sexual Politics" was largely influenced by Simone de Beauvoir's 1949 book "The Second Sex".
Reception.
"Sexual Politics" has been seen as a classic feminist text, said to be "the first book of academic feminist literary criticism", and "one of the first feminist books of this decade to raise nationwide male ire", though like Betty Friedan's "The Feminine Mystique" (1963) and Germaine Greer's "The Female Eunuch" (1970), its status has declined. "Sexual Politics" was an important theoretical touchstone for the second wave feminism of the 1970s. It was also extremely controversial. Norman Mailer, whose work, especially his novel "An American Dream" (1965), had been criticised by Millett, wrote the article "The Prisoner of Sex" in "Harper's Magazine" in response, attacking Millett's claims and defending Miller and Lawrence, and later extensively attacked her writings in his non-fiction book of the same name.
The psychoanalyst Juliet Mitchell argues that Millett, like many other feminists, misreads Freud and misunderstands the implications of psychoanalytic theory for feminism. Christina Hoff Sommers writes that, by teaching women that politics is "essentially sexual" and that "even the so-called democracies" are "male hegemonies", "Sexual Politics" helped to move feminism in a different direction, toward an ideology that Sommers calls "gender feminism". The author Richard Webster writes that Millett's "analysis of the reactionary character of psychoanalysis" was inspired by the philosopher Simone de Beauvoir's "The Second Sex" (1949). The critic Camille Paglia called "Sexual Politics" an "atrocious book", which "reduced complex artworks to their political content". She accused it of spawning what she sees as the excesses of women's studies departments, especially for attacks on the alleged pervasive sexism of the male authors of the Western canon.
The historian Arthur Marwick described "Sexual Politics" as, alongside Shulamith Firestone's "The Dialectic of Sex" (1970), one of the two key texts of radical feminism. Doubleday's trade division, although it declined to reprint it when it went out of print briefly, said "Sexual Politics" was one of the ten most important books that it had published in its hundred years of existence and included it in its anniversary anthology.
"The New York Times" published a review of the book in 1970 that predicted it would become "the Bible of Women's Liberation." The article was written by Marcia Seligson and praised the book as "a piece of passionate thinking on a life-and-death aspect of our public and private lives."

Andmoreagain

"Andmoreagain" is a song written by Arthur Lee and performed by Love. It was first released on their 1967 album "Forever Changes". The song was always a part of Lee's concert repertoire, even after disbanding Love.
Composition.
"Andmoreagain" is considered to be reminiscent of the work of Burt Bacharach, as well as Neil Young's composition "Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing." It has a folksy melody and contains major-7th chords. The lyrics consist of free association on Lee's defense mechanisms. Lee has stated that the song is about addiction and sensual temptations. The song is heavily orchestrated with string instrumentation. Lee sings in a crooning voice that has been compared to Johnny Mathis. As on "The Daily Planet,"
Lee is the only band member to appear. He is joined by Wrecking Crew players Carol Kaye on bass, Don Randi on keyboards, Billy Strange on guitar, and Hal Blaine on drums.
Critical reception.
Critic Matthew Greenwald of AllMusic, called "Andmoreagain" "another example of Arthur Lee letting the song he was writing lead him, rather than the other way around". He wrote that "its calm, infectious beauty is, in a word, mesmerizing." Ken Barnes called it "bleakly philosophical" and "apocalyptic". Jim Bickhart of "Rolling Stone" considered it to be one of the better tracks on the album.
Mark Ellingham included the song in The Rough Guide Book of Playlists - 5000 Songs You Must Download in 2007. Dave Thompson ranked "Andmoreagain" number 564 in his list of "1,000 Songs That Rock Your World". In 2002, the Italian Rock Magazine "Il Mucchio Selvaggio" listed the song on its 17 Critics &amp; Their Top 50 Songs. "Rumore" ranked it as the number 296 song of all time.

Dominic Foley

Dominic Joseph Foley (born 7 July 1976) is an Irish former professional footballer who played as a forward.
He played for nine clubs in England, finding stability in his late 20s and 30s in Belgium, where he represented two teams.
Playing career.
England.
Foley was born in Cork. In 1995, at the age of 19, he was signed by English First Division club Wolverhampton Wanderers from St. James's Gate. He made his debut on 18 November as a substitute in a 3–1 home loss against Oldham Athletic, but never managed to earn a regular place, and appeared in just 29 competitive matches in four seasons combined at Molineux Stadium.
To gain playing time, Foley was loaned several times in the following years, to Watford, Notts County and Greek club Ethnikos Piraeus. He eventually moved to Watford, signed by Graham Taylor – who had originally brought him to Wolverhampton – on a free transfer.
Foley played 12 times in his first year with the "Hornets" (one goal), also making his Premier League debut. Even though the campaign ended in relegation, he received his first call-up to the Republic of Ireland national team; his debut came on 30 May 2000 in a 2-1 friendly defeat to Scotland; five days later, his second cap, against Mexico, saw him score the first of his two international goals, with all six appearances coming during the year.
Early into 2000–01, Foley netted a last-minute winner against Barnsley, but overall found playing opportunities scarce, being successively loaned by the Vicarage Road side to Queens Park Rangers (two spells), Swindon Town, Southend United and Oxford United.
Braga.
Foley left England in 2003 for Portuguese club Braga, being scarcely used during one sole season, after which he returned to his country after one decade by signing for Bohemians.
He impressed in the team's 2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup game against Belgium's Gent, who bought him soon afterwards.
Belgium and later years.
Foley established at the Jules Ottenstadion, scoring six goals in 25 Belgian First Division A appearances his first season and bettering his totals in the following two campaigns, netting in double digits (respectively ten and 11) as the Flemish club finished fourth and sixth in the table, respectively; additionally, he helped it reach the semi-finals of the Belgian Cup in 2007, scored three goals in that year's UEFA Intertoto Cup to help his team reach the third round, notably netting against Cliftonville in a 2–0 home win (6–0 on aggregate), and was named club captain at the start of 2007–08.
Foley helped Gent reach the final of the domestic cup in 2007–08, opening the score against Anderlecht after just six minutes but eventually losing the match 3–2. The next season, however, new coach Michel Preud'homme rarely used him in his starting eleven and, with the player's contract due to expire, he was sold during the winter break to fellow league side Cercle Brugge KSV.
On 22 February 2012, aged nearly 36, Foley returned to his homeland and joined Limerick FC, having been released by Cercle the previous day.
Transfer controversies.
Foley caused controversy in 2005 when he successfully had his contract with Bohemians terminated over the failure of payment by the club of "bonuses". He then signed for Gent which had played against the Irish side only a few weeks before, sparking rumours of secret meetings between player and management after the match.
In 2009, Gent accused Cercle Brugge of secret reunions with Foley before he was allowed to engage in conversations in order to discuss his future. With his contract due to expire at the end of the season, the former's general manager, Michel Louwagie, claimed the player had discussed a contract before the allowed date of 1 January, saying: "I don't at all appreciate the way Cercle have behaved in relation to Foley. It is against the rules." On 21 January, Cercle announced that Foley had signed a three-year contract with the club, starting in June 2009. On the 27th, however, both clubs agreed on an immediate transfer during the winter transfer window.
Managerial career.
Treaty United W.F.C..
On 30 November 2023, Foley was appointed as Manager of League of Ireland Women's Premier Division side Treaty United, his first role in management. Foley's first game as manager in March 2024 saw his Treaty United side pick up a 2–0 win over DLR Waves, the club's first home win in almost three years. Foley's side started the season with a five-game unbeaten streak before succumbing to defeat for the first time that season away to Bohemian F.C. Women in April. He left his role at the end of the season having led Treaty United to their best ever finish in the Women's Premier Division.

Arcturus moving group

In astronomy, the Arcturus moving group or Arcturus stream is a moving group or stellar stream, discovered by Olin J. Eggen (1971), comprising 53 stars moving at 275,000 miles per hour, which includes the nearby bright star Arcturus. It comprises many stars which share similar proper motion and so appear to be physically associated. 
This group of stars is not in the plane of the Milky Way galaxy, and has been proposed as a remnant of an ancient dwarf satellite galaxy, long since disrupted and assimilated into the Milky Way. It consists of old stars deficient in heavy elements. However, Bensby and colleagues, in analysing chemical composition of F and G dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood, found there was no difference in chemical makeup of stars from the stream, suggesting an intragalactic rather than extragalactic origin. One possibility is that the stream appeared in a manner similar to the Hercules group, which is hypothesized to have formed due to Outer Lindblad Resonance with the Galactic bar. However, it is unclear how this could produce an overdensity of stars in the thick disk.
Research from the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) at the Australian Astronomical Observatory, headed by Quentin Parker, was the first to quantify the nature of the group, though astronomers had known of its existence for some time. It was first discovered in 1971.
Other members include the red giant Kappa Gruis and the M-class stars 27 Cancri, Alpha Vulpeculae and RT Hydrae.

Matrox Mystique

The Mystique and Mystique 220 were 2D, 3D, and video accelerator cards for personal computers designed by Matrox, using the VGA connector. The original Mystique was introduced in 1996, with the slightly upgraded Mystique 220 released in 1997.
History.
Matrox had been known for years as a significant player in the high-end 2D graphics accelerator market. Cards they produced were Windows accelerators, and the company's Millennium card, released in 1995, supported MS-DOS as well. In 1996 "Next Generation" called Millenium "the definitive 2D accelerator." With regard to 3D acceleration, Matrox stepped forward in 1994 with their "Impression Plus". However, that card only could accelerate a very limited feature set, and was primarily targeted at CAD applications. The Impression could not perform hardware texture mapping, for example, requiring Gouraud shading or lower-quality techniques. Very few games took advantage of the 3D capabilities of Impression Plus, with the only known games being the three titles that were bundled with the card in its '3D Superpack' CD bundle: 3D fighting game, "Sento" by 47 Tek; 3D space combat game, "IceHawk" by Amorphous Designs, and Specter MGA (aka "Specter VR") by Velocity.
The newer Millennium card also contained 3D capabilities similar to the Impression Plus, and was nearly as limited. Without support for texturing, the cards were very limited in visual enhancement capability. The only game to be accelerated by the Millennium was the CD-ROM version of "NASCAR Racing", which received a considerable increase in speed over software rendering but no difference in image quality. The answer to these limitations, and Matrox's first attempt at targeting the consumer gaming PC market, would be the Matrox Mystique. It was based heavily on the Millennium but with various additions and some cost-cutting measures.
Overview.
The Mystique was a 64-bit 2D GUI and video accelerator (MGA1064SG) with 3D acceleration support. Mystique has "Matrox Simple Interface" (MSI) rendering API. It was one of many early products by add-in graphics board vendors that attempted to achieve good combined 2D &amp; 3D performance for consumer-level personal computers. The board used a 64-bit SGRAM memory interface (Synchronous Graphics RAM) instead of the more expensive WRAM (Window RAM) aboard the Matrox Millennium. SGRAM offered performance approaching WRAM, but it was cheaper. Mystique came in configurations ranging from 2 MB SGRAM up to 8 MB. Mystique also had various ports on the card for memory expansion and additional hardware peripherals. The 8 MB configuration used the memory expansion module. Add-on cards from Matrox included the "Rainbow Runner Video", a board offering MPEG-1 and AVI video playback with video inputs and outputs. The other add-on was called "Rainbow Runner TV", an ISA-based TV tuner card for watching TV on PC.
Mystique's 2D performance was very close to that of the much more expensive Millennium card, especially at XGA 1024×768 resolution and lower, where the SGRAM bandwidth was not a performance hindrance. The Mystique used an internal 170 MHz RAMDAC, reduced from the external 220 MHz RAMDAC onboard Millennium, making it the first Matrox video processor using an internal RAMDAC. The frequency reduction affected the maximum refresh rate the card could run at high resolutions, crippling the Mystique for users of displays running UXGA 1600x1200, for example. Its 2D performance was measured as excellent, beating its peers such as the S3 ViRGE-based and the ATI Mach64-based video cards.
Mystique was Matrox's most feature-rich 3D accelerator in 1997, but still lacked key features including bilinear filtering, fogging, and anti-aliasing support. Instead, the Mystique uses nearest-neighbor interpolation, causing heavy pixelization in textures, and stippled textures for transparency. Without mipmapping support, textures in the distance appear to "swim", waving around and appearing "noisy", because the texture detail wasn't being properly managed and this caused texture aliasing. The company's reasoning for not including the higher-quality features was that performance was more important than visual quality. At the time, semiconductor fabrication processes and 3D hardware architecture design expertise was limited. Including bilinear filtering would have incurred a significant cost in the chip's transistor budget for more computational resources and potentially reduce graphics core clock speed and performance due to a larger chip design. There was also the manufacturing cost consideration that comes with a larger processor size. Matrox's words were not without weight because the Mystique did handily outperform the other 2D/3D boards at the time, such as S3 ViRGE and early ATI Rage products, although its visual quality was lower than those accelerators.
In general, compared to its peers, the Matrox Mystique was a competent board with its own set of advantages and disadvantages as was typical in this era of early 3D accelerators. It performed well for an early 2D/3D combo card, but it had questionable 3D visual quality. Its 2D support rivaled the best cards available for performance and quality, however. It was not uncommon to pair up the Mystique or another Matrox card with a 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics 3D-only board because the Voodoo cards were the fastest and most well-supported 3D accelerators at the time. Detractors, however, referred to the card as the "Matrox Mystake".
Driver support for the Mystique was robust at launch. The card directly supported all of Microsoft's operating systems including MS-DOS, Windows 3.1x, Windows 95, and Windows NT. Mystique also supported IBM's OS/2 operating system. The retail version of Mystique included 3 3D game titles, including: "" Mystique edition, "Destruction Derby 2", and "Scorched Planet".
Mystique 220.
Matrox released a newer version of the Mystique in 1997. The name gives the only significant change, that being the RAMDAC running at 220 MHz. This made the Mystique equivalent to the original Millennium for high-resolution 2D resolution support. The chip on the board was called MGA1164SG instead of MGA1064SG (original Mystique) as well. Otherwise, the card was identical in feature-set to the original Mystique and offered almost identical performance.
A special business-oriented version of Mystique 220, called Mystique 220 Business, was launched as well. This card came with a different software bundle targeting business users and excluding the games. The actual hardware was identical.
Legacy.
The memory and internal RAMDAC programming interface lived on in MGA-G100 and later processors, until the introduction of Matrox Parhelia.

The Red Telephone (song)

"The Red Telephone" is a song written by Arthur Lee and first released by American rock band Love on their third studio album "Forever Changes" (1967).
Lyrics and music.
According to legend, the house that the members of Love lived in had a red telephone, although the song lyrics do not relate to this. "The Red Telephone" is built on a set of folk-inspired chords. The song has been compared to Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd. Themes of the song include race, imprisonment, and death. It contains a harpsichord and 12-string guitar, and has an ominous feel. "Sometimes my life is so eerie," Lee sings, but then inverts the dark mood with "and if you think I'm happy / Paint me white."
Reception.
Allmusic's Matthew Greenwald called "The Red Telephone" "exquisite" and wrote, "it's one of the more engaging and interesting songs on Love's Forever Changes album." Ken Barnes called it "bleakly philosophical" and "apocalyptic". Jim Bickhart of "Rolling Stone" gave it a mixed review, writing "it contains both excellent and mediocre portions."
Jocelyn Manchec listed the song among the 2000 songs for your MP3 Player. In 2002 the Italian Rock Magazine "Il Mucchio Selvaggio" listed the song on its 17 Critics &amp; Their Top 50 Songs.

Tomás O'Leary

Tomás O'Leary (born 22 October 1983) is an Irish former rugby union player who played as a scrum-half. O'Leary played most of his career in the United Rugby Championship with Munster, where he was part of the team that won the Heineken Cup in 2006 and again in 2008. He also played in the English Premiership with London Irish, and the Top 14 with Montpellier. Internationally, he represented Ireland, where he was a member of the team that won the 2009 Six Nations Championship and Grand Slam. Also in 2009, he was selected for the British &amp; Irish Lions, though injury prevented him from touring with the squad. O'Leary retired from professional rugby in July 2017.
Early years.
O'Leary was born in Cork, Ireland. The son of Cork hurler, Seánie O'Leary, O'Leary attended Saint Patrick's School on Gardiner's Hill before going to Christian Brothers College (CBC) for his second-level education. CBC has a rugby tradition and this is where O'Leary first started playing. He was recognised as a talent and played Munster Schools Senior Cup for the school. During this time he continued to play hurling and won minor Munster and All-Ireland titles with Cork in 2000 and 2001.
Club career.
Munster.
After he completed school, O'Leary continued with his rugby career instead of playing within the Gaelic Athletic Association. He was a member of the Irish U-21 side that reached the final of the 2004 Under 21 Rugby World Cup. Munster announced that O'Leary would be a member of the squad for the following year in August 2005. An injury to Peter Stringer early in the 2005/2006 season meant O'Leary had a chance to play, making his Heineken Cup debut against Sale Sharks in October 2005. He played his club rugby in Ireland with a Munster club, Dolphin. O'Leary played a prominent role in Munster's Heineken Cup winning campaigns in 2005/06 and 2007/08, especially in the knockout stages of the 2007–08 tournament.
London Irish.
It was reported that O'Leary had signed for USA Perpignan on 17 February 2012, but a spokesman for O'Leary said the player hadn't signed anything yet and would be making a decision shortly. It emerged that the deal with Perpignan collapsed and, having rejected a deal from Munster, O'Leary was in a state of limbo. However, Aviva Premiership side London Irish stepped in to secure O'Leary's services on a three-year contract, with O'Leary joining the English side for the start of the 2012–13 season. O'Leary made his full debut for London Irish on 1 September 2012, in their opening league fixture against Saracens.
O'Leary was ruled out of the rest of the 2012–13 season, after having surgery on a back injury in December 2012 which kept him out for the rest of the season. O'Leary returned from the injury at the beginning of the 2013–14 season.
Return to Munster.
On 21 January 2015, it was announced that O'Leary would return to Munster on a two-year contract. O'Leary made his first appearance of his second spell with Munster on 17 October 2015, coming off the bench during the 35–17 win against Cardiff Blues. O'Leary came off the bench in Munster's opening pool game of the 2015–16 European Rugby Champions Cup against Treviso on 14 November 2015. On 24 January 2017, it was announced that O'Leary would not be returning to Munster after the completion of his short-term contract with Montpellier.
Montpellier.
In October 2016, O'Leary joined French Top 14 side Montpellier Hérault Rugby as a medical joker replacement for the injured Benoît Paillaugue.
Ireland.
O'Leary was named in the Irish squad to tour Argentina in the summer of 2007 where he earned his first cap as a sub on 26 May. He made his first test start for Ireland on 15 November 2008 against New Zealand.
O'Leary was a member of the victorious Ireland team that won the 2009 Six Nations Championship and Grand Slam, starting four of Ireland's five matches in that tournament.
O'Leary scored his first try for Ireland in the 29–11 2010 Six Nations Championship opener against Italy. O'Leary was awarded Man of the Match for his outstanding performance during Ireland's 27–12 win over Wales at Croke Park on 13 March 2010. He broke his thumb against Leinster in October 2010 and was ruled out for 6–8 weeks. O'Leary recovered to fitness and featured against Italy and France during the 2011 Six Nations, but a troublesome back and a freak eye injury sustained during training ruled him out of the remainder of the tournament. Injury and the form of Conor Murray kept him out of the Munster team for the rest of the 2010/11 season, but O'Leary was selected in Ireland's training squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup warm-ups in August. However, O'Leary did not make the final 30-man squad for the World Cup in New Zealand.
O'Leary was named in the Ireland Wolfhounds squad for their games against Scotland A and England Saxons in January and February 2012, missing out on selection for the 24-man squad for the 2012 Six Nations Championship. However, a knee injury suffered by Conor Murray meant that O'Leary was called into the Ireland squad for the remaining 2012 Six Nations games against Scotland and England.
British &amp; Irish Lions.
O'Leary was named to take part in the 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa. On 24 April, however, during a Munster match against Scarlets, O'Leary broke his ankle, which ruled him out of the tour of South Africa.

Adrian Dominican Sisters

The Adrian Dominican Sisters is a Catholic religious institute of Dominican sisters in the United States. Their motherhouse is in Adrian, Michigan.
Current Mission.
The Congregation serves in ministries education, health care, pastoral and retreat ministry, the arts, social work, ecology, and peace and justice advocacy. Adrian Dominicans serve in these ministries in 22 U.S. states and three countries: Dominican Republic, the Philippines, and Norway.
The Adrian Dominican Sisters have an Associate Life program consisting of women and men who make a non-vowed commitment to the Congregation, sharing in the mission and vision of the vowed members and in the Dominican spirituality. The Congregation sponsors two universities, two hospitals in the Dignity Health system, an elementary school, a high school, and seven literacy centers.
History.
The Dominican Sisters of Adrian, Michigan trace their origin to Holy Cross Convent in Regensburg (Ratisbon), Bavaria, a convent established in 1233.
In 1853 four Sisters from this convent were sent to New York in response to a request for Sisters to provide religious education for German immigrant children. These Sisters settled on Montrose Avenue in the Williamsburg section of New York City. Another convent was later established on Second Street in Manhattan. From this congregation Sisters were sent to St. Mary Parish (1879) and St. Joseph Parish (1880) in Adrian, Michigan. In 1899, the Second Street convent moved to Newburgh, New York.
In 1884 additional Sisters were sent to Adrian to establish a hospital for injured railroad workers. Adrian became a province of the Newburgh Congregation, with Camilla Madden as the Provincial. As the need for the hospital diminished, Mother Camilla turned to education and opened St. Joseph Academy in 1896. Students came in large numbers to this boarding school and the province grew rapidly with new members. At the same time the Congregation was called upon to staff other schools in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, and New Mexico.
In 1923, through the efforts of Mother Emmanuel Phelan of Newburgh and Mother Camilla Madden, canonical separation of the Adrian province from Newburgh was achieved. Bishop Michael Gallagher of Detroit and Archbishop (later Cardinal) Patrick Hayes of New York agreed to the separation. Mother Camilla Madden became the first Mother General of the new independent congregation in Adrian, a position she held for only six months prior to her death in 1924. At this time the Congregation numbered 440 members.
The Congregation and its ministries grew during this time. Education continued to be a major endeavor during these years. The Congregation also developed ministries in social service, particularly in parish visitation, and opened three hospitals, two in Santa Cruz, California (now consolidated at Dominican Santa Cruz Hospital) and one in Henderson, Nevada: St. Rose Dominican Hospital - Rose de Lima Campus. Today there are two additional campuses in Southern Nevada — the Siena (2000) and the San Martín (2006) campuses. Mother Camilla opened St. Joseph College in Adrian (now Siena Heights University) during her time as provincial. Mother Gerald Barry expanded the Congregation’s ministry in higher education by opening Barry University in 1940. She also built a House of Studies at The Catholic University of America to accommodate sisters studying for advanced degrees. The Congregation grew to over 2,000 members.
Under the leadership of Mother Gerald, the Congregation achieved pontifical status in 1944 and extended its ministries overseas — to the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Peru. In 1959, as the Congregation grew in numbers, it was divided into five provinces with headquarters in Detroit, Michigan (2), Chicago, Illinois, West Palm Beach, Florida, and Santa Cruz, California. In addition there was an Overseas Vicariate and a Motherhouse Vicariate. Over the years of leadership of Mother Gerald and her successor, Mother Genevieve Weber, the Congregation served in the formation of two new Congregations: the Glenmary Sisters (originally located in Cincinnati, Ohio) and the Dominican Sisters of Our Lady of Remedies (Pampanga, Philippines).
Since Vatican II.
The Adrian Dominican Congregation entered into its General Chapter of Renewal in 1968 after the Second Vatican Council. This was a time of transition as it was for all United States congregations of women religious. General Councilors became full-time participants with the Prioresses in directing the life in mission of the Congregation. Over the years, Sisters Nadine Foley and Donna Markham were elected president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious in the United States during their terms as Prioress. Sisters Nadine Foley and Patricia Walter have represented United States women religious on the Council of the International Union of Superiors General. Sister Nadine Foley also wrote chapter 15 of "Transforming the Faiths of our Fathers: Women who Changed American Religion" (2004), edited by Ann Braude.
Acting upon the directives sent from Rome after Vatican Council II, the Congregation developed new Constitutions that received approval on April 29, 1989. This Constitution and Statutes replaced earlier ones approved in 1937 and 1944. The Constitution incorporated a new governance organization based on Mission Chapters (equivalent to provinces) headed by Chapter Prioresses (provincials). The latter, with the General Council, constitute a Leadership Council which directs the mission of the Congregation.
Since Vatican Council II, the Adrian Dominican Sisters have continued their ministries in education and healthcare and expanded to include professional ministries such as university presidents, hospital administrators, directors of literacy centers, directors of theological programs, theologians and professors of theology, liturgical artists, diocesan directors of schools, parish directors of religious education, and retreat directors. The Congregation's Ministry Trust fund helps to support projects and ministries of Adrian Dominican Sisters that aid economically poor people, and offer spiritual renewal.
Mergers.
In 2003, the 55 sisters of the Congregation of Holy Cross in Edmonds, Washington merged with the Adrian Dominican Sisters. The Edmonds Dominicans share a common heritage with the Adrian Dominicans as they too were founded in 1923 by sisters from Holy Cross Convent in Regensburg.
In 2011, the Dominican Sisters of Our Lady of Remedies of San Fernando, Pampanga, Philippines also merged with the Adrian Dominican Sisters, forming the eighth "Mission Chapter" or unit of governance of the Congregation. In a coming around full circle, the community in the Philippines that got its start in partnership with the Adrian Dominican Sisters decided to merge with the Congregation. The Sisters became a Mission Chapter of the Congregation in November 2011: the Our Lady of Remedies Mission Chapter.
Leadership.
In 2022, the Congregation's General Chapter elected Sister Elise D. Garcia, OP, as Prioress; Sister Lorraine Reaume, OP, as Vicaress; and Sisters Janice Brown, OP, Bibiana “Bless” Colasito, OP, and Corinne Sanders, OP, as General Councilors. The Chapter delegates also approved four Enactments that they will focus on through General Chapter 2022: deepening their spirituality and engaging with others in prayer and presence; sacrificing to mitigate their impact on climate change and ecological devastation; facilitating and participating in resilient communities with people who are relegated to the margins; and deepening their relationships with one another, inviting others to vowed and Associate life, and expanding collaboration.
Membership and geographic scope.
In December 2020, nine retired sisters died from COVID-19, six within a 48-hour period. While this made national news, it was not untypical of rest homes elsewhere in the United States.
As of January 2021, the Congregation has 507 Sisters and 215 lay Associates, who minister throughout the United States as well as in the Dominican Republic, Norway, and the Philippines.
Shareholder activism.
The Adrian Dominican Sisters led shareholder activism efforts, including in the areas of executive compensation, climate change, the rights of indigenous peoples, and gun control. Sister Judith Byron, OP is a member with the Adrian Dominican Sisters and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, and serves as a consultant to the Adrian Dominican Sisters' Portfolio Advisory Board and as director of The Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment, a coalition of religious communities and health care systems. The Adrian Dominican Sisters introduced shareholder resolutions asking firearms manufacturers American Outdoor Brands Corporation (the parent company of Smith &amp; Wesson) and Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. and retailer Dick's Sporting Goods to report to investors regarding the steps they are taking to reduce gun violence.
The Adrian Dominican Sisters purchased 200 shares of American Outdoor Brands Corporation (AOBC), the minimum holding needed to qualify to formally submit shareholder resolutions. American Outdoor Brands Corporation opposed the resolution. Investors approved the resolution. On February 8, 2019 American Outdoor Brands Corporation released a 20-page report, which said, in summary, "AOBC’s reputation among firearm buyers and Second Amendment supporters is more critical to the success of the Company and the enhancement of shareholder value than its reputation among industry detractors and special interest groups with a political agenda."
The Adrian Dominican Sisters purchased $2000 worth of shares of Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. in order to qualify to formally submit shareholder resolutions. The resolution was co-filed by the Adrian Dominican Sisters and Catholic Health Initiatives. Ruger opposed the resolution. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager and Ruger's largest investor, and Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, the two most important shareholder advisory firms in the United States, supported the resolution. At Ruger's annual meeting on May 9, 2018 69% of shareholders voted in favor and Ruger said they would heed the resolution. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence called the vote a "first-of-its-kind victory."
The Adrian Dominican Sisters were among shareholders that helped influence retailer Dick's Sporting Goods to stop selling AR-15 style rifles at its Field &amp; Stream stores.

Christ Episcopal Church (Tarrytown, New York)

Christ Episcopal Church is a historic Episcopal church located at 43 South Broadway (US 9) in Tarrytown, New York. Topped by a modest tower, the ivy-covered red brick church was built in 1837 and maintains an active congregation to the present day. The church also includes the San Marcos Mission, a Spanish-language ministry.
It was recognized as a landmark by the New York Department of Education in 1935. In 1987 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places for both its association with early American author Washington Irving, who served as a vestryman, and its distinctive early Gothic Revival architecture. It has undergone several extensive renovations since its construction, and has had two outbuildings added, but maintains its historic character.
Building complex.
The church complex includes three buildings: the original church, a rectory built later, and a parish hall on a 17,120 square-foot (514 m2) parcel at the intersection of South Broadway and Elizabeth Street. All date to the 19th century and are considered contributing resources to its status as a Registered Historic Place.
Church.
The church itself takes the form of a traditional English parish church, with an engaged tower and transept at the three-quarters point, built of red brick. The front facade is currently covered with a heavy growth of ivy. The tower and turrets at the east front and north transept are castellated. Limestone, sandstone and molded brick are used for the various decorative elements in the facade. An iron fence encloses the small churchyard, and a chapel has been added to the south wing.
The tower forms a vaulted narthex at the main entrance in front. All walls there and within the chancel are white plaster, except around the altar. Its recess features marbleized Corinthian columns and gold paint. The altar itself is made of carved stone, painted a neutral brown, with decorations echoing its surrounding decor and the stained glass window behind it. To its right is a memorial tablet to Maria Phillips, an early member of the church during colonial times.
A similar memorial plaque to Irving is located on the wall next to a baptismal font in the north transept. It is made of Dorchester stone with columns of Aberdeen granite and Caen stone, depicting the symbolic holly of Irving's coat of arms. Displayed in front is Irving's pew, one of the church's original pine furnishings. The opposite wall memorializes Dr. William Creighton, founder and first rector of the parish. The south transept contains St. Mark's Chapel, from a church in Beekmantown consolidated with Christ in 1951.
Rectory.
The rectory, built in 1875, is a two-and-a-half-story rectangular building abutting (and later linked to) the church. It has a large pavilion with corbel tables, brick corner pilasters and steeply pitched raking cornice. Entrance is through a single-bay vestibule adjacent to the pavilion. The building also has a small wooden porch.
Parish hall.
The one-story-with-basement parish hall dates to 1898. It shows some Tudorbethan features, such as its arched windows, arranged singly in one-over-one sets. The side entrance porch has Tudor archways, and a half-timbered gable with triple window and a transom embellished with a pinnacle and scrolls.
History.
The church was started by Nathaniel Holmes, a New York City bookseller and devout Episcopalian who retired to Tarrytown in 1835. He taught a Sunday school in the old schoolhouse on Franklin Street, and soon after taking up residence persuaded Dr. William Creighton, former rector of St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery in Lower Manhattan, to help him start a church in his new home. It was formally organized on August 8, 1836, with Holmes as senior warden.
Minutes from the vestry meeting two weeks later record a resolution to build a "church of brick, 40' X 55', in the Gothic style". Six weeks later those specifications were amended to say that the church tower should be 40 feet (12 m) high and 14 feet (4 m) square, with a "plain Gothic" window, and the rear of the church square. The conscious choice of a "Gothic" style for the church preceded by several years the debut of the Gothic Revival churches of Richard Upjohn, such as New York's Trinity Church. Alexander Jackson Davis would not publish his "Rural Residences", which inspired similarly Gothic board-and-batten churches throughout rural New England, for another year. Christ Church was thus one of the earliest American churches in that style, taking a Picturesque interpretation.
The new church soon purchased the current property and by November of that year the cornerstone had been laid. Local construction firm Hall &amp; Boyce received $5,377 to complete the church. It was opened and the first services held in 1837. Creighton served with distinction as rector not only at Christ but at Zion Church in nearby Greenburgh. He is believed to have persuaded Irving to join the church in 1848; the author's presence at services was a frequent attraction for visitors from out of town. He served as a vestryman until his death in 1859, and also contributed the ivy which grows on the church facade, from cuttings he took at Abbotsford House, the home of Sir Walter Scott. Due to the closure of his Sunnyside estate for many years afterwards, his pew in the church became the primary focus for visitors to Tarrytown looking to pay homage to him.
The early years saw some moderate improvements: a church bell, central heating, the iron fence and sidewalks on the grounds. In 1857 the first major alteration occurred when the church was lengthened and a recess chancel installed. This change, making the spatial separation between clergy and laity more pronounced, reflects the influence of the Cambridge Camden Society and Ecclesiology movement within Anglicanism, which advocated for more authentically medieval architecture in the denominations' churches. This philosophy would inform the design of Christ Church for the remainder of the century.
In 1868, three years after Creighton's death, local architect James Bird and his builder brother Seth were contracted to oversee some more major improvements as an alternative to demolishing the church, which had grown structurally unsound. They put in a new ceiling and sidewalls, added the south wing, removed the organ gallery and moving the organ itself to the new north transept, put in gas lighting and refitted the windows for stained glass. It is believed that the decorative wall painting was added at this time as well.
The last major alteration, in 1896, focused mainly on the interior decoration. The original pine benches were replaced with oak, and the pews arranged so that they had a single center aisle rather than just the two on the sides. All the new furnishing boasted carved wooden elements such as trefoil piercings that enhanced the Gothic feel of the church. They were complemented by the stenciled walls, polychrome tile floor and hanging brass lanterns. While this primarily reflects the ascendancy of Aestheticism in popular design at the time, the lingering Ecclesiological influence shows in the center aisle, which puts the nave and chancel along a single axis.
Later work on the building aimed to restore and preserve it. In 1931 all buildings were clean, revealing some of the brick additions, and the sanctuary restored to its original white in keeping with the then-popular Colonial Revival trend. Finally, in 1985, all the buildings were repainted with tinted mortar to preservation standards.
It was necessary to close the church in 1995 since the bell tower had deteriorated to the point where structural engineers it consulted recommended not using the main entrance. Church members also discovered it was necessary to replace the roof as well, since its three layers were decaying at different rates and the building code does not permit a fourth layer. Services were held in nearby Ackerman Hall until $500,000 could be raised to pay for the restoration and repair.
The church today.
Christ Episcopal continues to be active part of the Tarrytown community. In 1993 it started San Marcos Mission, a program for the growing Latin immigrant population. It holds services in Spanish and other programs for that community. The church also provides space for the Tarrytown Nursery School for children ages 2–4. Other church programs include Godly Play, a Montessori-based Sunday school, and an annual chili cookoff.

Though the vocal delivery is English, American influences can be heard in the music - "Leonard's Lair" describes them as "a man playing doomed country ballads in an American whisky bar".

Jing Johnson

Russell Conwell "Jing" Johnson (October 9, 1894 – December 6, 1950) was a pitcher during five seasons of American Major League Baseball. He played for the Philadelphia Athletics.
Formative years and family.
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on October 9, 1894, Johnson was a son of Harry W. Johnson and Alice (Shantz) Johnson and the brother of Milton and R. Wayne Johnson. A graduate of Ursinus College, he went on to study wireless telegraphy at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia in 1918 before enlisting in the United States Navy during World War I. He was a resident of Parker Ford, Pennsylvania at the time of his enlistment. Jing Johnson subsequently married Mary Siez; they were the parents of one son, Donald Johnson.
Career.
A right-hander, Johnson played for the Philadelphia Athletics, during three separate stints over a period of five years, –, and –. The first gap was due to Johnson's World War I service, while the second, seven-year gap was precipitated by a salary dispute with Athletics owner Connie Mack. A chemist by training, Johnson held a significant financial interest in the Novelty Grease Co. in Mont Clare, Pennsylvania, and was reportedly considering focusing more on his business interests because he felt the salary Mack was offering was too low.
From 1920 to 1926, he played for independent teams in Baltimore, Maryland and the Virginia League (1920-1921) and in Shamokin (early 1920s), Allentown (1924-1926), and Hellertown, Pennsylvania (1923).
Following his pitching career, Johnson coached baseball for two years at Bucknell University and then at Lehigh University before serving as the athletic director and baseball coach at Ursinus College for eleven years.
He also became a popular speaker at civic organization and church banquets and other events, and became known for his storytelling skills.
Death.
On December 6, 1950, Johnson was involved in a two-car automobile collision at the intersection of Route 422 and Township Line Road between Trappe, Pennsylvania and Limerick Center (Limerick Township, Pennsylvania), a location which had become the site of multiple fatal accidents priot to the installation of a traffic light. Severely injured, he died within minutes and was pronounced dead at the scene. According to the "Pottstown Mercury" newspaper, "Johnson's body was taken to the Charles J. Franks funeral home, 21 Main street, Trappe." Reportedly "heard for more than half a mile," the collision was so hard that it forced "the front end of the ex-athlete's 1941 sedan ... almost back to the windshield" as it ejected Johnson from his vehicle. His body was found beneath the vehicle of the other driver, who survived, but was seriously injured. "Positive identification" of Johnson's body was made at the funeral home "from papers in his wallet." The Pennsylvania State Police later charged the driver of the other car with involuntary manslaughter.
A fifty-year-old resident of Collegeville at the time of his death, Johnson had been employed as a manager of the McCarraher Brothers store in Pottstown.
The Rev. Escol Sellers and the Rev. R. Earl Marcus, the pastor of the Parkerford Baptist Church, conducted the funeral services, which were held at Johnson's home in Collegeville on December 10, prior to his interment at the Parkerford Baptist Church Cemetery.

The Storyteller Sequence

The Storyteller Sequence is a series of one act dramas written for young people by Philip Ridley. The plays, all set in east London, use fairytale stories and theatrical conventions to reveal the traumas of their young protagonists. To date there are five plays in the sequence, although Ridley has intimated there will eventually be seven. The five written to date are "Karamazoo", "Fairytaleheart", "Moonfleece", "Sparkleshark" and "Brokenville"; note that although this is not the order in which the plays were written and performed chronologically, it is the order Ridley intends the finished "sequence" to run.
A collection bringing together the five plays produced so far in the sequence was published by Bloomsbury Methuen Drama in late 2015.
"Karamazoo" (2004).
"Karamazoo" is a fifteen-minute monologue from an east London teenager called Ace. Two versions of the play exist, for male and female actors respectively. Ace is the most popular boy/girl at school, waiting at a bus stop for a date. Through his/her interaction with the audience, we discover that Ace's recent surge in popularity is the result of a personality "makeover" following the death of a parent; in recounting the fairytale stories told by the dead father/mother, Ace reveals how much the loss still haunts them and realises the vacuousness and selfishness.
The monologue was part of the National Theatre Shell Connections 2004 portfolio, with the first drafts of both the male and female version of the monologue being made available to download for free from the NT Shell Connections website.
"Fairytaleheart" (1998).
In "Fairytaleheart", two 15-year-old youths deal with ruptured families and homelessness by embracing their hopes and fears in a derelict community centre.
Kirsty's mother died two years ago, but she is still grieving whilst watching her father announce his engagement to her 'stepmother' she flees her own birthday party and sits alone in the community centre that was once her mother's 'kingdom', where she then meets Gideon: the complete opposite to popular, pretty, pretentious Kirsty. He's a scruffy boy with 'rat tails' for hair. Together by the catharsis of storytelling they enter the magic world of karamazoo and search for the 'luminous butterfly'. Finally finding it in themselves to see their problems in a new light. The story ends seeming as though they are about to kiss.
"Sparkleshark" (1997).
"Sparkleshark" is a play about a teenage boy called Jake. As he is sitting alone, on top of the block of flats he lives in, writing stories, a troubled girl who is polly (she's a carer for her younger brother) who has started in his school, who recently moved into the block of flats comes up to quietly fix a satellite dish. At first he is abusive and defensive but lightens to her when she compliments his work. More people come up to the roof for different reasons. Natasha, the popular girl, goes up to find Polly; Carol, the wannabe, follows Natasha after getting bored. She then calls up Russell, the school Bully and his two friends Buzz and Speed Follow, as well as "emo" Shane, Natasha's ex-Boyfriend. As Russell and his boys go to dangle Jake over the roof they are stopped by the offer to hear a story by Jake, at first a little hesitant to tell one as it was Polly's idea, but eventually he does, and as he does the others start acting it out. It is a fairytale about a Prince (Russell) and his Horses (Buzz and Speed), a Princess (Polly) her father (Jake), a Witch (Tasha) and a Wizard (Shane) and a Frog (Carol) at the end of the story they are attacked by a dragon known as "Sparkleshark" due to its shiny scales, who is played by Finn, Polly's Grunge brother. The story has a happy ending with all being resolved and the play ends with all the group promising to meet up on a regular basis to read and act out stories.
"Moonfleece" (2004).
"Moonfleece" is the story of Curtis, a young right-wing activist in East London who arranges a meeting in a flat in a derelict tower block where he grew up. Years ago, when he was a child, Curtis lived happily here but, then, tragedy struck and his elder brother died. Now Curtis is seeing his brother's ghost. With the aid of Gavin and Tommy, fellow members of the right wing political party of which he is a leading figure, Curtis aims to find out why this ghost is haunting him. Things, however, do not go as planned. For a start, there are two squatters now occupying the flat. And one of them has a story to tell. A story that will change Curtis's life forever.
"Moonfleece" received a professional world premiere in March–April 2010, opening at Rich Mix on Bethnal Green Road for the 2010 East Festival before touring the UK, produced by London-based independent theatre company Supporting Wall. The production stars Sean Verey ("Skins", "Dead Man Running") as Curtis and is directed by David Mercatali. The controversial play has been banned in Dudley, but afterwards was performed in Greenwich. Its poster was designed by photographer Adam Levy.
"Brokenville" (2000).
"Brokenville" has had the longest gestation period of all Ridley's plays. It was first performed as "Cavesongs" and was part of Ridley's performance art work while he was a student at St Martin's School of Art. It was then done as an afternoon rehearsed reading at the Hampstead Theatre in London (with Jude Law playing one of the parts, fresh from doing Ridley's "The Fastest Clock in the Universe") and subsequently presented as a work-in-progress for a short run under the name of "Apocalyptica". Ridley continued working on the play, until it became "Brokenville", and it subsequently became part of the National Theatre Connections plays for young people and performed at the Olivier Stage of the National Theatre in England in 2003. It was more recently performed in March 2015 by a drama group starring Rachel Price and Georgia Sloan. The background for "Brokenville" is an unknown disaster, which has left the play's seven characters with little knowledge of who they are or of what has happened. As an old woman and five teenagers begin to act out stories for a mute and frightened child, they begin to discover a little of who they were and what they can be.

Chainsaw Kittens (album)

Chainsaw Kittens is the fourth studio album by the American alternative rock band Chainsaw Kittens. It was released in 1996 through Scratchie Records.
Critical reception.
"Alternative Rock" wrote that the "glitter roots still shine through boldly, but the punk intensity has disappeared, along with most of their jangly pop melodies." The "Chicago Tribune" called it "one of the sleeper pop records of '96" and "arguably the career high point" for the band.

Under Ben Bulben

"Under Ben Bulben" is a poem written by Irish poet W. B. Yeats.
Composition.
It is believed to be one of the last poems he wrote, being drafted when he was 73, in August 1938 when his health was already poor (he died in January 1939).
Publication.
"Under Ben Bulben" was first published in July 1939, six months after Yeats' death, as the first poem in the collection "Last Poems and Two Plays" in a limited edition released by his sister. The trade edition "Last Poems &amp; Plays", published in 1940, added the content of "New Poems" and three poems printed in "On the Boiler". It also made "Under Ben Bulben" the final poem, a convention followed until the 1980s when it became clear that the original arrangement better reflected the poet's intentions.
Context.
Ben Bulben is a large flat-topped rock formation in County Sligo, Ireland. It is famous in Irish legend, appearing in "The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne", and was the site of a military confrontation during the Irish Civil War.
The phrase "Mareotic Lake", which appears in the second line of the poem, is used in the classical religious work "De Vita Contemplativa" to refer to Lake Mariout in Egypt which was the location of the Therapeutae, a community of religious hermits.
Phidias, mentioned in part IV of the poem, was one of the most influential sculptors in classical Athens. The Parthenon Frieze was probably sculpted under his direction.
Yeats's gravestone.
Yeats is buried in the churchyard of Drumcliffe Church in Sligo, which stands at the foot of Ben Bulben. The last three lines of the poem are used as the epitaph on Yeats' gravestone, and they were composed with that intention:
&lt;poem&gt;
Cast a cold eye
On life, on death
Horseman, pass by!
&lt;/poem&gt;
Cultural influences.
The title of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Larry McMurtry's first novel, "Horseman, Pass By," as well as the title of French writer Michel Déon's book "Horseman, Pass By!" , are derived from the last line of this poem. 
Also Dennis Parry wrote a novel with the same title.
The poem, read by actor Richard Harris, opens and closes an album of Yeats's poems set to music, entitled "Now and in a Time to Be".

<doc id="6902463" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6902463" title="Frescata">
Frescata

Frescata was a registered trademark of Wendy's restaurants, and was used to refer to its now-discontinued line of cold sandwiches. The products were made in a "deli" style, and designed to compete with Subway and Blimpie's food offerings. The Frescata product did not offer the "watch while it's made" format as other sandwich shops offer. Due to poor sales and long preparation times, the product has been dropped. The sandwiches in the Frescata line included the Frescata Club, Roasted Turkey &amp; Swiss, Black Forest Ham &amp; Swiss and Chunky Chicken Salad Frescata. The original lineup had the Roasted Turkey with Basil Pesto in place of the Chunky Chicken Salad. The Frescata was introduced in April 2006, and disengagement began in December 2007.
Name.
According to the "St. Petersburg Times", the word "Frescata" does not appear to mean anything in any other language, including Italian, referenced in the name of the "Frescata Italiana" sandwich. According to the article, the word "Frescata" was coined to bring to mind the word "fresh".

La Crete

La Crete ( ), also spelled La Crête, is a hamlet in northern Alberta, Canada, within Mackenzie County. It is located on Highway 697, approximately southeast of High Level and north of Edmonton.
The hamlet is in Census Division No. 17 and in the federal riding of Peace River—Westlock.
The name "La Crête" means "the ridge" in French, which is how the earliest settlers described the area they settled.
History.
La Crete was first settled in 1914 as La Crête Landing. When the first Mennonites arrived in the 1930s, they settled a short distance southwest of the original settlement on the current site of La Crete. When the first highways were built into the area in the 1960s, the population began to increase as new settlers arrived, and in 1979, La Crete was declared a hamlet.
Geography.
The Hamlet of La Crete is west of Highway 697, mostly between Township Road 1060 and Township Road 1062 (109 Avenue). Lake Tourangeau is adjacent to the hamlet to the northwest.
Demographics.
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, La Crete had a population of 3,856 living in 1,329 of its 1,397 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 3,396. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
The residents of La Crete typically speak English or German.
Attractions.
La Crete has walking trails that were paved using donations from local residents. There is a Mennonite Heritage Village sited on "10 acres of land homesteaded by Henry H. Peters in 1950".
Government.
A ward boundary bisects the Hamlet of La Crete, which results in it having representation on Mackenzie County Council by two councillors. Ward 3, which is west of 99 Street, is represented by Peter Braun, while Ward 4, which is east of 99 Street, is represented by David Driedger.
Transportation.
During the summer months the La Crete Ferry, also known as the Tompkins Landing Ferry, one of only six ferries still operating in Alberta, shuttles vehicles across the Peace River on Highway 697 about 70 kilometres southwest of the hamlet. In the winter, an ice bridge is maintained at the same spot. This access connects La Crete to the Mackenzie Highway near Paddle Prairie, offering a considerable time saving when travelling to or from La Crete. During the spring and fall, when the river is unfit for the ferry and the ice too thin to support vehicle traffic, or at other times when the ferry is not operational, travellers must continue north to High Level, then east on Highway 58 before coming back south to reach La Crete. In the summer of 2006 a sandbar formed in the centre of the river, where the ferry normally crossed, forcing it to travel around it. The sandbar has grown to such a size that the ferry does not always run if the water level is too low.

North Carolina Highway 87

North Carolina Highway 87 (NC 87) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of North Carolina. NC 87 begins in the Atlantic coastal town of Southport and crosses into Virginia at the Virginia state line five miles (8 km) north of Eden in Rockingham County. At in length, NC 87 is the second-longest state highway in the U.S. state of North Carolina with only North Carolina Highway 24 (NC 24) being longer. The longest north–south state highway, NC 87 travels along a relatively straight southeast–northwest path, connecting Cape Fear region with the Piedmont. It is also the main north-south route connecting the cities of Fayetteville, Sanford, Burlington and Reidsville.
Route description.
NC 87 is a four-lane, divided highway with at-grade crossings between Elizabethtown and Sanford with the exception of Fayetteville, where NC 87 is a freeway. Other sections that are four-lane, divided highways include concurrencies with US 17 and US 74/US 76 in Brunswick County.
In Sanford, it intersects US 421, on which users can travel east to Lillington, or northwest to Greensboro, and Winston-Salem. North of Sanford, NC 87 runs concurrent with US 15/US 501 to Pittsboro. It then continues towards Graham as a two-lane highway. It returns to four-lanes in southern Graham, returning to two-lane in downtown Graham. The route makes a left turn one block north of the Alamance County Courthouse, where it follows a two-lane road before making a right turn onto a four-lane street. The highway remains four-lane through downtown Burlington, returning to mostly two lanes for the remainder of its route in North Carolina, save for Reidsville, where it intersects US 29, and runs on four-lane commercial corridor Freeway Drive.
History.
North Carolina Highway 303.
North Carolina Highway 303 (NC 303) was a primary state highway in the U.S. state of North Carolina. Established as an original state highway, NC 303 was routed from NC 30, in Pollocksville, west through Trenton, before ending at NC 10/NC 11, in Kinston. In 1925, all of NC 303 was renumbered as part of NC 12. In 1930, NC 303 was resurrected as a new primary routing from NC 130 (now NC 211), near Southport, to NC 30 (became US 17 in late 1934), near Winnabow. On October 23, 1952, NC 303 was renumbered as an extension of NC 87.
Special routes.
Elizabethtown business loop.
North Carolina Highway 87 Business (NC 87 Bus.), was established in 1997, when mainline NC 87 was moved south to bypass downtown Elizabethtown. NC 87 Business follows the original alignment along Broad Street.
Fayetteville alternate route 1.
North Carolina Highway 87 Alternate (NC 87A), was established between 1940-44 as a new primary routing. It ran from US 15A/NC 87 (Hay Street) north along Robeson Street and then west along Fort Bragg Boulevard, recombining with mainline NC 87 on Fort Bragg Road. Sometime between 1945–49, it switched with mainline NC 87.
Fayetteville alternate route 2.
North Carolina Highway 87 Alternate (NC 87A), was established between 1945–49, the second NC 87A in Fayetteville followed the original NC 87 alignment along Hay Street, Morganton Road, and Fort Bragg Road. The route was decommissioned between 1955-57.
Sanford bypass.
North Carolina Highway 87 Bypass (NC 87 By-pass) was established in 2013 as a new primary route along existing sections of the Sanford Bypass (formally SR 9000), from NC 87 to US 1/US 15/US 501. The request to establish a bypass was pushed by the Sanford City Council and Lee County. Typically, the old alignment would become a business loop, but instead the NC 87 mainline remained unchanged. The bypass is built as a freeway; which shares designation with US 421.

Sigtrygg Runestones

The two Sigtrygg Runestones, designated as DR 2 and DR 4 in the Rundata catalog, are two of the Hedeby stones that were found in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, which during the Viking Age was part of Denmark. The runestones were raised after the Danish king Sigtrygg Gnupasson by his mother Ásfriðr. Together with the account of Adam of Bremen, the two inscriptions constitute evidence for the House of Olaf on the Danish throne.
The stones are dated as being carved after 934 C.E. as the historian Widukind of Corvey recorded that King Gnupa, who is mentioned in both inscriptions, was forced to pay a tribute to the German king in that year.
DR 2.
DR 2 was found at Haddeby in Schleswig-Holstein in 1797. At one time, scholars considered the word and rune selection on this runestone, when compared with the inscription on DR 4, along with other inscriptions as evidence of Swedish influence in Denmark during the 10th century. For example, although both DR 2 and DR 4 use the Younger Futhark, DR 2 uses "short twig" style runes for the n- and a-runes. However, in recent years this has been downplayed after it was shown that part of the evidence was actually due to a misdating of another runestone and the possible misspellings of some words in the inscriptions.
DR 4.
DR 4 was discovered in 1887 on the ramparts of Gottorf Castle. Prior to the recognition of the historical significance of runestones, they were often used as construction materials for roads, walls, and buildings.

Thetford, Lincolnshire

Thetford is a hamlet and farm in the civil parish of Baston in the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England.
Although Thetford has shrunken to a single farmhouse and associated outbuildings, this was once a manor of Spalding Priory with its own chapel. There are records of ministers being installed in 1529 and 1539. The present house and barn are Grade II listed buildings.
Thetford lies north of the village of Baston and to the south of the River Glen. It is on the line of the Car Dyke, a ditch or catchwater drain dating to the time of the Roman occupation, which is regarded as the western boundary of The Fens. The A15 road, that crosses the Glen at Kate's Bridge, runs less than west of Thetford.

Useppa Island

Useppa Island is an island located near the northern end of Pine Island Sound in Lee County, Florida, United States. It has been known for luxury resorts since the late 19th century, and it is currently the home of the private Useppa Island Club. On May 21, 1996, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, due to its archaeological significance.
Name.
In the early 1830s the island was variously called Caldez's Island, Toampe, and Joseffa. Records indicate that José Caldez, who had operated a fishing "rancho" on the island, called it Josepha's when he sold it in 1833. The name Useppa first appeared on a hydrological chart of the area in 1855.
Like the nearby islands of Gasparilla, Sanibel, and Captiva, a folk etymology has developed connecting Useppa Island's name to the legendary pirate captain José Gaspar, also known as Gasparilla. A local folk story, extant in at least two versions, tells of Gaspar kidnapping a Spanish princess, with whom he becomes enamored. When she spurns his advances he kills her, but is overtaken by remorse and buries her himself on the beach. One version identifies the princess as Josefa, daughter of Martín de Mayorga, Viceroy of New Spain from 1779 to 1782, and indicates that her burial place of Useppa Island still bears her name in an altered form.
Geology.
Useppa Island is long north to south, and up to wide. A ridge, up to high, runs along much of the eastern edge of the island. A ridge up to high is in the middle of the island along the western side. A conical shell midden with ramps is located on the west side of the island towards the southern end. The southern end of the island may have grown by as much as during the 20th century, possibly when a golf course was developed there. The island was part of the Florida mainland during the last glacial period, when the sea level around Florida was or more lower than today. Useppa Island is high ground that became separated from the mainland by a rising sea level around 4500 BCE. This high ground is believed to be stabilized sand dunes formed during a high sea level episode prior to the last glacial episode. During the period from 4500 BCE to 3000 BCE barrier islands formed to the west of Useppa Island, creating Pine Island Sound and protecting Useppa Island from the open Gulf of Mexico.
History.
Before Useppa Island separated from the mainland, the area was visited by Paleo-Indians, who were present in Florida by at least 8,000 BCE. Soon after the sea level had risen enough to separate the island from the mainland, around 4500 BCE, Indians of the Archaic period began living on the island for part of the year, primarily during the spring and summer. Oyster shells were deposited in middens from this time. Tools made from seashells during the period from 4500 BCE to 3000 BCE show a cultural affinity with Horr's Island to the south.
After about 3000 BCE bodies were buried on Useppa Island in a flexed position. Steatite stone vessels and fiber-tempered pottery came into use on the island after 2000 BCE. Sand-tempered pottery appeared after 1200 BCE. Seasonal occupation of the island continued through the end of the Archaic period (c. 500 BCE) and into the Caloosahatchee culture period, until about 1200. While the island may have been used occasionally as a fishing camp after that date, there is no known sustained occupation of the island until after 1700. Shortly after 1700, the Calusa people (the people of the Caloosahatchee culture region during the historic period) were killed, carried away to slavery, or driven out of the area by Creek and Yamasee people (who later coalesced into the Seminole.
Later in the 18th century and as late as 1835 Muspa Indians, possibly descendants of people who lived in the Calusa town of Muspa (on or near Marco Island) were reported to be living in the Charlotte Harbor and Pine Island area. Around 1784, Jose Caldez of Cuba began using Useppa Island as the base for his seasonal fishing operations. Caldez employed both Cubans and local Native Americans at this fishing "rancho". By 1833 the "rancho" consisted of close to 20 palmetto-thatched houses and about 60 people.
The Second Seminole War began in late 1835. Henry Crews, the U.S. Customs officer on Josefa Island (Useppa), was killed in late March 1836, possibly by Seminoles or by Indians working at the "rancho". Crews had been at odds with the Spaniards at the fishing "rancho", believing that they were using fishing as a cover for large scale smuggling. After the death of Crews, the "Americans" living around Charlotte Harbor, which probably included Spaniards and "rancho" Indians, fled to the "rancho" operated by William Bunce on Passage Island in Tampa Bay. In late 1836 the "ranchos" around Charlotte Harbor, including the Caldez "rancho" on Useppa, were reported to be abandoned and "largely destroyed." "Rancho" Indians, including those who were married to Cubans or were half-Cuban, were gathered up by the Army and sent west to Indian Territory.
The area around Charlotte Harbor and Pine Island, including Josefa Island, remained sparsely inhabited for several decades. The U.S. Army established Fort Casey on, renamed, Useppa Island early in 1850, but abandoned it before the end of the year. Union troops and refugee Union sympathizers occupied the island in December 1863, and mounted a small raid into Charlotte Harbor and up the Myakka River, which resulted in some skirmishes with Confederate troops and irregulars. The troops on Useppa Island moved to Fort Myers after it was established in January, 1864. The Census of 1870 found two residents on the island. It was reported to be uninhabited in 1885, and to have one family in residence in 1895.
Chicago businessman John Roach built a hotel on Useppa Island in 1896. Barron Collier bought the island in 1911, and developed the resort, enlarging the hotel and adding tennis courts and a 9-hole golf course. Collier made the island his official residence, from which he directed his real estate empire. Collier died in 1939, and the resort was closed during World War II. Hurricanes in 1944 and 1946 damaged the hotel, and it was torn down. The island opened again as a resort in 1946, continuing until 1960. In 1960, Useppa briefly served as a CIA training base for Cuban exiles in preparation for the Bay of Pigs Invasion.
Useppa Island changed hands four times in the 1960s and 1970s, with two short-lived attempts to operate it as a resort. Gar Beckstead bought the island in 1976 and his company, Useppa Inn and Dock Company, has operated it as a private resort since then. Hurricane Charley heavily damaged the island in 2004. The rebuilt Collier Inn was re-opened one year later.
The Useppa Island Historical Society operates the Barbara Sumwalt Museum on the island.
Archaeological investigations.
While some archaeologists passed by or visited Useppa Island in the 19th century, the first scientific excavation on the island was by John Griffin and Hale Smith, who collected ceramics from a disturbed midden in 1947. Jerald Milanich and Jefferson Chapman conducted more extensive excavations on Collier Mound and adjacent middens in 1979 and 1980, using a backhoe to dig trenches in mound and middens.
William Marquardt and Michael Hansinger conducted an excavation on Collier Ridge in 1985. Marquardt and Corbett Torrence excavated several locations on the island in 1989. Marquardt excavated a burial on a lot scheduled for construction in 1994. Volunteers associated with the Rendell Research Society, the University of California Los Angeles, and the Useppa Island Historical Society excavated a shell axe workshop on the island in 2006.

Angels in the Sky (Dick Glasser song)

"Angels in the Sky" is a popular song by Dick Glasser. It was published in 1954 and has been recorded by a number of artists. The first recording was by Glasser himself and was issued on Jack Gale's label, Triple A (#2522), flipped with "Is It Too Late?", another Glasser composition. In 1954, Gale would strike a deal with RCA Victor for the song and it was then recorded and released by Tony Martin on RCA Victor #5757 about August 1954, flipped with "Boulevard Of Nightingales". A part of the deal was that Glasser's recording would be withdrawn from the market.
The biggest hit for the song would happen later in the following year with a version by The Crew-Cuts on Mercury Records #70741. It first reached the "Billboard" charts on December 17, 1955. On the Disk Jockey chart, it peaked at #16; on the Best Seller chart, at #11; on the Juke Box chart, at #13; on the composite chart of the top 100 songs, it reached #13. The flip side was "Mostly Martha".
Dick Glasser re-recorded the song after having signed with Columbia Records by Autumn 1958. It was released as his third single for the label (#41357) about March 1959, this time flipped with "Get Thee Behind Me".

Bahiopsis parishii

Bahiopsis parishii known commonly as Parish goldeneye or shrubby goldeneye, is a North American species of flowering shrubs in the family Asteraceae.
It is native to the southwestern United States, (southern California, southern Nevada, Arizona, and southwestern New Mexico), as well as adjacent parts of northwest Mexico (Baja California, Baja California Sur, and Sonora).
Description.
"Bahiopsis parishii" grows to 2 feet tall, with bright yellow flowers. It is a plant of desert areas, usually associated with creosote bush, and ranges from sea level to in elevation. It blooms after periods of rain, both in spring and in fall, or after the monsoon season in Arizona.
Etymology.
The species name honors either of two brothers, Samuel Bonsall Parish (1838–1928) and William Fletcher Parish (1840–1918), both active botanists in southern California. It is closely related to "Bahiopsis deltoidea" and is sometimes considered a variety of that species.

Pistou

Pistou (Provençal: "pisto" or "pistou" , ), or pistou sauce, is a Provençal cold sauce made from cloves of garlic, fresh basil, and olive oil and sometimes almonds, bread crumbs or potatoes. It is somewhat similar to the Ligurian sauce pesto, although it lacks pine nuts and cheese; some versions include cheese and/or almonds.
Etymology and history.
The "Dictionnaire de l'Académie française" dates "pistou" from the 20th century, and defines it as a Provençal word denoting a condiment made from fresh basil, crushed with garlic and olive oil; the term derives from (to grind) itself derived from the Latin (to pound, to grind).
The sauce is similar to Genoese pesto, which is traditionally made of garlic, basil, pine nuts, grated Sardinian pecorino, and olive oil, crushed and mixed with a mortar and pestle. The key difference between pistou and pesto is the absence of cheese in pistou.
Use.
Pistou is a typical condiment from the Provence region of France most often associated with the Provençal dish "soupe au pistou", which resembles minestrone and may include white beans, green beans, tomatoes, summer squash, potatoes, and pasta. The pistou is incorporated into the soup just before serving.
Gruyère cheese is used in Nice. Some regions substitute Parmesan cheese or Comté or sheep-cheese in Corsica . Whatever cheese is used, a "stringy" cheese is not preferred, so that when it melts in a hot liquid (like in the pistou soup, for instance), it does not melt into long strands.

Virginia State Route 87

State Route 87 (SR 87) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. Known for its entire length as Morehead Avenue, the state highway runs from the North Carolina state line, where the highway continues as North Carolina Highway 14 (NC 14)/NC 87, north to its terminus at U.S. Route 220 (US 220) in Ridgeway in southern Henry County.
Route description.
SR 87 begins at the North Carolina state line southeast of Ridgeway. The highway continues southeast as NC 14/NC 87 toward Eden. SR 87 heads northwest to the town of Ridgeway. In the center of town, the state highway intersects US 220 Business, which heads north on Main Street and south on Church Street. SR 87 continues northwest a short distance to its northern terminus at US 220 (Greensboro Road).
History.
Route 87 was originally numbered State Route 106. When North Carolina extended NC 87 to the Virginia state line in the 1940 renumbering, SR 106 was renumbered SR 87 for continuity.

Gaston Calmette

Gaston Calmette (30 July 1858 – 16 March 1914) was a French journalist and newspaper editor, whose murder was the subject of a notable murder trial.
Biography.
Calmette was born in Montpellier. He was educated at Nice, Bordeaux, Clermont-Ferrand and Mâcon, and afterwards entered journalism. In 1884 he joined the staff of "Le Figaro", and in 1894 became its editor. In January 1914, Calmette launched a campaign against Minister of Finance Joseph Caillaux, who had introduced progressive taxation and was known for his pacifist stance towards Germany during the Second Moroccan Crisis, in 1911. Almost every day "Le Figaro" produced evidence of a damaging sort against the minister with the object of proving that he used his official position to facilitate speculation on the Paris Bourse. The attitude of Caillaux in the Rochette case of 1911, in which it was alleged by "Le Figaro" that the director of public prosecutions had been influenced by the ministry to delay the course of justice, was brought forward, and a newspaper campaign of extraordinary violence was the result. Caillaux was urged by some of his colleagues to take legal proceedings against his accusers, but declined.
Joseph Caillaux had to resign his post the 11 January 1912. 
Assassination.
At 6:00 p.m. on 16 March 1914, Calmette entered the offices of "Le Figaro" in the company of his friend, the novelist Paul Bourget. Caillaux's second wife Henriette was waiting for him, wearing a fur coat and with her hands in a fur muff. To Bourget's surprise, Calmette agreed to see her in his office.
There, Madame Caillaux exchanged a few words with him, then pulled out a .32 Browning automatic pistol she had been concealing within the muff and fired six shots. Calmette was hit four times and was critically wounded, dying six hours later. Caillaux made no attempt to escape and newspaper workers in adjoining offices quickly summoned a doctor and the police. She refused to be transported to the police headquarters in a police van, insisting on being driven there by her chauffeur in her own car, which was still parked outside. The police agreed to this and she was formally charged upon reaching the headquarters. In court she was acquitted from all allegations. 
During the campaign against Joseph Caillaux, which was orchestrated by Louis Barthou and Raymond Poincaré, "Le Figaro" published several letters from the Minister's private correspondence. Madame Caillaux's motive was fear that the newspaper would also make public a love letter that showed how her husband was already having a relationship with her during his first marriage.
Other interests.
Calmette was well known for his interest in art, and possessed a fine collection of caricatures and engravings of the First Empire.
Popular culture.
Robert Delaunay used an illustration of the assassination as the basis for his 1914 painting "Political Drama".
Marcel Proust dedicated "Swann's Way", the first volume of his novel "In Search of Lost Time", to Calmette 'as a testimony of deep and affectionate recognition'.
Calmette was the brother of the bacteriologist Albert Calmette.

Dick Glasser

Richard Eugene Glasser (December 8, 1933 – July 10, 2000) was an American singer, songwriter, and record producer.
Biography.
Glasser was born in Canton, Ohio, the third of eleven children and the oldest of five boys: subsequent to graduating Minerva High School he served in the navy. His biggest hit as a songwriter was "Angels in the Sky", which he recorded and released on Jack Gale's Triple-A label in early 1954. RCA Records subsequently made an offer to Gale for the song and gave it to their singer Tony Martin that same year. The deal also involved Gale pulling the Glasser original off the market. The following year, the song was revived by The Crew-Cuts on Mercury and their version sold a million copies.
Glasser went on to release many excellent recordings during the mid to late 50s on Dot, Argo, then Columbia, before moving to Liberty in 1960 where he was appointed head of Metric Music—Liberty's song publishing arm. In January 1961 Gene Vincent recorded the Glasser song "Teardrops", and released it on Capitol. Aside from running Metric, Glasser also released eight singles for the label, the pick being "Handsome Guy", a 1962 recording produced by Snuff Garrett and written by P.J. Proby under his real name, James Marcus Smith. The record was a top 10 hit for him that year in Australia. He also did session work for the label as a guitarist.
Also in 1962, Glasser produced a record by an instrumental band called The Fencemen, composed of Oklahoma expatriates Chuck Blackwell, David Gates, and Leon Russell. Although the musicians went on to individual fame and success,"Swingin' Gates" (written by David Gates and Cliff Crofford) b/w "Bach n' Roll" (written by Leon Russell [as Russell Bridges]) failed to chart. The Fencemen released a second single in early 1963, "Sunday Stranger" (written by Billy Strange) b/w "Sour Grapes" (written by David Gates), which also went nowhere.
From January 1964, Glasser was general manager of Liberty's Dolton label where he produced recordings for such acts as Vic Dana, the Fleetwoods, and the Ventures, including Dana's original version of "I Will" a much-recorded Glasser composition.
In June 1965, Glasser assumed A&amp;R directorship at Warner Bros. Records, producing a number of recordings by the Everly Brothers, including their "Two Yanks in England" album, as well as Freddy Cannon. March 1968 saw the launch of Dick Glasser Productions whose output included successful recordings by Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, the Vogues, and Andy Williams. Glasser also established his own music publishing company: Richbare Music, in 1968.
During the mid-1970s, Glasser was director of MGM Records' country music division in Nashville, producing C. W. McCall's worldwide 1975 hit "Convoy", and also Eddy Arnold and Hank Williams Jr.
Among artists who recorded his songs were Bobby Vee, PJ Proby, Chet Atkins ("I Will"), Walter Brennan, Glen Campbell, Billy Fury, Johnny Cash ("That's All Over"), Dean Martin ("I Will"), Buddy Greco, The Kingston Trio, The Ventures ("Bluer Than Blue"), and Ruby Winters ("I Will"). Deana Martin recorded her own version of her father, Dean Martin's, recording on her 2009 album “Volare”.
Glasser died of lung cancer in Thousand Oaks, California at the age of 66.

Pattillo Higgins

Pattillo Higgins (December 5, 1863 – June 5, 1955) was an American businessman and a self-taught geologist. He earned the nickname the "Prophet of Spindletop" for his endeavors in the Texas oil business, which accrued a fortune for many. He partnered to form the Gladys City Oil Gas and Manufacturing Company, and later established the Higgins Standard Oil Company.
Early life.
Pattillo Higgins was born to Roberto James and Sarah (Raye) Higgins on December 5, 1863, in Sabine Pass, Texas. His family moved to Beaumont when he was six years old. He attended school until he reached the fourth grade, after which he apprenticed as a gunsmith under his father's direction. In his youth, he was a violent troublemaker, pulling pranks and harassing African Americans.
When he was seventeen, he pulled a prank on a black Baptist church that got the attention of a sheriff's deputy. The deputy fired a warning shot over Higgins' head, after which Higgins fired back and delivered what would later turn out to be a fatal hit. The wounded deputy managed to fire again, striking Higgins in his lower left arm. Higgins' arm would later become severely infected, requiring amputation from the elbow down. Higgins was put on trial for the murder of the deputy, but he would be found not guilty by a jury that perceived his act as self-defense. After his acquittal, he worked as a logger along the Texas-Louisiana border, apparently unhindered by his lack of an arm.
It was in 1885 that he attended a Baptist revival meeting where he made the decision to become a Christian. Realizing that the lumber camps were not the ideal place to maintain a good morality, he decided to return to Beaumont, Texas to establish himself as a businessman.
Venture into business.
Higgins ventured into real estate at first, and with the money that he saved as a logger, he started the Higgins Manufacturing Company to manufacture bricks. The business sparked his interest in oil and gas, as he used it for his kilns to burn the bricks evenly. He decided to travel to Pennsylvania to learn about these fuels and study the geographical features that give signs to the presence of underground oil. Studying geology on his own, he dedicated himself to finding these clues by reading all the United States Geological Survey reports and books that he could find. The details he learned reminded him of what some Beaumont locals back home referred to as "Sour Hill Mound", a place where he frequently brought his Sunday school students for outings. This mound was described as "sour" due to the unpleasant sulfur smell that came out of the springs around it. Convinced that this salt dome mound had oil below it, Higgins first partnered with George O'Brien, George Carroll, Emma John, and J.F. Lanier to form the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company in 1892. It was during this time that other formally trained geologists dismissed the idea of finding oil along the gulf coast region of the United States. Higgins' personal integrity was even challenged by the local newspaper. However, his informal training in geology influenced his belief that the Spindletop field contained oil below due to the presence of mineral water and gas seepage, and he managed to convince the partners to proceed with the venture. Work began the following year, but all three of the shallow drilling attempts failed to locate oil due to the shifting sands and unstable clay under the hill. Higgins resigned from the company, sold his stock, and purchased 33 acres compromising the summit of Sour Spring Mound.
Partnership with Anthony Lucas.
Unwilling to give up hope of striking oil, Higgins placed numerous ads in industrial magazines and trade journals in an effort to spark others' interests in the prospect of hitting a successful well at the site. Only one man responded to the ads, a Croatian-American named Anthony Francis Lucas. Lucas signed agreements with the Gladys City Company and also with Higgins in 1899, and in June of the following year, he began to drill. The first well Lucas made with his light equipment collapsed after reaching . This failure exhausted the partners' finances, so Lucas turned to John H. Galey and James M. Guffey in Pittsburgh for backing. The terms set forth by Guffey (who held and controlled the funds) limited Lucas’ percentage cut to a small amount, and eliminated Higgins and cut him completely from the deal.
The Lucas Gusher at Spindletop.
In late October 1900, with the help of the experienced crew of Al and Curt Hamill from Corsicana, drilling began again. This time, the drilling would be done using a newer, heavier, and more efficient rotary type bit. Over the next several months, work was difficult maintaining the drilling through the underground sands. On January 10, 1901, the six tons of four-inch (102 mm) drilling pipe began to shoot up out of the hole, sending the roughnecks fleeing for safety. The geyser shot oil over high and flowed an estimated . 
The well was at a depth of , and as it turns out, was at the precise location as initially predicted by Higgins. The well would not have struck oil if it had been drilled just 50 feet (15 m) to the south. The well, which was dubbed "Lucas 1", had an initial flow rate greater than all of the oil wells in the United States combined in that day. The Spindletop oilfield churned out over the first year of operation, and over the following year. This effectively brought an end to John D. Rockefeller’s world monopoly.
Lawsuit against Lucas and the Gladys City Company.
Higgins sued Lucas and Gladys City Oil, Gas and Manufacturing Company for royalties, using the basis that the second lease was invalid because the first lease had not yet expired when the second was enacted. After the parties settled out of court, Higgins formed the Higgins Oil and Fuel Company located at the center of Spindletop. This company was vulnerable to takeover bids due to Higgins' over-zealous land prospecting, which enabled the lumber baron and businessman John Henry Kirby to overtake his ownership in 1902 by purchasing his shares of the company for $3 million. Higgins maintained his leasing rights to his land, and would establish the Higgins Standard Oil Company. He later established other wells with various investors, with an eccentric habit of pulling his interests out, leaving the majority of the profits for others.
Later life and death.
Higgins' lifestyle was varied in interests and occupations. Along with working as a wildcatter, his diverse activities involved drafting, work as an inventor, an artist, as well as an engineer to name a few. His religious beliefs kept him away from public entertainment and resorts, as well as maintaining a strong belief against the selling of alcohol. In addition to residing in Beaumont, he owned estates in Houston and San Antonio. He remained a bachelor until the age of 45. In 1905, he adopted a young woman named Annie Jahn, who at the time was fifteen. Three years later Higgins married her, and later had three children with her, despite the scandal. Higgins died in San Antonio on June 5, 1955.

Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)

Pennies from Heaven is a 1981 American musical romantic drama film directed by Herbert Ross, based on the 1978 BBC television drama. Dennis Potter adapted his screenplay from the BBC series for American audiences, changing its setting from London and the Forest of Dean to Depression-era Chicago and rural Illinois.
The film stars Steve Martin, Bernadette Peters, Christopher Walken and Jessica Harper. Choreographed by Danny Daniels, the film includes musical numbers consisting of actors lip-syncing and dancing to popular songs of the 1920s–30s, such as "Let's Misbehave", "Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries", "Let's Face the Music and Dance" and the title song.
While positively received by critics, it was a box office bomb, grossing just a fraction of its budget. It received 3 nominations at the 54th Academy Awards, but didn't win any of them.
Plot.
In 1934, Chicago sheet-music salesman Arthur Parker is going through hard times. His business is failing, and his wife Joan refuses to give him the money she inherited from her father to start his own business.
Arthur's dream is to live in a world that is like the songs he tries to sell. He is refused a bank loan, although he fantasizes that he gets it. In his travels, Arthur meets schoolteacher Eileen Everson and falls in love with her instantly. They embark on a short affair, but Arthur leaves her and returns to Joan, who is desperate to keep him and agrees to give him the money he wanted. Arthur denies having an affair, though Joan is sure he is lying.
Eileen gets pregnant by Arthur and is fired. With nowhere to go, she takes up with stylish pimp Tom. Eileen is attracted to Tom's "badness", and he arranges for her to have an abortion.
When Arthur meets Eileen again, she is now a prostitute calling herself "Lulu". They resume their romance, and Eileen leaves Tom and her sordid life. Impulsively, Arthur convinces her to run away with him. Having failed to sell his business, Arthur and Eileen break into the store one night and trash it, smashing its phonograph records (except for "Pennies from Heaven"). To supplement their income, Eileen keeps prostituting in spite of Arthur's objections.
A blind girl whom Arthur knew superficially is raped and murdered by an accordion-playing hobo to whom Arthur had once given a ride. The police suspect Arthur, and Joan tells them that he has sordid sexual proclivities to get back at him for cheating on her. The police find Arthur trying to leave town with Eileen, and arrest him for murder; he is soon convicted and sentenced to death. At the gallows, he recites the lyrics from the song "Pennies from Heaven". In one final fantasy, Arthur and Eileen are reunited, with Arthur saying, "We couldn't have gone through all that without a happy ending. Songs ain't like that, are they?"
Production.
"Pennies from Heaven" was Steve Martin's first dramatic role in a film. He had watched the original miniseries and considered it "the greatest thing [he'd] ever seen." He trained for eight months learning to tap dance, while Christopher Walken, who had trained as a dancer as a young man, was able to use his dancing skills in the film.
According to a 1990 article in "The Times", Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had Dennis Potter rewrite the script 13 times and required him to buy back his copyright from the BBC, for which he paid the BBC "something over $100,000". In addition, MGM prohibited broadcast of the BBC's original production for 10 years. Around 1989, at the prompting of Alan Yentob, the controller of BBC2, producer Kenith Trodd was able to buy back the rights from MGM for "a very inconsiderable sum." In February 1990, the BBC rebroadcast the original "Pennies from Heaven" serial for the first time since 1978.
In the same "Times" article, Trodd stated that Bob Hoskins and Cheryl Campbell, the stars of the original series, "were terribly upset that they weren't considered for the film. I think they still blame Dennis and me in some way, but there was no way to argue the point with MGM."
The style of the movie balances the drab despair of the Depression era and the characters' sad lives with brightly colored dream-fantasy lavish musical sequences. The characters break into song and dance to express their emotions. For example, Eileen Everson (Bernadette Peters) turns into a silver-gowned torch singer in her school-room, with her students lip-synching and dancing ("Love Is Good for Anything That Ails You"). Tom (Walken) seduces Eileen with a tap dance/striptease routine on top of a bar ("Let's Misbehave"). Arthur Parker (Martin) and Eileen go to a film ("Follow the Fleet") and wind up dancing in formal wear, first with, then in, a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical number from the film, "Let's Face the Music and Dance". All the songs are lip-synched, except Martin singing/speaking the title song at the end, but Arthur, Tom, and Eileen dance.
Four paintings are recreated as "tableaux vivants" in the film: "Hudson Bay Fur Company" and "20 Cent Movie" by Reginald Marsh, and "New York Movie" and "Nighthawks" by Edward Hopper. Three of the four were painted after 1934, when the movie takes place, and all depict scenes in New York City rather than the Chicago setting of the movie.
Reception and legacy.
Box office.
The film was a commercial failure, grossing slightly more than $9 million at the box office against a budget of $22 million.
When asked in "Rolling Stone" about the film's box office failure, Martin said: "I'm disappointed that it didn't open as a blockbuster and I don't know what's to blame, other than it's me and not a comedy. I must say that the people who get the movie, in general, have been wise and intelligent; the people who don't get it are ignorant scum."
David Begelman, head of MGM, called it "the most daring film we made. It took all these different textures and molded them... I didn't make that picture because I enjoy walking a tightrope. I made that picture because with every honest conviction you can bring to bear, I believed that film could become a film of such incredible celebrity it would enjoy very wide success. I was wrong. I was completely wrong."
It was Martin's second starring role in a film, following 1979's comedy hit "The Jerk", and fans were confused to see Martin in a serious role. "You just can't do a movie like "Pennies from Heaven" after you have done "The Jerk"," Martin said in a BBC interview.
"Everything I had done until that time had been wildly successful," he recalled in 1987, "so that the commercial failure of the film caught me by surprise. I still think artistically it's a very good film. I've rarely seen a role that showed that kind of vulnerability in a man. It's a special film to me, and if I had to find fault, it would be that I think some of the music could have included more popular songs of the period."
Critical response.
The film was given a rapturous review by Pauline Kael in "The New Yorker", writing ""Pennies from Heaven" is the most emotional movie musical I've ever seen. It's a stylized mythology of the Depression which uses the popular songs of the period as expressions of people's deepest longings—for sex, for romance, for money, for a high good time...there was never a second when I wasn't fascinated by what was happening on the screen." Kael further noted that "The dance numbers are funny, amazing, and beautiful all at once; several of them are just about perfection." Gary Arnold of "The Washington Post" called it "a rejuvenating, landmark achievement in the evolution of Hollywood musicals, and certainly the finest American movie of 1981. A brilliantly enhanced distillation of a 1978 British television play, "Pennies" blends the astringent with the poignant and the fanciful. It appears as a belated Hollywood counterpart to Brecht and Weill's "Three Penny Opera"."
Other contemporary reviews were less positive. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and called it "all flash and style and no heart." Vincent Canby of "The New York Times" reported that he watched the film "with what might best be described as baffled interest." He wrote that "All of the musical numbers are good, and a couple are great...The movie, though, is not easy to respond to. It's chilly without being provocative in any intellectual way." Todd McCarthy of "Variety" wrote ""Pennies from Heaven" is one of the most hopelessly esoteric big-budget Hollywood pictures ever made, a lugubrious, neo-Brechtian musical exercise of notable pretension and virtually no artistic payoff...In short, it's "Penny Gate"." Dave Kehr of the "Chicago Reader" wrote that "ironic, alienating musicals have been tried before, but never with such lofty contempt for the form. [The film] drips with a sense of anger and betrayal that seems wildly out of scale to its cause - the discovery (less than original) that musicals don't reproduce social reality." Gene Siskel of the "Chicago Tribune" gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that "Martin ruins what could have been one of the year's freshest and most innovative films. With Martin hamming it up, "Pennies from Heaven" is full of socko moments, but the entire film doesn't hold together." Kevin Thomas of the "Los Angeles Times" wrote that "it is like no other period musical. It is so far out, so unexpected, that it might well be described as experimental...As such, it's likely to elicit deeply divided reactions: Audiences will either love it or hate it."
Peters won the Golden Globe as Best Motion Picture Actress in a Comedy or Musical for her role as Eileen Everson, a schoolteacher turned prostitute at the 39th Golden Globe Awards. A review of the DVD reissue asserted, "Peters brought a cocky attitude and a sexy exuberance to the musical numbers."
Fred Astaire, who was powerless to prevent the reuse of the footage from his film "Follow the Fleet", detested "Pennies from Heaven": "I have never spent two more miserable hours in my life. Every scene was cheap and vulgar. They don't realize that the '30s were a very innocent age, and that [the film] should have been set in the '80s – it was just froth; it makes you cry it's so distasteful."
The film was nominated by the American Film Institute for its 2006 list of Greatest Movie Musicals.

Effie Waller Smith

Effie Waller Smith (January 6, 1879 – January 2, 1960) was an African-American poet of the early twentieth century. Her published output consisted of three volumes of poetry: "Songs of the Month" (1904), "Rhymes From the Cumberland" (1904), and "Rosemary and Pansies" (1909). Her poetry appeared in the publication "Harper's Weekly" and various regional newspapers.
Early life and education.
Effie Waller was born to former slaves in the rural mountain community of Chloe Creek in Pike County, Kentucky, on a farm located a few miles from Pikeville. Her father, Frank Waller, migrated to the East Kentucky mountains sometime after the Civil War, having spent most of his early life as a laborer on a Virginia plantation. Her mother, Sibbie Ratliff, was born and raised in East Kentucky and met the former Virginia slave in the early 1870s. Effie was the third of their four children.
Frank Waller established himself as both a blacksmith and a real estate speculator soon after his arrival in the Chloe Creek community. This mountain community was unique in comparison to other communities of the time in that it was racially integrated. This condition, coupled with Waller's early training as a blacksmith while still a slave, helped him to become financially successful and to win the respect of his neighbors, both white and black. The Wallers, realizing the hardships caused by their own limited education, decided that their children would receive the best quality education available to them at the time.
Effie completed eighth grade at a local school, as her older siblings Alfred and Rosa had done, then attended Kentucky Normal School for Colored Persons in Frankfort, and from 1900 to 1902 trained to be a teacher, after which she is known to have taught school off and on for several years, in Kentucky and in Tennessee. That same year she married a man called Lyss Cockrell but the marriage did not last long, ending in her divorcing him. In 1908 she married again, to Deputy Sheriff Charles Smith, but this union was also short-lived. He was killed in 1911 while serving a warrant.
Career.
Some of her verse appeared in local papers, and she published her first collection, "Songs of the Months", containing 110 poems, in 1904. In 1909 Effie Smith had published two further collections, "Rhymes From the Cumberland" and "Rosemary and Pansies", and in 1917, her sonnet "Autumn Winds" was published in "Harper's Magazine", but she appears to have stopped writing that year, when she was 38.
Effie Smith left Kentucky for Wisconsin in 1918. She died on January 2, 1960, and is buried in the city of Neenah.

European Son

"European Son", also known as "European Son (to Delmore Schwartz)", is a song written and performed by the American experimental rock band The Velvet Underground. It appears as the final track on their 1967 debut album "The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico". It is also the album's longest track at more than seven and a half minutes.
The song could be seen as a precursor to the band's next album "White Light/White Heat" and to the song "Sister Ray", a seventeen-minute-long rock improvisation.
Composition.
"European Son" is dedicated to poet Delmore Schwartz, who had been Lou Reed's advisor at Syracuse University. Wanting to dedicate a song to Schwartz, "European Son" was chosen because it had the fewest lyrics, as Schwartz made his distaste for rock lyrics clear.&lt;ref name="33 1/3"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first pressing of "The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico" referred to the song as "European Son (to Delmore Schwartz)".
The song was recorded in April 1966; Schwartz died alone in Manhattan three months later, on July 14. According to musicologist Richard Witts, the song "reads like little more than a song of loathing" to Schwartz, who refused to see Reed while living out his last days in seclusion in Midtown Manhattan. Witts highlighted obscure personal details in lyrics such as "You made your wallpapers green", and found the "Dylanesque" "hey, hey, bye bye bye" refrain "a malicious farewell to its subject".
Recording.
The song begins with two stanzas of lyrics sung by Lou Reed over a D major chord played by Reed and Sterling Morrison and a walking bassline played by John Cale; about one minute later, a loud crashing sound produced by Cale hitting a stack of plates with a metal chair is heard. Six minutes of instrumental improvisation, making extensive use of distortion and feedback, follow.
Influence.
"European Son" was an influence on the German krautrock band Can. Its influence can especially be heard on the song "Father Cannot Yell", the opening track of their 1969 debut album "Monster Movie", in which bassist Holger Czukay plays a similar bassline.
A slowed-down version of the song's bassline appears on "Moby Octopad" by Yo La Tengo.
Simple Minds recorded a song entitled "European Son" on a demo tape, which was released on CD on "The Early Years: 1977–1978". The band Japan also recorded a song with the title "European Son". Both these bands titled the song in tribute to the Velvet Underground song, and have covered other songs by the band (both covering "All Tomorrow's Parties", for one), but neither "European Son" is a cover of the Velvet Underground song.

I'll Be Your Mirror

"I'll Be Your Mirror" is a song by the Velvet Underground and Nico. It appeared on their 1967 debut album "The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico". It also surfaced as a single a year earlier with "All Tomorrow's Parties" in 1966.
Lou Reed wrote the song for Nico, who provides lead vocals. According to biographer Victor Bockris, inspiration for the song came about after Nico approached Reed after a show in 1965 saying, "Oh Lou, I'll be your mirror." The song was a favorite of Reed's and "The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico" engineer, Norman Dolph.&lt;ref name="33 1/3"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Mark Deming of AllMusic described "I'll Be Your Mirror" as an "understated love song."
Recording.
"I'll Be Your Mirror" was the most difficult for Nico to record, as the band wanted her to provide slender, delicate vocals for the song, yet she would sing louder, more aggressive vocals take after take. Sterling Morrison described the ordeal in an interview:
The members of the band enjoyed her particular performance on the song so much that after she left the band in late 1967, live vocals for the song were done imitating Nico's accent.
Mentor and manager Andy Warhol suggested that the album have a built-in scratch in it so the line "I'll be your mirror" would repeat infinitely on a record player until the listener moved the needle themselves, but nothing ever came of this idea.
Alternate versions.
Scepter Studios, April 1966.
A different mix of the song appears on the acetate cut of the Scepter Studios session, with an alternate track of more aggressive lead vocals by Nico. She also sings "to show that you're home" at the end of the second verse rather than "so you won't be afraid". The backing vocals that sing "reflect what you are" also are almost inaudible on this version of the song, and the guitar is louder.
Single version, July 1966.
A 45 rpm single version of the song was released in July 1966 with "All Tomorrow's Parties". The single is identical to the album cut except that it does not fade out at the end. Instead, it goes on for about five seconds ending with a guitar chord. This version of the song later became available in 2002 on the "Deluxe Edition" of "The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico".

There She Goes Again

"There She Goes Again" is a song by American rock band the Velvet Underground. It first appeared on their debut studio album, "The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico" (1967). The syncopated guitar riff is taken from the 1962 Marvin Gaye song "Hitch Hike". Guitarist Sterling Morrison has stated:
Metronomically, we were a pretty accurate band. If we were speeding up or slowing down, it was by design. If you listen to the solo break on "There She Goes Again," it slows down—slower and slower and slower. And then when it comes back into the "bye-bye-byes" it's double the original tempo, a tremendous leap to twice the speed.
Other artists have recorded the song, including R.E.M., who recorded it as a B-side on their 1983 single "Radio Free Europe" (and appeared on their B-side compilation "Dead Letter Office" in 1987). It was also included as a bonus track on the 1993 re-release of R.E.M.'s 1983 album "Murmur".

Florida East Coast 153

Florida East Coast 153 is a Florida East Coast Railway 4-6-2 ALCO steam locomotive located in Miami, Florida, USA.
History.
The locomotive served on the Florida East Coast Railway from 1922 to 1938 and pulled a train carrying President Calvin Coolidge to Miami in 1928. In 1935, when it was in use on the run between Miami and Key West, No. 153 was one of the last locomotives to reach Miami before the hurricane that year destroyed the bridges to the Florida Keys.
After 1938, No. 153 was used as an industrial switcher by the United States Sugar Corporation of Clewiston, Florida. In 1956, it was donated to the University of Miami. 
From March 1957 until November 1966, it operated a train called "Gold Coast Special" in Miami every Sunday. In 1966, it received a major overhaul, after which it was inspected and subsequently certified by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
For pulling the "rescue train" out of Marathon before the Labor Day Hurricane, #153 was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 21, 1985. Due to age and damage by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, it's been out of service since. It is located at the Gold Coast Railroad Museum, 12400 Southwest 152nd Street, Miami, FL.

Entering a New Ride

Entering a New Ride is the ninth and final album by Big Audio Dynamite (aka BAD), recorded in 1999. Radioactive Records declined to release the album, so in 2001 the band decided to post the tracks on its website. In this way, the album is one of the earliest internet-distributed albums. To support this self-release by the band many fans and media creators became involved centered upon a discussion board on the BAD website. Among these was filmmaker and interactive media producer Krishna Stott, who created the interactive film "NTR", a noir-ish story written by Tim Birch, starring actor Wayne Simmonds, and featuring three of the albums tracks. This guerrilla film was distributed using the then new technology of CD-ROM.
"Must Be the Music" is a cover of the 1982 hit by Secret Weapon.
"NTR" interactive film (2001).
The album was released online during the early days of the internet on the Big Audio Dynamite website, with fans and media creators becoming actively involved in promoting the self-release. Activities centred upon the BAD website discussion board, with fans, creators, and band-members cooking up plans. The most significant outcome of these activities was initiated by filmmaker and interactive media producer Krishna Stott who created the interactive film "NTR" (2001). Written by Tim Birch and starring the actor Wayne Simmonds, it was a film noir-ish story of Rude Boy - a character created by Simmonds, and the film used a collage of clips from Simmonds’ own video art projects to create the narrative. The film featured three tracks from the album: 'Man, That Is Dynamite!', 'Taking You To Another Dimension', and 'Get High'. Burnt onto the then new but increasing popular technology of CD-ROM, this guerrilla film was distributed to promote the album amongst fans and the media.

Diego de Villalba y Toledo, marqués de Campo, señor de la Villa de Santacruz de Pinares was a Spanish general of artillery and colonial governor in America. From 1667 to 1671 he was governor of New Kingdom of Granada – "Nuevo Reino de Granada" – (greater Colombia), then part of the Viceroyalty of Peru.
Villalba y Toledo was a knight of the Order of Santiago and majordomo of Juan José of Austria, son of Spanish King Philip IV. From 1647 to 1653 Villalba was governor of Cuba.
In 1667 he became governor of Nuevo Reino de Granada (New Granada). During his administration the Grand Bridge over the Bogotá River was completed, and also a bridge over the Río Gualí at Honda. These were constructed by Indigenous labor. He traveled to Cartagena de Indias to inspect its defenses after the English pirate Henry Morgan attacked the Castle of San Felipe in 1668. At the same time, there were reports that the French also planned a landing in New Granada.
Because of a shortage of coinage in New Granada, Villalba ordered the silver bars be melted down to make coins of one quarter and one half real.
There was a variety of complaints to the Crown against Villalba's administration, and Bishop Melchor Liñán y Cisneros was appointed "visitador" (inspector) to investigate them. The bishop ordered that Villalba be arrested and confined in Villa de Leiva. There were 70 charges against him, and he was convicted of robbing the dead. On 2 June 1671, Liñán y Cisneros replaced him on a temporary basis as governor and captain general of New Granada. Liñán y Cisneros later became viceroy of Peru.
Villalba y Toledo died in Seville.

Port Orange Florida East Coast Railway Freight Depot is a historic Florida East Coast Railway passenger depot in Port Orange, Florida, United States. It is located at 415C Herbert Street, off U.S. 1. The depot was originally constructed in 1894 as two buildings.
The depot was constructed by the narrow-gauge St. Johns and Halifax Railway, a division of the Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Indian River Railway.
On December 31, 1885, Henry Flagler purchased the Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Indian River Railway. In September 1895, he changed the name to the Florida East Coast Railway.
The initial buildings included a passenger depot, FEC building #245, which was built immediately south of Dunlawton Avenue with the platform facing north. A second building, a freight depot, FEC building #246, was constructed south of the passenger depot. In 1924, the two buildings were joined as a passenger station. Regular passenger service ended in 1932. In February 1938, the building was remodeled to its current appearance. The windows, pedestrian doors and waiting platform were removed.
The building continued to be used as a freight depot until 1964. The depot continued to be a flag stop until the strike on January 23, 1963, and is listed in the last pre-strike time table dated December 12, 1962. In 1966 the depot was purchased and moved 500 feet north. The depot was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 5, 1998. In 2015 the City of Port Orange purchased the depot from long time Port Orange resident and business owner Bryan Berntsen to restore the building.

Gay naturism

Gay naturism or LGBTQ naturism (where naturism is generally equated with "nudism") concerns a lifestyle of gay people in which nudity, especially in a communal context, is viewed as natural, positive and healthy. While naturist clubs and resorts in the United States date back to the 1930s, gay naturist organizations did not emerge until the early 1980s. Separate from official naturist clubs, gay individuals have long congregated in locally-known gay beaches in many countries, especially in Europe and North America.
Early history.
In the early 1980s, a number of unaffiliated local clubs for gay naturists began independently springing up in major metropolitan areas of the United States and Canada. By that time, many major cities were served by LGBT newspapers that were established during the gay liberation movement of the 1970s. These papers—e.g., L.A. Frontiers, Seattle Gay News and the Houston Voice—were important means of spreading the word about the first wave of gay naturist social clubs. Among the oldest and largest of the clubs that are still extant are Males au Naturel (MAN) in New York, Los Angeles Nude Guys (LANG), San Francisco Kindred Nudists (SKiNS), and the Greater Atlanta Naturist Group (GANG).
The first nationwide organization to promote gay naturism also originated in the early 1980s. In 1980, Lee Baxandall founded The Naturist Society (TNS). In contrast to the more conservative American Sunbathing Association (ASA) (which in 1995 was renamed the American Association for Nude Recreation, or AANR), TNS openly welcomed diverse groups of people and was a loose association of special interest groups (SIGs). According to Baxandall, from its inception TNS received almost daily inquires about a SIG for gay naturists. Baxandall approached Murray Kaufman (d. 2003), an openly gay New Yorker who had been hosting private nude socials for gay men in his home. Kaufman agreed to oversee a gay SIG for TNS, and Gay and Lesbian Naturists (GLN) was formed in 1983. GLN had its first gathering at the Summit Lodge in Rockbridge, Ohio in 1985. About 60 members, all of them men, attended.
Growth in the 1990s.
Annual GLN gatherings grew steadily in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1992, the group reorganized, with two key changes: it became an independent entity (no longer a SIG of TNS); and it was renamed Gay Naturists International (GNI). Although GLN had been founded with the intent of attracting both gay men and lesbians, it had been a de facto all-male organization as there had never been any significant lesbian participation in the group. The new GNI became gender specific in its mission. GNI also became an umbrella organization for networking local gay naturist clubs.
In 1994, there was a schism in GNI due to a legal dispute over records and money with respect to the paid employee. Out of this split, the employee in question founded International Men Enjoying Naturism (IMEN). Its goals were similar to those of GNI, including being a registry of local clubs, providing referrals to local groups, helping new local gay naturist groups organize, and holding an annual gathering. He was later terminated in a similar fashion from IMEN over the same issues.
The number of local gay naturist clubs continued to grow in the 1990s, particularly the latter part of the decade. GNI and IMEN provided organizational assistance to new clubs, and the advent of the Internet meant greater publicity opportunities for new and existing clubs. The website "Spike's Naked Planet" lists over 100 gay naturist clubs in the United States, about half a dozen in Canada and a scattering in other places across the world.
Annual gay naturist gatherings.
The 1990s saw the beginning of annual gay naturist gatherings on a large scale. GNI held its first gathering under its new name in 1992. The annual GNI Gathering, held each August in rural eastern Pennsylvania, remains the largest gay naturist gathering, attracting about 800 gay naturists. The second largest gathering, the CMEN Gathering, is sponsored by California Men Enjoying Naturism and is held each September in Malibu, California. First held in 1999, CMEN now draws about 500 attendees. Three other gatherings attract a few hundred attendees each. The IMEN Gathering, held each July in rural eastern Maryland, began in 1995. The East Coast Gathering, sponsored by the Philadelphia Area Naked Guys, is held each May in rural eastern Maryland. The Midwest Male Naturist Gathering” began in 1993 and is held in rural eastern Kansas each June. Key West's Bone Island Bare It All Weekend is held each July and December, attracting between 300 and 500 men.
Gay naturist vacation market.
In the United States, Palm Springs, California and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida have emerged as the leading vacation destinations for gay naturists. Both cities have a comparable number—about 25 in each—of small, all-gay resorts and guesthouses that allow either unrestricted nudity or at least poolside nudity. Key West, Florida is recognized as an early leader in the development of clothing-optional all-gay guesthouses. Key West currently has ten clothing-optional guesthouses as well as gay bars with clothing-optional areas. The majority of men-only gay accommodations throughout the world allow some degree of naturism, especially poolside, if there is sufficient privacy. However, there are no gay naturist resorts on the scale of co-ed, family oriented naturist resorts such as Cypress Cove in Florida.
Puglia in Italy has become an extremely popular destination for gay naturists with two popular naturist beaches at Spiaggia D’Ayala, Campomarino di Maruggio and at Torre Guaceto, Brindisi. Both have extensive gay sections. Additionally there are spots up and down Puglia's coast where nude bathing coincides with predominantly, but not exclusively, gay and gay-friendly locals.
Gay naturism in the United Kingdom.
A community website offers social networking for men looking to connect with other men also interested in male naturism together with member organised events, site organised events and an annual NakedFest weekend camping festival, attracting over 400 attendees in 2014.
A number of gay naturist organisations have existed in the United Kingdom. Gymnos offered social get-togethers for members only in and around London, and regular nude swimming (closed down in March 2010) together with Gay London Swimmers (GLS) at a public swimming pool in Camberwell, South London (closed down in 2009). Certain nudist beaches have areas which are informally used by gay men.
Gay naturist publications.
The book "Naked Places, A Guide for Gay Men to Nude Recreation and Travel" was first published in 1997 and is in its fifth edition as of 2006. The now defunct "Naked Magazine" was published from 1994 - 2001. Additionally, GNI and IMEN produce quarterly magazines—the "GNI Informer" and "Naturist Gay-zette" respectively—that are distributed to members only.

Wellesley Hospital

The Wellesley Hospital was a teaching hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, affiliated with the University of Toronto. It was founded by Dr. Herbert Bruce as a private hospital, but became publicly operated in 1942.
History.
The Wellesley Hospital was opened as a 50-bed private hospital in 1911. The original hospital building at 13 Homewood Place had previously been the home of Frederic Thomas Nicholls.
In 1984, the Ross Tilley Regional Burn Centre was opened at the hospital, following extensive fund-raising by local firefighters and others.
The Wellesley Hospital was the primary care centre for HIV/AIDS patients in the Toronto area from 1988 until 2001.
It operated the second busiest emergency room in the downtown core of Toronto, 
It merged with the nearby Central Hospital to become the Wellesley Central Hospital.
The Wellesley Division of Wellesley Central Hospital was closed by the Ontario government on the recommendation of the Ontario Health Services Restructuring Commission and the bulk of its programs were transferred between 1998 and 2002 to St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. Its Arthritis &amp; Autoimmunity Research Centre was transferred to the University Health Network.
Post-closure.
After the hospital building was closed, the hospital corporation became the Wellesley Central Health Corporation (later known as the Wellesley Institute), which lists as its objectives "four strategic directions; development of the Wellesley Hospital lands, community based research and grants, capacity building through extensive training workshops and coalition development, and framing the urban health agenda through public policy."
Many historical aspects of the hospital, such as awards, photos, cornerstone and antique surgical collections were distributed to Toronto General Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital (and Archives) and a facade and E.R. fixtures and swing doors are included in Wellesley Central Place, the complex that was built at the site in 2007.

Winton Motor Raceway

Winton Motor Raceway is a motor racing track in Winton, near Benalla, Victoria, Australia.
History.
The Benalla Auto Club began planning for a permanent racing track around 1958, as a replacement for their existing track at Barjarg. In 1960 it was decided to build the track at Winton Recreation Reserve and the track was completed in twelve months. The circuit hosted its first race meeting on 26 November 1961. The circuit was immediately popular - a March 1965 meeting featuring the Neptune touring car and the Victorian Formula Two championship drew a crowd of approximately 10,000 spectators. The circuit length was extended prior to the 1997 round of the V8 Supercar championship and the upgrade included a new pit complex.
The circuit.
Winton Motor Raceway has a combination of long fast straights and twisty and tight bends. It is also known as "Australia's Action Track". Dick Johnson once described the circuit being "like running a marathon around your clothes-line".
The original circuit (now called the Winton Club Circuit) is in length and comprises 10 turns. The circuit was lengthened to with the cars turning left prior to the esses and a series of right hand turns added before the extension rejoins the original track at the esses. The long circuit is called the Winton National Circuit.
V8 Supercars.
The track was used as a round in the V8 Supercar series, hosting the Winton SuperSprint. The track was one of the more popular tracks in the series with spectators, especially those who live in the area. Easy access to the track and viewing areas made it very popular. It attracts some of the biggest crowds of any of the permanent race tracks in the series.
Although the circuit held various rounds of national championships such as the Australian Drivers' Championship and the Australian Sports Car Championship, Winton was not awarded a round of the Australian Touring Car Championship until the start of the Group A era in Australia in 1985. The first ATCC race was won by then triple-Bathurst 1000 winner Jim Richards in his JPS Team BMW 635 CSi. That race holds its place in ATCC/V8 Supercar history as not only the first all-Group A race in Australia, but the first ATCC win by BMW and the only race in history in which there were no Holdens on the grid.
Richards holds the record for most ATCC round wins at Winton with four, having won in 1985 and 1986 for BMW, while winning in 1990 and 1991 for Nissan.
Australian Drivers' Championship.
Winton has played host to 19 rounds of the Australian Drivers' Championship since 1980.
Australian Sports Car Championship.
Winton played host to a round of the Australian Sports Car Championship on 7 occasions between 1978 and 1985.
Australian Sports Sedan / GT Championship.
1980, 1981, 1997, 1998 and 2003 were run for Sports Sedans. 1982–1985 were run for GT style cars.
Australian Superbike Championship.
Winton Raceway is one of the most prominent Superbike races on the Australian Superbike Championship racing calendar. Winton Raceway has seen riders such as Mick Doohan, Kevin Magee and Mat Mladin ride regularly at the venue.
Formula X-treme Motorcycle Championship
Drift Attack.
Winton Raceway is one of Australia's most popular Drift circuits. It hosts Australia largest drift event Drift Attack. Drift Attack is promoted by the Victorian Drift Club and offers the largest Prize Pool in Australian Drifting and is contested by Australia's 32 best Drifters in the Pro class and 32 Drivers in the street class.
Lap records.
As of August 2024, the official race lap records at Winton Motor Raceway are listed as:

<doc id="6902934" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6902934" title="Ambundu">
Ambundu

The Ambundu (also Mbundu or Kimbundu) (Mbundu: or , singular: (distinct from the Ovimbundu) are a Bantu people who live on a high plateau in present-day Angola just north of the Kwanza River. The Ambundu speak Kimbundu, and most also speak the official language of the country, Portuguese. They are the second biggest ethnic group in the country and make up 25% of the total population of Angola.
The Ambundu nowadays live in the region stretching to the East from Angola's capital city of Luanda (see map). They are predominant in the Bengo and Malanje provinces and in neighbouring parts of the Cuanza Norte and Cuanza Sul provinces. The head of the main Ambundu kingdom was called a "Ngola", which is the origin of the name of the country Angola.
Language.
The Mbundu speak the Kimbundu language, which has two dialects: Akwaluanda and Ambakista. Spoken in Luanda in the west, "Akwaluanda" (also referred to as "Ambundu") developed from interactions between Kimbundu speakers and other ethnic groups in the region. Spoken in Ambacca in the east, Ambakista developed from interactions between Kimbundu speakers and Portuguese traders.
Origins.
The exact origin of the Mbundu people is unknown, but there are some oral traditions that were passed down through the generations. The first oral tradition says that the Mbundu came from "the great water." Many historians interpreted this as the Atlantic Ocean and cite their origin as Luanda Island. This oral tradition also speaks of five great ancestors of the Mbundu: Zundu dya Mbulu, the mother of the Ndongo people; Kajinga ka Mbulu, founder of the Mbondo Kingdom; Matamba a Mulu, mother of the Pende people; and Kongo dya Mbulu, founder of the Hungu people.
The second oral tradition records that a man named Mussuri rose from ironworker to king of the Mbundu. After marrying a woman named Ngola Inene, they are said to have birthed a daughter named Samba. Samba gave birth to 8 children, who later begot the Ndongo, the Mbondo, the Pende, the Hungu, the Lenge, the Imbangala, the Songo and the Libolo people.
The Pende people tell an oral tradition of a single ancestor named Ngola Kilanji, who ruled over hunters and warriors at Tandji in Milumbu near the Zambezi River. Then Ngola moved his people west towards the sea, creating villages, or "jingundu," along the way until they reached Luanda on the coast. He later unified his people with another group that was led by a master blacksmith named Bembo Kalamba and his wife Ngombe dia Nganda. Bembo's people introduced Ngola's people to farming, cattle-herding and weaving. This origin story maintains that Ngombe's daughters became the mothers of the Mbundu ethnic groups and that Ngola founded the Kingdom of Ndongo. The royal title "ngola" is said to be derived from his name. The symbol for iron, which is so called "ngola", is still used today by the Mbundu.
Early history.
They had been arriving in the Angola region from the early Middle Ages on, but the biggest part of the immigration took place between the 13th and 16th century C.E.. Kimbundu is a West-Bantu language, and it is thought that, in the Bantu migrations, the Ambundu have arrived coming from the North rather than from the East. The Bantu peoples brought agriculture with them. They built permanent villages and traded with the indigenous Pygmies and Khoi-San populations.
The Ambundu society consisted of local communities until the 14th century. Their society has always been matrilineal. Land was inherited matrilineally, and the descent system was matrilineal as well. Boys used to go and live in the villages of their maternal uncles, so as to preserve a matrilinear core to the village. Theoretically, the lineage was projected onto status, instead of individuals, which gave the system some flexibility. The latter feature is not found with neighbouring matrilineal peoples, like the Ovimbundu to the South, or the Bakongo to the North.
The name "Mbundu" was first used by the Bakongo, before it was adopted by the Ambundu themselves.
Portuguese invasion.
Kongo, which had been in contact with the Portuguese since 1482, held a monopoly on trade with this country. When Ndongo's king, or "ngola", tried to break this monopoly, this led to war, in which the Bakongo were defeated in 1556. Ndongo was now independent, and directly confronted Portugal's colonialism. It allied itself with Matamba against the country in 1590 but was defeated in 1614. Now, Ndongo itself became a target for the slave trade, and its population fled in large numbers to neighbouring states.
Queen Njinga was the daughter of a deceased Ndongo ngola. At the request of Mbandi, the reigning ngola and her brother, she negotiated a peace treaty with the Portuguese. The treaty gave substantial trade and religious advantages to Portugal but delivered Mbandi the throne in Ndongo. After five years, she had to flee from Portuguese troops to Matamba. She became queen of Matamba, a kingdom which was traditionally led by women, and turned it into the most powerful state in the region, and a big exporter of slaves. Matamba, and neighboring Kasanje, had monopolies in the slave trade, and started falling apart in the 19th century when this trade lost in importance. The rise of a new trade in ivory, rubber and wax, which avoided the old monopolies, reduced the power of central authority in the Ambundu states in this century.
The Portuguese defeated Matamba in 1836, and advanced to Kasanje by the middle of the century. Their actual influence, however, was quite limited due to the lack of people, money, and an efficient military. The Ambundu had opportunities to revolt or negotiate liberties. This changed at the end of the 19th century. European countries forced, out of economic, strategic, and nationalistic considerations, a tighter control over African territories. To protect their interests, the Portuguese sent a number of military expeditions into the areas, which they considered to be their colonies, and brought them under actual control. The last Ambundu tribe to be defeated were the NDembo. It took the Portuguese three years to subdue a NDembo revolt in 1910. In 1917 all of their territory was occupied, and they became part of the Portuguese colony of Angola.
Notable people of Mbundu descent.
The American actor Chris Tucker discovered on the PBS television programme "African American Lives" that his matrilineal DNA traced to Mbundu people in present-day Angola. Isaiah Washington, another American actor, has a genealogical DNA link to the Ambundu group through his paternal line.

Chub Sullivan

John Frank "Chub" Sullivan (January12, 1856September12, 1881) was an American Major League Baseball first baseman who played for three seasons: two with the Cincinnati Reds (1877–1878) and one with the Worcester Worcesters (1880). He was nicknamed "Chub", but was 6 feet tall and weighed a mere 164 pounds. During his career, he was a popular player, sometimes known as a clown for his antics, and an early pioneer of the slide.
Career.
Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Sullivan, as a 21-year-old rookie in 1877, was the tenth-youngest player to appear in a National League game during that season, replacing Charlie Gould at first base. Joining the team late in the season, he played in only eight games, and batted .250. He stayed on with the Reds for the 1878 season, leading the league in games played, assists by a first baseman, and fielding percentage (.975). A tough hitter to strike out, Chub also finished seventh in at bat to strikeout ratio (27.1 to 1).
Sullivan joined the Worcester minor league club for the 1879 season, and the team did very well in a championship tournament following the season, and decided to apply as a replacement team in the National League, when the Syracuse Stars folded following the 1879 season. The team was accepted, and joined the League for the 1880 season. Sullivan played in 43 games, the last season of his career, batted .259, and is credited with zero RBIs. Sullivan's career totals include 112 games played, 114 hits, 55 runs scored, 24 RBIs, and a batting average of .258.
Post-career.
Sullivan became ill before the next season began, and eventually died on September 12 in his hometown of Boston, Massachusetts at the age of 25 of consumption, later known as tuberculosis. His Worcester teammates wore a black crêpe on their jersey sleeves in his memory, for the 1881 season.

Schlage

Schlage ( ) is an American lock manufacturer founded in 1920 by Walter Schlage. Schlage was headquartered in San Francisco from its inception until it relocated to Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1997. Schlage also produces high-security key and cylinder lines Primus, Everest, and Everest Primus XP. Schlage is one of the most popular brands of consumer and commercial locks in the United States.
History.
The Schlage Manufacturing Company was founded by inventor Walter Schlage (d. 1946) in 1920 with the help of three businessmen who each contributed $10 to become equal partners. Walter Schlage had already secured several patents dating back to 1909, when he patented a doorknob that would also complete an electrical circuit so that, for instance, the lights would turn on when the door was opened. However, Schlage's key invention was the bored cylindrical lock, which evolved through several iterations, including a 1917 filing for a mortise mechanism which locked when the knob was tilted, one in April 1920 for a lock requiring one hole and a surface rabbet rather than a complex mortise pocket, and another the same year in October for a mortise with the lock mechanism activated by a button coaxial to the knob. This series would ultimately culminate in , filed in 1923, which was sold commercially as the Schlage "A" series lock. Schlage would later make a 1925 filing for a push button cylindrical lock fusing the two 1920 patents with the 1923 patent.
Schlage's first shop was at 229 Minna Street, and he moved to 461 Bush Street, where many of his key patents were developed. The first factory (in 1923) was at 49 Shotwell Street. Because the bored cylindrical lock had a decided ease of installation advantage over the contemporary mortise lock, demand for the Schlage-designed lock rose and the company would purchase land in Visitacion Valley in 1925, which would eventually become the company's Bayshore factory and administration complex. Eight buildings were eventually erected at the Bayshore complex, the first two of which (the Old Office and Plant 1) were dedicated in a ceremony on June 25, 1926 attended by dignitaries including Mayor James "Sunny Jim" Rolph.
Charles Kendrick took over as chief executive after making a sizable investment in the company, and served as chief through his retirement in 1969. During World War II, Schlage Lock manufactured shell casings and bomb rail fuses. After the war, the company supplied lock hardware to the Pan Am Building (1964) and the Bank of America Headquarters (1969) skyscrapers. The company was also busy post-war acquiring smaller hardware manufacturers, including the California Lock Company, Peabody Company, LCN Closers, the Von Duprin Factory, and the General Lock Company (Pontiac, Michigan). In 1974, the year the company was acquired by Ingersoll Rand, Schlage employed 1,600 and was the largest manufacturer in San Francisco. Schlage had just completed a move from the Old Office building to a three-story New Office located nearby, at the corner of Bayshore and Leland. Schlage remained an Ingersoll Rand subsidiary for nearly 40 years, until Schlage and other security hardware companies were spun off as part of Allegion, formed in December 2013.
After 73 years of operation, the Schlage Lock Co. Bayshore factory was closed in 1999. To settle an environmental lawsuit, the Bayshore factory site was transferred to Universal Paragon Corporation (UPC) from Ingersoll Rand in 2008. UPC owned an adjacent parcel on which it had intended to develop housing, but the groundwater had been contaminated by the Schlage Lock factory, and UPC filed suit seeking to make Ingersoll Rand responsible for cleanup. In May 2009, demolition began on the Schlage Bayshore site; though the original 1926 Spanish Colonial "Old Office", designed by local architect William Peyton Day will remain, the rest of the site is planned to become affordable, green housing.
Keyway types.
Like many lock manufacturers, Schlage uses milled complex keyway shapes to mechanically prevent some non-OEM keys from entering or operating a lock. New keyway designs may be protected for a limited time by patent protection, which expires after a set number of years.
There is no law against duplicating the reverse, numbered or quad-key blanks, which are not patented and are not protected against third-party manufacturing.
As of 2008, Primus keys are no longer protected by patents; therefore, anyone is free to duplicate them. The Everest patents expired in 2014.
Primus/Primus XP.
In addition to six cuts for standard locking mechanism, there are five side finger pins to operate the secondary sidebar lock. Primus keys will operate non-Primus locks within the same system. Primus blanks and keyways are slightly thinner to prevent the entry of non-Primus keys; however, even if a standard key is altered to allow entry, it will not operate Primus locks. This design was protected until 2007 under . The current generation Primus, called the Primus XP, is a slight modification to the original design and is protected until 2024 under . Schlage did not invent, nor do they hold the patents on, Primus or Primus XP. The design is licensed to Schlage by Bo Widen of Torshälla, Sweden, the inventor and patent holder.
Everest.
This design features a patented under groove in the keyway design, and was legally protected against cloning by utility patents until 2014. Relevant patents are: (December 2, 2016) and . Just like the classic series, Everest Primus keys can operate Everest non-Primus locks, but not the other way around. Everest Primus XP is an extension to Primus Everest and the XP design is protected until 2024 under . Schlage also offers an Everest 29 SL Cylinder, the only seven pin lock they make, along with their Everest 29 Family/Primus (6 pins). Schlage did not invent, nor do they hold the patents on, the Everest keys, which were designed and patented by Bo Widen and licensed to Schlage.
Obverse.
There are seven different keyways: C, CE, E, EF, F, FG, and G. There is also a special P keyway designed to accept any of the seven sectional keys and a special L key blank (35-101 L) designed to be accepted into all seven keyways. OEM L section blanks are made of stainless steel.
The older type, the common residential keyway, is known as 35-100C, which is a five-pin, C section.
Reverse (restricted).
This variation was a horizontal mirror image of obverse keyways, no longer offered in new key system, and not available with a Primus option.
Numbered or Paracentric (restricted).
This is a large family of keyways expressed as four numbers. Except for zeros, digits in the keyway designation cannot repeat; i.e. 3578, 1358 and 1200 are valid, but 1244 and 3300 are not. Primus cannot be implemented on this series. The digit 9 is not used. Each digit represents the presence of a notch in the keyway and a corresponding protrusion along the blade of the key. The odd digits 1, 3, 5, and 7 extend along the left side of the keyway as observed from the lock face from bottom to top. The even digits are likewise, on the right side. Generally, keyways are identified by four non-zero digits in ascending order. In a large master key system, keys with fewer than four protrusions can be used to enter more than one keyway. For example, key blank 1460 will fit lock cylinder 1246, 1346, 1467, etc.
Quad (restricted).
Expressed in four characters, such as WSTP, VTQP, etc. This is a very large family, available in Primus.
Key copying.
At the 2013 DEF CON conference, MIT students David Lawrence and Eric Van Albert released a piece of code that allows anyone to create a 3D-printable software model of any Primus key. With just a flatbed scanner and their software tool, they were able to produce precise models that they uploaded to the 3D-printing services Shapeways and , who mailed them working copies of the keys in materials ranging from nylon to titanium.
Smart home products.
Smart locks.
In 2013, Schlage launched the Connect deadbolt, a smart lock available in Z-Wave and Zigbee-enabled versions with compatibility with Amazon Alexa and Google Home. In 2015, it introduced the Sense deadbolt, a Bluetooth-enabled smart lock and its first to support Apple Home. The Connect and Sense deadbolts require a hub to connect to Wi-Fi. It introduced the Encode deadbolt in 2019, its first lock with built-in Wi-Fi. A latch lock variant called the Encode Lever was released in 2023. In 2022, it launched the Encode Plus deadbolt, which adds a Thread radio to work with Apple Home and was the first smart lock to support Apple's NFC home key standard. It announced the Sense Pro deadbolt in 2025, its first smart lock with support for Matter, ultra-wideband digital keys using the Aliro standard, and its first smart lock without a keyway.
Nexia Home Intelligence.
Nexia Home Intelligence is a home automation system that was launched by Schlage and Ingersoll Rand that allows users to remotely control and monitor home automation devices. A wireless network is created within the home and connects the wireless door lock to the internet. Using a smart-phone or a web-enabled computer, users can monitor and send commands to the Schlage Bridge, which communicates with Z-Wave enabled wireless locks, thermostats, lights, cameras, and other components within the home. There is a monthly fee associated with the Nexia Home Intelligence service.
Nexia Home Intelligence is no longer maintained by Schlage. It remained with Ingersoll Rand during the IR-Allegion spin-off process. Ingersoll Rand solely maintains the Nexia platform.
One of its key features is "depth control" which senses if someone else is using your assigned PIN: it then enhances its security by proceeding to lock out that same PIN number. All Schlage products that were designed for the Nexia platform work with major smart home platforms. All security features such as "depth control" work under certain conditions such as "HomeKit".

Mat Johnson

Mat Johnson (born August 19, 1970, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American fiction writer who works in both prose and the comics format. In 2007, he was named the first USA James Baldwin Fellow by United States Artists.
Life and career.
Johnson was born and raised in the Germantown and Mount Airy communities in Philadelphia
His mother is African-American and his father is Irish Catholic. Johnson attended Abington Friends School, Greene Street Friends School, West Chester University, University of Wales, Swansea, and ultimately received his B.A. from Earlham College. In 1993 he was awarded a Thomas J. Watson Fellowship. Johnson received his M.F.A. from Columbia University School of the Arts in 1999.
Johnson has taught at Rutgers University, Columbia University, Bard College, and "The Callaloo Journal" Writers Retreat. He was a faculty member at the University of Houston Creative Writing Program. He is currently a professor at the University of Oregon's Creative Writing Program.
Johnson's first novel, "Drop" (2000), was a coming-of-age novel about a self-hating Philadelphian who thinks he has found his escape when he takes a job at a Brixton-based advertising agency in London, UK. The work was a Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers selection; "Interview" magazine named Johnson as a "Writer on the Verge"; and "Drop" was listed among "Best Novels of the Year" by "Progressive Magazine."
In 2003, Johnson published "Hunting in Harlem" (2003), a satire about gentrification in Harlem and an exploration of belief versus fanaticism. "Hunting in Harlem" won the Zora Neale Hurston/Richard Wright Legacy Award for Novel of the Year in 2004.
Johnson made his first move into the comics form with the publication of the five-issue limited series "Hellblazer Special: Papa Midnite" (Vertigo 2005), where he took an existing character of the Hellblazer franchise and created an origin story that strove to offer depth and dignity to a character who was arguably a racial stereotype of the noble savage. The work was set in 18th-century Manhattan, and was based on the research that Johnson was conducting for his first historical work, "The Great Negro Plot".

Proinsias Mac Aonghusa

Proinsias Mac Aonghusa (23 June 1933 – 28 September 2003) was an Irish journalist, writer, TV presenter and campaigner. Born into an Irish-speaking household, Mac Aonghusa became one of the most noted Irish language broadcasters and journalists of the 20th century, appearing as the presenter of Irish-language programming for RTÉ, UTV and BBC and as a journalist for newspapers both domestic and international. Influenced by family friends Peadar O'Donnell and Máirtín Ó Cadhain as well as his own parents growing up, Mac Aonghusa pursued Irish republican and socialist politics as an adult and was heavily involved in the Labour Party during the 1960s, at one point serving as its vice-chairman. However, Mac Aonghusa's engagement in factionalism and infighting saw him expelled in 1967. Following the Arms Crisis of 1970, Mac Aonghusa became an ardent supporter of Charles Haughey, a relationship which later proved highly beneficial to Mac Aonghusa when Haughey gained control over Fianna Fáil in the 1980s and appointed Mac Aonghusa to a number of state-run positions. A prolific writer throughout his life, Mac Aonghusa continued to publish books up until his death.
Biography.
Early life.
Born in Salthill, Galway, County Galway in 1933, Mac Aonghusa was the son of Criostóir Mac Aonghusa, a writer and Irish language activist, and Mairéad Ní Lupain (De Lappe), a nurse and native Irish speaker. The eldest of four siblings, Mac Aonghusa grew up speaking Irish as his first language and allegedly did not learn English until the age of eleven. The Mac Aonghusa parents were left-wing Irish republicans who supported Fianna Fáil (his father at one time was a Fianna Fáil councillor) and associated with the like-minded Máirtín Ó Cadhain and Peadar O’Donnell.
Mac Aonghusa's parents split when he was ten years of age; his mother took his siblings away to Dublin while Mac Aonghusa and his father remained in Rosmuc, a remote village and part of the Galway Gaeltacht. As a teenager he was educated at Coláiste Iognáid (also known as St. Ignatius College), a bilingual school in Galway City.
Broadcasting and journalism career.
Upon leaving school, Mac Aonghusa first worked as an actor at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, performing in Irish language productions. In 1952 Mac Aonghusa became involved in Radio Éireann, first as an actor but later as a reader of short stories before advancing to becoming a newsreader, presenter and interviewer. As Mac Aonghusa advanced his career, he would work for RTÉ, UTV and BBC television from the 1960s. In 1962, Mac Aonghusa began presenting "An Fear agus An Sceal" (The Man &amp; his Story) on RTÉ television, an Irish language show which saw Mac Aonghusa interviewing a different guest of note about their life each episode. That same year Mac Aonghusa would win a Jacob's Award for An Fear agus an Sceal, which he continued to host until 1964.
As well as attracting awards, An Fear agus an Sceal also brought controversy; two interviews, one with Máirtín Ó Cadhain, one with Con Lehane, both criticised the measures practised by the Fianna Fáil government during World War II to suppress and imprison Irish republicans. In response, the Fianna Fáil government intervened with RTÉ and those episodes were not aired. This was not to be Mac Aonghusa only run-in with the Fianna Fáil government; after Mac Aonghusa recorded a programme in which he questioned the effectiveness of Ireland's civil defence measures in the face of nuclear war, then Minister for Defence Kevin Boland had the episode suppressed. Mac Aonghusa once again ran afoul of the Fianna Fáil government when after he criticised the party in his anonymous weekly political gossip column in the Sunday Independent, then Minister of Agriculture Neil Blaney saw to it that the column was dropped. Mac Aonghusa was not deterred and returned anonymously as "Gulliver" in the "Sunday Press" and a gossip column on the back page of The Hibernia Magazine.
The latter half of Mac Aonghusa's 1960s/70s broadcasting career was primarily associated with the Irish language current events show "Féach", which he both presented and edited. Mac Aonghusa resigned from Féach in 1972 following a bitter dispute with the broadcaster and commentator Eoghan Harris.
Political activism and career.
Influenced by O'Donnell and Ó Cadhain in his youth, Mac Aonghusa also pursued left-wing republican politics as an adult. In 1958 Mac Aonghusa became, alongside David Thornley, Noel Browne, Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, and Desmond Ryan, a member of the "1913 Club", a group which sought to ideologically reconcile Irish nationalism and socialism.
In 1959 Mac Aonghusa wrote a series of six articles for the Irish Times in which he vehemently opposed the Fianna Fáil government's proposal to abolish single transferable vote in Ireland in favour of First past the post voting. Mac Aonghusa contended that First-past-the-post voting gave too much influence to party bosses, while proportional representation gave even small minorities representation, preventing them from feeling excluded by the state such as nationalists in Northern Ireland. In the referendum held on the matter on 17 June 1959, voters rejected first past the vote by a margin of 2%. Fianna Fáil would attempt to repeal proportional representation again in the late 60s, at which point Mac Aonghusa once again threw himself into the fight, leading a group called "Citizens for PR". In the referendum of 1968, voters rejected the first past the post system by over 20%. Mac Aonghusa would later recall that his defence of proportional representation was his greatest achievement in politics.
Member of the Labour party.
In the 1960s both Mac Aonghusa and his wife joined the Sean Connolly branch of the Labour Party in Dublin. The branch had established a reputation as a haven for intellectuals who wanted a branch to themselves away from the many other Labour branches dominated by trade unionists. The branch came to advocate for expressly socialist policies (something previously avoided by the Labour party in conservative Ireland) combined with on-the-ground grass-roots campaigning. Through the Sean Connolly Branch, both Mac Aonghusa and his wife began to develop significant influence over the leader of the Labour party Brendan Corish.
In the 1965 Irish general election, Mac Aonghusa stood on behalf of the Labour party in the Louth constituency, but was not elected. In 1966 Mac Aonghusa published a book of speeches by Corish, the speeches themselves mostly having been ghostwritten by his wife Catherine. The introduction of the book proclaimed that Corish had developed a "brand of democratic republican socialism … broadened by experience and built firmly on Irish‐Ireland roots" and had rid the party of "do‐nothing backwoodsmen", thereby becoming the "first plausible and respected Labour leader in Ireland". It was at this same time that Mac Aonghusa was elevated to vice-chairman of the party. As vice-chair, Mac Aonghusa tried to convince Corish to stand in the 1966 Irish presidential election. When he failed to do so, he supported Fine Gael's Tom O'Higgins (considered to be on the left of that party) in his bid for the presidency. O'Higgins came within 0.5% of beating the incumbent, an ageing Éamon de Valera.
It was around this same time that Mac Aonghusa became active in the Wolfe Tone Society; a republican organisation linked almost directly to Sinn Féin. Mac Aonghusa suggested that republicans with "progressive views" should join the Labour party. In 1966, alongside Máirtín Ó Cadhain and other Gaeilgeoirí, Mac Aonghusa counter-protested and disrupted the Language Freedom Movement, an organisation seeking the abolition of compulsory Irish in the education system. For this, Mac Aonghusa and his allies were criticised as acting illiberally, while Mac Aonghusa maintained that those who opposed the Irish language were "slaves" unworthy of tolerance.
Support of Labour Youth League and expulsion.
Mac Aonghusa's open disdain for the conservative and trade union wings of the Labour, as well as his open embrace of republican sensibilities and tendency to make pronouncements on Labour policy without first consulting the party's structures, brought him many internal enemies. An attempt was made to censure Mac Aonghusa for backing breakaway trade unions, but he was able to survive this. In 1966 Mac Aonghusa encouraged the formation of the Young Labour League, an unofficial youth wing of the party led by Brian Og O'Higgins, son of former Sinn Féin president Brian O'Higgins. Mirroring Mac Aonghusa's own position, the Youth League were Corish loyalists that open rebelled against the views of Labour's conservative deputy leader James Tully. When the youth league began publishing their own weekly newsletter, Labour's administrative council condemned it after discovering material which was "violently" critical of Tully and other Labour conservatives. An ensuing investigation into the newsletter led to Mac Aonghusa admitting that he had financed it and written some of the content, but not the anti-Tully material. After Mac Aonghusa refused to co-operate with further investigations into the matter, he was expelled on 12 January 1967 for "activities injurious" to the party. In the aftermath, Mac Aonghusa portrayed himself a left-wing martyr purged by a right-wing "Star chamber", a tactic that garnered him sympathy. Nevertheless, his expulsion was confirmed at the October 1967 party conference, despite one last appeal. His wife Catherine left the party alongside him.
Return to journalism, writing.
In the aftermath of his expulsion from Labour, Mac Aonghusa expressed an interest in the social democratic wing of Fine Gael, which had been developing under Declan Costello since the mid-1960s. However, he did not join the party and instead ran as an independent candidate in the 1969 general election in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown. When he was not elected there he began to refocus on the revival of the Irish language and with nationalist politics rather than being elected himself.
Upon the onset of the Troubles, Mac Aonghusa was initially supportive of Official Sinn Féin, however by 1972 he came to resent them and, through the Ned Stapleton Cumann, their secret influence over RTÉ. During the Arms Crisis in 1970, Mac Aonghusa supported Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney, who stood accused of arranging to supply weapons to the Provisional IRA, in the pages of the New Statesman and other left‐wing journals. In this time period, Mac Aonghusa warned editors not to reprint his material in the Republic of Ireland as there was a de facto ban on him, and indeed, official attempts were made to block the transmission of his telexed reports.
Despite his earlier famed stark criticism of Fianna Fáil, Mac Aonghusa's defence of Haughey led to a friendship between the two men which resulted in Mac Aonghusa becoming one of his loudest defenders throughout the rest of Haughey's career. Mac Aonghusa's columns in the Sunday Press and Irish language paper "Anois" were accused of descending into self-parody in their stringent defences of Haughey.
During the 1970s, Mac Aonghusa wrote a number of books covering significant figures in Irish republicanism; in order, he released books on James Connolly, Patrick Pearse, Wolfe Tone and Éamon de Valera. In his work on De Valera, Mac Aonghusa emphasised what he perceived as the more radical aspects of the Fianna Fáil founder. During 1974 and 1975, Mac Aonghusa worked as a United Nations Special Representative to the Southern Africa region with Seán MacBride, where they involved themselves in the South African Border War, and during which time Mac Aonghusa became involved in setting up a radio station in Namibia, linked to the SWAPO nationalist party.
In the 1980s, Haughey twice appointed Mac Aonghusa to the Arts Council as well as naming him president of Bord na Gaeilge (1989 to 1993). This was an issue as Mac Aonghusa was already president of Conradh na Gaeilge; being head of the main Irish language lobbying body as well as the state body responsible for the Irish language had an obvious conflict of interest. In 1991, following the announcement by Haughey that the government was to fund the creation of an Irish-language television station (launched in 1996 as Teilifís na Gaeilge), an elated Mac Aonghusa suggested that Haughey would be "remembered among the families of the Gael as long as the Gaelic nation shall survive".
In 1992 there were calls for Mac Aonghusa to step down from Bord na Gaeilge after he pronounced that "every respectable nationalist" in West Belfast should vote for Sinn Féin Gerry Adams over the SDLP candidate Joe Hendron in the 1992 UK general election as Mac Aonghusa considered a defeat for Adams "a victory for British imperialism". Nevertheless, Mac Aonghusa simultaneously advised voters in South Down to vote for the SDLP's Eddie McGrady over Sinn Féin. Mac Aonghusa railed against his detractors at the Conradh na Gaeilge árdfheis that year, declaring that "The mind of the slave, of the slíomadóir, of the hireling and the vagabond is still fairly dominant in Ireland".
As of 1995, Mac Aonghusa continued to label himself a socialist. In the foreword to the book he wrote about James Connolly he released that year, Mac Aonghusa declared that 
However, with the recent collapse of the Soviet Union in mind, Mac Aonghusa declared that the Stalinist regimes of Eastern Europe had not been socialist, and argued that the social democracies of Scandinavia (the Nordic model), were what James Connolly had envisioned as the desired socialist society. In the same text, Mac Aonghusa accused the Irish education system as well as Ireland's media of obfuscating Connolly's views on socialism and nationalism.
Mac Aonghusa battled through ill health in his final years but remained able to continue writing a number of books. His last publication, "Súil Tharam" in 2001, came just two years before his death in 2003.
Personal life.
In 1955 Mac Aonghusa married Catherine Ellis, a member of the Church of Ireland from Belfast; for her married name, Catherine chose to use "McGuinness", the English language equivalent of Mac Aonghusa. Catherine McGuinness would go on to become a Senator and a Judge of the Circuit Court, High Court and Supreme Court over the course of her legal career. They had three children together.

Iten

Iten is a town in Elgeyo-Marakwet County in the Republic of Kenya. It serves as the capital and is the largest town in the county.
The International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) awarded the town a plaque recognising Iten as a World Athletics Heritage Landmark. Because of its Elevation of about 2400 metres above sea level, it attracts many sports Champions due to the benefit of training at high altitude. 
The town is located along the road between Eldoret and Kabarnet at the junction of the road heading to Kapsowar. Elgeyo escarpment and Kerio River are located east of Iten. The growing town had a population of 42,312 at the 2009 consensus.
It forms a common local authority (Iten/Tambach town council) with Tambach, a small town in the vicinity. Iten was the headquarters of the former Elgeyo-Marakwet District since 1966, when it replaced Tambach.
The name of the town is a corruption of "Hill Ten", a local rock formation named by Joseph Thomson in 1883. The hill is located 800 meters outside the village, on the road toward Kessup. It can be best viewed from the Iten Viewpoint.
Naming.
The name is a local corruption of Hill Ten, a local rock formation that was named by Joseph Thompson in 1883.
He inscribed the words Hill Ten on a rock while exploring the Kerio Valley to mark the number of hills he had conquered.
The hill is located about 800 metres outside the main town, on the road toward Kessup.
Running community.
High altitude training center hosts most elite and recreational runners from around the world https://hatc-iten.com/St. Patrick's High School is located in Iten. The school has, over the last 30 years, produced world-class long-distance athletes. Alumni include Ibrahim Hussein, winner of three Boston Marathons and one New York City Marathon; Peter Rono, a 1988 Olympic gold medalist at 1,500 meters; Wilson Boit Kipketer, a 1997 world champion and 2000 Olympic silver medalist in the 3,000-meter steeplechase; Matthew Birir, 1992 Olympic gold medalist at the 3,000-meter steeplechase; and David Rudisha, 2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medalist and world record holder at 800m. The coach of these athletes, Brother Colm O'Connell of Ireland, came to Iten in 1976 expecting to stay just three months. He has lived in Iten ever since.
Many athletes, including Rudisha, and world champions Edna Kiplagat, Florence Kiplagat, Lornah Kiplagat, Linet Masai, and Mary Keitany have made homes in Iten. O'Connell is credited in starting the influx of female athletes to Iten in the early 1990s when he trained and hosted World Champion Sally Barsosio, Rose Cheruiyot, and world junior champion Lydia Cheromei (all of whom lived in O'Connell's back garden houses).
Each Christmas Eve, the town plays host to the largest women's-only race in Kenya, The Shoe4Africa 5km. It was in the 2006 edition of this race that world champion Mary Keitany began her athletics career.
The town hosts the high altitude training centre, HATC, founded in 1999 by Lornah Kiplagat and Pieter Langerhorst. Other landmarks include the Kerio View Hotel founded in 1995 by Jean Paul Fourier. In 2012, the World Record holder in marathon (second fastest at that time) Wilson Kipsang, opened the Keeluu Resort: a lodging, conference and dining center.
The book "More Fire" by Toby Tanser, 2008, was written in and based on Iten, as was Tanser's earlier book "Train Hard, Win easy. The Kenyan Way." 1997. Iten is also a featured location in Adharanand Finn's 2012 book "Running With The Kenyans".

Professor Supermind and Son

"Professor Supermind and Son" was a comic book feature that appeared in issues #60–71 (February 1941 — January 1942) of Dell Comics' "Popular Comics". The strip was drawn by Maurice Kashuba.
Professor Warren (Supermind) uses his energy machine to give his son, Dan, superhuman powers, including super strength, invulnerability, and the ability to fly. With these powers, and his father's other inventions, Dan Warren fought criminals and Nazis. Dan uses his father's televisioscope to find criminals to apprehend. He can communicate telepathically with his father when he's out in the field.
Supermind's son was an obvious Superman knockoff, with a name similar to Superman, the same super powers, and, on some "Popular Comics" covers, a very similar blue and red costume (differing from the green, yellow, and red costume depicted on the pages inside). Despite this, there is no public record of Superman publisher DC Comics having taken legal action against Dell, as they did against some other publishers of characters closely modeled after Superman.
Professor Supermind and Son had the cover spot on "Popular Comics" through issue #66 (Aug 1941); with #67, they were replaced by "The Adventures of Smilin' Jack".
In issue #72, "Professor Supermind" was cancelled and replaced with "The Owl", which began in "Crackajack Funnies".

An Irish Airman Foresees His Death

"An Irish Airman Foresees His Death" is a poem by Irish poet William Butler Yeats (1865–1939), written in 1918 and first published in the Macmillan edition of "The Wild Swans at Coole" in 1919. The poem is a soliloquy given by an aviator in the First World War in which the narrator describes the circumstances surrounding his imminent death. The poem is a work that discusses the role of Irish soldiers fighting for the United Kingdom during a time when they were trying to establish independence for Ireland. Wishing to show restraint from publishing political poems during the height of the war, Yeats withheld publication of the poem until after the conflict had ended.
Poem.
&lt;poem&gt;
I know that I shall meet my fate
Somewhere among the clouds above;
Those that I fight I do not hate
Those that I guard I do not love;
My country is Kiltartan Cross,
My countrymen Kiltartan’s poor,
No likely end could bring them loss
Or leave them happier than before.
Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,
Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,
A lonely impulse of delight
Drove to this tumult in the clouds;
I balanced all, brought all to mind,
The years to come seemed waste of breath,
A waste of breath the years behind
In balance with this life, this death.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Background and interpretation.
The airman in the poem is widely believed to be Major Robert Gregory, a friend of Yeats and the only child of Augusta, Lady Gregory.
Structure.
The poem contains 16 lines of text arranged in iambic tetrameter. The rhyme scheme is arranged in four quatrains of ABAB.
Cultural influence.
Literature.
The title of John Patrick Shanley's play "A Lonely Impulse of Delight" (1985) comes from the poem. Furthermore, quotes from the poem are included in Jawaharlal Nehru's The Discovery of India (1946), Mahmoud Darwish's poem "As He Walks Away" (in "Why Did You Leave the Horse Alone?", 1995), and Pat Barker's "The Silence of the Girls" (2018).
Music.
Musical settings of the poem are performed by various singers and groups, including Angelo Branduardi (on "Branduardi canta Yeats", 1986), Shane MacGowan of The Pogues (on "Now and in Time to Be", 1997) and The Waterboys (on "An Appointment with Mr Yeats", 2011). Additionally, the British rock group Keane based their song "A Bad Dream" (on "Under the Iron Sea", 2006) on the poem.
Film and Television.
The poem is quoted in the movies "Memphis Belle" (1990)"" and "Congo" (1995), as well as in an episode of the second series of "In the Flesh" (2014)"."

Kerry Intermediate Football Championship

The Kerry Intermediate Football Championship is an annual Gaelic football competition contested by mid-tier Kerry GAA clubs.
Austin Stacks are the title holders, having defeated Laune Rangers 1–14 to 0–05 in the 2024 final replay.
History.
The competition was revived in 1959, and District Boards had the right to enter teams. 
Kerry senior players play in the Kerry Intermediate Football Championship. 2014 All-Ireland winner Peter Crowley had a season-ending cruciate injury from playing for Laune Rangers in it in 2019 and missed the 2019 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship as a result. 2021 winners Na Gaeil boasted ex-Australian Football League professional Stefan Okunbor, Diarmuid O'Connor and brothers Jack and Andrew Barry in their ranks.
Honours.
The winners can be promoted to play in the Kerry Club Football Championship in the year after they win this competition.
The winners of the Kerry Intermediate Football Championship progress to the Munster Intermediate Club Football Championship, representing Kerry, later that year, or, as was the case in 2021, the following year. They often do well there and recent winners include Templenoe in 2019 and Na Gaeil winning in 2022 after winning the Kerry Intermediate Football Championship in 2021. Kilcummin made it 12 wins for Kerry out of 13 in 2018. The winners can then go on and win the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Football Championship title like Milltown/Castlemaine did in 2012.
Teams beaten in the first round take part in the Intermediate Football Shield. The winners collect the Fenian Cup.

3. Liga

The 3. Liga is a professional association football league and the third division in Germany. In the German football league system, it is positioned between the 2. Bundesliga and the fourth-tier Regionalliga.
The modern 3. Liga was formed for the 2008–09 season, replacing the Regionalliga, which had previously served as the third-tier in the country. In Germany, the 3. Liga is also the highest division that a club's reserve team can play in.
History.
In January 2006, the discussion was made about a reorganization of the amateur leagues and the establishment of a single-track "3. Bundesliga". The aim of the reform was to create a great performance density for the substructure of the 2. Bundesliga with better support and development opportunities for talented players. In addition, better marketing of the third division should be achieved. A violent dispute broke out in the run-up to the decision scheduled for September 2006 at the DFB-Bundestag about the participation of second teams in the first and second division. After the U23 teams of the professional clubs were initially not supposed to take part in the newly created league for reasons of distortion of competition and low attendance, several Bundesliga clubs demanded, an unrestricted right to participate. Ultimately, a compromise was worked out that initially only allowed four-second substitutes to play in the inaugural season of the third division.
On 8 September 2006, the introduction of the single-track 3. Liga was finally decided at an extraordinary DFB Bundestag. Half of the clubs from the existing Regionalliga North and South were able to qualify for the premiere season, plus four relegated teams from the 2. Bundesliga. The German Football Association, the "DFB", announced the formation of the 3. Liga. It was originally anticipated that the league's name would be 3. Bundesliga, but the "DFB" chose "3. Liga" instead, as the league will be directly administered by the "DFB", not by the German Football League "DFL" (Deutsche Fußball Liga) who runs both Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga. On 10 April 2008, the DFB presented the logo for the new division to the public.
In contrast to the introduction of the 2. Liga in 1974 or the merging of the north and south seasons to form the single-track 2. Bundesliga for the 1981–82 season, there was no multi-year rating when determining the participants for the first season of the new 3. Liga. It was only the performance of the teams in the qualifying period of the Regionalliga relays were athletically qualified for the 3. Liga. In addition, there were four 2. Liga relegated teams in the 2007–08 season. The Regionalliga players who were not qualified for the new division after completing the admission process competed in the new three-pronged fourth division Regionalliga, provided they were granted a license for this.
The first match of the 3. Liga was played on 25 July 2008 between Rot-Weiß Erfurt and Dynamo Dresden at the Steigerwaldstadion in Erfurt. Dynamo Dresden won the match 1–0, with Halil Savran scoring the only goal in the closing stages of the first half. The first goal scorer in the 3. Liga was Halil Savran and the first table leader was SC Paderborn 07. The first champions of the 3. Liga were 1. FC Union Berlin on 9 May 2009, who received the eight-and-a-half-kilogram silver championship trophy.
In the 2018–19 season, four relegated teams were determined for the first time in the history of the 3. Liga, and for the first-time regular Monday games took place. Furthermore, for the first time no U23 team from a higher-class club was able to qualify for the league. With the relegation of the last founding member of the 3. Liga, FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt, in the preseason, for the first time, no team that been part of the league without interruption took part in the game. In addition, at the beginning of the 2018–19 season, the DFB and Adidas signed a partner contract that would run until the end of the 2021–22 season, according to which the company provides a uniform match ball; in all previous seasons each club had its own ball sponsor. The first ball provided by Adidas for all the clubs was the Telstar 18, which was also used at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
For the 2019–20 season, as in the two national leagues, warnings for club officials were introduced in the form of cards. On the 13th match day, the DFB expanded the regulation by an addition – as with players, club officials are threatened with suspension of more than one game and yellow card suspensions after being sent off after being checked by the competent authority. In view of the global COVID-19 pandemic, game operations had to be temporarily suspended after 27 match days on 11 March 2020 and finally completely ceased on 16 March; the measure was initially valid until 30 April 2020. On 3 April, the DFB announced extensive changes to the game rules as a result. Among other things, it was possible to carry out seasonal operations beyond 30 June 2020, so the following season was opened later than the planned time. Ultimately, the final game day took place on 4 July 2020. In addition, a possible application to open insolvency proceedings within the 2019–20 season would no longer have resulted in a point deduction, in the following season only three points would be deducted instead of the usual nine; from the 2021–22 season onwards, the usual regulation should apply again. On 21 May, it was decided to resume game operations on 30 May, and the DFB and DFL had worked out a hygiene concept for all three leagues with the help of the "Task Force Sports Medicine/Special Game Operations". In parallel to the two national leagues, the DFB increased the substitutions quota per team from three to five player for the 3. Liga until the end of the season, and the third-highest German division was not allowed be played in front of spectators.
While small numbers of spectators were allowed from the start of the 2020–21 season under certain conditions, it was decided in an internal league survey to limit the substitution contingent to three players again.
Financial situation.
From its foundation in 2008 to 2013, the league operated at a financial loss, with a record deficit of €20.9 million in 2012–13. The 2013–14 season saw the league make a profit for the first time, of €4.9 million. The league earned €164.5 million, well behind the two Bundesligas above it, but also well ahead of other professional sports leagues in Germany. The Deutsche Eishockey Liga followed with €106.1 million and the Basketball Bundesliga and Handball-Bundesliga were each around the €90 million mark. This makes it the third-most economically successful professional league in all German sports.
Clubs.
Since the establishment of the 3. Liga in 2008, a total of 68 clubs have played in this division. In the 2023–24 season, SSV Ulm were represented in the league for the first time. The last club that had been in the 3. Liga without interruption since it was founded in 2008 is FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt, who were relegated in 2018. The club with the longest uninterrupted spell playing in 3. Liga in the league's history is Hallescher FC (12 seasons between 2012–13 and 2023–24), and the club with the longest ongoing run is TSV 1860 Munich (2018–19 to present). The club with the most seasons in the 3. Liga in total is SV Wehen Wiesbaden (14).

Seasons in 3. Liga.
There are 70 teams that have taken part in 18 3. Liga seasons from the 2008–09 season until the 2025–26 season. The teams in bold compete in the 3. Liga currently. The year in brackets represents the most recent year of participation at this level.
Structure.
Since the first season in 2008–09, 20 teams have been playing in the 2. Bundesliga. The top two teams are promoted directly, the third-placed team has to play for promotion in a two-leg play-off against the team third from the bottom of the 2. Bundesliga. The three (from the 2018–19 season four) last-placed teams will be relegated to the fourth-tier Regionalliga and will be replaced by four (until 2018–19 three) promoted teams from the Regionalligas. The four best teams in the league qualify for the DFB-Pokal.
The teams which are not reserve teams of Bundesliga teams among the 20 teams in the league compete for promotion to the 2. Bundesliga, while the four bottom teams are relegated to one of the five Regionalligen: Regionalliga Nord, Regionalliga Nordost, Regionalliga West, Regionalliga Südwest, and Regionalliga Bayern. Until 2018, three were relegated. If, however, a reserve team is playing in the 3. Liga and the respective first team is relegated to the 3. Liga, the reserve team will be demoted to the fifth-level Oberliga regardless of its league position, because reserve teams of 3. Liga clubs are ineligible to play in the Regionalliga.
Qualifying for the 3. Liga.
At the end of the 2007–08 season, the two best non-reserve teams from each of the two divisions of the Regionalliga were promoted to the 2. Bundesliga. The teams ranked third to tenth in both Regionalliga entered the new 3. Liga, joining the four teams relegated from the 2. Bundesliga to form the new 20-team league. Teams finishing 11th or lower in their Regionalliga remained where they were.
On 18 May 2008, at the end of the 2007–08 2. Bundesliga season, four clubs were relegated from the 2. Bundesliga and became charter members of the 3. Liga: Kickers Offenbach, Erzgebirge Aue, SC Paderborn and FC Carl Zeiss Jena.
On 31 May 2008, at the end of the 2007–08 Regionalliga seasons, clubs placing third through tenth in the Regionalliga Nord and the Regionalliga Süd also qualified for the new 3. Liga.

U23 Regulation.
The teams of the 3. Liga are obliged to list at least 4 players in the match report sheet (game day squad) for each game who are eligible to play for a DFB selection team and who are not older than 23 years for the entire season (1 July to 30 June), i.e. were born on or after 1 July 1998 (U23 players) for the 2021–22 season.
Eligibility to play in the second teams of licensed clubs (Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga) is based on the regulation that applies from the Regionalliga downwards. According to this, only U23 players (see above) may be used, with 3 older players allowed to be in the game at the same time.
List of promoted teams.
The table lists the teams that have been promoted automatically to the 2.Bundesliga and those that have qualified for the promotion playoffs since the league’s inaugural campaign (the 2008-09 season).
Economy.
With an annual turnover of €186 million (as of 2017–18), the 3. Liga was ahead of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga, the Handball-Bundesliga and Basketball Bundesliga (see: List of professional sports leagues by revenue).
License terms.
In addition to sporting qualifications, the clubs concerned must also meet the economic and technical- organizational requirements that are mandatory by the DFB Presidium. As of the 2023-24 season, the minimum required capacity of stadiums has been reduced from 10,001 to 5,001, as a part of the DFB's "3. Liga Economic Task Force". Club managers must also have hold a UEFA Pro License.
In particular, the conditions relating to the arcade infrastructure repeatedly prompt potential climbers from the subordinate regional leagues not to submit any licensing documents; for example SV Rödinghausen or Berliner AK 07, both of which play in stadiums that are clearly too small. On the other hand, cases such as that of KFC Uerdingen 05, 1. FC Saarbrücken or Türkgücü München show that even a temporary game operation in alternative venues is just as problematic as the search for one.
Broadcast rights.
The media rights contract with SportA, the sports rights agency of the German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF, ran until the end of the 2017–18 season. Under this contract, the ARD and its third programs broadcast at least 100, a maximum of 120 games as well as the promotion games to the 3. Liga live. The third programs broadcast further games via live stream on the internet. This reached an average of around four million viewers. in addition, the ARD Sportschau showed summaries of selected games on Saturday from 6 pm to 6:30 pm.
Since the start of the 2017–18 season, Deutsche Telekom has been broadcasting all games for customers and subscribers as internet live streams. From the 2018–19 season to the 2020–21 season, a new contract came into force, with which SportA and Telekom jointly held the media rights to the 3. Liga. The ARD and its state broadcasters will then show 86 games from the 3. Liga as well as the promotion games to the 3. Liga live.
The clubs in the 3. Liga have each received well over a million euros for television rights since the 2018–19 season, around 40 percent more than before. When the 3. Liga was introduced, the clubs received a total of €10 million. Since the 2009–10 season, the annual payout has been €12,8 million. The second teams of the professional clubs do not participate in the television money.
Approximately 1–2 matches per week are broadcast with English commentary on the German Football Association YouTube channel.
Spectators.
The number of spectators in the 3. Liga varies greatly. Big city traditional clubs like Dynamo Dresden, 1. FC Kaiserslautern, 1. FC Magdeburg, FC Hansa Rostock, MSV Duisburg, Arminia Bielefeld, Karlsruher SC, Alemannia Aachen, Eintracht Braunschweig, TSV 1860 Munich and Fortuna Düsseldorf, but also the ambitious newcomer RB Leipzig often had an average attendance of well over 10,000 viewers per game. Dynamo Dresden achieved the highest amount with an average of 27,500 spectators in the 2015–16 season. For the reserve teams, the average attendance is often less than 1,500 spectators per game. Werder Bremen II had the lowest value in the 2011–12 season with an average of 626. In the 2018–19 season, more than 3 million spectators were registered for the first time with an average of over 8,000, and six clubs achieved a five-digit average attendance.
Overall the 3. Liga has attendance numbers that are comparable to the second-tier soccer leagues in Italy (Serie B), France (Ligue 2) and Spain (Segunda División). Only the third-tier English football league One has similarly high or higher attendance numbers.
Economic situation of the clubs.
Since its first season, the 3. Liga has had a higher turnover than the first-class German Leagues in all other sports. For a number of clubs their participation in the 3. Liga ended with major financial problems. In 2009, the Stuttgarter Kickers got down after the DFB had imposed a three-point deduction for a loan that was not repaid on time. In addition, Kickers Emden had to withdraw its application for a license for the 3. Liga for economic reasons. In 2010–11, the opening of insolvency proceeding resulted in the forced regulation of Rot Weiss Ahlen. In the same season, TuS Koblenz waived their right to start the following third division season due to financial bottlenecks. In 2013, after the opening of insolvency proceedings, Alemannia Aachen was determined to be relegated early on and Kickers Offenbach's third division license was revoked. In 2016–17, VfR Aalen and FSV Frankfurt. In March 2018, FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt filed for bankruptcy, followed by Chemnitzer FC in April. Both clubs were relegated after deducting ten or nine points. Several other clubs are constantly threatened with bankruptcy.
At a press conference in mid-October 2019, the DFB published the balance sheet report for the 2018–19 season. A record turnover of €185 million was offset by an average loss of €1.5 million, which meant a new negative record. It was also the ninth of eleven years in which the clubs showed a total deficit, while seven clubs were still able to generate a profit. One of the main drivers of this situation, according to the report, was increased spending on human resources, particularly on player transfers and salaries. The average earnings of a 3. Liga player for 2018–19 was given as around €7,000 per month. In addition, the number of spectators in the stadiums continued to rise, but in return it fell significantly on television.
Financial fair play and the promotion of young talent.
In order to counteract the problem, the DFB decided in September 2018 to introduce so-called financial fair play in the 3. Liga as well as a youth development fund to improve the economic situation of the clubs and strengthen their talent development. A total of around €3.5 million is to be distributed to the clubs. Up to €550,000 is to be distributed equally among clubs with a "positive seasonal result" and clubs that "have achieved or even exceeded their target season goal". A further €2.95 million is to flow into the youth development of the participants, whereby the use of U21 players with German nationality should have a positive effect on the distribution rate per club.
The pots are distributed in September at the end of a season. With the first distribution, Hansa Rostock received the highest amount for the top position in the categories "positive annual result" and "planned quiality" after a record turnover of €19 million in the 2018–19 season.

From the 2012–13 to 2017–18 seasons, the champions of the five Regionalligas and the runners-up of the Regionalliga Südwest entered an end-of-the season play-off to determine the three teams promoted to the 3. Liga. From the 2018–19 season, three out of those five champions take direct promotion, leaving the remaining two to contest the play-off for the fourth promotion.

Texas Longhorns football

The Texas Longhorns football program is the intercollegiate team representing the University of Texas at Austin (variously Texas or UT) in the sport of American football. The Longhorns compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Their home games are played at Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin, Texas.
With over 900 wins, and an all-time win–loss percentage of .704, the Longhorns rank 4th (tied) and 12th on the all-time wins and win–loss records lists, respectively. Additionally, the program claims 4 national championships, 33 conference championships, 100 First Team All-Americans (62 consensus and 25 unanimous), and 2 Heisman Trophy winners.
History.
Beginning in 1893, the Texas Longhorns football program is one of the most highly regarded and historic programs of all time. From 1936 to 1946 the team was led by Hall of Fame coach Dana X. Bible, and then from 1957 to 1976 the team was led by Hall of Fame coach Darrell K Royal, who won three national championships. The first championship was in 1963 and the second was in 1969. In 2009, ESPN ranked Texas as the seventh-most prestigious college football program since 1936. In 2012, the football program was valued at $805 million, more than the calculated value of several NFL teams. Texas is known for their post-season appearances, ranking second in number of bowl game appearances (55), fourth in bowl game victories (29), most Southwest Conference football championships (27), and most Cotton Bowl Classic appearances and victories. Other NCAA records include 108 winning seasons out of 122 total seasons, 24 seasons with 10 or more wins, 9 undefeated seasons, and 26 seasons with at most one loss or tie. From 1936 to 2012, the Longhorns football teams have been in the AP or coaches' rankings 66 out of 76 seasons (86.8% of the time), finishing those seasons ranked in the top twenty-five 48 times and the top ten 28 times. Texas claims four Division I-A national championships (1963, 1969, 1970 and 2005) and 33 conference championships (4 Big 12 Conference, 27 Southwest Conference, and 2 Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association).
A total of 129 (53 consensus and 22 unanimous) Texas players have been named to College Football All-America Teams, while two Longhorn players, Earl Campbell (1977) and Ricky Williams (1998), have won the Heisman Trophy, "College football's most prestigious individual honor". Seventeen Longhorns have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, while four are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
At the start of the 2019 season, Texas' all-time record was 909–371–33 (.705), which ranked as the third-most wins. By the end of the season, Texas' record was 916–375–33 (.704), losing a spot and dropping to fourth in NCAA Division I FBS overall history.
In July 2021, after 25 seasons as members of the Big 12, Texas and rival Oklahoma accepted invitations to join the Southeastern Conference (SEC) no later than the 2025 season. In February 2023, the Big 12 announced that the two schools had negotiated a combined $100 million early termination fee in order to leave for the SEC a year before the schools' media rights deal with the Big 12 was set to expire. The Longhorns football team continued competing in the Big 12 through the 2023 season before moving to the SEC in 2024.
Conference affiliations.
Texas has been affiliated with four conferences and twice been an independent.
Championships.
National championships.
Texas has been selected national champion in 9 seasons from NCAA-designated major selectors, including 4 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll. The 1963, 1969, 1970, and 2005 championships are claimed by the school, while the remainder are not claimed.
Conference championships.
Texas has won 34 conference championships, 27 outright and six shared, spanning three conferences, the Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the Southwest Conference, and the Big 12 Conference.
† Co-champions
Division championships.
Texas has won a share of 7 Big 12 South titles, 5 of which resulted in an appearance in the Big 12 Championship Game. Texas is 3–2 in those appearances. As of 2011, the new ten-team Big 12 Conference ceased to have divisions and conference championship games.
† Co-champions
Bowl games.
At the end of the 2018 season, Texas is tied for second in all time bowl appearances in the NCAA FBS at 55, matching Georgia and trailing Alabama's 70 appearances. (Note: Some years Texas went to two bowls although they were in different seasons)
^ The 2006 Rose Bowl was both the Rose Bowl Game and the sanctioned BCS National Championship Game, after that season the BCS NCG became a separate game unaffiliated with the major bowl games.
† The Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston was discontinued in 1988, but was replaced by the Houston Bowl (2000–2001) and the Texas Bowl (2006–current).
‡ The Freedom Bowl merged with the Holiday Bowl in 1995.
Texas has played in four Bowl Championship Series games (including two BCS National Championships) and one New Year's Six bowl. Texas also played in two Bowl Alliance games (the precursor to the BCS): the 1995 Sugar Bowl and the 1997 Fiesta Bowl.
Head coaches.
There have been 31 head coaches since the inaugural team in 1893, with Steve Sarkisian being the current head coach of the Longhorns.
Home stadium.
The Longhorns have played their home games in Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium (formerly just "Memorial Stadium" and "Texas Memorial Stadium") on Campbell-Williams Field since 1924. The stadium is located on the campus of The University of Texas in Austin, Texas. The current official stadium capacity is 100,119, making it the second largest football venue in the state of Texas, the fifth largest in the SEC Conference, the fifth largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA, and the seventh largest non-racing stadium in the world.
The stadium has been expanded several times since its original opening, and now includes 100,119 permanent seats, the nation's first high definition video display in a collegiate facility nicknamed "Godzillatron," and a newly renovated Joe Jamail Field with FieldTurf. The current DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium and Big 12 attendance record was set on September 15, 2018, against USC with 103,507 spectators.
The final planned phase of the stadium's expansion includes the construction of permanent seating and an upper deck in the south end zone, completely enclosing the playing field. The stadium's seating capacity is expected to reach 112,000 once the south end zone is fully enclosed, which would mean DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium would surpass Michigan Stadium as the largest football stadium in North America. However, the date of the final construction phase to fully enclose the south end zone has not been set nor have any funds been raised. Varying sources claim this phase may not take place for upwards of 10 to 15 years, though on March 11, 2014, an announcement was made that an exploratory committee has been formed regarding the expansion of the stadium in conjunction with the construction of the Dell Medical School on campus.
Before the Longhorns football team moved to DKR, they played their home games at Clark Field from 1887 to 1924. Clark Field was a wooden-structured stadium located on the University of Texas campus. The Longhorns last game at Clark Field before moving to brand new Memorial Stadium occurred on October 25, 1924. The Longhorns battled the Florida Gators to a 7–7 tie that day. Texas finished with a record of 135–23–3 during their time at Clark Field.
Rivalries.
Oklahoma.
Texas has a long-standing rivalry with the University of Oklahoma. The football game between the University of Texas and Oklahoma is commonly known as the "Red River Rivalry" and is held annually in Dallas at the Cotton Bowl. Dallas is used as a "neutral site" since it is approximately midway between the two campuses. The stadium is split, with each team having an equal number of supporters on each side of the 50 yard line. Texas state flags fly around the Longhorn end of the stadium and Oklahoma state flags fly around the Sooner end. This border rivalry is often considered to be one of the top five current rivalries in the NCAA. The Red River Shootout originated in 1900, while Oklahoma was still a territory of the United States, and it is the longest-running college-football rivalry played on a neutral field. Since 2005, the football game has received sponsorship dollars in return for being referred to as the "SBC Red River Rivalry" (changed to AT&amp;T Red River Rivalry in 2006 after SBC merged with AT&amp;T), a move which has been criticized both for its commercialism and its political correctness. The University of Texas holds its annual Torchlight Parade during the week of the Red River Rivalry. In 2005, the "Dallas Morning News" did an opinion poll of the 119 Division 1A football coaches as to the nations top rivalry game in college football. The Texas-OU game was ranked third. The game typically has conference or even national significance. Since 1945, one or both of the two teams has been ranked among the top 25 teams in the nation coming into 60 out of 65 games. Twice Texas has defeated the Sooners a record eight straight times from 1940 to 1947 and 1958–1965. One of the most significant meetings was in 1963 with Oklahoma ranked No. 1 and Texas ranked No. 2, the game won by Texas 28–7 en route to their first officially recognized national championship. The series has also had its share of games that came down to the wire and comebacks most recently in 2021 which saw sixth-ranked Sooners rallying from a 21-point first-quarter deficit to edge the 21st-ranked Longhorns 55–48 in the highest-scoring game in the rivalry. The game has also been the result of controversy. The meeting in 1976 was a heated affair as the Oklahoma staff was accused of spying on Texas' practices, a move later confirmed by former OU head coach Barry Switzer. In the 2008 season Texas scored 45 points over then No. 1 Oklahoma for the win, but even with the victory Texas would not go on to the Big 12 Championship game due to BCS rankings. Six of the last ten showings featured one of the participants in the BCS National Championship Game (2000, 2003–2005, 2008, 2009), including national titles won by Oklahoma in 2000 and by Texas in 2005. On October 6, 2018, the Longhorns and Sooners squared off in a Red River Rivalry game that will go down in history. After giving up a 21-point 4th Quarter lead, the Longhorns found themselves tied at 45 with the Sooners with just over two minutes left to play in the game. As the Longhorns began to systematically march down the field, time began to run out. However, a Cameron Dicker 40-yard field goal sealed a 48–45 win for the Longhorns and finally ended the 2-year drought in the Red River Rivalry.
In 2022, Texas shut out Oklahoma, beating them 49-0. This was the most dominant win by either side since 2003, and the first shut out since 2004.
Texas leads the all-time series 63–51–5 through the 2023 season. In 2023 Oklahoma surpassed Texas A&amp;M as UT’s most played football rivalry game.
Texas Tech.
The first meeting between the Texas Longhorns and Texas Tech Matadors (as the team was known until 1937) was in 1928, a 12–0 win for Texas. The teams only faced each other nine times before 1960 with Texas holding an 8–1 record over Tech at the time. From 1960 to 1995, both schools played annually as members of the Southwest Conference. Since 1996, both schools have played as members of the Big 12 Conference. In 1996, the Texas Tech University System was established and the system's first chancellor, John T. Montford, a former member of the Texas State Senate, started the exchange of a traveling trophy between the two universities called the Chancellor's Spurs. The spurs are gold and silver and engraved with Texas Tech's Double T and Texas' interlocking UT logo and were first awarded to Texas after a 38–32 victory over the Red Raiders in Lubbock.
Texas leads the all-time series 54–18 through the 2023 season.
Arkansas.
Old Southwest Conference rivals, Texas and Arkansas first met in 1894, a 54–0 win by Texas. In the days of the Southwest Conference, the game between the two schools usually decided which team would win the conference championship. Overall, Texas won the game about 71% of the time, which led to an incredibly fierce and intense rivalry. The two programs have met 79 times and have had many big games. The meeting in 1969 is the true Game of the Century commemorating the 100th year of college football, which led to the Longhorns' 1969 national championship. This game, which is commonly known as "Dixie's Last Stand" and The Big Shootout, still does not sit well with Razorback fans to this day. The game saw Arkansas lead throughout only to have Texas come from behind and win in the final minutes, 15–14. The game also saw former President Richard Nixon attend the game and crown the Longhorns the National Champion in the locker room. The Texas-Arkansas game has not been played annually since Arkansas's departure from the Southwest Conference to the Southeastern Conference in 1991. However, many Longhorn and Razorback fans still consider this matchup an important rivalry. Texas and Arkansas played in September 2008, with Texas winning, 52–10. Texas and Arkansas also played in the 2014 Texas Bowl, which Arkansas won, 31–7. Texas and Arkansas played in the 2021 regular season, with Arkansas winning by a score of 40-21.
Texas leads the series 57–23 through the 2024 season.
Texas A&amp;M.
The first meeting between the football squads of the University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M was in 1894, a 38–0 win for Texas. In fact, Texas won its first seven games against the Aggies, all of them by shutout. By 1915 Texas held a 15–4–2 advantage against the Aggies. The game was a back and forth affair for the next twenty years as the home team usually took the victory in the game, however Texas still maintained the series lead. In 1940, Texas shutout the Aggies 7–0 and kept them from receiving the Rose Bowl bid that year. From that year forward Texas would go on to win 33 of the next 38 games over A&amp;M. It was not until the mid-1980s that A&amp;M developed a win streak over Texas and in the late 1990s and 2000s the rivalry would again go back to Longhorns. The Texas/Texas A&amp;M rivalry has given rise to several stereotypes on both sides: Texas A&amp;M is generally portrayed as the rural smaller school while Texas is portrayed as the urban-wealthy larger school. With the exception of the 1994 game, when A&amp;M's probation restricted the Aggies from being televised, the annual football game with Texas A&amp;M traditionally takes place on Thanksgiving Day or the day after each year. This iconic in-state rivalry is often considered one of the top college rivalries of all time. In July 2011, Texas A&amp;M elected to join the Southeastern Conference beginning in 2012, which ended of the 118-year consecutive meetings between the two schools. On November 24, 2011, Texas faced Texas A&amp;M in College Station in the final scheduled meeting of the rivalry as of January 2019. Texas defeated Texas A&amp;M 27–25 on a last second field goal to win the final meeting. In an attempt to generate more attention for the rivalry in sports other than football, the two schools created the Lone Star Showdown in 2004. Essentially, each time the two schools meet in a sport, the winner of the matchup gets a point. At the end of the year, the school with the most points wins the series and receives the Lone Star Trophy.
Texas leads the series 76–37–5 through the 2023 season. The rivalry will resume when Texas moves to the Southeastern Conference in 2024.
Baylor.
Baylor and Texas have played each other 111 times, with the first game between Baylor and Texas being played in 1901. Only Oklahoma and Texas A&amp;M have played Texas more times than Baylor. Both Baylor and Texas were founding members of the Southwest Conference and the BIG 12 Conference. Texas leads the series with Baylor 81-28-4. However, starting in 2010 this rivalry intensified as Baylor established themselves as a major contender in the BIG 12 Conference with Baylor playing for 4 BIG 12 titles and winning 3, including a head-to-head win over Texas to clinch the BIG 12 Championship in 2013, in what is now known as the "Ice Bowl". Losing the BIG 12 Title to Baylor 30-10 was Mack Brown's last regular season game as the head coach at Texas.
Since 2015, Texas holds a 7-2 edge in the series with Baylor.
TCU.
Texas leads the series with TCU 64–28–1 through the 2023 season.
Rice.
Texas leads the series 75–21–1 through the 2023 season. The teams were conference rivals for 81 seasons in the Southwest Conference from 1915 through 1995.

Uniforms.
Colors.
The 1893 team did not always wear orange. They also wore gold and white uniforms. In 1895, the Texas Athletic Association moved to orange and white colors. In 1897, the Association moved to orange and maroon to save cleaning costs. The Cactus Yearbook at the time listed the university colors as either gold or orange and white until the 1899 Cactus declared the university colors to be gold and maroon. Students at the university's medical branch in Galveston (UTMB) were in favor of royal blue. By 1899, a UT fan could have worn any of yellow, orange, white, red, maroon, or even blue.
The Board of Regents held an election in that year to decide the team colors. Students, faculty, staff and alumni were asked to vote. 1,111 votes were cast, with 562 in favor of orange and white. Orange and maroon received 310, royal blue 203, crimson 10, and royal blue and crimson 11. For the next 30 years, Longhorn teams wore bright orange on their uniforms, which faded to yellow by the end of the season. By the 1920s, other teams sometimes called the Longhorn squads "yellow bellies," a term that didn't sit well with the athletic department. In 1928, UT football coach Clyde Littlefield ordered uniforms in a darker shade of orange that wouldn't fade, which would later become known as "burnt orange" or "Texas orange." The dark-orange color was used until the dye became too expensive during the Great Depression, and the uniforms reverted to the bright orange for another two decades, until coach Darrell K Royal revived the burnt-orange color in the early 1960s.
For the 2009 Lone Star Showdown, the Longhorns wore a Nike Pro Combat uniform.
Helmets.
From 1961 to 1962, the Longhorns' helmets featured the individual player's number on the side in burnt orange above the "Bevo" logo, which was also in burnt orange, with a large burnt-orange stripe down the middle of the helmet. The burnt-orange stripe was removed in 1963 and the helmet featured only the burnt-orange Bevo logo below the player's number, which was also in burnt orange. In 1967, the team abandoned the individual player's number above the logo, and moved the burnt-orange Bevo logo to the center of the helmet's side. With the exception of the 1969 season, this remained the team's helmet design until 1977. In 1969, the helmet design commemorated the 100th anniversary of the first college football game. The player's number was replaced by a large burnt-orange football above the Bevo logo. Inside the football was a white number "100" that indicated the anniversary year.
Traditions.
The University of Texas is a tradition-rich school, and many of those traditions are associated with athletics events, especially football. Some Longhorn traditions include:
Future opponents.
SEC Conference opponents.
The Texas football program joined the SEC in 2024. The conference expanded to 16 teams. Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.
Non-conference opponents.
Announced schedules as of May 13, 2025. As part of the agreement allowing Texas and Oklahoma to move from the Big 12 to the SEC in 2024, instead of 2025, the sites of the home-and-home series with Michigan, originally scheduled to be at Texas in 2024, and at Michigan in 2027, were reversed, giving Fox the right to broadcast the 2024 game at Michigan.
Recruiting Department.
Texas Football's recruiting department is led by Billy Glasscock. Glasscock came from NC State in 2021 as director of player personnel, leading a team of staffers and interns in a combination of duties between recruiting and player personnel. On the recruiting side, Taylor Searels directs everything from an events standpoint to accommodate recruiting visits. In player personnel, JM Jones and Austin Shelton are assistant directors of player personnel, handling offense and defense respectively. They manage a team of recruiting assistants that all manage a position and report to their position coach. This recruiting assistant program has been a robust program that has seen the likes of Daniel Bernstein - EDGE, Julian Rowe-Cohen - TEs, Maxwell Solman - OL, Jacob De Santos - DB, Jake Warren - WR, and Tanner Martin - QBs come through. Their jobs were to identify recruits, evaluate them, and bring them to their position coaches if they are deemed worth watching and offering. These are the individuals that found most of the players on the team before anyone else.

Jigawa ethanol programme

The Jigawa ethanol program is a program to produce ethanol from agricultural products in Jigawa, Nigeria. The ethanol programme was initiated by the Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo, to process sugarcane into biofuel. Besides sugarcane, the Nigerian Government plans to start processing cassava as well.
Objective of the program.
The ethanol programme initiated by President Olusegun Obasanjo would be gradually introduced into the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) or petrol to a maximum of 10 per cent as being practised in countries like the United States, Brazil and Thailand. The programme was introduced to diversify the depleting source of energy and reduce the environmental pressure and the adverse effect of fossil fuels like oil, coal and gas in the country. It would also serve as alternate source of energy.

Logos Bible Software

Logos Bible Software is a digital library application developed by Faithlife Corporation. It is designed for electronic Bible study. In addition to basic eBook functionality, it includes extensive resource linking, note-taking functionality and linguistic analysis for study of the Bible - both in translation and in its original languages.
History.
Windows and Macintosh versions.
Logos Bible Software was launched in 1992 by two Microsoft employees, Bob Pritchett and Kiernon Reiniger, along with Bob's father, Dale Pritchett. The three quit their jobs to develop Christian software. After acquiring data from the CDWordLibrary project at Dallas Theological Seminary (an earlier Bible software package for use on Windows 2), Logos released an updated version called the Logos Library System platform in 1995.
Mobile versions.
An iPhone app was released alongside Logos 4 in November 2009.
An Android app was released in 2012. The initial release allowed little more than the reading of Logos books, so version 2.0 followed quickly in August 2012, which added notes, highlighting, reading plans, Bible Word Study, the Passage Guide and a split-screen view. This brought much closer parity with the iOS app.
Rebranded versions.
Faithlife Corporation has also produced rebranded versions of "Logos Bible Software" with almost identical functionality. "Verbum Catholic Software" is aimed at Roman Catholics (and adds databases of Catholic topics and Saints, and more data from the Deuterocanonical Books). From 2014 to 2020, Faithlife produced "Noet", which focused on scholarly work in the humanities, particularly the classics and philosophy.
Reception.
It has been noted for being user-friendly, having the largest number of resources for software of its type, and offering unique tools and datasets not found in other products. It has also received some criticism for its high cost and lack of speed when compared with other Bible software packages.

Jed Water

The Jed Water is a river and a tributary of the River Teviot in the Borders region of Scotland.
In total the Jed Water is over long and it falls . It flows into the Teviot near Jedfoot Bridge () two miles north of Jedburgh. Jed Water rises from a source on Carlin Tooth in the Cheviot Hills where it is first known as Raven Burn.
Description.
The river in past times was the main source of water for the monks living in Jedburgh Abbey. It also powered a watermill in the town of Jedburgh although this no longer exists. It gives its name to Jedburgh and Jedforest. In the 1800s it had trout in the river. The Ordnance gazetteer said Jed Water "in the parts immediately above the town of Jedburgh ... more of the elements of fine landscape than during a whole day's ride in the most favourite Scottish haunts of tourists." The guide drew attention to the pure waters, the brisk currents, the steep landscapes and the contrasts which it thought picturesque.
The name Jed is of obscure origin. James has suggested that it may derive from Proto-Indo-European "*wei(h1)- d-" "a bend, something curved or twisted". He also notes that Scots "Gedde-" in Jedburgh may have been adopted from Cumbric " gwï:δ" "a wood", and that the river name may be a back-formation.
In 1787 James Hutton created modern geology when he discovered Hutton's Unconformity at Inchbonny, Jedburgh, in layers of sedimentary rock on the banks of the Jed Water. He later wrote of how he "rejoiced at my good fortune in stumbling upon an object so interesting in the natural history of the earth, and which I had been long looking for in vain".
Flooding.
Jed Water is liable to flood, so the river levels are monitored near the old Canongate Bridge. The depth is usually between and metres deep but it has been as deep as which it reached in January 2016. In 2020 there was a problem when the flood defences in Jedburgh were breached by debris in one storm just before another storm hit. Luckily repairs were made and serious flooding was avoided.

Shurman

Shurman is an American rock band from Austin, Texas, founded by Aaron Beavers and Damon Allen.
Band history.
It can be argued that Shurman unofficially started as a high school garage band in 1990 with Aaron Beavers and Damon Allen. The two met when Beavers' family moved from Texas to Allen's hometown outside of Atlanta. The band idea was put on the back burner for almost 10 years while Aaron headed to College and then Hawaii, and Allen moved to New York City to pursue acting after high school. Remaining friends, Beavers and Allen kept contact and Aaron sent Damon demos of close to 100 songs he had written (&amp; recorded on an old 4 track) while in Hawaii. Soon after Aaron moved to Los Angeles, California, he called Damon and told him to buy a drum kit because he needed a drummer, and Shurman was formed. Two EPs were released 2001's Songs to Tell Your Friends About and 2002's Superfecta. They toured the U.S. relentlessly playing some 200 shows a year. Bassist Keith Hanna, a Clevelander formerly from the band Rosavelt, joined them in 2004. Their first full length Vanguard Records release titled "Jubilee" released in 2005. In 2006 the band returned with a live CD called "A Week in the Life".
After deciding the traditional record label route was not the best idea for the band they left Vanguard Records and recorded "Waiting for the Sunset" independently with producer Danny White at famed 16 Ton Studios in Nashville. Not long after finishing the CD, drummer Damon Allen left the band. In 2008, Shurman performed 50 shows in the UK/Europe and completed an extensive North American tour supporting the release of "Waiting for the Sunset". In November 2008, Shurman announced on their Myspace page that they were relocating to Austin from L.A. As part of the move, drummer Jerry Angel left the band to remain in California. The band moved to Austin in January 2009 and worked briefly with drummer Craig Bagby. Los Angeles drummer Nick Amoroso, who played four dates with the band in November 2008, became Shurman's full-time drummer in May 2009. He toured with the band from May 2009 to March 2010, and recorded 2 songs for the album, "Still Waiting for the Sunset," which was released on January 26, 2010. In early 2009, the band signed a deal with Sustain Records/Universal. Recent Austin performances have included such artists as John Popper (of Blues Traveler) as well as Josh Zee and Teal Collins (from The Mother Truckers). The band also toured frequently with Blues Traveler and Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers.
In 2012, the band teamed up with European record labels Blue Rose &amp; Rootsy (in Scandinavia) for their release "Inspiration" and hired drummer Clint Short. The band found themselves climbing the charts in Europe and subsequently found themselves headlining tours through Europe with great success. In early 2014, the band entered famed Cedar Creek Studios in South Austin to prepare for a new recording to be released mid-2014.
2025 UPDATE: Shurman has reunited with original members, Aaron Beavers, Damon Allen, and Rich Mahan, along with Bassist Mike Therieau. The band is booked to tour Sweden in August and play summer festivals in Stockholm and Falkenburg in celebration of the 20th anniversary of their debut major label release, Jubilee.

Of Long Duration Anguish

Of Long Duration Anguish is the second album by Estonian death metal band Aggressor. This was the last album the band did under the name Aggressor before being renamed to "No-Big-Silence" in 1996.
In 1993 their second album "Of Long Duration Anguish" was released as MC and in 1994 as CD. Korrozia Metalla cover "Russian Vodka" on that album was sung by bassist Cram which resulted in the idea of changing their style. In 1995 Aggressor performed at the biggest rock-festival in Estonia, "Rock Summer '95". After that they went into studio (still as Aggressor) where they were suggested a name-change. So in 1996 they wrote lyrics to a song titled "No-Big-Silence 99" (a street in the U.S. where a massmurder was committed). So the album was titled "99" and the band was renamed to "No-Big-Silence".

John Ferguson (police officer)

Major Sir John Frederick Ferguson (23 August 1891 – 27 May 1975) was a senior British police officer.
Ferguson was the son of a major in the Indian Army. He was educated at the University of Aberdeen. He passed out from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, was commissioned into the Durham Light Infantry on 14 February 1912, and was immediately posted to the North-West Frontier of India. During the First World War he remained in India until 1916, when he received a temporary Captaincy and spent the rest of the war in Mesopotamia and Palestine.
He served as regimental adjutant until 1917 and again from 1919 to 1922. He attended Staff College in 1925. He served as a GSO3 (Staff Officer) with the Shanghai Defence Force from 24 January 1927 to 17 December 1927. He was brigade major of the 14th Infantry Brigade from 10 March 1928 to 15 April 1931. During this period he received a Brevet promotion to Major in 1930, and received the regimental rank in 1931. He attended the Royal Naval College in 1932.
Ferguson retired from the Army in 1933 and joined the Metropolitan Police, being appointed Chief Constable in the Commissioner's Office on 1 November 1933. On 1 September 1935 he was promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner and took command of No.4 District (South London). From 1 September 1938 to 1939 he was Commandant of the Metropolitan Police College. He rejoined the Army in 1940 after the outbreak of World War II as a GSO1 at the War Office, but soon returned to the Metropolitan Police in September 1940, as he had reached the maximum age for reserve officers.
On 1 April 1943 he was appointed first Chief Constable of the new Sussex Joint Police, the short-lived result of an amalgamation between the forces of East Sussex, West Sussex, Brighton, Eastbourne, Hastings and Hove.
On 1 November 1945 he returned to the Metropolitan Police as Assistant Commissioner "A", in charge of administration and uniformed policing. He stayed for less than a year before being appointed Chief Constable of Kent in July 1946. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1948 Queen's Birthday Honours and was knighted in the 1953 Coronation Honours. On 1 July 1955 he was appointed Officer of the Order of St John. He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal (QPM) in the 1957 New Year Honours.

Dorothy Tyler-Odam

Dorothy Jennifer Beatrice Tyler, MBE (née Odam; 14 March 1920 – 25 September 2014) was a British athlete who competed mainly in the high jump.
Biography.
She was born in Stockwell, London. Odam competed for Great Britain in the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin, Germany, where she won the silver medal behind Ibolya Csák. She jumped the highest and was the first to clear 1.60 meters, and would have won under modern countback rules, but under the 1936 rulebook a jump-off was called for, and Csák won the gold.
Shortly before the 1936 Olympic Games, Odam won her first British WAAA Championships title, becoming the national high jump champion at the 1936 WAAA Championships. She would go on to win another seven national high jump titles, spanning from 1936 until 1956.
In 1939 she broke the world record in the high jump with 1.66m, but Germany's Dora Ratjen allegedly broke her record quickly. Odam was suspicious of Ratjen and, according to Odam, "They wrote to me telling me I didn't hold the record, so I wrote to them saying, 'She's not a woman, she's a man'. They did some research and found 'her' serving as a waiter called Hermann Ratjen. So I got my world record back." Odam's world record was formally recognized by the sport's world governing body, the IAAF, in 1957.
She won the silver medal again representing Great Britain in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, making her the only woman to win Olympic athletics medals before and after the war. Her 1936 win also made her the first British woman to win an individual Olympic medal in athletics.
Odam was also twice a gold medallist at the British Empire Games, winning at Sydney in 1938 and Auckland in 1950. In Sydney she was the only Englishwoman to win athletics gold, setting a Games record of 5 ft 3 in, which is the same as 1.60 meters.
She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2002 New Year Honours for services to athletics.
In 2012, she was the official starter for the London Marathon.
She died on 25 September 2014 aged 94 following a long illness.

Francophone Association of Municipalities of Ontario

The Francophone Association of Municipalities of Ontario (or AFMO, from its French name, Association française des municipalités d'Ontario) is a Canadian political organization of municipalities in the province of Ontario which have significant Franco-Ontarian communities. The organization oversees the maintenance and development of municipal government services in French, and works with other levels of government, as well as organizations in other Canadian provinces, on issues unique to francophone and bilingual communities.
The organization was founded in 1989, after a group of francophone mayors and councillors attending the annual conference of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario met to discuss the need for collaboration on the special issues unique to francophone and bilingual communities. Founding members included Vanier mayor Gisèle Lalonde, Russell mayor Gaston Patenaude, Rockland mayor Jean-Marc Lalonde, Hawkesbury mayor Yves Drouin, and Rayside-Balfour mayor Lionel Lalonde.
In addition to the organization's 40 member municipalities, a number of other non-municipal organizations and individuals have associate member status, including one municipal government in Quebec. Associate membership is most commonly held by organizations such as school boards in bilingual areas, provincial government agencies or non-governmental organizations that serve the francophone community; in the case of some provincial government ministries, however, it is held on an individual basis by a senior civil servant who is directly responsible for the ministry's French language programs, rather than by the ministry as a whole.
Member municipalities.
The district social services boards of Algoma, Cochrane, Timiskaming and Sudbury-Manitoulin also have municipal member status.
The municipal government of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec is also a member of the organization, but has associate member status since it is outside of Ontario.

Capas National Shrine

The Capas National Shrine () in Barangay Aranguren, Capas, Tarlac, Philippines was built by the Philippine government as a memorial to Allied soldiers who were interned at Camp O'Donnell at the end of the Bataan Death March during the Second World War.
The site, which was the former concentration camp for the Allied prisoners, is a focus for commemorations on Araw ng Kagitingan (Valour Day), an annual observance held on 9 April—the anniversary of the surrender of US and Philippine forces to Imperial Japan in 1942. There is also a memorial inside the site to the Czechs who died fighting alongside the Filipino and US soldiers.
Description.
The area where the Bataan Death March ended was proclaimed as "Capas National Shrine" by President Corazon Aquino on 7 December 1991. The shrine encompasses of parkland, of which have been planted with trees each representing the dead, at the location of the former concentration camp. Prior to the construction, the location was under the control of the United States Navy as U.S. Naval Radio Station, Tarlac until 1989.
On 9 April 2003, a obelisk symbolizing peace surrounded by a new memorial wall were unveiled on a part of the grounds of the former internment camp. The obelisk is surrounded by a three-segmented, black marble wall engraved with the names of more than 30,000 Filipinos who were incarcerated in the camp. There are also statistics about the total number of prisoners and dead, accompanied by poems for peace.
Nearby, on the western side of the shrine, there are three smaller memorials to the countries whose nationals died at the camp: the Philippines, the United States, and the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia). A small museum and monument is also on the site, built by an American group called the "Battling Bastards of Bataan". Included here is a roster of Filipino officers who were appointed by the Camp Commandant to manage the POWs. It also memorializes the daily sufferings of the POWs under the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army camp wards. Records have indicated that around 400 Filipino POWs died daily until August 1942.
A few hundred meters from the Obelisk is a garden separated from the rest of the shrine by a creek that can be crossed via a hanging bridge. The relics of an old livestock wagon or boxcar of the Philippine National Railway and railings are also found in the shrine complex. This display would be similar to the SNCF wagon displayed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, giving visitors an idea of the difficulties faced by the POWs who were herded in 80 persons per wagon volume, during hot summer conditions, without food, water, or facilities for sanitation.
According to the Philippine government's master plan, the Shrine will be a part of the New Clark City.

Rosemary Radford Ruether

Rosemary Radford Ruether (; 2 November 1936 – 21 May 2022) was an American Catholic feminist theologian known for her significant contributions to the fields of feminist theology and ecofeminist theology. Her teaching and her writings helped establish these areas of theology as distinct fields of study; she is recognized as one of the first scholars to bring women's perspectives on Christian theology into mainstream academic discourse. 
Ruether was active in the civil rights movement in the 1960s, and her own work was influenced by liberation and black theology. She taught at Howard University for ten years, and later at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary. Over the course of her career, she wrote on a wide range of topics, including antisemitism, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the intersection of feminism and Christianity, and the climate crisis. 
Ruether was an advocate of women's ordination, a movement among Catholics who affirm women's capacity to serve as priests, despite official church prohibition. For decades, Ruether served as a board member and then a member "emerita" for the abortion rights group Catholics for Choice. Her public stance on these topics was criticized by some leaders in the Catholic Church.
Biography.
Early life and education.
Ruether was born Rosemary Radford on November 2, 1936, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. She was the youngest of three daughters born to her parents, Rebecca Cresap Radford (née Ord) and Robert Radford. Her father, an Episcopalian, worked as a civil engineer. Her mother, a Catholic, worked as a secretary. 
Ruether's father died when she was twelve years old, after which Ruether and her mother moved to San Diego, California. Ruether attended several Catholic schools staffed by the Sisters of Providence from St. Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana, who, in conjunction with her mother's friend group, offered Ruether a strong feminist and activist foundation that informed her later work. She pursued an undergraduate education at Scripps College from 1954 to 1958. 
Ruether held a BA in philosophy and religion from Scripps College (1958), as well as an MA in ancient history (1960) and a PhD in classics and patristics (1965) from Claremont Graduate School in Claremont, California. Given her academic focus in the area of patristics, she wrote her dissertation on Gregory of Nazianzus.
Career.
Ruether's political and theological commitments sometimes created conflict between her and the institutions for which she worked. She lost her first teaching job (1964–1965) and her only position in a Catholic educational institution—Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles, California—due to her pro-birth control and pro-choice positions. After losing this position, she spent the summer of 1965 in Mississippi as a civil rights worker before accepting a position at Howard University, an HBCU. 
Ruether was appointed as a professor at Howard University in Washington, DC, from 1965 to 1976. During her time at Howard, she chaired the religion department. Despite her radical feminist theology, Ruether remained in the Catholic Church alongside other religious activists. Her first book, "The Church Against Itself" (1967), criticizes the doctrine of the church and the church's views of sexuality and reproduction.
Ruether participated in civil rights activism during the 1960s in Mississippi and Washington, DC. She worked for the Delta Ministry in Mississippi where she was exposed to the struggles of African American communities and the realities of racism. She became immersed in black liberation theology literature during her time of teaching at the Howard University, School of Religion. She dedicated her time to the peace movement in Washington, DC, and she was arrested and taken to jail by police along with other radical Catholics and Protestants because of her participation in marches and demonstrations. 
After a brief stint as a visiting professor at Harvard Divinity School, Ruether accepted a position at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary and Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. She taught at Garrett-Evangelical for nearly 30 years, from 1976 to 2002, as the Georgia Harkness Professor of Applied Theology. During her career, Ruether authored over 40 books and over 600 articles, primarily on the topics of feminism, eco-feminism, the Bible, and Christianity. She also wrote several texts on Jewish-Christian relations, including "Faith and Fratricide: The Theological Roots of Anti-Semitism," and on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
After retiring from Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary, Ruether became the Carpenter Professor of Feminist Theology at the Pacific School of Religion and Graduate Theological Union. 
In addition to her academic work, Ruether participated in a number of organizations at the intersection of justice work, feminism, and Christianity. In 1977, Ruether became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP), an American nonprofit publishing organization that works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Additionally, she served as a board member of Catholics for Choice, an abortion rights advocacy group, and regularly wrote for "The National Catholic Reporter" and "Sojourners". Ruether was also an advocate of women's ordination, a movement among Catholics who affirm women's capacity to serve as priests, despite official church prohibition.
Declining health and death.
Ruether experienced a stroke that caused serious injury in 2016. She and her husband lived at Pilgrim Place, an intentional living community for seniors in Claremont, California, after her retirement. Ruether belonged to a women-church group in the community.
Ruether died on May 21, 2022, in a hospital in Pomona, California, after suffering a long-term illness. She was 85 years old at the time of her death. Ruether is survived by her three children and two grandchildren.
Feminist theology.
According to Ruether, the exclusion of women from theological academic and leadership roles has led to the proliferation of male-centric attitudes and beliefs. Without women invited to contribute to Christian theological dialogue and practices, women's experiences are neglected in theological beliefs and traditions. Ruether believed that classical theology and its traditions exclude women's experiences, which perpetuates the idea that women are secondary to men.
Ruether believed that feminist theology could expose and change inherently discriminatory theological systems. She argued that not only must the female experience be acknowledged and codified in theological spaces, but the very understanding of things such as experience and humanity must be reevaluated. 
Rather than attempting to replace patriarchal Christianity with feminist Christianity, Ruether advocated for a multiplicity of theological perspectives. She celebrated plurality rather than advocating for a singular, dominating approach to theology. In her 1983 book "Sexism and God-Talk," she opened up new Christological possibilities by posing the famous question, "Can a male savior save women?"
While Ruether remained in the Catholic Church for her entire life and career despite her disagreement with foundational doctrines and ecclesial practices, she continually challenged the Church's positions and policies. In an article published in 1985 by "The Christian Century", Ruether argued, "If the Catholic church can be wrong on birth control, it can be wrong on anything. If uncertainty exists about something which the church has taught with its full authority, then anything it teaches with its full authority may be wrong."
Ruether's work has been influential in the field of feminist theology, influencing scholars such as Beverly Wildung Harrison, Pauli Murray, and Kwok Pui Lan.
Personal life.
She married Herman J. Ruether, a political scientist, during her last year of college. In 2002, they co-authored the book "The Wrath of Jonah: The Crisis of Religious Nationalism in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict". They had three children together—two daughters and a son.
Reuther was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.
Honors and awards.
In 1975, Ruether's book "Faith and Fratricide: The Theological Roots of Anti-Semitism" was a finalist for the National Book Awards in the category of Philosophy &amp; Religion. In 1977, Ruether was installed as the Georgia Harkness Professor of Applied Theology at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary. This made her the first woman to hold an endowed chair at the seminary, a position she would hold until her retirement in 2002. Ruether's graduate students collaborated to author and publish "Voices of Feminist Liberation: Writings in Honor of Rosemary Radford Ruether" in 2012 as a festschrift in honor of Ruether's 75th birthday. 
Ruether received at least fourteen honorary doctorate degrees. Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary later provided a partial list that spanned ten years and included Denison University, Ohio (1982) and St. Bernard Seminary, New York (1992). On January 22, 2000, Ruether received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Theology at Uppsala University, Sweden. In 2012, Ruether received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (LHD) degree from Whittier College.

Down by the Salley Gardens

"Down by the Salley Gardens" ("Irish: Gort na Saileán") is a poem by William Butler Yeats published in "The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems" in 1889.
History.
Yeats indicated in a note that it was "an attempt to reconstruct an old song from three lines imperfectly remembered by an old peasant woman in the village of Ballisodare, County Sligo, who often sings them to herself." The "old song" may have been the ballad "The Rambling Boys of Pleasure" which contains the following verse:
The similarity to the first verse of the Yeats version is unmistakable and would suggest that this was indeed the song Yeats remembered the old woman singing. The rest of the song, however, is quite different.
Yeats's original title, "An Old Song Re-Sung", reflected his debt to "The Rambling Boys of Pleasure". The poem first appeared under its present title when it was reprinted in "Poems" in 1895.
Location.
It has been suggested that the location of the "Salley Gardens" was on the banks of the river at Ballysadare near Sligo where the residents cultivated trees to provide roof thatching materials. "Salley" or "sally" is a form of the Standard English word "sallow", i.e., a "willow" tree of the genus "Salix". It is close in sound to the Irish word "saileach", which also means "willow".
Musical settings.
The verse was set to music by Herbert Hughes to the traditional air "The Maids of Mourne Shore" in 1909. In the 1920s composer Rebecca Clarke (1886–1979) set the text to her own music. The composer John Ireland (18791962) set the words to an original melody in his song cycle "Songs Sacred and Profane", written in 192931. There is also a vocal setting by the poet and composer Ivor Gurney, which was published in 1938. Benjamin Britten published a setting of the poem in 1943, using the tune Hughes collected. In 1988, the American composer John Corigliano wrote and published his setting.
Hughes' setting is recorded by individuals and groups including:
Additionally, the same setting is sung in the films "Dancing at Lughnasa" (1998) and "The Children Act" (2017), as well as in the anime series "Fractale" (2011) as the ending theme.

<doc id="6903189" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6903189" title="TWA Flight 840 (1986)">
TWA Flight 840 (1986)

Trans World Airlines Flight 840 was a regularly scheduled international flight from Los Angeles to Cairo via New York City, Rome, and Athens on April 2, 1986. About 20 minutes before landing in Athens, a bomb was detonated on the aircraft while it was over Argos, Greece, blasting a hole in the plane's starboard side. Four passengers died after being blown out, while another seven were injured by flying shrapnel and debris. The dead were identified as Alberto Ospina, a Colombian-born American from Stratford, Conn.; Demetra Stylian, 52; her daughter, Maria Klug, 25, and her granddaughter, Demetra, 18 months old, all from Annapolis, Md. The aircraft then made a successful emergency landing with no further loss of life.
Aircraft.
The Boeing 727-231 involved in the incident was delivered to TWA in 1974, with the registration N54340. It was fitted with 3 P&amp;W JT8D-5 turbofan engines.
Flight.
The flight originated in Los Angeles on a Boeing 747 and transferred to a Boeing 727 in Rome for the remainder of the flight. After taking off from Rome, Italy, the flight remained uneventful until around 20 minutes before landing at Athens, when the aircraft was at around . A bomb hidden underneath seat 10F during an earlier leg of the flight detonated, blasting a hole in the starboard side of the fuselage in front of the wing.
Four American passengers, including an eight-month-old infant, were ejected through the hole to their deaths below. The victims were identified as a Colombian-American man; and a woman, her daughter, and her infant granddaughter. Seven others on the aircraft were injured by shrapnel as the cabin suffered a rapid decompression. However, as the aircraft was in the middle of its approach to Athens, the explosion was not as catastrophic as it would have been at a higher altitude. The remaining 110 passengers survived the incident as pilot Richard "Pete" Petersen made an emergency landing.
Aftermath.
The bodies of three of the four victims were later recovered from an unused Greek Air Force landing strip near Argos; the fourth was found in the sea.
A group calling itself the Arab Revolutionary Cells claimed responsibility, saying it was committed in retaliation for American imperialism and clashes with Libya in the Gulf of Sidra the week before.
The aircraft was substantially damaged but was repaired and returned to service until TWA ceased operations in 2001. The aircraft was scrapped in 2002.
Investigation.
Investigators concluded that the bomb contained one pound of plastic explosive. As the bomb was placed on the floor of the cabin, the explosion tore a hole downward, where the fuselage absorbed the most damage. It is suspected it had been placed beneath the seat on a previous journey by a Lebanese woman (later arrested, never convicted) who worked for the Abu Nidal Organisation, which was dedicated to the destruction of the state of Israel. They had previously hijacked and bombed several other aircraft, as well as committing various terrorist attacks in parts of the Middle East.

TWA Flight 840 (1969)

TWA Flight 840 was a Trans World Airlines flight from Leonardo da Vinci International Airport in Rome, Italy, to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, that was hijacked on 29 August 1969. There were no fatalities although at least two passengers were lightly wounded and the aircraft was significantly damaged. Two hostages were held for two months.
Hijacking.
In August 1969, leaders in the Palestinian left-wing organization Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) learned that Yitzhak Rabin, then Israeli ambassador to the United States, was scheduled to be aboard a Trans World Airlines (TWA) Rome–Athens–Tel Aviv flight. On 29 August two operatives, Leila Khaled and Salim Issawi, hijacked the aircraft. Rabin was not aboard, but American diplomat Thomas D. Boyatt was. The hijackers made the pilots land the aircraft at Damascus International Airport in Syria. They evacuated the aircraft, a Boeing 707, and blew up the nose section of the aircraft.
At the terminal, Khaled delivered a speech to the passengers, further explaining the motives of the hijacking. She said, "I assumed [Shadia Abu Ghazaleh's] name on flight 840 to tell the world about the crimes the Israelis inflict upon our people and to demonstrate to you that they make no distinctions between men, women and children. But for their own propaganda objectives they repeatedly state in your press how we attack their 'innocent' women and children and how cruel we are. I want you to know that we love children, too, and we certainly do not aim our guns at them. We diverted flight 840 because TWA is one of the largest American airlines that services the Israeli air routes and, more importantly, because it is an American plane. The American government is Israel's staunchest supporter. It supplies Israel with weapons for our destruction. It gives the Zionists tax-free American dollars. It supports Israel at world conferences. It helps them in every possible way. We are against America because she is an imperialist country."
The Syrian authorities arrested the hijackers and immediately released the 12 crew members and 95 passengers, retaining at first six Israeli passengers. Of those, four were released on 3 September. The remaining two Israeli passengers were released in December in return for 71 Syrian and Egyptian soldiers released by Israel. The two Palestinian hijackers had been released without charges in mid-October.
The aircraft sustained $4 million in damage. Boeing repaired the aircraft, fitting the nose section diverted from the production line at Renton and outfitted to the aircraft's specifications. The aircraft was re-registered N28714 and returned to service. In March 1980, the aircraft was withdrawn from service and flown to Davis–Monthan Air Force Base for use as spares for the KC-135 Stratotanker fleet of the United States Air Force. The aircraft's registration was canceled in March 1984.
Thomas Boyatt has received many medals and awards for his bravery and heroism during the hijacking, including a Meritorious Honor Award.

Jon Dee Graham

Jon Dee Graham is an American musician, guitarist and songwriter from Austin, Texas, United States. Graham was named the Austin Musician of the Year during the South by Southwest (SXSW) music conference in 2006. He was inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame three times: as a solo artist in 2000, again in 2008 as a member of The Skunks, and again in 2009 as a member of the True Believers.
The Skunks formed in 1978, with a lineup featuring Jesse Sublett on bass and vocals and Bill Blackmon on drums. Graham joined as their new guitarist (replacing Eddie Munoz, who departed to join The Plimsouls) in 1979. Graham's guitar can be heard on the band's live CD, "Live: Earthquake Shake", released in 2000.
The True Believers, which included Alejandro Escovedo and his brother, Javier Escovedo, are widely considered by critics to be seminal figures in the fusion of literary songwriting and punk rock, a sound often referred to as cowpunk, a subset of alternative country.
Jon Dee Graham went on to play with John Doe, Exene Cervenka, James McMurtry, Eliza Gilkyson, Kelly Willis, John Hiatt, Michelle Shocked, Patty Griffin, Calvin Russell, and Lone Justice.
His music has been featured in soundtracks such as "Ladder 49" and "Veronica Mars". In 1992, Patty Smyth covered Graham's song, "One Moment to Another" on her album, "Patty Smyth".
Career.
To date, Graham has released ten solo albums: "Escape from Monster Island" (1997, Freedom Records); "Summerland" (1999, New West Records); "Hooray for the Moon" (2002, New West Records); "The Great Battle" (2004, New West Records); "Full" (2006, Freedom Records); "Swept Away (Film Soundtrack) "(2008, Freedom Records) "It's Not As Bad As It Looks" (2010, Freedom Records), and "Garage Sale" (2012, Freedom Records), "Do Not Forget" (2015 Freedom Records), and "Knoxville Skyline" (2016, South Central). His 2004 record, "The Great Battle," was produced by Austin guitarist Charlie Sexton, a longtime member of Bob Dylan's band.
Graham's music generally explores the struggles adults face as they work to raise their children, maintain marriages and jobs, and grapple with the quick passage of time. Despite the heaviness of such themes, Graham's music is infused with a strong sense of the joys of life and the need to remain optimistic.
Graham's second son, Willie, suffered from a chronic, rare childhood disease called Legg-Perthes. In 2005, the Austin music community banded together in an effort to raise money for Willie's treatment. The resulting benefit concert at Austin's Continental Club became a CD/DVD release called "Big Sweet Life: The Songs of Jon Dee Graham." Musicians like Alejandro Escovedo, Bob Schneider, David Garza, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Ian McLagan, and Steve Poltz all contributed by covering Graham's tunes. An additional benefit concert, held the same night at the Saxon Pub, featured performances by Roky Erickson and the Skunks. Graham commuted the short distance between clubs to participate in both shows.
Over the years, Graham has been backed by Jim Keltner, Rafael Gayol, Mark Andes, Michael Hardwick, and Andrew Duplantis, who went on to play in Son Volt with Jay Farrar.
In early 2006, production began on a feature-length documentary on Graham and his music. Entitled, "Jon Dee Graham: Swept Away", it was released on DVD on May 20, 2008 and later made available to stream on Amazon Prime. The film was directed by a friend of Graham's, Mark Finkelpearl, who happens to be a documentary television professional with a background on the staffs of the Discovery Channel and National Geographic Television.
In August 2008, Graham underwent emergency surgery after being injured in a one-car accident.
In 2012, Susan Cowsill, Freedy Johnston, and Graham, working together as The Hobart Brothers and Lil' Sis Hobart, released a collaborative album on Freedom Records entitled "At Least We Have Each Other."
"Dreamer: A Tribute to Kent Finlay", released in early 2016 on Austin-based Eight 30 Records, features Graham's version of Finlay's "Taken Better Care of Myself". That year Graham performed at FitzGerald's American Music Festival.
In 2019, Graham announced plans and launched a fan-funding campaign to record a new album in conjunction with his 60th birthday.

Bishops Lydeard railway station

Bishops Lydeard railway station is a heritage railway station in the village of Bishops Lydeard, Somerset, England. It is the southern terminus for regular trains on the West Somerset Railway.
History.
B&amp;ER/GWR.
The station was first opened on 31 March 1862 when the West Somerset Railway was opened from Norton Junction to , operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&amp;ER). On opening the station had just one platform on the line's west side, with goods facilities consisting of a siding to a goods shed on the west, and a passing loop plus two sidings on the northeast was served by a passing loop and two sidings. There was also a house for the station master.
The B&amp;ER became part of the Great Western Railway in 1876, but the West Somerset Railway remained an independent company until 1922 when the Great Western absorbed it.
The second eastern platform was not added until 1906, together with a connecting footbridge. The standard-pattern GWR medium-scale signal box was also added at the end of the platform, operated via a 25-lever stud-locking frame. On 10 June 1936 the line was doubled from here to Norton Fitzwarren, resulting in the signal box being upgraded to a 32-lever frame.
British Railways.
Nationalisation in 1948 saw it become a part of the Western Region of British Railways. On 1 March 1970 the signal box was closed and its frame removed, and the track from Norton Fitzwarren through Bishop’s Lydeard and as far as Williton was operated as a single track. The station was closed by BR, along with the entire line, on 4 January 1971.
West Somerset Railway.
After the entire line and its trackbed were bought by Somerset County Council, the West Somerset Railway agreed to lease the line as a heritage railway, with the later possibility of operating timetabled service trains into via operating company, the WSR plc. Track remains to Norton Fitzwarren, controlled through a single token and colour light signals, to allow special trains and occasional goods trains to operate through from Network Rail to the WSR.
The WSR revived the line from its western end, starting at Minehead and operating to , before extending operations through to Bishops Lydeard on 9 June 1979. Initially the section west of Williton was operated as one-train-only, before the WSR began operating Bishops Lydeard as a terminus. After the society secured a new 33-lever frame in 1981, following extensive fund-raising, the station's loop was extended to its current length of , to allow for dual-platform arrival/departures. HM Railway Inspectorate approved the new plans in 1997, and the full system, including control of the Norton Fitzwarren section, came into use from August 1998.
Description.
Today the station has two operational platforms and is the headquarters of the West Somerset Railway Association.
The original No.1 platform, on the western side of the station, was extended yet further towards Taunton by the WSR to allow for dual-platform departure. The old goods shed has been restored and is used as a visitor centre and museum called the Gauge Museum, run by the West Somerset Railway Heritage Trust, its artefacts include a GWR sleeping car and the Trust's model railway layout. An adjacent building on the platform is home to the Taunton Model Railway Group’s model railway layout. The original station offices with modern toilets are now used by the West Somerset Railway Association.
The eastern-side 1906-built platform, No.2, is today the station's main operating platform. Accessed via a carpark to its rear, it contains the ticket office, toilets, shop and café, and the now enclosed signal box, with a platform extension towards Taunton that has made it considerably longer than platform 1. This extension provided for the inclusion of the Taunton-facing platform No.3, but this is only operated as a siding as movements onto the running lines are not direct; it is normally used to house the "Quantock Belle" dining cars.
The West Somerset Railway's southern locomotive stabling yard is also based here (southeast of platform 2, and not accessible to the public), which is where visiting locomotives arriving by road are unloaded onto the WSR.
Services.
Trains run between and at weekends and on some other days from March to October, daily during the late spring and summer, and on certain days during the winter. During special events a shuttle service runs between Bishops Lydeard and and from time to time special trains also run through onto Network Rail's tracks at . 
In 2019, the WSR entered into a partnership with the modern Great Western Railway (GWR) to operate services to Bishops Lydeard on occasional summer Saturdays from beginning on 27 July 2019 which ended on October 5, 2019. In May 2022 it was announced that the "Reconnecting Bishops Lydeard to Taunton Working Group" has been established to explore the possibility of reconnecting on the West Somerset Railway to for the purpose of reinstating scheduled trains.
Access.
For those outside the area, Bishops Lydeard is the WSR main access point:

Shin Ramyun

Shin Ramyun () is a brand of instant noodle (including cup ramyeon) that has been produced by the South Korean food company Nongshim since October 1, 1986. It is now exported to over 100 countries, and is the best-selling instant noodle brand in South Korea.
Shin Ramyun, well known for its spicy flavor, is produced in at least four varieties: the original Shin Ramyun and Shin Ramyun Black, which was introduced in 2011 as well as Super Spicy, which was released in 2019, and a shrimp flavor that is only available in China and Singapore. A standard package of Shin Ramyun consists of noodles, a packet of flavoring powder (soup base), and a packet of vegetable flakes. Shin Ramyun Black contains an extra packet of beef stock soup, which gives the soup a more intensely savory flavor. Additionally, an extra-spicy variant, Shin Red, was introduced in 2020.
History.
Shin Ramyun was introduced in October 1986 by Nongshim. The Nongshim R&amp;D team was inspired by "sogogi jangguk", a popular Korean spicy cabbage and beef stew.
After Shin Ramyun was introduced, Nongshim's share of the instant noodle market hit 46.3% in 1987, and exceeded 50% for the first time in 1988 (53.8%). With the market share of over 20% just by itself, Shin Ramyun is a leading brand of the instant noodles in Korea.
In 2007, Nongshim launched a kimchi-flavoured version of Shin Ramyun.
In August 2014, Nongshim revised its recipe for noodle blocks across its line for a chewier consistency, along with a revamped external packaging.
In 2015, Shin Ramyun achieved 28 billion units sold since it was first introduced. Shin Ramyun is listed on the National Brand Consumption Index (NBCI) as the number 1 brand in South Korea (2012–2016) for its brand awareness and brand power.
In 2019, Nongshim launched a non-fried version of its packet noodle which has almost half a reduction on calories.
In 2023, Shin Gold (chicken flavor) and Shin Green (tofu and mushroom flavor) were introduced in the U.S.
Name and package.
"Shin Ramyun" is the English transliteration of the Korean words for "spicy instant noodles". Shin Ramyun uses red and black packaging with the emphasized calligraphic form of the Hanja character "辛", which means "spicy". Additionally, the character is the surname of both the founder of Nongshim, Shin Choon-ho, and his elder brother, Shin Kyuk-ho, who started Lotte.
Products.
Shin Ramyun was first introduced in 1986. There are two types of Shin Ramyun in the U.S., one is packaged and the other cup noodle. A package of Shin Ramyun is 120g, and there are 4 sizes of Shin Ramyun cup/bowls: Shin Cup Noodle Soup (68g), Shin Bowl Noodle Soup (86g), Shin Ramyun M-Cup (75g) and Shin Big Bowl Noodle Soup (114g). In Japan, there is the Shin Ramyun mini cup.
Shin Ramyun Black was introduced in April 2011, which was 25 years after Shin Ramyun was first introduced to the market. Shin Ramyun Black is a slightly different version of Shin Ramyun with an additional "seolleongtang" powder on top of its flavor. Other ingredients include boiled beef slices, garlic and shiitake mushrooms. In the U.S. there are two types of Shin Ramyun Black: a Package type (130g) and a cup/bowl type (Shin Black Cup Noodle, 101g). There is also a Shin Black M-Cup (75g).
Shin Ramyun Red "Super Spicy" was launched in late 2019, in both standard packet form and the smaller instant cup size, using the same noodle blocks and vegetable packet but a much spicier soup base.
A shrimp flavor is also available in China.
International distribution.
Shin Ramyun is the most popular instant noodle brand to date in South Korea. It is now accounting for one quarter of the Korean instant noodle market. Shin Ramyun is now exported to over 100 countries around the world, and is produced in three countries: the United States, China and South Korea. As of 2015, accumulated sold units of Shin Ramyun in the world reached 28 billion units.
Marketing and advertising.
In South Korea.
As part of the marketing strategies, Nongshim uses "사나이 울리는 신라면" (romanization: Sanai Ullineun Shin Ramyun; translation: "Shin Ramyun can make a man cry"). The word "sanai" () is used to describe the man while emphasizing the masculinity.
Most of its commercials include a famous male celebrity, frequently with his family, who is eating Shin Ramyun at home. These commercials emphasize being family friendly, being Korean, and folksiness. Psy, a South Korean singer who is well known for his song "Gangnam Style," and Park Ji-Sung and Son Heung-min, South Korean footballers, also filmed Shin Ramyun commercials.
Nongshim has many jingles for their products. Adding a simple yet catchy jingle at the end of their commercials is one of Nongshim's important marketing strategies. They are easy to remember, and most people in South Korea are aware of them.
In China.
In China, Nongshim uses a slogan: 사나이라면 매운맛을 먹을 줄 알아야지 (Simplified Chinese: 吃不了辣味非好汉; Translation: (He who cannot handle spice is not a true man). This slogan is from a famous phrase in China "不到长城非好汉 (He who has never been to the Great Wall is not a true man)" by Mao Zedong.
Being aware of the historical importance of the board game "baduk" (popularly known as "go") in China, Nongshim has been sponsoring an annual Baduk Championship, the Nongshim Cup, as part of their marketing strategies since 1999.
In Japan.
In Japan, Nongshim has set 10 April as a Shin Ramyun day since 2010. The date was chosen for its similarity in pronunciation with "Hot" () when the Japanese pronunciation of the number 4 in English is combined with the Japanese word for 10.
The Japanese word "umakara" () has been used to describe the flavor of Shin Ramyun.
As part of the main marketing projects, Nongshim offers "Shin Ramyun Kitchen Car", a food truck that offers consumers a chance to taste Shin Ramyun, since 2013. Every year, the truck travels across Japan for seven months, promoting Shin Ramyun to Japanese consumers. As of April 2016, the truck has hosted a total of 150 tasting sessions, and travelled more than 100,000 kilometers.

Sideroxylon

Sideroxylon is a genus of trees in the family Sapotaceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753. They are collectively known as bully trees. The generic name is derived from the Greek words σιδηρος ("sideros"), meaning "iron", and ξύλον ("xylon"), meaning "wood."
Distribution.
The genus is distributed mainly in North and South America as well as in Africa, Madagascar, southern Asia, and various oceanic islands. Some species, such as gum bully ("S. lanuginosum"), "S. tenax", and buckthorn bully ("S. lycioides"), are found in subtropical areas of North America. The only South African species, the white milkwood ("S. inerme"), is associated with three historical sites, and these individuals were declared national monuments due to their unusual longevity.
Ecology.
Several species have become rare due to logging and other forms of habitat destruction. The tambalacoque ("S. grandiflorum") of Mauritius was affected by the extinction of the birds which dispersed its seed; it was suggested that the species entirely depended on the dodo ("Raphus cucullatus") for that purpose and nearly became a victim of coextinction, but this is not correct. Bully trees provide food for the larvae of certain Lepidoptera, such as the bumelia webworm moth ("Urodus parvula") as well as several species of Coleoptera of the genus "Plinthocoelium", commonly known as bumelia borers.
Species.
83 species are currently accepted.

John Ferguson (Presbyterian minister)

John Ferguson (27 December 1852 – 1 March 1925) was a Scottish-born Australian Presbyterian minister.
Early life.
John Ferguson was born on 27 December 1852, at Shiels, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the third son of William Ferguson, a farmer, and his wife Elizabeth, née Mitchell. He migrated to Otago, New Zealand, with his parents in 1862.
Upon leaving school at the age of 14, he became a pupil-teacher, and also acted as laboratory assistant in the chemistry department at the University of Otago. Ferguson soon realised his desire to enter the ministry, and subsequently, the congregation of Knox Church at Dunedin, gave him a bursary to complete the full course at New College, Edinburgh.
Career.
Licensed as a probationer by the Free Church presbytery of Deer at Stuartfield, Old Deer, Aberdeenshire, Ferguson returned to Otago and was ordained to the ministry on 20 May 1880. He was then sent to work with the miners at Tuapeka in the Central Otago goldfields.
Ferguson married Isabella Adie, from Old Deer, on 4 February 1881 at Dunedin. He soon became colleague and successor to A. Stobo at Invercargill, where he remained in full charge for fourteen years. In August 1894 Ferguson was inducted to St Stephen's, Phillip Street, Sydney, the largest Presbyterian congregation in Australia. His ministry in Sydney was very successful.
Ferguson took full part in Australian religious and public life, becoming moderator-general in 1909. His inaugural address, published as "The Economic Value of the Gospel", caused controversy in Melbourne and praise from trade union leaders. Labor politician William Morris (Billy) Hughes (who was to become Prime Minister in 1915), said: 
As the senior Presbyterian chaplain in New South Wales, Ferguson preached on many special occasions, including the arrival of H.M.A.S. Australia and the memorial services at the end of the South African War and World War I. Ferguson's ecumenical interests led him to seek an audience with the Pope on a visit to Rome in 1914, an action that evoked much criticism in Sydney.
On 22 May 1913, following the resignation of Andrew Harper, Ferguson was appointed Senior Chaplain and chairman of the exclusive Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney Council, retiring in 1923 due to ill health. Whilst in this role, he actively worked towards the planning and establishment of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Pymble in 1916, a branch of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney. He was also the first chairman of the board of the Australian Inland Mission, a member of the Council of The Scots College and St Andrew's Theological College, and vice-president of the Highland Society of New South Wales. He was also to become the Acting Principal of St Andrew's Theological College at the University of Sydney in 1917.
It is said that Ferguson was a "tall, dark-haired man, with a drooping moustache and a commanding presence. An attractive preacher, with a genial and informal friendliness, he seldom forgot a face or a name and few entered St Stephen's without a warm personal greeting. He was admired and respected by all the Churches."
Death.
In October 1924, Ferguson collapsed in the pulpit of St. Stephen's Church and subsequently died at his home, 'Atherton', on Bayswater Road, on 1 March 1925. He was survived by his wife, three sons, including Sir John, judge of the New South Wales Industrial Commission and author of the "Australian National Bibliography"; Eustace, a notable pathologist and entomologist, and by two daughters. He was buried at South Head Cemetery in Sydney.
Legacy.
Following Ferguson's death, a memorial hall and tablet were erected at St Stephen's Church, Sydney in his honour. Ferguson House at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney is also named after him.

French destroyer Ouragan

Ouragan (French: "hurricane") was a ("torpilleur d'escadre") built for the French Navy during the 1920s. During World War II, the destroyer began the war in service with the French Navy and was undergoing repairs at Brest during the invasion of France. The British Royal Navy towed the destroyer to the United Kingdom and commandeered the vessel following the French surrender in 1940. They transferred "Ouragan" to the Polish Navy which kept the destroyer in service for less than a year. In 1941, the Polish Navy transferred the destroyer to the Free French Naval Forces, which in turn, transferred "Ouragan" back to the Royal Navy in 1943. "Ouragan" saw no further action and was broken up for scrap in 1949.
Design and description.
The "Bourrasque" class had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of . The ships displaced at (standard) load and at deep load. They were powered by two geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three du Temple boilers. The turbines were designed to produce , which would propel the ship at . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at .
The main armament of the "Bourrasque"-class ships consisted of four Canon de Modèle 1919 guns in shielded single mounts, one superfiring pair each fore and aft of the superstructure. Their anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of a single Canon de Modèle 1924 gun. The ships carried two triple mounts of torpedo tubes amidships. A pair of depth charge chutes were built into their stern that housed a total of sixteen depth charges.
Construction and career.
During the first year of World War II, "Ouragan" served with the 4th Destroyer Division with the destroyers and , based at Brest. At the time of the German invasion of France in 1940, she was undergoing engine repairs at Brest. The Royal Navy towed her to Devonport where the repairs were completed. After the French surrender in June, the British commandeered her on 3 July and she was transferred to the Polish Navy on 17 July 1940. Until 30 April 1941 she sailed under the Polish ensign (using pennant number H16) but as OF "Ouragan" (OF - Okręt Francuski - "French ship"), instead of the usual ORP prefix. She was commanded by Lieutenant Commander T. Gorazdowski; most of "Ouragan"s crew were transferred from , which had been sunk on 4 May 1940, during the Battle of Narvik.
"Ouragan" participated in operations around the British Isles, during which she suffered storm damage (flooded engine and boiler rooms) and a series of debilitating technical problems, requiring a total of 194 days under repair (compared to 31 days at sea). On 30 April 1941, after 287 days in Polish service, "Ouragan" was returned to the Free French Forces, who in turn passed her to the Royal Navy in 1943. She never returned to active operations, was decommissioned on 7 April 1949 and scrapped.

Saky Municipality

The Saky City Municipality (, translit. "Saks'ka mis'krada") is one of the 25 regions of the Crimean Peninsula, internationally recognized as part of Ukraine, but currently occupied by Russia. The region is located on the western coast of Crimea on the Black Sea's shore. Its administrative centre is the city of Saky. In 2014, the population stood at 25,146.
Unlike in the other regions and municipalities of Crimea which contain a number of other settlements under its jurisdiction, the Saky municipality only consists of its administrative center Saky.
Name.
The Saky City Municipality is also known by two other native official names; in Russian as "Sakskiy gorsovet" (), and in Crimean Tatar as . Colloquially, the municipality is known as "the territory governed by the Saky City Council" ().
Administrative divisions.
Within the framework of administrative divisions of Russia, Saky is, together with a number of rural localities, incorporated separately as the "town of republican significance of Saki"—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of republican significance of Saki is incorporated as "Saki Urban Okrug".
Within the framework of administrative divisions of Ukraine, Saky is incorporated as the "town of republican significance of Saky". Ukraine does not have municipal divisions.
2020 Ukrainian Administrative Reform.
In July 2020, Ukraine conducted an administrative reform throughout its de jure territory. This included Crimea, which was at the time occupied by Russia, and is still ongoing as of October 2023. Crimea was reorganized from 14 raions and 11 municipalities into 10 raions, with municipalities abolished altogether.
Saky Municipality was abolished, and its territories to become a part of Yevpatoria Raion, but this has not been implemented due to the ongoing Russian occupation.
Government.
The Saky City Council's members are elected every four years, with 21 councillors elected in single-mandate districts, and 21 councillors in a multiple mandate district.
Demographics.
The Saky municipality's population was 28,522 as of the 2001 Ukrainian Census and 25,146 in 2014 according to the 2014 Crimean Census.
The region's nationality composition in the 2001 census was:

Sheila Lerwill

Sheila W. Lerwill (née Alexander; born 16 August 1928) is a British retired athlete who competed mainly in the high jump and competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics.
Biography.
Alexander, born in London and originating from Streatham, she finished third behind Gladys Young in the high jump event at the 1947 WAAA Championships and second behind Dorothy Tyler at the 1949 WAAA Championships. She gained revenge on Tyler the following year by defeating her at the 1950 WAAA Championships.
She played netball for England and Surrey. She lived on Glenister Park Road.
In 1950 she was trained by George Pallett and took the British record on 5 August 1950 at 5 ft 6.5. She married Michael H. M. Lerwill, from Westerham, on Saturday 31 March 1951 at Holy Redeemer Church in Wandsworth and competed under her married name Lerwill thereafter.
During the 1951 WAAA Championships on 7 July 1951 at White City Stadium, Lerwill broke the world record for women's high jump, with a jump of 1.72 metres, beating the previous record of 1.71 metres set by Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands on 30 May 1943 in Amsterdam. (The record was broken on 22 May 1954 by Aleksandra Chudina of the USSR in Kiev with a jump of 1.73 metres).
Her rivalry with Dorothy Tyler continued as she finished second to her at the 1952 WAAA Championships. One month later she competed for Great Britain in the high jump at the 1952 Summer Olympics, held in Helsinki, Finland, where she won the silver medal with a jump of 1.65 metres. It was Britain's best athletics medal at the games.
Lerwill defeated Thelma Hopkins and Tyler to claim the 1953 WAAA Championships high jump title but finished second behind Jean Desforges in the long jump. The following year at the 1954 WAAA Championships, Lerwill won another WAA high jump title.

Biography.
Hopkins was born in Kingston upon Hull but grew up in Belfast as a child; she had one older sister.
Hopkins finished third behind Dorothy Tyler in the high jump event at the 1952 WAAA Championships.
At both the 1953 WAAA Championships and 1954 WAAA Championships she was defeated by Sheila Lerwill in the high jump competition.
In the 1954 Commonwealth Games she won a gold medal for Northern Ireland in high jump. Later that year, she got the gold medal in high jump for Great Britain at the 1954 European Athletics Championships.
Hopkins became a double British champion in 1955, winning the national high jump title and national long jump title at the 1955 WAAA Championships.
On 5 May 1956, Hopkins set a new world high jump record with a leap of 1.74 metres in Belfast, erasing the mark of 1.73 metres set by Aleksandra Chudina of the USSR on 22 May 1954. Her record was broken on 14 July 1956 in Bucharest by Iolanda Balaș of Romania. Olympic gold medallist Mary Peters called Hopkins her "inspiration". Coached by Franz Stampfl, she competed for Great Britain in the 1956 Summer Olympics held in Melbourne, Australia in high jump , where she jointly won the silver medal with Mariya Pisareva.
Hopkins completed another double of national championships when winning the 80 metres hurdles and high jump at the 1957 WAAA Championships.
As well as athletics she excelled at hockey where she was a regular choice for the Ireland women's national field hockey team, playing at forward and winning 40 caps. She also represented Ireland as an international squash player.
She was one of many signatories in a letter to "The Times" on 17 July 1958 opposing 'the policy of apartheid' in international sport and defending 'the principle of racial equality which is embodied in the Declaration of the Olympic Games'.
Hopkins moved to Canada, where she died on 10 January 2025, at the age of 88 in Edmonton.

<doc id="6903423" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6903423" title="Neck (band)">
Neck (band)

Neck are a six-piece London-Irish Celtic punk band from the North London neighbourhood of Holloway led by Leeson O'Keeffe who was a member of Shane MacGowan and the Popes. The band was influenced by two other London bands: The Clash and The Pogues, blending Punk rock with traditional Irish music to play a London-Irish style known as 'Psycho-Cèilidh' where a "cèilidh" is an Irish social gathering with Gaelic folk music. 
O'Keeffe died in April 2024 of cancer.
History.
1990s.
The band was formed in 1994 by Irish emigrants and second-generation Irish residents of Holloway. In 1999 Neck released "The Psycho-Ceilídh EP" and also appear performing two songs, the traditional "Carrickfergus" and the original "The Ferry Fare", in Belfast-set, Film 4 romantic comedy-drama "With or Without You", directed by Michael Winterbottom.
2000s.
In 2000, the Neck appeared at Glastonbury for their first time and then they released their first album in 2001.
They toured extensively throughout the US, Europe, UK, and Ireland during the 2000s. Neck appeared at every Glastonbury from 2004 until 2008 , including twice at 2007.
They played numerous international festivals such as the Tantsy festival in Moscow Hermitage Garden; the Dublin Irish Festival in Ohio – the second-largest Irish festival in the US; South by Southwest in Texas in 2006; Paas Pop in Holland; The West Belfast Féile an Phobail in Northern Ireland and the Spraoi in Ireland; Punk &amp; Disorderly festival as well as With Full Force in Germany. In the UK they appeared at The Levellers' own festival Beautiful Days, Solfest, Boomtown Fair all multiple times and the Rebellion Festival, ten times.
Neck's third album "Sod 'Em &amp; Begorrah!", released in 2005, was well received critically being ranked the second or third greatest Celtic punk album of all time, the latter behind only The Pogues and Flogging Molly.
They released an anti-racism / pro-inclusiveness anthem "Everybody's Welcome to the Hooley!" in 2006 which charted in the UK Indie Chart. The version of the song on the single also references and is dedicated to, Stephen Lawrence and Anthony Walker, two black British teenagers murdered in racially motivated attacks. Proceeds from the single went to Love Music Hate Racism.
Their fourth album "Come Out Fighting!" was delayed until 2009 by tour commitments.
In the 2000s their music also appeared on various motion picture soundtracks such as the "surreal" "Pirates of the White Sand" short (2005); "The Emerald Diamond", a 2006 documentary film about the Irish National Baseball Team – contributing four songs, including the traditional "Star of the County Down" and the original "Every Day's Saint Patrick's Day"; the Boston-set Gang War Shoot-'em Up "Beantown" (2007); and the "Capraesque" homage to 'Small Town America Coming of Age' "The Supermarket" (2009). 
2010s.
"Come Out Fighting!" was pushed back in the US and Europe until 2010. They appeared on Flogging Molly's Salty Dog cruise out of Miami in 2018.
Influence.
Their music reflects the life experience of the emigrant and second-generation Irish diaspora, with O'Keeffe's voice and song-writing considered faithful to the form, and in direct lineage from his former band-leader and mentor, Shane MacGowan of the Pogues. 
Over half their members came from the London Irish traditional music session scene and their musicianship has earned them respect and admiration. They often perform acoustic "Unplugged / Irish traditional music session" sets, alongside full electric ones, with one performance at 'The Irish House' during the London 2012 Olympics sufficiently impressive that they were chosen by the Irish Cultural Centre in London to have the honour of performing a seisiún at the reception for the Irish Paralympic team at the London 2012 Paralympics. O'Keeffe was given the honour by Sinn Féin, to host such sessions for any social functions that they stage in London, including the centenary celebrations for the Easter Rising at the Portcullis House.
Their reputation led to various members being invited to collaborate both live and on other band's recordings. The most well known is O'Keeffe appearing, on banjo, with the Alabama 3 (alongside Segs of Ruts DC), and co-writing an original song "That's It, I Quit" on the Hayseed Dixie album "No Covers". He has also played in the folk punk group Folk Finger alongside Cush and Ricky McGuire from The Men They Couldn't Hang and his old band-mate Danny Heatley from The Popes – including touring Ireland and a New Year's Eve show in Prague; and also 'depped' for the front-man of steampunk band The Men That Will Not Be Blamed for Nothing at the Glastonbury Festival.
They have been recognized as one of the leading bands on the international Celtic punk and folk punk scenes, alongside their US contemporaries Dropkick Murphys and Flogging Molly, with the Boston-based website covering the Celtic punk scene, Shite 'n' Onions, being named after one of their songs. Bands from Germany and the United States have covered their songs and O'Keeffe has been referenced in songs by other bands.

Temporal analysis of products

Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP), (TAP-2), (TAP-3) is an experimental technique for studying
the kinetics of physico-chemical interactions 
between gases and complex solid materials, primarily heterogeneous catalysts. 
The TAP methodology is based on short pulse-response experiments at low background pressure (10−6-102 Pa), 
which are used to probe different steps in a catalytic process on the surface of a 
porous material including diffusion, adsorption, 
surface reactions, and desorption.
History.
Since its invention by Dr. John T. Gleaves (then at Monsanto Company) in late 1980s, 
TAP has been used to study a variety of industrially and academically relevant catalytic reactions, bridging the gap between surface science
experiments and applied catalysis. 
The state-of-the-art TAP installations (TAP-3) do not only provide better signal-to-noise ratio than the first generation TAP machines (TAP-1),
but also allow for advanced automation and direct coupling with other techniques.
Hardware.
TAP instrument consists of a heated packed-bed microreactor connected to a high-throughput vacuum system, 
a pulsing manifold with fast electromagnetically-driven gas injectors, and a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS) 
located in the vacuum system below the micro-reactor outlet.
Experiments.
In a typical TAP pulse-response experiment, very small (~10−9 mol) and narrow (~100 μs) gas pulses are introduced into the evacuated (~10−6 torr) microreactor
containing a catalytic sample. While the injected gas molecules traverse the microreactor packing through the interstitial voids,
they encounter the catalyst on which they may undergo chemical transformations. Unconverted and newly formed gas molecules eventually
reach the reactor's outlet and escape into an adjacent vacuum chamber, where they are detected with millisecond time resolution
by the QMS. The exit-flow rates of reactants, products and inert molecules recorded by the QMS are then
used to quantify catalytic properties and deduce reaction mechanisms. The same TAP instrument can
typically accommodate other types of kinetic measurements, including atmospheric pressure flow experiments (105 Pa), 
Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD), and Steady-State Isotopic Transient Kinetic Analysis (SSITKA).
Data analysis.
The general methodology of TAP data analysis, developed in a series of papers by Grigoriy (Gregory) Yablonsky 
 
is based on comparing an inert gas response which is controlled only by Knudsen diffusion 
with a reactive gas response which is controlled by diffusion as well as adsorption and chemical reactions on the catalyst sample.
TAP pulse-response experiments can be effectively modeled by a one-dimensional (1D) diffusion equation with uniquely simple combination of boundary conditions.

Folded unipole antenna

The folded unipole antenna is a type of monopole mast radiator antenna used as a transmitting antenna mainly in the medium wave band for AM radio broadcasting stations. It consists of a vertical metal rod or mast mounted over and connected at its base to a grounding system consisting of buried wires. The mast is surrounded by a "skirt" of vertical wires electrically attached at or near the top of the mast. The skirt wires are connected by a metal ring near the mast base, and the feedline feeding power from the transmitter is connected between the ring and the ground.
It has seen much use for refurbishing medium wave AM broadcasting station towers in the United States and other countries. When an AM radio station shares a tower with other antennas such as FM broadcasting antennas, the folded unipole is often a good choice. Since the base of the tower connects to the ground system, unlike in an ordinary mast radiator tower in which the base is at high voltage, the transmission lines to any antennas mounted on the tower, as well as aircraft lighting power lines, can be run up the side of the tower without requiring isolators.
Invention.
The folded unipole antenna was first devised for broadcast use by John H. Mullaney, an American radio broadcast pioneer, and consulting engineer. It was designed to solve some difficult problems with existing medium wave (MW), frequency modulation (FM), and amplitude modulation (AM) broadcast antenna installations.
Typical installation.
Since folded unipoles are most often used for refurbishing old broadcast antennas, the first subsection below describes a typical monopole antenna used as a starting point. The subsection that follows next describes how surrounding skirt wires are added to convert an ordinary broadcast tower into a folded unipole.
The picture at the right shows a small folded unipole antenna constructed from an existing triangular monopole tower; it has only three vertical wires comprising its "skirt".
Conventional monopole antennas.
A typical monopole transmitting antenna for an AM radio station is a series-fed mast radiator; a vertical steel lattice mast which is energized and radiates radio waves. One side of the feedline which feeds power from the transmitter to the antenna is connected to the mast, the other side to a ground (electricity) system consisting of buried wires radiating from a terminal next to the base of the mast. The mast is supported on a thick ceramic insulator which isolates it electrically from the ground. US FCC regulations require the ground system to have 120 buried copper or phosphor bronze radial wires at least one-quarter wavelength long; there is usually a ground-screen in the immediate vicinity of the tower. To minimize corrosion, all the ground system components are bonded together, usually by using brazing or coin silver solder.
The mast has diagonal guy cables attached to it, anchored to concrete anchors in the ground, to support it. The guy lines have strain insulators in them to isolate them electrically from the mast, to prevent the high voltage from reaching the ground. To prevent the conductive guy lines from disturbing the radiation pattern of the antenna, additional strain insulators are sometimes inserted in the lines to divide them into a series of short, electrically separate segments, to ensure all segments are too short to resonate at the operating frequency.
In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires that the transmitter power measurements for a single series-fed tower calculated at this feed point as the current squared multiplied by the resistive part of the feed-point impedance.
Electrically short monopole antennas have low resistance and high capacitive (negative) reactance. Depending on desired recipients and the surrounding terrain, and particularly depending on locations of spacious expanses of open water, a longer antenna may tend to send signals out in directions that are increasingly more advantageous, up to the point that the antenna's electrical height exceeds about  wavelengths tall.
Reactance is zero only for towers slightly shorter than  wavelength, but the reactance will in any case rise or fall depending on humidity, dust, salty spume, or ice collecting on the tower or its feedline.
Regardless of its height, the antenna feed system has an impedance matching system housed in a small shed at the tower's base (called a "tuning hut" or "coupling hut" or "helix hut"). The matching network is adjusted to join the antenna's impedance to the characteristic impedance of the feedline joining it to the transmitter. If the tower is too short (or too tall) for the frequency, the antenna's capacitive (or inductive) reactance will be cancelled out with the opposite reactance by the matching network, as well as raising or lowering the feedpoint resistance of the antenna to match the feedline's characteristic impedance. The combined limitations of the matching network, ground wires, and tower can cause the system to have a narrow bandwidth; in extreme cases the effects of narrow bandwidth can be severe enough to detract from the audio fidelity of the radio broadcast.
Electrically short antennas have low radiation resistance, which makes normal loss in other parts of the system relatively more costly in terms of lost broadcast power. The losses in the ground system, matching network(s), feedline wires, and structure of the tower all are in series with the antenna feed current, and each wastes a share of the broadcast power heating the soil or metal in the tower.
Folded unipole antennas.
Heuristically, the unipole's outer skirt wires can be thought of as attached segments of several tall, narrow, single-turn coils, all wired in parallel, with the central mast completing the final side of each turn. Equivalently, each skirt wire makes a parallel wire stub, with the mast being the other parallel "wire"; the closed end at the top of the stub, where the skirt connects to the mast, makes a transmission line stub inductor. Either way of looking at it, the effect of the skirt wires is to add inductive reactance to the antenna mast, which helps neutralize a short mast's capacitive reactance.
For the normal case of a short monopole, the inductive reactance introduced by the skirt wires decreases as the frequency decreases and the bare mast's capacitive reactance increases. With increasing frequency, up to frequency where the skirt is a quarter wavelength, the inductive reactance rises and capacitive reactance drops. So for a short antenna, the skirt's inductance and the mast's capacitance can only cancel at a single frequency, since the reactance magnitudes increase and decrease in opposite manner with frequency.
With a longer antenna mast, at least a quarter-wave tall, the reactances can be more elaborately configured: The contrary reactances can be made to cancel each other at more than one frequency, at least in part, and to rise and fall by approximately the same amount. Approximate balance between the opposing reactances adds up to reduce the total reactance of the whole antenna at the decreased (and increased) frequencies, thus widening the antenna's low-reactance bandwidth. However, there is nothing particularly remarkable about a longer antenna having a wider low-reactance bandwidth.
If the greater part of the unbalanced radio current can be made to flow in the skirt wires, instead of in the mast, the outer ring of skirt wires will also effectively add electrical width to the mast, which also will improve bandwidth by causing the unbalanced currents in the unipole to function like a "cage antenna".
Usually folded-unipoles are constructed by modifying an existing monopole antenna, and not all possible unipole improvements can be achieved on every monopole.
The resulting skirt enveloping the mast connects only at the tower top, or some midpoint near the top, and to the isolated conducting ring that surrounds the tower base; the skirt wires remain insulated from the mast at every other point along its entire length.
Unipole electrical operation and design.
Balanced and unbalanced currents are important for understanding antennas, because unbalanced current always radiates, and close-spaced balanced current never radiates. The following sketch of how a unipole antenna works separately considers the balanced and unbalanced currents flowing through the antenna. The sum of the two is the actual current seen in any one conductor.
Total current broken into balanced and unbalanced parts.
By the electrical superposition principle, the total currents flowing in the antenna can be considered as split into the sum of independent balanced and unbalanced currents. The balanced and unbalanced parts of the antenna's currents add to make the "true" current profile; equivalently, if we call the "true" current measured flowing through the mast formula_2 and formula_3 the sum of all the "true" currents measured in the skirt wires (by symmetry assumed to all be the same) then the balanced and unbalanced parts of the "true" currents are
Going the other way, the "true" currents in the mast and skirt, from the conceptual balanced and unbalanced currents are
So as an example, from a simplified point of view, the distinction between an antenna and its feedline, is that the balanced current flows anti-parallel in the feedline, which does not radiate, and is rechanneled into unbalanced, vector parallel paths inside the antenna, which do radiate.
Balanced feed current.
The electrical behavior of the skirt and mast can be thought of as similar to a coaxial feedline, with the skirt corresponding to the coax's outer shield, and the mast serving as the core wire, or center conductor. The connection of the skirt and mast at the top acts as a short at the end of the virtual coax, and because the "coax" is, by design, less than a quarter wave long at the attachment point it is effectively an inductive shorted stub. Regardless of the configured skirt and mast sizes and spacing, which determine the impedance seen by the balanced current, the feed current circulating through the skirt and the mast produce a voltage difference between the top and the skirt feed point and between the top and ground plane which is half of the voltage difference between the feedpoint and the ground (possibly with exceedingly minor variations).
The only current considered so-far is balanced: The same total feed current rises up the skirt wires as flows down through the mast to the ground-level feedpoint (or vice versa), and back through the (balanced) feedline, making an electrically closed circuit. The magnetic fields of the current flowing up are equal and opposite to the current flowing down, so the magnetic fields (very nearly) all cancel, and consequently balanced currents (mostly) do not radiate. So the situation on the antenna after considering just the balanced feed current is that it creates a voltage difference between the antenna top and the ground plane, and nothing in terms of radio waves. That voltage difference serves as an electrical exciter of an unbalanced current.
Unbalanced radiating current.
If one then considers separately the antenna from the "point of view" of any prospective unbalanced current, it sees an unbalanced voltage between the connection point near the top of the mast and the ground plane at the antenna base. (For RF analysis, the backwards path through the feedpoint to the radio is treated as a virtual path to ground, ignoring the balanced feed current.) The self-cancelled balanced currents won't electrically affect the unbalanced currents (other than having created the voltage difference in common to all), although they do add to make the "true" current profile in the antenna.
There are two possible paths that unbalanced current can take in response to the voltage difference between the top and the bottom: Either down (or up) through the mast, or down (or up) through the skirt wires. Because the currents along each path are driven by the same voltage, they will flow in the same direction. The current divides in proportion to the admittance (reciprocal impedance) of each path to ground. The amount of current along each path is determined by the sizes and number of the wire(s) along each path, and to some extent the mutual impedance of the adjacent conductors (mast and skirt wires) and the currents flowing in those wires (parallel currents in adjoining wires crowd out each other's magnetic fields, making it harder to push the current through). All unbalanced current radiates; the radiation from the several vector-parallel current paths all add.
Design choices and results.
Compared to balanced currents through the same two conductors, the electrical impedance countering the flow of unbalanced currents is very high – roughly 500~600 Ω and higher, depending mostly on the wire diameter, but also rising with closer or larger parallel currents in adjacent wires. The impedance against the flow of balanced currents is roughly 300~500 Ω and lower, depending mostly on the spacing between the wires, dropping when wires are more closely spaced. Consequently, the flow of balanced current will tend to be larger in magnitude than its unbalanced counterpart, and the difference becomes greater the closer the conductors are spaced.
The electrical design of a unipole antenna lies in choosing the sizes and number of the skirt wires, their lengths, and (if possible) the size of the central mast, in order to adjust the relative impedances (or admittances) of the balanced and unbalanced current, in order to maximize radiation and to present a reactance-free balanced feedpoint impedance for the feedline. (Other design considerations, like cost of materials and ease of erection, may lead to choices sub-optimal for electrical performance.)
Because of the large number of free design parameters, compared to other antenna types, an exceedingly diverse variety of different unipole antennas can be made, and their performance will all be different. Unlike a commonly used antenna such as the simple doublet, there is no "typical unipole" performance figure. That being said, however, field testing discussed below shows that when just considering antenna efficiency, the power radiated per power fed to a unipole is very nearly the same as an ordinary monopole antenna with the same height: Other than the advantage of being able to tailor the feedpoint impedance, there appears to be no inherent superior performance for unipoles' when compared to a basic monopole. The only unipole design advantage boils down to it having an elaborately configurable built-in feedpoint impedance matching system.
Performance comparisons.
When a well-made folded-unipole replaces a decrepit antenna, or one with a poor original design, there will of course be an improvement in performance; the sudden improvement may be cause for mistakenly inferred superiority in the design.
Experiments show that folded-unipole performance is the same as other monopole designs: Direct comparisons between folded unipoles and more conventional vertical antennas of the same height, all well-made, and with nearly equivalent radiator widths, show essentially no difference in radiation pattern in actual measurements by Rackley, Cox, Moser, &amp; King (1996) and by Cox &amp; Moser (2002).
The expected wider bandwidth was also not found during antenna range tests of several folded unipoles.
Replaced shunt-fed antenna.
Most commonly, folded-unipole designs were used to replace a shunt-fed antenna – a different broadcast antenna design that also has a grounded base. A "shunt-fed" (or "slant-wire") antenna comprises a grounded tower with the top of a sloping single-wire feed-line attached at a point on the mast that results in an approximate match to the impedance desired at the other end of the sloping feed-wire.
If a well-made folded-unipole antenna replaced an aged-out slant-fed antenna, station engineers could notice a marked improvement in performance. Such improvements may have provoked conjectures that folded-unipole antennas had power gains, or other wonderful characteristics, but those suppositions are not borne out by radio engineering calculations.
Ground system maintenance.
Sites of ground-mounted monopole antennas require landscape maintenance: Keeping weeds and grass covering the antenna's ground plane wires as short as possible, since green plants in between the antenna tower and the antenna ground system will dissipate power of the radio waves passing through them, reducing antenna efficiency. Folded-unipole antenna sites were alleged to be less affected by weeds and long grass on top of the ground wires that cause attenuation in other monopole antenna designs, but measurements show no such advantage.
Self-resonant unipole patents.
A possible improvement over the basic folded-unipole antenna is the "self resonant" unipole antenna, described in .
Another possible improvement to the folded unipole is described in , which concerns a more carefully designed form of ground plane for use with all monopole types (only incidentally including folded unipoles).

Contractor ratings

Contractor rating systems, also known as contractor prequalifications, are one of the larger cost-saving practices available and more routinely applied by governmental organizations as a means of avoiding the high cost and inflated pricing that results from reduced competition on public work by using bonding and surety to guarantee performance of public work.
Years ago, public purchasing officials began applying prequalification and short-listing of pre-selected contractors for bidding on public procurement contracts. A subjective process is in many places the exclusive means of getting on a bidders list for public contract work.
These ratings and processes now make the whole issue of bonding and surety, (that has been around since the late 19th century to guarantee of performance and paying large premiums), obsolete and redundant since the public officials have already reduced risks and are paying premiums associated with reducing competition by using the prequalification process and rating systems.

Kuba Kingdom

The Kuba Kingdom, also known as the Kingdom of the Bakuba or Bushongo, is a traditional kingdom in Central Africa. The Kuba Kingdom flourished between the 17th and 19th centuries in the region bordered by the Sankuru, Lulua, and Kasai rivers in the heart of the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The Kuba Kingdom was a conglomerate of several smaller Bushong-speaking principalities as well as the Kete, Coofa, Mbeengi, and the Kasai Twa Pygmies. The original Kuba migrated during the 16th century from the north. Nineteen ethnic groups are included in the kingdom, which still exists and is presided over by the King ("nyim").
History.
Shyaam a-Mbul.
The kingdom began as a conglomeration of several chiefdoms of various ethnic groups with no real central authority. In approximately 1625, an individual from outside the area known as Shyaam a-Mbul a Ngoong usurped the position of one of the area rulers and united all the chiefdoms under his leadership. Tradition states that Shyaam a-Mbul was the adopted son of a Kuba queen. He left the Kuba region to find enlightenment in the Pende and Kongo kingdoms to the west. After learning all he could from these states, he returned to Kuba to form the empire's political, social and economic foundations.
A new government.
The Kuba government was reorganized toward a merit-based title system, but power still remained firmly in the hands of the aristocracy. The Kuba government was controlled by a king called the "nyim" who belonged to the Bushoong clan. The king was responsible to a court council of all the Kuba subgroups, who were represented equally before the king by their elites. The kingdom had an unwritten constitution, elected political offices, separation of political powers, a judicial system with courts and juries, a police force, a military, taxation, a significant public goods provision and socially supporting movements.
Growth.
As the kingdom matured, it benefited from advanced techniques adopted from neighboring peoples as well as New World crops introduced from the Americas, such as maize, tobacco, cassava and beans. Kuba became very wealthy, which resulted in great artistic works commissioned by the Kuba nobility. The Kuba kings retained the most fanciful works for court ceremony and were also buried with these artifacts.
Early in the 18th century the ruler of Kuba was Kuete M'bogi. During his reign Kuba extended its power further south along the Kasai River. This expansion was continued under Koto Nche who was Also a king of Kuba during the 18th century.
Apex.
The Kuba Kingdom reached its apex during the mid-19th century. Europeans first reached the area in 1884. Because of the kingdom's relative isolation, it was not as affected by the slave trade as were the Kongo and Ndongo kingdoms on the coast.
The current reigning monarch, Kot-a-Mbweeky III, has been on the throne since 1968.
Kuba culture.
Kuba art.
The Kuba are known for their raffia embroidered textiles, fiber and beaded hats, carved palm wine cups and cosmetic boxes, but they are most famous for their monumental helmet masks, featuring exquisite geometric patterns, stunning fabrics, seeds, beads and shells. 
The boxes, known as Kuba Boxes and called "ngedi mu ntey" by the Kuba, are generally used to hold "tukula" powder and paste. The boxes are usually in the shape of a square with a faceted lid, a semicircle (sometimes referred to as "half moon"), a rectangle or the shape of a mask. Sometimes they were used for holding razors for cutting raffia, hairpins or ritual objects.
"Tukula" (called "twool" by the Kuba) is a red powder made of ground cam wood. The color red is essential to the Kuba concept of beauty and was therefore used to ornament the face, hair and chest during dances and important ceremonies, as well as to anoint bodies for burial. "Tukula" was also mixed with other pigments to dye raffia cloth.
After 1700, King Misha mi-Shyaang a-Mbul introduced wooden sculptures called "ndop" figures that were carved to resemble the king and represent his individual reign. These figures always included the king's "ibol" or personal symbol, akin to a personal standard.
The carved palm-wine drinking cups and ornately carved boxes are identified with competition between titled court members among the Kuba. With half of all Bushoong men holding titles in the 1880s, competition for influence was sometimes fierce, and it found expression in the elaboration of these essentially commonplace household objects into works of extraordinary beauty.
Kuba religion and mythos.
The Kuba believed in Bumba the Sky Father who spewed out the sun, moon, stars, and planets. He also created life with the Earth Mother. However these were somewhat distant deities, and the Kuba placed more immediate concern in a supernatural being named Woot, who named the animals and other things. Woot was the first human and bringer of civilization. The Kuba are sometimes known as the "Children of Woot."

Egan Range

The Egan Range is a line of mountains in White Pine County, in eastern Nevada in the western United States. From Egan Creek near the historic community of Cherry Creek, the range runs south for approximately , extending south of Shingle Peak in the northern part of Lincoln County. To the east are the large Steptoe Valley and the even longer Schell Creek Range. To the west are the White River Valley and the scenic White Pine Range. To the north is the Cherry Creek Range, while to the south is remote Cave Valley and the southern tip of the Schell Creek Range. It is named after the Egan Family that live in Montville.
The southern section of the range rises steadily, climbing to the high ridge of Ward Mountain. This crest is over long and, at elevations up to , includes the highest point of the range. The mountains then descend rapidly to the north, dropping to elevations below 6200 feet near the community of Ely.
North of Ely the Egan Range rises again at Heusser Mountain (), approximately 5 miles west of the community of McGill. This northern group of mountains (which might be considered as a separate range) continues to Telegraph Peak (), and then descends to Egan Creek, almost merging with the Cherry Creek Range.

Schuylkill Navy

The Schuylkill Navy is an association of amateur rowing clubs of Philadelphia. Founded in 1858, it is the oldest amateur athletic governing body in the United States. The member clubs are all on the Schuylkill River where it flows through Fairmount Park in Philadelphia, mostly on the historic Boathouse Row.
By charter, the Schuylkill Navy’s object is "to secure united action among the several Clubs and to promote amateurism on the Schuylkill River." Over the years, the group has had a role in certain ceremonial and state functions. The success of the Schuylkill Navy and similar organizations contributed heavily to the extinction of professional rowing and the sport's current status as an amateur sport.
At its founding, it had nine clubs; today, there are 16: Fairmount Rowing Association, Crescent Boat Club, Bachelors Barge Club, University Barge Club, Malta Boat Club, Vesper Boat Club, College Boat Club, Penn Athletic Club Rowing Association (Penn AC), Undine Barge Club (Undine), Philadelphia Girls' Rowing Club (PGRC), Gillin Boat Club, Conshohocken Rowing Center, Pennsylvania Barge Club, Whitemarsh Boat Club, Sedgeldy, and Pennsylvania Center for Adapted Sports. At least 23 other clubs have belonged to the Navy at various times. Many of the clubs have a rich history, and have produced a large number of Olympians and world-class competitors.
Origins.
The Schuylkill Navy was founded by nine Philadelphia rowing clubs seeking a governing body to prevent fixed races. Once formed, the Navy enacted a code of conduct that prohibited wagering on races.
These clubs were present at the founding of the society in October 1858: America, Camilla, Chebucto, Falcon, Independent, Keystone (the 1st), Neptune (the 1st), Pennsylvania (the 1st), and University. Later that month, Amateurs, Nautilus, and Quaker City joined. While not at that first meeting, Undine and Bachelors joined the Navy soon after its founding. Bachelors absorbed member, Amateurs, in December 1858, and became a member in March 1859. While Undine was not initially listed as a founder, it is considered a founder of the Navy because one of Undine's members was the Secretary Treasurer of the Navy at its inception.
In March 1860, Union Boat Club and Atlantic Barge Club (the 1st) joined the Schuylkill Navy. In September 1860 the founding club, Camilla Boat Club, resigned. By June 1861, Falcon, Pennsylvania, and Atlantic had dissolved. Half of the remaining Schuylkill Navy clubs lapsed during the Civil War. As of August 1865 Chebutco, Excelsior, Union, Independent, and Keystone no longer existed.
After the Civil War.
 Rowing resumed at the end of the Civil War, but many of the fledgling post-war clubs did not last. On August 17, 1865, Pennsylvania Barge Club (the 2nd) and Philadelphia Barge Club were elected to the Navy. Five days later Malta Boat Club and Washington Boat Club (now known as Vesper) joined.
In 1867 the Navy admitted Iona (the 1st), but Iona terminated its membership after it became part of Crescent Boat Club, which joined in 1868. In April 1868 rowers split from Neptune to form the second Atlantic Boat Club. Keystone (the 2nd) joined the Navy in February 1870, but resigned by the end of the year. Washington Boat Club was renamed Vesper Boat Club in 1870, then resigned in 1871, and was not a member again until 1879. Bachelors resigned in 1870 and did not rejoin until 1882. West Philadelphia Barge Club and College Boat Club joined in 1873 and 1875 respectively.
On November 11, 1872, the Navy composed the funeral solemnities of General George Meade. In 1876, it held an international regatta in connection with the Centennial Exposition, the largest of its kind to that point. On April 27, 1878, crews from various clubs of the Navy staged a demonstration to honor President Rutherford B. Hayes's visit to Philadelphia.
A new Iona Boat Club, chartered in 1876, joined the Navy in 1884, and lasted until 1895. Fairmount Rowing Association, in existence since 1877, was admitted in 1916. In 1924, Penn Athletic Club Rowing Association absorbed West Philadelphia Boat Club. In 1932, under the pressures of the Great Depression, Quaker City Barge Club and Philadelphia Barge Club closed their doors.
After World War II.
World War II dramatically reduced the membership rolls of the clubs of the Schuylkill Navy. As a result, Crescent Boat Club resigned and leased its boathouse to LaSalle Rowing Association from 1951 until 1960. Pennsylvania Barge Club (the 2nd) ceased rowing in 1955. Pennsylvania turned its boathouse over to the Navy until its membership was reinstated in 2009.
In 1968, Philadelphia Girls' Rowing Club, a women-only club, became a member of the Schuylkill Navy. Most recently, Gillin Boat Club was elected to the Navy by unanimous vote in 2004.
21st century.
The Schuylkill Navy is the organizer of the Philadelphia Classic Regatta Series. With three of the largest regattas in the mid-Atlantic region on the schedule as well as two of the nation's oldest regattas, the Philadelphia Classic Regatta Series connects the rowing competitors of today to the historic home of the international rowing elite. It is built on a tradition that launched November 12, 1835, with the first organized regatta on Philadelphia's historic Schuylkill River (a full eight years before the start of the rowing program at Harvard University).
In 2010, USRowing, the national governing body for rowing, announced the launch of a new Training Center Partner Program in order to create partnerships with clubs across the country interested in collaborating in the development of athletes who could potentially represent the United States in international races. The partner program places an emphasis on training athletes in small boat development and incorporating athletes in senior and under-23 camps and trials. Partners include Schuylkill Navy's Penn AC and Vesper Boat Club. Partner programs will have access to national team training programs, and have the opportunity to consult with USRowing National Team staff and the Director of Coaching Education, Kris Korzeniowski.
In 2016, the composite crew racing as Schuylkill Navy won the Prince of Wales Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta.
Traditions.
Events.
The Navy also sponsors other athletic endeavors including a basketball league and an annual cross country race.
Schuylkill Navy Run
The Schuylkill Navy Run, also known as the Turkey Trot, began in 1899. Held on Thanksgiving Day, the race has been a tradition for rowers in the Philadelphia region ever since, with the exception of two years during World War I and two years during World War II. It begins at Malta Boat Club on Kelly Drive, and continues over 5 5/8 miles of hilly terrain. The runners go inbound on Kelly Drive to the traffic light in front of Lloyd Hall, turn left and go up Lemon Hill and over the Girard Avenue Bridge, then right onto Lansdowne Avenue. Just past Sweetbriar Cutoff, the course turns right and starts the true “cross country” segment across grassy surfaces. Runners go to the General Meade Monument, then follow to the Pagoda entrance gate to Belmont Plateau, up the hill to Belmont Mansion, and return by way of Brewery Hill down Kelly Drive back to Malta Boat Club.
Any and all members of The Schuylkill Navy clubs and its affiliates are eligible to compete, as well as friend and family guest runners. The classifications include the following categories: Open, Masters, Juniors, Guests, and Novices.
Member clubs.
Current members.
Established in 1877 and located at No. 2 Boathouse Row, Fairmount is on the National Register of Historic Places. Fairmount gained admission to the Schuylkill Navy in 1916 after it had been rejected for decades. In 1945 the boathouse underwent a huge expansion in which it merged with what was No. 3 on Boathouse Row to create the current Fairmount Rowing Association boathouse. Fairmount has called itself the "premiere club for Masters rowing in the mid-Atlantic region". Recently the club has produced several world class rowers. The club is currently coached by Ahsan Iqbal and is affiliated with La Salle University and Episcopal Academy.
Founded in 1861 and located at No. 4 Boathouse Row, the Pennsylvania Barge Club is also known as the Hollenback House, after William M. Hollenback Jr., who from 1979 to 1985 served as the president of the governing body of rowing, USRowing. It is alleged that painter Thomas Eakins was a member of the Pennsylvania Barge Club as he frequently painted rowers, and one of his close friends, Max Schmitt, is known to have rowed for the club and won the single sculls national championship 6 times. Pennsylvania Barge Club represented the United States at the Summer Olympic Games in 1920 (coxed four), 1924 (coxed four), 1928 (coxed four and four without coxswain) and 1932 (pair with coxswain). In 1955, due to World War II the boathouse suffered a severe decrease in membership and turned its facility over to the National Association of Amateur Oarsmen, which would later become USRowing, to serve as their headquarters. In 2009 Pennsylvania Barge Club was reinstated as a member of the Schuylkill Navy; the club's current president is Michael Ragan, and it is affiliated with La Salle College High School.
Established in 1867 and located at No. 5 Boathouse Row, Crescent Boat Club was one of the first members of the Schuylkill Navy. The club began to be known as Crescent when Pickwick Barge Club and Iona Barge Club merged. Crescent won the double sculls in the first National Association of Amateur Oarsmen regatta, currently known as the USRowing Club National Championships. After World War II, the club, like many others on Boathouse Row, suffered a dramatic decrease in membership and turned the operation of the boathouse over to the La Salle Rowing Association, which controlled it from 1951 to 1960. By 1974 the boathouse was vacant, and was not returned to prosperity until it came under the reins of John Wilkins. The club is now affiliated with Thomas Jefferson University's rowing team and Roman Catholic High School rowing team, which supplies most of Crescent's summer rowing membership. Crescent has the smallest membership to the Schuylkill Navy on Boathouse Row.
Located at No. 6 Boathouse Row, Bachelors was founded in 1853 and is the oldest continuously operating boathouse in the United States. Founding members of Bachelors were members of a volunteer fire-fighting club called the Phoenix Engine Company. Israel Morris is credited with founding the club, and was elected as its second president. As the name of the club suggests, membership was restricted to "Bachelors"; however shortly after its founding Bachelors opened its doors to married men. Now the vast majority of the club's 150 members are women. Bachelors medaled at the Summer Olympic Games in the single sculls and the coxed four in 1924, the single sculls in 1928, and the double sculls in 1932. More recently Bachelors sent Cody Lowry to the World Rowing Championships in 2009 in the lightweight men's single sculls. Bachelors is currently affiliated with the Conestoga High School, Lower Merion High School, and Radnor High School Men's and Women's teams, along with the Drexel University Men's and Women's teams and a number of smaller programs and independent high school scullers. 
Commonly referred to as UBC, the club is located at No. 7 Boathouse Row, and is designated as a National Historic Landmark. Established in 1854 by 10 members of the University of Pennsylvania's freshman rowing class, UBC founded the Schuylkill Navy in 1858. The club's beginnings are considered to be "the dawn of organized athletics at the University of Pennsylvania" as at first membership was restricted solely to University of Pennsylvania students, later opening to alumni in 1867. UBC is known as "the upper-class rowing club", as when it opened to the public most of its members were aristocracy and upper class citizens of the city of Philadelphia. UBC is currently affiliated with the Chestnut Hill Academy high school boys' rowing team and the Springside School high school women's rowing team.
The Malta Boat Club is located at No. 9 Boathouse Row and joined the Schuylkill Navy in 1865, after its establishment in 1860 when it relocated from the Delaware River to the Schuylkill River, occupying what was the Excelsior Club boathouse. 
In 1901 Malta became the tallest boathouse on Boathouse Row after George W. and William D. Hewitt designed the third story of the boathouse. Malta currently does not have any strong affiliations, although some boats from The Shipley School are stored there.
Established in 1865 and located at No. 10 Boathouse Row, Vesper joined the Schuylkill Navy in 1870. In 1873 Vesper built, in conjunction with Malta, a 1 1/2 story boathouse. The boathouse has since been renovated, largely based ondesigns by Howard Egar in 1898. 
Vesper's stated goal is "to produce Olympic champions." This was most recently accomplished by Andrew Byrnes, Gold for Canada, and Josh Inman, Bronze for the United States, both in the Men's 8+ 2008 Summer Olympics. Vesper, along with its national team and Olympic aspirations, is affiliated with several high schools including Archbishop Prendergast, Friends Select School, and Sacred Heart.
Located at No. 11 Boathouse Row, College Boat Club houses the University of Pennsylvania rowing teams. College Boat Club houses the Men's, Women's and Lightweight squads, and its constituency is entirely made up of past rowers. The boathouse was established in 1872 after the University of Pennsylvania moved its campus from Center City to West City, and became a member of the Schuylkill Navy in 1875. College Boat Club was admitted to the Schuylkill Navy in 1875. It was initially founded to give University of Pennsylvania students an alternative to the school's original Boathouse, University Barge Club. In 1877 University of Pennsylvania rowers from the club beat the University of Pennsylvania rowers from University Barge Club, making College Boat Club the official hub for most University of Pennsylvania rowers by 1879. By 1893 membership was opened to alumni and enrolled students.
Otherwise known as Penn AC, the club is located at No. 12 Boathouse Row and was founded in 1871 as the West Philadelphia Boat Club. The club became known as Penn AC in 1924, and joined the Schuylkill Navy in 1925. Penn AC has been a hub for elite and US National Team rowers since John B. Kelly Sr. joined the club after a falling out with his former club, Vesper. The club is currently affiliated with the Shipley School boys' and girls' rowing teams and the Monsignor Bonner High School boys' team, both of which have brought Stotesbury Cup wins back to the club in recent years.
Established in 1856 and located at No. 13 Boathouse Row, Undine joined the Schuylkill Navy in 1858 and is considered a founding member. Both the boathouse (1882–83) and the clubhouse upstream, Castle Ringstetten (1875), were designed by architect Frank Furness. The club is currently affiliated with the rowing teams from Penn Charter and the Baldwin School. The club is also known for its motto "Labor ipse voluptas" (in English: Labor itself is a pleasure).
Otherwise known as PGRC, the club is located at No. 14 Boathouse Row and is the oldest all-female rowing club in the world. Built in 1860, it is the oldest structure on Boathouse Row, and was originally constructed for the purpose of housing the Philadelphia Skating Club and Humane Society. Although not formally established until 1938, PGRC was formed by 17 women (mainly wives of rowers at other clubs who wished to partake in the activity of rowing). PGRC was formally admitted into the Schuylkill Navy in 1967, and currently hosts the girls' rowing team from the Agnes Irwin School.
Although not on historic Boathouse Row, Gillin Boat Club sits on the 1,000 meter mark of the famous Schuylkill River 2,000 meter race course. Admitted into the Schuylkill Navy in 2004, Gillin hosts the St. Joseph's University and St. Joe's Prep rowing teams. The boathouse was the first built on this up-river portion of the Schuylkill River in 98 years.

Boca Express Train Museum

The Boca Express Train Museum, operated by the Boca Raton Historical Society, is housed in a restored 1930 Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) train station in Boca Raton, Florida. designed by Chester G. Henninger, built for Clarence H. Geist. It is located at 747 South Dixie Highway, off U.S. 1 (Federal Highway). On October 24, 1980, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
That the building was restored and turned into a museum must be credited to the philanthropist Countess de Hoernle, who bought the abandoned building as a present for her husband.
Use as a passenger train station.
Historically, the station served several long-distance trains and one or two local trains. Into the early 1960s, passengers could take one of two Chicago-bound trains (on alternating days), the "City of Miami" or the "South Wind" (both via Birmingham) and the New York City-bound "East Coast Champion," "Havana Special," and "Miamian" from the FEC's station. Into the latter 1950s, passengers could take the "Dixie Flagler" to Chicago via Atlanta from the station. The FEC operated local passenger service between Jacksonville and the Miami area until July 31, 1968.

The museum contains two restored and unique 1947 Seaboard Air Line streamlined rail cars, a dining and a lounge car, built by the Budd Company and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Boca Express Train Museum also includes a 1946 Atlantic Coast Line caboose and a 1930 Baldwin steam switch engine.
For sale.
The Boca Raton Historical Society put the Train Museum up for sale in 2017, saying that maintaining two historic buildings (the other is the Society's home, Boca Raton's first city hall) is draining the nonprofit's resources.

Blue Rondo à la Turk

"Blue Rondo à la Turk" is a jazz standard composition by Dave Brubeck. It appeared on the album "Time Out" in 1959. It is written in time, with one side theme in and the choice of rhythm was inspired by the Turkish aksak time signatures. It was originally recorded by the Dave Brubeck Quartet with Dave Brubeck on piano, Paul Desmond on alto saxophone, Eugene Wright on bass, and Joe Morello on drums.
History.
Brubeck heard this unusual rhythm performed by Turkish musicians on the street. Upon asking the musicians where they got the rhythm, one replied "This rhythm is to us what the blues is to you." Hence the title "Blue Rondo à la Turk."
Contrary to popular belief, the piece is neither inspired by nor related to the last movement of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11, known by the near-identical title "Rondo Alla Turca".
The rhythm is an additive rhythm that consists of three measures of followed by one measure of and the cycle then repeats. Taking the smallest time unit as eighth notes, then the main beats are:
\new RhythmicStaff {
 \clef percussion
 \time 9/8
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 150
 c4 c c c4.
 c4 c c c4.
 c4 c c c4.
 c4. c c
&lt;/score&gt;
Derivative pieces.
Rock keyboardist Keith Emerson used this piece (uncredited) as a foundation of his "Rondo" beginning when he was with the progressive rock band The Nice; it appeared on the album "The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack". Emerson's version was in time and Brubeck, meeting with Emerson in 2003, described it to him as "your 4/4 version which I can't play." Emerson, a great admirer of Brubeck, took this to mean that Brubeck preferred his own version, as Brubeck would have had no difficulty in playing Emerson's interpretation.
Later, Emerson folded the melody into the 14-minute "Finale (Medley)" on the 1993 Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer (ELP) release "Live at the Royal Albert Hall", as well as improvisations on "Fanfare for the Common Man". Those medleys also included themes from other well-known tunes including "America" from "West Side Story", "Toccata and Fugue in Dm", and "Flight of the Bumblebee".
Emerson frequently used "Rondo" as a closing number during performances both with The Nice and ELP.
On his 1981 album "Breakin' Away", Al Jarreau performed a vocal version of the song, with lyrics by himself.
Popular culture.
The track is used in the soundtracks of the 2005 comedy film "Wedding Crashers", the 2003 Swedish documentary "Närvarande", and an Emmy-award winning 2019 episode of "The Simpsons" entitled "Mad About the Toy".

Ligustrum sinense

Ligustrum sinense (Chinese privet; syn. "L. villosum"; in Mandarin: 杻; pinyin: chǒu) is a species of flowering plant in the family "Oleaceae". This privet is native to China, Taiwan and Vietnam, and invasive in Réunion, the Andaman Islands, Norfolk Island, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama and much of the eastern and southern United States (from Texas and Florida north to Kansas, Illinois, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Connecticut). The name "Chinese privet" may also refer to "Ligustrum lucidum".
Description.
"Ligustrum sinense" is a deciduous shrub growing to 2–7 m tall, with densely hairy shoots. The leaves are opposite, 2–7 cm long and 1–3 cm broad, rarely larger, with an entire margin and a 2–8 mm petiole. The flowers are white, with a four-lobed corolla 3.5–5.5 mm long. The fruit is subglobose, 5–8 mm diameter, and considered poisonous.
Varieties.
The following varieties are accepted by the "Flora of China":
Cultivation and uses.
It is cultivated as an ornamental plant and for hedges. Several cultivars have been selected, including the very floriferous 'Multiflorum', the variegated cultivar 'Variegatum', and the dwarf cultivar 'Wimbei' growing to 0.5 m and with leaves only 6 mm long.
It was introduced to North America to be used for hedges and landscaping where it has now escaped from cultivation and is listed as an invasive plant in southeastern states. It is estimated that Chinese privet now occupies over one million hectares of land across 12 states ranging from Virginia to Florida and west to Texas, with detrimental effects to biodiversity and forest health. 
Etymology.
"Ligustrum" means 'binder'. It was named by Pliny and Virgil.

Thomas Gilbert (politician)

Thomas Gilbert ( – 18 December 1798) was a British lawyer, soldier, land agent and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1773 to 1794. As one of the earliest advocates of poor relief, he played a major part in the Relief of the Poor Act 1782.
Early life.
Gilbert was the son of Thomas Gilbert of Cotton, Staffordshire. He entered Inner Temple in 1740 and was called to the bar in 1744. In 1745 he accepted a position in the regiment created by Lord Gower, the brother-in-law of the Duke of Bridgewater. His first wife was named Miss Phillips whom he married between December 1761 and January 1762. When he married her he bought her a lottery ticket, and she won one of the largest prizes in the country. She died on 22 April 1770 and he married secondly to Mary Crauford daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel George Crauford.
Political career.
Gilbert was a Member of Parliament for Newcastle-under-Lyme from 1763 to 1768 and for Lichfield from 1768 to 1795. He held many titles throughout his career in parliament and was a very active member. In 1765 the title Sinecure Place of Comptroller of the Great Wardrobe was given to him, and he kept it until it was eliminated by Burke's bill which reformed the civil list. Gilbert also held the long named office of Paymaster of the Fund for Securing Pensions to the Widows of Officers in the Navy. On 31 May 1784 he received his most important post, the Chairmanship of Committees of Ways and Means. Although he became the chairman of these offices, his passion was helping the poor. He dedicated the majority of his life's work to aiding the less fortunate. In 1765 he brought to the House of Commons a bill that would group parishes for poor-law purposes in greatly populated districts, but it was rejected in the House of Lords by 66 votes to 59. In 1778, while Britain was still at war with the American colonies, he proposed to parliament a tax of twenty-five per cent should be enforced upon all government places and pensions. Many people were against a tax this high and called it absurd but it was still carried in the committee but later turned down.
Relief of the poor.
Gilbert then turned his attention to improved highways, but was only able to pass acts for local roads. In 1776 a committee of the House of Commons wrote a report on conditions in factories and workhouses. During the 1780s there was an increase in unemployment which was attributed to an increase in food prices, low wages, and a decrease in available land. These factors led to an increase in the poor population and wealthy landowners turned to Gilbert. In 1782, his name was given to the Relief of the Poor Act 1782
In 1787 Gilbert introduced another bill related to poor relief. It proposed grouping many parishes together, for tax purposes, and imposing an additional charge for the use of turnpikes on Sundays. He also advocated the abolition of ale-houses in the country districts, except for the use of travellers, and their stricter supervision. He also wished to do away with imprisonment for small debts, implemented by a bill passed in 1793.
Later life and legacy.
Gilbert died at Cotton in Staffordshire on 18 December 1798. His friend John Holliday printed anonymously a monody on his death, praising his generosity in building and endowing in 1795 the chapel of ease of St. John the Baptist at Lower Cotton. Gilbert and his first wife had two sons, one joined the navy and the other became a clerk to the privy council.

A study of Thomas Gilbert (and his younger brother John) is in "Agents of Revolution", written by Peter Lead and published by the Centre for Local History, University of Keele in 1989. ( )

Wei Yuan

Wei Yuan (; April23, 1794March26, 1857), born Wei Yuanda (), courtesy names Moshen () and Hanshi (), was a Chinese scholar from Shaoyang, Hunan. He moved to Yangzhou, Jiangsu in 1831, where he remained for the rest of his life. Wei obtained the provincial degree ("juren") in the Imperial examinations and subsequently worked in the secretariat of several statesmen such as Lin Zexu. Wei was deeply concerned with the crisis facing China in the early 19th century; while he remained loyal to the Qing dynasty, he also sketched a number of proposals for the improvement of the administration of the empire.
Biography.
From an early age, Wei espoused the New Text school of Confucianism and became a vocal member of the statecraft school, which advocated practical learning in opposition to the allegedly barren evidentiary scholarship as represented by scholars like Dai Zhen. Among other things, Wei advocated sea transport of grain to the capital instead of using the Grand Canal and he also advocated a strengthening of the Qing Empire's frontier defense. In order to alleviate the demographic crisis in China, Wei also spoke in favor of large scale emigration of Han Chinese into Xinjiang.
Later in his career he became increasingly concerned with the threat from the Western powers and maritime defense. He wrote "A Military History of the Holy Dynasty" (《聖武記》, "Shèngwǔjì", known at the time as the "Shêng Wu-ki"), the last two chapters of which were translated by Edward Harper Parker as the "Chinese Account of the Opium War". Wei also wrote a separate narrative on the First Opium War (《道光洋艘征撫記》, "Dàoguāng Yángsōu Zhēngfǔ Jì"). Today, he is mostly known for his 1844 work, "Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms", which contains Western material collected by Lin Zexu during and after the First Opium War. The main principles advocated in the work were later absorbed by the institutional reforms known as the Self-Strengthening Movement.
British India was suggested as a potential target by Wei Yuan after the Opium War.
The creation of a government organ for translation was proposed by Wei.

Franklin Mieuli

Franklin Mieuli ( ; September 14, 1920 – April 25, 2010) was a San Francisco Bay Area radio and television producer who was best known as the principal owner of the San Francisco / Golden State Warriors from 1962 to 1986. The pinnacle of his 24 years with the franchise was its National Basketball Association (NBA) Championship in 1975. He was also a minority shareholder in both the San Francisco 49ers and Giants.
An eccentric personality, Mieuli eschewed formal attire and conservative grooming in favor of a casual wardrobe and his ever-present full beard and deerstalker. His preferred mode of transportation was the motorcycle.
Mieuli passed away in Oakland, California at age 89 due to natural causes
Early years.
Mieuli, the second son of Italian immigrants from Castellana Grotte, Apulia, was born in San Jose, California on September 14, 1920. His father Giacomo and older brother Jack Jr. owned and operated Navlet's Nursery in the East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area).
Mieuli graduated from San Jose High School in 1940 and the University of Oregon with a bachelor's degree in 1945.
In the early 1950s, Mieuli was the local promotions man for Burgermeister Beer ("Burgie"). His association with the 49ers led him to land the team's star fullback, Joe "The Jet" Perry, on his own sports and music radio program, "Both Sides Of The Record", sponsored by Burgie, on R&amp;B-formatted KWBR (1310 AM; later known as KDIA) beginning in 1954.
Mieuli also produced the 49ers radio broadcasts on KSFO beginning in the 1950s, and produced the first televised 49ers game in 1954. He subsequently produced Giants radio broadcasts, hosted by Russ Hodges and Lon Simmons upon the team's move from New York by owner Horace Stoneham in 1958.
Mieuli was influential in the hiring of sportscaster Bill King, initially the third man in the Giants broadcast booth in 1958, behind Hodges and Simmons. Upon Mieuli's purchase of the Warriors in 1962, King left Giants radio to become play-by-play voice of the newly minted "San Francisco Warriors". Coincidentally, at the time of Mieuli's purchase of the team, he was still producing the KSFO broadcasts of the Giants, 49ers, and the Warriors.
In 1956, Mieuli purchased five reel-to-reel audiotape duplicators from Ampex for use in distributing sports and music programming to radio stations. The venture led him to create Hi*Speed Duplicating Company, the first business of its kind in Northern California. In 1960, Mieuli produced national radio coverage of the VIII Winter Olympic Games at Squaw Valley. This was the start of his long-standing radio and television production company, Franklin Mieuli &amp; Associates.
On January 8, 1958, Mieuli was granted a construction permit for a new FM radio station in San Francisco, which went on the air on Thursday, December 10, 1959, as KPUP (106.9 FM); the station is now the FM portion of all-news KCBS radio's simulcast. Reflecting Mieuli's love for the style of music, KPUP programmed a Jazz music format, drawing from the rich variety of artists and recordings that were popular at the time, as well as Mieuli's friendship with Saul Zaentz of Fantasy Records. (The San Francisco Giants' 1962 season highlights, narrated by Russ Hodges and Lon Simmons and produced by Mieuli, were released on a long-playing record by Fantasy, catalog number GB-1962.)
KPUP's call letters were changed to the jazzier-sounding KHIP in July 1960. To help finance his purchase of the Warriors, Mieuli sold KHIP to Leon Crosby in June 1962 for $146,000; Crosby renamed the station KMPX.
Golden State Warriors.
Mieuli, along with 32 other local investors, was part of a joint venture headed by Diners Club that purchased the Philadelphia Warriors from Eddie Gottlieb for $850,000 and moved the ballclub to the Bay Area following the 1961–62 NBA season. After drawing 5,579 per home game in the prior year, the Warriors fell to the bottom of the league in attendance average with 3,067 in 1962–63, its first season in San Francisco. When Diners Club and other stockholders threatened to bail out from the franchise, Mieuli simply purchased their shares until he eventually became the sole owner.
His 24-year ownership of the Warriors was moderately successful on the court, as the team made the playoffs ten times with three NBA Finals appearances. The first two trips to the championship series resulted in defeats to the Boston Celtics in 1964 and the Philadelphia 76ers in 1967. The third one in 1975 was a four-game sweep of the Washington Bullets and the first time the franchise won the title after its move to the Bay Area. Home attendance was a different story as the Warriors averaged more than 10,000 a game only five times (1976–1979, 1981).
Mieuli played a major role in breaking down racial barriers in the NBA by encouraging his team's front office to sign players regardless of color. Ten of the twelve players on the Warriors' championship roster during the 1975 Finals were African American, as was head coach Al Attles and his assistant Joe Roberts.
Mieuli sold the Warriors to Jim Fitzgerald and Daniel Finnane on May 23, 1986.
Later career.
Until his death in 2010, Mieuli retained a 10% share of the 49ers, an investment that dates back to 1954. In addition to his role with Franklin Mieuli &amp; Associates, which handles broadcast engineering for thirty pro and college sports teams, he was an active member of the San Francisco chapter of Broadcast Legends, and was inducted into the National Television Academy/Northern California Chapter's Gold Circle in 2006, honoring him for his significant contributions to local television during a career spanning more than fifty years.
In 2007, Mieuli was inducted into the Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame as a member of the second class to be honored. He was the recipient of five Super Bowl rings as a part-owner of the 49ers, as well as one NBA Championship trophy as the owner of the Warriors. He died at a hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2010.
His firm, Franklin Mieuli &amp; Associates, continues to produce radio broadcasts for many professional teams in the NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB; as well as NCAA teams.

Maritime simulator

A maritime simulator or ship simulator is a system that simulates ships and maritime environments for training, research and other purposes. Today, simulator training given by maritime schools and academies is part of the basic training of maritime professionals.
At minimum, a maritime simulator consists of a software that realistically simulates the dynamic behavior of a vessel and its systems in a simulated maritime environment and an interface that allows the person using the simulator to control the vessel and interact with its simulated surroundings. In case of so-called full mission bridge simulators, this interface consists of a realistic mock-up of the vessel's bridge and control consoles, and screens or projectors providing up to 360-degree virtual view of the ship's surroundings similar to flight simulators in the aviation industry. Without the real-time visualization, the simulation software can also be used for "fast time" simulations where the vessels are controlled by autopilot. In addition, there are maritime simulators for example for ECDIS, engine room, and cargo handling operations, as well as shore-side operations such as Vessel Traffic Service (VTS).
Maritime simulation games such as "Ship Simulator" and "Virtual Sailor" are also available for home users.

This class derived from its predecessor to be fitted with the QH-50D DASH, the new anti-submarine drone helicopter in return for the removal of the ASROC system. And similarly, it mainly tasked with Anti-submarine warfare. In 1969, after the production of the QH-50D ceased, this class was no longer built and construction of the "Yamagumo"-class resumed.
The JMSDF considered refitting Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System Mk.1 with the Kaman SH-2 Seasprite helicopter in return for the facility of DASH, but this plan was abandoned because of the problem of cost. Finally, the facility of DASH was removed in 1979-82, and Mk.16 GMLS for the ASROC system was fitted.
Murakumo was refitted in 1978 for use as a gun trials ship. Rear Mk.33 gun was removed and a new OTO Melara 76 mm gun was added.

Siege of Jerusalem (poem)

Siege of Jerusalem is the title commonly given to an anonymous Middle English epic poem created in the second half of the 14th century (possibly ca. 1370–1390). The poem is composed in the alliterative manner popular in medieval English poetry, especially during the period known as the "alliterative revival", and is known from nine surviving manuscripts, an uncommonly high number for works of this time.
The siege described in the poem is that of 70 AD. The poem relies on a number of secondary sources—including "Vindicta salvatoris", Roger Argenteuil's "Bible en François", Ranulf Higdon's "Polychronicon", and the "Destruction of Troy"—and on Josephus’ " The Jewish War", which was itself a source for the "Polychronicon". The destruction of Jerusalem is ahistorically portrayed as divinely ordained vengeance by the Romans Vespasian and Titus for the death of Jesus Christ. The poem also describes the tumultuous succession of emperors in Rome in the late 60s, when rulers Nero, Galba, Otho and Vitellius met violent deaths.
Although technically excellent and linguistically interesting, the poem has rarely been presented to students of Middle English verse because of its sadistic indulgence in gory details and extreme anti-Semitic sentiment. This latter aspect of the poem raises important questions regarding the cultural milieu in which it was repeatedly copied and presumably read. Many modern critics have treated the poem with near-contempt due to its excessive descriptions of violence, such as the horrible execution of the Jewish high priests or the cannibalism of her own child by a Jewish woman in the besieged city. Other critics have pointed out that the anonymous poet does not flinch from the horrors of war and does not preach violence against contemporary Jews. 
However, some have argued that the violence against the Jews was not intended to be against the Jews specifically or taken to be commentary on Judaism; any other religious group might as well have been used to the same ends. Identifying the Jews, by such logic, would have been a way of indicating otherness, their role serving as a placeholder for a group different than the initial aggressor. If so, then the violence enacted upon or attributed to them, being at times so unnecessarily graphic and cruel, would have come across, even to an audience at the time so taken with reading about violence, as so unjustified (regardless as to whom it was for or against) as to create pause and encourage reflection on the atrocities committed by the invading Romans.
Synopsis.
The poem begins with the story of Jesus's crucifixion (lines 1-24), as a foreground to the rest of the poem. Then, a fictionalized version of Caesar Nero, who is afflicted with cancer, is introduced (lines 29-36). He summons a fictional merchant, named Nathan, to help cure this disease. Nathan warns Nero that there are no physical cures for his disease, and begins to tell the story of Jesus, about his life, about the Trinity, about the death of Jesus, and about the Veil of Veronica. Following this, the Senators decree that the Jews are responsible for the death of Jesus (lines 269-272), and the Roman army is dispatched to avenge the death of Christ (line 300). When the Romans arrive at Jerusalem, the two armies clash violently, but the Romans prevail, leaving the Jews to retreat into the city and begin the siege (lines 389-636). The Emperor Nero commits suicide in Rome, eventually leaving Vespasian in control (lines 897-964). Vespasian returns to Rome to rule, and a council gives his son Titus control of the Roman armies. It is Titus that leads the Romans for the rest of the siege, capturing the city of Jerusalem, destroying the temple, and slaughtering or selling the rest of the Jews.
Critical issues and interpretations.
Genre.
Critics struggling to assign this poem to a single category tend to treat it as a cross-genre work. Siege of Jerusalem contains elements of a historical narrative (since it is at least in part factually rooted in the siege that felled the Second Temple around 70 A.D.); it is interspersed with hagiography (for its depiction of conversion and adherence to the "Vengeance of Our Lord Tradition"); and has undertones of romance (due to its detailed, exaggerated illustrations of violence and warfare). Such a generic mixture may have augmented the poem's readership at the height of its circulation, since the multitude of contexts, complications, and conventions through which it can be interpreted alerted a broad scope of audiences to its relevance.
Critical reception
Some critical receptions of the poem argue that the extreme depictions of violence against the Jews is meant to show the hypocrisy of the Roman army. Part of the evidence for this reading is the fact that the Romans, except for Vespasian and Titus, are not described as converting to Christianity in the poem. The poem additionally has a flagrant focus on the effects of war. When also considering the absence of the question of conversion in connection with the described deterioration of the Jews, critics have argued that the author of ‘’Siege of Jerusalem’’ was not actually writing with antisemitic intentions, but rather using cultural anxieties about the Jewish other when shaping their narrative into a critique of Roman expansionism.
Dating the composition of the poem.
Currently, there are nine known surviving manuscripts of Siege of Jerusalem, which are called "Manuscript A", "Manuscript C", "Manuscript D", "Manuscript E", "Manuscript Ex", "Manuscript L", "Manuscript P", "Manuscript U", and "Manuscript V". Manuscripts "A", "C", "Ex", "P", and "V" only contain fragments of the poem, whereas Manuscripts "D", "E", "L", and "U" contain copies of the entire poem. None of these manuscripts are considered to be created directly by the original poet, but have helped establish an approximate timeline for when the poem might have been composed. Michael Livingston writes, in his introduction to the poem, about dating the poem's composition. He writes that through analysis of the age of the oldest manuscript, scholars were able to locate a "terminus ad quem", meaning the latest point at which the poem could have been authored, of the late 1390s.

Adempiere

ADempiere is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software package released under a free software license. The verb "adempiere" in Italian means "to fulfill a duty" or "to accomplish".
The software is licensed under the GNU General Public License.
History.
The ADempiere project was created in September 2006. Disagreement between the open-source developer community that formed around the Compiere open-source ERP software and the project's corporate sponsor ultimately led to the creation of Adempiere as a fork of Compiere.
Within weeks of the fork, ADempiere reached the top five of the SourceForge.net rankings. This ranking provides a measure of both the size of its developer community and also its impact on the open-source ERP software market.
The project name comes from the Italian verb "adempiere", which means "fulfillment of a duty" but with the additional senses of "Complete, reach, practice, perform tasks, or release; also, give honor, respect", here which were considered appropriate to what the project aimed to achieve.
Goals of this project.
The goal of the Adempiere project is the creation of a community-developed and supported open source business solution. The Adempiere community follows the open-source model of the Bazaar described in Eric Raymond's article The Cathedral and the Bazaar.
Business functionality.
The following business areas are addressed by the Adempiere application:
Project structure.
All community members are entitled to their say in the project discussion forums. For practical purposes, the project is governed by a council of contributors. A leader is nominated from this council to act as overall project manager. The role of the Adempiere Council is to:
Technology.
Adempiere is developed with Java EE technology, specifically utilizing Apache Tomcat and the JBoss application server. Currently database support is restricted to PostgreSQL and Oracle.
Architecture.
Adempiere inherited the Data Dictionary from the Compiere project. This architecture extends the Data Dictionary concept into the application; thus the application's entities, their validation rules and screen layout can be controlled from within the application itself. In practice, this means that customization of the application can be done without new coding.
A Workflow Management Coalition and Object Management Group standards based workflow engine is utilized to provide Business Process Management. These features allow for the rapid customization of the application to a business's needs.

PP-format

The PP-format (Post Processing Format) is a proprietary file format for meteorological data developed by the Met Office, the United Kingdom's national weather service.
Simulations of the weather are performed by the Met Office's Unified Model, which can be used for Numerical Weather Prediction or Climatology, and data is collected. This data is usually meteorological in nature and may include averaged data for parameters like global surface temperatures or accumulations of rainfall for locations inside the model, though the Unified Model is capable of outputting many sophisticated diagnostics to PP-format. These files are binary streams, structured in a proprietary file format which can then be processed and transformed into other, more portable, formats. The main reason for using such a format is to increase the rate at which data can be written from the model to disk, a major consideration when running a simulation that must be timely and efficient.

Harukaze-class destroyer

The "Harukaze"-class destroyer was the first indigenous post-World War II Japanese destroyer class. Its main mission was anti-submarine warfare. 
Almost all equipment was supplied from the United States according to the U.S. and Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement. Sensor systems on-board was standard equipment in the U.S. Navy at that time, for example, the AN/SPS-6 air-search radar, the AN/SPS-5 surface-search radar, the QHB search sonar, the QDA attack sonar.
Three 5-inch/38 caliber Mark 12 guns were mounted on Mark 30 single mounts, and controlled by a Mark 51 director. The JMSDF wasn't satisfied with performance of the director, so later the Mark 51 was replaced by the Swedish advanced GFCS developed by Contraves ("Harukaze") or American Mark 57 ("Yukikaze"). At the same time, K-guns and depth charge racks were reduced by half and replaced by Mark 32 torpedoes with two Mark 2 over-the-side launchers.

Rational animal

The term rational animal (Latin: "animal rationale" or "animal rationabile") refers to a classical definition of humanity or human nature, associated with Aristotelianism.
History.
While the Latin term itself originates in scholasticism, it reflects the Aristotelian view of man as a creature distinguished by a rational principle. In the "Nicomachean Ethics" I.7, Aristotle states that the human being has a rational principle (Greek: λόγον ἔχον), on top of the nutritive life shared with plants, and the instinctual life shared with other animals, i. e., the ability to carry out rationally formulated projects. That capacity for deliberative imagination was equally singled out as man's defining feature in "De anima" III.11. While seen by Aristotle as a universal human feature, the definition applied to wise and foolish alike, and did not in any way imply necessarily the "making" of rational choices, as opposed to the "ability" to make them.
The Neoplatonic philosopher Porphyry defined man as a "mortal rational animal", and also considered animals to have a (lesser) rationality of their own.
The definition of man as a rational animal was common in scholastical philosophy. Catholic Encyclopedia states that this definition means that "in the system of classification and definition shown in the Arbor Porphyriana, man is a substance, corporeal, living, sentient, and rational".
In Meditation II of "Meditations on First Philosophy", Descartes considers and rejects the scholastic concept of the "rational animal":
Shall I say 'a rational animal'? No; for then I should have to inquire what an animal is, what rationality is, and in this one question would lead me down the slope to other harder ones.
Modern use.
Freud was as aware as any of the irrational forces at work in humankind, but he nevertheless resisted what he called too much "stress on the weakness of the ego in relation to the id and of our rational elements in the faced of the daemonic forces within us".
Neo-Kantian philosopher Ernst Cassirer, in his work "An Essay on Man" (1944), altered Aristotle's definition to label man as a "symbolic animal". This definition has been influential in the field of philosophical anthropology, where it has been reprised by Gilbert Durand, and has been echoed in the naturalist description of man as the compulsive communicator.
Sociologists in the tradition of Max Weber distinguish rational behavior (means-end oriented) from irrational, emotional or confused behavior, as well as from traditional-oriented behavior, but recognise the wide role of all the latter types in human life.
Ethnomethodology sees rational human behavior as representing perhaps one-tenth of the human condition, dependent on the nine-tenths of background assumptions which provide the frame for means-end decision making.
In his "An Outline of Intellectual Rubbish", Bertrand Russell argues against the idea that man is rational, saying "Man is a rational animal — so at least I have been told. Throughout a long life I have looked diligently for evidence in favour of this statement, but so far I have not had the good fortune to come across it."

Norton Fitzwarren railway station

Norton Fitzwarren railway station is an untimetabled station on the West Somerset Railway in Somerset, England. It was built in 2009 about north of the site of the old (Norton Fitzwarren) station that served the village of Norton Fitzwarren from 1873 until 1961. There were fatal railway accidents in the vicinity in 1890, 1940 and 1978.
History.
First station.
The Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&amp;ER) was opened through Norton Fitzwarren on 1 May 1843 but the nearest station was east at . On 31 March 1862 the original West Somerset Railway was opened to , leaving the Exeter line at Norton Junction, but still no station was provided. The first section of the Devon and Somerset Railway to opened on 8 June 1871, making a connection into the West Somerset line just west of the junction with the Exeter line.
The first two-platform station was finally opened at the junction on 1 June 1873, located immediately east of the junction (at ). On the northern platform side closest to the village was a small station building, a hotel and the goods yard. Both the branch lines were operated by the B&amp;ER until 1 January 1876 when it was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway (GWR).
In 1931 the GWR started a project to quadruple the track between Cogload Junction (where the mainline from and the north met the Castle Cary cut-off line from Yeovil, Reading and ), for the south through Taunton to Norton Fitzwarren. The existing station buildings were demolished, to allow a new up-relief line to be built north of the existing northern platform, followed by the creation of a down relief road south of the southern platform. A new metal passenger bridge was erected, connecting the new station buildings to the north with both island platforms. The completion of the project also allowed the GWR to create the large regional goods facility at Fairwater Yard, located just east of the station. The whole project was brought into operation on 2 December 1931.
World War 2: US Army Depot G-50.
At the start of World War II, the Royal Army Service Corps choose the relatively large scale station serving the small community as the ideal location for a new logistics depot. Finished at the end of 1941, it was immediately taken over by the United States Army as part of Operation Bolero in early 1942, one of their 18 supplies depots within the United Kingdom. Redesignated Quartermaster General Depot G-50, they equipped it with extensive railway sidings to the northeast of the railway station.
Part of the reasoning behind the choice of the depot, was that it was one of five within the 18 designated as a US Army Medical Corps supplies depot. Medical supplies were allocated of under cover storage, and a further outside. The US Army also locally developed the 67th General Hospital at Musgrove Park. Both facilities under the control of the US Army Medical Corps came into operation on 1 September 1942.
Closure.
On 1 January 1948 the railways were nationalised and Norton Fitzwarren became a part of the Western Region of British Railways. Passenger traffic was withdrawn on 30 October 1961, after which passengers for the two branches once again had to change trains at Taunton until these routes were closed on 3 October 1966 (the Devon and Somerset line) and 4 January 1971 (West Somerset line). The goods yard continued to operate until 6 July 1964, when the logistics facilities of Norton Manor Camp closed.
The goods facilities had always handled a large volume of locally grown cider apples, and on 1 March 1983 a private siding utilising much of the former up-relief road connection to the WSR was opened into the Taunton Cider Company's factory on the northwest side of the former station site. Although this factory has since closed, it was this private siding that allowed the West Somerset Railway, in its new heritage railway guise, to be connected to the national railway network.
West Somerset Railway.
In 2004 the West Somerset Railway Association (WSRA) — the volunteer organisation that supports the WSR — purchased of land west of its railway and north of the main line at Norton Fitzwarren.
This included a short length of the track bed of the dismantled Barnstaple branch line. This track bed and a new north-west chord have eventually formed a triangle where rolling stock is turned when required. Part of the land is used for ballast reclamation, with waste material being delivered to the site by Network Rail in conjunction with their track renewals depot at nearby Fairwater Yard.
There is also sufficient space to allow for the construction of a locomotive and rolling stock restoration depot in the future.
The WSRA built a single concrete platform on the west side of the Minehead to Taunton line in 2009. This is not shown in the regular timetable but is for use during special events when a shuttle service can bring people from . It is long enough to handle four-coach trains. It was first used on 1 and 2 August 2009 in association with a vintage vehicle rally on the WSR's land at Norton Fitzwarren.
There is currently no public access to the site. This might change as the adjacent 'Ford Farm' site has been identified as a Potential Mixed Use Development site in the Taunton Deane Core Strategy, and an associated transport policy statement that any such development should include improved access to the adjoining West Somerset Railway station.
The WSR entered into a partnership with the modern Great Western Railway (GWR) in 2019 to operate Summer Saturday services between and on Saturdays when special events were taking place. On 3 August, services called additionally at Norton Fitzwarren for the annual Steam Fayre Vintage Rally, run by the WSRA, taking place at the station. These GWR services were the first time the new station was served by trains from the national rail network.
Accidents.
Three significant accidents have happened on the main line in the vicinity of Norton Fitzwarren:

Carole Highlands, Maryland

Carole Highlands is an unincorporated community in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States. It is contained between East West Highway (MD 410) to the south, University Boulevard (MD 193) to the north, Larch Avenue, Hopewell Avenue, and 15th Avenue to the west, and Riggs Road (MD 212) to the east. Carole Highlands borders the adjacent neighborhoods of Chillum, Green Meadows, Lewisdale, and Langley Park in Prince George's County, while bordering the city of Takoma Park in Montgomery County. For statistical purposes, it is part of the Langley Park census-designated place (CDP). The community also has a community association and non-profit: Carole Highlands Neighborhood Association
Physical geography.
Carole Highlands mainly includes single-family houses as well as the Riggs Hill Condominium Complex. Since Carole Highlands is an unincorporated community in Prince George's County, Maryland, Carole Highlands lacks its own neighborhood address and zipcode. As a result, most of the businesses and residences located within Carole Highlands, are assigned Hyattsville addresses, containing the Hyattsville/Adelphi zipcode of 20783 while a few business and residences located on the far western boundary of Carole Highlands, next to the Prince George's County/ Montgomery County Line, are assigned Takoma Park addresses, containing the Takoma Park zipcode of 20912. Carole Highlands was a planned community was named for the developer's daughter, Carole, and because much of it is literally on "high land." At the very top of the neighborhood is a water tower. Elevation above sea level (topo map here) reaches a maximum of at the water tower, and slopes downhill to its minimum of on Elson Street along Sligo Creek Park.
A -high dendritic ridge runs north and south through the neighborhood just west of 16th Place. The ridgeline divides the Sligo Creek watershed from the Northwest Branch watershed. When the leaves are off the trees, from various points on the ridge there is a clear view of the Shepherd Park and Brightwood neighborhoods of Washington, D.C. (3 miles west); of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception (3 miles south-southwest); and of Carmody Hills, Maryland (8 miles southeast).
Roads, hiker-biker trails, and political geography.
Carole Highlands is located within a residential section east of 15th Avenue, northeast of Sligo Creek Park and MD-410 (East-West Highway), west of MD-212 (Riggs Road) and south of MD-193 (University Boulevard).
The only direct road access into the neighborhood is via Erskine Street (from New Hampshire Avenue) or Drexel Street (from Riggs Road).
Elson Street and Sligo Parkway East give Carole Highlands two access points to Sligo Creek Trail, which was designated a National Recreation Trail in 2006 (external link here). The paved and shaded hiker-biker trail links directly to the Anacostia Trail System and thus to the American Discovery Trail that crosses the United States from Delaware to California. However, most Carole Highlands residents use Sligo Creek Trail less frequently as an access point for coast-to-coast tours than for Bicycle commuting, family outings and jogging.
The western boundary of the Carole Highlands neighborhood is the current border between Montgomery County, Maryland and Prince George's County, Maryland, behind the backyards of the houses in Carole Highlands that face 15th Avenue. The section of Carole Highlands consists of single-family houses, starts at the Prince George's County/ Montgomery County Line and ends on East-West Highway (MD 410), the portion of Riggs Road (MD 212) south of Drexel Street, and 17th Avenue. Between portion of Carole Highlands, where Drexel Street/ Erskine Street east of 17th Avenue, and where Riggs Road intersects Drexel Street, north of East-West Highway (MD 410), near University Boulevard (MD 193), is where the "Riggs Hill Condominium Complex, which is the only condominium complex in Carole Highlands, is located.
Plants and animals.
The neighborhood is lined with a canopy of mature trees. For this reason, Carole Highlands appears as a dark green patch on satellite images of the Washington area.
Many of the trees belong to species native to the local ecological region, the Piedmont region of Maryland. Some of the local tree species are oak, maple, birch, beech, elm, cherry, weeping cherry, spruce, pine, sassafras and flowering dogwood.
Mammals: Squirrels, raccoons and opossums are commonly seen and badgers, foxes and deer are seen occasionally.
Some bird species that have been spotted in local backyards are cardinals, titmice, robins, ospreys, crows, woodpeckers, flickers, mockingbirds, wood thrushes, gray catbirds, cowbirds, chickadees, blue jays, mourning doves, towhees, summer tanagers, goldfinches, house and purple finches and the ubiquitous species starling and sparrow. Kingfishers, herons and hawks are seen near Sligo Creek.
History.
The largest section of the neighborhood was developed as a planned community by Carl M. Freeman Associates, Inc. (now the Carl M. Freeman Companies) beginning in 1947. The development maximized the preservation of oak trees hundred of years old by arranging houses on large (6000-12,000 square foot) lots contoured to respect the section's ridges and slopes. According to the company's website (here), the development won an award.
The house styles of the development included traditional two-story "brick colonial" and -story "Dutch colonial" models; the then-new "California Cottage home" designed by Carl Freeman himself as a "truly livable space" with a naturally flowing connection with the outdoors; one-story frame ranch houses and, at the edge of the formal Carole Highlands Section on 17th Avenue, a row of attached (double) family homes. Some of the detached Freeman houses were subsequently enlarged with dormers or one or two-story additions, while others are still in their pristine state to the current day.
In 1960, the neighborhood Citizen's Association successfully brought a legal case against the Board of County Commissioners of Prince George's County. As a result, the court prohibited the building of a gas station on lot C-2.
The portion of Takoma Park located west of 15th Avenue, but east of Prince George's Avenue, Merrimac Drive, and Carroll Avenue, was originally located in Prince George's County, Maryland, from up until July 1, 1997. Earlier in 1997, residents living within the portion of Takoma Park located within Prince George's County, voted affirmatively to unify the City of Takoma Park under the jurisdiction of Montgomery County. The county line was shifted, changing Prince George's County's boundaries for the first time since 1791.
Education.
Primary and secondary schools.
Public schools.
Students from Carole Highlands Section in Prince George's County are currently assigned to Carole Highlands Elementary School—located within the section, Buck Lodge Middle School and High Point High School. Prince George's County Public Schools.

Places of Worship.
In 2003, the Turner Memorial AME congregation purchased the large church building within the section from the Wallace Memorial Presbyterian congregation that formerly occupied its multiple lots. Two Protestant and one Roman Catholic churches are located within easy walking distance on near-by New Hampshire Avenue.
Public libraries.
The closest public library to Carole Highlands is the Takoma Park Library. This library is at Philadelphia and Maple Avenues, about one and a half miles west of Carole Highlands via bicycle paths and residential streets. The Takoma Park Library is a department of the City of Takoma Park, and is the only independent (not county-run) municipal library in the state of Maryland. It has a children's book room, an adults' book room and a periodicals reading area. Residents of the City of Takoma Park automatically have borrowing privileges, and Prince George's County residents may obtain full borrowing privileges for an annual fee of $10.
The second closest public library to Carole Highlands is the Hyattsville Library. This library is on Adelphi Road to the east of the Prince George's Plaza shopping mall, about two miles (3 km) east of Carole Highlands via MD-212 and MD-410. It has a children's book room, an adults' book room, a computer area and a periodicals reading area. The Hyattsville Library is also the site of the Maryland Room, decorated in the style of a parlor in a Colonial manor house of the 18th century and housing a historical and genealogical collection that focuses on Maryland.

Oyster bar

An oyster bar, also known as an oyster saloon, oyster house or a raw bar service, is a restaurant specializing in serving oysters, or a section of a restaurant which serves oysters buffet-style. Oysters have been consumed since ancient times and were common tavern food in Europe, but the oyster bar as a distinct restaurant began making an appearance in the 18th century.
History.
Oyster consumption in Europe was confined to the wealthy until the mid-17th century but, by the 18th century, the poor were also consuming them. Sources vary as to when the first oyster bar was created. One source claims that Sinclair's, a pub in Manchester, England, is the United Kingdom's oldest oyster bar. It opened in 1738. London's oldest restaurant, Rules, also began business as an oyster bar. It opened in 1798.
In North America, Native Americans on both coasts ate oysters in large quantities, as did colonists from Europe. Unlike in Europe, oyster consumption in North America after colonization by Europeans was never confined to class, and oysters were commonly served in taverns. During the early 19th century, express wagons filled with oysters crossed the Allegheny Mountains to reach the American Midwest. The oldest oyster bar in the United States is Union Oyster House in Boston, which opened in 1826. It features oyster shucking in front of the customer, and patrons may make their own oyster sauces from condiments on the tables. It has served as a model for many oyster bars in the United States.
During the same period, oysters were an integral part of some African-American communities. One example is Sandy Ground, which was located in modern-day Rossville, Staten Island. African-Americans were drawn to the oyster industry because it promised autonomy, as they were involved throughout the process of harvesting and selling. In addition, oyster farmers were relatively less impoverished than slaves and did not work under white owners. A recipe for an oyster pie in Abby Fisher's 1881 cookbook, "What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking", suggests the influence of oysters on African-American foodways and culture. 
By 1850, nearly every major town in North America had an oyster bar, oyster cellar, oyster parlor, or oyster saloon—almost always located in the basement of the establishment (where keeping ice was easier). Oysters and bars often went hand-in-hand in the United States, because oysters were seen as a cheap food to serve alongside beer and liquor.
By the late 1880s, an "oyster craze" had swept the United States, and oyster bars were prominent gathering places in Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Denver, Louisville, New York City, and St. Louis. An 1881 U.S. government fisheries study counted 379 oyster houses in the Philadelphia city directory alone, a figure explicitly not including oyster consumption at hotels or other saloons. In 1892, the "Pittsburgh Dispatch" estimated the annual consumption (in terms of individual oysters) for London at one billion, and the United States as a whole at twelve billion oysters.
This enormous demand for oysters was not sustainable. The beds of the Chesapeake Bay, which supplied much of the American Midwest, were becoming rapidly depleted by the early 1890s. Increasing restrictions on oystering seasons and methods in the late 19th century led to the rise of oyster pirates, culminating in the Oyster Wars of the Chesapeake Bay, that pitted poachers against armed law enforcement authorities of Virginia and Maryland (dubbed the "oyster navy").
According to "The New York Times" in 2014, about 90 percent of oyster bar sales in the United States come from farmed (not wild) oysters.

Honda Capa

The Honda Capa, short for "capacity", is a tall wagon produced by Honda between 1998 and 2002 for the Japanese market. It was introduced at the 1997 Tokyo Motor Show as the concept car "J-MW." It went on sale on April 24, 1998, with Honda series codes GA4 and GA6. On September 16, 1999 a four-wheel drive version of the Capa was released, using Honda's Full-Time 4wd system. Brake Assist was offered as standard equipment. Due to disappointing sales, the Capa nameplate was discontinued in 2002. It was available in Japan through the Honda Primo and Honda Verno dealerships.
General information.
The Honda Capa was developed on the Honda Logo platform and is the first generation of the J Mover series. Its concept was based on a 'Small is Smart' way of thinking. Ease of use in everyday life, compactness, lightness and friendliness to the environment were some of the criteria built into the design. The proposal was that the Capa was to be 'joyful' however this translates better as 'fun'. It was one class larger than the kei-sized Honda Life, but smaller than the compact sized, Honda CR-V which based on the Honda Civic platform, and reflected the growing popularity of MPV/SUV/minivan vehicles.
The Honda Capa was designed with the intention of creating a car that was to be the best size for town driving. A car that could seat your family, with ample height for headroom and plenty of legroom considering its compact nature. To achieve this feat, Honda design the chassis based on a 'dual deck package.'
The Honda Capa was equipped with a 1.5-litre, single-overhead-cam, four-valve inline four-cylinder D15B engine. It was initially offered only with Honda's Multimatic continuously variable transmission (CVT), but following an update, a regular four-speed automatic transmission option was introduced as a lower cost option on front-wheel-drive versions.
Interior.
The interior design incorporated a gray color scheme, with seat and door armrest upholstery available in blue or beige tones. The C grade featured jersey fabric, while the D grade used double-raschel fabric. Climate control was standard, offering an automatic air conditioner for the D grade and a manual one for the C grade.
Origin of the name.
Honda named the Capa based on the English word 'Capacity', referring to ability as well as spaciousness.

Ononis rotundifolia

Ononis rotundifolia, commonly known as round-leaved restharrow, is a perennial shrub belonging to the genus "Ononis" of the family Fabaceae.
Description.
"Ononis rotundifolia" reaches on average of height, with a maximum of . The stem and the leaves are slightly hairy and sticky. The leaves are composed of three irregularly toothed and almost rounded leaflets (hence the specific Latin name "rotundifolia"), the median one with a long petiole.

The Honda Zest is a kei car released in 2006 by Honda. It is mechanically identical to the fifth-generation Honda Life. Equipped with a turbocharged engine, 3 cylinders, and 4 doors, it was the first kei car available with optional side curtain airbags. It was available in two distinct versions — Zest and Zest Sports. During the fall/winter 2008, the Zest Sports was replaced with the Zest Spark. Honda enlisted J-Pop mega-star Ayumi Hamasaki ("Ayu") to promote the Zest Spark with a special (dealer installed) "A Style Package" edition. The Ayu x Zest Spark collaboration replaced the "A" in the Spark logo with Ayu's stylized "A" and also included a dashboard garnish and a revised front grille.

Guzmán competed as Miss Miranda in Miss Venezuela 2001 (and the preceding Miss World Venezuela 2001) without success. The altered schedule of the Miss World 2006 pageant forced the Miss Venezuela Organization to prepare an "emergency pageant" to select a candidate. She proceeded to compete for the title of Miss World 2006 on the night of September 30, 2006, in the Americas group but failed to make the final cut. The winner of Miss World Americas 2006 title was Miss Brazil.

Ayanami-class destroyer

The "Ayanami" class was a destroyer class built for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) in the late 1950s. The primary purpose was anti-submarine warfare, so this class was classified as "DDK" (hunter-killer anti-submarine destroyer) unofficially.
Design.
This class adopted a "long forecastle" design with inclined afterdeck called , named after the scenic sloping street in Nagasaki City. Their steam turbine propulsion systems were similar to the ones of the , but they varied between each ship in the class as part of the JMSDF's attempt to find the best propulsion system for its future surface combatants.
The "Ayanami" class were the first JMSDF vessels equipped with six 3-inch/50 caliber Mark 22 guns with Mark 33 dual mounts and Mark 32 lightweight torpedoes with two Mark 2 over-the-side launchers. 3-inch guns were controlled by two Mark 63 GFCSs.
All seven vessels names had previously been borne by ships of the World War II-era and classes.

Kliros

The kliros (Greek: κλῆρος "klēros", plural κλῆροι "klēroi"; Slavonic: клиросъ, "kliros" or sometimes крилосъ, "krilos") is the section of an Eastern Orthodox, Armenian, or Eastern Catholic church dedicated to the choir. It refers both to the general space in which chanters or singers assemble for the services, as well as to the actual music stand or shelves on which music is stored and read.
Overview.
The name derives from the Greek word for "lot", since originally those who read and sang were chosen by lot.
Historically, in cathedrals, monasteries and larger establishments such as chapels belonging to seminaries and major parishes, there would have been kliroi on both right and left sides of the church. The result is two choirs which sing antiphonally, much as monastic and cathedral choirs of the Western Churches still have today. This was the practice in the Byzantine Imperial Cathedral of Hagia Sophia, in Constantinople, whose historical liturgical practice became the standard for all churches following the Byzantine liturgical tradition.
This arrangement presupposes a number of singers on each side, adding up to a reasonably large total, and two highly trained chanters skilled in leading the services. Unfortunately, highly trained chanters are exceedingly rare today, and most churches have only the one kliros, often to the right of the iconostasis. Nevertheless, some patriarchal cathedrals, larger monastic communities, seminaries, and places with sufficient resources and singers, may continue to have two kliroi.
The Russian Orthodox Church will often have, in addition to a kliros by the iconostasis, a choir loft above the great doors of the west entrance of the church.
In churches of the Greek and some parts of the Russian tradition, chanters and men who sing at the kliros will often wear a black riassa (outer-cassock). 
In the Armenian tradition, all members of the choir at the kliros wear a stikharion (robe made out of fine material).

SS Kurtuluş

SS "Kurtuluş" was a Turkish cargo ship which became famous for her humanitarian role in carrying food aid during the famine Greece suffered under the Axis occupation in World War II. She sank on 20 February 1942 in the Sea of Marmara during her fifth voyage from Istanbul, Turkey to Piraeus, Greece. In Turkish, "kurtuluş" means "liberation".
History of the ship.
The steamer "Kurtuluş" was built by Caird &amp; Purdie Shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England in 1883. She was a dry-freight carrier, long with 2,735 gross register tons capacity. After having served under different flags and names, she was purchased in 1924 by the prominent Turkish shipowning family, Kalkavan brothers. 
She served as freighter in Turkish waters as one of the first ships under the flag of the newly established Turkish Republic. She was re-sold in 1934 to another family active in the same field, Tavilzade brothers, who named her "SS "Kurtuluş"" ("SS Liberation") in 1934. In 1941, SS "Kurtuluş" was leased by the Turkish government for humanitarian relief to be provided during the food crisis in Greece.
Mission and aftermath.
Greece experienced the Great Famine () during the time the country was occupied by Nazi Germany starting April 1941, and blockaded by the Royal Navy. Today the famine is generally believed to have caused the deaths of around 300,000 people of all ages, according to historian and researcher Mark Mazower. 
The National Greek War Relief Association, an organization formed in October 1940 by the Greek Orthodox Church, started to raise funds in the United States and to organize relief efforts to supply the population with food and medicine. The Allied high command were initially reluctant to lift the blockade since it was the only form of pressure they had on the Axis Powers. However, a compromise was reached to allow shipments of grain to come from the neutral Turkey, despite the fact that it was within the blockade zone.
Turkish president İsmet İnönü with the Turkish parliament and his government, signed a decision and initiated a mission to help the people whose army he had personally clashed &amp; fought with during the Turkish War of Independence 19 years prior. Turkey thus became the first to lend a helping hand to Greece officially, with a significant amount of support from several other organizations. Foodstuffs were collected by a nationwide campaign of Kızılay (Turkish Red Crescent) and the operation was mainly funded by the "American Greek War Relief Association" and the "Hellenic Union of Constantinopolitans". Food supplies were sent to the port of Istanbul to be shipped to Greece. SS "Kurtuluş" was prepared for her voyage with big symbols of the Red Crescent painted on both sides.
After having received permission from London to cross the blockade zone, the ship left Karaköy Pier on 6 October 1941 for the first time. Upon landing in Piraeus, the port city near Athens, the International Red Cross took charge of unloading and of distributing the foodstuffs. In the following months, SS "Kurtuluş" made three more voyages to Greece delivering a total of 6,735 tons of food aid.
Sinking and fate.
During her fifth voyage, after having left Istanbul on 18 February, the old ship was caught in heavy weather and rough seas in the Sea of Marmara. During the stormy night of 20 February 1942, SS "Kurtuluş" was blown onto rocks off the coast near Saraylar village, north of Marmara Island. She sank the next morning at 9:15 after the accident. All 34 crew members reached Marmara Island. The place was later named Cape Kurtuluş in her memory.
Despite the loss of SS "Kurtuluş", Turkey maintained her determination to help, and continued sending aid until 1946 with other ships like SS "Dumlupınar", SS "Tunç", SS "Konya", SS "Güneysu" and SS "Aksu". One ship, the SS "Dumlupınar" brought around 1,000 sick Greek children aged 13–16 to Istanbul to recuperate in a safe place.
The documentary film.
Turkish writer-researcher &amp; film director Erhan Cerrahoğlu undertook research work to produce a documentary on SS "Kurtuluş" and on the relief campaign the ship was part of. The wrecksite was identified in summer 2005, by diver Professor Erdoğan Okuş and his team. The shipwreck was found mostly demolished, and many of the wreckage parts were scattered across the sea-floor.
The documentary film "Barışı Taşıyan Vapur: Kurtuluş" () features images seen for the first time. The documentary debuted on 1 June 2006, during the 3rd International Istanbul Bunker Conference.

Porto Vivo

"Porto Vivo", literally translating to "Porto Alive", is the name for an urban rejuvenation project in Porto, Portugal. The Porto City Council, ("Camara municipal") established this project when the City old Town was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO during 1998.
History.
Porto City Council's officially appointed body, The Society of Urban Rehabilitation of Oporto, was created specifically to take charge of and carry out this project. They are located in the Sé district of Porto, on Rua Mouzinho da Silveira, in the heart of the protection zone. The society was constituted on 27 of November 2004. Its mission is to elaborate the strategy, and promote the program of urban rejuvenation in Porto, by acting as mediator between property owners and investors, between holders and tenants, and where needed, to take charge the operation of urban rehabilitation, using the lawful powers conferred to it by the City Council.
The overall aim of the rehabilitation program is to rehabitate, and breathe new life into the inner city (The "Baixa" district), and the historical centre of Porto. This involves renovation of much of the older, more neglected residential and other historically significant buildings, especially in the area bounded by the ancient city walls, defined by UNESCO as being a world heritage conservation zone during 1996.
Objectives.
The society has 5 declared objectives:
In addition to the many historical buildings renovated to date as part of Porto Vivo, the program has also yielded the Porto Metro, the upgrading &amp; expansion of Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport, the construction of many new buildings including the Casa da Música theatre, the Infante Dom Henrique Bridge, and the upgrading of the Dom Luis I Bridge.

Modern Greek phonology

This article deals with the phonology and phonetics of Standard Modern Greek. For phonological characteristics of other varieties, see varieties of Modern Greek, and for Cypriot, specifically, see .
Consonants.
Greek linguists do not agree on which consonants to count as phonemes in their own right, and which to count as conditional allophones. The table below is adapted from , who considers the palatals and both affricates, and , to be allophonic.
The alveolar nasal is assimilated to following obstruents; it can be labiodental (e.g. 'doubt'), dental (e.g. 'flower'), retracted alveolar (e.g. 'pliers'), alveolo-palatal (e.g. 'to annoy'), or velar (e.g. 'stress').
Voiceless stops are unaspirated and with a very short voice onset time. They may be lightly voiced in rapid speech, especially when intervocalic. 's exact place of articulation ranges from alveolar to denti-alveolar, to dental. It may be fricated in rapid speech, and very rarely, in function words, it is deleted. and are reduced to lesser degrees in rapid speech.
Voiced stops are prenasalised (which is reflected in the orthography) to varying extents, and sometimes not at all. The nasal component—when present—does not increase the duration of the stop's closure; as such, prenasalised voiced stops would be most accurately transcribed or , depending on the length of the nasal component. Word-initially and after or , they are very rarely, if ever, prenasalised. In rapid and casual speech, prenasalisation is generally rarer, and voiced stops may be lenited to fricatives. That also accounts for Greeks having trouble disambiguating voiced stops, nasalised voiced stops, and nasalised voiceless stops in borrowings and names from foreign languages such as, "d", "nd", and "nt", which are all written ντ in Greek.
 and are somewhat retracted (); they are produced in between English alveolars and postalveolars . is variably fronted or further retracted depending on environment, and, in some cases, it may be better described as an advanced postalveolar ().
The only Greek rhotic is prototypically an alveolar tap , often retracted (). It may be an alveolar approximant intervocalically, and is usually a trill in clusters, with two or three short cycles.
Greek has palatals which are allophones of the velar consonants before the front vowels . The velars also merge with a following nonsyllabic to the corresponding palatal before the vowels , e.g. (= ) 'snow', thus producing a surface contrast between palatal and velar consonants before . and occur as allophones of and , respectively, in (consonant–glide–vowel) clusters, in analyses that posit an archiphoneme-like glide that contrasts with the vowel . All palatals may be analysed in the same way. The palatal stops and fricatives are somewhat retracted, and and are somewhat fronted. is best described as a postalveolar, and as alveolo-palatal.
Finally, Greek has two phonetically affricate clusters, and . is reluctant to treat these as phonemes on the grounds of inconclusive research into their phonological behaviour.
The table below, adapted from , displays a near-full array of consonant phones in Standard Modern Greek.
Sandhi.
Some assimilatory processes mentioned above also occur across word boundaries. In particular, this goes for a number of grammatical words ending in , most notably the negation particles and and the accusative forms of the personal pronoun and definite article and . If these words are followed by a voiceless stop, either assimilates for place of articulation to the stop, or is altogether deleted, and the stop - in both circumstances - becomes voiced. This results in pronunciations such as ('the father' ) or ('it doesn't matter'), instead of and . The precise extent of assimilation may vary according to dialect, speed and formality of speech. This may be compared with pervasive sandhi phenomena in Celtic languages, particularly nasalisation in Irish and in certain dialects of Scottish Gaelic.
Vowels.
Greek has a system of five vowels . The first two are close to the cardinal vowels ; the mid vowels are true-mid ; and the open is near-open central .
There is no phonemic length distinction, but vowels in stressed syllables are pronounced somewhat longer than in unstressed syllables. Furthermore, vowels in stressed syllables are more peripheral, but the difference is not large. In casual speech, unstressed and in the vicinity of voiceless consonants may become devoiced or even elided.
Some falling diphthongs exist as well, e.g. 's/he listens', 'donkey', 'strawberry'.
Stress.
Unlike Ancient Greek, which had a pitch accent system, Modern Greek has variable (phonologically unpredictable) stress. Every multisyllabic word carries stress on one of its three final syllables. Enclitics form a single phonological word together with the host word to which they attach, and count towards the three-syllable rule. When an enclitic attaches to a word with stress on the third-to-last syllable, that stress becomes secondary, and the primary stress shifts to the second-last syllable (e.g. 'my car'). Phonetically, stressed syllables are longer, or carry higher amplitude, or both.
The position of the stress can vary between different inflectional forms of the same word within its inflectional paradigm. In some paradigms, the stress is always on the third-last syllable, shifting its position in those forms that have longer affixes (e.g. 'I called' vs. 'we called'; 'problem' vs. 'problems'). In some word classes, stress position also preserves an older pattern inherited from Ancient Greek according to which a word could not be accented on the third-last syllable if the vowel in the last syllable was long, e.g. ('man', nominative singular, last vowel short), but ('of men', genitive plural, last vowel long). However, in Modern Greek this rule is no longer automatic and does not apply to all words (e.g. 'monk', 'of monks'), as the phonological vowel length distinction itself no longer exists.

Parley P. Christensen

Parley Parker Christensen (July 19, 1869 – February 10, 1954) was an American attorney and politician who was a Utah state representative, a Los Angeles City Council member, and the Farmer–Labor Party's presidential nominee during the 1920 presidential election. He was a member of several third parties and chairman of the Illinois Progressive party.
Early life.
Christensen was born on July 19, 1869, in Weston, Idaho, to Peter and Sophia M. Christensen, and was taken by them to Newton, Utah. In 1890 he graduated from the University of Utah Normal School and University of Deseret, then became a teacher and principal in Murray and Grantsville, Utah. In 1897, he graduated from Cornell University Law School and practiced law in Salt Lake City.
Early political career.
From 1892 to 1895, he was superintendent of schools in Tooele County, Utah. In 1895 he was secretary of the Utah constitutional convention that drafted a state constitution for submission to Congress. In the late 1890s he was city attorney of Grantsville, and in 1900 he was elected county attorney of Salt Lake County. Between 1900 and 1904 Christensen was a Republican state officer, including party chairman. In 1902 he was defeated for renomination as county attorney, but in 1904 he was elected again to that office. Christensen unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Congress in 1906, 1908, and 1910 against incumbent Joseph Howell.
From 1901 to 1906 he was prosecuting attorney for Salt Lake County. In 1906 he was cited to appear before a district court judge to show why he had not approved the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of Joseph F. Smith, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, "on a charge of sustaining unlawful relations with one of his five wives. From 1910 to 1912 he was a member of the Utah House of Representatives as a Republican. In the latter year, Christensen joined Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party and ran as the Progressive candidate for the Utah House of Representatives. He lost, but two years later he was elected to that office as a Progressive; he served one term. He supported a number of reforms.
Between 1915 and 1920, Christensen became "increasingly involved with various left-wing and labor groups" in Utah. He helped organize the Utah Labor Party in 1919, defended several radicals incarcerated at Fort Douglas, Utah, charged with opposition to American involvement in World War I. He was president of the Popular Government League, organized in 1916, which argued for adopting the initiative and referendum in Utah.
Presidential campaign.
In June 1920, Christensen was a delegate to the Chicago joint conventions of the Labor Party of the United States and the progressive Committee of Forty-Eight, whose leaders hoped to merge and to nominate a presidential ticket. The Farmer-Labor Party was the result, with Christensen as presidential nominee. He campaigned for nationalization of railroads and utilities, an eight-hour working day, a federal Department of Education, and an end to the Espionage and Sedition Acts. In the election, he received 265,411 votes in nineteen states. Christensen did the best in Washington and in South Dakota, where he came close to out-polling the Democratic candidate, James M. Cox.
Later life.
He remained in Chicago after the convention and became chairman of the Illinois Progressive Party and its unsuccessful candidate for US Senator in 1926.
In 1931 Christensen moved to Los Angeles, California, where he was elected to the city council in 1935. He joined the End Poverty in California crusade of Upton Sinclair and the Utopian Society. Christensen had the endorsement of the End Poverty in California movement when he won the Los Angeles City Council District 9 seat in 1935 from the incumbent, George W. C. Baker. He held the seat for two years but did not run for re-election in 1937. Two years later, however, he was sent back to the council and held the post until 1949, when he was defeated by Edward R. Roybal. In the first years of his tenure, the 9th District covered the core of downtown Los Angeles, but later, it was shifted eastward to encompass an area with a heavily Hispanic population.
In 1936, Christensen ran for Congress against incumbent Democrat Charles Kramer, but was defeated in the primary 57% to 30%.
Death.
Christensen died at age 84 on February 9, 1954, in Queen of Angels Hospital, Los Angeles.

Patent portfolio

A patent portfolio is a collection of patents owned by a single entity, such as an individual or corporation. The patents may be related or unrelated. Patent applications may also be regarded as included in a patent portfolio.
The monetary benefits of a patent portfolio include a market monopoly position for the portfolio holder and revenue from licensing the intellectual property. Non-monetary benefits include strategic advantages like first-mover advantages and defense against rival portfolio holders. Constituting a patent portfolio may also be used to encourage investment.
Because patents have a fixed lifespan (term of patent), elements of a portfolio of patents constantly expire and enter the public domain.
Market value and evaluation.
The value of a corporation's patent portfolio can be a significant fraction of the overall value of the corporation. Ocean Tomo LLC, for example, maintains an index of corporations whose market value is governed in large part by their patent portfolio value. The index is called "Ocean Tomo 300 Patent Index".
Another example is "IPscore"—acquired in 2006 by the European Patent Office—a software application, developed by the Danish Patent and Trademark Office. The application estimates "the economic value of patents and development projects".
Patent portfolio valuation.
Because patent portfolios can contain hundreds, sometimes thousands, of patents, companies that wish to license a patent portfolio often must negotiate without complete information. In many cases, it is too costly for the negotiating parties to assess the validity and value of each of the portfolio's individual patents. Instead, parties will attempt to set a royalty that, over time, "converges on an objective probabilistic assessment of the portfolio's value."

Emil M. Mrak

Emil Marcel Mrak (October 27, 1901 – April 9, 1987) was an American food scientist, microbiologist, and second chancellor of the University of California, Davis. He was recognized internationally for his work in food preservation and as a world authority on the biology of yeasts.
Biography.
Early years.
Mrak was born in San Francisco, California to a Croatian family, but did not grow up in that city. Instead, he was raised in the rural orchards of the Santa Clara Valley. He graduated from Campbell High School in Campbell, then went on to receive a B.S. degree in Food Technology in 1926, M.S. degree in 1928, and Ph.D. degree in botany and mycology in 1936 from the University of California, Berkeley. While an undergraduate at Berkeley, Mrak was a member of the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity.
Career.
Mrak was appointed as an instructor in food technology at UC Berkeley in 1937 and became professor and department chairman in 1948. In 1951, he led the move of the department to its current location at UC Davis, and was later appointed chancellor in 1959. He was the first food scientist to ever be named president or chancellor of a college or university. The only other food scientist to have this honor is James L. Oblinger, chancellor of the North Carolina State University in Raleigh from 2005 to 2009.
Mrak was recommended to UC President Clark Kerr by Harry R. Wellman. Kerr had to bring Mrak before the board three times in order to secure their reluctant approval of his appointment to lead the Davis campus. Upon encountering him, some regents initially thought that Mrak did not "look like a chancellor". However, both the Board of Regents and Kerr came to value Mrak's management skills, as well as his ability to effectively represent the university's interests in nearby Sacramento.
At the time of Mrak's appointment, Davis was still tightly focused on agriculture due to its origins as the University Farm. Mrak successfully developed UC Davis into a general campus offering a rich variety of undergraduate and graduate programs, and he worked hard to turn the campus into a bicycle-friendly environment.
A charter member of the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) in 1939, Mrak served as its President from 1957 to 1958. He also won numerous awards within IFT, including the Nicholas Appert Award (1957), the Babcock-Hart Award (1961), the International Award (1963), election as a Fellow in 1970, and the Carl R. Fellers Award in 1984. He also served as chair of IFT's Northern California Section in 1947/48. In 1969, Mrak served as chairman of a federal government commission (which became known as the Mrak commission) that recommended restricting the use of the pesticide DDT. He also served as the first chairman of the Environmental Protection Agency's Science Advisory Council under President Richard M. Nixon.
Personal life.
Mrak married Vera Dudley Greaves, a nutritionist, on November 15, 1945. They had two children: Robert Emil Mrak (December 18, 1948) and Antoinette Vera Mrak (July 15, 1951). Mrak died in Davis, California on April 9, 1987. Mrak Hall, the administration office building on the UC Davis campus, is named in his honor. 
In 1988, UC Davis also established the Emil M. Mrak International Award in his honor.

Yahudi

Yahudi () is a 1958 Hindi-language epic romantic historical drama film directed by Bimal Roy. It stars Dilip Kumar, Meena Kumari, Sohrab Modi, Nazir Hussain, Nigar Sultana among others. It is based on the play "Yahudi Ki Ladki" by Agha Hashar Kashmiri, a classic in Parsi-Urdu theatre, about persecution of Jews in the Roman Empire in the empire's centre — Rome. Although not very well received critically, the film was a big hit despite its alien theme, and was the third-highest grossing Indian film of 1958, owing to the box office draw of Dilip Kumar and Meena Kumari.
The film's lyricist Shailendra won the Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist at the 6th Filmfare Awards, for the song "Yeh Mera Diwanapan Hai", sung by Mukesh.
The plot bears similarities to Jacques Fromental Halévy's opera La Juive. The story revolves around the life of a foster relationship.
Plot.
Ezra (Sohrab Modi) is a jeweller who has a son named Elijah. He also has a friendly butler/childminder called Emmanuel. At the beginning of the film, Ezra is due to leave on a trip. As he does, Elijah becomes upset and stands on the balcony. On the roads of the Jewish quarter, Brutus (Nazir Hussain), Governor of Rome, is passing, making an announcement. A stone slips from Elijah's hand on the balcony and hits Brutus on the head. Brutus immediately gets Elijah arrested, and as Elijah is a Jew, sentences him to death. Hearing this, Ezra rapidly returns and arrives at the doorstep of Brutus. He begs Brutus to free Elijah, but Brutus feeds Elijah to hungry lions. Ezra sadly returns to his house and mourns his son. Emmanuel sees that his master is almost catatonic. In revenge, Emmanuel kidnaps Lydia, motherless daughter of Brutus, and takes her to Ezra. Ezra snaps out of his catatonic state when the girl starts to call him father, and he refuses to kill her and instead adopts her as his child.
Brutus' anger brews. He orders the guards to find his daughter, and call for punishment of all Jews. Emmanuel helps him and Lydia escape the guards, who eventually break down the front door -- after which he tells them a tale about how he murdered Lydia and fed her to stray dogs, to which the enraged guards react by killing him. Ezra remains hidden and raises Lydia, who grows up thinking she is Ezra's daughter and that her name is Hannah.
Fifteen years pass and Ezra grows to become a successful jeweller, well known to be so good and a Jew. Hannah (Meena Kumari) grows into a beautiful young lady and attracts attention from many. The Emperor of Rome arrives in Rome for the marriage of his son Prince Marcus (Dilip Kumar) to Brutus' niece Princess Octivia (Nigar Sultana).
However, Prince Marcus avoids talking about his wedding and opposes it. One day, when returning from a hunting trip, he is injured and is cared for by Hannah. He then disguises himself as a Jew and goes back into the Jewish neighbourhood. He rescues Hannah from the unwanted attentions of a Roman soldier and meets her father, Ezra, not as Prince Marcus but as Moshe, a successful Jew from Alexandria. Ezra is happy to meet him and "Moshe" and Hannah fall in love. However, Hannah soon notices that something isn't right. Prince Marcus then reveals who he is, making Hannah very upset at his dishonesty, and she banishes the Prince from her life.
Then comes the day of the wedding of Prince Marcus and Princess Octivia. Everyone is invited. Before the ritual could commence, Hannah shouts that she had been cheated by a Roman. Ezra joins in to get back at his enemy Brutus. He clamours for justice. The Emperor demands the name of the culprit and Hannah claims it is Prince Marcus. Brutus tries to rebut Hannah and Ezra, but the Emperor insists that justice must be done. Heartbroken, Hannah returns home.
She is followed by Princess Octivia. Hannah sees the Princess at her doorstep and denies her entry. Hannah knew the princess would beg for the Prince's life. However, the princess tells Hannah that the Prince will be sentenced to death the very next day. Early the next day, without warning, Hannah takes Ezra with her to the Emperor. There she recants her accusation of the prince. She tells the Emperor that the man that cheated was not the prince but a look-alike. Ezra is shocked, and Brutus, filled with joy, sentences Hannah and Ezra to death. They are to be thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil that very day, in front of the Prince. Unable to bear that his beloved will be burnt in front of him, Prince Marcus blinds himself, then goes to the cauldron chamber.
Ezra is begging for Hannah's life, and Hannah is trying to reason with Ezra that she'd rather die than live a life of hate. But Brutus stops at nothing and wants the two to die. Immediately, Ezra tells Brutus that he knows where the Governor's lost daughter is. Brutus is confused and says that this is Ezra's revenge and accuses the Jew of lying. Ezra sarcastically agrees. Brutus still begs Ezra for his daughter's whereabouts and Ezra will only reveal it on one condition: Hannah is to be thrown into the cauldron as soon as Brutus finds out who his daughter is. Ezra tells Brutus and the confused Hannah that Hannah is Brutus' daughter and the Jew tells the guards to throw Hannah into the boiling oil. Brutus orders them to stop. Ezra looks at Hannah and dies. Hannah cries over her foster father's dead body. Brutus tells Hannah not to cry, but Hannah does not listen. She runs away from Brutus looking for the Prince. Shocked to find him blind, Hannah lends him support and helps him as the two disappear into the distance.

<doc id="6904083" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6904083" title="Culture of Martinique">
Culture of Martinique

 
As an overseas department of France, Martinique's culture is French, African, Indian and Caribbean. Its former capital, Saint-Pierre (destroyed by a volcanic eruption), was often referred to as the Paris of the Lesser Antilles. The official language is French, although many Martinicans speak a Creole patois. Based in French, Martinique's Creole also incorporates elements of English, Spanish, Portuguese, and African languages. Originally passed down through oral storytelling traditions, it continues to be used more often in speech than in writing.
Most of Martinique's population is descended from African slaves brought to work on sugar plantations during the colonial era, white slave owners or from Carib or Kalinago people. 
Today, the island enjoys a higher standard of living than most other Caribbean countries. French products are easily available. Following French custom, many businesses close at midday, then reopen later in the afternoon. Among young people, studying in France is common. For the French, Martinique has been a vacation hotspot for many years, attracting both the upper class and more budget-conscious travelers.
Music.
Music contributes a great deal to Martinique's culture. The most popular style is zouk, which originated in Martinique and Guadeloupe by combining elements of a number of musical styles from the Caribbean and United States. Its biggest influence was biguine, which was popular dance orchestra music from the 1930s to 1950s. Zouk today has evolved from big band ensembles to smaller, electronically peppered bands. Musicians use synthesizers, DIGITAL samplers, and drum machines, which they program to sound like native percussion instruments.
Another favorite musical genre, bèlè is an early form of biguine which incorporates group dance and song accompanied by drumming, often led in a call and response style. For most of the year, local music dominates. But during Carnival, other music like calypso and soca can be heard as well.
Festivals.
Martinique's version of Carnival, is a four-day event beginning just before Lent and ending on its first day, with the burning of Vaval, a papier-mâché figure symbolizing Carnival. Businesses close during Carnival.
Like other Caribbean Carnivals, Martinique's is a high-energy event with parades, singing, drums, and other festivities. People dress up in costumes, with devils and she-devils being especially popular. During Carnival in Martinique, many men parade in drag queen costume, sometimes with very elaborate and provocative outfits, with no obvious hint at alternative sexuality. It must be mentioned that traditionally, some women dressed as men for burlesque weddings on Monday. The high presence of men in drag is a reference to the central role of women in Martinique's society and family structure.
Towns throughout Martinique elect their own Carnival Queen, Mini-Queen, and Queen Mother.
Halfway through Lent, Martinicans take a break from abstinence with the one-day holiday Micarême. The one-day mini-Carnival features dances, parties, and similar activities. Afterward, people return to their repentance until Easter begins.
Just as in France, every year on November 21, Martinique celebrates the release of the year's Beaujolais nouveau. In odd-numbered years in early December, the island hosts its prestigious Jazz à la Martinique. Both top local talent and internationally known musicians like Branford Marsalis perform at this jazz festival. Jazz Festivals all over the Caribbean are very enjoyable.
Cuisine.
French and Creole cuisine dominate Martinique's culinary landscape. The two styles also combine by using French techniques with local produce, such as breadfruit, cassava, and christophine (chayote). Creole dishes rely heavily on seafood, including curries and fritters. An exception is boudin, a Creole type of blood sausage. A dash of Chien sauce (made from onions, shallots, peppers, oil, and vinegar) adds a spicy touch to meals. The favored island drink, Ti punch, is a mixture of five parts of white rum to one part of sugarcane syrup. Crêperies, brasseries, and restaurants featuring cuisine from various French regions can be found all over Martinique.
History of French Antilles culture.
Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc was a French trader and adventurer in the Caribbean, who established the first permanent French colony, Saint-Pierre, on the island of Martinique in 1635. Belain sailed to the Caribbean in 1625, hoping to establish a French settlement. In 1626 he returned to France, where he won the support of Cardinal Richelieu to establish French colonies in the region. Richelieu became a shareholder in the Compagnie de Saint-Christophe. In 1635 d'Esnambuc sailed to Martinique with one hundred French settlers to clear land for sugarcane plantations.
After six months on Martinique, d'Esnambuc returned to St. Christopher, where he soon died prematurely in 1636, leaving the company and Martinique in the hands of his nephew, Du Parquet. His nephew, Jacques Dyel du Parquet, inherited d'Esnambuc's authority over the French settlements in the Caribbean. In 1637, his nephew, Jacques Dyel du Parquet, became governor of the island. He remained in Martinique.
The French permanently settled on Martinique after being driven off Saint Kitts and Nevis by the British. Fort Royal (Fort-de-France) on Martinique was a major port for French battle ships in the region from which the French were able to explore the region. In 1638, Jacques Dyel du Parquet (1606-1658), nephew of Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc and first governor of Martinique, decided to have Fort Saint Louis built to protect the city against enemy attacks.
Carnival had arrived with the French, indentured laborers and the slaves, who could not take part in Carnival, formed their own, parallel celebration called canboulay (from the French "cannes brulées", meaning burnt cane) - the precursor for Trinidad's carnival and has played an important role in the development of Trinidad's culture. During the carnival season, the slaves performed songs in tents called Kaiso - later Calypso tents. Many early kaiso or calypso were performed in the French creole language and led by a griot or chantwell.
Calypsonians and Calypso Monarch competitions emerged and became extremely popular. Steelbands emerged all around Dominica and the rest of the Caribbean islands.
In the 1960s, a number of Haitian musicians to the French Antilles (Guadeloupe and Martinique) brought with them the kadans (another word named for the genre "compas"), a sophisticated form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences.

MV Isle of Lewis

MV "Isle of Lewis" is a ro-ro ferry operated by Caledonian MacBrayne between Oban and Castlebay, Barra. Built in 1995, she remains one of only three ships in the CalMac fleet over in length; the others, , being longer by almost 15 metres and being just over 1 metre longer. 
Originally built to operate between Ullapool and Stornoway, "Isle of Lewis" rarely deviated from that route for 20 years. Since March 2016, she has served the Isle of Barra all year round from Oban. The only other routes operated by CalMac she has ever worked on is the triangle between Uig, Lochmaddy &amp; Tarbert and between Oban and Craignure, but only ever during an emergency.
History.
"Isle of Lewis" was built by Ferguson Shipbuilders in Port Glasgow on the River Clyde and entered service in July 1995. When constructed she was largest ship ever built by Ferguson's. Her crossing time of around 2 hours and 45 minutes improved upon that of her predecessor, , by at least 45 minutes.
With increasing traffic on the crossing, there was speculation that "Isle of Lewis" might be replaced by a larger vessel. In September 2013 the freight vessel was chartered to relieve pressure on the route. On 10 June 2012, it was announced that a new £42 million replacement ferry was to be built in Germany. The new 116 metre long ROPAX ferry was named and is capable of continuous operation, with a capacity for up to 700 passengers, and 143 cars or 20 commercial vehicles. "Loch Seaforth" entered service in mid-February 2015 and took over both passenger and freight duties on the route. Since moving to the Barra service in March 2016, "Isle of Lewis" has been relegated to the role of Stornoway relief ship each October when "Loch Seaforth" departs for overhaul, with a second relief ship taking care of overnight freight traffic, owing to "Isle of Lewis"' inability to carry certain hazardous cargo due to her fully enclosed and sealed car deck.
In June 2015, to assess her future deployment, "Isle of Lewis" undertook a tour of major terminals for berthing trials, with varied results. She called at Lochmaddy, Castlebay, Oban, Craignure, Brodick, Ardrossan, Troon, Campbeltown, and Tarbert between 4 and 9 June. No immediate decision was announced. Major work would be required to offset her stern ramp to starboard instead of to port, for her to operate on routes including Mull and Arran. Such adjustments would not prevent her returning to Stornoway for relief work, as both Stornoway and Ullapool harbours now have full-width linkspans.
In September 2015, it was announced that the "Isle of Lewis" was to become the Oban–Castlebay vessel from the following summer, thus allowing to commence daily return sailings between Lochboisdale and Mallaig.
"Isle of Lewis" was on duty at Oban and Castlebay in 2017 when she undertook a series of special sailings between 4 and 6 June to transport those travelling to attend the funeral of Eilidh MacLeod, a Barra schoolgirl who died in the Manchester Arena bombing. As a mark of respect, the "Isle of Lewis" was shown with her CalMac pennant, along with the Barra flag, at half mast.
A history of the "Isle of Lewis" by Mark Nicolson was published by The Islands Book Trust on 31 July 2016, in time for the 21st anniversary of the vessel's inauguration in 1995.
In September 2024, CalMac confirmed provisional plans to retire "Isle of Lewis" and after the new vessels and are introduced to the fleet. From then, "Isle of Lewis" will be replaced on the Barra crossing by .
Layout.
"Isle of Lewis" is a further development of and ' design with a fully enclosed car deck. The car deck is accessed by bow and stern ramps, the latter being offset from the centre of the ship to accommodate the linkspan in Ullapool. The bow ramp is a folding design that is watertight and further protected by a conventional upward hinging bow visor. The bow ramp was originally off-set to suit Stornoway's original linkspan until new facilities opened in April 1997. During an overhaul at Greenock in 2016, the bow ramp was changed to be off-set to port in order to prepare her for her new role as the summer Barra ferry, to make berthing in Oban easier.
There are three lanes to port and two to starboard of the central casing. A hydraulically operated mezzanine deck along each side can be raised or lowered according to traffic requirements. Two stairways from the car deck bring passengers out in the entrance square on deck 4, where the passenger gangways enter.
The entrance square houses the information desk and gift shop. Forward is a large cafeteria overlooking the bow and occupying the full width of the ship. Aft are a designated dog area and a truckers' quiet lounge, with the reclining lounge and bar at the stern. Deck 5 houses the observation lounge at the bow, crew accommodation further aft and an open promenade deck stretching down both sides of the ship. Four stairways lead up to the open top deck, where seating is available.
The upper works of the ship are completed with two raked funnels in red and black company colours and two buff coloured masts. The smaller mast is on top of the wheelhouse and carries the twin radar scanners and radio antennae, while the larger mast is mounted aft on the promenade deck, carrying antennae and the house flag. During the winter refit in 2009, the funnels were fitted with angled exhaust extensions on the funnel tops to direct engine exhaust away from the decks. They were later removed during her 2019 overhaul. The ship carries a fast rescue craft and two large motor-driven lifeboats, one to port and one to starboard, with a set of automatically deploying inflatable life rafts. The two large lifeboats were replaced in 2019 with new inflatable life rafts.
Service.
"Isle of Lewis" spent the first twenty years of her career sailing back and forth between Ullapool and Stornoway. Until April 2015, she had hardly sailed on any other route, and has endured some treacherous seas crossing The Minch, some of the most exposed waters around the British Isles. Tidal constraints from her 4.2 metre draught make her unsuitable for full-time use on other routes. Her ramps not being suitable for many of the linkspans around the CalMac network further reduces her versatility.
Over the years, "Isle of Lewis" has called at other stations for a variety of purposes. During her initial delivery voyage in July 1995, she called at Ardrossan to collect supplies and be formally handed over to her new owners, and then called at Uig, Lochmaddy &amp; Tarbert for berthing trials to assess her suitability on the 'Uig Triangle' should an emergency arise there, and making her debut calls at Ullapool and Stornoway a few hours later.
Two calls at Lochmaddy followed in April &amp; May 1998, under charter to transport Ministry of Defence traffic to and from North Uist. However, "Isle of Lewis" suffered a major breakdown at Lochmaddy on the first charter, requiring repairs lasting roughly four weeks and being replaced at Stornoway by the smaller "Isle of Mull". On 28 November 1998, whilst returning from an overhaul at North Shields, "Isle of Lewis" called at Stromness, Orkney for the purpose of 'showing the flag' to demonstrate CalMac's keen bid for the Northern Isles ferry services instead of the then-incumbent P&amp;O Scottish Ferries.
Further calls on the 'Uig Triangle' by "Isle of Lewis" in 2008 and 2015. Firstly, in November 2008, a call was made at Uig to uplift stranded freight traffic whilst Ullapool's linkspan was closed for maintenance. On 3 April 2015, "Isle of Lewis" made her first commercial sailing on a route other than between Stornoway and Ullapool, when she carried out a special sailing from Uig to Lochmaddy for the benefit of extra Easter traffic travelling to North Uist. Further extra sailings - helped by the demotion of "Isle of Lewis" to the status as a back up vessel following her displacement by the new "Loch Seaforth" - followed. "Isle of Lewis" sailed between Tarbert and Lochmaddy on two consecutive evenings in June 2015. When "Hebrides" broke down in July 2015, "Isle of Lewis" relieved her on the full service between Uig, Lochmaddy and Tarbert for two days.
Around the time that strike action by the RMT union took in June 2015, "Isle of Lewis" was drafted in to assist at Oban, and was to make her first sailings between Oban and Castlebay. This included a unique 0046 departure from Oban to Barra, on the same day as the annual Barrathon was taking place. Following redeployments due to the separate breakdowns of "Finlaggan" &amp; "Lord of the Isles" in August 2015, "Isle of Lewis" again took over the Oban to Castlebay services, sailing direct, and omitting Lochboisdale due to her being far too large and deep to use the South Uist facilities.
In early 2016, "Isle of Lewis" relieved on the Scrabster - Stromness route for NorthLink whilst sailed for her refit. This was a reciprocal arrangement after provided cover at Stornoway during the dry-docking of "Loch Seaforth".
In March 2016, "Isle of Lewis" began a new phase of her life, serving Oban and Castlebay on Barra year-round, which allowed to commence a daily return service between Lochboisdale and Mallaig, thus ending South Uist's direct link to Oban. With "Isle of Lewis" deployment there, the Isle of Barra receives a daily dedicated service. These summer arrangements, announced by Transport Scotland, are likely to be a stop-gap until the new and go into service on the Arran route. On her first official day on the Barra service, 25 March 2016, "Isle of Lewis" completed all of her sailings in spite of an amber alert of adverse weather and swell conditions.
"Isle of Lewis" returned to the Stornoway - Ullapool service in April and May 2021, while was undergoing repairs to the port engine. This left to combine the Lochboisdale and Castlebay services.

Murasame-class destroyer (1958)

The "Murasame"-class destroyer was a destroyer class built for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) in the late 1950s as a successor to the destroyers. Like its predecessor, its main task was anti-submarine warfare, but its improved weaponry also enabled it to perform better in the anti-air role, so this class was classified as "DDA" (anti-air destroyer or all purpose destroyer) unofficially.
Like its predecessor, the , this class adopted a "long forecastle" design with inclined afterdeck called , named after the scenic sloping street in Nagasaki City. The propulsion system was almost the same as that of the .
The sensor suite and weapon system was almost the same as that of the latter batch of the "Ayanami" class, but three 5-inch/54 caliber Mark 16 guns (with Mark 39 single mounts) were added to extend effective range against air and surface threats in addition to four 3-inch/50 caliber Mark 22 guns (with Mark 33 dual mounts). The 5-inch guns were controlled by one Mark 57 GFCS, and the 3-inch guns were done by one Mark 63 controller. The main air-search radar was an OPS-1, the Japanese version of the American AN/SPS-6.

The Duck Factory

The Duck Factory is an American sitcom produced by MTM Enterprises that aired on NBC from April 12 until July 11, 1984. It was Jim Carrey's first lead role in a Hollywood production. It was also the only time Don Messick, famously the voice of Scooby-Doo, appeared in a live-action role, although he also voiced a cartoon character within the sitcom as well. The show was set at a small independent animation studio, and was co-created by Allan Burns and Herbert Klynn. It won two Emmy Awards.
Background.
Burns had started his career as a writer/animator for "The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show" and "George of the Jungle" before turning to live action and co-creating "The Mary Tyler Moore Show"; Klynn had worked in various production capacities on "Mr. Magoo" and "Gerald McBoing-Boing", amongst many other cartoons.
Overview.
The premiere episode introduces Skip Tarkenton (Carrey), a somewhat naive and optimistic young man who has come to Hollywood looking for a job as a cartoonist. When he arrives at a low-budget animation company called Buddy Winkler Productions, he finds out Buddy Winkler has just died, and the company desperately needs new blood. So Skip gets an animation job at the firm, which is nicknamed "The Duck Factory" as their main cartoon is "The Dippy Duck Show".
Other Duck Factory employees seen regularly on the show were man-of-a-thousand-cartoon voices Wally Wooster (played by real-life cartoon voice artist Don Messick); cynical, sometimes lazy comedy writer Marty Fenneman (played by real-life comedy writer Jay Tarses); veteran artist and animator Brooks Carmichael (Jack Gilford); younger storyboard artist Roland Culp (Clarence Gilyard); sarcastic editor Andrea Lewin; and hard-nosed, penny-pinching business manager Aggie Aylesworth. Buddy Winkler Productions was now owned by Buddy's young, ditzy but good-hearted widow, Mrs. Sheree Winkler (Teresa Ganzel), a former topless ice dancer who had been married to Buddy for all of three weeks before his death.
Production.
Seen in some episodes were clips from various "Dippy Duck" cartoons the Buddy Winkler crew were working on—sometimes fully animated, sometimes in pencil sketch or animatic form. The opening and closing credits were also animated. Series co-creator Klynn was also credited as the show's "creative animation consultant", while production of the actual animated material was done by Ted and Gerry Woolery for which each won an Emmy.
Show history.
"The Duck Factory" lasted thirteen episodes; it premiered April 12, 1984. It was directed primarily by Gene Reynolds, Rod Daniel, and Victor Lobel, who each did three episodes. The show initially aired at 9:30 on Thursday nights, directly after "Cheers" (at the time, not yet a top ten hit; "Cheers" finished the 1983/84 television season in 34th place). The show replaced "Buffalo Bill" on NBC's schedule. Jay Tarses, an actor on "The Duck Factory", had been the co-creator and executive producer of "Buffalo Bill", which had its final network telecast on Thursday, April 5, 1984.
Episode ordering.
NBC broadcast "The Duck Factory" episodes out of the producers' intended order. This led to significant continuity issues with the series, rendering certain plot developments almost incomprehensible.
Most notably, episode 1 ended on a series of cliffhangers that were then apparently left unresolved, as the intended episode that would have resolved them wasn't shown. Instead, the eighth episode in the intended order (in which Skip is promoted to being the producer of "The Dippy Duck Show", much to the resentment of the show's staff) was shown as episode 2.
Later episodes were also shown wildly out of order, meaning that as broadcast, succeeding episodes ping-ponged between Skip being the show's producer, and Skip being the show's low-ranking apprentice animator, with no explanation as to the reason for his constant change of status. As well, amongst other baffling developments, Mrs. Winkler was the company's receptionist in second episode as broadcast—but then in the fourth episode she "becomes" the receptionist. Finally, what the producers had intended to air as the second episode (and which set up the continuing premise of the series) was shown as the thirteenth and final episode. Unfortunately, the plot developments of this episode and the character relationships made absolutely no sense in the context of what had already transpired in episodes 2-12 (as broadcast).
The show changed timeslots in June, moving to Wednesdays at 9:30. The last original episode of "The Duck Factory" was broadcast on July 11, 1984.
Home media.
In 1995, at the height of Carrey's career, some episodes of the series were released in the United States on two VHS videocassettes by MTM Home Video. One tape contained the first three episodes, and the other, the final three. These two volumes were released in the United Kingdom in 1997, slightly expanded so that the first four episodes were on one tape and the last four (which had never been broadcast in the UK) were on the other.

Mauro Gianetti

Mauro Gianetti (born 16 March 1964 in Lugano) is a Swiss former professional road cyclist and later directeur sportif. Gianetti was employed as team manager for the cycling team throughout its existence between 2004 and 2011. In 2016, Gianetti coordinated the acquisition of Lampre-Merida's UCI WorldTeam license as part of a project backed by TJ Sport Consultation. After difficulties arose with TJ Sport, Giuseppe Saronni and Gianetti secured the backing of the United Arab Emirates and formed the current UAE Team Emirates UCI WorldTeam. Gianetti currently sits on the Board of Directors of UAE Team Emirates and serves as the Team Principal and CEO.
Several riders were sanctioned for doping violations that occurred during his tenure as directeur sportif at Saunier Duval, including Riccardo Riccò and Juan José Cobo. 
With over 30 professional victories, Gianetti's biggest career accomplishments as a rider include winning the 1995 Liège–Bastogne–Liège and Amstel Gold Race and representing Switzerland at the 2000 Summer Olympics.
His son Noé Gianetti is also a former professional cyclist.
Doping incident.
During the 1998 Tour de Romandie, Gianetti abandoned during a stage and later became unconscious. He was taken to Lausanne University Hospital where he remained on the intensive care for 10 days, as his life was in danger. Initially, doctors suspected an infection, but all tests came back negative. Two doctors then suspected that Gianetti had been transfused with a perfluorocarbon emulsion, to increase the oxygen carrying capacity of his blood. This was reported to the authorities and an investigation was opened. According to legal documents and witness testimony uncovered by Radio France, Gianetti blocked the public release of this investigation by filing for damages when he discovered the identities of the whistleblower doctors who reported him. Gianetti filed for 900,000 Swiss francs from Dr Jean-Pierre Randin and 3 million Swiss francs from Dr. Gérald Grémion. In the 2025 Radio France report, Grémion confirmed that the financial pressure forced him to negotiate with Gianetti's lawyer to reach an agreement. “In exchange, I had to promise never to speak publicly about this person again,” Grémion told Radio France"." “You could say that my silence was bought.”
After retirement.
Gianetti became assistant director of Dante Lam, and helped to film the Milan leg of Taiwanese movie To The Fore.

Space Power Facility

Space Power Facility (SPF) is a NASA facility used to test spaceflight hardware under simulated launch and spaceflight conditions. The SPF is part of NASA's Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility, which in turn is part of the Glenn Research Center. The Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility and the SPF are located near Sandusky, Ohio (Oxford Township, Erie County, Ohio).
The SPF is able to simulate a spacecraft's launch environment, as well as in-space environments. NASA has developed these capabilities under one roof to optimize testing of spaceflight hardware while minimizing transportation issues. Space Power Facility has become a "One Stop Shop" to qualify flight hardware for crewed space flight. This facility provides the capability to perform the following environmental testing:
Thermal-vacuum test chamber.
This is a vacuum chamber built by NASA in 1969. It stands high and in diameter, enclosing a bullet-shaped space. It is the world's largest thermal vacuum chamber. It was originally commissioned for nuclear-electric power studies under vacuum conditions, but was later decommissioned. It was subsequently recommissioned for use in testing spacecraft propulsion systems. Recent uses include testing the airbag landing systems for the "Mars Pathfinder" and the Mars Exploration Rovers "Spirit" and "Opportunity", under simulated Mars atmospheric conditions.
The facility was designed and constructed to test both nuclear and non-nuclear space hardware in a simulated low-Earth-orbiting environment. Although the facility was designed for testing nuclear hardware, only non-nuclear tests have been performed throughout its history. Test programs performed at the facility include high-energy experiments, rocket-fairing separation tests, Mars Lander system tests, deployable solar sail tests, and International Space Station hardware tests. The facility can sustain a high vacuum (10−6 torr, 130 μPa), and simulate solar radiation via a 4 MW quartz heat lamp array, solar spectrum by a 400 kW arc lamp, and cold environments () with a variable geometry cryogenic cold shroud.
The facility is available on a full-cost reimbursable basis to government, universities, and the private sector.
Aluminum test chamber.
The aluminum test chamber is a vacuum-tight aluminum plate vessel that is in diameter and high. Designed for an external pressure of and internal pressure of , the chamber is constructed of Type 5083 aluminum which is a clad on the interior surface with a thick type 3003 aluminum for corrosion resistance. This material was selected because of its low neutron absorption cross-section. The floor plate and vertical shell are (total) thick, while the dome shell is . Welded circumferentially to the exterior surface is aluminum structural T-section members that are deep and wide. The doors of the test chamber are in size and have double door seals to prevent leakage. The chamber floor was designed for a load of 300 tons.
Concrete chamber enclosure.
The concrete chamber enclosure serves not only as a radiological shield but also as a primary vacuum barrier from atmospheric pressure. in diameter and in height, the chamber was designed to withstand atmospheric pressure outside of the chamber at the same time vacuum conditions are occurring within. The concrete thickness varies from and contains a leak-tight steel containment barrier embedded within. The chamber's doors are and have inflatable seals. The space between the concrete enclosure and the aluminum test chamber is pumped down to a pressure of during a test.
Brian Cox of the BBC's "Human Universe" filmed a rock and feather drop episode at the Space Power Facility.
Electromagnetic interference/compatibility (EMI/EMC) functionality.
Designed specifically as a large-scale thermal-vacuum test chamber for qualification testing of vehicles and equipment in outer-space conditions, it was discovered in the late 2000s that the unique construction of the SPF interior aluminum vacuum chamber also makes it an extremely large and electrically complex microwave or radio frequency cavity with excellent reverberant electro-magnetic characteristics. In 2009 these characteristics were measured by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and others after which the facility was understood to be, not only the world's largest Vacuum chamber, but also the world's largest EMI/EMC test facility. In 2011, the Glenn Research Center successfully performed a calibration of the aluminum vacuum chamber using IEC 61000-4-21 methodologies. As a result of these activities, the SPF can perform radiated susceptibility EMI tests for vehicles and equipment per MIL-STD-461, and can achieve MIL-STD-461F limits above approximately 80 MHz. In the spring of 2017 the low-power characterizations and calibrations from 2009 and 2011 were proven correct in a series of high-power tests performed in the chamber to validate its capabilities. The SPF chamber is currently being prepared for EMI radiated susceptibility testing of the crew module for the Artemis 1 of NASA's Orion spacecraft.
Reverberant Acoustic Test Facility.
The Reverberant Acoustic Test Facility has 36 nitrogen-driven horns to simulate the high noise levels that are experienced during a space vehicle launch and supersonic ascent conditions. The RATF is capable of an overall sound pressure level of 163 dB within a chamber.
Mechanical Vibration Test Facility.
The Mechanical Vibration Test Facility (MVF) is a three-axis vibration system. It will apply vibration in each of the three orthogonal axes (not simultaneously) with one direction in parallel to the Earth-launch thrust axis (X) at 5–150 Hz, 0-1.25 g-pk vertical, and 5–150 Hz 0-1.0 g-pk for the horizontal axes.
Vertical, or the thrust axis, shaking is accomplished by using 16 vertical actuators manufactured by TEAM Corporation, each capable of . The 16 vertical actuators allow for testing of up to a article at the previously stated frequency and amplitude limits.
Horizontal shaking is accomplished by four TEAM Corporation Horizontal Actuators. The horizontal actuators are used during vertical testing to counteract cross axis forces and overturning moments.
Modal test facility.
In addition to the sine vibe table, a fixed-base modal floor sufficient for the diameter test article is available. The fixed-base modal test facility is a thick steel floor on top of of concrete, that is tied to the earth using deep tensioned rock anchors.
There were over of rock anchors, and of concrete used in the construction of the fixed-base modal test facility and mechanical vibration test facility.
Assembly area.
The SPF layout is ideal for performing multiple test programs. The facility has two large high bay areas adjacent to either side of the vacuum chamber. The advantage of having both areas available is that it allows for two complex tests to be prepared simultaneously. One can be prepared in a high bay while another is being conducted in the vacuum chamber. Large chamber doors provide access to the test chamber from either high bay.

Quiraing

The Quiraing () is a landform on the eastern face of Meall na Suiramach, the northernmost summit of the Trotternish escarpment on the Isle of Skye, Scotland. It takes the form of a craterous hollow surrounded by a high rampart of rock. Within the hollow is a raised plateau the size of a football field, known as the Table. Other distinctive features of the landscape are the Needle, a jagged pinnacle rising to , and the Prison, a mass of rock resembling a medieval keep.
Like the rest of the Trotternish escarpment, the Quiraing was formed when a thick layer of flood basalt spread over the peninsula and destabilized the weak sedimentary rocks below, causing a succession of landslides. It has been renowned for its fantastical appearance since the Victorian period. The poet Alexander Smith dubbed it "a nightmare of nature".

Whitmer High School is a public high school in Toledo, Ohio, named for John Wallace Whitmer, an educator who helped organize high school classes for the area. It is the only high school in the Washington Local School District in Lucas County, Ohio, serving the northwest section of Toledo up to the Michigan state line. It is the largest high school in the Toledo area. Whitmer offers 200 courses including honors and AP classes, 16 career training programs, 22 varsity sports, and more than 50 extracurricular activities. Students regularly receive district, state, and national accolades in art, music, and career training competitions.
History.
Whitmer Senior High School opened in 1924 in the Jefferson building. In 1960, the Whitmer building opened. In 1974, the Whitmer Vocational Building, now the Career and Technology Center (CTC), opened.
Renovations.
In 2006, Whitmer High School underwent several renovations. Among the renovations was a total overhaul of the Homer S. Nightingale Center for the Performing Arts, including an expanded lobby. A new gym and new Fieldhouse lobby were added to the school.
In 2007, Whitmer Memorial Stadium had artificial turf installed, and the track was widened. The endzones show a large "WHITMER" with a blue background and yellow lettering, with a white stroke.
Athletics.
The school's athletic teams are known as the Panthers, and their jersey colors are maize and blue. Whitmer High School is a member of the Ohio High School Athletic Association and the Northern Lakes League. The Panthers played in the Great Lakes League (GLL) until 2003 when they became members of the Toledo City League until 2011. Whitmer won GLL football titles in 1967 and 1968 before spending part of the early 1970s as an independent and then returning to the GLL. Whitmer won their first outright Toledo City League football title in 2009 with a 9-1 record. Whitmer had been playing many City League teams in all sports for years prior to joining the league. One of the school's biggest rivals are the Start Spartans; the two teams meet annually to play for the "Battle of Tremainsville". Another one of the school's biggest rivals are the Clay Eagles; Whitmer and Clay meet annually to play for the coveted "Little Brown Jug." During the GLL days, the Bedford Mules of Temperance, Michigan were the Panthers' biggest rival.
Whitmer High School is a member of the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) and its football team has qualified for the state playoffs for four of the last five years. The 1986 team went undefeated and 1987 and 1988 made it to the state semi-finals. Led by senior Ryne Smith, the 2007-2008 Panthers made an unexpected run to the state final four in basketball. 2010 City League Football champions and Regional State Champions with a 12-2 overall record. 2010-2011 City League Basketball Champions with an overall 19-1 record. In 2011, after being picked to finish 6th in the Toledo City League, the Whitmer Varsity baseball team defeated the Start Spartans 10-8 in the final TCL Championship after falling behind 8-1. The win also secured Whitmer with its first ever All-Sports Trophy in the CL.

<doc id="6904173" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6904173" title="Treason Act 1945">
Treason Act 1945

The Treason Act 1945 (8 &amp; 9 Geo. 6. c. 44) was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
It was introduced into the House of Lords as a purely procedural statute, whose sole purpose was to abolish the old and highly technical procedure in cases of treason, and assimilate it to the procedure on trials for murder:
It also abolished the rule that treason trials in Scotland had to be conducted according to the rules of English criminal law.
Provisions.
Section 1.
Section 1 of the act applied the Treason Act 1800 (39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3 c. 93) to all cases of treason and misprision of treason, subject to five separate repeals of words, and to a saving clause in section 2(2):
Section 2.
Section 2(1) of the act effected consequential repeals.
The application of the Treason Act 1800 was subject to a saving clause in section 2(2).
Section 3.
Section 3(1) of the act provided that it may be cited as the "Treason Act, 1945".
Section 3(2) of the act extended the Treason Act 1800 (39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3 c. 93), as applied by the act, to Northern Ireland.
Section 3(3) of the act provided that, for the purposes of section 6 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5. c. 67), the act was to be deemed to be an act passed before the appointed day.
Use of the act.
The procedure established by this act was used in four trials: those of William Joyce, John Amery, Thomas Haller Cooper and Walter Purdy. J. W. Hall said that if the statutory requirement for corroboration had not been repealed by this act, William Joyce could not have been convicted on the basis of the evidence offered at his trial. One witness, Detective Inspector Hunt, connected him with the broadcasts "during the period before the expiration of the passport" (though other witnesses might have come forward).
Repeal and replacement.
The whole act was repealed in England and Wales by the Criminal Law Act 1967, and replaced by section 12(6) of that act.
The whole act was repealed in Scotland by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980. Today, equivalent provision is made in section 289 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995.
The whole act was repealed in Northern Ireland by the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967, and replaced by section 14(7) of that Act.

Akizuki-class destroyer (1959)

The "Akizuki"-class destroyer was a destroyer class built for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) in the late 1950s. This class was planned to be a flotilla leader with the enhanced command and control capability, so sometimes this class was classified as the "DDC" (commanding destroyer) unofficially.
Design.
Initially, the American Military Assistance Advisory Group-Japan (MAAG-J) recommended a modified version of the American , but Japan had already constructed surface combatants of their own at that time. As a result, the project of this class was financed by the Off Shore Procurement (OSP) of the United States, but design and construction were completely indigenous.
Like its predecessors, the and es, this class adopted a "long forecastle" design with inclined afterdeck called , named after the scenic sloping street in Nagasaki City. With the enlargement of the hull, the steam turbine propulsion system was uprated with higher-pressure boilers (570 psi).
This class was equipped with both the gunnery weapons of the "Murasame" class and the torpedo/mine weapons of the "Ayanami" class. Alongside these anti-submarine weapons, and similar to those of the "Ayanami" class, the "Akizuki" class were the first vessels equipped with a Mk.108 Weapon Alpha. While the JMSDF desired this American ASW rocket launcher originally, it became clear that its performance wasn't as good as was believed. It was later replaced by a Type 71 quadruple ASW rocket launcher (the Japanese version of the Swedish M/50) in 1976.

Jacob Kaufman

Jacob Kaufman (15 July 1847 – 20 April 1920) was a manufacturer and industrialist in Berlin, now Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. He built a large lumber operation and pioneered the manufacturing of rubber outerwear.
Biography.
Kaufman was born July 15, 1847, in North Easthope Township to German parents, Joseph Kauffman and Anna Stroh. One of ten children, Kaufman only attended school during the winter months, working on the family farm the remainder of the year. At the age of 22 he accepted a position in Gads Hill working for Henry Ratz as a sawyer, where he remained for eight years. Kaufman married Ratz's daughter, Mary (1856-1943), in 1877 and moved to Berlin, Ontario. Together they had seven children, though only four - Emma (1881-1979), Alvin (1885-1979), Milton (born 1886) and Edna (1891-1983) - would live to adulthood.
Following his move to Berlin, Kaufman founded a planing mill with assistance from his father-in-law. To address a dwindling supply of lumber in the region, Kaufman purchased a plot of land in Muskoka, operating sawmills in Rosseau Falls and Trout Creek to help meet demand. Although his decision to locate the mill outside of city was initially questioned by friends, the success of the business resulted in multiple expansions and allowed Kaufman to buy out his father-in-law. In 1888 the original factory, at the time deemed inadequate, was enclosed by a new building and torn down only after the new building was complete, an approach that caused operations to be halted for only ten days. In 1897, Kaufman built a Victorian style home at 621 King Street West with an office window that allowed him to survey his rubber factory. Sold in the late 1940s, it housed the Ratz-Bechtel Funeral Home funeral home until 2015.
Kaufman is credited with establishing Kitchener's rubber industry. In 1899 he founded Berlin Rubber Manufacturing Company Limited alongside A. L. Breithaupt, Louis Weber and George Schlee. The plant was located on Margaret Avenue, at one time employing 65 people and producing about 800–1,000 pairs of rubber boots a day. Although the company was successful, Kaufman had a falling out with the group, resulting in him leaving to launch his own business. He founded the Merchants Rubber Co. in 1903 with Talmon Henry Rieder. The company specialized in rubber-based garments and footwear for fisherman and miners and was sold in 1906 to the Montreal-based Canadian Consolidated Rubber Company, that also acquired Berlin Rubber. The following year Kaufman founded the Kaufman Rubber Company Limited with his son A.R. Kaufman, which would go on to become Kaufman Footwear.
A resident of Kitchener for 43 years, Kaufman was a member of the Zion Evangelical Church played an active role local government, believing in public ownership of local utilities. He served as a member of commissions related to water and light, helping to electrify the city and establish a sewage disposal system. 
Death.
Kaufman died on April 20, 1920, at home in Kitchener. His estate was valued at $278,879, $50,000 of which was designated for distribution to charitable, religious or educational endeavours at the discretion of his wife and children, who acted as executors. He was remembered by "Chronicle Telegraph" as a "town builder" for his role and influence in the development of various local industries. He was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in the Kaufman family plot.

Catherine Hardy Lavender

Catherine Hardy Lavender (née Catherine Hardy) (February 8, 1930 – September 8, 2017) was an American athlete who competed mainly in the 100-meter dash. She won an Olympic gold medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay at the 1952 Olympic Summer Games in Helsinki, Finland. Later, Hardy married, had children, and a 30-year teaching career in Atlanta schools.
Early life and education.
Hardy Lavender was born in Carroll County, Georgia, the third of eight children born to Ernest and Emma (Echols) Hardy. After graduating from Carroll County Training School at age 16, she wanted to attend Tuskegee Institute. Her family was a farming family of limited means, however; so she attended Fort Valley State College (now Fort Valley State University) instead. Though West Georgia College (now University of West Georgia) was only a few miles from Hardy's home in Carrollton, schools were still segregated and as an African-American, Hardy had to look elsewhere to attend college.
In college, Hardy continued playing basketball and enjoyed it. Raymond Pitts, the track coach at Fort Valley, encouraged her to look into track. She agreed, and in 1949, she ran and won her first race at the Tuskegee Relays. Two years later, she won the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) indoor meet in New York City, winning the 50-yard dash and setting a new American record. From 1951 to 1952, she made All-American. In 1952, Hardy received her B.S. degree in business education. After graduation, she trained hard in preparation for AAU events and the Olympic tryouts. At the AAU, Hardy was a triple winner, winning the 50-yard dash, as well as the 100- and 200-meter races.
To the Olympic Games.
At the U.S. Olympic tryouts in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Hardy set an American record in the 200-meter run, thus securing a position on the 1952 U.S. Olympic Women's Track Team. She was the only representative of the state of Georgia that year in the Olympics, held in Helsinki, Finland. There, she anchored the 4 × 100 meter relay. She won the gold medal with her teammates Mae Faggs, Barbara Jones and Janet Moreau. This particular race was an upset, because the Australians and their star, Marjorie Jackson, whom they called "Jet", were heavily favored to win. A poor baton transfer, however, beat the Australians' chances.
Originally, Janet Moreau was to serve as the anchor for the team, but when the coach realized that Hardy was the fastest runner on the team, the order was changed. Photographs and video of the race show that the race was quite close, but the US runner Hardy was the one who broke the tape at the finish, edging out Germany, who took the silver medal, and Great Britain, who won the bronze medal. Hardy's time in the 100 meters she ran was faster than the winning time in the 100-meter race at this Olympics. Although Hardy had been slated to compete in that event as well, a poor showing in one of the heats stopped her advancement. Despite this fact, Hardy and her teammates set a new world record, and brought home the gold in this event. Upon returning to the States, Hardy was greeted with a ticker tape parade in her hometown. In 1999 she was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame.
Personal life.
Hardy was offered coaching positions in the northern U.S., but chose to enter her field of study—education—in Atlanta, Georgia. There she settled, marrying the late Edward Wright Lavender, Sr. in 1956, and bearing two children—a son Edward Lavender, Jr. in 1957, and a daughter Stephanie in 1960. Hardy Lavender continued teaching, having a career that lasted over 30 years. She retired in 1986 to care for her aged mother who had Alzheimer's disease. After her mother died in 1987, Hardy Lavender returned to education by substitute teaching in the Atlanta Public Schools system.
She was a devout member of Jehovah's Witnesses.

Beautifully and hauntingly musical, this thriller also has a political and personal intrigue that mounts inexorably as the sun begins to set on this fateful day. By the time night has fallen in the city, the crossing of these individual fates is sealed. Each of these four women has found their destiny amidst the brutality that the film reveals.
Reception.
The film most received negative reviews. Robert Koehler of Variety wrote "...in the end, the extremely repetitive use of certain sound and images has truly diminishing returns.

F. F. Worthington

Major-General Frederic Franklin Worthington MC, MM, CD (September 17, 1889 – December 8, 1967), nicknamed "Worthy" and "Fighting Frank", was a senior Canadian Army officer. He is considered the father of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps.
Early life and career.
Worthington was born in Peterhead, Scotland. His military career began, somewhat unofficially, as a mercenary. He served in the Nicaraguan Army in the war against San Salvador and Honduras, but when the Nicaraguan Republican government fell, the army dissolved and Worthington left the country to avoid capture. He later found work sailing on cargo steamers.
The life of a mercenary was appealing to Worthy, and he soon found himself back in the thick of things, this time gunrunning to Cuba for which he was imprisoned in Cuba in 1908. In 1913, Worthy fought on the side of Francisco Madero in the Mexican Civil War against the Diaz government. His war service was short-lived however, as he was wounded in a battle.
Worthington served in the Canadian Machine Gun Corps in 1917. He was awarded the Military Medal for actions near Vimy Ridge, on 6 January 1917 for holding his position during a German advance. He was later awarded a bar to his MM.
After the First World War, he was a proponent of adopting armoured fighting vehicles. As a captain, Worthington took an eight-month course in the Canadian Armoured Fighting Vehicle School at Camp Borden in 1930, equipped with twelve Carden Loyd machine gun carriers. In 1936, then Major Worthington became an instructor at the Royal Tank School in Bovington Camp near Dorset, England, returning to Borden to assume the post of Commandant of the Canadian Armoured Fighting Vehicle School in 1938. Thanks to Worthington's determination, Canada acquired its first tanks in 1938: two Vickers light tanks, and ten more the following year.
Second World War.
In 1940, the Canadian Armoured Corps was formally established (the Royal prefix was granted in 1945). As its first senior officer, Colonel Worthington bought 265 US-built M1917 tanks of First World War vintage to use in training. Because U.S. neutrality laws prohibited the sale of weapons to Canada, these antiques were bought for $120 each as scrap metal from the Rock Island Arsenal by the "Camp Borden Iron Foundry". During the Second World War Worthington organized the 1st Canadian Tank Brigade (later the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade, an independent formation) and then converted the 4th Canadian Infantry Division to an armoured division in only five months. The division served overseas under the designation 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division and included the 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade and the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade.
In early 1944, Worthy was forced to relinquish command of the 4th Armoured Division, "officially" due to poor health, but in fact it was due to changes in Canada's Army commanders. Worthy supported Lieutenant-General Andrew McNaughton, but it was Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds who got command of II Canadian Corps. Worthy was simply edged out in favour of others. It was the biggest regret of his career that he never commanded a Division in war. Simonds would later admit that he had made a mistake taking Worthy's command away from him (Ref: ""Worthy": A Biography of Major-General F.F. Worthington CB, MC, MM" by Larry Worthington).
In 1944 he returned to Canada to administer Camp Borden, where replacements were trained for the Canadian Armoured Corps and Infantry, as well as the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps and the Canadian Provost Corps. Worthy soon discovered that other things had changed since he left in 1942. Black market selling was out of control by this time, with fuel, food and building materials being the hot items. Worthy as usual had an unconventional method of stopping the stolen items from leaving the camp. He posted Provost Marshals at the gates to search vehicles leaving, forcing the thieves to take the back roads and trails to get out of camp. Worthy had the engineers dig trenches to make it impossible for vehicles to get through.
The most unconventional method however, was having the engineers lay landmines on the back trails, with the trigger points set back about 50 yards, thus ensuring that no one would actually get hurt. The troops got the message though, as no one wanted to take any chances with a commander who mined roadways.
The National Resources Mobilization Act (NRMA) of 1940 made military service compulsory for in-country service, but overseas service remained voluntary. Those who still refused to go active service met with Worthy's unconventional methods of training and persuasion, including being virtual targets of live-fire exercises and being forced to work so hard around the camp that they "volunteered" because it was the lesser of the evils.
Worthington served as General Officer Commander in Chief of Pacific Command from 1 April 1945 to 26 January 1946. Later he was appointed the first Colonel-Commandant of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps.
Later life.
Worthy died on 8 December 1967 at Ottawa's Military Hospital. After his funeral in Ottawa, Worthy's body was flown by a RCAF Caribou aircraft to Camp Borden and in accordance with his wishes, was interred in Worthington Park. Four Centurion tanks fired a 13 gun salute and three RCAF Chipmunk aircraft did a low-level "fly-past", in tribute to a great soldier and Canadian.
One of the things that his son, "Toronto Sun" columnist and founding editor Peter Worthington, always remembers about his father is that he used to say, "Until Vimy Ridge he really never felt Canadian, but after Vimy Ridge never felt he was anything but a Canadian."
Today Worthington Park remains as a strong reminder of the birthplace of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps and a tribute to its father, Frederic Franklin "Fighting Frank" "Worthy" Worthington.
After Worthington's death, he was buried at Canadian Forces Base Borden according to his wishes. His wife was eventually buried beside him. The Major-General F.F. Worthington Memorial Park is also home to the tank collection of the Base Borden Military Museum. The Worthington Trophy for best Canadian armoured regiment was named after him.
Honours.
He was a recipient of the Military Cross (MC) and Bar, the Military Medal (MM) and Bar and the Canadian Forces Decoration CD with two Bars.

Camp Cariboo

Camp Cariboo is a Canadian children's television program that aired on several CTV stations from 1986 to 1989. The show is best known for its rerun stint on YTV from September 2, 1989 to August 15, 1997.
Premise.
"Camp Cariboo" grew out of the summer camping experiences of Tom Knowlton and Mark Baldwin, as well as the producer and co-creator Janis Nostbakken and directors John Matlock and Paul Francescutti. The series was produced at CKCO-TV in Kitchener, Ontario, and filmed in part on location in Ontario Camping Association camps. Hosted by Tom and Mark, each show featured real kids along with a variety of short skits, riddles, songs and stories, all portrayed in the setting of a fictional summer camp. Viewers took part by sending in their jokes, riddles and challenges that were shared during mail call time in the camp office.
An audio CD called "I Love Camp Cariboo" has been produced by the Cariboo team and is available on iTunes.
Main characters.
Tom and Mark were the main characters of the show. Most episodes featured the two in interactive songs and sketches with kid-campers and in how-tos and comedy bits. Tom and Mark had alter-egos, "The Keeners", a couple of ageless campers so intent on coming back to camp each year that Tom and Mark gave them their moniker. In reality, the clips were in fast motion so that their voices would sound higher. The Keeners appeared in segments sharing camping tips taken to extremes and punctuated by one-liner jokes and groaners. Their popular theme song, "I've Got a Head Like a Ping-Pong Ball", became a cult hit and a generation of kids grew up reciting the Cariboo credo: "We'll follow the path where the cariboo walked, Our cariboo headgear is off, on, locked!" The coveted eyes-and-antlers ball caps worn by the Keeners were featured in an exhibit at the Waterloo Region Museum. Another regular character was Uncle Wes (played by Tom) in a segment called "Woodsy Wisdom". Wes would usually make appearances around the camp fire telling old stories and offering camping advice.
Reception.
The series was developed in close collaboration with kids from the Kitchener-Toronto region and pilot-tested before the final magazine-show format was decided upon. Positive feedback from audiences and critics on the first series of shows led to production of four more seasons. Camp Cariboo was honoured with four national television awards: two CanPro Gold Awards and two awards from The Children's Broadcast Institute (now Youth Media Alliance YMA).

Marinaleda

Marinaleda () is a Spanish municipality of the province of Seville that belongs to the region of Sierra Sur, located in the basin of Genil, in the autonomous community of Andalusia. It has an area of and a population of 2,778 inhabitants according to the 2011 census, with a population density of . It belongs to the judicial district of Estepa.
Marinaleda is a predominantly agricultural municipality and this makes up the bulk of its economy. It is noted for its left-leaning principles based on a leftist ideology led by Juan Manuel Sánchez Gordillo, mayor from 1979 to 2023 and a member of the Unitarian Candidacy of Workers (CUT). Local workers and peasants have achieved a high rate of development and practically full employment for its people. The development of an alternative economic mode has achieved notable results, even during the economic crisis that began in 2008.
Critics claim that this economic and social progress is due in part to the fact that almost 66% of the income received by the City of Marinaleda is from administrative superiors such as the state, the autonomous community, and the Provincial Council of Seville. In reality, Marinaleda receives less than the average remittance received by municipalities in Andalusia (in 2011 it received around 6.61% less than the regional average).
Marinaleda is part of the "Network of Municipalities for the Third Republic" and the tricolor flag is present in civil buildings.
Geography.
The town is located at an altitude of and lies east of the provincial capital, Seville. Marinaleda belongs to the comarca of Estepa and is situated between this latter town and Écija, in the eastern part of the province of Seville, in the basin of the Genil river. Its geographical coordinates are .
History.
The first indications of human settlement in the territory now covered by the Marinaleda municipality go back to the late Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, about 5,000 years ago. Stone tools and traces of seeds and dwelling places have been found.
There was a major Roman presence, and some date the foundation of the village to this period. The Roman road connecting the villages of Astigi (present-day Écija) and Ostippo (Estepa) ran by Marinaleda, and there have been many discoveries from the period.
The Arab presence is visible in monuments such as the Towers of Gallape and the fortress of Alhonoz. The region was conquered by the Christian monarchs in the 13th century, and Marinaleda came under the rule of the religious Order of Santiago. Philip II granted the village to the first Marquess of Estepa, and it would remain under this ownership until manors were dissolved in the 19th century.
Marinaleda then grew as a population centre due to the influx of day labourers working for large landowners, especially the Marquesses of Estepa. There is evidence that, in 1751, there were 60 houses lived in by landless labourers, who earned two reals for a full day's work.
In the 18th century, Marinaleda had three clergymen and a shop belonging to the Marquess of Peñaflor, who lived in Écija. The main economic activity was rain-fed agriculture.
During the 19th century in Marinaleda and neighbouring territories, there were several groups of bandits involving residents of the municipality. Notable groups include those commanded by José María Hinojosa Cobacho, "", "El Pernales", and Juan Caballero.
In 1931, the population of Marinaleda was 2,318, of whom only 317 were entitled to vote. The elections of 12 April that year were won by monarchist supporters, whereas those of 31 May were won by republicans. The final elections of the Republican period, on 16 February 1936, were won by the Popular Front.
At the start of the Civil War, troops supporting the coup assassinated the mayor, Vicente Cejas Moreno, his son, and at least 30 other residents. In the postwar period, the population suffered great poverty, hunger, and repression. The poor survived by gleaning olives and acorns from the fields of the estates.
The industrialization of Spain beginning in the 1960s encouraged emigration from Marinaleda to industrial areas, especially Catalonia, as well as to other countries such as Germany, France, and Switzerland.
Upon the death of Francisco Franco in 1975, the dictatorship he had established in Spain gave way to a representative democracy. In 1977, the (Union of Farm Workers) was founded in Marinaleda. The following year, a struggle for land began with a two-day occupation of the Bocatinaja estate, between Osuna and Los Corrales.
The first post-Franco municipal elections were held in 1979. The Colectivo de Unidad de los Trabajadores (Workers' Unity Collective) won in Marinaleda, gaining 9 of the 11 council seats. The new council replaced street names associated with the victors of the Civil War by names of left-wing heroes. For example, Muñoz Grandes street became Che Guevara street, the Plaza of Spain became the People's Plaza, and the Plaza of Francisco Franco was renamed after Salvador Allende.
In 1980, 700 people staged a 13-day hunger strike, demanding better pay and stricter regulation of the old system of employment. The success of this action led to intensification of the land struggle, with further occupations of large landowners' estates under the slogan "Land to those who work on it". In 1984, the Cordobilla marsh was occupied for 30 days to demand irrigation for a farm called , property of the Duke of Infantado, facilitating its later expropriation.
In 1985, the occupation of estates increased in number by at least 100, as well as in length, extending to over 90 days. This led to many legal actions.
In 1991, a tract of El Humoso farm was handed over to Marinaleda for the use of the population. Demonstrations demanding a life of dignity increased between 1992 and 1994, with many occupations of government buildings and institutions.
In 1997, irrigation was extended to the whole of the El Humoso, and the Marinaleda S.C.A. A cooperative was founded to cultivate the farm collectively. Three years later, a food processing plant was set up, supplied by the raw materials of the cooperative: piquillo pepper, beans, artichokes, and olives. An oil press was also built. Production continued to increase, and employment along with it.
During the euro area crisis, while 30% of the active population in Andalusia was without work, Marinaleda had full employment.
The social and political system that has been implemented in the community, and the good results obtained in terms of economic development and well-being of the inhabitants, has brought Marinaleda to the attention of the media in Spain and abroad.
The "Social Democracy" tab on the town's website states the following:
In 2023, Juan Manuel Sánchez Gordillo, mayor of Marinaleda since 1979, retired due to ill health. His successor is Sergio Gómez Reyes.
Local government.
For over 40 years, the mayor of Marinaleda has been Juan Manuel Sánchez Gordillo of the United Left Party. Gordillo has anointed Marinaleda a "utopia for peace", which has no municipal police (saving $350,000 a year). Additionally, political murals and revolutionary slogans adorn the town's whitewashed walls and streets are named after Latin American leftists. Every few weeks, the town hall declares a Red Sunday over a bullhorn and volunteers clean the streets or do odd jobs.
Marinaleda has a long tradition of sociopolitical struggle by agricultural labourers, which has decisively influenced the attainment of diverse political and social advances. Marinaleda was ruled by CUT-BAI (Collective for the Unity of Workers - Andalusian Left Bloc) from 1979 until 1986, when CUT-BAI joined United Left (IU), which has since been the ruling party, although most of the members of IU's local branch are basically members of CUT-BAI.
Local economy.
The town operates a farming cooperative with 2,650 workers. Marinaleda is surrounded by sloping olive groves and features a farm. The farm is located north of Marinaleda, and grows labour-intensive crops like artichokes, hot peppers, broccoli, and broad beans, as well as wheat.
Town planning.
Marinaleda represents a local exception of the national housing crisis caused by real estate speculation. The municipality was the subject of national news when it became known that one could own a house in this town for no more than 15 euros per month through the self-building program.
Self-building.
The Ayuntamiento (local government) of Marinaleda bought and expropriated thousands of square metres of land, now communal property, for the construction of new houses. Land, building materials, and architectural plans are provided to the self-builder through public grants. Free assistance from professional builders is also provided. The hours spent by the resident on construction (if any) are deducted from the total cost. Prospective owners usually donate about 450 days of their work to the construction. Finally, a monthly payment of up to 15.52 euros is arranged with the contractors and the government for the resident to achieve ownership. To prevent speculation, citizens are prohibited from selling their homes.
Layout.
Marinaleda's citizens reside in a colony of neat houses, each with three bedrooms, one bathroom, and a garden of , allowing for future expansions. In recent years 350 single-family homes have been built according to this scheme, even though the town has fewer than 3,000 inhabitants.

Western Province cricket team

Western Province is a professional Western Cape first-class cricket team which has been part of the South African domestic cricket structures since the 1890's. The team later restructured into the Cape Cobras which became part of the Cricket South Africa Franchise era from 2005 to 2021. The current Western Province Professional teams was re-formed in 2021/22 under the CSA domestic restructuring. Whereas many teams opted to keep their former franchise brands, Cape Cobras elected to return to their traditional name.
Western Province is one of South Africa's most successful cricket teams in the 21st century, having won the Currie Cup 18 times, with 3 shared trophies from 1892 to 2004. During the franchise era era the Cape Cobras amassed 5 titles in the First Class, One Day Cup and T20 Challenge competitions from 2003-2022. The professional teams have since grown with the Western Province Women's team gaining professional status in 2024.
Western Province Cricket is based at the Iconic Newlands Cricket Ground dubbed the Heart of Cricket where cricketing legends such as Jacques Kallis, Vernon Philander, Hershelle Gibbs, Andrew Puttick and JP Duminy have all been part of the Western Province structures. During the franchise era the Cape Cobras incorporated Boland Park as a shared venue with Newlands Cricket Ground from 2002 to 2022.
Western Province Men currently compete in the CSA 4-Day Domestic Series, CSA One-Day Cup and the CSA T20 Challenge with the Women's professional team competing in the CSA W One Day Cup and CSA W Pro20.
History.
Cape Colony.
Cricket in South Africa, like many other Commonwealth nations, was first introduced by the British when the Cape Colony was ceded to Great Britain by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814. By the middle of the 19th century, cricket was well established in Cape Town, with Cape Colony Schools adopting the game by the 1850s as the sport gradually expanding further inland by settlers. In 1862, an annual fixture called 'Mother Country v Colonial Born' was hosted for the first time in Cape Town, with popularity leading to the founding of Western Province Cricket Club in October 1864. In 1876, Port Elizabeth began the 'Chamption Bat Tournament' between teams representing the major settlements of the Cape Colony, such as Cape Town, Grahamston, Kingwilliamstown and Port Elizabeth. The settlement-based format continued until the 1890–91 season when Western Province, Eastern Province and Griqualand took to the field for the first time instead.
Western Province Currie Cup.
Sir Donald Currie, the founder of the Castle Shipping Line and the sponsor of the 1889 English tour, donated a trophy for the champions of the promising domestic competition. The 'Currie Cup' was first awarded to Kimberley, who had beaten Transvaal in the single match competition of 1889–90. From 1892 to 1893, the competition began to take the familiar form of province-based competition in a champion format, inspired by the English County Cricket structure.
Western Province joined the competition for the 1892–93 season, winning the Cup on its first attempt. The Currie Cup was not contested every year, and a total of fourteen seasons were contested between its inception and the First World War. Aside from an interruption during the Boer War, typically seasons were not held when the English team were touring. The competition took on several different formats, including a knock-out structure, and a round-robin followed by a challenge final against the previous year's winner; but in 1906–07, a round-robin league format was established, which would be unchanged until 1982–83. Between 1892–93 and 1912–13, Western Province won the Cup five times, being particularly dominate in the 1890s.
In the interwar years, again the Currie Cup was not competed every year. Largely due to travel constraints, the Cup was not held in seasons when there was a Test tour of South Africa. Of the 12 seasons played, Western Province won two in an era of Transvaal dominance. First-class cricket was later suspended upon the outset of the Second World War in 1939 as South Africa declared war on Germany.
Western Province won a further eight Cups between 1946 and 1991 in sporadic fashion, with the team failing to win the title at any point in the 1960s. At the end of the 1965–66 season, Western Province were relegated to the Second Division for the first time since the two division format was introduced in 1951. They would later be promoted back to the First Division for the 1969–70 season, going on to share the title with Transvaal. From 1972, the two division format was retained but promotion and relegation scrapped, with the top division remaining constant with five teams: Transvaal, Natal, Eastern Province, Western Province and Rhodesia. By this time the stronger provinces had begun fielding a 'B Team' in the lower division, although could not be promoted. From 1975, Western Province fielded a 'B Team' of their own, however the lower division eventually split away to form the 'Castle Bowl' – in essence a separate Currie Cup Second XI Competition.
The dominance of the Transvaal, Natal and Western Province finally came to a close after Eastern Province beat Transvaal at the end of the 1988–89 season. Prior to, the three teams had amongst them won 59 of the 60 Currie Cups contested, with the exception being Kimberley's win in 1890–91.
Western Province was largely immune to the political changes after 1994 that altered the domestic structure. Whereas many teams changed name, for instance Transvaal to Gauteng in 1997, Western Province continued until the Franchise Era of 2004–2021.
During this time, one-day cricket was included in the domestic structure, with its matches having List-A status. Western Province won five one-day titles between 1981–82 and 2003–04, with three being back to back between 1985 and 1988.
Franchise era.
In 2004–05, the format of South African domestic cricket was changed entirely. The eleven provincial teams were rationalised into six entirely professional new teams, for all three formats. Western Province merged with Boland to form the Cape Cobras, being based in Cape Town. With the Currie Cup now called SuperSport Series for commercial reasons, the six new franchises were intended to create a stronger top-tier sides with a second-tier semi-professional tournament based around the old provincial teams.
Playing 17 first-class seasons, the Cape Cobras were the second most successful team behind Titans with 4 outright titles. In the one-day series, Cape Cobras managed two outright and two shared wins, the most recent being 2013–2014. A T20 league had also been devised for the domestic structure within South Africa, with Cape Cobras securing two title wins by 2021–22.
Recent history.
In 2020, domestic cricket in South Africa was restructured once more and the six former franchise teams were dropped. In its place was a return to the more traditional two-division league format, with a total of fifteen professional teams competing. For this, the previously semi-professional provincial cricket competition was absorbed, effectively forming the league's second division. Promotion and relegation between the two divisions, not seen since the start of the franchise era in 2004, will return after the 2023–24 season. From 2019, provinces and cricket unions submitted bids to CSA to make a case to be considered for the top division for the initial two seasons. The bidding process was overseen by the Independent Evaluation Committee (IEE) who took into account a range of criteria, such as cricketing and financial operations, women's and age-group development, transformation policies and stadium infrastructure. Eight teams make up the first division, with 16 contracted players each, and seven teams the second division, with 11 contracted players each, taking the total number of professional players to 205.
Many of the provinces elected to keep their previous franchise branding, even with a return to the more traditional province defined structure. Of the First Division, only Cape Cobras elected to return to their former name of Western Province.

State of the Art (book)

State of the Art: Film Writings 1983–1985 is the eighth collection of movie reviews by the American critic Pauline Kael.
In the Author's Note at the beginning of this collection she wrote: 
Kael reviews 117 films in this eighth collection. She gives rich praise to the work of performers and directors she admires, for example, Molly Ringwald's performance in "Sixteen Candles", - Steve Martin, Robin Williams, and Nick Nolte, ( three perennial Kael favourites), and Luchino Visconti, for his work on The Leopard - ""The Leopard" is so beautifully felt that it calls up a whole culture. It casts an intelligent spell - intelligent and rapturous." (Though Visconti's film had originally been released in 1963, Kael is here reviewing the release of a full length three hours and five minutes version). And she's typically cool to work she regards as second rate; 'When you come out of Desperately Seeking Susan, you don't want to know who the director is - you want to know who the perpetrator is.' And Steven Spielberg's segment of - a, " lump of ironclad whimsy. It's as if Steven Spielberg had sat down and thought out what he could do that would make his detractors happiest." And Sylvester Stallone's work on "Staying Alive"; "What can be done about this mock writer-director-producer-actor? He has become the stupidos' Orson Welles." 
Films she recommends in this eighth collection include "The Survivors", "The Grey Fox", "The Leopard", "Under Fire", "Heart Like a Wheel", "Yentl", "Choose Me", "Splash", "Moscow on the Hudson", "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", "Repo Man", "Dreamscape", "Carmen", "Utu", "Stop Making Sense", "A Soldier's Story", "Comfort and Joy", "Independence Day", "Mrs. Soffel", "A Passage to India", "Micki + Maude", "The Makioka Sisters", "The Return of the Soldier", "A Private Function", "The Purple Rose of Cairo", "Heartbreakers", "Lost in America", "Ghare Baire", "Prizzi's Honor", "The Shooting Party".
The book is out-of-print in the United States, but is still published by Marion Boyars Publishers in the United Kingdom.

Princes Quay

Princes Quay is a shopping centre in the heart of Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. The centre is unusual in that it is built on stilts over "Prince's Dock" after which it is named. It was opened in 1991.
Description.
To take advantage of its location the shopping centre is constructed with large windows giving visitors panoramic views of the Hull Marina and the dock. The centre also builds its image on a nautical theme, for example by calling its retail floors "decks", although most shoppers still refer to them as floors.
The centre, built round a central atrium, opened to the public on 15 March 1991 and consisted of 3 decks of over 80 retail outlets. The centre includes a "Food Court" on the lowest deck, known as "Harbour Deck". A fourth floor, known as "Top Deck", was converted from retail units in 2007 into a 10-screen cinema by Vue with Europe's first digital screen.
A 1,000 place multi-storey car park is integrated with the centre and is accessed from the main A63 when travelling eastbound into the city. Princes Quay is well served by public transport with many bus routes stopping immediately outside the centre and with Hull Paragon Interchange only a few minutes' walk away. 
In February 2011 a plan to revamp the food court into several new casual dining restaurants, overlooking the dock commenced and has seen the return of Pizza Express to the city and has also seen Nandos open a second outlet in the city centre. The restaurants are already proving popular and add to the already increasing vibrancy of Princes Dock Street. Other major restaurant operators such as Wagamama are rumoured to be taking a place in the new food quarter.
Quay West expansion project.
In December 2006, outline planning permission was granted for the western expansion of the centre. The £300 million retail development, known as Quay West, would add of shopping space, 60 shops and two department stores. It would also feature cafés and restaurants and a leisure complex comprising a health and sports club as well as a 175-bedroom hotel. The site was earmarked to open in 2011 and it was thought the development would inject an extra £42.66 million per year into the local economy. The project was cancelled in October 2010 due to a change in ownership, the economic downturn and cuts to regeneration projects.
Refurbishment.
In August 2015 plans were announced to give the centre a multimillion-pound makeover.
By February 2016 plans included the development of up to 28 new outlets on what has been marketed as the Outlet Deck, the ground floor food court was also to receive a facelift. By October 2016 Next was announced as the new anchor tenant for the development and that work would be starting with a completion expected for Easter 2017.
Trivia.
Since 1991, the Hull International Canoe Polo tournament has been held every July on the waters surrounding the shopping centre. The tournament is organised and run by Kingston Kayak Club; a local club based at Albert Avenue Pools Complex. One of the local teams, 'Humbersiders', have always been prominent and have been crowned champions on three occasions.

Malinovo, Slovakia

Malinovo (, ) is a village and municipality in western Slovakia in Senec District in the Bratislava Region.
Names and etymology.
The original name comes from a Germanic personal name Eberhardt. The earliest mentions are "Yberhart" (1209), "Ybrehart" (1216), "Eburhardi" (1260). In 1946, the village was renamed to "Malinovo" in honor of Soviet Marshal Rodion Malinovsky. "Éberhárd" is still the official name in the language of the Hungarian minority.
Geography.
The municipality lies at an altitude of 128 metres and covers an area of 8.829 km2.
History.
In historical records the village was first mentioned in 1209. In the 13th century, the village was inhabited by Germans who lived there until the 16th century. Malinovo was an important port on the Little Danube where also river tolls were charged. In 1548, the village was already completely abandoned and re-settled again. In 1773, it was already mostly Hungarian.
The old village castle was acquired in June 1763 by Count György Apponyi of the Apponyi family. It was rebuilt into its current form by the Apponyis in the early 19th century. Statesman György Apponyi died in the castle in 1899, and his son Albert Apponyi often received guests there. In 1923 it became the home of the State Agricultural School of Czechoslovakia. It is still home to a Horticultural School named after Gustav Čejka ().
After World War I, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945, through the First Vienna Award, Malinovo became a part of Miklós Horthy's Hungary . After World War II, the Hungarian population was partially expelled and replaced by Slovaks from Hungary.
Point of Interest.

MHC restriction

In immunology, MHC-restricted antigen recognition, or MHC restriction, refers to the fact that a T cell can interact with a self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule and a foreign peptide bound to it, but will only respond to the antigen when it is bound to a particular MHC molecule.
Background.
When foreign proteins enter a cell, they are broken into smaller pieces called peptides. These peptides, also known as antigens, can derive from pathogens such as viruses or intracellular bacteria. Foreign peptides are brought to the surface of the cell and presented to T cells by proteins called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). During T cell development, T cells go through a selection process in the thymus to ensure that the T cell receptor (TCR) will not recognize MHC molecule presenting self-antigens, i.e that its affinity is not too high. High affinity means it will be autoreactive, but no affinity means it will not bind strongly enough to the MHC. The selection process results in developed T cells with specific TCRs that might only respond to certain MHC molecules but not others. The fact that the TCR will recognize only some MHC molecules but not others contributes to "MHC restriction". The biological reason of MHC restriction is to prevent supernumerary wandering lymphocytes generation, hence energy saving and economy of cell-building materials. 
Functional Importance.
T-cells are a type of lymphocyte that is significant in the immune system to activate other immune cells. T-cells will recognize foreign peptides through T-cell receptors (TCRs) on the surface of the T cells, and then perform different roles depending on the type of T cell they are in order to defend the host from the foreign peptide, which may have come from pathogens like bacteria, viruses or parasites. Enforcing the restriction that T cells are activated by peptide antigens only when the antigens are bound to self-MHC molecules, MHC restriction adds another dimension to the specificity of T cell receptors so that an antigen is recognized only as peptide-MHC complexes.
Development.
MHC restriction in T cells occurs during their development in the thymus, specifically positive selection. Only the thymocytes (developing T cells in the thymus) that are capable of binding, with an appropriate affinity, with the MHC molecules can receive a survival signal and go on to the next level of selection. MHC restriction is significant for T cells to function properly when it leaves the thymus because it allows T cell receptors to bind to MHC and detect cells that are infected by intracellular pathogens, viral proteins and bearing genetic defects. Two models explaining how restriction arose are the germline model and the selection model.
The germline model suggests that MHC restriction is a result of evolutionary pressure favoring T cell receptors that are capable of binding to MHC. The selection model suggests that not all T cell receptors show MHC restriction, however only the T cell receptors with MHC restriction are expressed after thymus selection. In fact, both hypotheses are reflected in the determination of TCR restriction, such that both germline-encoded interactions between TCR and MHC and co-receptor interactions with CD4 or CD8 to signal T cell maturation occur during selection.
Introduction.
The TCRs of T cells recognize linear peptide antigens only if coupled with a MHC molecule. In other words, the ligands of TCRs are specific peptide-MHC complexes. MHC restriction is particularly important for self-tolerance, which makes sure that the immune system does not target self-antigens. When primary lymphocytes are developing and differentiating in the thymus or bone marrow, T cells die by apoptosis if they express high affinity for self-antigens presented by an MHC molecule or express too low an affinity for self MHC.
T cell maturation involves two distinct developmental stages: positive selection and negative selection. Positive selection ensures that any T-cells with a high enough affinity for MHC bound peptide survive and goes on to negative selection, while negative selection induces death in T-cells which bind self-peptide-MHC complex too strongly. Ultimately, the T-cells differentiate and mature to become either T helper cells or T cytotoxic cells. At this point the T cells leave the primary lymphoid organ and enter the blood stream.
The interaction between TCRs and peptide-MHC complex is significant in maintaining the immune system against foreign antigens. MHC restriction allows TCRs to detect host cells that are infected by pathogens, contains non-self proteins or bears foreign DNA. However, MHC restriction is also responsible for chronic autoimmune diseases and hypersensitivity.
Structural specificity.
The peptide-MHC complex presents a surface that looks like an altered self to the TCR. The surface consisting of two α helices from the MHC and a bound peptide sequence is projected away from the host cell to the T cells, whose TCRs are projected away from the T cells towards the host cells. In contrast with T cell receptors which recognize linear peptide epitopes, B cell receptors recognize a variety of conformational epitopes (including peptide, carbohydrate, lipid and DNA) with specific three-dimensional structures.
Imposition.
The imposition of MHC restriction on the highly variable TCR has caused heated debate. Two models have been proposed to explain the imposition of MHC restriction. The Germline model proposes that MHC restriction is hard-wired in the TCR Germline sequence due to co-evolution of TCR and MHC to interact with each other. The Selection model suggests that MHC restriction is not a hard-wired property in the Germline sequences of TCRs, but imposed on them by CD4 and CD8 co-receptors during positive selection. The relative importance of the two models are not yet determined.
Germline model.
The Germline hypothesis suggests that the ability to bind to MHC is intrinsic and encoded within the germline DNA that are coding for TCRs. This is because of evolutionary pressure selects for TCRs that are capable of binding to MHC and selects against those that are not capable of binding to MHC. Since the emergence of TCR and MHC ~500 million years ago, there is ample opportunity for TCR and MHC to coevolve to recognize each other. Therefore, it is proposed that evolutionary pressure would lead to conserved amino acid sequences at regions of contact with MHCs on TCRs.
Evidence from X-ray crystallography has shown comparable binding topologies between various TCR and MHC-peptide complexes. In addition, conserved interactions between TCR and specific MHCs support the hypothesis that MHC restriction is related to the co-evolution of TCR and MHC to some extent.
Selection model.
The selection hypothesis argues that instead of being an intrinsic property, MHC restriction is imposed on the T cells during positive thymic selection after random TCRs are produced. According to this model, T cells are capable of recognizing a variety of peptide epitopes independent of MHC molecules before undergoing thymic selection. During thymic selection, only the T cells with affinity to MHC are signaled to survive after the CD4 or CD8 co-receptors also bind to the MHC molecule. This is called positive selection.
During positive selection, co-receptors CD4 and CD8 initiate a signaling cascade following MHC binding. This involves the recruitment of Lck, a tyrosine kinase essential for T cell maturation that is associated with the cytoplasmic tail of the CD4 or CD8 co-receptors. Selection model argues that Lck is directed to TCRs by co-receptors CD4 and CD8 when they recognize MHC molecules. Since TCRs interact better with Lck when they are binding to the MHC molecules that are binding to the co-receptors in a ternary complex, T cells that can interact with MHCs bound to by the co-receptors can activate the Lck kinase and receive a survival signal.
Supporting this argument, genetically modified T cells without CD4 and CD8 co-receptors express MHC-independent TCRs. It follows that MHC restriction is imposed by CD4 and CD8 co-receptors during positive selection of T cell selection.
Reconciliation.
A reconciliation of the two models was offered later on suggesting that both co-receptor and germline predisposition to MHC binding play significant roles in imposing MHC restriction. Since only those T cells that are capable of binding to MHCs are selected for during positive selection in the thymus, to some extent evolutionary pressure selects for germline TCR sequences that bind MHC molecules. On the other hand, as suggested by the selection model, T cell maturation requires the TCRs to bind to the same MHC molecules as the CD4 or CD8 co-receptor during T cell selection, thus imposing MHC restriction.

Clay High School (Oregon, Ohio)

Clay High School is a public high school in Oregon, Ohio, United States, east of Toledo. It is the only high school in the Oregon City School District. The school is named for Jeremiah Clay, who donated his farmland for the school to be built on.
Over the last few years, the Clay High School Campus has undergone remodeling. An addition was made to the main building, while the old elementary and the Annex were demolished. The Main building was also gutted and redone.
The school colors are green and yellow. Their nickname is the Eagles, after their mascots, Eddy and Edna the Eagle. Clay was a member of the Great Lakes League until 2003 when they joined the Toledo City League. Clay's joining of the TCL made them the second non-Toledo team to join the league (Cardinal Stritch 1971-1994), though they had played the Toledo City League schools for years before joining. In 2011 Clay joined the newly formed Three Rivers Athletic Conference as a charter member. The Three Rivers Athletic Conference shut down in 2023, which made Clay, Findlay High School, Fremont Ross High School, and Whitmer High School join the Northern Lakes League.
Career Technical Education Programs.
Clay High School offers Career Technical Education (CTE) programs, also sometimes referred to as Career Tech, as a form of vocational education. The current CTE programs offered are:
Performing Arts.
Marching, Concert, and Symphonic Band.
The modern band program at Clay was started by Clay graduate and saxophonist Nancy Fox Bricker in 1952, cementing the band as a marching band known as the Clay High School Fighting Eagle Marching Band. After Mrs. Bricker became ill and her husband assumed directing duties, Clay graduate Charles Neal was made the new director in 1967. The traditions of the Clay band were continued and expanded by its next director, Clay graduate Brian Gyuras, who was named the new director in 1999 and brought back student direction of the band. The current band director is Joseph Kuzdzal, who has held the position since 2019.
The band performs at Clay football games and, during the off-season, performs concerts and other parades. The band is split into two sections based on grade level, the concert band for freshmen and sophomores, and the symphonic band for juniors and seniors. The band also has multiple subgroups in the form of jazz band and pep band. The band also claims the largest Alumni band in Ohio, which performs every other year during the homecoming football game.
Concert Chorale.
Clay High School includes a choir program in the form of Concert Chorale. The program educates students in various subjects of good musicianship and contributes to an enrolled student's fine arts credit needed to graduate. The program also puts on multiple concerts throughout the school year and performs at other events. The current director of the program is Thom Sneed.
The Concert Chorale is also host to Varsity Voices, an audition-based group that learns additional music outside of the school day to perform at concerts. The program also formerly had two gender based groups, a men's chorus and an all-female chorus named "Bel Canto".
Theater Department.
Aside from the Musical Theatre CTE program, Clay High School also has a theatre group in the form of the CHS Limelighters. The group typically puts on three productions per school year, and membership is open to the Clay student body. The group puts on a combination of musicals, plays, and one-acts and is under the direction of Thom Sneed, Leah Walsh, and Elizabeth Gibson.

Tant Strul

Tant Strul was a Swedish punk rock band that are considered as the leading all female punk rock band in Sweden, although they at times had a male member. The last setting before they split up was: vocalist, guitarist and songwriter Kajsa Grytt, keyboardist Malena Jönsson, bassist Liten Falkeholm, drummer Nike Markelius, and cellist Sebastian Öberg (from the Flesh Quartet).
History.
The band started in 1981 with band members Kärsti Stiege (the mother of Swedish pop star Lykke Li), Liten Falkeholm, Kajsa Grytt, Malena Jönsson and Micke Westerlund. Kärsti left after the first two singles, and Micke left after the first LP "Tant Strul" (1981) and was replaced by Nike. The band now consisted of four women: Kajsa Grytt, Malena Jönsson, Liten Falkeholm and Nike Markelius. After the second LP "Amason" (1983), Sebastian Öberg joined the group. After the third LP "Jag önskar dig" (1984) the group split up.
Their style of music got softer over the years, and by the time the cellist Öberg joined the group they could hardly be called a punk rock group any more. After the split, Kajsa Grytt and Malena Jönsson formed a duo who released two LP's with laid back songs, based on Malena's piano and Kajsa's voice: "Historier från en väg" (1986) and "Den andra världen" (1988). Then Kajsa Grytt became a solo artist who so far has released four albums: "Kajsa Grytt" (1990), "Revolution" (1994), "Är vi på väg hem" (2003) and "Brott och straff" (2006).
Before joining Tant Strul, Kajsa Grytt was briefly a member of Pink Champagne, and Liten Falkenholm played with Eldkvarn.

List of world featherweight boxing champions

Championship recognition.
Public Acclamation: 1884 to 1921.
Champions were recognized by wide public acclamation. A heavyweight champion was a boxer who had a notable win over another notable boxer and then went without defeat. Retirements from the ring periodically led to a "true" champion going unrecognized, or for several to be recognized by the public for periods of time. Typically, public interest in having a single, "true" champion resulted in claimants to the heavyweight title being matched with one another; the winner of that bout was subsequently deemed the champion, with the claim (and title lineage) of the defeated boxer largely forgotten.
Sanctioning Bodies: 1921 to present.
The National Boxing Association (NBA), was formed in 1921 as the first organization aimed at regulating boxing on a national (and later global) level. The prominence of New York City as the epicenter of boxing would lead to a governmental entity, the powerful New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC), to join the NBA in sanctioning bouts as "world championships." A third entity, with lesser public recognition inside the USA, the European Boxing Union (EBU), would follow suit, with this triumvirate typically (but not always) recognizing the same boxers as world champions.
At its 1962 convention the NBA's non-U.S. members exploited a membership rule and took control of the organization, rebranding it the World Boxing Association. The (WBA), was joined a year later by a combination of state and national boxing commissions (including the NYSAC and IBU) to form a separate sanctioning body, the World Boxing Council (WBC). Each organization would later have a spin-off competing sanctioning body emerge: the International Boxing Federation (IBF), which was formed by members of the United States Boxing Association in 1983; and the World Boxing Organization (WBO), which was formed in 1989. A fifth significant (but not as publicly accepted) body came in the form of the International Boxing Organization (IBO), in 1991, and today there are over a dozen sanctioning organizations, of varying degrees of public acceptance, sanctioning bouts as for a world championship and proclaiming their title winners "Champion of the World."

Redbergslids IK Fotboll

Redbergslids IK was a football club located in Gothenburg that played in the 1930–31 Allsvenskan, the Swedish top-tier league.
History.
The football team was a part of the sports club Redbergslids IK founded in 1916. In the 1929–30 season, they reached Allsvenskan by winning Division 2 Södra 11 points ahead of Malmö FF. The following season, 1930–31, they played in the Allsvenskan but were relegated. In the top division of Sweden the club attracted an average crowd of 8,898.
They were also punished for paying their players, which was against the rules at that time, when they gifted their players watches, by being demoted to the bottom of the Swedish football league system, Göteborgsserien IV. A result of this, Redbergslid lost their players to local teams IFK Göteborg, GAIS and Örgryte. For instance, Swedish internationals Rolf Gardtman and Sven Rydell moved to Örgryte.
In the 1960s, the club was back in Division 2 Södra and remained there a couple of seasons. Redbergslid played their last season in 2001, when they resided in the Swedish eighth-tier Division 7.
The team used black shirts and white shorts.

Freedom Suite (The Rascals album)

Freedom Suite is the fifth studio album (a double album) by rock band The Rascals, released on March 17, 1969. It peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and also reached number 40 on the Billboard Black Albums chart, the last Rascals album to appear there.
History.
"Freedom Suite" was an ambitious effort and something of a concept album. Packaging included a shiny silver gatefold album cover, with a photograph of the band pasted on the front, colored sleeves with the song lyrics printed on them, and illustrations drawn by members of the group. The latter varied from idealistic visions of trumpeting angels to Eastern-influenced sketchings to drummer Dino Danelli's faithful homage to El Greco's Christ. The inclusion of three instrumentals comprising one complete album of the two-record set—one polished track ("Adrian's Birthday," named in honor of recording engineer Adrian Barber), one jam session ("Cute"), and a Danelli drum solo ("Boom")—seemed to reviewer and critic Richie Unterberger as an effort by The Rascals to establish themselves as an "album" group rather than a "singles" group.
The first LP of the set contained conventional songs, while the second contained the instrumentals. Various session musicians, including bassist Chuck Rainey and saxophonists King Curtis and David "Fathead" Newman, augmented the band's normal line-up on several selections.
The album's content was packaged differently based on format and territory. In North America, the full "Freedom Suite" album, including the instrumentals, was available in a double album package on LP and on reel-to-reel tape. Cassette and 8-track tape editions, however, were packaged as either one double-play album or as two single albums ("Freedom Suite" and "Music Music") and could be purchased independently. In Great Britain, only the first record of the double album was distributed, with the instrumentals and inserts omitted completely.
The album contained the Rascals' last #1 hit single "People Got To Be Free," which was released in advance of the album in mid-1968. "A Ray of Hope/Any Dance'll Do" (November 1968) and "Heaven/Baby I'm Blue" (February 1969) were also issued as singles.
The political climate of the time helped fuel the songwriting efforts for "Freedom Suite"; most notably, "People Got to Be Free" was inspired by the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., and "A Ray of Hope" by the June 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy (the latter song's figurative "ray of hope" is surviving Kennedy brother Ted Kennedy). Cavaliere was quoted in "Billboard" magazine, remarking "After King and Kennedy and what happened in Chicago (i.e., the demonstrations and resulting police actions at the 1968 Democratic National Convention), we just had to say something."
Prior to this album, the Rascals' primary vocalists Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati co-authored most of the band's original songs. On "Freedom Suite", however, that trend began to change, with Cavaliere credited as sole author of four of the album's vocal tracks. Brigati's songwriting and vocal contributions would continue to decline on subsequent albums.
Reception.
The album was RIAA-certified as a gold record on April 21, 1969, rising to #17 on the Billboard Top LPs chart. It also reached #40 on the Billboard Black Albums chart, the last Rascals album to appear there. In Canada, it reached #20.
It was not especially well received; critic Lester Bangs would later write that "Freedom Suite" suffered from "excess," while critic Dave Marsh would later write that it "sowed the seeds of the group's demise, [as it] reflected an attempt to join the psychedelic craze."
Writing for Allmusic, critic Thom Jurek wrote of the album "if that outing ["Once Upon a Dream"] had been ambitious and even visionary, the double Freedom Suite, released in 1969 as the group's fifth album, was off the map. The band dug in and wrote a single LP's worth of solid tunes including a quartet of fine singles."

Claude Meisch

Claude Meisch (born 27 November 1971) is a Luxembourgish politician with a degree in financial mathematics from Trier university. Meisch was appointed Minister of Education in 2013 in the government of Xavier Bettel, a post he held until 2023. He was appointed Minister of Education and Youth and as Minister of Housing in 2023 in the government of Luc Frieden He has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 1999 to 2013 and Mayor of Differdange since 2002. He was President of the Democratic Party (DP) from 2004 until 2013, of which he has been a member since 1994.
Early life and education.
Born in Pétange, in the south-west of the country, Meisch attended the town's Lycée technique Mathias-Adam, before studying at the University of Trier, in Germany. After graduating, he worked for the private Banque de Luxembourg. Meisch was Vice-President of the Democratic and Liberal Youth, the DP's youth wing, from 1995 until 2000.
Political career.
Meisch ran for the Chamber of Deputies, to represent Sud, in the 1999 election. Meisch finished sixth amongst DP candidates, with the top four being elected. However, the election saw the DP become kingmakers, giving them enough leverage over the Christian Social People's Party (CSV) to allow them to appoint seven Democratic deputies, including Henri Grethen and Eugène Berger, to the new government. Grethen insisted that Berger be appointed along with him, specifically so that Meisch could enter the Chamber. With Grethen and Berger required to vacate their seats to take up their government positions, Meisch filled in the gap and entered the Chamber of Deputies on 12 August 1999.
In the 2004 legislative election, Meisch was re-elected to the Chamber directly, placing second amongst DP candidates in an election that saw the party's representation from Sud reduced from four to two. The result was bad for the DP across the country, losing five seats and seeing them replaced as the Christian Social People's Party's (CSV) coalition partners by the LSAP. After the election, Lydie Polfer resigned as DP President, having served the term limit imposed by the party's statutes. Meisch was the only candidate put forward to replace her, and recorded a 90% vote in his favour (between him and none of the above), holding the position since 10 October 2004.
The 2005 election to Differdange communal council saw Meisch score an 'historic' victory, in leading the DP to buck the national trend and greatly increase their vote: winning 43% of the vote and winning eight seats. Meisch thus remained as mayor, heading a coalition with the Greens, although the size of the victory allowed Meisch to choose his coalition partner from any of the other three parties.
In the 2009 legislative election, Meisch was re-elected, winning more votes that any other Democratic candidate in the entire country, and winning more than twice as many votes as Eugène Berger, who placed second on the DP list in Sud. The party nationwide fell 1.1% of the vote and lost a seat. Immediately after the election, Meisch ruled out a coalition with the CSV, so the DP continued in opposition.
Minister of Education.
In 2020, Meisch was at the centre of controversy when, as Minister of Education, he forced the Luxembourgish public schools to reopen in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic despite protests from the teachers union (SNE) and an online petition from 23,000 concerned parents urging him not to do so. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Education stated that "parents have no say in the matter".
In July 2021, in response to the effects of stress and emotional insecurity caused by the covid-pandemic, Claude Meisch as Minister of National Education, Children and Youth, inaugurated the "Achtsamkeitspfad" open-air "mindfulness" trail at the Munsbach Castle, designed and created by the Center for Social-Emotional Development (CDSE) to reinforce psychic balance, the first meditation concept of its kind in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Claude Meisch congratulated the CDSE for their initiative to promote awareness of emotional skills and well-being, and thanked the commune of Schuttrange for their support.
In 2023 he was appointed Minister of Education, Children and Youth and as Minister of Housing and Spatial Planning in the government of Luc Frieden.

List of military equipment of the Canadian Army in World War II

At the beginning of the Second World War, Canada did not have an extensive manufacturing industry besides car manufacturing. Therefore, most of Canadian weapons and equipment during the war were imported from either Britain or the US.
Small arms.
Grenades and grenade launchers.
This list is grossly incomplete, listing a small fraction of approximately 30 grenade varieties used by Canadians during World War II.
Flamethrowers.
Flamethrower, Portable, No 2 "Ack-Pack"
Artillery.
Heavy mortars &amp; rocket launchers.
Land Mattress
C-21 UCM -
Anti-tank weapons (besides anti-tank guns).
Bangalore torpedo (not a grenade or anti-tank)
Vehicles.
Canada produced a wide variety of combat vehicles during World War II domestically, but all primary fighting vehicles were imported because of manufacturing quality concerns.
Tankettes.
Carden Loyd Mk IV tankette - not used in combat
Self-propelled guns.
Other.
M3 75mm Gun Motor Carriage - M3 Half-track equipped with the M1A1 75 mm gun
Aircraft.
Although the Canadian government purchased and built thousands of military aircraft for use by the RCAF Home War Establishment (RCAF Eastern Air Command and RCAF Western Air Command) and the Canadian-based units of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, under the provisions of the plan Canada was to provide the training aircraft and facilities and a very large number of Canadian airmen would be committed to go overseas to fight in Article XV squadrons formed in the Great Britain and known as 400 series squadrons of the Royal Canadian Air Force. Forty-four of these squadrons were formed and most under this agreement were equipped by the British largely from their stocks and that is why many of the types of aircraft flown in combat in great numbers (such as the North American Mustang, Boulton Paul Defiant, Bristol Beaufighter, hundreds of Supermarine Spitfires of various marks, British built Avro Lancasters, Vickers Wellington, Hawker Typhoon, Short Sunderland, etc.) by most of the RCAF squadrons engaged in the fighting are missing from the following list altogether (or the quantities actually used by the RCAF overseas are not included in the numbers given below).

<doc id="6904483" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6904483" title="KRSK (AM)">
KRSK (AM)

KRSK (1080 kHz "105.1 The Fan") is a commercial AM radio station in Portland, Oregon. It is owned by Audacy, Inc. and runs a sports radio format. The studios and offices are on SW Bancroft Street in Portland.
KRSK is one of four sports stations in the Portland radio market, the others being co-owned KMTT, KPOJ (owned by iHeartMedia) and KXTG (owned by Alpha Media).
Signal.
The transmitter site is on NE Marine Drive in the northeast side of Portland along the Columbia River. KRSK is a Class B radio station. By day, it runs the maximum power for commercial AM stations in the U.S., 50,000 watts, audible around much of northwest Oregon and southwest Washington. At night, because AM 1080 is a clear channel frequency, KRSK must reduce power to 9,000 watts, so it does not interfere with co-owned KRLD in Dallas and WTIC in Hartford, the two dominant Class A stations on the frequency. KRSK uses a directional antenna at all times.
Programming.
KRSK is a network affiliate of ESPN Radio but mostly runs its own local shows on weekdays. Its sister station, 910 KMTT, carries the ESPN Radio lineup around the clock. As of July 22, 2025, the station starts the day at 6 a.m. with "Dirt and Sprague" in morning drive time. The 9-noon period is currenly in transition, as the station's long time carriage of The Herd with Colin Cowherd has recently ended, the program moving to Fox Sports Radio affiliate KPOJ. At noon, KRSK airs "Danny and Dusty". "Primetime with Isaac Ropp and Jason 'Big Suke' Scukanec" is heard on weekday afternoons from 3 to 7 pm. Primetime from 3-6 is mostly sports related. The last hour of the show is funny stories from mostly current events or news happening around the world. The first three hours of "Primetime" were simulcast on the Comcast SportsNet Northwest cable TV network. Nights and weekends, KRSK runs programming from ESPN Radio when it is not airing a live sports event.
History.
Early years.
This station was first licensed as KFWV, which signed on the air on October 12, 1925. In 1927, the call sign was changed to KWJJ, incorporating the initials of the station's founder, Wilbur J. Jerman. In the 1930s, KWJJ was powered at 500 watts, heard on 1060 kHz in the daytime, 1040 kHz at night.
After the enactment of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) in 1941, KWJJ moved to its current position on the dial, at 1080 kHz. The power was boosted to 1,000 watts. By the late 1940s, the power increased to 10,000 watts.
In 1946, KWJJ added an FM station, KWJJ-FM at 95.5 MHz. It was only powered at 3,400 watts and it mostly simulcasted the AM station. However, in the 1940s and 1950s, few radios could receive FM signals and management saw little opportunity to make it profitable. In the mid 1950s, KWJJ silenced the FM station, giving up the license. Another station signed on at 95.5 in 1959, which is today KBFF.
Switch to country.
KWJJ was acquired by Rodney F. Johnson in 1952. Johnson served as president and general manager as well. KWJJ became Portland's ABC Radio Network affiliate in 1959 and adopted a country music format on March 1, 1965. In the 1970s, the station's daytime power was increased to 50,000 watts, while it continues to operate at 10,000 watts at night.
In 1973, KWJJ was acquired by Park Communications. A year later, Park acquired KJIB, an FM station airing a beautiful music format. For the first years of Park ownership, KJIB remained easy listening and KWJJ remained country. In the late 1970s, Park moved KJIB from mainstream easy listening to a new format known as "Beautiful Country." The sound was soft, but used instrumental cover versions of country songs, rather than pop songs. With KWJJ as Portland's top country music station, management thought a beautiful country format on the FM station would be attractive to the AM station's advertisers.
KJIB switched to a conventional country format in the early 1980s. The FM station played mostly contemporary country hits with only a small amount of DJ chatter, while the AM station continued as a personality country outlet, going back several decades for its playlist of country tunes. On August 19, 1985, KJIB changed its call sign to the current KWJJ-FM. The two stations simulcasted the morning show and some other segments during the day.
KWJJ dropped its simulcast of KWJJ-FM in 1995, becoming a network affiliate for ABC's "Real Country," a classic country service.
Hot talk KOTK.
In 1996, Seattle-based Fisher Communications bought KWJJ-AM-FM for $35 million. Fisher continued the country format on KWJJ-FM, while making plans to change the AM station.
On October 27, 1997, KWJJ's call sign was switched to KOTK, and flipped to a "hot talk" format as "Hot Talk 1080 KOTK." Fisher added several sports play-by-play broadcasts to the station, including Washington Huskies football and basketball, Portland Pilots basketball and Portland Forest Dragons football.
KFXX and KRSK.
The KFXX call letters were first used in the Portland market on "The X", an active rock station on 1520 AM. KFXX flipped to its current sports format on September 1, 1990. KFXX and its sports format moved to AM 910 on March 29, 1998, swapping frequencies with adult standards-formatted KKSN. The station again swapped frequencies, this time with hot talk-formatted KOTK on March 19, 2004.
In its early days as a sports station, one of KFXX's hosts was Neil Lomax, a former quarterback at Portland State University and the St. Louis/Phoenix Cardinals.
In 2003, Fisher Communications sold KOTK and KWJJ-FM to Entercom for $44 million.
On July 24, 2025, Audacy filed to move the call sign KRSK from its sister station at 105.1 (which began simulcasting its sports format) to 1080 AM, with the station at 105.1 adding the -FM suffix to the existing KRSK call sign on FM, effective August 14, 2025.

It's Your Bet

It's Your Bet is an American game show which aired in syndication (mostly NBC owned-and-operated stations) from 1969 to 1973. The series was a revised version of the NBC game "I'll Bet," which aired for six months in 1965. Both "I'll Bet" and "It's Your Bet" were produced by Ralph Andrews.
Hosts.
During its four-year run, "It's Your Bet" had four hosts. Hal March hosted for the first few months. When health problems forced him to step down in late 1969 (he died in January 1970), actor Dick Gautier took over and hosted through the end of the 1970–1971 season.
Tom Kennedy moderated for the following year (1971–1972), followed by Lyle Waggoner, then an actor specializing in comedies and a regular repertory-company participant on "The Carol Burnett Show," for its final season. Kennedy had previously guest-hosted for March for a week which included Waggoner and his wife as guests.
Gameplay.
Front game.
The two celebrity couples played for members of the studio audience. One player on the team bet 25, 50, 75, or 100 points (always these increments and never more) on his/her spouse's ability to answer a question. A question was telephoned in secret to the betting player by the host; to ensure seclusion from the other player a motorized wall rose between the two players while the player was on the phone with the host, ensuring the question was not known to the spouse until after the bet had been placed.
In addition, the betting player had to bet whether his/her spouse could answer the question correctly ("CAN") or not ("CAN'T"). Bets were recorded on toteboards in the desk where the couples sat, with a special rotating trilon indicating "CAN" or "CAN'T." The questions were either general knowledge or based on the couple's personal/public lives.
If the player correctly guessed whether his/her spouse would or would not answer correctly, the team would score the wagered points; otherwise, the wagered points would be awarded to the opposing team. The first team to reach 300 points won the game and advanced to the "Preference Round."
Preference Round.
In the "Preference Round," the object was for each member of the team to guess how his/her spouse would answer a question. The host posed a question and three possible answers; each time the couple agreed on the response, the team won another prize for their designated audience member.

Ikazuchi-class destroyer escort

The was a destroyer escort (or frigate) class built for the (later Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, JMSDF) in the late 1950s.
In the FY1953, the Japanese government ordered three destroyer escorts, and this class. These vessels were the first indigenous post-World War II Japanese destroyer escorts, but their propulsion systems were different because the JMSDF tried to find the best way in the propulsion systems of future surface combatants. "Akebono" was a steam-powered vessel, but this class was diesel-powered vessels.
So equipment of this class were almost the same as those of "Akebono", with two American 3"/50 caliber Mark 21 guns (or Type 54, the Japanese version) with two Mark 22 single mounts controlled by Mark 51 director each, two Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns in a dual mount, a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and eight K-gun depth charge throwers. And in 1959, all Mark 21 guns were replaced by Mark 22 rapid-fire guns with Mark 34 single mounts and Mark 63 GFCS was introduced in exchange of the reduction of Bofors 40 mm guns.
This class had a twin-shaft machinery installation with two diesel engines (6,000ps each). This propulsion system was less powerful than the steam turbine machinery of "Akebono", but it was able to propel the ship at a top speed of still. The JMSDF appreciated the lower cost of maintenance of machinery of this class, so every Japanese destroyer escorts adopted diesel propulsion system until the period of gas turbine powered vessels.

Pakistan men's national field hockey team

The Pakistan men's national field hockey team () represents Pakistan in international field hockey. Having played its first match in 1948, it is administered by the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), the governing body for hockey in Pakistan. It has been a member of the International Hockey Federation (FIH) since 1948 and was founding member of the Asian Hockey Federation (ASHF), which was formed in 1958.
Pakistan is one of the most successful national field hockey teams in the world with a record four Hockey World Cup wins (in 1971, 1978, 1982, and 1994).
Pakistan national team has played in all FIH World Cup editions with the only absence coming in 2014 and 2023. The Green Shirts are also the most successful national team in the Asian Games, with eight gold medals: 1958, 1962, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1990, and 2010, the highest number of times a country has become Asian Champion, and the only Asian team to have won the prestigious Champions Trophy thrice: 1978, 1980 and 1994. Pakistan has won a total of 29 official international titles to professional and grassroots level selections, with three gold medals in the Olympic Games field hockey tournaments: in Rome 1960, Mexico City 1968, and Los Angeles 1984.
Field hockey is the national sport of the country. The Pakistan national team has been ranked as the #1 team in the world in both 2000 and 2001 by the FIH. Former captain Sohail Abbas has the second the most international goals scored by a player in the history of international field hockey. Waseem Ahmad is the most-capped player for the team, having played 410 times between 1996 and 2013.

They have competed against one another in 20 major tournaments finals so far, out of which Pakistan has won 13 titles in total. Pakistan have a record of consecutively winning the first three championships of Hockey Asia Cup in 1982, 1985 and 1989 against India. Pakistan also has notable competitive rivalries with Netherlands and Australia.
Pakistan's home ground is National Hockey Stadium in Lahore. The current team's head coach is Shahnaz Sheikh and the team manager is Saeed Khan.
History.
Early history (1948–1955).
Originally, the game had been brought by British servicemen to British India, and like cricket it soon became a popular sport with the local population. Following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, soon after the Pakistan Hockey Federation came into being in 1948. Prior to the partition of India, players playing for Pakistan competed for the Indian side. The Federation soon established and organized the Provincial Hockey/Sports Associations of West Punjab, East Bengal, Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Bahawalpur &amp; Services Sports Board. Despite the limited resources available on 2 August 1948, Pakistan national team, led by Ali Iqtidar Shah Dara, officially went on to play their first international game against Belgium winning the game 2–1 at the 1948 London Olympics. Pakistan remained unbeaten defeating the Netherlands, Denmark and France during the group stage round and ended up placing fourth. During the group stages Pakistan defeat of Netherlands by 6–1 was the highlight for the team. Following the Olympics Pakistan went on a tour of Europe where the played Belgium, Netherlands and Italy and remained undefeated during the tour.
The next international outing of the team came after a gap of two years when Pakistan participated in an invitational competition in Spain in 1950. Pakistan were declared joined winners with Netherlands after the final ended in a draw and organizers decided to end the game rather than going for a deciding period of play, this was Pakistan's first international tournament victory. Again there was a gap of two years before Pakistan again appeared in an international event and this time it was the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki. Pakistan won the first knock-out game against France 6–0 but lost to Netherlands and Great Britain to again finish fourth at the event. Over the four years Pakistan made tours to European teams and also hosted them in their own country and in Asia Pakistan particularly made regular tours to Malaysia and Singapore with whom they played quite a few times.
Rise in Olympics and Asian honors (1956–1970).
Pakistan won their first Olympic medal in 1956 at Melbourne when they reached the final but lost to India 1–0 to earn a silver medal, first podium finish this was also Pakistan's first medal at the Olympics. Field hockey was included in the Asian Games for the first time in 1958 at Tokyo. Pakistan were drawn against Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and archrivals India. They beat Japan 5–0 in their first match, then followed two consecutive victories over South Korea (8–0) and Malaysia (6–0). In the last match Pakistan drew 0–0 with India finishing top of the table in the round-robin format and clinched its first gold medal in an international competition.
In 1960 Rome Olympics where Pakistan played against in a group with Australia, Poland and Japan, winning all the matches. Pakistan then played the quarter-final round with Germany, winning the match 2–1 and advanced to the semi-final round where they defeated Spain. Pakistan eventually won the gold medal, defeating India 1–0 with a goal by Naseer Bunda in the final round held at the Olympic Velodrome and ended India's run of six successive gold medals at the Summer Olympic Games.
In the 1962 Asian Games, Pakistan earned its second gold medal with Chaudhry Ghulam Rasool as the captain leading the team to another successive award. However, during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics the national team ended up as runners-up for the second time after losing 1–0 to India in the final as well as finishing runners-up in the 1966 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand. 
Pakistan won its second Olympic Games gold medal in Mexico at the 1968 Summer Olympics. It fielded what has since then often been considered the best hockey squad ever led by captain Tariq Aziz with Saeed Anwar, Khalid Mahmood, Gulraiz Akhtar and Tariq Niazi. Even though Rasool had retired, this team was still a force to be reckoned with. They won all six of their games—against Kenya, Great Britain, Malaysia, Australia, France and the Netherlands during group play, and against West Germany in the knockout round. Pakistan made the final for the fourth straight Olympics, and won the gold medal, as they had in 1960, this time by defeating Australia, 2–1 with goals from Muhammad Asad Malik and Abdul Rashid. Rashid was the top scorer for Pakistan with seven goals; Tanvir Dar finished with six goals.
The Golden Era (1970–1984).
In the group stage of the 1970 Asian Games, Pakistan was competing with tournament hosts Thailand and contenders Japan for top spot and a place in the finals. In their first match of the group, Pakistan scored thrice against Japan to clinch their first win, followed by defeating Hong Kong 10–0 to go to the top of the group. The team then draw 0–0 with Thailand and progressed to the knock-out round, where they won 5–0 over Malaysia. In the final, Pakistan faced India, winning 1–0 and sealing their third Asian Games gold medal.
In 1971, the first-ever Hockey World Cup was to be hosted by Pakistan. However, political issues would prevent that first competition from being played in Pakistan. The FIH had inadvertently scheduled the first World Cup to be played in Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Furthermore, Pakistan and India had been at war with each other only six years earlier. When Pakistan invited India to compete in the tournament, a crisis arose. Pakistanis, led by cricketer Abdul Hafeez Kardar, protested against India's participation in the Hockey World Cup. Given the intense political climate between Pakistan and India, the FIH decided to move the tournament elsewhere. In March 1971, coincidentally in the same month Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan, the FIH decided to move the first Hockey World Cup to the Real Club de Polo grounds in Barcelona, Spain, which was considered a neutral and peaceful European site. On 27 March 1971, in Brussels, the trophy was formally handed to FIH President Rene Frank by H.E Masood, the Pakistani Ambassador to Belgium. A total number of 10 teams qualified for the event and were broken up into two groups.
The Pakistani team was drawn in a group with hosts Spain, Australia, Japan and the Netherlands. The group was topped by Spain and Pakistan respectively, and both the teams advanced into the semi-finals. In the first semi-final of the tournament Pakistan ousted India 2–1 in a tense and closely contested game and in the second semi-final Spain played safe and defeated a spirited Kenya 1–0 to enter the finals against Pakistan. In the final Pakistan scored early but then strengthened its defense to hold out for a 1–0 victory and win the first hockey World Cup, retaining its number one position in the world hockey rankings, closely followed by India and the Netherlands. Tanvir Dar finished as the top goal scorer at the tournament with eight goals.
The 1972 Munich Olympics, Pakistan lost the final to hosts West Germany losing the game 1–0 with a goal by Michael Krause and finished at fourth place, the following year, in the 1973 Hockey World Cup. The national team made a comeback in the international competition, by winning and retaining their title at the 1974 Asian Games but lost to their rivals India in the finals of the third hockey World Cup in 1975. 1976 Montreal Olympics saw the team secure their first bronze medal in the competition.
The year 1978 saw Pakistan national team win three major international tournaments: the third Hockey World Cup held at Buenos Aires, Argentina along with 1978 Asian Games and the first Champions Trophy. This was the first time a national team won three major titles in the history of international field hockey. In 1980, Pakistan Olympic Association, along with 65 countries, boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This resulted in Pakistan hockey team not participating at the field hockey competition at the tournament. Pakistan hosted the 1980 and 1981 Champions Trophy tournaments, winning the title against West Germany in the final round in 1980 and finishing at fourth position a year later, held at the Hockey Club of Pakistan, Karachi. In the 1980s Pakistan won every international tournament it participated in including the 1982 World Cup in Mumbai and the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles where Pakistan won the gold medal defeating West Germany in the final. Pakistan also won the Asian Games and Asia Cup consecutively in this period.
Surface change crisis and resurgence (1986–1996).
Although hockey was being played at synthetic surfaces from the 1970s but it was only until the 1986 World Cup in London the FIH completely moved on from grass pitches to AstroTurf, synthetic turf made from plastic fibers to give a grass like look. The change of surface made the game much more fasted paced and to align the game with the new conditions the governing body vastly changed the rules of the game which focused more on strength and pace rather than stick work and technique which was the hallmark of Asian style of hockey. This negatively effected Pakistan since they couldn't replace all of the grass pitches with more expensive synthetic surfaces compared to more affluent European nations. This resulted in Pakistan performing very poorly at the World Cup in London where they won just one pool game and finished second last at 11th place. Pakistan however managed to cope up with the new changes in the game in the following years and started to regain some of its past dominance. Pakistan first finished runner-up at the 1990 World Cup at home in Lahore after losing the final to Netherlands and won a bronze medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. The most glorious highlight of the decade came in 1994 when Pakistan first won the 1994 Champions Trophy at home ground, their first title in the competition after 14 years and later in the year Pakistan won the Hockey World Cup in Sydney after winning a penalty shootout against Netherlands.
Post-Atlanta Olympics (1998–2006).
After Atlanta 1996 the first major competition was the 1998 Hockey World Cup in Utrecht Pakistan finished 5th at the tournament. The following year Pakistan won the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup for the first time in 1999. Pakistan finished fourth at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney after losing the bronze medal match to Australia, this was the last time Pakistan played for a medal at the Olympics. Pakistan finished 5th at 2002 World Cup and Kuala Lumpur and won bronze medal at the Champions Trophy the same year. At the 2002 Asian Games Pakistan finished fourth, the first time the team didn't won a medal at the competition. In 2003 Pakistan lost the Hockey Asia Cup final to India and in 2004 Pakistan had a busy schedule where they played in many tournaments in lead up to the Olympics but Pakistan finished 5th at the 2004 Athens Olympics later in December Pakistan finished third at the 2004 Champions Trophy in Lahore, the third consecutive bronze medal. In 2005 Pakistan had a highlight when they defeated Olympic champion Australia to win the 2005 Hockey RaboTrophy in Netherlands. Pakistan finished 6th the 2006 World Cup and failed even to progress from the pool stages of the 2007 Asia Cup.
Beijing Olympics and competitive decline (2008–2012).
The 2008 Beijing Olympics proved to be the worst performance of the team at the event where they finished 8th. The year 2010 started with another record worst performance at the 2010 World Cup in New Delhi where the team finished last at 12th place but later in the same year Pakistan had a major success by winning the gold medal at the 2010 Asian Games in China. In 2011 Pakistan played in many minor tournaments in lead up to the 2012 Olympics where they finished 7th. Later in the year 2012 Pakistan won bronze medal at the 2012 Champions Trophy in Melbourne after upsetting tournaments favorites like Germany. The Pakistani national team most successful tournament, in this period, was the Asian Hockey Champions Trophy winning the trophy first in 2012 against India and finishing as runners-up in the first edition of Asian Hockey Champions Trophy in 2011. During this period despite not any major team honor won the Pakistan team had world renowned individual players in world hockey in the likes of Sohail Abbas who remained top scorer at the 2002 World Cup and 2004 Olympics, he later broke the record of highest goalscorer in international hockey with a total of 348 goals and Rehan Butt who was twice voted as the Best Asian Player by Asian Hockey Federation, Shakeel Abbasi, Salman Akbar and Muhammad Saqlain.
World Cup and Olympic absentee (2013–2020).
Pakistan, after having failed to get a direct entrance for the 2014 World Cup, were handed a last chance to qualify for the event by winning the 2013 Asia Cup, but they finished third and failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in their history. Pakistan failed to qualify for the Olympics for the first time at Rio 2016 after failing a qualification berth at the 2014–15 FIH Hockey World League. From 2016 to 2017, Pakistan performed poorly in different competitions even featuring a record 9–1 defeat against Australia in 2017. In 2018, Roelant Oltmans of Netherlands was brought in as coach and the team showed some improvement, but still performed poorly at the 2018 World Cup, failing to win a single match. Pakistan again failed to qualify for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, losing the Olympic Qualifiers against Netherlands over a two-legged tie in 2019.
Continued struggles and Olympic absentee (2021–present).
PHF announced Pakistan's participation for the 2021 Asian Champions Trophy, the team's first appearance in an international competition after a gap of two years. A 20-man squad was announced with Siegfried Aikman as head coach prior to the tournament. Pakistan could not qualify for the 2023 World Cup despite it being a 16-team event. Pakistan then played 2022 Common wealth games where Pakistan performs poorly and finished 7th, In December 2022 Pakistan participated in 2022 Nations cup were Pakistan finished 7th, In July 2023 Shahnaz Sheikh was appointed as the head coach of team for 2023 Asian Champions Trophy, In August 2023 PHF announced 36-man squad for Asian Games 2023, In the Asian Games 2023 Pakistan lost to India by 10-2 which was the biggest defeat in their history, Pakistan finished 5th in the Asian Games 2023.Pakistan also failed to qualify for the 2024 Summer Olympics, In 2024 Roelant Oltmans was bring as coach of Pakistan for the 2024 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup and the 2024 Nations Cup. 
In July 2025, Pakistan's under-18 team suffered a 3-0 defeat to Japan in the final of the Men's U-18 Asia Cup, held at the National Hockey Training Centre. Despite early aggression and multiple penalty corners, Pakistan failed to convert key chances. The loss underscored the systemic decline in the sport, widely attributed to chronic government neglect, lack of investment in grassroots development, and poor institutional support. Critics argue that such defeats are symptomatic of a broader national apathy toward sports excellence.
Logo and stadium.
The motif of the Pakistan national field hockey team has a star and crescent on a dark green field; with a vertical white stripe at the hoist, usually in green, white color, as represented in the flag of Pakistan.
Pakistan played at a number of different venues across the country, though by 1978, this had largely settled down to having National Hockey Stadium (also known as Gaddafi Hockey Stadium, named after former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi) in Lahore as the primary venue, with Faisalabad Hockey Stadium and the Hockey Club of Pakistan used on occasions where the National Hockey Stadium was unavailable for home matches. The stadium is considered to be the biggest international field hockey stadium in the world, and holds a capacity of 45,000 spectators.
The Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) has its headquarters at the stadium. Pakistan has hosted many international matches and competitions such as the Hockey Asia Cup of 1982 and Champions Trophy tournament in 1978, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1992, 1994, 1998, and 2004 along with the 1990 Hockey World Cup, where Pakistan lost 3–1 to the Netherlands in the final.

Lambert I of Spoleto

Lambert I (died 880) was the duke and margrave ("dux et marchio") of Spoleto on two occasions, first from 859 to 871 and then from 876 to his death.
Lambert was the eldest son of Guy I of Spoleto and Itta, daughter of Sico of Benevento. He married Judith, daughter of Eberhard of Friuli.
In his first year of rule, he joined Gerard, count of the Marsi; Maielpoto, gastald of Telese; and Wandelbert, gastald of Boiano, to prevent Sawdan, the Saracen emir of Bari, from reentering his city after a campaign against Capua and the Lavorno. Despite a bloody battle, he successfully entered Bari.
In April 860, Lambert joined with Hildebert, count of Camerino, in rebelling against the Emperor Louis II. Chased by an imperial army into the Marsi, from there they fled to Benevento and took refuge under Prince Adelchis. Louis surrounded the city and pardoned both Lambert and his protector in return for their loyalty. Hildebert, however, fled further to Bari.
In 866, Louis unsuccessfully besieged Landulf II, the count-bishop of Capua. He even granted Lambert the county of Capua to continue the siege. At that moment, the duchy of Spoleto had reached its greatest extent.
Lambert left the siege of Capua and went Rome after the election of Adrian II on 13 November 867. On 13 December, Lambert plundered Rome during the papal coronation ceremony. He was promptly excommunicated and, as the emperor supported Adrian's pontificate, lost the patronage of Louis. It was three years before he rebelled a second time, though. In 871, after the emperor greatly increased his power and prestige by capturing Bari, Lambert allied with Guaifer of Salerno, Sergius II of Naples, and Adelchis of Benevento and entered into open revolt against the emperor. The Saracens, however, landed new forces and attacked Salerno. Adelchis, who had imprisoned the emperor while Lambert was staying in Benevento, released his captive to lead the forces against the infidels. The free emperor immediately deposed Lambert from his imperial position and replaced him with Suppo III, a cousin of his wife Engelberga.
Louis returned to the Mezzogiorno in 873, the pope having absolved him from the oaths he had sworn to Adelchis in return for liberty. He besieged Benevento, but failed to take Lambert. After his death, he was replaced as emperor by his uncle Charles the Bald, who reappointed Lambert to his old post in Spoleto (February or June 876). He also appointed Lambert's younger brother Guy as margrave of Camerino with the job of protecting the pope. On 16 July, at Ponthion, Charles confirmed the donation of a large part of Spoletan territory to the papacy, but Lambert was still the most powerful lord in the central peninsula and a practically independent prince.
In 877, Charles died and Lambert supported Carloman of Bavaria over Charles' heir, Louis the Stammerer, for the kingship of Italy and the emperorship. Lambert himself entered Rome with the intent of making himself king, but was dissuaded by Pope John VIII. In March 878, Lambert and Adalbert I of Tuscany forced the populace to acknowledge Carloman as king. The two then besieged the pope in the Leonine City for thirty days and John fled Rome for Troyes. At Troyes, he held a synod in which he offered to crown Louis the Stammerer emperor, adopted Boso of Arles as his son, and excommunicated his Italian enemies (Lambert and Adalbert). The pope even accused Lambert of desiring the imperial crown for himself, which is probable considering the subsequent history of his dynasty.
Lambert returned his sights to Capua after this Roman episode. He died besieging that city in 880. He was succeeded by his son Guy II. His brother Guy became king and emperor, as did his nephew and namesake Lambert II. The Archbishop of Rheims Fulk the Venerable, cautioned Lambert II against following his eponymous uncle's example.

A Single Woman (play)

A Single Woman is a play based on the life of Jeannette Rankin, the first woman in the United States Congress. First drafted as a one-woman show by Nevada Shakespeare Company founding Artistic Director, Jeanmarie Simpson, it developed into a "duet performance work" by the time it premiered at the Oats Park Art Center in Fallon, Nevada on February 7, 2004.
The play subsequently toured internationally with hundreds of grassroots including a 4-week run at The Culture Project Off-Broadway in the summer of 2005. The play closed at the Invisible Theatre in Tucson, Arizona on November 5, 2006.
Artists.
In addition to being a theatre artist, Simpson, the author and performer of the title role, is a peace activist. Many performances of the play have been fundraisers for individual branches and the national office of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), in addition to hundreds of other peace and justice organizations including United Methodist Church's Social Justice and Global Ministries, Jews for Peace, Planned Parenthood, American Civil Liberties Union, Veterans for Peace, American Friends Service Committee and many others.
Simpson directed the production in New York, initially with Claudia Schneider and "Les Misérables" veteran, Neal Mayer, in the roles. Midway through, Simpson stepped in and completed the run as Rankin.

Crosstrees

Crosstrees are the two horizontal spars at the upper ends of the topmasts of sailing ships that are used to anchor the shrouds from the topgallant mast. They may also be mounted at the upper end of the topgallant to anchor the shrouds from the royal mast (if fitted). Similar transverse spars remain on steamship and motor vessel masts to secure wire antennae or signal flag halyards. In modern sailing vessels, spreaders serve the same purpose. 
Explanation.
Any vertical structure like a mast is subject to dynamic swaying stress from wind, which levers immense force at the base of the mast. Such stress is countered through guy ropes which are diagonally supporting ropes from mast top to its base. These ropes share the load on the mast tops and communicate that force to the base structure.
The taller the mast, the wider a base is required for the guy-wires so as to form an appropriate angular support against the sway the mast is exposed to, yet ships are fixed in their beam (width) and hence only a limited angle is possible for the guy-ropes to support very high masts. Thereby, the taller the ship's mast, the more narrow and unfeasible would be the angle between its support wires and its top. This is where a simple innovation like the crosstree helps to overcome such limitation. 
The crosstree serves as a fresh base to spread the next level of supporting guy ropes, thereby providing a stable height extension to the masts. Without the crosstree, the ship's mast would have been severely limited in height, in relation to the beam of the ship. 
Each crosstree serves to spread another level of holding ropes on a fresh wider spar so as to provide support to the next mast top section. Effectively, the crosstree allows to extend the height, mount yet another layer of sail shrouds and option more wind power to the ships. The crosstree also serves to spread the shroud tops.

Peaceful World (album)

Peaceful World is the eighth studio album (a double-LP) by the American rock band The Rascals, released on May 5, 1971. It peaked at number 122 on the "Billboard" 200 chart. In Canada, the album reached number 50. The single "Love Me" reached number 95 on the "Billboard" Hot 100.
History.
Vocalist Eddie Brigati left the Rascals in August 1970, with guitarist Gene Cornish leaving the following month. By October, a new lineup of the Rascals was assembled featuring original members Felix Cavaliere (vocals/keyboards) and Dino Danelli (drums), and several new players, including ex-Paul Butterfield Blues Band guitarist Buzz Feiten and vocalist Annie Sutton. "Peaceful World" was the first album featuring this new version of the band. It was also the Rascals' first album for the CBS/Columbia label, after almost six years with Atlantic Records.
Many of the songs on "Peaceful World" were jazz-influenced, as opposed to the "blue-eyed soul" style of the Rascals' heyday; the title track, in particular, was a long piece featuring improvisation and multiple extended solos.
"Peaceful World" was reissued along with "The Island of Real" on the BGO label in 2008.
Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, critic Jim Newsom praised the album and wrote "Peaceful World" was "a wonderful blend of soul, jazz, and funk that never found an audience.. Despite its lack of commercial success, this was an artistic triumph for Felix Cavaliere... his ambitious album took the Rascals to the place Cavaliere had been headed over the course of the last couple of albums—but, sadly, the fans didn't follow." Robert Christgau admired the change of direction the album took to jazz, but also wrote; "Yet in the end the jazz musicians he's signed on—Fathead Newman, Joe Farrell, Pepper Adams, Ron Carter—aren't especially well-suited to popularize Coltrane and Pharoah and Sun Ra. And even if Felix were singing enough, he wouldn't be singing very good stuff—composition has never been his strength..."
In his review for the reissue of "Peaceful World/The Island of Real", critic Thom Jurek wrote of the album " Peaceful World is a sprawling yet very focused collection of songs... The remarkable aspect of this gorgeous record is that it sounds vintage but not dated. The production is clean, the funk is in the cut, and the communication between musicians in the charts is tight."

Odd Fellows Hall (Covington, Kentucky)

The Odd Fellows Hall in Covington, Kentucky is located at the northeast corner of Fifth Street and Madison Avenue. It was constructed in 1856 by the Independent Order of Odd Fellows Lodge, and was the center of Covington's civic and political life for most of the Victorian era. When the American Civil War ended, victorious Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was honored with a reception there.
In 1900, the body of William Goebel, the only U.S. governor to be assassinated in office, lay in state there, as an estimated 10,000 people filed past.
In the 1950s, a roller skating rink filled the second-floor ballroom, famous for its -high ceiling suspended by a truss system.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It was deemed notable as "one of the city's earliest commercial structures." The building was assessed to be "especially noteworthy in the method of construction. In order to accommodate large, unbroken interior spaces, iron tie rods were employed to support the floors. In addition to its architectural distinction, the structure is a well-known local landmark having served as the center for both civic and social activities in downtown Covington."
In May 2002, a major fire almost destroyed the entire building. It was reduced to its front facade, back wall, and a three-story column of smoke and charred debris. A new team has restored the hall, with its first tenant taking occupancy in March 2006.

Alabama Wildlife Center

The Alabama Wildlife Center (AWC) is a wildlife rehabilitation and education center located in Oak Mountain State Park in Pelham, Alabama, United States. It is the largest and oldest rehabilitation center in the state. The Alabama Wildlife Center is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. While being located within Oak Mountain State Park, the Alabama Wildlife Center operates independently and is not part of the state park system.
The Alabama Wildlife Center (AWC) is dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation, and release of native wild birds across Alabama, serving over 100 species. Each year, the AWC cares for nearly 2,000 avian patients, showcasing its commitment to preserving the state's avian biodiversity.
The educational initiatives of the Alabama Wildlife Center (AWC) are crafted to foster an understanding of our integral role within ecosystems, highlighting how our actions impact other species and the environment. These programs aim to forge a bond between Alabamians and the state's wild birds, emphasizing the importance of conservation. Annually, AWC conducts over 500 events to educate the public about native wild birds and the significance of wildlife conservation efforts.
The Alabama Wildlife Center is open to the public throughout the year, offering a self-guided tour experience for visitors.
Mission.
The Alabama Wildlife Center is dedicated to the protection, preservation, and conservation of Alabama's native avian species through rehabilitation and education initiatives.
Vision.
The Alabama Wildlife Center's vision is to create a thriving ecosystem where Alabama's native wildlife flourishes, and is supported by an engaged and educated community that champions sustainability, biodiversity, and the conservation of wildlife for future generations.
History.
Founded in 1977 by Anne Miller, the Alabama Wildlife Center originally began as a small, volunteer-run, and home-based organization. Since its founding, AWC has grown into Alabama's largest rehabilitation center. In 1980, AWC was formally established as a nonprofit organization in Alabama, and by 1981, it had achieved its status as a 501(c) nonprofit. Historically, the AWC has provided care for more than 2,000 animals annually. This care encompassed a broad spectrum of species, including mammals such as foxes, deer, and bats; reptiles such as turtles and alligators; and a diverse array of birds, from raptors to songbirds. In 1987, the Alabama Wildlife Center relocated to Oak Mountain State Park, taking up residence in the space formerly occupied by the Foothills Restaurant. This move marked a new chapter in the center's history, enhancing its ability to serve Alabama's wildlife.
Responding to the rising challenges affecting wild bird populations, the Alabama Wildlife Center now exclusively dedicates its efforts to the preservation and care of Alabama's native wild birds. AWC stands out as one of only three facilities in Alabama licensed to care for federally protected and migratory bird species - underscoring its critical role in wildlife conservation.
Treetop Nature Trail Boardwalk.
The Treetop Nature Trail serves as a scenic connector between the Alabama Wildlife Center and the Treetop Nature Trail Boardwalk, offering a brief yet immersive quarter-mile hike through the heart of Alabama's natural beauty. For those who prefer not to hike, a convenient 2-minute drive offers an alternative route. This Boardwalk is home to native Alabama birds of prey rehabilitated by the AWC. Unfortunately, due to their injuries, these birds are unable to return to the wild, now serving as educational ambassadors. Treetop Nature Trail Boardwalk includes 6 enclosures each with each species of bird and their story.

Herdsmen of the Sun

Herdsmen of the Sun () is a 1989 documentary film by Werner Herzog.
The film explores the social rituals and cultural celebrations of the Saharan nomadic Wodaabe tribe. Particular focus is given to the Gerewol celebration, which features an elaborate male beauty contest to win wives.
Although the film may be considered to be ethnographic, Herzog commented that: "[My films] are anthropological only in as much as they try to explore the human condition at this particular time on this planet. I do not make films using images only of clouds and trees, I work with human beings because the way they function in different cultural groups interests me. If that makes me an anthropologist then so be it."

Static wick

Static wicks, also called static dischargers or static discharge wicks, are devices used to remove static electricity from aircraft in flight. They take the form of small sticks pointing backwards from the wings, and are fitted on almost all civilian aircraft.
Function.
Precipitation static is an electrical charge on an airplane caused by flying through rain, snow storms, ice, or dust particles. Charge also accumulates through friction between the aircraft hull and the air. When the aircraft charge is great enough, it discharges into the surrounding air. Without static dischargers, the charge discharges in large batches through pointed aircraft extremities, such as antennas, wing tips, vertical and horizontal stabilizers, and other protrusions. The discharge creates a broad-band radio frequency noise from DC to 1000 MHz, which can affect aircraft communication.
To control this discharge, so as to allow the continuous operation of navigation and radio communication systems, static wicks are installed on the trailing edges of aircraft. These include (electrically grounded) ailerons, elevators, rudder, wing, horizontal and vertical stabilizer tips. Static wicks are high electrical resistance (6–200 megaohm) devices with a lower corona voltage and sharper points than the surrounding aircraft structure. This means that the corona discharge into the atmosphere flows through them, and occurs gradually. 
Static wicks are not lightning arresters and do not affect the likelihood of an aircraft being struck by lightning. They will not function if they are not properly bonded to the aircraft. There must be a conductive path from all parts of the airplane to the dischargers, otherwise they will be useless. Access panels, doors, cowls, navigation lights, antenna mounting hardware, control surfaces, etc., can create static noise if they cannot discharge through the static wick.
History.
Static dischargers were first proposed in a patent application by Howard Dudley Blanchard in 1920. At this time most aircraft were constructed from cloth and wood, and rigid body airships were widely used. Therefore, a method of gradually discharging static accumulation was necessary since static discharge on these craft could cause serious damage and start fires. Static discharge is the likely cause of the Hindenburg disaster. 
The first static wicks were developed by a joint Army-Navy team led by Dr. Ross Gunn of the Naval Research Laboratory and fitted onto military aircraft during World War II. They were shown to be effective even in extreme weather conditions in 1946 by a United States Army Air Corps team led by Capt. Ernest Lynn Cleveland. 
Dayton Granger, an inventor from Florida, received a patent on static wicks in 1950.

Freedom and Unity

"Freedom and Unity" is the official motto of the U.S. state of Vermont. The motto was first adopted in 1788 for use on the Great Seal of the Vermont Republic. Ira Allen designed the Vermont seal and is often credited as its author. Allen's 1798 book "The Natural and Political History of the State of Vermont" cites many contributions by him to Vermont's founding but does not claim credit for the motto. Following Vermont's admission to the federal union in 1791, the legislature once more approved the use of the motto for the new "state" seal. Vermont's first governor, Thomas Chittenden, cited the state motto in his epitaph: "Out of storm and manifold perils rose an enduring state, the home of freedom and unity."
Meaning.
There is general agreement that Vermont's motto is about the idea of balancing two seemingly opposite ideals: the personal freedom and independence of the individual citizen, with the common good of the larger community. Writer and Vermont resident Dorothy Canfield Fisher (1879–1958) wrote the following about her adopted state: "the Vermont idea grapples energetically with the basic problem of human conduct – how to reconcile the needs of the group, of which every man or woman is a member, with the craving for individual freedom to be what he really is."
These two forces have mostly endured in Vermont's history, both freedom, and unity, expressing distinct parts of the Vermont identity. Vermont's motto is believed to have been the inspiration for Daniel Webster's famous "Liberty and Union" speech before the United States Senate. Use of the exact motto is found in two quite different political groups. The left-center Social Democratic Party of Germany used the motto Freedom and Unity before World War II. In the United Kingdom, a right-center party, the English Democratic Party (not to be confused with the similarly named English Democrats Party) which seeks protection of English culture and opposing European unity, also uses the exact motto. The current national motto of Germany, adopted by the Federal Republic of Germany in 1952, is also quite similar, """ translating as "Unity and Justice and Freedom". The coat of arms of the Swiss canton of Vaud reads " - freedom and fatherland.
Uses and applications.
By Vermont statute the motto Freedom and Unity is applied to the Great Seal, coat of arms, and flag of Vermont. The motto can be found above the central doors of the Vermont Supreme Court, and above the rostrum in Representatives Hall at the Vermont State House.
Tanzania.
Tanzania's official motto is the Swahili phrase ", which translates as "Freedom and Unity".

Thrift Drug

Thrift Drug was a U.S. pharmacy chain founded in 1935 and based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
History.
In 1935, pharmacists Philip Hoffman and Reuben Helfant came together to form the Thrift Drug Company. Their first stores opened in the Pittsburgh suburb of Sewickley in May, followed by Bellevue two weeks later. A third store was opened later that year, and they finished with $200,000 in sales. They incorporated the company in 1937. 
By 1963, the chain spanned 115 stores across six states. Thrift Drug was purchased by JCPenney in November 1968 for $70 million in stocks. Hoffman died exactly a month later. The chain had 171 stores in 10 states by this point. The company was expanded greatly thereafter, serving as the flagship chain of JCPenney's pharmacy group. 
Thrift Drug established Express Pharmacy Services, a mail order pharmacy, in January 1983. By 1986, the service had grown to four facilities and filled over 1.5 million prescriptions. By 1987, the company operated 400 stores in 18 states. In February 1993, Thrift sold 45 Treasury Drug stores in Georgia to Big B Drugs.
In January 1995, JCPenney announced its Thrift Drug unit would buy Kerr Drug, a 97-store chain in the North and South Carolina. By 1996, Thrift Drug was considered the eighth-largest drugstore chain in the country. In August, JCPenney agreed to acquire the Fay's Drug chain for $285 million. The acquisition added 272 stores in New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and New Hampshire, giving Thrift Drug 926 stores.
In October 1996, Rite Aid announced it would purchase the Thrifty PayLess chain for $2.3 billion. As part of that deal, 200 stores in North and South Carolina were sold to Thrift Drug. The following month, JCPenney announced it would purchase Eckerd and merge it with Thrift Drug. However, the FTC objected to the purchase due to JCPenney's dominant position in the Carolinas. JCPenney was forced to divest 161 stores in the area. These stores were purchased by an investment group led by former Thrift Drug executives, which became the new Kerr Drug chain.
In 1997, JCPenney merged Thrift Drug, and its other pharmacy chains, into Eckerd. JCPenney ultimately sold Eckerd to CVS and Jean Coutu Group in 2004.
Thrift Drug, Inc. remained an active subsidiary of Eckerd and later Rite Aid (owning stores held by the company at its closure), as shown in the latter company's October 2023 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings.
On May 5, 2025, Rite Aid filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in 2 years, listing assets and liabilities between $1 billion and $10 billion. Rite Aid will sell all of its assets as part of its procedure, as it overcomes financial challenges such as debt, increased competition, and inflation, including Thrift Drug. 
In popular culture.
One enduring legacy of Thrift Drug was in the 1977 movie "Slap Shot", when a Thrift Drug located in downtown Johnstown, Pennsylvania was shown in the background during a shot of downtown Charlestown.

Isuzu-class destroyer escort

The "Isuzu"-class destroyer escorts were four destroyer escorts (or frigates) built for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) in the early 1960s. The latter two ("Kitakami" and "Ōi") were quite different from the earlier two vessels in their propulsion and weaponry, so sometimes they were classified as the ""Kitakami" class".
This class was the first JMSDF surface combatant adopted shelter-deck design. Propulsion systems varied in each vessels because the JMSDF tried to find the best way in the propulsion systems of future DEs. The design concept of this class and the CODAD propulsion system of the "Kitakami" class became prototype of them of the latter DEs and DDKs such as and .
The gun system was a scale-down version of the , four 3-inch/50-caliber Mark 22 guns with two Mark 33 dual mounts controlled by a Mark 63 GFCS. Main air-search radar was a OPS-2, Japanese variant of the American AN/SPS-12.
In the earlier batch, the main anti-submarine warfare (ASW) armament was a Mk.108 Weapon Alpha. The JMSDF desired this American brand-new ASW rocket launcher earnestly, but then, it became clear that it was not as good as it was supposed to be. So in the latter batch, it was changed with a , Swedish 375 mm quadruple ASW rocket launcher. Later, the Weapon Alpha of the earlier batch was also replaced by a Type 71, Japanese version of the M/50.

Hakluyt &amp; Company

Hakluyt &amp; Company is a British strategic advisory firm. The company is headquartered in London.
Hakluyt was founded by former officials of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). The company has recruited several former British spies and journalists from "The Financial Times". The name of the company comes from the geographer Richard Hakluyt.
The firm is chaired by Paul Deighton, and the other members of the board include managing partner Thomas Ellis, Paul Dimitruk, Don Viera, and Jean Tomlin. Its head office is in Upper Brook Street, Mayfair. It also has branches on Park Avenue, Manhattan and Raffles Place, Singapore.
Board and personnel.
In 2024, former managing partner Varun Chandra was appointed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer to become his new business and investment adviser. He was succeeded by Thomas Ellis.
Hakluyt's international advisory board is chaired by former British foreign secretary, Lord William Hague. Hague assumed the role in 2024, succeeding Niall FitzGerald, former deputy chairman of Thomson Reuters UK and an adviser to Morgan Stanley. Other board members have included Kieran Prendergast, former Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs at the United Nations; John Rose, former Rolls-Royce chief executive; Robert Webb, former BBC Worldwide chairman; and E. Neville Isdell, former chair of The Coca-Cola Company.
Andrew Mitchell, former UK Secretary of State for International Development, acted as an adviser to Hakluyt.
Hakluyt has established a network of operatives throughout the world who provide it with intelligence on commercial or political issues of interest to its clients. Operatives used by Hakluyt include embassy staff, former spies, reporters, and well connected government and corporate people. 
Hakluyt has strong links with the British intelligence service MI6. The "Evening Standard" wrote in 2012 that "Spies preparing for retirement are approached discreetly in St James's clubs and asked if they would like some lucrative freelance action to top up their pensions".
Hakluyt refused to comment when asked whether former employees of MI6 were required to cut ties with the intelligence agency when recruited to work at Hakluyt.
Activities.
Hakluyt works for large corporations, and has close links with large oil firms. Peter Cazalet, former deputy chairman of BP, helped establish Hakluyt and Peter Holmes, former chairman of Shell, has been president of its foundation. 
Its London office compiles reports provided by its field operatives.
In 2001, "The Sunday Times" reported that oil companies Shell and BP hired Hakluyt to collect information on the environmental group Greenpeace.
In 2012, one of Hakluyt's operatives, Neil Heywood, was found dead in his Chongqing hotel room. Heywood had been close to the local Communist party representative, Bo Xilai, and his wife Gu Kailai. The event became an international incident which included the involvement of then-UK prime minister David Cameron. Gu was in due course convicted of murder and sentenced to death; her sentence was later commuted to 15 years imprisonment. 
In 2023, "Bloomberg" reported that the British Labour Party had "brought in" Hakluyt to help it court the British business community by arranging meetings with prominent business figures. A spokesperson for Hakluyt stated that "we do not work for political parties,” while a Labour spokesperson declined to comment on the association.

Eustace Fiennes

 Sir Eustace Edward Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, 1st Baronet (29 February 1864 – 9 February 1943), known as Sir Eustace Fiennes, was a British soldier, Liberal politician, colonial administrator and sportsman.
Background.
Fiennes was born in Reading, Berkshire, the second son of John Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, 17th Baron Saye and Sele and his wife, Lady Augusta Hay-Drummond, a daughter of the 11th Earl of Kinnoull. He was educated at Malvern College.
In 1894, Fiennes married Florence Agnes Fletcher "née" Rathfelder (from Constantia, Cape Town). They lived in Windlesham and Sunningdale and had two children: John Eustace (1895–1917, Battle of Arras) and Sir Ranulph Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, 2nd Baronet (1902–1943).
Military career.
Fiennes fought in the North-West Rebellion in 1885, was stationed in Egypt from 1888 to 1889, and took part in the expedition to Mashonaland in 1890. He was commissioned into the Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars in 1895, and promoted lieutenant on 29 April 1899. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, Fiennes volunteered for service in South Africa, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Imperial Yeomanry on 3 February 1900, serving in the 40th (Oxfordshire) company of the 10th Battalion. He left London the same day on board the SS Montfort. He was promoted captain in 1901, major in 1905, and lieutenant-colonel in 1918. He fought in Flanders and the Dardanelles during World War I.
Political career.
At the 1906 general election, Fiennes was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Banbury and with a brief interruption in 1910, held the seat until the 1918 general election. He was also Parliamentary Private Secretary to Winston Churchill (then First Lord of the Admiralty) from 1912 to 1914. Created a baronet in 1916, Fiennes left the Commons two years later to become Governor of the Seychelles and was then Governor of the Leeward Islands from 1921 to 1929.
Fiennes died in 1943 aged 78 and his title was inherited by his son who died the same year. His grandson, the famous explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, inherited the title on his birth in 1944. Through his grandfather the 16th Baron Saye and Sele, Fiennes is also related to the actors Ralph and Joseph Fiennes.

Rachitomi

The Rachitomi were a group of extinct Palaeozoic labyrinthodont amphibians, according to an earlier classification system. They are defined by the structure of the vertebrae, having large semi-circular intercentra below the notochord and smaller paired though prominent pleurocentra on each side above and behind, forming anchoring points for the ribs.
This form of complex backbone was found in some crossopterygian fish, the Ichthyostegalia, most Temnospondyli and some Reptiliomorpha. Primitive reptiles kept the complex rachitomous vertebrae, but with the pleurocentra being the more dominant. As a phylogenetic unit, the Rachitomi thus are a paraphyletic unit.

In September 1860, Quincke was one of the participants in the Karlsruhe Congress, the first international conference of chemistry worldwide. He and Adolf von Baeyer represented the University of Berlin in Congress.
Quincke also did important work in the experimental study of the reflection of light, especially from metallic surfaces, and carried on prolonged researches on the subject of the influence of electric forces upon the constants of different forms of matter, modifying the dissociation hypothesis of Clausius.
 is an apparatus that Quincke built in 1866 which demonstrates destructive interference of sound waves. It is also known as the Herschel-Quincke Tube; John Herschel had proposed a similar apparatus, but did not build it. The principles of the apparatus are now applied in mufflers and other noise management devices. 
Quincke received a DCL from Oxford and an LL.D. from Cambridge and from Glasgow and was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1885 he published "Geschichte des physikalischen Instituts der Universität Heidelberg". He was elected to honorary membership of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society on 26 april 1892.
Quincke died in Heidelberg at the age of 89 years. He is believed to be the last living participant of the Karlsruhe Congress.

Nicky Walker

Joseph Nicol Walker (born 29 September 1962) is a Scottish former professional footballer, who played as a goalkeeper for several clubs in Scotland and England. Walker was selected for many Scotland squads during the 1990s, earning two international caps.
Football career.
Club.
A product of Highland League club Elgin City, Walker signed for Leicester City aged 17. He didn't settle in the Midlands though, and returned to Scotland within the year, signing for Motherwell in 1981. Two years later he signed for Rangers, where he soon established himself as their first choice goalkeeper. The arrival of Chris Woods as part of the Souness revolution meant that Walker lost his place. Walker did play in the 1987 Scottish League Cup Final against Aberdeen, which Rangers won after a penalty shoot-out, while injuries to Woods the following season also meant Walker deputised in twelve games to earn a Scottish League title medal.
Walker joined Heart of Midlothian in a £125,000 deal in 1990. His time at Tynecastle developed into a see-saw battle with Henry Smith for the starting goalkeeping role, both men earning international recognition when in the Hearts first team but enduring significant spells on the sidelines. Smith eventually won the duel and, after a loan spell with Burnley, Walker moved to Partick Thistle in 1994 in a part-exchange deal for Craig Nelson.
Firhill proved a happy home for Walker, and he enjoyed his most consistent period in the West of Glasgow. When Thistle were relegated in 1996, his form was sufficient to earn a £60,000 move to high-flying Aberdeen. He left Pittodrie in 1999 after he was supplanted by Derek Stillie, winding down his career with short spells at Ross County and Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
International.
Walker earned two international caps for Scotland, making his debut in a 1–0 defeat by Germany in 1993. His only other appearance was three years later, against the United States. Walker was selected as a reserve goalkeeper in the Scotland squad for UEFA Euro 1996.
Personal life.
Walker's family company is Walkers Shortbread, based in the Speyside village of Aberlour, Morayshire, in north east Scotland. He joined the firm following his retirement from football, becoming a director.

Back to the Bars

Back to the Bars is a live album by rock musician Todd Rundgren, which was released as a double LP in 1978.
The album was recorded during week-long stints in New York City (The Bottom Line), Los Angeles (The Roxy), and Cleveland (The Agora). The music featured the best of Rundgren's most commercial work spanning seven of the eight solo albums released in the 1970s up to, but not including, his most recent at the time. This effort was in place of rumors of a re-release of his out-of-print first two LPs, "Runt", and "Runt. The Ballad of Todd Rundgren". The only offering from those were "The Range War", and the bulk of the material came from Something/Anything?, A Wizard, a True Star, Todd, Initiation, and Faithful. The finale included past and present members of Rundgren's Utopia: Roger Powell, Kasim Sulton, Willie Wilcox, John Siegler, Ralph Schuckett and Moogy Klingman. Also joining in were the Hello People: Norman Smart, Greg Geddes, Bobby Sedita, and Larry Tasse. Special guest stars were Rick Derringer, Spencer Davis, Daryl Hall, John Oates, and Stevie Nicks.
Despite a hard push to replicate the success of "Frampton Comes Alive!", "Back to the Bars" did not generate any significant singles or lift for Rundgren.

Philip Margetson

Major Sir Philip Reginald Margetson (2 January 1894 – 5 December 1985) was an Assistant Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police.
Military service.
Margetson was educated at Marlborough and then went on to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In 1915 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Royal Scots Fusiliers. He was promoted lieutenant on 25 December 1915, and temporary captain on 20 February 1916. He reverted to Lieutenant on 27 April 1916. In the 1916 King's Birthday Honours he was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry in action. In January 1918 he became an instructor with an officer cadet unit as an Acting Captain. In 1919 he became second-in-command of the 1/4th Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers (Territorial Force) (which was then part of the Army of Occupation) in the rank of Acting Major. On 1 January 1923 he was finally promoted to the substantive rank of captain, while serving as adjutant of the 1st Battalion. On 1 October 1928 he became Staff Captain of the 54th (East Anglian) Division, an appointment he held until 1 October 1932. On 1 January 1933 he became a Brevet Major.
Police career.
On 31 December 1933, Margetson retired from the Army, transferring to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers. He joined the Metropolitan Police, entering directly as a chief inspector and taking the position of senior administrative officer at No.4 District (South London) headquarters on 1 December 1933. He was later promoted to Superintendent and took command of "R" Division (Blackheath). In August 1936 he was promoted to Chief Constable and became deputy commander of No.2 District (North London). In February 1938 he was transferred to the same post in No.1 District (West Central London), and in October 1938 to the same post in No.3 District (East London). In February 1940 he was promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner at "A" Department (Operations and Administration) of Scotland Yard and in August 1940 he was given command of No.1 District. In March 1946 he received the new rank of commander.
In June 1946, he was promoted to Assistant Commissioner "D" (Personnel and Training) and in October he transferred to become Assistant Commissioner "A" (Operations and Administration). In 1950, he applied for the vacant office of Commissioner of the City of London Police. The job went to one of his colleagues, Arthur Young, who had succeeded him as Assistant Commissioner "D".
In 1947 he was made an Officer of the Venerable Order of Saint John. He was created a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 1948 New Year Honours and raised to Knight Commander (KCVO) in the 1953 Coronation Honours. In 1955 he was promoted to Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John. He received the Queen's Police Medal (QPM) for Distinguished Service in the 1956 Queen's Birthday Honours.
Later life.
He retired on 2 January 1957 (his 63rd birthday) and joined the board of Securicor, serving as chairman from 1960 to 1973, when he became honorary president. He was instrumental in the disarming of cash in transit security guards in 1964, having always disliked the idea of private guards carrying firearms.
In 1918, Margetson married Diana Thornycroft, daughter of Sir John Thornycroft. They had two sons; the elder was killed in action in 1943.
The National Portrait Gallery holds two 1957 photographic portraits of Margetson by Elliott &amp; Fry.

Botamochi

 is a wagashi (Japanese confection) made with glutinous rice, white rice (ratio of 7:3, or only glutinous rice), and sweet azuki paste (red bean paste). They are made by soaking the rice for approximately 1 hour. The rice is then cooked, and a thick azuki paste is hand-packed around pre-formed balls of rice. Botamochi is eaten as sacred food as offering during the weeks of the spring and the autumn Higan in Japan.
Another name for this kind of confection is , the origin and meaning of which is a subject of debate, with some saying that ohagi uses a slightly different texture of azuki paste but is otherwise almost identical. It is made in autumn and some recipe variations in both cases call for a coating of soy flour to be applied to the ohagi after the azuki paste.
The two different names are, some people say, derived from the Botan (peony) which blooms in the spring and the Hagi (Japanese bush clover or Lespedeza) which blooms during autumn.
"Botamochi" is the modern name for the dish "kaimochi" (かいもち) mentioned in the Heian period text "Uji Shūi Monogatari" (宇治拾遺物語).
The proverb , literally "a botamochi falls down from a shelf", means "receiving a windfall", "a lucky break".
The term is also used for a specific pattern of Bizen ware with two, three or five round marks, as if the marks of the small balls of rice cakes were left on the plate.

JS Ishikari

JS "Ishikari" (DE-226) was the first destroyer escort with a gas turbine engine and surface-to-surface missiles of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. She is the successor of the earlier . Entering service in 1981, she remained active until 2007 when she was decommissioned.
Design.
At first, this ship was planned to belong to the new ship classification, PCE (Patrol Coastal ships, Escort) to replace small submarine chasers and old destroyer escorts with limited anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capability against new nuclear-powered submarines. But finally, it was decided to change her classification to the ordinary destroyer escort. This class is quite epoch-making for the destroyer escorts of the JMSDF as follows:
The CODOG propulsion system. This was the first ship with the gas turbine engine in the JMSDF. The Rolls-Royce Olympus TM-3B manufactured by the Kawasaki Heavy Industries under license was used for boosting. The cruising engine is the Kawaksaki 6DRV 35/44 diesel engine developed by the Technical Research and Development Institute (TRDI).
The centre-superstructure style. Whereas the JMSDF was inclined to adopt the flush decker style, in this ship, the superstructure is at the center of the ship to save space. This was a very controversial decision, and because of this decision, there has been criticisms about the oceangoing capability of this ship.
The simplified but sufficient C4ISR system was installed aboard the ship. The design was not equipped with air-search radar unlike her predecessors. Alternatively she had the OPS-28 surface search and target acquisition radar which could deal with low-altitude aircraft and missiles. The FCS-2 gun fire-control system also had air-searching capability. As the tactical data processing system, she had the OYQ-5 being capable of receiving data automatically from other ships via Link-14 (STANAG 5514; the data link with the Radioteletype).
The design also had a brand-new weapon systems. The "Ishikari" design was equipped with eight Boeing Harpoon surface-to-surface missiles as the key weapon system whereas traditional Japanese frigates were specialized in anti-submarine warfare. According to this mission concept, its predecessor's Mark 16 GMLS for the ASROC system was removed. A modern Otobreda 76 mm gun replaced its predecessor's older 3-inch gun and automation greatly reduced the number of crew needed.
Construction and history.
The ship was built at the Mitsui Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Tamano office at Tamano, Okayama. She was commissioned on 28 March 1981, and was deployed at the Ominato District Force (home-ported at Mutsu, Aomori). The Ominato District is the northernmost district of the JMSDF and forefront against the Russian Pacific Fleet. It was decided that "Ishikari" was too small to continue production, so the vessel was succeeded by the two years later.

Ductal carcinoma in situ

Ductal carcinoma "in situ" (DCIS), also known as intraductal carcinoma, is a pre-cancerous or non-invasive cancerous lesion of the breast. DCIS is classified as Stage 0. It rarely produces symptoms or a breast lump that can be felt, typically being detected through screening mammography. It has been diagnosed in a significant percentage of men (see male breast cancer).
In DCIS, abnormal cells are found in the lining of one or more milk ducts in the breast. "In situ" means "in place" and refers to the fact that the abnormal cells have not moved out of the mammary duct and into any of the surrounding tissues in the breast ("pre-cancerous" indicates that it has not yet become an invasive cancer). In some cases, DCIS may become invasive and spread to other tissues, but there is no way of determining which lesions will remain stable without treatment, and which will go on to become invasive. DCIS encompasses a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from low-grade lesions that are not life-threatening to high-grade (i.e., potentially highly aggressive) lesions.
DCIS has been classified according to the architectural pattern of the cells (solid, cribriform, papillary, and micropapillary), tumor grade (high, intermediate, and low grade), or the presence or absence of comedo histology; or, in the case of the apocrine cell-based in situ carcinoma, apocrine ductal carcinoma "in situ", it may be classified according to the cell type forming the lesion. DCIS can be detected on mammograms by examining tiny specks of calcium known as microcalcifications. Since suspicious groups of microcalcifications can appear even in the absence of DCIS, a biopsy may be necessary for diagnosis.
About 20–30% of those who do not receive treatment develop breast cancer. DCIS is the most common type of pre-cancer in women. There is some disagreement on its status as cancer; some bodies include DCIS when calculating breast cancer statistics, while others do not.
Terminology.
Ductal carcinoma "in situ" (DCIS) literally means groups of "cancerous" epithelial cells which remain in their normal location ("in situ") within the ducts and lobules of the mammary gland. Clinically, DCIS is considered to be a premalignant (i.e. potentially malignant) condition, because the biologically abnormal cells have not yet crossed the basement membrane to invade the surrounding tissue. When multiple lesions (known as "foci" of DCIS) are present in different quadrants of the breast, this is referred to as "multicentric" disease.
For statistical purposes, DCIS is sometimes counted as a "cancer", but this is not always the case. When classified as a cancer, it is referred to as a "non-invasive" or "pre-invasive" form. It is described by the National Cancer Institute as a "noninvasive condition".
Signs and symptoms.
Most of the women who develop DCIS do not experience any symptoms. The majority of cases (80-85%) are detected through screening mammography. The first signs and symptoms may appear if the cancer advances. Because of the lack of early symptoms, DCIS is most often detected at screening mammography.
In a few cases, DCIS may cause:
Causes.
The specific causes of DCIS are still unknown. The risk factors for developing this condition are similar to those for invasive breast cancer.
Some women are however more prone than others to developing DCIS. Women considered at higher risks are those who have a family history of breast cancer, those who have had their periods at an early age or who have had a late menopause. Also, women who have never had children or had them late in life are also more likely to get this condition.
Long-term use of estrogen-progestin hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for more than five years after menopause, genetic mutations (BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes), atypical hyperplasia, as well as radiation exposure or exposure to certain chemicals may also contribute in the development of the condition. Nonetheless, the risk of developing noninvasive cancer increases with age and it is higher in women older than 45 years.
Diagnosis.
80% of cases in the United States are detected by mammography screening. More definitive diagnosis is made by breast biopsy for histopathology.
Treatment.
There are different opinions on the best treatment of DCIS. Surgical removal, with or without additional radiation therapy or tamoxifen, is the recommended treatment for DCIS by the National Cancer Institute. Surgery may be either a breast-conserving lumpectomy or a mastectomy (complete or partial removal of the affected breast). If a lumpectomy is used it is often combined with radiation therapy. Tamoxifen may be used as hormonal therapy if the cells show estrogen receptor positivity. Research shows that survival is the same with lumpectomy as it is with mastectomy, whether or not a woman has radiation after lumpectomy. Chemotherapy is not needed for DCIS since the disease is noninvasive.
While surgery reduces the risk of subsequent cancer, many people never develop cancer even without treatment and the associated side effects. There is no evidence comparing surgery with watchful waiting and some feel watchful waiting may be a reasonable option in certain cases.
Radiation therapy.
Use of radiation therapy after lumpectomy provides equivalent survival rates to mastectomy, although there is a slightly higher risk of recurrent disease in the same breast in the form of further DCIS or invasive breast cancer. Systematic reviews (including a Cochrane review) indicate that the addition of radiation therapy to lumpectomy reduces recurrence of DCIS or later onset of invasive breast cancer in comparison with breast-conserving surgery alone, without affecting mortality. The Cochrane review did not find any evidence that the radiation therapy had any long-term toxic effects. While the authors caution that longer follow-up will be required before a definitive conclusion can be reached regarding long-term toxicity, they point out that ongoing technical improvements should further restrict radiation exposure in healthy tissues. They do recommend that comprehensive information on potential side effects is given to women who receive this treatment. The addition of radiation therapy to lumpectomy appears to reduce the risk of local recurrence to approximately 12%, of which approximately half will be DCIS and half will be invasive breast cancer; the risk of recurrence is 1% for women undergoing mastectomy.
Mastectomy.
There is no evidence that mastectomy decreases the risk of death over a lumpectomy. Mastectomy, however, may decrease the rate of the DCIS or invasive cancer occurring in the same location.
Mastectomies remain a common recommendation in those with persistent microscopic involvement of margins after local excision or with a diagnosis of DCIS and evidence of suspicious, diffuse microcalcifications.
Sentinel node biopsy.
Some institutions that have encountered high rates of recurrent invasive cancers after mastectomy for DCIS have endorsed routine sentinel node biopsy (SNB). However, research indicates that sentinel node biopsy has risks that outweigh the benefits for most women with DCIS. SNB should be considered with tissue diagnosis of high-risk DCIS (grade III with palpable mass or larger size on imaging) as well as in people undergoing mastectomy after a core or excisional biopsy diagnosis of DCIS.
Prognosis.
With treatment, the prognosis is excellent, with greater than 97% long-term survival. If untreated, DCIS progresses to invasive cancer in roughly one-third of cases, usually in the same breast and quadrant as the earlier DCIS. About 2% of women who are diagnosed with this condition and treated died within 10 years. Biomarkers can identify which women who were initially diagnosed with DCIS are at high or low risk of subsequent invasive cancer.
Epidemiology.
DCIS is often detected with mammographies but can rarely be felt. With the increasing use of screening mammography, noninvasive cancers are more frequently diagnosed and now constitute 15% to 20% of all breast cancers.
Cases of DCIS have increased five-fold between 1983 and 2003 in the United States due to the introduction of screening mammography. In 2009 about 62,000 cases were diagnosed.
