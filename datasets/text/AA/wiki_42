Louis Desaix

Louis Charles Antoine Desaix () (17 August 176814 June 1800) was a French general and military leader during the French Revolutionary Wars. According to the usage of the time, he took the name "Louis Charles Antoine Desaix de Veygoux". He was considered one of the greatest generals of the Revolutionary Wars.
Biography.
Desaix was born to a noble family in the Château d'Ayat in Ayat-sur-Sioule, in the province of Auvergne, to Gilbert des Aix, Lord of Veygoux, the family manor in Charbonnières-les-Varennes, and Amable de Beaufranchet, his wife and first cousin. Desaix received his military education at the school founded by Marshal d'Effiat, and entered the French royal army. During his first six years of service, he devoted himself to duty and to military studies. When the French Revolution broke out, he threw himself into the insurrectionist cause. Refusing to "emigrate", he joined the staff of Charles Louis Victor de Broglie, the Jacobin son of the duc de Broglie. This nearly cost Desaix his life, but he escaped the guillotine, and by his conspicuous service soon came into favor with the Republican government. Like many other members of the old ruling classes who had accepted the new order, the instinct of command joined to native ability, brought Desaix career success, and thus he had attained the command of a division in 1794.
During the campaign of 1795 he commanded Jourdan's right-wing, and during Moreau's invasion of Bavaria, the following year, he held an equally important command. Following the retreat which ensued when the archduke Charles won the battles of Amberg and Würzburg, Desaix commanded Moreau's rearguard, and later the fortress of Kehl, with the highest distinction, and his name became a household word, like those of Bonaparte, Jourdan, Hoche, Marceau and Kléber. Next year his initial successes were interrupted by the Preliminaries of Leoben, and he procured for himself a mission into Italy in order to meet General Bonaparte, who spared no pains to captivate the brilliant young general from the almost rival camps of Germany. Provisionally appointed commander of the Army of England, Desaix was soon transferred by Bonaparte to the expeditionary force intended to invade Egypt. It was his division which bore the brunt of the Mamluk attack at the Battle of the Pyramids, and he crowned his reputation by his victories over Murad Bey in Upper Egypt. Amongst the fellaheen he acquired the significant appellation of the "Just Sultan".
When command passed to Kléber, Desaix was one of a small party of French officers selected to accompany Bonaparte back to France. However, it was months before he could join the new First Consul. After being recalled from Upper Egypt, Desaix embarked on a ship which set sail for Europe on 3 March 1800. However, after the ship arrived in Livorno, British Admiral Lord Keith, in defiance of the Convention of El Arish, declared Desaix to be a prisoner of war and detained him, refusing to recognise his status as a general officer. Desaix allegedly responded to Keith's decision by stating "I ask you nothing except to deliver me from your presence. If you wish, give straw to the wounded who are with me. I dealt with the Mamelukes, the Turks, the Arabs of the great Desert, the Ethiopians, the blacks of Darfur; all respected their word when they gave it, and they did not insult men in misfortune." Desaix was eventually let go as a result of superior orders from the British Admiralty.
The campaign of 1800 was close to its climax when Desaix arrived in Italy. He was immediately assigned to the command of a corps of two infantry divisions serving in the Army of Italy. Three days later (14 June), detached, with Boudet's division, at Rivalta, he heard the cannon of Marengo on his right. Taking the initiative he marched at once towards the sound, meeting Bonaparte's staff officer, who had come to recall him, halfway on the route. He arrived with Boudet's division at the moment when the Austrians were victorious all along the line. Exclaiming, "There is yet time to win another battle!" he led his three regiments straight against the enemy's center. At the moment of victory, Desaix was killed by a musket ball. On the same day, Jean-Baptiste Kleber, Desaix's good friend and comrade, and the governor-general of Egypt, was assassinated in Cairo. Upon hearing the news of Desaix's death, a grief-stricken Napoleon Bonaparte exclaimed, "Why am I not allowed to weep?" 
Memory.
Napoleon paid tribute to Desaix by erecting monuments to him, one on the Place Dauphine and the other in the Place des Victoires in Paris. The memorial in the Place des Victoires was later destroyed. A monumental tomb with sculptures by Jean-Guillaume Moitte serves as his final resting place at the Great St Bernard Hospice (his body originally lay in Milan and was moved to the Hospice in 1805). Moreover, his name is written on a face of the Arc de Triomphe, with many other military figures of the French Revolution. There is also a fort, in Fort-de-France, Martinique, that is named Fort Desaix in his honor. A street, Rue Desaix, and a parallel cul-de-sac, Square Desaix, in the fifteenth arrondissement of Paris, between two metro stations, Bir-Hakeim and Dupleix, also bear his name. Desaix Boulevard is a major street in the Bayou St. John / Fairgrounds district of New Orleans. Several ships of the French Navy have borne the name "Desaix" in his honor.

İbrahim Peçevi

İbrahim Peçevi or Peçuyli İbrahim Efendi or "(in Bosnian)" Ibrahim Alajbegović Pečevija (1572–1650) (Ottoman Turkish: پچویلی ابراهیم افندى ) was an Ottoman Bosnian historian-chronicler of the Ottoman Empire.
Life.
He was born in Pécs (Peçuy), Ottoman Empire (today Hungary), hence his name, Peçevi ("from Pécs"). His mother was from the Sokolović Bosnian family. The name of his father is unknown. His paternal great-grandfather was a Turkish sipahi named Kara Davut Agha who was in the service of Mehmed II.
Peçevi was a provincial official in many places and became a historian after his retirement in 1641. He spoke Ottoman Turkish and his native Bosnian very well. The year of his death is not known. According to Katip Çelebi, he died in the Islamic year of 1061 (1650 AD). Some historians think he died before 1649.
Works.
Peçevi Effendi is famous for his two-volume book "Tarih-i Peçevi" ("Pecevi's History") of the history of the Ottoman Empire, the main reference for the period 1520–1640. The information about earlier events Peçevi took from previous works and narrations of veterans, while his own times are described firsthand and from tales of witnesses. Peçevi, careful to references all quotations, was also one of the first Ottoman historians who used European written sources; for example, he makes references to Hungarian historians. Parts of Peçevi's chronicles has been translated into Turkish, Bosnian, German, Hungarian, Georgian and Azerbaijani.

Torosay Castle

Torosay Castle is a large house situated south of Craignure, in the parish of Torosay, on the Isle of Mull, in the Scottish Inner Hebrides.
Castle History.
The buildings and gardens were listed by Historic Scotland in 1987. The agency indicates that the property was originally known as Duart House. One source explains that it was renamed Torosay to avoid confusing it with Duart Castle which is also located on the island, on the Sound of Mull.
It was designed by architect David Bryce for John Campbell of Possil (see Carter-Campbell of Possil) in the Scottish Baronial style. A history by Undiscovered Scotland provides these specifics:
"In the 1850s Colonel Campbell's son John inherited the estate, demolished the Georgian house, and commissioned Edinburgh architect David Bryce to produce something on a much grander scale. What was called at the time Duart House was completed in 1858".
In 1865, the property was sold to Arbuthnot Charles Guthrie and was owned by members of that family until 1911, when it was sold as a ruin to Sir Fitzroy Maclean who arranged to restore the castle. Following the sale of Guthrie Castle out of the Guthrie family, Torosay was generally acknowledged as the seat for Clan Guthrie.
Torosay is surrounded by of spectacular gardens including formal terraces laid out at the turn of the 20th century and attributed to Sir Robert Lorimer. The castle and gardens used to be open to the public, being linked to the Craignure ferry terminal by the Isle of Mull Railway.
The garden's Statue Walk is made up of 19 statues in the style of Italian sculptor Antonio Bonazza. The statues were acquired by then-owner Walter Murray Guthrie from a derelict garden near Milan and shipped to Scotland for next to nothing as ballast in a cargo ship.
The novelist Angela du Maurier, older sister of Dame Daphne du Maurier, is said to have spent some time residing at Torosay with her close companion Olive Guthrie (great grandmother of the present owner). Angela dedicated her book "Weep No More" (1940) to "Olive Guthrie of Torosay." Other visitors during the 1930s included Winston Churchill (Olive Guthrie was his aunt by marriage) and King George of Greece.
21st century.
The castle was sold in 2012 by Christopher Guthrie-James, the fifth laird of Torosay Castle. The new owner, the McLean Fund, closed it for renovations; it was occupied again in December 2013 by a private family. Guthrie-James said, "it was with a sense of relief, rather than regret, that we sold the family home at Torosay." Kenneth Donald McLean, sixth laird, has spent more than £1 million renovating the castle and gardens. The castle is permanently closed to the public. The gardens are open on the first Sunday in the month from April to October.
A report published in March 2017 referred to the new owner as "Madame von Speyr, whose charity, the Dew Cross Centre for Moral Technology, is said to be based here". The charity, however, listed its base as Edinburgh in 2019.
Champagne find.
In July 2008, the then oldest bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne was discovered inside a sideboard in Torosay Castle. The 1893 bottle was in mint condition. It is believed to have been locked inside the dark sideboard since at least 1897. The champagne is now on display at the Veuve Clicquot visitor centre in Reims, France, and regarded as "priceless".

Tom Campbell (radio personality)

Tom Campbell (nicknamed Tall Tom Campbell, fl. late 20th century) is an American radio personality and commercial voiceover talent.
After serving in the United States Air Force, Campbell was hired for his first radio job, at KEEL in Shreveport, La., by Al Hart, who would later become a newscaster and radio personality in San Francisco.
Campbell subsequently worked in Minneapolis, Minnesota and at WONE in Dayton, Ohio before his move to KYA 1260 AM San Francisco in 1967. He was known to loan his personal phonograph, record collection and even his car to individual listeners under the caveat that they simply return them, which they apparently did. His home and car phone numbers were publicly listed in the white and yellow pages of most Bay Area phone books, and he would receive calls from listeners at home.
Some of his devoted listeners and regular callers included "The Queen of Darkness" and "The Queen of Lightness" of Oakland, "The Mad Bomber" of Berkeley, and "The Wizard" of San Francisco.
On September 9, 1968, Campbell pulled a notable publicity stunt on KYA, claiming that a listener to another program, the Sunday-night phone-in program known as "The Action Line", had disparaged Campbell's accessibility to his fans. Campbell opened his program that evening with a phone call, during which he booked a one-way ticket to New York. Later in the program, he noted that he had been offered jobs in both New York and Chicago, and that if his listeners felt the same way about him, he would simply leave San Francisco and take a job elsewhere.
Phone calls, telegrams and petitions reportedly flooded into the station, and Campbell kept himself off the air until all of the "votes" for or against him were counted. In the end, it was announced that sufficient pro-Campbell votes had been received, and he triumphantly returned to the broadcast booth the next night.
Campbell remained at KYA until 1970, then moved to KLOK in San Jose and KNEW in Oakland. Among his best-known advertising clients were Matthew’s TV &amp; Stereo ("6400 Mission Street, Top of the hill, Daly City"), Motor Music, Goodies Speed Shops and The Comfort Zone waterbed stores. He would also make public appearances to promote local Pizza Hut restaurants before relocating to Southern California in the mid-1970s, becoming a ubiquitous commercial voiceover artist.
In March 1974, the San Mateo and San Francisco County District Attorneys charged Tom Campbell and local stereo store owner Steven Matthew David (Matthew’s, "Top of The Hill" Daly City) for using what the San Francisco Examiner called “bait and switch” tactics. David and Campbell advertised impossibly low prices on products that were conveniently out of stock as a way of luring customers into the store. David paid an out-of-court settlement of $80,000.
Campbell also did weekly broadcasts through the Armed Forces Radio Network and visited troops stationed overseas and emceed concerts at Bay Area venues such as the Circle Star Theater in San Carlos, California (Tom Jones/Engelbert Humperdinck), Sandcastle nightclub in Los Altos (Zola Taylor and the Platters, The Coasters and Clyde McPhatter), and several oldies rock and roll concerts with scores of headliners.
Campbell also briefly hosted a short-lived game show in 1980, "Camouflage", which was produced by Chuck Barris and taped in Hollywood. Although Campbell never hosted another game show, he was later considered for the emcee position on "Sale of the Century" and presided over an unsold 1985 pilot for a revival of "Gambit".

Hendrik Bulthuis

Hendrik Jan Bulthuis (15 September 1865, in Warffum – 27 April 1945, in Noordbroek) was a Dutch customs official, author, and translator of more than thirty works into Esperanto. One of his novels, "Idoj de Orfeo" ("Children of Orpheus") is listed in William Auld's .
Life and career.
Born in the province of Groningen in northeast Netherlands, Bulthuis was a customs officer by profession from 1889 until 1924. In his youth he was a Volapükist. In 1899 he received a diploma in Volapük as a master teacher (). His third son, Rico Bulthuis (The Hague 1911 - 2009) became a respected author who said of his father: "He spoke nine languages, but in none of these languages ever had a conversation with me".
Esperanto activity.
In 1901 D. Uitterdijk sent him a textbook of Esperanto, after which he became an Esperantist. He engaged in much correspondence with Esperantists of other countries, did much Esperanto publicity, especially in The Hague, taught courses, and served as the secretary of the examinations committee from its establishment until the present. From 1910 on L. K. In latter years he worked only for Esperanto; as a novelist (of works originally in Esperanto), a translator and author of small booklets, Bulthuis has been one of the most enduring workers in Esperanto.
Literary activity.
Starting in 1907, when his translation from French of "Two Tickets" ("Du Biletoj") by Florian appeared, he published 35 books and brochures. 
"Never is Better than Late", a comedy translated from English, seemingly his first printed work, appeared in the lit. appendix of "L. I." (International Language) in 1905. He became known mainly for a trio of original works. "The Children of Orpheus", 1923, despite some implausibilities, marked its author as a clear stylist and a person of outstanding storytelling talent. It still remains perhaps the most popular of his magnum opi. That was followed by the naively simple "Joseph and Potifer's Wife", 1926, and "The Fuzzy Hand", 1928, an intimately aware picture of Dutch peasant life, in which Bulthuis's inclination for non-veresimilitude is still evident.
Next in importance are his grandiose translations: Hendrik Conscience's classic "The Lion of Flanders" (1929) from the Dutch; the thematically heavy but well translated "Emperor and Galilean", 1930, from the Norwegian of Ibsen. Both of these works were crowned by the Academy. "Jane Eyre", 1930, from the English of Ch. Bronte survived a careless translation well enough to remain an interesting story, thanks to its essential value. There also appeared in 1926 "Little Johannes" ("La Malgranda Johano") from the Dutch of van Eeden. As a poet Bulthuis published only "The Two Ships" ("La Du Sxipoj"), 1909, for which he received a prize from Barcelona. For the Theatre in 1908 he wrote the praised (?) "Uncle from America" ("Onklo el Ameriko"), 1922; a drama "Poor in Spirit" ("Malricxa en Spirito") and, from the German, translated "Salome", 1910, a drama by the Englishman, Wilde.
Worth mentioning from his other works are: the translations "Diary of a Village Clerk", 1921, and "Josepha", 1922, both from the Danish by Blicher; and in 1921 "Character", from the Dutch by Luiscius (that work has also appeared in Finnish, Czech, Italian, Catalan, all translated from the Esperanto text.) His nine school readers, mostly for little Dutch children, and his retelling for youth of Robinson Crusoe, were conscientiously done.
Later Bulthuis is translated Don Quixote from Spanish and wrote another youth novel. The most extensive commentary on Bulthuis's works is by Nekrasov, who wrote extensive critiques of both his original novels from a Marxist viewpoint for the ante-schism ""La Nova epoko" (The New Epoch) (Oct. 1929-Feb. 1930) and for the post-schism "La Nova Etapo"" (The New Stage) (1932). That was too tendentiously Marxist to encounter general agreement. Bulthuis's language style is simple, classical, without ornamentation. One can hardly find in it attempts at "impressionistic" experiment. He is more correctly called a weaver of stories, than a conscious "evolver" of our language. R. Banham.

Joseph G. Gall

Joseph Grafton Gall (April 14, 1928 – September 12, 2024) was an American cell biologist whose studies revealed many details of chromosome structure and function. Gall's studies were greatly facilitated by his knowledge of many different organisms because he could select the most favorable organism to study when approaching a specific question about nuclear structure. He was awarded the 2006 Albert Lasker Special Achievement Award. He was also a co-recipient (with Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol W. Greider) of the 2007 Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University. In 1983 he was honored with the highest recognition of the American Society for Cell Biology, the E. B. Wilson Medal. He had been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968, the National Academy of Sciences in 1972, and the American Philosophical Society in 1989.
Research career.
Gall was called "the father of cell biology" in his citation for the Lasker award. Gall was a major contributor to the theory that a chromosome contained one DNA molecule running from one end to the other. In chromosomes after DNA replication, each of the two daughter chromatids had one DNA molecule running its length. He revealed this structure by examining amphibian lampbrush chromosomes in the microscope after staining for DNA and for RNA and also after treatment with enzymes that break down DNA or RNA. Although the Feulgen stain for DNA was not sensitive enough to stain the DNA in the loops of these chromosomes, but only stained the long axis of the structure, the loops were sensitive to DNase so they must contain DNA that maintained their loop structure. Later, staining with DAPI, a more sensitive dye, revealed the DNA running through each loop and then returning to the axis of the chromosome. He also unveiled the structure and location of the rDNA, the part of the genome that specifies the ribosomal RNA and made many more important discoveries about nuclear structure.
Gall and then-graduate student Mary-Lou Pardue wanted to find out where in the chromosomes a distinctive highly repeated DNA sequence called satellite DNA occurred. To show the location of this special DNA, they developed the widely used laboratory technique known as "in situ hybridization". Using this method, they found that satellite DNA occurred at the ends or telomeres of the chromosomes.
When Elizabeth Blackburn, 2009 Nobel laureate in Medicine, worked with Gall they analyzed the ends of chromosomes and identified the major short repeated sequence that occurs in telomeres of most higher organisms. Blackburn and her student Carol Greider later discovered the enzyme telomerase that maintains the lengths of the protective telomeric sequences and identified its role in aging.
Role as a mentor of women scientists.
Gall is credited with encouraging women biologists, a group sometimes called "Gall's Gals", in an era when this was relatively uncommon. A number of his former students have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences and won major research prizes including the Nobel Prize. His students have included Joan Argetsinger Steitz, Mary-Lou Pardue, and Elizabeth Blackburn.
One of his students who went on to do important work in cytology is Susan Gerbi. She co—wrote an article about Gall's life and work in 2003. In her conversations with Gall, when asked to explain his encouragement of women in the sciences, he spoke about his mother. Gifted in math and science, she had been the first woman in her family to attend college, graduating in the 1920s. She became a homemaker, not a scientist. But she urged a young Joseph Gall to explore the natural world, encouraging him to catch bugs and bring them into the house so together they could identify the creatures using scientific reference books. "It never occurred to me that a woman's aptitude was different than a man's," Gall said. "My father -- a lawyer -- was afraid of animals and insects. So, if anything, maybe I thought it went the other way.".
Death and legacy.
In 2005, Gall was featured in a series of interviews with well-known television personality, Bill Nye, for the Science Channel's "100 Greatest Discoveries" series.
Gall died at his home in Baltimore on September 12, 2024, at the age of 96.

Pirate Ship Higemaru

 is a 1984 maze video game developed and published by Capcom for arcades. The gameplay is similar to that of Sega's 1982 game "Pengo", but with the arctic theme replaced with that of a pirate ship.
The game was later included in the 1998 compilation "Capcom Generations: The First Generation" for the PlayStation (in Japan and Europe) and Sega Saturn (Japan only). Like the other games in the "Capcom Generations" titles, it was included in the 2005 compilation "Capcom Classics Collection" for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and in the PlayStation Portable version "Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded", which was the first time the game was released for home consoles in North America.
Gameplay.
The player controls a sailor, by the name of Momotaru, who must use barrels to defeat the titular pirate crew. Momotaru has no attacks of his own, but he has the ability to grab barrels, drums, large bags, and various other items which he can throw (either horizontally or vertically) across the screen. Any pirate who stands in the way of a barrel or other object will be hurled off the screen. Barrels that impact the walls of a stage or other barrels or objects will shatter and produce points, while other objects are invulnerable (but do not produce points). Each successive enemy that is hit by a barrel will yield additional points once the barrel is destroyed. In addition, there are also various items hidden beneath barrels in each level which will give Momotaru bonus points. Every floor of the ship has a set number of pirates to be destroyed, as well as a single "Bows", a special pirate that regenerates each time it is defeated. Every fourth level in the game yields a bonus level in which the barrels are worth an increased number of points, and a group of enemies entirely made up of Bows (which do not regenerate in this case). 
With each successive floor, the speed and intelligence of the pirates increases. For every sixteen barrels Momotaru destroys, he will be rewarded with an item that grants invincibility for a limited amount of time, allowing him to defeat enemies by simply touching them. Momotaru's enemies do not have attacks, but a single touch from an enemy will cause him to die and be revived, costing the player one extra life; the game ends when the player runs out of lives. When a player has scored more than 1 million points, the game will stop awarding the player with bonus lives. The game has no ending and loops indefinitely after level sixteen. The enemy patterns and color will reset to level one but the game will not reset the deck counter. The layout of the barrels on the stages will continue to change, however, and the enemy count per level will not reset to level one counts.

Farmers' Almanac TV

Farmers' Almanac TV is a television show that was originally broadcast throughout the USA on public television, based on the periodical of the same name. The magazine-style show covers interesting personalities, unique events and admirable endeavors from both the familiar and remote corners of the North American landscape. Peppered throughout are hints and tips that span a dozen varied lifestyle categories—gardening, cooking, natural cures, weather and others—taken straight from years of actual Almanac pages. The show is hosted by Jim Wann, the Tony-nominated writer of the musical "Pump Boys and Dinettes".
The studio Farmers' Almanac TV filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2009. The filing was in Chatham County, Georgia, with documents revealing that the company made no revenue in any of its years of operation. Over 50 investors have been cut out of any profits as the judge allowed the dissolving company's officers to value the assets at under $150,000, which would go to Turner Investments, an insider who loaned the company money one year earlier.
Background.
The Farmers' Almanac TV studio had the exclusive license to use the "Farmers' Almanac" trademarks and copyrights for video and electronic media production. Founded in 2003 by Savannah, GA-based Buy The Farm, LLC, the studio produced "Farmers' Almanac TV". The flagship series debuted on public television in 2006, and once aired in almost 90% of the nation. The weekly 30-minute magazine-format series covered fascinating personalities, unique events and admirable endeavors from both the familiar and remote corners of the North American landscape. Peppered throughout are hints and tips that span a dozen varied lifestyle categories—gardening, cooking, natural cures, weather and others—taken straight from years of actual "Almanac" pages.
There are plans for Farmers' Almanac TV to relaunch on RFD, according to Ogden Media which sells advertising for "Farmers' Almanac" and its TV offering.

Doug Supernaw

Douglas Anderson Supernaw (September 26, 1960November 13, 2020) was an American country music artist. After several years performing as a local musician throughout the state of Texas, he signed with BNA Records in 1993.
Supernaw released four studio albums in his career: "Red and Rio Grande" (1993), "Deep Thoughts from a Shallow Mind" (1994), "You Still Got Me" (1995), and "Fadin' Renegade" (1999). Between 1993 and 1996, he charted 11 singles on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts, including "I Don't Call Him Daddy", his only No. 1 single, in late 1993.
Biography.
Douglas Anderson Supernaw was born on September 26, 1960, in Bryan, Texas. He grew up in Inwood Forest and was an avid golfer as well as a member of his high school golf team. His mother, a fan of country music, exposed Supernaw to acts such as George Jones and Gene Watson, by whose works he would later be influenced.
Supernaw attended college on a golfing scholarship. After dropping out of college in 1979, he briefly worked on an oil rig before serving as a musician in local bands. Supernaw moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1987, where he found work as a session songwriter. After four years in Nashville, Supernaw moved back to Texas, where he founded a band called Texas Steel.
1993–1995: BNA Records.
An A&amp;R executive for RCA Records discovered Supernaw and signed him to the label's BNA Entertainment (now BNA Records) division in 1993. That year, Supernaw released his debut album, "Red and Rio Grande". From the album, four singles were released, starting with "Honky Tonkin' Fool", which did not enter Top 40 on the "Billboard" country music charts. "Reno", the second single, reached Top 5 soon afterward, while its follow-up, "I Don't Call Him Daddy" (previously a No. 86 single in 1988 for Kenny Rogers), became Supernaw's only Number One single by the end of the year. The album went on to achieve gold certification in the United States.
A series of injuries nearly ended Supernaw's career after his first album's release. After recovering from a broken neck suffered while surfing, he was involved in a head-on car collision. Finally, he was hospitalized after a nearly-fatal case of food poisoning. Once he had recovered from the food poisoning, he recorded his second album for BNA, 1994's "Deep Thoughts from a Shallow Mind". Of the album's three singles, only the Dennis Linde-penned "What'll You Do About Me" (previously a single in 1984 for Steve Earle, and in 1992 for the Forester Sisters, and recorded by Randy Travis on his 1987 album "Always &amp; Forever") entered Top 40 on the country music charts. Shortly after the second album's release, he exited BNA's roster.
Also in 1994, Supernaw was nominated for Top New Male Vocalist and Song of the Year by the Academy of Country Music but lost in both categories to John Michael Montgomery.
1995–1997: Giant / Sony BMG Records.
In 1995, he was signed to Giant Records, where he recorded and released his third major-label album, "You Still Got Me", in 1996. Although its first single, "Not Enough Hours in the Night", reached a peak of No. 3 on the country singles charts, neither of the album's other singles reached Top 40, and he left Giant Records not long afterward. He also made an appearance on "Stars and Stripes Vol. 1", a 1996 compilation album issued by the Beach Boys. It featured the band performing their own songs along with other country music artists; Supernaw contributed to the track "Long Tall Texan". His first compilation album, entitled "The Encore Collection", was issued by Sony BMG Special Products in 1997.
1999: Tack Records.
Supernaw's third recording contract was with the small, independent Tack label, on which he released "Fadin' Renegade" on August 31, 1999. The album's two singles, the title track and "21–17", did not enter the country music charts.
2016–2020: B&amp;G Records.
Supernaw returned to music in 2016 in local venues in his home state of Texas. Also returning to the recording studio in 2017 on the independent B&amp;G Records label, Supernaw re-recorded his hits as "Greatest Hits", which was released on April 1, 2017. The album included two new songs: "Here's My Heart" and "The Company I Keep".
Personal life and death.
Supernaw's son, Phillip, was a tight end in the NFL.
On February 4, 2019, Supernaw announced that he had been diagnosed with stage IV lung and bladder cancer. Supernaw died at his home on November 13, 2020, at age 60.

Land of Lakes Choirboys

The Land of Lakes Choirboys was a nonprofit boys choir organization based in Elk River, Minnesota. Consisting of four individual choir ensembles, the organization performed in local, national, and international locations. Known for singing works of various musicians such as Bach and Antonio Vivaldi, the choristers sang both religious and secular music.
History.
Land of Lakes Choirboys was founded by Craig Carmody-Anderson in 1976. It consisted of a single choir and depended on the community and a school building to support choir events. It started with eighteen members and was conducted by Anderson. The choir bought several acres of land and an old schoolhouse building near Elk River, Minnesota in 1991. This is where the organization functioned, holding its choir rehearsals and activities.
Francis Stockwell was hired as conductor. Stockwell was a music director at a school in Switzerland and had experience working with the Vienna Boys' Choir. The Choir then established a second ensemble that was used to train choristers until they were invited into the touring choir. Anderson directed the training choir while Stockwell directed the touring choir.
In 2002, the State of Minnesota ordered the condemnation of the choir's land to construct a highway overpass. Rehearsals and activities were temporarily held inside a local church building until the choir purchased a facility near St. Francis, Minnesota. Through time, the choir grew large enough for the organization to hire Aaron Carpenter. Carpenter took the direction of two new training choirs and later the national touring choir.
In February 2010, one of their former choirboys took over as executive director. P.J. Fanberg was a choirboy from 1994 to 1997. In the winter of 2011, Stockwell and Anderson left the group. After the departure of Stockwell, associate director Aaron Carpenter was promoted to the position of artistic director. Carpenter then brought on two associate directors, Corinne Anderson and Taylor Quinn. In 2013, the choir sold its property in St. Francis and moved back into the heart of Elk River, MN now sharing a rehearsal and office space with Elk River Lutheran Church on Main Street. Carpenter also was appointed executive director to replace the outgoing Fanberg. In 2018, Quinn left.
In 2020 the choir was greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Elk River Lutheran Church was closed during the early months of the pandemic which forced the choir to rehearse online. In July 2021 Aaron Carpenter accepted a position with the St. John's Boys’ Choir based in Collegeville, Minnesota. Nathan Herfindahl was named as the artistic director for the choir in August 2021. He served in this position for the 46th season of the choir.
In July 2022, the choir board of directors informed the families and staff that the 46th season would be the final season for the choir. The August 2022 Timber Bay camp was canceled and refunds were issued. The choir was formally dissolved over several months.

Quantum cloning

Quantum cloning is a process that takes an arbitrary, unknown quantum state and makes an exact copy without altering the original state in any way. Quantum cloning is forbidden by the laws of quantum mechanics as shown by the no cloning theorem, which states that there is no operation for cloning any arbitrary state formula_1 perfectly. In Dirac notation, the process of quantum cloning is described by:
formula_2
where formula_3 is the actual cloning operation, formula_1 is the state to be cloned, and formula_5 is the initial state of the copy.
Though perfect quantum cloning is not possible, it is possible to perform imperfect cloning, where the copies have a non-unit (i.e. non-perfect) fidelity. The possibility of approximate quantum copying was first addressed by Buzek and Hillery, and theoretical bounds were derived on the fidelity of cloned quantum states.
One of the applications of quantum cloning is to analyse the security of quantum key distribution protocols. Teleportation, nuclear magnetic resonance, quantum amplification, and superior phase conjugation are examples of some methods utilized to realize a quantum cloning machine. Ion trapping techniques have been applied to cloning quantum states of ions.
Types of quantum cloning machines.
It may be possible to clone a quantum state to arbitrary accuracy in the presence of closed timelike curves.
Universal quantum cloning.
Universal quantum cloning (UQC) implies that the quality of the output (cloned state) is not dependent on the input, thus the process is "universal" to any input state. The output state produced is governed by the Hamiltonian of the system.
One of the first cloning machines, a 1 to 2 UQC machine, was proposed in 1996 by Buzek and Hillery. As the name implies, the machine produces two identical copies of a single input qubit with a fidelity of 5/6 when comparing only one output qubit, and global fidelity of 2/3 when comparing both qubits. This idea was expanded to more general cases such as an arbitrary number of inputs and copies, as well as d-dimensional systems.
Multiple experiments have been conducted to realize this type of cloning machine physically by using photon stimulated emission. The concept relies on the property of certain three-level atoms to emit photons of any polarization with equally likely probability. This symmetry ensures the universality of the machine.
Phase covariant cloning.
When input states are restricted to Bloch vectors corresponding to points on the equator of the Bloch Sphere, more information is known about them. The resulting clones are thus state-dependent, having an optimal fidelity of formula_6. Although only having a fidelity slightly greater than the UQCM (≈0.83), phase covariant cloning has the added benefit of being easily implemented through quantum logic gates consisting of the rotational operator formula_7and the controlled-NOT (CNOT). Output states are also separable according to Peres-Horodecki criterion.
The process has been generalized to the 1 → M case and proven optimal. This has also been extended to the qutrit and qudit cases. The first experimental asymmetric quantum cloning machine was realized in 2004 using nuclear magnetic resonance.
Asymmetric quantum cloning.
The first family of asymmetric quantum cloning machines was proposed by Nicolas Cerf in 1998. A cloning operation is said to be asymmetric if its clones have different qualities and are all independent of the input state. This is a more general case of the symmetric cloning operations discussed above which produce identical clones with the same fidelity. Take the case of a simple 1 → 2 asymmetric cloning machine. There is a natural trade-off in the cloning process in that if one clone's fidelity is fixed to a higher value, the other must decrease in quality and vice versa. The optimal trade-off is bounded by the following inequality:
formula_8 where "Fd" and "Fe" are the state-independent fidelities of the two copies. This type of cloning procedure was proven mathematically to be optimal as derived from the Choi-Jamiolkowski channel state duality. However, even with this cloning machine perfect quantum cloning is proved to be unattainable.
The trade-off of optimal accuracy between the resulting copies has been studied in quantum circuits, and with regards to theoretical bounds.
Optimal asymmetric cloning machines are extended to formula_9 in formula_10 dimensions.
Probabilistic quantum cloning.
In 1998, Duan and Guo proposed a different approach to quantum cloning machines that relies on probability. This machine allows for the "perfect copying" of quantum states without violation of the No-Cloning and No-Broadcasting Theorems, but at the cost of not being 100% reproducible. The cloning machine is termed "probabilistic" because it performs measurements in addition to a unitary evolution. These measurements are then sorted through to obtain the perfect copies with a certain quantum efficiency (probability). As only orthogonal states can be cloned perfectly, this technique can be used to identify non-orthogonal states. The process is optimal when formula_11 where η is the probability of success for the states Ψ0 and Ψ1.
The process was proven mathematically to clone two pure, non-orthogonal input states using a unitary-reduction process. One implementation of this machine was realized through the use of a "noiseless optical amplifier" with a success rate of about 5% .
Applications of approximate quantum cloning.
Cloning in discrete quantum systems.
The simple basis for approximate quantum cloning exists in the first and second trivial cloning strategies. In first trivial cloning, a measurement of a qubit in a certain basis is made at random and yields two copies of the qubit. This method has a universal fidelity of 2/3.
The second trivial cloning strategy, also called "trivial amplification", is a method in which an original qubit is left unaltered, and another qubit is prepared in a different orthogonal state. When measured, both qubits have the same probability, 1/2, (check) and an overall single copy fidelity of 3/4.
Quantum cloning attacks.
Quantum information is useful in the field of cryptography due to its intrinsic encrypted nature. One such mechanism is quantum key distribution. In this process, Bob receives a quantum state sent by Alice, in which some type of classical information is stored. He then performs a random measurement, and using minimal information provided by Alice, can determine whether or not his measurement was "good". This measurement is then transformed into a key in which private data can be stored and sent without fear of the information being stolen.
One reason this method of cryptography is so secure is because it is impossible to eavesdrop due to the no-cloning theorem. A third party, Eve, can use incoherent attacks in an attempt to observe the information being transferred from Bob to Alice. Due to the no-cloning theorem, Eve is unable to gain any information. However, through quantum cloning, this is no longer entirely true.
Incoherent attacks involve a third party gaining some information into the information being transmitted between Bob and Alice. These attacks follow two guidelines: 1) third party Eve must act individually and match the states that are being observed, and 2) Eve's measurement of the traveling states occurs after the sifting phase (removing states that are in non-matched bases) but before reconciliation (putting Alice and Bob's strings back together). Due to the secure nature of quantum key distribution, Eve would be unable to decipher the secret key even with as much information as Bob and Alice. These are known as an incoherent attacks because a random, repeated attack yields the highest chance of Eve finding the key.
Nuclear magnetic resonance.
While classical nuclear magnetic resonance is the phenomenon of nuclei emitting electromagnetic radiation at resonant frequencies when exposed to a strong magnetic field and is used heavily in imaging technology, quantum nuclear magnetic resonance is a type of quantum information processing (QIP). The interactions between the nuclei allow for the application of quantum logic gates, such as the CNOT.
One quantum NMR experiment involved passing three qubits through a circuit, after which they are all entangled; the second and third qubit are transformed into clones of the first with a fidelity of 5/6.
Another application allowed for the alteration of the signal-noise ratio, a process that increased the signal frequency while decreasing the noise frequency, allowing for a clearer information transfer. This is done through polarization transfer, which allows for a portion of the signal's highly polarized electric spin to be transferred to the target nuclear spin.
The NMR system allows for the application of quantum algorithms such as Shor factorization and the Deutsch-Joza algorithm.
Stimulated emission.
Stimulated emission is a type of Universal Quantum Cloning Machine that functions on a three-level system: one ground and two degenerates that are connected by an orthogonal electromagnetic field. The system is able to emit photons by exciting electrons between the levels. The photons are emitted in varying polarizations due to the random nature of the system, but the probability of emission type is equal for all – this is what makes this a universal cloning machine. By integrating quantum logic gates into the stimulated emission system, the system is able to produce cloned states.
Telecloning.
Telecloning is the combination of quantum teleportation and quantum cloning. This process uses positive operator-valued measurements, maximally entangled states, and quantum teleportation to create identical copies, locally and in a remote location. Quantum teleportation alone follows a "one-to-one" or "many-to-many" method in which either one or many states are transported from Alice, to Bob in a remote location. The teleclone works by first creating local quantum clones of a state, then sending these to a remote location by quantum teleportation.
The benefit of this technology is that it removes errors in transmission that usually result from quantum channel decoherence.

Hazard (Rebecca "Becky" Sharpe) is a fictional character appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. She is the granddaughter of Gambler.
Hazard made her live-action debut on the fourth season of "The Flash", portrayed by Sugar Lyn Beard.
Fictional character biography.
During the anti-hero mania that was sweeping the U.S. (during the "Legends" miniseries, 1986), Miss Rebecca Sharpe took the opportunity to avenge the death of her grandfather, Steven Sharpe III alias the Gambler. Rebecca took the name Hazard and joined with the Wizard in his new Injustice Society – which he called Injustice Unlimited. However, she refused to allow anyone to be killed, nor would she cause anyone's death in the process. They overcame the security at the International Trade Conference in Calgary—namely Infinity, Inc. and a contingent of the Global Guardians—and forced the heroes to help in some mayhem. Hazard took Wildcat and the Tasmanian Devil to Las Vegas and, with their help, financially ruined Mr. Taj, proprietor of the Taj Mahal Casino - it had been the crooked games of the casino which were in part to blame for her grandfather's suicide. They all returned to Calgary to share in the stolen wealth which the Wizard had been gathering, but the plan went haywire when Hourman revived and freed himself, as well as when Solomon Grundy was brought in from the Arctic Circle. It was Solomon who incapacitated Hazard, but in the confusion she was able to escape.
Only weeks later, Hazard joined again with the villains the Icicle II and Artemis, along with the Harlequin (Marcie Cooper). The Harlequin brought in the Dummy and a duped Solomon Grundy. Under the leadership of the Dummy, their first goal was to murder the members of Infinity, Inc. so that the world and the criminal underworld would know and fear Injustice Unlimited. Though Hazard had previously voiced an unwillingness to take life, she consented to the murder of the super-powered Infinitors. The first target was Skyman, and he was successfully murdered by Harlequin. Within days Hazard joined with Harlequin and the Dummy to murder Pat Dugan working at Stellar Studios (the Infinity, Inc. HQ) outside Los Angeles. When Pat's young son became a collateral target, however, Hazard used her powers of probability manipulation to help save their lives – the Dummy decided instead to use Dugan as bait for the rest of the Infinitors. When the other heroes arrived at their HQ and the battle was begun, Hazard feigned the loss of her dice and did not join in. Afterwards, when the villains were successfully defeated, Hazard voluntarily entered into custody for her role in the criminal events.
Hazard last appeared with several other villainesses who were hunting male superheroes who had been turned into animals by Circe. This takes place in a magically entrapped New York City.
Powers and abilities.
Hazard has psionic powers that she uses in conjunction with special dice to influence probability as she wishes. She can cause good luck or harmful "accidents" to befall someone. The origin of her powers, nature of her dice, and the relationship between them are unknown. In addition, she keeps herself in good physical condition but has no known training in hand-to-hand combat.
Other versions.
Earth-2.
Roger Sharpe of Earth-2 was introduced in "The New 52" and operates in Casablanca under the alias of "Darcy Twain".

Larkman

Larkman is an Anglo Saxon surname used in the UK, United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Although Larkman is a very uncommon name it is not historically rare in Norfolk, England and it is possible that all Larkmans originated from Norfolk. Research carried out by Frank Randall and Brian Larkman has revealed that only a handful of Larkmans can be found outside Norfolk and Suffolk before 1800.
History of the Name.
Most early Norfolk Larkmans lived off the land as farm labourers, some died as paupers whilst a few prospered and became yeoman farmers who employed others as labourers.
Gradually Larkmans moved from the countryside to the towns, some to Norwich, the more adventurous to London. John Larkman moved to Hull some time after 1824. Many became craftsmen, some Freemen of Norwich and one a Freeman of the City of London. From about 1860 onwards Larkman families moved further a field to the growing industrial centres - Tyneside, Teesside, Birmingham, Manchester and the Midlands.
A Larkman sailed with Shackleton to the Antarctic. William Larkman, a gardener to Norwich gentry gave his name to a part of Norwich which now has a Larkman Lane, Larkman school and a Larkman Pub (now demolished).
A branch of English Larkmans descend from one Johann Lochmann z Gamsenfels, (aka Lachmann von Gamsenfels) who was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia. He came to London around 1880 to escape the Franco-Prussian wars. He settled and married an English girl. His son, Hermann John Lachman von Gamsenfels, changed his name by deed poll, in or around 1900, to John Larkman. Donald Ewart Larkman, who is listed below as having died in World War 2, in the Netherlands, on 17 November 1940, (he was listed as MIA on 16 November, actual death was 17) is descended from this branch of the Larkmans.
Name Meaning.
The Oxford dictionary of surnames gives the definition below.
With just two exceptions (see note below) all Larkman families in the world can trace their ancestry back to the county of Norfolk in eastern England. From the early 15th up to the 18th century, bar two sightings in London, no Larkman is listed outside Norfolk or neighbouring Suffolk. This, along with its rarity, suggests that Larkman is a locative surname i.e. it is derived from a placename.
"British Surnames" by C W Bardsley (published 1901) suggests that Larkman is derived from Lakenham a small village one mile south of Norwich (now a suburb of Norwich). This theory is supported that the earliest recorded Larkmans are to be found in this area and that the surname de Lakenham appears in deeds and apprentice records in the early 14th century. It does not appear in later records.

Models of DNA evolution

A number of different Markov models of DNA sequence evolution have been proposed. These substitution models differ in terms of the parameters used to describe the rates at which one nucleotide replaces another during evolution. These models are frequently used in molecular phylogenetic analyses. In particular, they are used during the calculation of likelihood of a tree (in Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches to tree estimation) and they are used to estimate the evolutionary distance between sequences from the observed differences between the sequences.
Introduction.
These models are phenomenological descriptions of the evolution of DNA as a string of four discrete states. These Markov models do not explicitly depict the mechanism of mutation nor the action of natural selection. Rather they describe the relative rates of different changes. For example, mutational biases and purifying selection favoring conservative changes are probably both responsible for the relatively high rate of transitions compared to transversions in evolving sequences. However, the Kimura (K80) model described below only attempts to capture the effect of both forces in a parameter that reflects the relative rate of transitions to transversions.
Evolutionary analyses of sequences are conducted on a wide variety of time scales. Thus, it is convenient to express these models in terms of the instantaneous rates of change between different states (the "Q" matrices below). If we are given a starting (ancestral) state at one position, the model's "Q" matrix and a branch length expressing the expected number of changes to have occurred since the ancestor, then we can derive the probability of the descendant sequence having each of the four states. The mathematical details of this transformation from rate-matrix to probability matrix are described in the mathematics of substitution models section of the substitution model page. By expressing models in terms of the instantaneous rates of change we can avoid estimating a large numbers of parameters for each branch on a phylogenetic tree (or each comparison if the analysis involves many pairwise sequence comparisons).
The models described on this page describe the evolution of a single site within a set of sequences. They are often used for analyzing the evolution of an entire locus by making the simplifying assumption that different sites evolve independently and are identically distributed. This assumption may be justifiable if the sites can be assumed to be evolving neutrally. If the primary effect of natural selection on the evolution of the sequences is to constrain some sites, then models of among-site rate-heterogeneity can be used. This approach allows one to estimate only one matrix of relative rates of substitution, and another set of parameters describing the variance in the total rate of substitution across sites.
DNA evolution as a continuous-time Markov chain.
Continuous-time Markov chains.
"Continuous-time" Markov chains have the usual transition matrices 
which are, in addition, parameterized by time, formula_1. Specifically, if formula_2 are the states, then the transition matrix
Example: We would like to model the substitution process in DNA sequences ("i.e." Jukes–Cantor, Kimura, "etc.") in a continuous-time fashion. The corresponding transition matrices will look like:
where the top-left and bottom-right 2 × 2 blocks correspond to "transition probabilities" and the top-right and bottom-left 2 × 2 blocks corresponds to "transversion probabilities".
Assumption: If at some time formula_9, the Markov chain is in state formula_5, then the probability that at time formula_11, it will be in state formula_12 depends only upon formula_13, formula_14 and formula_15. This then allows us to write that probability as formula_16.
Theorem: Continuous-time transition matrices satisfy:
Note: There is here a possible confusion between two meanings of the word "transition". (i) In the context of "Markov chains", transition is the general term for the change between two states. (ii) In the context of "nucleotide changes in DNA sequences", transition is a specific term for the exchange between either the two purines (A ↔ G) or the two pyrimidines (C ↔ T) (for additional details, see the article about transitions in genetics). By contrast, an exchange between one purine and one pyrimidine is called a transversion.
Deriving the dynamics of substitution.
Consider a DNA sequence of fixed length "m" evolving in time by base replacement. Assume that the processes followed by the "m" sites are Markovian independent, identically distributed and that the process is constant over time. For a particular site, let
be the set of possible states for the site, and
their respective probabilities at time formula_20. For two distinct formula_21, let formula_22 be the transition rate from state formula_23 to state formula_24. Similarly, for any formula_23, let the total rate of change from formula_23 be
The changes in the probability distribution formula_28 for small increments of time formula_29 are given by
In other words, (in frequentist language), the frequency of formula_31's at time formula_32 is equal to the frequency at time formula_20 minus the frequency of the "lost" formula_31's plus the frequency of the "newly created" formula_31's.
Similarly for the probabilities formula_36, formula_37 and formula_38. These equations can be written compactly as
where
is known as the "rate matrix". Note that, by definition, the sum of the entries in each row of formula_41 is equal to zero. It follows that
For a stationary process, where formula_41 does not depend on time "t", this differential equation can be solved. First,
where formula_45 denotes the exponential of the matrix formula_46. As a result,
Ergodicity.
If the Markov chain is irreducible, "i.e." if it is always possible to go from a state formula_23 to a state formula_24 (possibly in several steps), then it is also ergodic. As a result, it has a unique "stationary distribution" formula_50, where formula_51 corresponds to the proportion of time spent in state formula_23 after the Markov chain has run for an infinite amount of time. In DNA evolution, under the assumption of a common process for each site, the stationary frequencies formula_53 correspond to equilibrium base compositions. Indeed, note that since the stationary distribution formula_54 satisfies formula_55, we see that when the current distribution formula_56 is the stationary distribution formula_54 we have
In other words, the frequencies of formula_59 do not change.
Time reversibility.
Definition: A stationary Markov process is "time reversible" if (in the steady state) the amount of change from state formula_60 to formula_61 is equal to the amount of change from formula_61 to formula_60, (although the two states may occur with different frequencies). This means that:
Not all stationary processes are reversible, however, most commonly used DNA evolution models assume time reversibility, which is considered to be a reasonable assumption.
Under the time reversibility assumption, let formula_65, then it is easy to see that:
Definition The symmetric term formula_67 is called the "exchangeability" between states formula_68 and formula_61. In other words, formula_67 is the fraction of the frequency of state formula_60 that is the result of transitions from state formula_61 to state formula_60.
Corollary The 12 off-diagonal entries of the rate matrix, formula_74 (note the off-diagonal entries determine the diagonal entries, since the rows of formula_74 sum to zero) can be completely determined by 9 numbers; these are: 6 exchangeability terms and 3 stationary frequencies formula_76, (since the stationary frequencies sum to 1).
Scaling of branch lengths.
By comparing extant sequences, one can determine the amount of sequence divergence. This raw measurement of divergence provides information about the number of changes that have occurred along the path separating the sequences. The simple count of differences (the Hamming distance) between sequences will often underestimate the number of substitution because of multiple hits (see homoplasy). Trying to estimate the exact number of changes that have occurred is difficult, and usually not necessary. Instead, branch lengths (and path lengths) in phylogenetic analyses are usually expressed in the expected number of changes per site. The path length is the product of the duration of the path in time and the mean rate of substitutions. While their product can be estimated, the rate and time are not identifiable from sequence divergence.
The descriptions of rate matrices on this page accurately reflect the relative magnitude of different substitutions, but these rate matrices are not scaled such that a branch length of 1 yields one expected change. This scaling can be accomplished by multiplying every element of the matrix by the same factor, or simply by scaling the branch lengths. If we use the β to denote the scaling factor, and ν to denote the branch length measured in the expected number of substitutions per site then βν is used in the transition probability formulae below in place of μ"t". Note that ν is a parameter to be estimated from data, and is referred to as the branch length, while β is simply a number that can be calculated from the rate matrix (it is not a separate free parameter).
The value of β can be found by forcing the expected rate of flux of states to 1. The diagonal entries of the rate-matrix (the "Q" matrix) represent -1 times the rate of leaving each state. For time-reversible models, we know the equilibrium state frequencies (these are simply the π"i" parameter value for state "i"). Thus we can find the expected rate of change by calculating the sum of flux out of each state weighted by the proportion of sites that are expected to be in that class. Setting β to be the reciprocal of this sum will guarantee that scaled process has an expected flux of 1:
For example, in the Jukes–Cantor, the scaling factor would be "4/(3μ)" because the rate of leaving each state is "3μ/4".
Most common models of DNA evolution.
JC69 model (Jukes and Cantor 1969).
JC69, the Jukes and Cantor 1969 model, is the simplest substitution model. There are several assumptions. It assumes equal base frequencies formula_78 and equal mutation rates. The only parameter of this model is therefore formula_79, the overall substitution rate. As previously mentioned, this variable becomes a constant when we normalize the mean-rate to 1.
When branch length, formula_82, is measured in the expected number of changes per site then:
It is worth noticing that formula_84 what stands for sum of any column (or row) of matrix formula_41 multiplied by time and thus means expected number of substitutions in time formula_20 (branch duration) for each particular site (per site) when the rate of substitution equals formula_79.
Given the proportion formula_88 of sites that differ between the two sequences the Jukes–Cantor estimate of the evolutionary distance (in terms of the expected number of changes) between two sequences is given by 
The formula_88 in this formula is frequently referred to as the formula_88-distance. It is a sufficient statistic for calculating the Jukes–Cantor distance correction, but is not sufficient for the calculation of the evolutionary distance under the more complex models that follow (also note that formula_88 used in subsequent formulae is not identical to the "formula_88-distance").
K80 model (Kimura 1980).
K80, the Kimura 1980 model, often referred to as Kimura's two parameter model (or the K2P model), distinguishes between transitions (formula_94, i.e. from purine to purine, or formula_95, i.e. from pyrimidine to pyrimidine) and transversions (from purine to pyrimidine or vice versa). In Kimura's original description of the model the α and β were used to denote the rates of these types of substitutions, but it is now more common to set the rate of transversions to 1 and use κ to denote the transition/transversion rate ratio (as is done below). The K80 model assumes that all of the bases are equally frequent (formula_96).
Rate matrix formula_97 with columns corresponding to formula_98, formula_99, formula_100, and formula_101, respectively.
The Kimura two-parameter distance is given by:
where "p" is the proportion of sites that show transitional differences and 
"q" is the proportion of sites that show transversional differences.
K81 model (Kimura 1981).
K81, the Kimura 1981 model, often called Kimura's three parameter model (K3P model) or the Kimura three substitution type (K3ST) model, has distinct rates for transitions and two distinct types of transversions. The two transversion types are those that conserve the weak/strong properties of the nucleotides (i.e., formula_103 and formula_104, denoted by symbol formula_105 ) and those that conserve the amino/keto properties of the nucleotides (i.e., formula_106 and formula_107, denoted by symbol formula_108 ). The K81 model assumes that all equilibrium base frequencies are equal (i.e., formula_109).
Rate matrix formula_110 with columns corresponding to formula_98, formula_99, formula_100, and formula_101, respectively.
The K81 model is used much less often than the K80 (K2P) model for distance estimation and it is seldom the best-fitting model in maximum likelihood phylogenetics. Despite these facts, the K81 model has continued to be studied in the context of mathematical phylogenetics. One important property is the ability to perform a Hadamard transform assuming the site patterns were generated on a tree with nucleotides evolving under the K81 model. 
When used in the context of phylogenetics the Hadamard transform provides an elegant and fully invertible means to calculate expected site pattern frequencies given a set of branch lengths (or vice versa). Unlike many maximum likelihood calculations, the relative values for formula_115, formula_108, and formula_105 can vary across branches and the Hadamard transform can even provide evidence that the data do not fit a tree. The Hadamard transform can also be combined with a wide variety of methods to accommodate among-sites rate heterogeneity, using continuous distributions rather than the discrete approximations typically used in maximum likelihood phylogenetics (although one must sacrifice the invertibility of the Hadamard transform to use certain among-sites rate heterogeneity distributions).
F81 model (Felsenstein 1981).
F81, the Felsenstein's 1981 model, is an extension of the JC69 model in which base frequencies are allowed to vary from 0.25 (formula_118)
Rate matrix:
When branch length, ν, is measured in the expected number of changes per site then:
HKY85 model (Hasegawa, Kishino and Yano 1985).
HKY85, the Hasegawa, Kishino and Yano 1985 model, can be thought of as combining the extensions made in the Kimura80 and Felsenstein81 models. Namely, it distinguishes between the rate of transitions and transversions (using the κ parameter), and it allows unequal base frequencies (formula_118). [ Felsenstein described a similar (but not equivalent) model in 1984 using a different parameterization; that latter model is referred to as the F84 model. ]
Rate matrix formula_123
If we express the branch length, "ν" in terms of the expected number of changes per site then:
and formula for the other combinations of states can be obtained by substituting in the appropriate base frequencies.
T92 model (Tamura 1992).
T92, the Tamura 1992 model, is a mathematical method developed to estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site between two DNA sequences, by extending Kimura's (1980) two-parameter method to the case where a G+C content bias exists. This method will be useful when there are strong transition-transversion and G+C-content biases, as in the case of "Drosophila" mitochondrial DNA.
T92 involves a single, compound base frequency parameter formula_129 (also noted formula_130) formula_131
As T92 echoes the Chargaff's second parity rule — pairing nucleotides do have the same frequency on a single DNA strand, G and C on the one hand, and A and T on the other hand — it follows that the four base frequences can be expressed as a function of formula_130
formula_133 and formula_134
Rate matrix formula_135
The evolutionary distance between two DNA sequences according to this model is given by
where formula_137 and formula_138 is the G+C content (formula_139).
TN93 model (Tamura and Nei 1993).
TN93, the Tamura and Nei 1993 model, distinguishes between the two different types of transition; i.e. (formula_94) is allowed to have a different rate to (formula_95). Transversions are all assumed to occur at the same rate, but that rate is allowed to be different from both of the rates for transitions.
TN93 also allows unequal base frequencies (formula_118).
Rate matrix formula_143
GTR model (Tavaré 1986).
GTR, the Generalised time-reversible model of Tavaré 1986, is the most general neutral, independent, finite-sites, time-reversible model possible. It was first described in a general form by Simon Tavaré in 1986.
GTR parameters consist of an equilibrium base frequency vector, formula_144, giving the frequency at which each base occurs at each site, and the rate matrix
Where
formula_146
are the transition rate parameters.
Therefore, GTR (for four characters, as is often the case in phylogenetics) requires 6 substitution rate parameters, as well as 4 equilibrium base frequency parameters. However, this is usually eliminated down to 9 parameters plus formula_79, the overall number of substitutions per unit time. When measuring time in substitutions (formula_79=1) only 8 free parameters remain.
In general, to compute the number of parameters, one must count the number of entries above the diagonal in the matrix, i.e. for n trait values per site &lt;math&gt;

Anthimus of Naples

Anthimus or Anthemus was the Duke of Naples for from 801 until around 818, when the patrician of Sicily re-established Byzantine control over the "ducatus". Anthimus was, for most of his reign, independent of any higher authority, but he was losing control over his own subject cities, Gaeta and Amalfi.
Early in his reign, the patrician of Sicily requested his aid in fending off the Saracen pirates then ravaging the Sicilian coasts. Anthimus maintained his neutrality and refused. In 812, the Greek admiral sent to combat these corsairs requested aid from all the inhabitants of the Tyrrhenian coast, including those of Gaeta and Amalfi, who accepted, while Naples refused still. Thus, Naples subjects had declared their independence from her even as Naples was extracting itself from Byzantine suzerainty.

PNC Music Pavilion (originally Blockbuster Pavilion and formerly Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre) is an outdoor amphitheater in Charlotte, North Carolina, that specializes in hosting large concerts. The venue largely replaced the Paladium at Carowinds as the premier outdoor venue in the Metrolina region. It was renamed under a new naming rights deal with PNC Bank. It has a capacity of 19,500 (7,232 seats under pavilion, 2,221 reserved seats on lawn and 10,000 general admission seats).
The amphitheater is located on Pavilion Boulevard in the University City neighborhood near the US 29/I-485 (Outerbelt) interchange. The venue is operated by Live Nation, a concert company.
The amphitheater hosts many different varieties of acts, including rock, alternative, pop, country, jazz, and rhythm and blues, along with special events and festivals of all kinds.
Former Beatle Paul McCartney's final North American concert of The New World Tour was held at the amphitheater on June 15, 1993. The show was nationally broadcast on Fox, who aired commercials in place of some live songs.
The venue gained some notoriety in 2005, when Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran referred to the city of Charlotte as "Charlotte, Virginia".
The venue is a popular stop for summer tours, usually sandwiched between shows at Raleigh's Coastal Credit Union Music Park and Atlanta's Cellairis Amphitheatre, both of which are similarly sized venues. The Vans Warped Tour, Ozzfest and other traveling festivals generally always make an appearance here.

Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and Infirm

The Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and Infirm are a religious institute begun in 1929 by Mother Angeline Teresa (Bridget Teresa McCrory). The order is there to discern the differing needs of the aged, and to satisfy those needs to the best of their ability. At the Jubilee of Mother Angeline Teresa in 1964, she said that in the 1920s, while working among the aged in Brooklyn and Pittsburgh, she came to dislike the institutional flavor of existing homes, and sought to provide greater freedom for the residents.
History.
The congregation of the Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and Infirm was founded in 1929. Sister Angeline de St. Agatha McCrory was Superior of a Home of the Little Sisters of the Poor in the Bronx, New York. She felt that the European way and many of the customs in France did not meet the needs or customs of America. She also believed that old age strikes all classes of people, leaving them alone and frightened. Being unable to effect any necessary changes in her present situation, McCrory sought advice and counsel from Patrick Cardinal Hayes, the Archbishop of New York. The cardinal encouraged her in her work and suggested that she expand her ministry to include the aged throughout the New York City area.
With the blessing of Cardinal Hayes, McCrory and six other Sisters withdrew from the Little Sisters of the Poor and were granted permission from the Vatican to begin a new congregation for the care of the aged, incorporating Mother Angeline's ideals.
Mother M. Angeline Teresa, O. Carm., died in 1984 at the age of 91. On 28 June 2012, Pope Benedict XVI issued a decree declaring McCrory Venerable.
Innovations.
Her concept of cares for the aged was a pioneering one. The homes operated by the order added rehabilitation maintenance and recreation to the basic custodial care provided by homes for the aged. The homes allowed aged couples to share a room, unlike many homes, and sought to provide the atmosphere of a middle class private home. The goal was the maintenance of their dignity. The religious sisters also operated day care for the elderly of the neighborhood.
Present day.
The motherhouse of the congregation is St. Teresa's at Avila-on-Hudson in Germantown, New York. At present, there are approximately 110 Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and Infirm who operate 18 homes caring for elderly persons.

1023 Thomana

1023 Thomana, provisional designation , is a rare-type carbonaceous background asteroid from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 58 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 25 June 1924, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named after the St. Thomas Choir of Leipzig.
Classification and orbit.
"Thomana" orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8–3.5 AU once every 5 years and 8 months (2,058 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 10° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid's observation arc begins at Heidelberg, one night after its official discovery observation.
Physical characteristics.
In the Tholen classification, "Thomana" is an uncommon carbonaceous G-type asteroid.
Rotation period.
Between 2006 and 2009, three rotational lightcurves of "Thomana" were obtained from photometric observations by astronomers James W. Brinsfield, Pierre Antonini as well as René Roy and Laurent Bernasconi. Lightcurve analysis gave a concurring rotation period of 17.56 hours with a brightness variation between 0.27 and 0.36 magnitude ().
Spin axis.
In 2016, an international study modeled a lightcurve from various data sources with a period of 17.5611 hours and found two spin axis of (86.0°, −65.0°) and (272.0°, −42.0°), respectively, in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β) ().
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, "Thomana" measures between 53.28 and 61.34 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.05 and 0.065. The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is an albedo of 0.0649 and a diameter of 58.27 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.76.
Naming.
This minor planet was named by the discoverer after the St. Thomas Choir of Leipzig ("Thomanerchor"), a boys' choir at St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, Germany, where Johann Sebastian Bach used to work as music director.

1024 Hale

1024 Hale, provisional designation , is a carbonaceous background asteroid from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. The asteroid was discovered on 2 December 1923, by Belgian–American astronomer George Van Biesbroeck at the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin, United States. It was named for American astronomer George Ellery Hale. The dark C-type asteroid may have a rotation period of 16 hours.
Orbit and classification.
"Hale" is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.2–3.5 AU once every 4 years and 10 months (1,772 days; semi-major axis of 2.87 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.22 and an inclination of 16° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Yerkes Observatory with its first recorded observation in December 1928, or five years after its official discovery observation.
Physical characteristics.
"Hale" has been characterized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS photometric survey and by the SDSS-MFB (Masi Foglia Binzel). In the SMASS classification it is a "hydrated" Ch-subtype.
Rotation period.
In January 2013, a first rotational lightcurve of "Hale" was obtained from photometric observations by Michael S. Alkema at the Elephant Head Observatory in Arizona, United States. Analysis of the fragmentary lightcurve gave a rotation period of 16.0 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.10 magnitude (). As of 2018, no secure period has been obtained.
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, "Hale" measures between 28.46 and 51.37 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.0260 and 0.10.
The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" derives an albedo of 0.0496 and a diameter of 41.28 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.8.
Naming.
This minor planet was named after George Ellery Hale (1868–1938), a prolific American astronomer and pioneer of a new generation of large aperture telescopes, namely the 60-inch Hale and the 100-inch Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, as well as the 200-inch Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory. He founded the discovering Yerkes and Mount Wilson observatories and was their first director. Hale also founded "The Astrophysical Journal" and invented the spectroheliograph, which allowed to take monochromatic images of the Sun. The official naming citation was mentioned in "The Names of the Minor Planets" by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

De Lama's

De Lama's (translation: The Llamas) is a Dutch television show created by BNN and first aired on 26 June 2004. It is an adaptation of the Channel 4 show "Whose Line Is It Anyway?".
Patrick Lodiers hosts the show, which contains both well-known and more obscure elements of theatresports. The most important of these is improvisation.
De Lama's consist of the following comedians: Ruben Nicolai, Tijl Beckand, Ruben van der Meer and Jeroen van Koningsbrugge. Jandino Asporaat, Ad-Just Bouwman, Sara Kroos, Arie Koomen, Kristel Zweers and Martijn Oosterhuis are ex-"Lama's". Unlike the British and American series, every episode of De Lama's features a Guest Llama ("Gast Lama"), a well-known Dutch (or Belgian) person who offers suggestions for games and always joins the regulars for one or two games at the end.
At the end of 2006, regulars Sara Kroos and Arie Koomen left the show (the latter later returned for a single episode), leaving it with only three regular performers. To help alleviate this problem, broadcaster BNN organised a televised competition, "Lama Gezocht", in order to find a new performer to round out the team. Ad-Just Bouwman eventually won this competition, and joined the Llamas. Bouwman is no longer part of the troupe, reportedly because his artistic style didn't fit in with the other Llamas. Another recently 'llamafied' performer, Jandino Asporaat, left at around the same time to focus on his own theatre production, although rumor has it that his style clashed with the remaining three members as well. Jeroen van Koningsbrugge is the only new member to remain with the Llamas until the end.
In 2006, the show won the "Gouden Televizier-ring", a prestigious Dutch television award for the year's most popular program on TV as chosen by the audience. It was the first show broadcast by BNN (founded in 1997) to win the 'ring'.
On 4 April 2008, The Lama's announced they were going to quit with the TV-show. There was going to be one more season on TV and they planned a goodbye theatre tour through The Netherlands (and Belgium).
Trivia.
The name of the show originates from a remark the original team of Lama's used a lot: "hoor ik daar een lama schijten (of zei je wat)?", which translates roughly as "do I hear a llama taking a shit (or did you say something)?". The more-or-less matching joke in English would be "Does a llama shit in the woods?"

Ridge Road (Western New York)

Ridge Road is a east–west road that traverses four counties in Upstate New York in the United States. The road begins adjacent to the Niagara River at an intersection with Water Street in the village of Lewiston, Niagara County, and passes through several towns, villages, and the city of Rochester before arriving at its eastern terminus at a junction with New York State Route 370 (NY 370) southwest of Red Creek, Wayne County. It is named for the rise atop which the road was built, a mound of sand and gravel that was formed when it was the shoreline of ancient Glacial Lake Iroquois (now Lake Ontario). The ridge is often confused with the nearby Niagara Escarpment, which is much taller, geologic in origin, and lies a few miles to the south.
Most of the road is maintained by either the New York State Department of Transportation as a touring route or by county highway departments as a county road. of Ridge Road—over half of the road's total length—is part of NY 104, which joins the road outside of Lewiston and leaves it upon crossing the Genesee River in Rochester. From the Monroe–Wayne county line to Red Creek, Ridge Road is a two-lane, mostly county-owned road that parallels the NY 104 super two as both head eastward across Wayne County. Ridge Road is part of the Seaway Trail from its junction with NY 14 east of Sodus to its end at NY 370.
The road dates back to the 18th century when it was a foot trail used by the Algonquian and Iroquois. It developed into a dirt road in the early 19th century, and was modernized in the early 20th century when the state of New York took over the vast majority of the highway. The Porter–Rochester and Webster–Red Creek sections of Ridge Road were designated as part of Route 30, an unsigned legislative route, by 1921, and the latter section became part of the signed NY 3 in 1924. The piece of Route 30 west of Rochester was designated as part of NY 31 by 1926, and NY 31 was rerouted later in the decade to follow Ridge Road west from Porter to Lewiston. In Irondequoit, Ridge Road was unnumbered during the 1920s but designated as part of NY 18 in the early 1930s.
The myriad of designations were mostly replaced with one : U.S. Route 104 (US 104). NY 31 and NY 3 were moved off Ridge Road, while NY 18 became concurrent to US 104. Over the next half-century, however, the portion of US 104 (and later NY 104) from the Genesee River eastward was gradually relocated from Ridge Road to new expressways and freeways that were constructed in the vicinity of the old road. A section of NY 104's former routing along Ridge Road in Webster was retained as a state highway as part of NY 404; however, most of the old alignment was given to the counties or villages instead.
Route description.
Lewiston to Rochester.
The right-of-way of Ridge Road begins on the eastern bank of the Niagara River at the intersection of Center and Water streets in the village of Lewiston. Following Center Street east, the right-of-way meets NY 18F (at this point maintained by Niagara County as the unsigned County Route 907 or CR 907) four blocks later at 4th Street. Here, Center Street changes from a village street to a state-maintained highway as NY 18F joins Center Street east through the village to an interchange with the Robert Moses State Parkway and NY 104 in the shadow of the Niagara Escarpment. NY 18F and the Center Street name both end here, giving way to NY 104 and the Ridge Road moniker. East of this location, Ridge Road and NY 104 parallel the east–west running escarpment to its south as both entities head across western New York.
Most of Ridge Road between Lewiston and the city of Rochester to the east passes through rural, outlying areas of Niagara, Orleans, and western Monroe counties. While NY 31, a parallel highway to the south, passes through most of the region's largest communities—including the city of Lockport and the villages of Medina, Albion, and Brockport—Ridge Road and NY 104 bypass them entirely. Instead, the two-lane road passes through only small hamlets built up around junctions between NY 104 and other state routes. This changes in central Monroe County, however, where Ridge Road (known locally as West Ridge Road) is six to nine lanes wide as it serves as the backbone of a large commercial district in the town of Greece. Once in Rochester, West Ridge Road enters areas more residential and industrial in nature, including the sprawling Eastman Business Park near the Genesee River.
Rochester area.
At the Genesee River, NY 104 and West Ridge Road cross the Veterans Memorial Bridge and become an expressway on the east bank of the river. Ridge Road, however, continues to the north of NY 104 as East Ridge Road, which parallels the Keeler Street Expressway as both travel through the area. The latter begins at St. Paul Street a short distance south of Seneca Park Zoo and heads eastward as a city-maintained street, carrying NY 104 Truck through a residential section of the city. East Ridge Road crosses into the town of Irondequoit just east of Seneca Avenue, at which point it becomes county-maintained as CR 241. NY 104 Truck leaves to the south at Hudson Avenue, the first major intersection East Ridge Road has in Irondequoit.
Like in Greece, the Irondequoit portion of Ridge Road is lined with businesses ranging from big-box stores to small establishments. The road's status as an anchor for the town's economy is supported by the presence of a Wal-Mart supercenter on Hudson Avenue between NY 104 and East Ridge Road and Skyview on the Ridge, formerly known as both the Irondequoit Mall and Medley Center, located on East Ridge Road between North Goodman Street and Culver Road. Past Culver Road, the look along the four-lane East Ridge Road changes slightly as it gains a median while the surrounding neighborhood begins to shift from commercial to residential—a change ushered in by the presence of Eastridge High School. The divided highway, as well as CR 241, come to an end at NY 590 exit 11, the northernmost exit on the expressway. The exit is unorthodox in that the exit is bordered on both sides by NY 104, which is forced to parallel NY 590 for a short distance due to the composition of the area.
After passing over NY 104 westbound, under NY 590 and over NY 104 eastbound, East Ridge Road becomes a nondescript residential street as it enters the Irondequoit neighborhood of Newport. The East Ridge Road name ends at a junction with Bay Shore Boulevard—the only through-traffic road that East Ridge Road intersects east of NY 590—however, the street continues eastward as Binnacle Point to a cul-de-sac on a plateau overlooking Irondequoit Bay. Ridge Road itself does not traverse Irondequoit Bay; this task is accomplished by NY 404 at the southern tip of the bay, NY 104 via the Irondequoit Bay Bridge, and Culver and Lake Roads at the mouth of the bay via the Irondequoit Bay Outlet Bridge, a seasonal swing bridge that is open to traffic during the winter months only. This gap in Ridge Road is the only major discontinuity along its length.
Webster to Sodus.
Directly across the bay in the town of Webster, Ridge Road resumes at an intersection with Glen Edith Drive and Bay Road in an area of the town known as West Webster. Like East Ridge Road in the city of Rochester, this stretch of Ridge Road is locally maintained. State maintenance resumes one mile (1.6 km) to the east as Ridge Road merges with Empire Boulevard, which carries NY 404 into Webster from Penfield and Irondequoit. NY 404 takes on the Ridge Road name and heads east through the village of Webster to an intersection west of the Wayne County. Here, NY 404 vacates Ridge Road to follow Ridge Road Junction northeasterly down the escarpment—which Ridge Road runs on the edge of throughout most of its alignment in Webster—to NY 104. Ridge Road, in the meantime, becomes locally maintained for its remaining half-mile in Monroe County.
Upon crossing the county line, Ridge Road becomes county-maintained as CR 103. The route heads along the top of the escarpment, passing by a smattering of homes, while NY 104—visible from Ridge Road for most of the latter's routing through the town of Ontario—serves a line of businesses at the escarpment's base. The two roads, which run parallel to one another between the village of Webster and Ontario Center, begin to separate at NY 350 in Ontario Center. East of the hamlet, both Ridge Road and NY 104 enter a less-developed area of the county consisting of forests along NY 104 and fields adjacent to Ridge Road. Across the town line in Williamson, Ridge Road and NY 104 pass along opposite ends of Spencer Speedway prior to entering the hamlet of Williamson. Here, Ridge Road takes on the name Main Street as it passes east–west through the community and intersects NY 21 south of where it ends at NY 104.
The Ridge Road name returns outside the community; however, the fields do not as the road initially passes by a steady stream of homes on both sides of the highway. It briefly veers northward outside of Williamson, but returns to a more easterly routing ahead of East Townline Road and the Sodus town line. It is at the latter that the amount of development along Ridge Road finally decreases, giving way to slightly more open areas. In western Sodus, Ridge Road and NY 104 follow parallel, slightly northeasterly alignments that eventually lead both to the village of Sodus. Prior to reaching the village, both highways pass by Williamson–Sodus Airport, a local airport situated in between the two roads. Ridge Road continues on to the village, where it meets NY 88—which ends a short distance northwest of this point at NY 104—just west of the village limits. At this point, CR 103 ends while Ridge Road heads eastward, becoming state-maintained again as it follows NY 88 into Sodus.
Once inside the Sodus village limits, the name of the road changes to West Main Street. NY 88 remains on Main Street for two blocks to Carlton Street, at which point it turns southward onto Carlton Street and leaves Main Street as an unnumbered, village-maintained highway. The street continues eastward through the residential western portion of Sodus to the village's business district, where it intersects Maple Avenue and becomes East Main Street. It splits into two roads a block later: the upper road, which carries the East Main Street name and becomes known as Old Ridge Road outside of the village, climbs up the side of the escarpment while the lower road, State Street, runs along the base of the ridge. State Street itself splits two blocks later near a grade crossing with the Ontario Midland Railroad, with the eastern fork carrying the Ridge Road name.
East of Sodus.
Outside of Sodus, Ridge Road becomes CR 143 and parallels the Ontario Midland Railroad for just under before crossing the railroad at an oblique angle and intersecting NY 104. By crossing NY 104 here, Ridge Road moves to the north side of NY 104 for the first time since the start of East Ridge Road in Rochester and only the second time since the beginning of the road in Lewiston. Ridge Road runs parallel to NY 104 for a considerable distance through sparsely populated areas of the town of Sodus to the hamlet of Alton, where Ridge Road intersects NY 14 in its center. The state highway, which enters Alton from the north as part of the Seaway Trail, travels east for along Ridge Road before resuming its trek southward toward North Rose. The overlap creates a small gap in CR 143, which resumes at the east end of the concurrency.
While NY 14 leaves Alton to the south, the Seaway Trail follows Ridge Road as the latter breaks from NY 104 and takes a more northerly alignment into the town of Huron than the super two highway. Ridge Road heads eastward and northeastward across open fields to Sodus Bay, which the road crosses near its southern tip. East of the bay, Ridge Road passes through the small community of Resort before heading almost due eastward through extremely rural sections of Huron. About east of Sodus Bay, Ridge Road meets Lummisville Road (CR 155) at a junction northwest of the village of Wolcott. Ridge Road takes on Lummisville Road's northwest–southeasterly alignment and heads into Wolcott, losing the CR 143 designation and becoming the locally maintained West Main Street.
In Wolcott, the path of Ridge Road is known by several names as it traverses the industrial western half of the community—based around a spur of the Ontario Midland Railroad—and its residential eastern portion. It remains West Main Street until New Hartford Street, at which point it becomes just Main Street. One block later, Main Street splits into East Main Street and Mill Street, with Ridge Road following the latter northeast across Wolcott Creek. On the opposite bank of the creek, Mill Street meets Auburn Street, formerly the northernmost part of NY 89, and changes names one last time to Oswego Street. The street leaves Wolcott village on an easterly routing, becoming CR 163 and Ridge Road at the eastern village line.
Due east of Wolcott, Ridge Road intersects NY 104 for the last time in a heavily wooded area. On the other side of the super two, Ridge Road continues eastward for through a mostly undeveloped area of the town of Wolcott to an intersection with NY 370, where Ridge Road and CR 163 both terminate about southwest of the village of Red Creek. The right-of-way of Ridge Road continues northeastward as NY 370 westbound, and NY 370 and NY 104A carry the Seaway Trail into Red Creek.
History.
Origins and early designations.
The natural rise in the otherwise flat plains of northern Western New York was formed when sand and gravel were deposited at the shore of Glacial Lake Iroquois. This precursor to Lake Ontario, formed while the St. Lawrence River outlet was blocked by glacial ice, had a level about higher than the modern lake, which meant its southern shoreline was approximately south of the modern shore.
This ridge became the site of a pre-19th century trail carved out and used by the Algonquian and Iroquois. The path, known as the East and West Indian Trail, was initially just wide; however, it was gradually widened into a dirt road in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. One of the first areas to be improved was a section leading west from the Genesee River, which was widened by 1800. The trail was made passable from the Genesee River west to Lewiston in 1812; however, it was still a narrow, crude path with no bridges. In 1816, the state of New York paid $5,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to make the trail passable by wagons. By 1820, the trail was being used by daily stagecoaches. The trail was the main mode of transportation between the Genesee River and points west until the establishment of the Erie Canal in 1825, and later, railroads.
It was not until the early 1900s that the road saw major improvements, thanks to the increasing usage of the automobile. In 1908, the New York State Legislature established Route 30, an unsigned legislative route extending from Niagara Falls, Niagara County in the southwest to Rouses Point, Clinton County, in the northeast. Two sections of Ridge Road—from Porter (modern NY 429) to Ridgeway (NY 63) and from Rochester to Red Creek—were included as part of Route 30 at this time. Another section, from Ridgeway to the Orleans–Monroe county line, was added to Route 30's definition in 1914 as a spur route. On March 1, 1921, the mainline of Route 30 was realigned to follow Ridge Road between Ridgeway and the Rochester city line at Greece.
When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the segment of Route 30 from Rochester to Red Creek became part of NY 3. By 1926, all of legislative Route 30 west of Rochester was designated as part of NY 31. At the time, the entirety of Ridge Road outside of the city of Rochester was state-maintained; however, the piece west of Porter and the section in Irondequoit between the Genesee River and Irondequoit Bay were both unnumbered. The former became part of a realigned NY 31 in the late 1920s, while the latter became part of an extended NY 18 following the completion of the Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Genesee River.
US 104 was assigned across Upstate New York , extending from Niagara Falls to Maple View via Lewiston, Rochester, and Oswego. The new US route used the entirety of Ridge Road from Lewiston to Red Creek, save for small portions in and around the city of Rochester; as a result, NY 31 was shifted south onto most of its modern alignment while NY 3 was rerouted south of Watertown to follow what had been NY 3D. When US 104 was first assigned, it dipped south to serve downtown Rochester instead of bypassing it to the north. The route left Ridge Road at Lake Avenue and rejoined it at the junction of Empire Boulevard and Ridge Road in Webster. It was rerouted to continue east over the Veterans Memorial Bridge into Irondequoit, overlapping with NY 18 to the junction of East Ridge and Culver roads.
Construction of expressways.
Beginning in the 1940s, US 104 began to be moved from Ridge Road to expressways and super two highways constructed to bypass the numerous communities that had developed along Ridge Road east of Rochester. The first portion of the super two, extending from the Monroe–Wayne county line at Union Hill to west of Sodus, was opened to traffic in the mid-1940s. An extension of the highway around Sodus to NY 414 in Huron was built in the mid-1960s, resulting in US 104 being temporarily routed on Lake Bluff Road in between the end of the super two and Ridge Road. The remainder of the super two between Huron and Red Creek was finished in the early 1970s. In place of US 104, Ridge Road in Wayne County was designated as CR 103 west of NY 88, CR 143 between Sodus and Wolcott, and CR 163 from Wolcott to NY 370.
Similar conversion projects were also conducted elsewhere. In Irondequoit, the portion of the Sea Breeze Expressway (now NY 590) from Empire Boulevard to Culver Road opened in the late 1950s. US 104 and NY 18 were extended eastward along East Ridge Road to meet the expressway at what is now exit 11. To the southwest, the Keeler Street Expressway was built across Irondequoit in the mid-1960s and fully opened to traffic in late 1969. US 104 was moved from East Ridge Road to the expressway at that time, while NY 18 remained on East Ridge Road until it was truncated to its current eastern terminus in Rochester . East Ridge Road subsequently became CR 241.
The first segment of an eastward extension of the Keeler Street Expressway, named the Irondequoit–Wayne County Expressway, opened between the Sea Breeze Expressway and Five Mile Line Road. In between, US 104 crossed Irondequoit Bay by way of the Irondequoit Bay Bridge. US 104's former surface alignment between NY 47 and Five Mile Line Road was redesignated NY 404 while US 104 was temporarily realigned onto Five Mile Line Road to travel between the expressway and Ridge Road. US 104 was redesignated as NY 104 by the following year. NY 404 was gradually extended eastward along Ridge Road as new sections of the freeway opened to traffic. By 1978, it was extended to NY 250 in Webster after NY 104 was realigned onto the newly completed frontage roads between Five Mile Line Road and NY 250. NY 404 was extended to its current terminus in the early 1980s following the completion of the freeway from NY 250 to the Wayne County line in the late 1970s and the construction of the main carriageway of NY 104 between Five Mile Line Road and NY 250 in the early 1980s.
Major intersections.
Ridge Road is part of NY 18F in Lewiston, NY 104 from Lewiston east to the Genesee River in Rochester, and NY 404 in Webster. Intersections along those segments of Ridge Road can be found in the articles on those routes.

1025 Riema

1025 Riema, provisional designation , is a bright Hungaria asteroid from the innermost regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 12 August 1923, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named after ARI astronomer Johannes Riem.
Orbit and classification.
"Riema" is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 9 months (1,017 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 27° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid's observation arc begins at Heidelberg, four nights after its official discovery observation.
Physical characteristics.
In the Tholen classification, "Riema" is a bright E-type asteroid. In the SMASS taxonomy, it has been classified as a Xe-type, which transitions from the E to the X-types. In addition, the asteroid has also been polarimetrically characterized as a metallic M-type asteroid.
Lightcurves.
In August 2001, a first rotational lightcurve of "Riema" was obtained from photometric observations by Ukrainian astronomers at Kharkiv () and Simeiz (). Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 6.557 hours with a brightness variation of 0.25 magnitude ().
The Ukrainian team also determined the body's poles and axis-ratios. They found a spin axis of (141.0°, 11.0°) and (321.0.0°, −13.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β), as well as a semi-axis ratio of 3.41 (a/b) and 1.16 (b/c) for the three-axial ellipsoid model ().
Between 2003 and 2017, several additional lightcurves were obtained by American photometrists Robert Stephens and Brian Warner at the Santana Observatory (), the Palmer Divide Observatory () and the Palmer Divide Station (), respectively. The constructed lightcurve gave a shorter period for "Riema" between 3.566 and 3.588 hours with a low amplitude of 0.06 to 0.19 magnitude ().
Diameter and albedo.
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, "Riema" measures 4.605 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an outstandingly high albedo of 1.000. The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" assumes an albedo for E-type Hungaria asteroids of 0.40 – taken from 434 Hungaria, the family's largest member and namesake – and derives a diameter of 5.48 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.92.
Naming.
This minor planet was named after Johannes Karl Richard Riem (1868–1945), a German astronomer at the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI) in Berlin. The name was suggested by ARI. The official naming citation was published by Paul Herget in "The Names of the Minor Planets" in 1955 ().

Fools' Parade

Fools' Parade is a 1971 American crime drama period film directed by Andrew McLaglen, starring James Stewart and George Kennedy, with supporting roles by Strother Martin, Kurt Russell, William Windom, Mike Kellin and Anne Baxter. It is based on the novel of the same name by Davis Grubb. The film is also known as Dynamite Man from Glory Jail.
Plot.
In 1935, the one-eyed murderer, Mattie Appleyard, who refers to his obviously unmatched glass eye with the persona, "Tighe", bank robber Lee Cottrill, and a young convict named Johnny Jesus are released on the same day from the West Virginia State Penitentiary, located in the fictional town of Glory. Appleyard is issued a check for $25,452.32 for his 40 years of prison work, a substantial amount during the Great Depression. Appleyard and Cottrill have long been planning to establish and work together in their own independent retail grocery store, to be located in a distant West Virginia coal camp community where, at the time, was served by only a coal-company store.
All three of the released men are escorted by prison Captain and Sunday School teacher, "Doc" Council, to the local train station in the fictional Glory, West Virginia. Some time after departing from Glory on the train, Appleyard realizes that his check is redeemable only in person, back at the local bank in Glory. Council has previously plotted with Glory banker, Homer Grindstaff, to ensure that the check is never cashed, and accepts a cash advance from Grindstaff for the anticipated killing of Appleyard, Cottrill and Johnny Jesus. Council tells Grindstaff that this blood money will go, in part, toward missionary funding and vacation bible school.
Council and his accomplices, Steve Mystic and a "nice religious boy" and cracked ice-sucking radio singer named Junior Kilfong, travel to another train stop down the line to kill Appleyard, Cottrill and Johnny Jesus at night. Mystic has previously told Kilfong that Appleyard, Cottrill and Johnny Jesus are all atheists, and at a depot down the line from Glory, the uncertain Kilfong asks Mystic to confirm to him that the three released prisoners are atheists.
Informed of the plot by guilt-ridden conductor, Willis Hubbard, the three former prisoners thwart the plan. Kilfong shoots mining supply salesman, Roy K. Sizemore. Council kills the wounded Sizemore and places the blame on Appleyard, who escapes with Sizemore's supply of dynamite.
The next day, Council goes to the bank to update Grindstaff. As they talk, Appleyard walks in with some of the dynamite strapped to his chest, and the remainder in a suitcase. Appleyard threatens to blow them all up, "and half this city block", if the banker does not cash his check. Grindstaff reluctantly complies.
Appleyard and his friends, who followed him back to Glory, split up, planning to meet again later. While waiting at the rendezvous, Cottrill is talked into boarding a houseboat owned by a down-on-her-luck prostitute named Cleo for a drink of whiskey. Also aboard is Chanty, a sixteen-year-old who Cleo has taken in, hoping to sell her virginity for $100.
Appleyard and Johnny show up, but are tracked down by Council and his bloodhound. The three friends get away in a skiff, leaving behind the suitcase of dynamite. Johnny is worried about what Council will do to Chanty, so they turn around and go back when Council leaves.
Before leaving, Council tells Cleo about Appleyard's money. At gunpoint, Appleyard gives her the suitcase that she believes contains the money, in exchange for Chanty. After they leave, Cleo tries to shoot open the locked suitcase, and blows up the houseboat, killing herself. The fugitives become trapped on a boxcar by Council. The train is a "fools' parade", as described by Appleyard, going nowhere beyond the local train yard. Luckily for them, guilt-ridden train conductor Willis Hubbard returns and helps them escape. However, he is too afraid of Council to tell the police what he knows.
Council, Mystic and Kilfong track them to an abandoned house. Council decides that he does not want to share the loot, so he kills his two confederates. He shoots out a window, wounding Appleyard. Johnny throws a stick of dynamite at Council, but Council's bloodhound fetches it and brings it back. Appleyard hastily throws it out of the window, killing Council.
The men are arrested, and Appleyard's money is confiscated, but Hubbard confesses the truth, and Grindstaff is arrested. Appleyard and his friends are exonerated, and Appleyard is allowed to cash his check.
Production.
"Fools' Parade" was filmed entirely in Marshall County, West Virginia. Davis Grubb, author of "Fools' Parade", was born and raised in Moundsville, where most of the filming took place. The production crew used the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad throughout filming, mainly at the Moundsville station, which was demolished in 1980.
Reception.
Tony Mastroianni of the "Cleveland Press" said that it "leans heavily on Stewart's skill, personality and built-in folksiness. Time and again he gives you the impression of an interesting character that really isn't there in the role."
From the review at the UK website, The Movie Scene: "James Stewart ... is central to the movie working, but it also features some nice and unexpected performances from the other stars such as Kurt Russell and George Kennedy. It also has a surprisingly good storyline which has a couple of layers of unexpected depth. Yet because some of it is played out for laughs it left me unsure...the light-hearted moments (seem) a bit strange..."

Charley Schanz

Charles Murrell Schanz (June 8, 1919 – May 28, 1992) was an American professional baseball player, a pitcher whose career extended for 17 seasons (1938–54). He appeared in Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia Phillies (1944–47) and Boston Red Sox (1950). The , right-hander was a native of Anacortes, Washington.
Schanz had a successful rookie season (13–16, 3.32, for the last place 1944 Phillies) but was relatively ineffective after that, posting a 5.03 ERA in his last four years. He made his big league debut on April 20, 1944, starting and losing 8–2 to the Brooklyn Dodgers at Shibe Park. His first major league win came in his second start five days later, a 12-inning 4–3 home victory over the New York Giants. He pitched his first major-league shutout on September 3, 1945 vs. the Boston Braves in the second game of a home doubleheader. The score was 5–0.
Schanz's key pitch was his fastball. A 1949 issue of the "Pacific Coast Baseball News" put it plainly: "Charley is fast – very fast ..."
Schanz had a tendency to be wild, as he finished in the league's top ten for the following categories: bases on balls allowed (1944 and 1945), wild pitches (1944 and 1946), and hit batsmen (1944, 1945, and 1946). One highlight as a relief pitcher, however, was finishing in the top ten for saves three straight seasons (1944–1946).
Career MLB totals for 155 games pitched include a 28–43 record, 72 games started, 23 complete games, 2 shutouts, 49 games finished, and 14 saves. He allowed 302 earned runs in 626 innings pitched for an ERA of 4.34. During his long minor league career (1938–43; 1948–54), Schanz appeared in 455 games and fashioned a 145–144 (3.96) record in 2,510 innings of work. He won 22 games for the 1949 Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League.
Schanz died at the age of 72 in Sacramento, California.

Seymour S. Kety

Seymour S. Kety (August 25, 1915 – May 25, 2000) was an American neuroscientist who was credited with making modern psychiatry a rigorous and heuristic branch of medicine by applying basic science to the study of human behavior in health and disease. After Kety died, his colleague Louis Sokoloff noted that: "He discovered a method for measuring blood flow in the brain, was the first scientific director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and produced the most-definitive evidence for the essential involvement of genetic factors in schizophrenia."
Childhood.
Semyour S. Kety was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1915. Raised in a humble family household in Philadelphia, Kety was intellectually challenged and stimulated. As a child, Kety was involved in a car accident that injured his foot. Though he could still walk, Kety remained slightly physically impaired.
Schooling.
For his education, Kety stayed in his home town of Philadelphia. Kety attended Central High School in Philadelphia and found himself excelling greatly in chemistry. Running his own experiments in his homemade laboratory, Kety found a passion for chemistry. Throughout high school, he pursued his interest in the physical sciences and also gained knowledge of both Greek and Latin. Kety attended college and medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, from which he graduated in 1940. He did a rotating internship at the Philadelphia General Hospital, but that was the extent of his clinical training. After finishing his internship, Kety went into research.
Kety's first contribution to science.
During his internship, he married Josephine Gross, a childhood friend. She too was studying to be a doctor. Josephine wanted to be a pediatrician, which inspired Seymour to do research and study more about children. An increase in lead poisoning led to Kety's first contribution to medicine. More and more children came down with lead poisoning because they were chewing on their cribs, coated in paint containing lead. Seymour began to think about citrate to relieve the children of their lead poisoning. Citrate would help flush the lead out of the children's systems through urination. Called a chelating agent, citrate was the first thing used to help treat heavy metal intoxication.
Kety's slow transition to psychology.
Following his internship, Kety decided to continue his research of lead poisoning. The National Research Council post-doctorate fellowship, received by Kety to continue his research, began in 1942. Kety worked under the supervision of lead poisoning specialist Joseph Charles Aub. Only after Seymour arrived prepared to start his fellowship did he learn that Aub changed his area of study — he was now working with traumatic and hemorrhagic shock. Joseph Aub changed his work to study the shock because it was a time of war, and the research was pressing. While working with Aub, Kety found the circulation of the heart to be fascinating. Instead of returning to Harvard, Kety went to his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania. While back in Pennsylvania, Seymour worked with Carl Schmidt, an expert in cerebral circulation. Kety became a pharmacology instructor at the university.
Commonly known as a great teacher, Seymour was very popular among his students. Soon, everyone that knew Kety learned that he had a profound interest in cerebral circulation. His desire for knowledge was mostly to understand the process and to measure the flow of blood. Eventually, Kety and Schmidt worked together to form experiments about the cerebral circulation in a human. In time, they found a very effective method of measuring the flow of blood. Their work together was revolutionary.
After collaborating with many doctors on various projects, Seymour S. Kety became the chairman of the department of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University in 1961. After only one year, Kety resigned due to his lack of experience in psychiatry. He returned to his job as the Chief of Laboratory Science. Seymour, however, continued the research he was working on. He was researching the causes of schizophrenia. His focus was based on the genetic influences that cause the disease.
Kety's results.
Seymour spent much of his life studying schizophrenia. He said that genetic influences may be largely responsible for psychosis, comparing it to phenylketonuria or Huntington's disease. Kety's discoveries have been used and further developed into new theories. In 1959, Kety got interested in Paul Wender's work at the St Elizabeth's Hospital. They applied the so called Danish-American adoption study of schizophrenia methodology, where they compared data from biological and adoptive parents of schizophrenic children, and successfully linked schizophrenia to genetic causes. The first well-controlled test was presented in 1967 at the Transmission of Schizophrenia meeting, organized by Kety.
Seymour Kety's legacy.
Kety had three major contributions in three different areas. In psychiatry, Kety discovered the strong link between genetics and the staggering disease of schizophrenia. As a physiologist, Seymour studied cerebral circulation and made advancements in the field. Kety's work with neuroscience was also a large accomplishment.
Kety was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.
In 1981, Kety became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.
He never trained in psychiatry although he changed its course. In 1986, he was awarded the Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience. In 1988 Kety and Louis Sokoloff were jointly awarded the NAS Award in the Neurosciences from the National Academy of Sciences. Kety also received awards from some of the most prestigious scientific groups, including the American Society of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Association.

Maine State Route 4

State Route 4 (SR 4) is a long state highway located in southern and western Maine. It is a major interregional route and the first such route to be designated in the state. The southern terminus is at the New Hampshire border in South Berwick, where it connects to New Hampshire Route 4, and the northern terminus is at Haines Landing on Mooselookmeguntic Lake in Rangeley. Major cities and towns along the length of SR 4 include Sanford, Gorham, Windham, Auburn and Farmington.
Route description.
South Berwick to Alfred.
SR 4 begins at the New Hampshire state line where NH 4 crosses into South Berwick. It has a brief concurrency with SR 236 in the downtown area before splitting off to the northeast. SR 4 runs in a northeasterly direction paralleling the Downeaster right of way into North Berwick, where it junctions with SR 9 and has a concurrency through the town, then turns nearly due north. SR 4 passes through the city of Sanford, bypassing the downtown area to the east. It meets SR 4A (a former alignment of SR 4) and SR 109 at a traffic circle, with those routes providing downtown access. Continuing north into Alfred, SR 4 junctions with U.S. Route 202 (US 202), SR 4A and SR 111.
Alfred to Auburn (concurrency with US 202).
US 202 east joins SR 4 north and the two routes begin a lengthy concurrency. Entering Waterboro, US 202 and SR 4 meet SR 5, turning east to join SR 5 into Lyman before splitting off to the northeast. Continuing into Hollis, a separate segment of SR 4A begins as the highway crosses SR 35, and SR 117 joins US 202 and SR 4 to form another three-way concurrency. The road crosses the Saco River into Buxton, and SR 117 immediately splits off to the south. US 202 and SR 4 bypass downtown Buxton to the south, with access available via SR 112 and the east end of the SR 4A loop. The highway crosses SR 22 on the way out of town. Entering the town of Gorham, US 202 and SR 4 cross SR 112 again before entering the downtown area and junction with SR 25, a major interregional route connecting to Portland and points west. The three routes are cosigned along Main Street, crossing SR 114 in the center of town. Continuing northeast, US 202 and SR 4 split from SR 25, then cross SR 237 before crossing the Presumpscot River into Windham. In Windham, the highway passes through the town center before intersecting with US 302 at a traffic circle. Continuing northeast, US 202 and SR 4 are joined by SR 115 as they cross into the town of Gray. The highway meets SR 26A, a bypass of Gray Village, then interchanges with Interstate 95 (the Maine Turnpike) at exit 63. SR 26A is cosigned with US 202, SR 4 and SR 115 into the village center, forming a short four-route concurrency. In the village, the highway junctions with SR 26 and SR 100, both major interregional routes. SR 115 splits off here and SR 100 north joins US 202 and SR 4. Now paralleling I-95 to its east, the highway continues through New Gloucester, where it meets the northern end of SR 231, and then into the city of Auburn. US 202, SR 4 and SR 100 enter Auburn as Washington Street and meet the eastern end of SR 122 before interchanging with I-95 again at exit 75. Crossing the Little Androscoggin River and continuing towards downtown, the highway meets SR 11 and SR 121 at a rotary intersection. Continuing north onto Minot Avenue, SR 11 joins US 202, SR 4 and SR 100 for into downtown Auburn. At Court Street, US 202 turns east along with SR 11 and SR 100 towards Lewiston, leaving SR 4 after a concurrency.
Auburn to Farmington.
SR 4 continues north on Union Street and then Center Street and Turner Road, staying on the Auburn side of the Androscoggin River. SR 4 has an interchange with the Veterans Memorial Bridge Connector freeway and continues due north into the town of Turner. SR 4 crosses the Nezinscot River and SR 117 again near the town's center. SR 4 crosses SR 219 in the northeast corner of town before continuing into Livermore, where it has a short concurrency with SR 108. SR 4 does cross the Androscoggin River into Livermore Falls, where it junctions with SR 17 in the downtown area. SR 4 and SR 17 are cosigned north into the town of Jay, where they run along the east bank of the river to an intersection with SR 140. In North Jay, SR 4 splits from SR 17 and continues north into Wilton, where it junctions with US 2. SR 4 turns east to join US 2 and the two routes bypass downtown Wilton, with access via SR 156. Continuing into the town of Farmington, US 2 and SR 4 gradually turn north towards downtown, intersecting with SR 133 south of town. In downtown Farmington, SR 43 joins from the west and the road crosses the Sandy River to junction with SR 27. US 2 turns south onto SR 27 while SR 4 and SR 43 join SR 27 north.
Farmington to Rangeley.
Continuing north out of downtown Farmington, SR 43 splits off to the east, with SR 4 and SR 27 maintaining a northward course along the Sandy River. A few miles to the north, SR 27 splits off to the northeast, while SR 4 turns northwest and junctions with SR 149 before crossing the Sandy River again. In the town of Strong, SR 4 and SR 149 straddle opposite sides of the river as it proceeds north, then turns west. Both routes junction with SR 145 near the center of town, and continue west through Avon and into Phillips. In Phillips, SR 149 crosses the river and terminates at SR 142. SR 142 has a concurrency with SR 4 before splitting off to the west. SR 4 continues northwest along the Sandy River, passing through a series of unincorporated townships and plantations without any major junctions. SR 4 runs along the east side of Rangeley Lake as it enters the town of Rangeley and junctions with SR 16. SR 4 turns west and joints SR 16, running along the north side of the lake into the town center, before SR 16 splits off to the north. Crossing the Rangeley River into downtown, SR 4 has its last major northbound junction at the western end of SR 17. The road continues west until it dead-ends at Haines Landing on Mooselookmeguntic Lake.
History.
Background of interregional route experiment.
When the modern state highway system was first implemented in Maine in 1925, all state highways which did not cross state lines were assigned numbers 100 and up. This was to avoid conflicts with the New England road marking system, which had been adopted in the other New England states in 1922. All of the New England routes used one- or two-digit numbers that were retained across state lines. The New England route system was supplanted in 1926 by the U.S. Numbered Highway System, but the New England routes that did not become U.S. Routes were redesignated as state highways with the existing numbers. These numbering conventions were used regardless of a route's length, so interregional travel that did not involve the New England interstate routes or new U.S. Routes could involve using several different three-digit routes.
In 1931, the Maine State Highway Commission sought to rectify this problem by conducting an experiment in which it would designate a new low-numbered state highway which ran mostly on existing alignments of the original 1925 three-digit intrastate routes, replacing and/or overlapping the original numbers along those alignments. This would effectively create a long interregional route that could cover an important travel corridor with a single route number. SR 4 was the first interregional route to be designated as part of this experiment. The number 4 was chosen because the route was originally intended to be a northward extension of US 4 from Dover, New Hampshire, but the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) never accepted the proposal and US 4 was ultimately routed south and east to its present terminus in Portsmouth. Despite this, the project ultimately proved to be a success and the new route was kept in place. The interregional routes were expanded in 1933-34 with a state-wide renumbering, including several other new route designations being introduced, and some of the original New England routes being given longer routings (the most significant of those being SR 11).
Original route of SR 4 and subsequent changes.
As first designated in 1931, SR 4 extended from its present terminus at the New Hampshire state line to the Coburn Gove-Woburn Border Crossing, running the entire length of western Maine. It was designated on a new routing between South Berwick and North Berwick. From North Berwick, it replaced former SR 214 which extended into downtown Sanford at SR 109, then was cosigned with SR 11 (which, at the time, still ran east to Biddeford) to Alfred at SR 4A (which, at the time, bypassed Sanford to the east). From there, it displaced former SR 111 which ran as far as the SR 25 junction in Gorham. A new routing was used from Gorham to Gray, then SR 4 was cosigned with existing SR 115 and SR 100 into Auburn. From Auburn, SR 4 replaced SR 107 which extended to Rangeley as SR 4 does today, except for the short extension to Haines Landing which SR 4 did not initially occupy. This short section of road became part of SR 16 in 1933, then was designated as a second iteration of SR 144 in 1936. From the town center of Rangeley, SR 4 replaced former SR 144 (modern SR 16, not related to the "new" SR 144 in Rangeley) which ran northeast to Eustis, and a new routing along local roads (modern SR 27) to the Quebec border crossing. When SR 16 was designated in 1933-34, it was cosigned with SR 4 from Rangeley to Eustis, meeting the northern end of the newly designated SR 27 in Eustis.
In 1937-38, US 202 (designated in 1936) and SR 4 were moved from their original alignment in Hollis, Bar Mills, and Buxton onto a bypass alignment to the south. The original alignment became the northern segment of SR 4A.
In 1946-47, SR 4 was truncated to its junction with SR 16 on the east side of Rangeley, eliminating the overlap between the two routes. SR 27 was extended north from its original terminus in Eustis north to the Canadian border along the original alignment of SR 4. Around the same time, the designations of SR 4 and SR 4A in Sanford were swapped, with SR 4 assuming the eastern bypass route and SR 4A running west into downtown with SR 109, then north to Alfred along US 202.
In 1951, SR 4 was again cosigned with SR 16 along the north side of Rangeley Lake, then extended west to Haines Landing, replacing the second iteration of SR 144.
Auxiliary routes.
State Route 4A (abbreviated SR 4A) is the designation for two separate, but closely located, auxiliary routes of SR 4. Both are former alignments of SR 4 and loop to meet their parent highway at both ends. While not directly connected to one another, they are linked by a stretch of US 202 and SR 4 between Hollis and Buxton. The combined length of both segments is .
Southern segment.
The southern segment of SR 4A runs for between the towns of Sanford and Alfred, and is a service route for downtown Sanford, which SR 4 bypasses to the east.
This segment of SR 4A begins at an intersection with SR 4 and SR 109 south of downtown. SR 4A and SR 109 run concurrently northwest into the center of town, where they intersect with US 202 and SR 11 at Lebanon and Winter Streets. SR 109 continues straight to join SR 11, while SR 4A turns onto Winter Street to join US 202. US 202 and SR 4A run concurrently to the northeast, crossing SR 224 (another bypass of downtown Sanford), then cross into Alfred where they intersect with SR 4 and SR 111. SR 4A ends at this intersection, US 202 turns north to join SR 4 and SR 111 begins to the east.
This segment of SR 4A was part of the original 1931 alignment of SR 4 through Sanford. The northern segment was partially cosigned SR 11 until 1933, and then overlapped by US 202 when it was designated in 1936. The southern segment has always been cosigned with SR 109. An eastern bypass of Sanford was constructed in the late 1930s and finished by 1941, at which time it was given the SR 4A designation. The SR 4 and SR 4A designations were then swapped in 1946-47, with SR 4 assuming the newer bypass alignment and SR 4A assuming the older alignment through downtown Sanford. As a result, the entire length of this segment of SR 4A is overlapped by other routes.
Northern segment.
The northern segment of SR 4A runs for between Hollis and Buxton and is a northern alternate to US 202/SR 4. Like the southern segment, this segment is signed north-south, but is oriented nearly due west to east.
This segment begins at an intersection between US 202 / SR 4 and SR 35 in Hollis. SR 4A and SR 35 share a brief concurrency before SR 4A splits off to the east, crossing SR 117 in the process. The highway continues to the east into the town of Buxton. SR 4A then crosses SR 112 before terminating at US 202/SR 4.
This segment of SR 4A is a former alignment of both US 202 and SR 4, which were moved to a southern bypass alignment in 1937-38.
Mileposts on this section of SR 4A continue from the southern segment, omitting the connecting section of US 202/SR 4.

Robert Post (journalist)

Robert Perkins Post (September 8, 1910 – February 26, 1943) worked as a reporter for the "New York Times" during World War II. He was part of a group of eight reporters, known as the Legion of the Doomed or the Writing 69th, selected to fly bomber missions with United States Eighth Air Force.
Early life.
Post was the son of a well-to-do New York lawyer; his family summered in a mansion called Strandhome on Long Island's Great South Bay. He decided to become a journalist while attending St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, and got his start working at the New York Evening World only a few weeks after graduating. While attending Harvard, Post spent his summer vacations working at various publications including the "Putnam Patriot" and the "New York World".
Career.
Upon graduation from Harvard in 1932, Post took a position with the "Boston American", and in 1933 he applied for a job with Arthur Krock, the head of the "New York Times" Washington bureau, as a junior correspondent. Krock, after telling Post to do it the hard way and work his way up, offered him a position as an office boy running messages for the phone operator. He took it. Post, however, briefly left Washington for New York City, where he worked on Fiorello H. La Guardia's mayoral re-election campaign and, simultaneously, his brother Langdon Ward Post's bid for borough president. After his brother lost, Post returned to Washington.
Post was in the "Times" Washington bureau from 1934 to 1938, working as a White House correspondent in 1936 and 1937. In 1935 he married Margaret "Margot" Lapsley in Brooklyn, Connecticut. After honeymooning in the West Indies, Post and his new wife settled in Washington while he worked at the "Times". While in Washington, Post built a friendship with then President Franklin Roosevelt.
One of the more well known anecdotes revolving around Post and FDR involved the all-important question of whether or not Roosevelt would seek a third term. At a press conference Post asked FDR about his intentions to which Roosevelt gave a nonchalant reply and joked about the weather. Undeterred, Post pressed him on the issue. More than a little annoyed FDR retorted, "Bob, go put on the dunce cap and stand in the corner." As Roosevelt exited the press conference he gave Post a thumbs down. The press had quite the field day with the incident and used it as a microcosm on FDR dodging or ignoring important questions. Three years later FDR was indeed nominated for a third term and accepted. Post sent him a congratulatory message that said, "Who's the dunce now?"
In December 1937 Post found out he was to be moved to London. In London he reported on the Battle of Britain. He filed a number of stories on that battle and used to sit on Shakespeare Cliff, west of Dover and watch air battles unfold. As a firsthand witness to the bombing of London he put into words what he saw after a German air raid destroyed Commons Chamber of the Houses of Parliament and blew the roof off Westminster Abbey.
The sun rose red over London yesterday after one of the worst air raids that London has experienced. Weary and drawn after a night of horror and fire – a night that even women living alone spent in putting out incendiaries – London began to make a preliminary reckoning of what happened... It is perhaps not important to the historian that little shops have been blasted or that a street of little homes has been destroyed: but it is vital to men who own and work in those shops and live in those houses. But Londoners recovering from this raid – and though it was bad it is too early yet to say that it was one of the worst in history – felt a savage satisfaction when they read in their papers or heard on their radios that thirty-three raiders had been shot down, four by anti-aircraft fire and twenty-nine by fighters. It was good news and it would probably have been better news if all the speculation had been told, because it is probable that many more Nazi planes were damaged or brought down. Some speculations go far beyond the official figure and in any case it was a very fair percentage of the total raiders over England.
– Robert Perkins Post, "New York Times", May 12, 1941
By the early 1940s the Times London bureau included bureau chief Raymond "Pete" Daniell, Tania Long (who later married Daniell), David Anderson, Hal Denny, Walter Leysmith, Jamie MacDonald, Drew Middleton, James Reston, and Post. After a Sept. 7, 1940 air raid destroyed their headquarters, Daniell moved the staff to the Savoy Hotel, where many journalists had gathered after the fall of France.
Post was one of the first reporters to file the story of Rudolf Hess parachuting into Scotland in May 1941. He likened Hess' arrival to "something out of a mystery thriller." Post was one of the eight reporters who trained with the United States Eighth Air Force in 1943 in order to fly along on B-24 and B-17 Flying Fortress bomber missions into Germany. After a week of high-altitude training Post flew his first mission on a B-24 Liberator on February 26, 1943. During the raid Post's aircraft encountered German fighter aircraft and was shot down over Oldenburg, Germany. Post and most of the crew did not survive the encounter.
The Writing 69th.
In February 1943 Post stunned two friends with the admission that he thought he was going to die. He had been selected to accompany bomber missions with the 8th U.S. Air Force and would soon be departing for Germany. Post's friends, actress Leonora Corbett and war correspondent Helen Millbank of the "Chicago Daily News", tried to reassure him, but Post insisted he wasn't coming back.
At the time, Post had been trying to hitch a ride on a bomber for two years, first with the RAF and later with the U.S. Army Air Force. He and the other journalists trained with the Air Force for a week, learning relevant skills such as adjustment to high-altitude flying, parachuting and weapons use. After the training period the Writing 69th were assigned to their first mission.
Members.
The seven members of the 69th and their affiliation besides Post:
In addition to the writers of the 69th five newsreel cameramen took part in the training with the Writing 69th. They and their affiliations were:
Death.
Post belonged to the elite group of eight journalists participating in what was known as "The Flying Typewriters", "Legion of the Doomed", or "The Writing 69th". The first and last mission for the 69th would come on February 26, 1943. An American group of B-24s and B-17s were dispatched to take out the Focke-Wulf aircraft factory in Bremen, Germany. The skies over Bremen were overcast and the bombing run had to be diverted to a secondary target, the submarine pens at Wilhelmshaven.
Of the eight journalists who comprised the Legion of the Doomed, six went on that mission: Post, Cronkite, Rooney, Wade, Bigart, and Hill. Over Oldenburg, Germany, the group encountered German fighters. Post's B-24 was shot down and exploded in mid-air. Eight Air Force crew members were killed along with Post. The other planes returned safely, though the plane Rooney was on sustained some flak damage. Post's death effectively ended the days of reporters flying on bombing missions. Others, including Scott and Manning (who both missed the Wilhelmshaven raid), did fly after Post's mission, but it was not nearly as common after Post's death. Post is buried in the Ardennes American Cemetery at Neuville-en-Condroz, Belgium.
Upon hearing of Post's loss, an officer at the 44th Bomb Group wrote:
During the ten days he was here, Post won the confidence of all men and officers. They recognized his sincerity and his courage, for they constantly go through the same dangers themselves and they know the odds. He came at a time when the group had been badly shot up, when our losses had been heavy, when it seemed few people appreciated what they were suffering. Bob Post got close to our men. They poured out their story to him and felt his purpose was to help them win the war. It encouraged them to have the feeling that the people of the United States would be given a true picture of what they were trying to do and what must be done at home if democracy is to survive.
One of the two crew members who did survive the explosion, Second Lieutenant Wayne Gotke, later wrote about the experience after he was released from a German POW camp. The mission was unique because of the large number of firsthand accounts from the reporters. The German fighter pilot who shot down the bomber, Heinz Knoke, wrote about the incident in a book, "I Flew for the Führer", after the war.

Ernests Blanks

Ernests Blanks ( in Braslava, Valmiera County, Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire – 31 January 1972 in Palma, Majorca, Spain), publicist, the first to publicly advocate for Latvia's independence in 1917.
Ernests Blanks was editorial writer of "Dzimtenes Atbalss" (Fatherland's Echo). At a time when others discussed the autonomy of Latvia and the other Baltic countries, Ernests Blanks dared to demand sovereignty for Latvia. Already on Ernests Blanks unequivocally wrote: "Our ideal is a sovereign Latvia." After the state of Latvia had been established he reminded that the Latvians had regained their long lost freedom. For some time he was a deputy of the first Parliament Tautas Padome, which preceded the Saeima. He wrote about the Saeima, but mostly about the Latvian National Awakening and its activists. He was one of them, but discreet about his own role. He is the author of about 700 editorials on Latvian national political issues (alone), and at least 15 books. Blanks devoted his life to defending the sovereignty of the state of Latvia through his writings. Thus, during the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, he was a persona non grata in his country.
Biography.
Blanks was born on in Braslava municipality in Valmiera County, Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire. His parents were leaseholders until the family moved to Riga where he attended school. Starting in 1914, he studied history and philosophy at the Shanyavskiy University in Moscow as an unenrolled student. He was one of the leaders of the Latvian National Democratic Party (LNDP). In Latvia, Blanks was editor of numerous newspapers and journals, and published papers in even more. He was honoured with the Three-Star Order (of the 4th class) of Latvia in 1928. In 1945, Blanks fled in exile to Germany where he continued the editorial and publishing work. He died in exile January 31, 1972 in Palma de Mallorca, Spain.

Dini Dimakos

Dini Dimakos is a Canadian stand-up comedian.
Early life.
Dimakos was born in Toronto of Greek descent and was raised in the rural town of Shelburne, Ontario, an hour north of Toronto. Her family ran a restaurant in the nearby town of Primrose, Ontario. She began working at the restaurant as a seating hostess, dishwasher and garlic bread cook at the age of 6, during the 1980s. Her family later sold the restaurant to relatives and opened another restaurant down the street in 1991.
Dimakos later attended Centre Dufferin District High School and starred in productions of "Guys and Dolls" and "Bye, Bye Birdie". She graduated with honours and continued on with a partial scholarship to York University.
Performing career.
Radio.
In the late 1990s Dimakos began interning at a Brampton, Ontario radio station called Hot 103.5 FM, which would later be known as Hits 103.5 FM, and currently "Z 103.5" (CIDC), (Evanov Group LTD). The station specialized in dance music and Top 40 hits. Within a month of interning, Dimakos was hired on as a Promotions Assistant. While at a concert, Dini performed an impromptu live on-air cut in. This led to weekend stints as an on-air personality, broadcasting live on location. Eventually she was filling in on the morning show as a co-host while radio personality Elvira Caria was on maternity leave. Her experience as a morning show co-host was further enhanced by working along with the host of the show Darrin "Big D" Laidman.
Television production.
After her time in radio, Dimakos began to take interest in television broadcasting. She volunteered her time at "2001 Canadian Comedy Awards", which led to a chance meeting with television personality and comedian Mista Mo, who co-starred in the television show "Buzz" and on The Comedy Network. Having a keen interest in Canadian television and how a comedy show was produced, Dimakos was soon hired as a Production Assistant on Buzz by MTR Entertainment. She worked on the show from seasons 3 to 6. She was later promoted to the Senior Production Coordinator on seasons 5 and 6.
Improvisation and stand-up beginnings.
During this time, Dimakos was attending improv classes at The Second City in Toronto and began writing stand-up material. She partook in a week long stand-up comedy workshop at Humber College in 2003 under the guidance of veteran comedians Larry Horowitz and Mike MacDonald. This was a life-altering time for Dini as she found a love for writing and performing stand-up comedy. She quickly signed up for amateur nights at the Yuk Yuk's Comedy Club in Toronto, Ontario. She also began performing on the open mike circuit in the Toronto area.
MuchMusic "Video on Trial".
Dimakos may be best known for her work, from 2006 to 2013, on MuchMusic. She was a series regular for network's hit show, "Video on Trial", featuring on over 20 episodes along with the likes of Canadian comedians Russell Peters, Debra DiGiovanni and Trevor Boris.
MuchMusic "Stars Gone Wild".
MuchMusic launched a new show in September 2007, "Stars Gone Wild". The show blasted current celebrities by a menagerie of colorful characters. Dini appeared on several episodes respectively as "Posy Perennial", "Matthew the Emo Girl", "Dr. Pat McGroin", "Belinda Belissima", "Chandelier W. Bush" (girlfriend of Boomer Phillips' character Lance Sherbourne), "Rhonda the Housewife" and most popularly as the daring nun, "Sister Siobhan O'Shepardspie". The series was one of the highest rated shows on the network.
"Much on Demand".
In October 2007, Dini was interviewed live on "Much on Demand" by VJs Leah Miller and Matte Babel. She was asked about her career in stand-up comedy as well as her character work on "Stars Gone Wild". Dini noted her earliest influences as Mike Myers, Adam Sandler and Eddie Murphy.
Stand-up.
In February 2007, Dini was chosen as the opening act for veteran comedian Angelo Tsarouchas on the "It's All Greek To Me Tour" in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. The tour was spearheaded by Clayton Peters of Clayton Peters International Management. Clayton Peters is most widely known in the industry as manager and brother to Russell Peters.
Later that year Dini performed in Las Vegas at a local club. She then went to London, England, in July 2007 to perform at Jongleurs, a popular London Comedy chain. Dini was well received by international audiences and continued to earn attention on an international level thanks to her live performances and material on YouTube.
In the summer of 2007, she was the first comedian ever to perform live on the Toronto show "Bitch Salad". Bitch Salad is helmed by fellow Canadian comedian Andrew Johnston. He hosts a popular blog of the same name.
That same year, Dimakos performed on the annual "Accent on Toronto (6) - The Laughs Are On Us" alongside Jean Paul and Frank Spadone. "Accent on Toronto" is nationally aired on CBC Radio One, 99.1 FM.
Film.
In October 2007, Dimakos won the role of Grace on the short film "Speed Dating". Grace is a jilted, closeted lesbian who is secretly in love with her best girlfriend.
Later career.
, Dimakos' personal LinkedIn page shows that, following a career in entertainment from 1998 (as a fill-in radio host) to 2019, followed by schooling and training from 2019 to 2021, she is now Dini Dimakos Shevchenko, and is a Registered Social Service Worker (RSSW) with the Hills of Headwaters Collaborative Ontario Health Team, specifically part of the team located in Caledon, Ontario, providing support and caregiving to healthcare workers and their families throughout Dufferin County.
Press.
In November 2007 Dimakos was featured in the "Toronto Star" twice in the same day. An article by Michele Henry focused on Dini's life as a Toronto comedian including where she performs, shops and resides in the city. The second feature was a humorous quip by the young comedian on the commercialism of Toronto and was used to promote CBC Radio One's production of "Accent on Toronto 6 - The Laughs Are On Us".

Arbour was featured in Adweek magazine in April 2017 for her work in an advertisement of PMD's Lip Plumping Device.
Controversies.
"Dear Fat People" video.
In September 2015, Arbour became the subject of controversy when she posted a viral video on her YouTube channel titled "Dear Fat People". Critics argued that the video endorses fat shaming. The video was temporarily unavailable on YouTube, over claims that it violated the YouTube terms of service, but was later restored.
Arbour was the subject of both public and celebrity criticism, with plus-size model Ashley Graham labelling her comments as "disgusting".
Soon after the video was released, Canadian director Pat Mills stated publicly that he had considered hiring Arbour as a choreographer for his then-upcoming film "Don't Talk to Irene" after meeting with her, but that he then saw "Dear Fat People" and it "made me never want to see her again". This was reported as Arbour having been "fired" from the film, but in fact no job offer had been extended.
On September 16, 2015, Arbour appeared on "The View" to defend the "Dear Fat People" video, stating that "that video wasn't made to offend people...it's just satire," that she wasn't targeting those with medical conditions, and that the video wasn't supposed to be taken seriously. "Time" magazine stated, "Arbour doesn't see her comments as bullying, but rather an intense form of truth-telling". Arbour was quoted in the "Time" article saying:
I find seeing someone's head being blown off offensive ... I find children starving in a country with more than enough food offensive. I find women's bodies being mutilated for religious purposes, that is offensive to me. But words and satire I don't find offensive.
Arbour has put out other similarly named satirical videos, including "Dear Black People", "Dear Feminists", "Dear Sluts" and "Dear Refugees".
Political statements.
Arbour said she once identified with the Liberal Party of Canada, but in 2020 said she no longer did.
In a YouTube video in 2018 Arbour said that some people overreact when dealing with racial and gender issues, and that less focus should be spent on the institution of slavery which ended in the 19th century, and more focus should be spent on current issues stemming from it such as the racial wealth gap, marijuana legalization, police reform, and reforming the way media covers crime and arrests.

1073 Gellivara

1073 Gellivara, provisional designation , is a dark Themistian asteroid, approximately in diameter, located in the outer regions of the asteroid belt. It was discovered by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Vienna Observatory on 14 September 1923, and later named after the Swedish town of Gällivare.
Orbit and classification.
"Gellivara" is a Themistian asteroid that belongs to the Themis family (), a very large family of carbonaceous asteroids, named after 24 Themis. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.6–3.8 AU once every 5 years and 8 months (2,079 days; semi-major axis of 3.19 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Vienna on 1 October 1923, two weeks after its official discovery observation.
Naming.
This minor planet was named by Austrian astronomer Joseph Rheden with the consent of the discoverer's second wife, Anna Palisa, after the small Swedish town of Gällivare in Lapland, where astronomers witnessed the total eclipse of the Sun in 1927. "Gellivara" was the discoverer's last discovery. The official naming citation was mentioned in "The Names of the Minor Planets" by Paul Herget in 1955 ().
Physical characteristics.
"Gellivara" is an assumed carbonaceous C-type asteroid, which agrees with the overall spectral type of the Themis family.
Rotation period.
In November 2008, a rotational lightcurve of "Gellivara" was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Robert Stephens at the Goat Mountain Astronomical Research Station () in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 11.32 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.35 magnitude ().
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, "Gellivara" measures between 22.10 and 35.73 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.0241 and 0.07. The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" agrees with IRAS and derives an albedo of 0.0289 with a diameter of 35.76 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.7.

Song to Old Union

"Song to Old Union" is the alma mater of Union College in Schenectady, New York. It was written by Fitz Hugh Ludlow for Union's 1856 commencement ceremonies. It is sung each year at graduation, although it is the rare student or alumnus who knows more than the first verse and chorus.
The "brook that bounds," praised in the first verse, is Hans Groot's
Kill, a scenic stream that cuts through the secluded Jackson's Garden at
the north side of the campus.
Lyrics.
Ode to Old Union
"(AIR -- "Sparkling and Bright.")"
Let the Grecian dream of his sacred stream, 
And sing of the brave adorning, 
That Phoebus weaves from his laurel leaves 
At the golden gates of Morning; 
But the brook that bounds through Union's grounds 
Gleams bright as the Delphic water, 
And a prize as fair as a god may wear, 
Is a dip from our Alma Mater! 
CHORUS: 
Then here's to thee, the brave and free, 
Old Union smiling o'er us; 
And for many a day, as thy walls grow gray, 
May they ring with thy children's chorus. 
Could our praises throng on the waves of song, 
Like an Orient fleet gem-bringing, 
We would bear to thee the argosy, 
And crown thee with pearls of singing; 
But thy smile beams down beneath a crown 
Whose glory asks no other; 
We gather it not from the green sea-grot -- 
'Tis the love we bear our mother! 
CHORUS 
Let the joy that falls from thy dear old walls, 
Unchanged, brave Time's on-darting, 
And our only tear falls once a year 
On hands that clasp ere parting; 
And when other throngs shall sing thy songs, 
And their spell once hath bound us, 
Our faded hours shall revive their flowers, 
And the Past shall live around us.

1038 Tuckia

1038 Tuckia, provisional designation , is rare-type Hilda asteroid from the outermost regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 58 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 24 November 1924, by German astronomer by Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named after American banker Edward Tuck and his wife.
Classification and orbit.
"Tuckia" is a member of the Hilda family (), an asteroid family within the dynamical Hilda group, an orbital group of asteroids in the outermost main-belt, that stay in a 3:2 orbital resonance with the gas giant Jupiter. This means that the asteroid makes 3 orbits for every 2 orbits Jupiter makes.
It orbits the Sun at a distance of 3.1–4.9 AU once every 7 years and 11 months (2,902 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.22 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroids's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Heidelberg.
Physical characteristics.
In the Tholen classification, "Tuckia" is a rare DTU:-type, a subtype of the dark D-type asteroids.
Lightcurves.
In the 1990s, a rotational lightcurve of "Tuckia" was obtained from photometric observations by Swedish astronomer Dahlgren and colleges during a survey of Hildian asteroids. Lightcurve analysis gave a somewhat longer than average rotation period of 23.2 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.1 magnitude ().
Diameter and albedo.
According to the survey carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, "Tuckia" measures 52.69 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.030, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0304 and a diameter of 58.36 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.82.
Naming.
This minor planet was named after American banker and philanthropist Edward Tuck (1842–1938) and his wife. He is the son of Amos Tuck who was a founder of the Republican Party in the United States. The name was suggested by G. Camille Flammarion. The official naming citation was published by Paul Herget in "The Names of the Minor Planets" in 1955 ().

<doc id="7026278" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7026278" title="Homology modeling">
Homology modeling

Homology modeling, also known as comparative modeling of protein, refers to constructing an atomic-resolution model of the ""target" protein from its amino acid sequence and an experimental three-dimensional structure of a related homologous protein (the "template""). Homology modeling relies on the identification of one or more known protein structures likely to resemble the structure of the query sequence, and on the production of a sequence alignment that maps residues in the query sequence to residues in the template sequence. It has been seen that protein structures are more conserved than protein sequences amongst homologues, but sequences falling below a 20% sequence identity can have very different structure.
Evolutionarily related proteins have similar sequences and naturally occurring homologous proteins have similar protein structure.
It has been shown that three-dimensional protein structure is evolutionarily more conserved than would be expected on the basis of sequence conservation alone. 
The sequence alignment and template structure are then used to produce a structural model of the target. Because protein structures are more conserved than DNA sequences, and detectable levels of sequence similarity usually imply significant structural similarity.
The quality of the homology model is dependent on the quality of the sequence alignment and template structure. The approach can be complicated by the presence of alignment gaps (commonly called indels) that indicate a structural region present in the target but not in the template, and by structure gaps in the template that arise from poor resolution in the experimental procedure (usually X-ray crystallography) used to solve the structure. Model quality declines with decreasing sequence identity; a typical model has ~1–2 Å root mean square deviation between the matched Cα atoms at 70% sequence identity but only 2–4 Å agreement at 25% sequence identity. However, the errors are significantly higher in the loop regions, where the amino acid sequences of the target and template proteins may be completely different.
Regions of the model that were constructed without a template, usually by loop modeling, are generally much less accurate than the rest of the model. Errors in side chain packing and position also increase with decreasing identity, and variations in these packing configurations have been suggested as a major reason for poor model quality at low identity. Taken together, these various atomic-position errors are significant and impede the use of homology models for purposes that require atomic-resolution data, such as drug design and protein–protein interaction predictions; even the quaternary structure of a protein may be difficult to predict from homology models of its subunit(s). Nevertheless, homology models can be useful in reaching "qualitative" conclusions about the biochemistry of the query sequence, especially in formulating hypotheses about why certain residues are conserved, which may in turn lead to experiments to test those hypotheses. For example, the spatial arrangement of conserved residues may suggest whether a particular residue is conserved to stabilize the folding, to participate in binding some small molecule, or to foster association with another protein or nucleic acid.
Homology modeling can produce high-quality structural models when the target and template are closely related, which has inspired the formation of a structural genomics consortium dedicated to the production of representative experimental structures for all classes of protein folds. The chief inaccuracies in homology modeling, which worsen with lower sequence identity, derive from errors in the initial sequence alignment and from improper template selection. Like other methods of structure prediction, current practice in homology modeling is assessed in a biennial large-scale experiment known as the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction, or Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP).
Motive.
The method of homology modeling is based on the observation that protein tertiary structure is better conserved than amino acid sequence. Thus, even proteins that have diverged appreciably in sequence but still share detectable similarity will also share common structural properties, particularly the overall fold. Because it is difficult and time-consuming to obtain experimental structures from methods such as X-ray crystallography and protein NMR for every protein of interest, homology modeling can provide useful structural models for generating hypotheses about a protein's function and directing further experimental work.
There are exceptions to the general rule that proteins sharing significant sequence identity will share a fold. For example, a judiciously chosen set of mutations of less than 50% of a protein can cause the protein to adopt a completely different fold. However, such a massive structural rearrangement is unlikely to occur in evolution, especially since the protein is usually under the constraint that it must fold properly and carry out its function in the cell. Consequently, the roughly folded structure of a protein (its "topology") is conserved longer than its amino-acid sequence and much longer than the corresponding DNA sequence; in other words, two proteins may share a similar fold even if their evolutionary relationship is so distant that it cannot be discerned reliably. For comparison, the function of a protein is conserved much "less" than the protein sequence, since relatively few changes in amino-acid sequence are required to take on a related function.
Steps in model production.
The homology modeling procedure can be broken down into four sequential steps: template selection, target-template alignment, model construction, and model assessment. The first two steps are often essentially performed together, as the most common methods of identifying templates rely on the production of sequence alignments; however, these alignments may not be of sufficient quality because database search techniques prioritize speed over alignment quality. These processes can be performed iteratively to improve the quality of the final model, although quality assessments that are not dependent on the true target structure are still under development.
Optimizing the speed and accuracy of these steps for use in large-scale automated structure prediction is a key component of structural genomics initiatives, partly because the resulting volume of data will be too large to process manually and partly because the goal of structural genomics requires providing models of reasonable quality to researchers who are not themselves structure prediction experts.
Template selection and sequence alignment.
The critical first step in homology modeling is the identification of the best template structure, if indeed any are available. The simplest method of template identification relies on serial pairwise sequence alignments aided by database search techniques such as FASTA and BLAST. More sensitive methods based on multiple sequence alignment – of which PSI-BLAST is the most common example – iteratively update their position-specific scoring matrix to successively identify more distantly related homologs. This family of methods has been shown to produce a larger number of potential templates and to identify better templates for sequences that have only distant relationships to any solved structure. Protein threading, also known as fold recognition or 3D-1D alignment, can also be used as a search technique for identifying templates to be used in traditional homology modeling methods. Recent CASP experiments indicate that some protein threading methods such as RaptorX are more sensitive than purely sequence(profile)-based methods when only distantly-related templates are available for the proteins under prediction. When performing a BLAST search, a reliable first approach is to identify hits with a sufficiently low "E"-value, which are considered sufficiently close in evolution to make a reliable homology model. Other factors may tip the balance in marginal cases; for example, the template may have a function similar to that of the query sequence, or it may belong to a homologous operon. However, a template with a poor "E"-value should generally not be chosen, even if it is the only one available, since it may well have a wrong structure, leading to the production of a misguided model. A better approach is to submit the primary sequence to fold-recognition servers or, better still, consensus meta-servers which improve upon individual fold-recognition servers by identifying similarities (consensus) among independent predictions.
Often several candidate template structures are identified by these approaches. Although some methods can generate hybrid models with better accuracy from multiple templates, most methods rely on a single template. Therefore, choosing the best template from among the candidates is a key step, and can affect the final accuracy of the structure significantly. This choice is guided by several factors, such as the similarity of the query and template sequences, of their functions, and of the predicted query and observed template secondary structures. Perhaps most importantly, the "coverage" of the aligned regions: the fraction of the query sequence structure that can be predicted from the template, and the plausibility of the resulting model. Thus, sometimes several homology models are produced for a single query sequence, with the most likely candidate chosen only in the final step.
It is possible to use the sequence alignment generated by the database search technique as the basis for the subsequent model production; however, more sophisticated approaches have also been explored. One proposal generates an ensemble of stochastically defined pairwise alignments between the target sequence and a single identified template as a means of exploring "alignment space" in regions of sequence with low local similarity. "Profile-profile" alignments that first generate a sequence profile of the target and systematically compare it to the sequence profiles of solved structures; the coarse-graining inherent in the profile construction is thought to reduce noise introduced by sequence drift in nonessential regions of the sequence.
Model generation.
Given a template and an alignment, the information contained therein must be used to generate a three-dimensional structural model of the target, represented as a set of Cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein. Three major classes of model generation methods have been proposed.
Fragment assembly.
The original method of homology modeling relied on the assembly of a complete model from conserved structural fragments identified in closely related solved structures. For example, a modeling study of serine proteases in mammals identified a sharp distinction between "core" structural regions conserved in all experimental structures in the class, and variable regions typically located in the loops where the majority of the sequence differences were localized. Thus unsolved proteins could be modeled by first constructing the conserved core and then substituting variable regions from other proteins in the set of solved structures. Current implementations of this method differ mainly in the way they deal with regions that are not conserved or that lack a template. The variable regions are often constructed with the help of a protein fragment library.
Segment matching.
The segment-matching method divides the target into a series of short segments, each of which is matched to its own template fitted from the Protein Data Bank. Thus, sequence alignment is done over segments rather than over the entire protein. Selection of the template for each segment is based on sequence similarity, comparisons of alpha carbon coordinates, and predicted steric conflicts arising from the van der Waals radii of the divergent atoms between target and template.
Satisfaction of spatial restraints.
The most common current homology modeling method takes its inspiration from calculations required to construct a three-dimensional structure from data generated by NMR spectroscopy. One or more target-template alignments are used to construct a set of geometrical criteria that are then converted to probability density functions for each restraint. Restraints applied to the main protein internal coordinates – protein backbone distances and dihedral angles – serve as the basis for a global optimization procedure that originally used conjugate gradient energy minimization to iteratively refine the positions of all heavy atoms in the protein.
This method had been dramatically expanded to apply specifically to loop modeling, which can be extremely difficult due to the high flexibility of loops in proteins in aqueous solution. A more recent expansion applies the spatial-restraint model to electron density maps derived from cryoelectron microscopy studies, which provide low-resolution information that is not usually itself sufficient to generate atomic-resolution structural models. To address the problem of inaccuracies in initial target-template sequence alignment, an iterative procedure has also been introduced to refine the alignment on the basis of the initial structural fit. The most commonly used software in spatial restraint-based modeling is MODELLER and a database called ModBase has been established for reliable models generated with it.
Loop modeling.
Regions of the target sequence that are not aligned to a template are modeled by loop modeling; they are the most susceptible to major modeling errors and occur with higher frequency when the target and template have low sequence identity. The coordinates of unmatched sections determined by loop modeling programs are generally much less accurate than those obtained from simply copying the coordinates of a known structure, particularly if the loop is longer than 10 residues. The first two sidechain dihedral angles (χ1 and χ2) can usually be estimated within 30° for an accurate backbone structure; however, the later dihedral angles found in longer side chains such as lysine and arginine are notoriously difficult to predict. Moreover, small errors in χ1 (and, to a lesser extent, in χ2) can cause relatively large errors in the positions of the atoms at the terminus of side chain; such atoms often have a functional importance, particularly when located near the active site.
Model assessment.
A large number of methods have been developed for selecting a native-like structure from a set of models. Scoring functions have been based on both molecular mechanics energy functions (Lazaridis and Karplus 1999; Petrey and Honig 2000; Feig and Brooks 2002; Felts et al. 2002; Lee and Duan 2004), statistical potentials (Sippl 1995; Melo and Feytmans 1998; Samudrala and Moult 1998; Rojnuckarin and Subramaniam 1999; Lu and Skolnick 2001; Wallqvist et al. 2002; Zhou and Zhou 2002), residue environments (Luthy et al. 1992; Eisenberg et al. 1997; Park et al. 1997; Summa et al. 2005), local side-chain and backbone interactions (Fang and Shortle 2005), orientation-dependent properties (Buchete et al. 2004a,b; Hamelryck 2005), packing estimates (Berglund et al. 2004), solvation energy (Petrey and Honig 2000; McConkey et al. 2003; Wallner and Elofsson 2003; Berglund et al. 2004), hydrogen bonding (Kortemme et al. 2003), and geometric properties (Colovos and Yeates 1993; Kleywegt 2000; Lovell et al. 2003; Mihalek et al. 2003). A number of methods combine different potentials into a global score, usually using a linear combination of terms (Kortemme et al. 2003; Tosatto 2005), or with the help of machine learning techniques, such as neural networks (Wallner and Elofsson 2003) and support vector machines (SVM) (Eramian et al. 2006). Comparisons of different global model quality assessment programs can be found in recent papers by Pettitt et al. (2005), Tosatto (2005), and Eramian et al. (2006).
Less work has been reported on the local quality assessment of models. Local scores are important in the context of modeling because they can give an estimate of the reliability of different regions of a predicted structure. This information can be used in turn to determine which regions should be refined, which should be considered for modeling by multiple templates, and which should be predicted ab initio. Information on local model quality could also be used to reduce the combinatorial problem when considering alternative alignments; for example, by scoring different local models separately, fewer models would have to be built (assuming that the interactions between the separate regions are negligible or can be estimated separately).
One of the most widely used local scoring methods is Verify3D (Luthy et al. 1992; Eisenberg et al. 1997), which combines secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and polarity of residue environments. ProsaII (Sippl 1993), which is based on a combination of a pairwise statistical potential and a solvation term, is also applied extensively in model evaluation. Other methods include the Errat program (Colovos and Yeates 1993), which considers distributions of nonbonded atoms according to atom type and distance, and the energy strain method (Maiorov and Abagyan 1998), which uses differences from average residue energies in different environments to indicate which parts of a protein structure might be problematic. Melo and Feytmans (1998) use an atomic pairwise potential and a surface-based solvation potential (both knowledge-based) to evaluate protein structures. Apart from the energy strain method, which is a semiempirical approach based on the ECEPP3 force field (Nemethy et al. 1992), all of the local methods listed above are based on statistical potentials. A conceptually distinct approach is the ProQres method, which was very recently introduced by Wallner and Elofsson (2006). ProQres is based on a neural network that combines structural features to distinguish correct from incorrect regions. ProQres was shown to outperform earlier methodologies based on statistical approaches (Verify3D, ProsaII, and Errat). The data presented in Wallner and Elofsson's study suggests that their machine-learning approach based on structural features is indeed superior to statistics-based methods. However, the knowledge-based methods examined in their work, Verify3D (Luthy et al. 1992; Eisenberg et al. 1997), Prosa (Sippl 1993), and Errat (Colovos and Yeates 1993), are not based on newer statistical potentials.
Benchmarking.
Several large-scale benchmarking efforts have been made to assess the relative quality of various current homology modeling methods. Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) is a community-wide prediction experiment that runs every two years during the summer months and challenges prediction teams to submit structural models for a number of sequences whose structures have recently been solved experimentally but have not yet been published. Its partner Critical Assessment of Fully Automated Structure Prediction (CAFASP) has run in parallel with CASP but evaluates only models produced via fully automated servers. Continuously running experiments that do not have prediction 'seasons' focus mainly on benchmarking publicly available webservers. LiveBench and EVA run continuously to assess participating servers' performance in prediction of imminently released structures from the PDB. CASP and CAFASP serve mainly as evaluations of the state of the art in modeling, while the continuous assessments seek to evaluate the model quality that would be obtained by a non-expert user employing publicly available tools.
Accuracy.
The accuracy of the structures generated by homology modeling is highly dependent on the sequence identity between target and template. Above 50% sequence identity, models tend to be reliable, with only minor errors in side chain packing and rotameric state, and an overall RMSD between the modeled and the experimental structure falling around 1 Å. This error is comparable to the typical resolution of a structure solved by NMR. In the 30–50% identity range, errors can be more severe and are often located in loops. Below 30% identity, serious errors occur, sometimes resulting in the basic fold being mis-predicted. This low-identity region is often referred to as the "twilight zone" within which homology modeling is extremely difficult, and to which it is possibly less suited than fold recognition methods.
At high sequence identities, the primary source of error in homology modeling derives from the choice of the template or templates on which the model is based, while lower identities exhibit serious errors in sequence alignment that inhibit the production of high-quality models. It has been suggested that the major impediment to quality model production is inadequacies in sequence alignment, since "optimal" structural alignments between two proteins of known structure can be used as input to current modeling methods to produce quite accurate reproductions of the original experimental structure.
Attempts have been made to improve the accuracy of homology models built with existing methods by subjecting them to molecular dynamics simulation in an effort to improve their RMSD to the experimental structure. However, current force field parameterizations may not be sufficiently accurate for this task, since homology models used as starting structures for molecular dynamics tend to produce slightly worse structures. Slight improvements have been observed in cases where significant restraints were used during the simulation.
Sources of error.
The two most common and large-scale sources of error in homology modeling are poor template selection and inaccuracies in target-template sequence alignment. Controlling for these two factors by using a structural alignment, or a sequence alignment produced on the basis of comparing two solved structures, dramatically reduces the errors in final models; these "gold standard" alignments can be used as input to current modeling methods to produce quite accurate reproductions of the original experimental structure. Results from the most recent CASP experiment suggest that "consensus" methods collecting the results of multiple fold recognition and multiple alignment searches increase the likelihood of identifying the correct template; similarly, the use of multiple templates in the model-building step may be worse than the use of the single correct template but better than the use of a single suboptimal one. Alignment errors may be minimized by the use of a multiple alignment even if only one template is used, and by the iterative refinement of local regions of low similarity.
A lesser source of model errors are errors in the template structure. The PDBREPORT database lists several million, mostly very small but occasionally dramatic, errors in experimental (template) structures that have been deposited in the PDB.
Serious local errors can arise in homology models where an insertion or deletion mutation or a gap in a solved structure result in a region of target sequence for which there is no corresponding template. This problem can be minimized by the use of multiple templates, but the method is complicated by the templates' differing local structures around the gap and by the likelihood that a missing region in one experimental structure is also missing in other structures of the same protein family. Missing regions are most common in loops where high local flexibility increases the difficulty of resolving the region by structure-determination methods. Although some guidance is provided even with a single template by the positioning of the ends of the missing region, the longer the gap, the more difficult it is to model. Loops of up to about 9 residues can be modeled with moderate accuracy in some cases if the local alignment is correct. Larger regions are often modeled individually using ab initio structure prediction techniques, although this approach has met with only isolated success.
The rotameric states of side chains and their internal packing arrangement also present difficulties in homology modeling, even in targets for which the backbone structure is relatively easy to predict. This is partly due to the fact that many side chains in crystal structures are not in their "optimal" rotameric state as a result of energetic factors in the hydrophobic core and in the packing of the individual molecules in a protein crystal. One method of addressing this problem requires searching a rotameric library to identify locally low-energy combinations of packing states. It has been suggested that a major reason that homology modeling so difficult when target-template sequence identity lies below 30% is that such proteins have broadly similar folds but widely divergent side chain packing arrangements.
Utility.
Uses of the structural models include protein–protein interaction prediction, protein–protein docking, molecular docking, and functional annotation of genes identified in an organism's genome. Even low-accuracy homology models can be useful for these purposes, because their inaccuracies tend to be located in the loops on the protein surface, which are normally more variable even between closely related proteins. The functional regions of the protein, especially its active site, tend to be more highly conserved and thus more accurately modeled.
Homology models can also be used to identify subtle differences between related proteins that have not all been solved structurally. For example, the method was used to identify cation binding sites on the Na+/K+ ATPase and to propose hypotheses about different ATPases' binding affinity. Used in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations, homology models can also generate hypotheses about the kinetics and dynamics of a protein, as in studies of the ion selectivity of a potassium channel. Large-scale automated modeling of all identified protein-coding regions in a genome has been attempted for the yeast "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", resulting in nearly 1000 quality models for proteins whose structures had not yet been determined at the time of the study, and identifying novel relationships between 236 yeast proteins and other previously solved structures.

1069 Planckia

1069 Planckia, provisional designation , is a background asteroid from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 28 January 1927, by astronomer Max Wolf at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory in Germany. The asteroid was named after German physicist Max Planck.
Orbit and classification.
"Planckia" is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8–3.5 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (2,019 days; semi-major axis of 3.13 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 14° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg in February 1927, or 10 days after its official discovery observation.
Naming.
This minor planet was named after noted German physicist Max Planck (1858–1947), on the commemoration of his 80th birthday. He was a professor of physics at Berlin University and the founder of quantum mechanics. In 1918, he received the Nobel prize in Physics. The official naming citation was mentioned in "The Names of the Minor Planets" by Paul Herget in 1955 (). He is also honored by a lunar crater "Planck".
Physical characteristics.
In the SMASS classification, "Planckia" is a common, stony S-type asteroid.
Rotation period.
Between 2000 and 2010, several rotational lightcurves of "Planckia" were obtained from photometric observations by Brian Warner, Jérôme Caron and René Roy (). Lightcurve analysis gave a consolidated rotation period of 8.665 hours with a brightness amplitude between 0.14 and 0.42 magnitude.
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, "Planckia" measures between 35.657 and 44.34 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.1771 and 0.219.
The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" derives an albedo of 0.1982 and a diameter of 39.35 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.4.

1134 Kepler

1134 Kepler, provisional designation , is a stony asteroid and eccentric Mars-crosser from the asteroid belt, approximately 4 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 25 September 1929, by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. It is named after Johannes Kepler.
Orbit and classification.
"Kepler" orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.4–3.9 AU once every 4 years and 5 months (1,601 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.47 and an inclination of 15° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg, the night after its official discovery observation.
Physical characteristics.
In the SMASS taxonomy, "Kepler" is a stony S-type asteroid.
Diameter and albedo.
Its diameter has not been estimated by any of the prominent space-based surveys such as the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS (1982), the Japanese Akari satellite (2006), NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (2009) or its subsequent NEOWISE mission (2013). Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, "Kepler"s diameter is between 3 and 8 kilometer for an absolute magnitude of 14.2 and an assumed albedo in the range of 0.25 to 0.05. Since its spectral type falls into the class of stony asteroids, which have an averaged standard albedo around 0.20, "Kepler"s generic diameter is close to 4 kilometers, as the higher a body's albedo (reflectivity), the shorter its diameter at a fixed absolute magnitude (brightness).
"Kepler"s rotation period is 0.1148 day, a pretty common value for asteroids of this size.
Naming.
This minor planet was named on the commemoration of the 300th death anniversary of astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), best known for his laws of planetary motion. Kepler is also honored by a lunar and Martian crater, by "Kepler Dorsum" – a mountain ridge on the Martian moon Phobos, and by Kepler's Supernova.
Naming citation was first published in 1930, in the astronomy journal "Astronomical Notes" (AN 240, 135). The space observatory "Kepler" and its many discovered exoplanets also bear his name "(see also Kepler (disambiguation))".

1141 Bohmia

1141 Bohmia, provisional designation , is a Florian asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 6 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by German astronomer Max Wolf at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory on 4 January 1930. The asteroid was named after German philanthropist Katharina Bohm-Waltz.
Orbit and classification.
"Bohmia" is a member of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.9–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 5 months (1,249 days; semi-major axis 2.27 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Heidelberg in January 1930.
Physical characteristics.
"Bohmia"s spectral type is unknown. However, its albedo is similar to that of the Flora family's parent body, 8 Flora, which is a stony S-type asteroid.
Diameter and albedo.
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, "Bohmia" measures 5.642 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.251.
Rotation period.
No rotational lightcurve of "Bohmia" has been obtained from photometric observations. The asteroid's rotation period, poles and shape remain unknown.
Naming.
This minor planet was named after Katharina Bohm-Waltz (died 1901), a German philanthropist who donated a 0.72-meter reflecting telescope (named "Waltz reflector") to the discovering Heidelberg Observatory. The official naming citation was mentioned in "The Names of the Minor Planets" by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

Walk this way (humor)

"Walk this way" is a recurrent pun in a number of comedy films and television shows. It may be derived from an old vaudeville joke that refers to the double usage of the word "way" in English as both a "direction" and a "manner".
One version of this old joke goes like this: A heavy-set woman goes into a drug store and asks for talcum powder. The bowlegged clerk says, "Walk this way," and the woman answers, "If I could walk that way, I wouldn't need talcum powder!" In the 1970's "Monty Python's Flying Circus" episode "The Buzz Aldrin Show" [S02E04] a man enters a pharmacy asking for aftershave. When the chemist replies: "Certainly, sir, walk this way please," the man replies "If I could walk that way I wouldn't need aftershave."
As a popular visual gag, the joke perhaps first appeared on film in "Is My Palm Read" (1933), a Fleischer cartoon short in which Betty Boop complies with the instruction of Bimbo playing the palm reader. It is used in "After the Thin Man" (1936), with William Powell imitating the butler. Multiple generations were introduced to the gag by The Three Stooges, who used "Walk This Way" at least once but memorably in their 1951 film "Don't Throw the Knife." Playing census takers, Moe, Larry and Shemp follow a woman into her apartment and imitate her sexy walk. Mel Brooks included the routine in three major films, "The Producers", "Young Frankenstein" and "". According to Gene Wilder, who co-wrote the script of "Young Frankenstein" and played the title character, Brooks added the joke while shooting the scene, inspired by the old "talcum powder" routine. Marty Feldman, who played the hunchback Igor in "Young Frankenstein", later said: 
The Aerosmith song "Walk This Way" was inspired by the gag, although there are at least two stories of exactly which version inspired the band. In a 1984 interview, Steven Tyler credits the Three Stooges skit as being the impetus of the song. (Joe Perry has written that Aerosmith band members were devoted to watching The Three Stooges in the band's early days.) Another version cites the band's viewing of the film "Young Frankenstein" as inspiration.

Souvenir of Canada

Souvenir of Canada is a 2002 book written by Canadian author Douglas Coupland. A feature film based on the book was released theatrically in 2006.
In the book's introduction, Coupland states his intention was to author a book about Canada "that only Canadians would get." "Souvenir of Canada" is thus a book that is a bit about fairly obscure Canadian cultural matters, many of which reflect the author's own experiences growing up as a Canadian.
Arranged alphabetically with some artistic exceptions, the book is a collection of essays on uniquely Canadian experiences and objects, such as bilingualism, Anglophilia, beer bottles, cigarette warning labels, Kraft macaroni and cheese, and the Trans-Canada Highway. Each item is given a witty summary by Coupland, often drawing on personal anecdotes. Most also feature a unique photographic illustration, either through stock footage or an original photo by Coupland himself.
Though much of the book mocks Canadian nationalism and various national myths of Canada, Coupland states that he still considers himself patriotic. In analyzing various mundane items his intent is to show "another side" of Canadian culture that is less glamorous, but "still a part of who we are."
Titles.
The titles of the essays are, in order:
Souvenir of Canada 2.
In 2004 a sequel was released, Souvenir of Canada 2. It largely copied the format of the original, profiling new cultural artifacts. It also featured a photo essay on "Canada House," an abandoned pre-fabricated home in Vancouver that Coupland had decorated with sculptures and furniture made of items he considered to be quintessentially Canadian. Photographed by Martin Tessler.
The second book deviates from the format of the first book by featuring more photographs, fewer essays, and the large essay on Canada House. For instance, the Oka article is told without an essay, but as a footnote to two pictures.
Canada House.
Canada House was an art installation in Vancouver, British Columbia, that was built into a 1950s CMHC House. The house was gutted of items, and painted entirely white, including the fireplace, the roof, the floor, and all fixtures.
Coupland, also a trained sculptor, created many different art installations for the house, which embody Canadian experiences, memories and ideals. For instance, he built a sofa called the "Treaty Couch" which had a large seating area upholstered with red plaid, with a very small seat which was upholstered with the pattern of a cowichan sweater.
Canada House was constructed in November 2003, and took two weeks to set up. The installation was open for five days. The construction and the days the installation were open are featured in the film adaptation, Souvenir of Canada. The installation was then moved to Toronto for a brief exhibition before reaching its final destination in the Canadian Embassy in London, England.
Film adaptation.
The feature film adaptation of the book, also entitled "Souvenir of Canada", is a humorous and candid portrait of Coupland who is filmed while creating his art installation "Canada House". The film has a much larger biographical focus than the books, with interviews with both Coupland’s parents, family, and friends. The film also addresses the most revealing and touching biographical moments from the books, with actors playing the part of Coupland as a youth and his father as a youth.
The film was directed by Robin Neinstein and interweaves essays from the book visualized imaginatively through animation, dramatic scenes and old stock footage. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and US Comedy Arts Festival and was produced by Media Headquarters Film &amp; Television and the National Film Board of Canada. It is distributed by Maple Pictures.
Design.
The format of this book is derived from Coupland’s book, "City of Glass". The book’s design was mostly done by Jen Eby, with "City of Glass" as the model. His 2005 book "Terry", about Terry Fox, is also heavily derivative of the "City of Glass"/"Souvenir of Canada" format.

1169 Alwine

1169 Alwine, provisional designation , is a Florian asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 8 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 30 August 1930, by German and Italian astronomers Max Wolf and Mario Ferrero at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. Any reference of its name to a person is unknown.
Orbit and classification.
"Alwine" is a member of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 2.0–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,290 days; semi-major axis of 2.32 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, and no prior identifications were made, "Alwine"s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Heidelberg in August 1930.
Physical characteristics.
According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, "Alwine" measures 7.89 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo of 0.179. Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, its diameter is between 7 and 17 kilometers for an absolute magnitude of 12.8 and an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25.
Lightcurve.
As of 2017, no rotational lightcurves have been obtained. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.
Naming.
This minor planet is named after a common German female name. Any reference of this name to a person or occurrence is unknown.
Unknown meaning.
Among the many thousands of named minor planets, "Alwine" is one of 120 asteroids, for which no official naming citation has been published. All of these low-numbered asteroids have numbers between and and were discovered between 1876 and the 1930s, predominantly by astronomers Auguste Charlois, Johann Palisa, Max Wolf and Karl Reinmuth.

Agnes Bernelle

Agnes Bernelle (born Agnes Elisabeth Bernauer; 7 March 1923 – 15 February 1999) was a Berlin-born actress and singer, who lived in England for many years, then Ireland. She appeared in over 20 films and also made stage and television appearances.
Her family fled Berlin in 1936. She was the wartime "black propaganda" radio announcer codenamed "Vicky" for the British Political Warfare Executive.
Biography.
During the Second World War, she became involved with top secret British Special Operations radio broadcasts. Transmitting from Woburn Abbey alongside the top secret Enigma project, she was introduced to black propaganda. She was recruited for her native German language skills and was suggested by her father, Rudolf Bernauer, after he was sought out for his theatrical and German connections, operating under the codename "Vicky".
Her radio broadcasts on "Deutscher Kurzwellensender Atlantik" were bounced over to Germany and primarily were aimed at spreading confusion and lowering morale among German forces, along with being littered with code messages for resistance fighters on the continent disguised as record labels and numbers.
An oft-repeated story is that a broadcast by Bernelle caused a U-boat captain to surrender by informing him that his wife – whom he had not seen for two years – had given birth to twins.
Bernelle was Catholic. She converted to Catholicism in the mid-1930s along with her father, Bernauer, who was Hungarian and Jewish. Her German mother, Emmy (née Erb), was Protestant.
Family life.
Bernelle was married from 1945 to 1969 to Desmond Leslie (1921–2001). Leslie briefly became notorious for assaulting Bernard Levin during a live transmission of "That Was the Week That Was" in 1962 for writing a hostile review of one of his wife's performances. The show was "An Evening of Savagery and Delight" which had rave reviews at the Dublin Festival but lasted only three weeks at London's Duchess Theatre and polarised audiences. Bernelle bravely posted all the bad reviews along with the good outside the theatre.
The couple had three children.
Later years.
As an international cabaret singer she collaborated on record with artists such as Marc Almond, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, and The Radiators. She released three albums. The first, "Bernelle on Brecht and..." was produced by Philip Chevron of The Radiators and released in limited numbers by the Midnite Music Company in 1977. In 1985, she released "Father's Lying Dead on the Ironing Board", again produced by Chevron. This was followed in 1988 by Some Bizzare label produced album, "Mother, The Wardrobe is full of Infantrymen". The first two albums are filled with songs from Weimar cabaret (her father Rudolf Bernauer owned and ran three cabaret theatres in Berlin during the Weimar Republic years) and the third has more modern updates on the form with songs from Tom Waits and Roger McGough. She also sang a duet with Marc Almond on his "The Stars We Are" album, a song called "Kept Boy".
In 1978, Bernelle appeared Off Broadway in New York City in the American premiere of Bertolt Brecht's "Downfall of the Egotist Johann Fatzer", with Shelter West Theater Company at the Vam Dam Theatre, directed by W. Stuart McDowell, with an original musical score of ballads sung by Bernelle, composed by Tony Award-winning composer/arranger, Bruce Coughlin.
Last years.
She spent the later years of her life with her second partner, the historian and author Maurice Craig, in Sandymount, County Dublin. "The Fun Palace", her autobiography, was published in 1995.

1178 Irmela

1178 Irmela, provisional designation , is a stony asteroid from the middle regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 19 kilometers in diameter.
It was discovered on 13 March 1931, by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named after Irmela Ruska, wife of Ernst Ruska.
Orbit and classification.
"Irmela" orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.2–3.2 AU once every 4 years and 5 months (1,603 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic.
A first precovery was taken at Lowell Observatory in February 1931, extending the body's observation arc by 3 weeks prior to its official discovery observation at Heidelberg.
Physical characteristics.
Lightcurves.
In May 1984, a first rotational lightcurve of "Irmela" was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Richard Binzel. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 19.17 hours with a brightness variation of 0.34 magnitude ().
In March 2010, astronomer Robert Stephens obtained another lightcurve at the Center for Solar System Studies, that gave a divergent period of 11.989 hours with an amplitude of 0.40 magnitude ().
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, "Irmela" measures between 17.00 and 20.683 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.0503 and 0.105.
10μm radiometric data collected from Kitt Peak National Observatory in 1975, gave a diameter estimate of 19 kilometers.
The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" characterizes "Irmela" as a common S-type asteroid, derives an albedo of 0.0838 and calculates a diameter of 19.05 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 11.91.
Naming.
This minor planet was named after Irmela Ruska, wife of the inventor of the electron microscope and 1986 Nobelist, the German physicist Ernst Ruska (1906–1988), who shared the Nobel prize with Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer. The naming was granted by Max Wolf to his colleague August Kopff, himself a prolific discoverer of minor planets. The citation was published by Paul Herget in "The Names of the Minor Planets" ().

1179 Mally

1179 Mally, provisional designation , is an asteroid and long-lost minor planet from the central region of the asteroid belt, approximately 13 kilometers in diameter. Discovered by Max Wolf in 1931, the asteroid was lost until its rediscovery in 1986. The discoverer named it after his daughter-in-law, Mally Wolf.
Discovery and rediscovery.
"Mally" was discovered on 19 March 1931, by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany.
Soon after its initial discovery, it became one of few well known lost minor planets for over 55 years. In 1986, "Mally" was rediscovered by astronomers Lutz Schmadel, Richard Martin West and Hans-Emil Schuster, who remeasured the original discovery plates and computed alternative search ephemerides. This allowed them to find the body very near to its predicted position. In addition, historic photographic plates from the Palomar Sky Survey (1956–1958), the UK Schmidt Telescope (Australia), and the ESO Schmidt Telescope (Chile) confirmed the rediscovery.
Orbit and classification.
"Mally" orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.2–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,548 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Heidelberg in 1931.
Physical characteristics.
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, "Mally" measures between 11.20 and 16.60 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.059 and 0.097.
The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" assumes an albedo of 0.10 – a compromise value between the brighter stony (0.20) and darker carbonaceous asteroids (0.057) used for bodies with a semi-major axis between 2.6 and 2.7 AU – and calculates a diameter of 10.7 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.98.
Rotation period.
In September 2013, a rotational lightcurve of "Mally" was obtained from photometric observations taken at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. The fragmentary lightcurve gave a longer than average rotation period of 46.6 hours with a brightness variation of 0.08 magnitude. However, the obtained result is poorly rated by CALL ().
Naming.
This minor planet was named after Mally Wolf, wife of Franz Wolf and the discoverer's daughter-in-law. The official naming citation was published by Paul Herget in "The Names of the Minor Planets" in 1955 ().

1203 Nanna

1203 Nanna (provisional designation ) is a carbonaceous asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, about 35 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 5 October 1931, by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany, and named after Anna Risi, a model and mistress of painter Anselm Feuerbach.
Orbit.
Nanna is a dark C-type asteroid. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.2–3.6 AU once every 4 years and 11 months (1,797 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.25 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. In 1926, it was first identified as , extending the body's observation arc by 5 years prior to its official discovery observation.
Rotation period.
In September 2009, two rotational lightcurves of Nanna were obtained by American astronomer Brian Warner from photometric observations at his Palmer Divided Observatory in Colorado. The first lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 18.54 hours with a brightness variation of 0.12 magnitude (), while the second lightcurve was ambiguous giving a period of 25.80 and 12.90 hours, respectively, and an amplitude of 0.15 (). These results supersede a fragmentary lightcurve taken by French amateur astronomers Federico Manzini, Laurent Bernasconi and René Roy from August 2004, which gave a period of 15.6 hours ().
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Nanna measures between 31.80 and 37.91 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.028 and 0.056. The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" derives an albedo of 0.03 and a diameter of 35.06 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 11.7.
Naming.
This minor planet was named after Anna Risi, a model in several paintings by German classicist painter Anselm Feuerbach. The official naming citation was published by Paul Herget in "The Names of the Minor Planets" in 1955 ().

<doc id="7026390" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7026390" title="Joe Borden">
Joe Borden

Joseph Emley Borden, aka "Joe Josephs", (May 9, 1854 – October 14, 1929), nicknamed "Josephus the Phenomenal", was a starting pitcher in professional baseball for two seasons. Born in the Jacobstown section of North Hanover Township, New Jersey, he was playing for a Philadelphia amateur team when he was discovered by the Philadelphia White Stockings of the National Association (NA) in . The White Stockings needed a replacement for a recently released pitcher, and were awaiting the arrival of a replacement. During his short, seven-game stint with the team, he posted a 2–4 win–loss record, both victories recorded as shutouts. On July 28 of that season, he threw what is thought to be the first no-hitter in professional baseball history.
When the NA folded after the 1875 season, Borden signed a three-year contract with the Boston Red Caps. On April 22, 1876, Borden and the Red Caps were victorious in the first National League (NL) game ever played. Later that season, on May 23, he pitched a shutout, which some historians claim was the first no-hitter in Major League Baseball. Known for having an eccentric personality, he played under different surnames, such as Josephs and Nedrob, so as to disguise his involvement in baseball; his prominent family would have disapproved had they known. After he was released from the Red Caps as a player during the first season of his contract, he worked for a short period of time as their groundskeeper until he and the owner agreed to a buyout of the remainder of his contract. It was mistakenly claimed that he died in 1889, in the Johnstown Flood. His official death date is recognized as occurring in 1929 when he was 75 years of age.
Early life.
Joseph Emley Borden was born on May 9, 1854, in Jacobstown in North Hanover Township, New Jersey into a wealthy family. The fourth of John H. and Sarah Ann (Emley) Borden's six children, his father was a shoe manufacturer. Borden moved to Philadelphia in 1870. He joined the J.B. Doerr club by 1875, an amateur baseball club that played several teams around Philadelphia. It is claimed that his family would have been embarrassed that their son was playing baseball for money, and would have disapproved. To hide his playing career, he assumed several various last names, such as Josephs and Nedrob, which is Borden spelled backwards.
Career.
1875 season.
The Philadelphia White Stockings, of the NA, had recently dismissed pitcher Cherokee Fisher in July 1875 due to his clashing with team captain, Mike McGeary, and were in need of a replacement. The White Stockings signed George Zettlein, but there was a delay in his arrival. The team then signed Borden, who was a local Philadelphia amateur player, as a replacement until Zettlein arrived. His first appearance in a game for the White Stockings was on July 24, an 11–4 loss to Dick McBride and the Philadelphia Athletics.
In his next start, on July 28 against the Chicago White Stockings, he pitched the first recorded no-hitter in professional baseball history. Borden lost the next three games he started before defeating the St. Louis Brown Stockings, and future Hall of Fame pitcher Pud Galvin, 16–0 on August 9. By this time, Zettlein had settled in as their regular pitcher, and Borden was no longer needed. During his time with the White Stockings, he pitched in seven games, all of which he started and completed. He finished the season with a 2–4 win–loss record, two shutouts, a 1.50 earned run average in 66 innings pitched.
1876 season.
After the 1875 season concluded, the league, and subsequently the Philadelphia White Stockings, folded, allowing the NL to form, becoming the first "Major" league. Before the season, Borden signed a three-year contract worth $2000 a season ($ current dollar adjustment) with the Boston Red Caps of the NL. The club had high expectations that he could adequately replace Albert Spalding who had recently departed for the Chicago White Stockings. Sportswriters were in agreement with the club and dubbed him "Josephus the Phenomenal". Hall of Fame baseball writer Henry Chadwick described Borden's pitching style as having speed, but with little strategy. In addition to his swiftly moving fastball, he also delivered a curveball that moved down and away from right-handed batters; both pitches he delivered from a low arm angle. His Red Caps played the Philadelphia Athletics in the first game in NL history on April 22; the only game of the day due to rain cancelling the rest of the league's schedule. The Red Caps defeated the Athletics with two runs in the ninth inning, and a final score of 6–5 at Athletic Park, with Borden pitching the complete game for the victory.
On May 23, Borden pitched a two-hit 8–0 shutout victory against the Cincinnati Reds. Various historians claim that this performance was, instead, the first no-hitter thrown in the NL, thus the first in major league history. According to Lee Allen, baseball historian and writer, the scorecard shows that Borden gave up two bases on balls, which were counted as hits in the final score. The official scorekeeper for the game was O. P. Caylor, a writer for "The Cincinnati Enquirer", who believed, unlike his contemporaries, that bases on balls should be scored as hits. Bases on balls were only officially counted as hits for the season. "The Boston Daily Globe" reported on the game the following day, and noted that Reds had had two clean one-base hits during the game. Furthermore, on June 6, the "New York Clipper" did not report an occurrence of a no-hitter in their summary of the game, though the box score did have differing stats in other categories than what the "Daily Globe" had reported. Consequently, the first official no-hitter in Major League history was pitched by George Bradley, of the St. Louis Brown Stockings on July 15, 1876.
Two days after his near no-hitter, on May 25, Borden and the Red Caps faced the Reds again; this time against Cherokee Fisher, resulting in a scoreless game through nine innings. The Red Caps scored four runs in tenth inning for a 4–0 victory. Unfortunately for Borden, his pitching effectiveness declined rapidly after this, and at one point he reportedly lost his temper during a game in response to his own ineffectiveness, admonishing his teammates, even the well-liked and good-natured future Hall of famer George Wright. Due to his erratic pitching and behavior, he was released from the team by August. In 29 games pitched during the 1876 season, he started 24, completed 16, and recorded two shutouts. Additionally, he had an 11–12 win–loss record, a 2.89 earned run average in 218⅓ innings pitched, and led the league in allowing 51 bases on balls.
Post-baseball career.
Though the Red Caps had released him as a player, he was still under contract, so they had him work in various other capacities, such as a ticket-taker and groundskeeper. Eventually, team owner Nicholas Apollonio agreed to pay Borden approximately three-quarters of the two remaining years of his contract, and released him from the team. Borden reportedly found work stitching baseballs in Philadelphia. He later moved to West Chester, Pennsylvania and found work making shoes and boots. During the summer of 1883, he joined the semiprofessional Brandywine Base Ball Club, where he pitched and hit 1-for-11 in two victories.
It was mistakenly claimed that he died in May 1889 during the Johnstown Flood, the same disaster that had stranded the entire Louisville Colonels team. The Sporting Life magazine corrected the error in its June 19 issue, stating he was alive and living in Philadelphia. On February 7, 1891, Borden married Henrietta S. Evans, the daughter of publisher Henry S. Evans. The couple had two children, Richard, who died as a baby, and Lavinia. Borden worked as a banker with the Guarantee Trust and Safe Deposit Company and the Philadelphia representative for the U.S. Shipping Board. He was an amateur boxer and trained at Philadelphia Boxing Academy. He also kept hunting dogs and won exhibitions. Borden died in Yeadon, Pennsylvania at the age of 75, and is interred at Oaklands Cemetery in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

1214 Richilde

1214 Richilde, provisional designation , is a dark background asteroid from the central regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 35 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in 1932. Any reference of the asteroid's name to a person is unknown.
Discovery.
"Richilde" was discovered on 1 January 1932, by German astronomer Max Wolf at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory in southwest Germany. Five nights later, on 6 January 1932, it was independently discovered by Japanese astronomer K. Nakamura at Kwasan Observatory (), Kyoto. The Minor Planet Center only recognizes the first discoverer. The body's observation arc begins with its first observation as at Uccle Observatory in August 1930, approximately 16 months prior to its official discovery observation at Heidelberg.
Orbit and classification.
"Richilde" is a non-family asteroid from the main-belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.4–3.0 AU once every 4 years and 6 months (1,629 days; semi-major axis of 2.71 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 10° with respect to the ecliptic.
Physical characteristics.
In the SMASS, "Richilde" is a Xk-subtype, that transitions from the X-type to the rare K-type asteroids, while the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) characterizes the body as a primitive P-type asteroid.
Rotation period and pole.
In the 1990s, a rotational lightcurve of "Richilde" was first obtained from photometric observations by astronomers using the ESO 1-metre telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 9.860 hours with a brightness variation of 0.32 magnitude (). In October 2006, a concurring period of 9.870 hours and an amplitude of 0.31 was measured by French amateur astronomer Raymond Poncy ().
In 2011, a modeled lightcurve using data from the Uppsala Asteroid Photometric Catalogue (UAPC) and other sources gave a period 9.86687 hours, as well as a partial spin axis of (n.a.°, –59.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β).
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, "Richilde" measures between 30.70 and 39.58 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.044 and 0.07.
The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" derives an albedo of 0.0517 and a diameter of 35.22 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.10.
Naming.
This minor planet is named after a common German female name. Any reference of this name to a person or occurrence is unknown ().
Unknown meaning.
Among the many thousands of named minor planets, "Richilde" is one of 120 asteroids, for which no official naming citation has been published. All of these asteroids have low numbers between and and were discovered between 1876 and the 1930s, predominantly by astronomers Auguste Charlois, Johann Palisa, Max Wolf and Karl Reinmuth.

1219 Britta

1219 Britta, provisional designation , is a stony background asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 6 February 1932, by German astronomer Max Wolf at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory in southern Germany. The likely elongated S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 5.57 hours. Any reference of its name to a person is unknown.
Orbit and classification.
"Britta" is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. Based on osculating Keplerian orbital elements, the asteroid has also been classified as a member of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main-belt.
It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.9–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 3 months (1,203 days; semi-major axis of 2.21 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic.
The asteroid was first observed as at Heidelberg Observatory in September 1904. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Heidelberg in February 1932.
Naming.
This minor planet is named after a common German female name. Any reference of this name to a person or occurrence is unknown.
Unknown meaning.
Among the many thousands of named minor planets, "Britta" is one of 120 asteroids, for which no official naming citation has been published. All of these low-numbered asteroids have numbers between and and were discovered between 1876 and the 1930s, predominantly by astronomers Auguste Charlois, Johann Palisa, Max Wolf and Karl Reinmuth.
Physical characteristics.
"Britta" has been characterized as a stony S-type asteroid in both the Tholen- and SMASS-like taxonomy of the Small Solar System Objects Spectroscopic Survey (S3OS2).
Rotation period.
Several rotational lightcurves of "Britta" have been obtained from photometric observations since the 1980s. The consolidated lightcurve analysis results give a rotation period of 5.575 hours with a brightness amplitude between 0.48 and 0.75 magnitude, indicative of an elongated shape ().
Spin axis.
Modeled photometric data from the Lowell Photometric Database (LPD) and the robotic BlueEye600 Observatory, gave a concurring period of 5.57556 and 5.57557 hours, respectively. Both studies determined two spin axes of (72.0°, −66.0°) and (241.0°, −66.0°), as well as (61.0°, −2.0°) and (223.0°, −68.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β).
Diameter and albedo.
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, "Britta" measures between 9.860 and 11.76 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.223 and 0.346. The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" derives an albedo of 0.2629 and a diameter of 11.31 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.8.

Lunch of Blood

Lunch of Blood is Antonella Gambotto-Burke's first book and first anthology. The title was inspired by a Saul Bellow poem:
"Mice hide when hawks are high;&lt;br&gt;
Hawks shy from airplanes;&lt;br&gt;
Planes dread the ack-ack-ack;&lt;br&gt; Each one fears somebody.&lt;br&gt;
Only the heedless lions&lt;br&gt;
Under the Booloo tree&lt;br&gt;
Snooze in each other's arms&lt;br&gt;
After their lunch of blood -&lt;br&gt;
I call that living good!"
Published by Random House in 1994, "Lunch of Blood" was dedicated to the artist and critic John Henshaw, and includes Gambotto-Burke's 1991 "Independent on Sunday" cover story on British cardiothoracic surgeons ("Affairs of the Heart"), and interviews with Martin Amis, Edward de Bono, Gérard Depardieu, Alex Dimitriades, Ben Elton, Rachel Hunter, Elle Macpherson, Morrissey, Marc Newson, Noah Taylor, Naomi Wolf, and others. It peaked at number four on "The Sydney Morning Herald"'s bestseller lists and, according to a review section cover story in "The Weekend Australian", established Gambotto-Burke's reputation as the "Stilettoed Assassin".
Critical response.
"The Canberra Times" critic explained, "Geoffrey Wheatcroft called their tool of trade 'the killer interview'. Mark Lawson christened the movement 'jugular journalism'. It was like a bullfight, he said. 'Fifteen hundred words flash by, a succession of passes with the muleta, and then comes estocada, and another carcass is dragged away by the mule-team' ... [Gambotto is] one of our matador-interviewers." "Australian Bookseller &amp; Publisher" concurred:
"The interviews hang together superbly as a collection, largely because Gambotto has … the astonishing ability to reveal the absolute essence of a person." And in "The Sydney Morning Herald", Don Anderson described Gambotto-Burke in interviewer mode as "a Tinker Bell among the pirates, sprinkling fairy dust in the eyes of celebrity crocodiles ...," and concluded: "Never let it be said that Michael Douglas's line in "Wall Street", 'Lunch is for wimps', could apply to her."
Quotations.
Martin Amis: "Established authors often speak of the 'coldness' of novelists, a coldness purported to be necessary for the documenting process. Amis is not enthralled by the topic, narrows his pale eyes, lights another cigarette, and smokes it for a minute before speaking. 'You’re certainly not one removed from your emotions, but a fraction of a removal away. You do have this sort of vampiric attitude to experience.'"
Edward de Bono: "'I find everything beautiful, everything,’ he says. 'I am very much against the notion that for something to be beautiful, it has to be in a frame in an art gallery with someone reviewing it. Beauty may be the elegance of a mathematical solution, it can be a Penthouse centrefold, design, a rainy day ... anything.'"
Cardiothoracic surgeons: "Allen suddenly slices a straight line down the woman’s chest with his scalpel, through the plastic. A jewel-bright bar of blood bubbles up. the sticky plastic holds the skin in place. He begins burning the slight aperture with an electrosurgical generator - a bolt of energy which cauterizes bleeding vessels. His face is calm. The fumes rising from the flesh are thick and foul and curl into the faces of those watching. Burning flesh has the stench of burning rubber, burning hair."
Nick Cave: "'I’m not really interested in the audience’s enjoyment,’ Cave mumbles once he has changed into his clean trousers. 'It doesn't bother me one way or another. I just don't give a shit. People feel more and more disappointed with each concert because less and less happens. It's really easy to suck an audience in. like I can wiggle my bum and backflip on my head and they love it. I could make an audience love me until the end of my days. There's no point in it any more. I wish they’d just ... die.'"
Ben Elton: "'A single American stealth bomber costs five hundred million American dollars, and they are going to build one hundred and twenty of them. And then they turn around and complain about aid packages! Now that's the kind of obscenity we accept in our lives, and yet none of us can stand being in the lavatory and hearing the splash next door.'"
Rachel Hunter: "'There's this thing people say that the child won't know its mother if it has a nanny and that's rubbish! I know dogs and babies are different, and I had a Great Dane at home in Auckland, and I left her when she was quite young because I had to go back to England for months, and she knew who I was when I got back!'"
Elle Macpherson: "'However, men are men and women are women. That's all there is to it. women who want to be men and men who want to be women are not, to me, particularly normal. I am a woman. I get my periods every month. I get premenstrual tension. I have babies, I like to wear skirts, I like to have men open the door for me and stand up for me when I enter a room. I have absolutely noooo ambition to wear overalls and to have somebody talk to me about some girl that he fucked last night.'"
Morrissey: "'People tell me that they fall in love with me, but I sit at home, night after night, watching television documentaries, and I ask myself: Where are all these people who are falling in love with me? And, you know, I'm stroking the cat ... I'm buttering a large piece of brown toast ... I'm asking myself whether or not I really have anything at all to do with youth culture ... it's very curious.'"

Maestre de campo

Maestre de campo was a rank created in 1534 by the Emperor Charles I of Spain, inferior in rank only to the "capitán general" and acted as a chief of staff. He was chosen by the monarch in the Council of State, and commanded a "tercio". Their powers were similar to those of the old marshals of the Kingdom of Castile: they had the power to administer justice and to regulate the food supply. Their personal guard consisted of eight German halberdiers, paid by the king, who accompanied them everywhere. Immediately inferior in the chain of command was the "sargento mayor". One of the most famous "maestre de campos" was Julian Romero, a common soldier who reached that rank and that brought victory to the Spanish "tercios" at the battles of San Quintín and Gravelines.
In the overseas colonies of the Spanish Empire a governor held the rank of "capitán general" over his local forces and would appoint his "maestre de campo".

Edmond Hall

Edmond Hall (May 15, 1901 – February 11, 1967) was an American jazz clarinetist and bandleader. Over his career, Hall worked extensively with many leading performers as both a sideman and bandleader and is possibly best known for the 1941 chamber jazz song "Profoundly Blue".
Biography.
Early life.
Born in Reserve, Louisiana, United States, about 40 miles west of New Orleans on the Mississippi River, Hall and his siblings were born into a musical family. His father, Edward Blainey Hall, and mother, Caroline Duhe, had eight children, Priscilla (1893), Moretta (1895), Viola (1897), Robert (1899), Edmond (1901), Clarence (1903), Edward (1905) and Herbert (1907).
His father, Edward, played the clarinet in the Onward Brass Band, joined by Edmond's maternal uncles, Jules Duhe on trombone, Lawrence Duhe on clarinet, and Edmond Duhe on guitar. The Hall brothers, Robert, Edmond, and Herbert, all became clarinetists, but Edmond was first taught guitar by his uncle Edmond. When Hall picked up the clarinet, "he could play it within a week. He started Monday and played it Saturday," his brother Herb recalled in an interview with Manfred Selchow, who wrote a biography of Hall titled "Profoundly Blue" (1988).
Hall worked as a farmhand, but by 1919 he had become tired of the hard work, and despite his parents' worries of him finding a decent job as a musician, he left for New Orleans. The first New Orleans band he played with was that of Bud Rousell (Bud Russell). He also played with Jack Carey (trombone) and blues cornetist Chris Kelley.
Music career.
In 1920, he went to a dance at Economy Hall in New Orleans where Buddy Petit was playing. Petit needed a replacement on clarinet, and he hired Hall. After two years, he moved to Pensacola, Florida, and joined Lee Collins's band, followed by Mack Thomas, and the Pensacola Jazzers. He met trumpeter Cootie Williams and, with Williams, he joined the Alonzo Ross DeLuxe Syncopators.
Hall moved to New York City in 1928, and was a member of the Claude Hopkins orchestra until 1935. Hall had been featured on alto and baritone saxophone since 1922. When he joined Billy Hicks's band, the Sizzling Six, he had a position as a full-time clarinetist. On June 15, 1937, he had his first recording session with Billie Holiday, accompanied by Lester Young on tenor saxophone. 
In 1940, Henry "Red" Allen arrived at the Café Society, and Hall became the band's clarinetist. Hall spent nine years at the Café Society, playing and recording in between jobs with many of his contemporaries, such as Sid Catlett, Charlie Christian, Ida Cox, Wild Bill Davison, Sidney De Paris, Vic Dickenson, Roy Eldridge, Bud Freeman, Coleman Hawkins, Eddie Heywood, J. C. Higginbotham, Meade Lux Lewis, Lucky Millinder, Hot Lips Page, Zutty Singleton, Joe Sullivan, Art Tatum, Jack Teagarden, Big Joe Turner, Helen Ward, and Josh White. He recorded for the first time as a leader in February 1941.
Late in 1941, Hall left Allen to join Teddy Wilson, who also played at the Café Society. Around this time Hall's style changed. His admiration for Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw caused him to work on his technique. Hall tried a Boehm system clarinet, but that attempt was short-lived. He soon went back to his beloved Albert System clarinet, which he played until he died.
During this period, he made many recordings as Edmond Hall's Blue Note Jazzmen, the Edmond Hall Sextet, the Edmond Hall Celeste Quartet, Edmond Hall's Star Quintet, Ed Hall and the Big City Jazzmen, and Edmond Hall's Swingtet. The recording sessions always took place between the work hours of the Café Society and included many of the musicians who performed there. Hall was frequently invited to the Town Hall concerts led by Eddie Condon.
In 1944, Teddy Wilson formed a trio, while the other band members remained at Café Society. Hall became a bandleader after being asked by Barney Josephson, owner of Café Society. He recorded for Blue Note and Commodore. In an "Esquire" magazine poll, he was voted the second-best clarinet player, behind the clarinetist he admired most, Benny Goodman.
With Louis Armstrong.
In the mid-1940s, Barney Josephson sought new musicians to play Café Society. In June 1947, Hall left the club. Early in 1947 Louis Armstrong's appearance at Carnegie Hall was announced. Hall and his small combo were picked to accompany Armstrong during half of the program. As a result of this concert, Armstrong would abandon his big band and switch a small combo, the All Stars.
In September 1947, Hall joined the All-Star Stompers with Wild Bill Davison, Ralph Sutton and Baby Dodds. Meanwhile, Barney Josephson again asked Hall to return to Uptown Café Society with a new band. Business worsened, however, and Josephson closed Uptown in December 1947. Hall took his men back to Downtown Café Society but, in June 1948, Hall's band was replaced with the Dave Martin Trio.
In late 1948, Hall took a job at Boston's Savoy Cafe, playing with members of Bob Wilber's band. He also promoted a concert with George Wein. Steve Connolly of the Savoy Cafe asked Hall to bring his own band and replace Bob Wilber. Hall's band, the Edmond Hall All-Stars, began playing the Savoy on April 4, 1949.
Hall left the Savoy in early March 1950 to return to New York. He played clubs and festivals, including one job in San Francisco. Eddie Condon called Hall in San Francisco, asking him to join his band at Eddie Condon's. Hall stayed with Condon, playing other jobs as well, mostly with members from Condon's band. An example was the Annual Steamboat Ball in June 1951 and the frequent sessions for the Dr. Jazz broadcasts during 1952. Condon's band recorded many sessions during Hall's engagement.
In November 1952, Hall participated in a special concert, "Hot Versus Cool," which pitted New Orleans-style jazz against bop. The New Orleans-style musicians were Hall, Dick Cary, Vic Dickenson, Jack Lesberg, Jimmy McPartland, and George Wettling. On the opposite side were Ray Abrams, Don Elliott, Dizzy Gillespie, Al McKibbon, and Max Roach. The album received a top rating of five stars in "DownBeat" magazine. During 1954, Hall played with Ralph Sutton, Mel Powell, and Jack Teagarden.
At the end of 1955, Hall left Condon to appear as a guest musician on the Teddy Wilson show. He then replaced Barney Bigard in the Louis Armstrong band, which toured Europe and Sweden. Felix Blair of "The New York Times" wrote, "America's secret weapon is a blue note in a minor key. Right now its most effective ambassador is Louis Satchmo Armstrong." The quotation was used for the album "Ambassador Satch".
The band moved to Los Angeles to participate in the filming of "High Society" (1956) starring Grace Kelly and Bing Crosby. After tours in Australia and England, the band visited Ghana, Africa, where it played for its largest audience, 11,000 at the first concert. Back in the U.S., there was a performance with the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein. The evening's grand finale was Bernstein conducting the stadium symphony orchestra in an Alfredo Antonini arrangement of "Saint Louis Blues". The event was held at Lewisohn Stadium in New York, which drew a crowd of 21,000 people. The event was filmed as part of the documentary "Satchmo the Great", produced and narrated by Edward R. Murrow, with film clips of the tours in Europe and Ghana.
The All Stars appeared on "The Ed Sullivan Show" before leaving for the midwest to play the Ravinia Festival near Chicago. They participated in a Norman Granz Benefit at Hollywood Bowl. In December 1956, they recorded the album "Satchmo – A Musical Autobiography" and supported it with a tour in the U.S. and South America. Hall became an honorary member of the Hot Club De Buenos Aires.
Tired of touring, Hall left the All-Stars and took a vacation in California. After his vacation, he performed with old friends Eddie Condon, Ralph Sutton, Teddy Wilson, Red Allen, and J. C. Higginbotham. Hall was invited to play with bands in Toronto, then returned to Chicago for an engagement at the Jazz, Ltd. club. At the end of 1958, he entered the studio to record "Petit Fleur" with his sextet, including friends from Cafe Society such as Vic Dickenson.
Hall returned to Ghana, having been impressed with its beauty, friendliness, and lack of racial prejudice. His goal was to settle there and start a music school. Hall and Winnie left New York for an exploratory trip, and when they returned they had decided to move to Ghana. Before moving, Hall was invited to the South Shore Jazz Festival in Milton, Massachusetts. He recorded "Rumpus on Rampart Street" with his orchestra, then left for Ghana. But his attempt at a music school failed. He was unable to get students to practice, and their lack of discipline and interest motivated his return to the U.S.
Hall flew to Copenhagen in 1961 to perform as a guest with Papa Bue's Viking Jazz Band. Returning home, he assembled the Hall American Jazz Stars and played at Condon's in New York City. During the early 1960s, he worked often, touring with Yves Montand and Chris Barber, and recording with Leonard Gaskin, Marlowe Morris, and the Dukes of Dixieland. In 1964, Hall and his wife settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Last years.
George Wein assembled a package of bands, and Hall was the featured star with the Dukes of Dixieland, who toured Japan in July 1964. He played at the Carnegie Hall Salute to Eddie Condon and appeared at jazz festivals, often with his friend Vic Dickenson.
For a few months, he played regularly at the Monticello restaurant, often in front of little or no audience as jazz was less popular. Hall would have played for as little as $50, but his wife did not let him unless the offer was at least $70–$75. By then Hall was semi-retired and would show up unexpectedly at a nearby pub where the local band, Tomasso and His Jewels of Dixieland, would play. According to Tomasso, they never knew when Hall would show up. Hall did that for an about six months for free, without any contract, for the pleasure of playing.
A break came in November 1966, when plans for a European tour were made. Hall was to play with Alan Elsdon's band during the tour, which began in England and extended to Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. Hall returned to Denmark to record for Storyville at the Rosenberg Studio in Copenhangen. 
Hall was back home for Christmas. In January 1967, there was another important engagement, John Hammond's 30th Anniversary Concert – Spirituals to Swing at Carnegie Hall in New York. Hall was invited as he belonged the Café Society Band, which was featured at the concert. The next important concert was the Second Annual "Boston Globe" Jazz Festival on January 21, 1967. On February 3, 1967, Hall played at the Governor Dummer Academy with George Poor's band as a featured performer with Bobby Hackett. This was his last recording (JCD-233).
Hall died on February 12, 1967, at the age of 65.
Private life.
In April 1922, while playing in Buddy Petit's Band, Hall married 17-year-old girl Octavia Stewart. The marriage was prompted by the imminent arrival of their son, Elton Edmond Hall, who was born on July 20, 1922, but died as a child on December 3, 1934.
On May 12, 1938, he married his second wife, Winnifred Henry from Cambridge Massachusetts. He met her while he was a member of the Hopkins Band three years earlier at Ruggles Hall in Boston. The couple had no children. Hall was constantly practicing his clarinet even on his days off. Winnie sometimes was part of his travels. They had friends in England whom they visited frequently.
Throughout his career into the mid-1950s, Hall was confronted with race discrimination. In 1951, while playing at Condon's a film crew came in and wanted Hall to play the background track, but he was replaced with Pee Wee Russell for the actual shooting. Hall refused and called his union. Condon and the other musicians supported him. Losing a large audience in the south, if displaying a black man in the band was the company's reasoning. They did make two versions but in the end, the version with Hall was the only one released. Hall also recalled being talked to by police frequently, about the way he had parked his car, while others in the group were not bothered. On one occasion he and his wife were refused a hotel room and were forced to spend the night in their car.
In 1952, Hall, Buzzy Drootin and Ralph Sutton appeared as the Ralph Sutton Trio in Saint Louis, where they played the "Encore Lounge" for several weeks. They were the first mixed trio there.

Panzanella

Panzanella () or panmolle () is a Tuscan and Umbrian chopped salad of soaked stale bread, onions and tomatoes that is popular in the summer. It often includes cucumbers, sometimes basil and is dressed with olive oil and vinegar.
It is also popular in other parts of central Italy.
History.
The 16th-century artist and poet Bronzino sings the praises of onions with oil and vinegar served with toast and, a page later, speaks of a salad of onions, purslane, and cucumbers. This is often interpreted as a description of "panzanella".
The name is believed to be a portmanteau of "pane", Italian for 'bread', and "zanella", a deep plate in which it is served.
Ingredients.
"Panzanella" was based on onions, not tomatoes, until the 20th century.
Modern "panzanella" is generally made of stale bread soaked in water and squeezed dry, red onions, tomatoes, olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Cucumbers and basil are often added.
Optional ingredients include lettuce, olives, mozzarella, white wine, capers, anchovies, celery, carrots, red wine, tuna, parsley, boiled egg, Mentha mint, bell peppers, lemon juice, and garlic. These ingredients are sometimes used, but Florentine traditionalists disapprove.

Dostyk

 
Dostyk (, "Dostyq") or Druzhba () is a small town in Kazakhstan's Jetisu Region, on the border with Xinjiang, China. It is a port of entry (by highway and railroad) from China. The rail portion serves as an important link in the Eurasian Land Bridge. It is situated in the Dzungarian Gate, a historically significant mountain pass.
Railways.
The agreement between the Soviet Union and the PRC to connect Kazakhstan with Western China by rail was achieved in 1954. On the Soviet side, the railway reached the border town of Druzhba (Dostyk) (whose names, both Russian and Kazakh, mean 'friendship' in each respective language) in 1959. On the Chinese side, however, the westward construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway was stopped once it reached Urumqi in 1962. Due to the Sino-Soviet Split, the border town remained a sleepy backwater for some 30 years, until the railway link was finally completed on September 12, 1990.
The port of entry on the Chinese side is Alashankou.
There is a bogie exchange depot to facilitate the through movement of freight and passengers railcars.
Uniform gauge.
The railway networks of the two countries use different gauges (China, like most of Europe, uses the standard gauge of , but Kazakhstan uses the broader gauge of ), so there are breaks of gauge. It is proposed to build a standard gauge Trans–Asian railway link between Europe and China to bypass these two breaks of gauge. This project was signed in 2004.
The other end of this proposed uniform gauge line is at Gorgan in Iran.

AIA Central

The AIA Central (), formerly called AIG Tower (), in Hong Kong is a 185-metre (607 ft.), 37-storey skyscraper that was completed in 2005 and serves as the headquarters of AIA Group. It is located in Central, not far from the landmark Bank of China Tower.
The Furama Kempinski Hotel, famous for its revolving restaurant, formerly stood on the same lot that the former AIG Tower rises from, but in December 2001, the 33-storey hotel was demolished to make way for the AIG Tower. The tower was renamed to AIA Central on 9 July 2009.
The building was jointly developed by Lai Sun Development, CapitaLand, and American International Group (AIG). The architectural firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill designed the building to look like the Chinese junk, a Chinese sailboat design dating from ancient times and still in use today. Leslie E. Robertson Associates are the structural engineers for this project. As well they included a pedestrian bridge linking the tower to the Hong Kong elevated walkway network.
The building has approximately 41,777 m² (450,000 ft²) of office accommodation.
Plot history.
The 999-year leasehold site has an area of .
Lai Sun Development ("LSD"), founded by textiles magnate Lim Por-yen, paid HK$7 billion for Furama Hotel Enterprises in June 1997. Lai Sun, which already owned the Ritz-Carlton Hotel next door, acquired a 45.42 per cent stake for $3.13 billion, and made a general offer at $33.50 for each remaining shares at a total cost of $6.893 billion.
LSD intended to combine the two plots into a prime office block. Then the Asian financial crisis struck, plunging the entire group into distress and forced asset sales. In March 2000, LSD announced that a 65% stake in the Furama Hotel would be sold to a 50:50 joint venture between Pidemco and AIG for HK$1.88 billion. Pidemco, the largest owner of commercial properties in Singapore, is part of Singapore Technologies, controlled by Temasek Holdings. As part of the deal, Lai Sun would continue to operate the hotel until its redevelopment. The Furama Hotel closed in November, and was demolished in December 2001. Following the demolition of the Furama Hotel, the construction of the new tower AIA Central commenced in November 2002. AIA Central is a 37-storey grade A office building with a gross floor area of approximately 41,777 square metres. It provides 26 floors of prime office space, each of some 13,000 – 15,000 square foot lettable area with a total gross area of 450,000 square foot. The building was developed by Bayshore Development Group Limited, a joint venture of AIA and Lai Sun Development Company Limited.

Richard Hind Cambage

Richard Hind Cambage (7 November 1859 – 28 November 1928) was an Australian surveyor and botanist who made important contributions to the description of the genera "Acacia" and "Eucalyptus".
Early life.
Cambage, son of John Fisher Cambage, was born at Applegarth near Milton, New South Wales. He was educated at state and private schools (including Ulladulla Public School), and for a short time was a teacher at the Milton State School. In 1878 he became an assistant to M. J. Callaghan, surveyor, and took part in the survey of National Park in 1879 and 1880. On 11 July 1881 at the Elizabeth Street registry office, Sydney, he married Fanny Skillman (d.1897), daughter of the headteacher at Ulladulla.
Surveying career.
He qualified as a licensed surveyor in June 1882, was engaged in the Department of Lands for three years as a draftsman and then entered the department of mines as a mining surveyor on 16 February 1885. In 1900 he carried out a difficult and dangerous survey of abandoned Newcastle workings running under the harbour and sea-bed. In 1902 was appointed chief mining surveyor and investigated the site of the Mount Kembla mining disaster which killed 96 men and boys. Cambage's evidence to the royal commission on the disaster led to the reversal of the coroner's verdict that the miners had died of carbon monoxide poisoning. He was chief mining surveyor until 1 January 1916, when he was made under-secretary of the mines department. He retired from the public service on 7 November 1924.
Although a busy public servant he contrived to carry on a large amount of other work and cultivated many interests. Front 1909 to 1915 he lectured on surveying at Sydney Technical College, was on three occasions elected president of the Institution of Surveyors, and was for 15 years a member of its board of examiners.
Botany career.
He had early become much interested in geology and botany, and between 1901 and 1903 contributed to the Linnean Society a series of "Notes on the Botany of the Interior of New South Wales" of which as "Notes on the Native Flora of New South Wales", a further long series was published over a period of more than 20 years. He was secretary of the Royal Society of New South Wales from 1914 to 1922 and from 1925 to 1928 and was president in 1912 and 1923.
He was a member of the council of the Linnean Society of New South Wales from 1906 and was its president in 1924. He was honorary secretary of the Australian National Research Council from its inception in 1919 until 1926, and organised the second pan-Pacific science congress held in Melbourne and Sydney in 1923. He was its president from 1926 to 1928 and he was elected president of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science In 1928. He was also president of the New South Wales forest league and did much work for the Australian wattle league. In spite of the time spent on administrative work Cambage was able to make valuable contributions to science. For many years he systematically planted seeds of "Acacia", and at the time of his death had contributed 13 papers to the Journal of the Royal Society with descriptions of 130 species, and he also did some papers on the eucalypts. As a member of the Royal Australian Historical Society his knowledge of surveying and bushcraft enabled him to throw light on the journeys of some of the early explorers. A paper on Exploration Beyond the Upper Nepean in 1798, was published separately as a pamphlet in 1920. He died suddenly on 28 November 1928.
"Acacia cambagei" and "Eucalyptus cambageana" were named after him.

Dio, come ti amo

 is a song recorded by both Italian singers Domenico Modugno and Gigliola Cinquetti, composed and written by Modugno himself. The song won the Sanremo Music Festival 1966 and performed by Modugnoin the Eurovision Song Contest 1966, held in Luxembourg.
Background.
Conception.
The song was composed by Domenico Modugno. It is a ballad, in which the singer tells his/her lover how he feels about her/him. The singer expresses his/her amazement at the depth of his/her own feelings, with the title phrase being used frequently.
Sanremo.
On 27–29 January 1966, "Dio, come ti amo" competed in the 16th edition of the Sanremo Music Festival performed by both Modugno and Gigliola Cinquetti, and winning the competition. As the festival was used by Radiotelevisione italiana (RAI) to select its song and performer for the of the Eurovision Song Contest, the song became the for the contest. An experts jury appointed Modugno as the performer for Eurovision.
Modugno released then the song also in English (as "Oh, how much I love you"), German (as "), and in two Spanish versions (" and "").
Eurovision.
On 5 March 1966, the Eurovision Song Contest was held at Villa Louvigny in Luxembourg hosted by the (CLT), and broadcast live throughout the continent. Modugno performed " fourteenth on the evening, following 's " by Téréza and preceding 's "" by Dominique Walter.
The song had been rearranged since its performance at Sanremo. During rehearsals, mere hours before the live contest, Modugno performed the new arrangement with three of his own musicians as opposed to the orchestra, which went over the three minute time limit. This broke the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) rules stating that the arrangement should be communicated well in advance and should not be over three minutes. Following his rehearsal, Modugno was confronted by the show's producers about exceeding the time limit and was asked to use the original arrangement with the orchestra. Modugno was so dissatisfied with the orchestra that he threatened to withdraw from the contest. Both the producers and EBU scrutineer Clifford Brown felt it was too short notice to fly Cinquetti to Luxembourg to perform the song, so the EBU gave in and allowed Modugno to use his own ensemble instead of the orchestra. Despite news reports and the official programme listing as the conductor, Giacomazzi actually played the piano for the entry.
At the close of voting, the song had received "nul points" (zero), for the first and also the only time in Italian Eurovision history, placing seventeenth (equal last) in a field of eighteen. It was succeeded as Italian representative at the by " by Claudio Villa.
Aftermath.
Cinquetti starred in a film titled " released in 1966, accompanied by Mark Damon, Raimondo Vianello, and Nino Taranto.

Plutonium in the environment

Since the mid-20th century, plutonium in the environment has been primarily produced by human activity. The first plants to produce plutonium for use in Cold War atomic bombs were the Hanford nuclear site in Washington, and the Mayak nuclear plant, in Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia. Over a period of four decades, "both released more than 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment – twice the amount expelled in the Chernobyl disaster in each instance."
The majority of plutonium isotopes are not short-lived on a geological timescale, though it has been argued that traces of the long-lived 244Pu isotope still exist in nature. This isotope has been found in lunar soil, meteorites, and in the Oklo natural reactor. However, one study on plutonium in marine sediments indicates that the atomic bomb fallout accounts for 66% of the 239Pu and 59% 240Pu in the English Channel. In contrast, nuclear reprocessing contributes the majority of the 238Pu and 241Pu in the Earth's oceans, whereas nuclear weapons testing is responsible for only 6.5% and 16.5% of these isotopes, respectively.
Sources of plutonium.
Plutonium production.
Richland, Washington was the first city established to support plutonium production at the nearby Hanford nuclear site, to power the American nuclear weapons arsenals. Ozersk, Russia supported plutonium production to power the Soviet nuclear arsenals at the Mayak nuclear plant. These were the first two cities in the world to produce plutonium for use in cold war atomic bombs.
In the 2013 book, "Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters", Kate Brown explores the health of affected citizens in both the United States and Russia, and the "slow-motion disasters" that still threaten the environments where the plants are located. According to Brown, the plants at Hanford and Mayak released over 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment over four decades, which is twice the amount expelled in the Chernobyl disaster in each instance.
Most of the radioactive contamination over the years from Hanford and Mayak were part of normal operations. Unforeseen accidents did occur, but plant management kept this secret, and the pollution continued unabated. Even today, as pollution threats to health and the environment persist, the government conceals information about the associated risks from the public.
Bomb detonations.
About 3.5 tons of plutonium have been released into the environment by atomic bomb tests. While this might sound significant, it has only resulted in a very small dose to the majority of the humans on Earth. Overall the health effects of fission products are far greater than the effects of the actinides released by a nuclear bomb detonation. The plutonium from the fuel of the bomb is converted into a high-fired oxide that is carried high into the air. It slowly falls to earth as global fallout and is not soluble, and as a result it is difficult for this plutonium to be incorporated into an organism if ingested. Much of this plutonium is absorbed into sediments of lakes, rivers and oceans. However, about 66% of the plutonium from a bomb explosion is formed by the neutron capture of 238U; this plutonium is not converted by the bomb into a high fired oxide, as it is formed more slowly. This formed plutonium is more soluble and more harmful as fallout.
Some plutonium can be deposited close to the point of detonation. The glassy trinitite formed by the Trinity bomb has been examined to determine what actinides and other radioisotopes it contained. A 2006 paper reports the levels of long lived radioisotopes in the trinitite. 152Eu and 154Eu was mainly formed by the neutron activation of the europium in the soil, and the level of radioactivity for these isotopes is highest where the neutron dose to the soil was larger. Some of the 60Co was generated by activation of the cobalt in the soil, but some was also generated by the activation of the cobalt in the steel (100 foot) tower on which the bomb stood. This 60Co from the tower would have been scattered over the site reducing the difference in the soil levels. 133Ba and 241Am were created by the neutron activation of barium and plutonium inside the bomb. The barium was present in the form of the nitrate in the chemical explosives used while the plutonium was the fissile fuel used.
As the 239Pu/240Pu ratio only changed slightly during the Trinity detonation, it has been commented that this isotope ratio for the majority of atomic bombs (in Japan the 239Pu/240Pu ratio in soil is normally in the range 0.17 to 0.19) is very different than from the bomb dropped upon Nagasaki.
Bomb safety trials.
Plutonium has also been released into the environment in "safety trials". In these experiments, nuclear bombs have been subjected to simulated accidents or detonated with an abnormal initiation of their chemical explosives. An abnormal implosion will result in a compression of the plutonium pit, which is less uniform and smaller than the designed compression in the device. In these experiments where no or very little nuclear fission occurs, plutonium metal has been scattered around the test sites. While some of these tests have been done underground, other such tests were conducted in open air. A paper on the radioisotopes left on an island by the French nuclear bombs tests of the 20th century has been printed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and a section of this report deals with plutonium contamination resulting from such tests.
Other related trials were conducted at Maralinga, South Australia where both normal bomb detonations and "safety trials" have been conducted. While the activity from the fission products has decayed away almost totally (as of 2006) the plutonium remains active.
Space.
Plutonium can also be introduced into the environment via the reentry of artificial satellites containing atomic batteries. There have been several such incidents, the most prominent being the Apollo 13 mission. The Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package carried on the Lunar Module re-entered the atmosphere over the South Pacific. Many atomic batteries have been of the Radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) type. The Plutonium-238 used in RTGs has a half-life of 88 years, as opposed to the plutonium-239 used in nuclear weapons and reactors, which has a half-life of 24,100 years. In April 1964 a SNAP-9A failed to achieve orbit and disintegrated, dispersing roughly of plutonium-238 over all continents. Most plutonium fell in the southern hemisphere. An estimated 6300 GBq or 2100 man-Sv of radiation was released and led to NASA's development of solar photovoltaic energy technology.
Chain reactions do not occur inside RTGs, so a nuclear meltdown is impossible. In fact, some RTGs are designed so that fission does not occur at all; rather, forms of radioactive decay which cannot trigger other radioactive decays are used instead. As a result, the fuel in an RTG is consumed much more slowly and much less power is produced. RTGs are still a potential source of radioactive contamination: if the container holding the fuel leaks, the radioactive material will contaminate the environment. The main concern is that if an accident were to occur during launch or a subsequent passage of a spacecraft close to Earth, harmful material could be released into the atmosphere. However, this event is extremely unlikely with current RTG cask designs.
In order to decrease the risk of the radioactive material being released, the fuel is typically stored in individual modular units with their own heat shielding. They are surrounded by a layer of iridium metal and encased in high-strength graphite blocks. These two materials are corrosion and heat-resistant. Surrounding the graphite blocks is an aeroshell, designed to protect the entire assembly against the heat of reentering the Earth's atmosphere. The plutonium fuel is also stored in a ceramic form that is heat-resistant, decreasing the risk of vaporization and aerosolization. The ceramic is also highly insoluble.
The US Department of Energy has conducted seawater tests and determined that the graphite casing, which was designed to withstand reentry, is stable and no release of plutonium should occur. Subsequent investigations have found no increase in the natural background radiation in the area. The 1970 Apollo 13 crisis represents an extreme scenario due to the high re-entry velocities of the craft returning from cislunar space. This accident has served to validate the design of later-generation RTGs as highly safe.
Nuclear fuel cycle.
Plutonium has been released into the environment in aqueous solution from nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment plants. The chemistry of this plutonium is different from that of the metal oxides formed from nuclear bomb detonations.
One example of a site where plutonium entered the soil is Rocky Flats where in the recent past XANES (X-ray spectroscopy) has been used to determine the chemical nature of the plutonium in the soil. The XANES was used to determine the oxidation state of the plutonium, while EXAFS was used to investigate the structure of the plutonium compound present in the soil and concrete.
Chernobyl.
Because plutonium oxide is involatile, most of the plutonium in the reactor was not released during the fire. However that which was released can be measured. V.I. Yoschenko et al. reported that grass and forest fires can make the caesium, strontium and plutonium become mobile in the air again.
Fukushima.
The ongoing crisis at this site includes Spent Fuel Pools on the upper floors, exposed to the elements with complex MOX and plutonium products. The Japanese Government Taskforce has asked for submissions to the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning in regards to the ongoing Contaminated Water Issues.
Nuclear crime.
There have been 18 incidents concerning theft or loss of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium confirmed by the IAEA.
One case exists of a German man who attempted to poison his ex-wife with plutonium stolen from WAK (Wiederaufbereitungsanlage Karlsruhe), a small scale reprocessing plant where he worked. He did not steal a large amount of plutonium, just rags used for wiping surfaces and a small amount of liquid waste. The man was sent to prison for his crime. At least two other people were contaminated by the plutonium. Two flats in Rhineland-Palatinate were also contaminated. These were later cleaned at a cost of two million euros.
Environmental chemistry.
Overview.
Plutonium, like other actinides, readily forms a dioxide plutonyl core (PuO2). In the environment, this plutonyl core readily complexes with carbonate as well as other oxygen moieties (OH−, NO2−, NO3−, and SO42−) to form charged complexes which can be readily mobile with low affinities to soil.
PuO2 formed from neutralizing highly acidic nitric acid solutions tends to form polymeric PuO2 which is resistant to complexation. Plutonium also readily shifts valences between the +3, +4, +5 and +6 states. It is common for some fraction of plutonium in solution to exist in all of these states in equilibrium.
Binding to soil.
Plutonium is known to bind to soil particles very strongly (see above for an X-ray spectroscopic study of plutonium in soil and concrete). While caesium has very different chemistry to the actinides, it is well known that both caesium and many of the actinides bind strongly to the minerals in soil. Hence it has been possible to use 134Cs labeled soil to study the migration of Pu and Cs in soils. It has been shown that colloidal transport processes control the migration of Cs (and will control the migration of Pu) in the soil at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant according to R.D. Whicker and S.A. Ibrahim. J.D. Chaplin et al. recently reported advances in the Diffusive gradients in thin films technique, which have provided a method to measure labile bioavailable Plutonium in soils, as well as in freshwater and seawater.
Microbiological chemistry.
Mary Neu (at Los Alamos in the USA) has done some work which suggests that bacteria can accumulate plutonium because the iron transport systems used by the bacteria also function as plutonium transport systems.
Biology.
Plutonium ingested by or injected into humans is transported in the transferrin based iron(III) transport system and then is stored in the liver in the iron store (ferritin), after an exposure to plutonium it is important to rapidly inject the subject with a chelating agent such as calcium complex of DTPA. This antidote is useful for a single exposure such as that which would occur if a glove box worker were to cut his or her hand with a plutonium-contaminated object. The calcium complex has faster metal binding kinetics than the zinc complex but if the calcium complex is used for a long time it tends to remove important minerals from the person. The zinc complex is less able to cause these effects.
Plutonium that is inhaled by humans lodges in the lungs and is slowly translocated to the lymph nodes. Inhaled plutonium has been shown to lead to lung cancer in experimental animals.

High endothelial venules

High endothelial venules (HEV) are specialized post-capillary venules characterized by plump endothelial cells as opposed to the usual flatter endothelial cells found in regular venules. HEVs enable lymphocytes circulating in the blood to directly enter a lymph node (by crossing through the HEV).
In humans, HEVs are found in all secondary lymphoid organs (with the exception of spleen, where blood exits through open arterioles and enters the red pulp), including hundreds of lymph nodes dispersed in the body, tonsils and adenoids in the pharynx, Peyer's patches (PIs) in the small intestine, appendix, and small aggregates of lymphoid tissue in the stomach and large intestine. In contrast to the endothelial cells from other vessels, the high endothelial cells of HEVs have a distinctive appearance, consisting of a cuboidal morphology and with various receptors to interact with leukocytes (express specialized ligands for lymphocytes and are able to support high levels of lymphocyte extravasation). HEVs enable naïve lymphocytes to move in and out of the lymph nodes from the circulatory system. HEV cells express addressins, which are specific adhesion molecules that attach to the L-selectins on lymphocytes and anchor them to the HEV wall in preparation for crossing the endothelium.
The endothelial cells of HEVs have a 'plump' appearance different from the flat morphology of endothelial cells that line other vessels, and are therefore called high endothelial cells by reference to their thickness. Another characteristic of HEVs, revealed by light-microscopic examination, is the presence of a large number of lymphocytes within their walls. This illustrates the function of HEVs in lymphocyte recruitment and explains why these vessels were implicated in lymphocyte traffic from the time of their initial description.
The need for HEV.
In order to have an adaptive immune response occur, T cells need to be activated. T cells become activated by recognising foreign antigens bound to antigen presenting cells (APC), in particular, dendritic cells. In order for naïve T cells to bind to their specific antigen, they need to experience physical contact with those cells. Since antigen levels are usually low, contact in blood circulation would be unlikely. Therefore, T cells need a region where they can go to sample foreign antigens that have entered the body. When an APC, such as a dendritic cell, binds a foreign antigen, it becomes activated and moves into the lymph nodes (sites for antigen sampling by T cells) via afferent lymphatic vessels. Naïve T cells in the circulation regularly move through the lymph nodes via HEV in order to scan the APC for foreign antigens. When they encounter such an antigen, the cell becomes activated, resulting in the immune system mounting a response against the causative agent of the infection.
Depletion of CD11c+ dendritic cells in mouse significantly altered the phenotype of HEV. The normal phenotype of HEV is possibly maintained by DC-secreted lymphotoxin (TNF-beta).
Cell movement through HEV.
HEV cuboidal endothelial cells express the adhesion molecules GlyCAM-1 (in mucosal HEV this is MAdCAM-1), ICAM-1 and CD34. They also secrete the chemokine CCL21. Naïve T cells express CCR7 receptor and adhesion molecules L-selectin and LFA-1. As naïve T cells move through the circulation, they 'roll' over the endothelial cells in the vessel walls. The rolling mechanism helps the L-selectin molecules on the surface of naive T cells to weakly interact with GlyCAM-1 and CD34 molecules on HEV cells. The chemokine CCL21 then binds to its receptor CCR7 expressed on the T cell. This binding induces a conformational change in the LFA-1 molecule causing it to bind tightly to ICAM-1. This tight binding stops further movement of the T cell which can then move between HEV cells into the lymph node by a process termed 'diapedesis' (or extravasation).
Markers.
Despite intensive efforts, few HEV-specific markers have been described. The best HEV marker currently available is a carbohydrate epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody (mAb) MECA-79, which stains all HEVs within lymphoid tissues and does not react with postcapillary venules or large vessels in spleen, thymus or nonlymphoid tissues. MECA-79 mAb inhibits lymphocyte emigration
through HEVs into lymph nodes "in vivo" and lymphocyte adhesion to lymph node and tonsil HEVs "in vitro". Although initially produced against mouse HEVs, the mAb shows a wide crossreactivity among species. The MECA-79 carbohydrate epitope decorates a family of HEV counter-receptors for L-selectin, both in mouse and human16. Another mAb, HECA-452, recognizing a carbohydrate epitope expressed on human HEVs but not on other vessels, has been described. Nevertheless, unlike MECA-79, this mAb is not HEV specific: HECA-452 recognizes a carbohydrate epitope related to the sialyl-Lewis x and sialyl-Lewis a oligosaccharides and, in addition to reacting with high endothelium, crossreacts with monocytic cells, dendritic cells and a subset of skin-homing memory lymphocytes.
Furthermore, two other HEV markers have been described in the mouse: 
In chronic human inflammatory disease.
The vessels with HEV characteristics appear in human tissue in association with long-standing chronic inflammation. In rheumatoid arthritis, it has been observed that the level of sulfate incorporation as well as the 'plumpness' (or 'tallness') of the endothelium in areas of lymphocytic infiltration in the synovial membrane are closely related to the concentration of the lymphocytes in the perivascular infiltrates. Similarly, expression of MECA-79 and HECA-452 on these vessels is most pronounced in association with extensive lymphoid infiltrates. Therefore, the development of bona fide HEVs in the synovial membrane of patients with rheumatoid arthritis is likely to facilitate large-scale influx of lymphocytes, leading to amplification and maintenance of chronic inflammation. The development of HEVs after prolonged inflammatory stimulus is not restricted to diseased synovium, but can also occur in other tissues, particularly the gut and thyroid. During chronic inflammation of the gut in inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) or the thyroid in autoimmune thyroiditis (Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis), areas of dense lymphocytic infiltration contain vessels with plump endothelium expressing MECA-79 and HECA-452. These observations suggest that HEVs could play an important role in the pathogenesis of these diseases by mediating abnormal lymphocyte recruitment to the gut or the thyroid. MECA-79+ venules with plump endothelium have also been detected in other sites of chronic inflammation, including many cutaneous inflammatory lesions. The presence of MECA-79+ HEV-like vessels in many different human chronic inflammatory diseases indicates that L-selectin is likely to play a major role in lymphocyte emigration at chronic inflammatory sites.

Ethnic Chinese in Brunei

Ethnic Chinese in Brunei are individuals of full or partial Chinese descent, primarily Han Chinese, who are either citizens or residents of the country. As of 2015, they make up 10.1% of Brunei's population, making them the second largest ethnic group. Brunei is home to one of the smaller overseas Chinese communities, with many Chinese people in the country being stateless.
Ethnic Chinese in Brunei were encouraged to settle due to their commercial and business acumen, with the largest subgroup being the Hokkien, many of whom originated from Kinmen and Xiamen in China, followed by smaller groups of Hakka and Cantonese. Despite their relatively small numbers, the Hokkien have a significant presence in Brunei's private and business sectors, contributing their entrepreneurial expertise and often partnering with Malaysian Chinese enterprises in joint ventures. The non-state commercial sector in Brunei has been largely dominated by ethnic Chinese who immigrated during the British colonial era.
History.
Early interactions.
According to the "Taiping Huanyu Ji", Brunei (Boni) was one of the earliest kingdoms in Southeast Asia, having sent its first envoy to China in 977. Chinese Muslims were also present in Brunei during the 13th century, as evidenced by historical records and archaeological findings, such as Song dynasty ceramics and Chinese brass coins. The significant historical role of the Chinese in Brunei is further underscored by legends and tales of interethnic marriages, including the famous story of Ong Sum Ping, a Chinese official who married the daughter of Sultan Muhammad Shah.
Due to a downturn in Southeast Asian trade, caused by the Chola invasion of Srivijaya (in 1017, 1025, and around 1070) and the restructuring of trade by the Northern Song, Brunei had to wait until 1082—over a century after its first mission—to send a second embassy to China. During the 11th century, the dominant power in the region, Srivijaya, sent only five embassies to China. Nevertheless, trade with Southeast Asia flourished in the 12th century following the fall of the Chola Empire, and Brunei was recorded in Chinese texts in 1151 and 1206. By 1225, Brunei's significance in the Nanyang trade was highlighted by Zhao Rukuo, who noted that the country's main exports were tortoise shells and camphor, exchanged for Chinese fabrics and pottery. Islam began spreading through Quanzhou, and by the 13th century, records show the presence of Chinese Muslims in Brunei, including a merchant named Master Pu. A Spanish source from 1578 also confirms the existence of a mosque and Muslim rulers in Brunei, where both Chinese and indigenous populations had converted to Islam.
Despite the rise of Singhasari in Eastern Java, which controlled the spice trade in the Maluku Islands, Brunei's trade with China grew during the second half of the 13th century. Following the defeat of Singhasari by the Mongols in 1292, Majapahit emerged as a significant power and extended its tribute relations to Brunei in the 14th century. After the Sulu chiefdom launched incursions—eventually quashed with Javanese assistance—Brunei's capital was moved from Limau Manis to Kota Batu. In 1371, Brunei sent an envoy after Emperor Hongwu initiated the Ming dynasty's maritime policy in 1368. As China sought to control sea lanes, Brunei's significance grew under Emperor Yongle, particularly following his battle for succession. After Admiral Zheng He's expedition to the region in 1405, Brunei sent an envoy to Nanjing. In 1408, the mountain "protecting" Brunei was granted the title of "everlasting protector of the country," possibly influencing the name Darussalam. Brunei's trade prospered despite Malacca's strategic importance in China's maritime policy, with the country's first Arabic stele being carved in Quanzhou in the 14th century.
During the first sixty years of the Ming dynasty, Brunei's political elite converted to Islam, influenced by Malays from northern Sumatra and Arabs from Taif. Brunei reached its peak between the late 15th century and the Spanish attack of 1578, with the sultanate engaging in extensive regional trade, particularly in nutmegs and cloves. Following the lifting of Ming trade restrictions in 1567, Brunei’s trade with southern China flourished, importing silk, gold, ceramics, and second-hand iron, while exporting goods such as bird's nests, slaves, wax, pearls, bezoar stones, camphor, and tortoise-shells. Despite a small Chinese community in Tanjung Batu and Muara, Brunei controlled much of the regional trade.
Beginning of the Chinese population.
Trade with China diminished after the Spanish attack in 1571 and the loss of the Manila vassalage, which benefited Sulu and Manila. Negotiations between the sultan and the Spanish in 1682 to restore Chinese trade collapsed when the Spanish insisted on sending Chinese settlers accompanied solely by Catholic priests. By the early 18th century, however, Chinese farmers had settled along the Brunei River to cultivate pepper, following the resumption of trade with southern China after the Qing conquest of Taiwan and the easing of maritime trade restrictions. Junks from Amoy and Macau frequently arrived, and the Chinese continued to trade despite external challenges from the Bugis and Sulus, as well as internal disputes. By the late 18th century, large junks were built on the Brunei River by Chinese carpenters, and by the early 19th century, Chinese individuals made up half of Brunei's population, mostly engaged in the pepper trade.
Unable to secure assistance from either the British or the Spanish, Brunei faced growing pressure from Sulu on Borneo's northwest coast. By 1810, continuous raids had driven Chinese junks out of Brunei Bay. The discovery of antimony in Sarawak in the 1820s reignited interest in the region. In 1824, the sultan sent an embassy to Singapore to introduce the mineral, along with customary commodities. He appointed Pengiran Indera Mahkota as administrator of Sarawak in 1827. He founded Kuching and employed Chinese labour to explore the mines. James Brooke became embroiled in disputes between Pengiran Indera Mahkota and Pengiran Muda Hashim. By 1906, when Brunei ceded its sovereignty to the British, the Chinese community had virtually disappeared, as the sultanate's authority declined, and it lost a large portion of its land.
According to Malcolm Stewart Hannibal McArthur, the British envoy, there were approximately 500 Chinese living in Brunei in 1904, a figure nearly 20 times smaller than in 1800 (based on the lowest estimate). The actual number of Chinese would likely have been closer to 300, as McArthur overstated Brunei's population by one-third (according to the first census in 1911). In Labuan, which had been ceded to the British in 1846, most individuals were listed as British subjects. Despite this population decline, Chinese traders continued to control much of the region’s trade, including retail and parts of the commodity trade, such as the sale of sago, rattan, and other goods to Singapore. In areas like Belait District (Goh Ah Lai) and Tutong District (Chi Ki Yi), the wealthiest Chinese traders could impose import duties or levies, as they also operated as moneylenders at their own risk.
The last sago plant under the sultanate was owned by Chua Chang Hee, a prominent Brunei businessman, and it closed soon after Sarawak took control of Limbang in 1890. It is possible that his family had been involved in minting Sultan Abdul Momin's coins in 1865, as coin crests were produced in many Malay states prior to European arrival. Other Chinese in Brunei worked as fishermen, craftspeople, or woodcutters in the forestry sector. The Cheok family, under the leadership of Cheok Yu, became the wealthiest in Brunei. Cheok Boon Siok, another member of the family, secured the British government's opium revenue monopoly in 1908. Other influential families included the Gohs, Ongs, and Angs, with the Ang family being the oldest. According to family tradition, the first Angs arrived in Brunei before James Brooke, and in 1919, a Chinese partnership, supported financially by Cheok Boon Siok, cleared and planted the first significant tract of irrigated rice farming.
Between 1911 and 1921, the Chinese population in Brunei doubled, rising from 3% to 5% of the total population due to improved healthcare. In 1912, the first Chinese primary school, York Choi School (now Chung Hwa Middle School), opened and taught Mandarin, a rarity in North Borneo. By 1929, attendance was mandatory for boys, and by 1941, five private Chinese primary schools existed, with some students attending Catholic schools. In 1918, the Qemoy (Kinmen) Hokkien built Tengyun Temple, the first Chinese temple, which contributed to an increase in Chinese immigration, bringing their representation to 9% by 1931. The discovery of oil in Seria in 1929 and the founding of the first Hainanese Association in 1939 further boosted the Chinese population, which reached 20% by 1947. However, Brunei lacked secondary schools, and families had to send their children to Labuan when English was introduced in 1936, creating a cultural divide. Belait became a modern hub within a more traditional society.
Despite these developments, much of Brunei's modern industry, including coal mining in Brooketon (present-day Muara), was controlled by Westerners, particularly the Brookes, which kept the average income of Bruneian Chinese relatively modest compared to their counterparts in the Straits Settlements. The Chinese traders and Malay pengiran lost their land and customs privileges, weakening their economic power. The Japanese invasion in December 1941 halted economic progress and shut down all Chinese schools. Despite a relatively gentle start to the occupation, the Chinese and Malays were subjected to harsh treatment, with many massacred in Brunei Town (now Bandar Seri Begawan). Nevertheless, the majority of Brunei's Chinese population survived.
Post-war economy and policies.
Tensions between the Chinese and Malays in Brunei intensified after the reinstatement of British civil authority in July 1946. In mid-1946, Chinese workers at the Seria oil field went on strike due to supply shortages, and were replaced by both Chinese and Indian workers. This unrest coincided with nationalist movements opposing any merger with Sarawak, which had been transferred to British control in July 1946. The "Pengiran Bendahara", Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin's brother, supported the "Barisan Pemuda", a nationalist movement that included the radical "Kumpulan Ganyang China" (Group for Crushing the Chinese). BARIP demanded the recruitment of Malays into an administration dominated by English-speaking Chinese, and in early 1947, enforced the closure of Chinese shops during the sultan's mother's funeral to assert Malay dominance.
Between 1947 and 1960, Brunei's Chinese population grew 2.6 times, reaching 26% of the total population, largely driven by the oil boom. The resurgence in consumption led to the founding of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce (CCC) in 1947, and by the 1950s and 1960s, two geo-dialectal associations were established to represent the influx of Sarawakian Hakkas and Fuzhous. The issue of citizenship became prominent with the constitution of Brunei and the preparations for Brunei's first general elections, which required non-indigenous applicants to demonstrate long-term residence and pass a Malay language exam.
In 1950, the "Pengiran Bendahara" became Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III. In 1953, the sultan tripled corporate taxes, and with a 100-fold increase in oil revenue between 1946 and 1952, new social policies were introduced. The first secondary school opened in Brunei Town in 1951, followed by a second in Kuala Belait. The government funded half of the operating costs for Chinese schools, which began offering secondary education in 1954, and made primary Malay schools free. The sultan also introduced the concept of "Melayu Islam Beraja" (MIB), which defined Malayness through monarchy and religion, while reaffirming the significance of Islamic festivals like Hari Raya. The issue of citizenship was brought up during the planning of the first general elections after the 1959 Brunei Agreement with the British. The "Brunei Nationality Act" of December 1961 granted citizenship automatically to "indigenous races" (such as Dayaks), while requiring other applicants to demonstrate 20 years of residency during the previous 25 years and pass a difficult Malay language test. After the 1962 Brunei revolt, which opposed Brunei's incorporation into a Malaysian Federation, the 1964 "Brunei Nationality Act" made identity cards compulsory, enforcing the registration of residents and restricting immigration, and since then, three types of ID cards have been issued: yellow for citizens, red for permanent residents, and green for long-term residents.
Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah persuaded the Legislative Council (LegCo) to eliminate the 1970 subsidies given to Catholic schools in order to demonstrate the Islamic aspect of Bruneian society. By 1971, Chinese Bruneians were a key part of the workforce, with 75% employed in trade, construction, and administration. Construction became their primary industry, leading to the creation of the Brunei Construction Association in 1964 and the Chinese Engineering Association in 1976. The Chinese also made inroads into banking, with the establishment of the Khoo Teck Puat's National Bank of Brunei in 1964 and United National Finance in 1975. As the economy boomed, Chinese associations prospered, such as the Hainanese Association's Brunei Town branch in 1968 and the Taiwan Graduates Association in 1970. Community-based associations, including the Brunei Tai Poo Association (Hakka) and the Brunei Qiong Zhou Association (Hainanese), were founded in the late 1970s and early 1980s, reflecting the growing influence of the Hainanese and Cantonese communities. Meanwhile, the proportion of Chinese in Brunei's population began to decline, dropping to 23% in 1971 and 20% by 1981, with half residing in the Belait District.
With increased oil wealth, economic power shifted to the sultan, allowing him to promote Malay language, Brunei's history, and Islamic values. Since 1979, property acquisitions and long-term leases have required the sultan's approval, and Chinese citizens were unofficially limited to acres of land. Despite official approval, Chinese land acquisitions could not be registered. In 1983, the sultan sought to ease tensions by reaffirming the protection of non-Islamic groups' rights and promoting Chinese commercial expertise for the benefit of Malays. The Sultan attended the CCC's annual banquet and appointed Chinese Bruneian Lim Jock Seng as secretary for ASEAN affairs, recognising his contributions.
Independence and the MIB philosophy.
The supremacy of the Brunei Malays was solidified when the royal titah (speech) elevated the concept of MIB to official ideology during the independence celebrations on 31 December 1983. The "Brunei Nationality Act" was amended in 1984 to extend the mandatory residency period for citizenship to 25 years. While Chinese schools were initially allowed to continue using Chinese as the medium of instruction, the creation of an MIB committee in 1985 led to the introduction of bilingual Malay/English instruction. As Islamic fundamentalism gained momentum, MIB was enforced more strictly, reaching its zenith in 1990 when it was declared to be "God's will." By 1992, Chinese courses were relegated to supplementary subjects, and Chinese was no longer used as a teaching medium in schools. Consequently, by the early 2000s, Chinese language proficiency had declined significantly.
Initially, the two dozen Chinese associations registered in Brunei were not directly affected by MIB. However, after China’s official recognition in the 1990s, new organisations emerged, including the Sino-Bruneian Association of Friendship in 1992 and the Bandar Seri Begawan branch of the Hokkien Association in 1998. A 2005 regulation requiring all leaders and board members of Chinese associations to be Bruneians further strengthened the government’s control over the community, even though the historical significance of the Chinese community was acknowledged. As a result, the government's authority over Chinese community organisations grew. Since 1984, discrimination against Chinese citizens and non-citizens has been entrenched in Brunei Malays' rule, with MIB further entrenching this power. For example, Chinese landowners faced pressure to sell their properties to Malays. This, combined with the dominance of the state-controlled hydrocarbons sector and royal family-backed businesses, led to a reduction in the Chinese population, which dropped from 20.5% in 1981 to 11% in 2001. Emigration contributed to negative demographic growth, despite a steady birth rate. By 2001, there were 37,056 Chinese in the country, down from 40,621 in 1991. However, by 2009, the population had grown to over 43,700, with the Hokkien being the largest group, primarily residing in the Brunei–Muara District.
In 2001, 44.7% of Brunei’s Chinese population was actively employed, compared to just 32.6% of the Malay population. This higher activity rate among the Chinese was largely due to two factors: first, the restriction that only citizens could retire in Brunei, which led many Chinese retirees to leave, and second, the trend of young, educated Chinese seeking job opportunities abroad. At that time, 25% of Chinese workers were employed in highly skilled occupations such as management, law, and administration, 30% in specialised fields such as technology and clerical work, and 30% in the retail trade and craft industries. Despite regulations limiting foreign staff, Chinese Bruneians now hold senior roles in the financial sector, even though Chinese-owned institutions faced setbacks, such as the bankruptcies of the 1980s. While the minister of education, Abdul Aziz Umar, promoted Malay supremacy in the private sector, little has changed in terms of economic representation.
It has apparently been simpler for Chinese to acquire citizenship or permanent residency if they convert to Islam, according to a 2008 UNHCR assessment. Chinese Christians encounter challenges when attempting to live out their beliefs. The government has denied authorisation to construct churches and work permits for foreign priests. Many Christians feel compelled to use homes and businesses as places of worship. Similar issues affect Chinese people who follow traditional religions like Buddhism and Taoism. At the annual meeting of the LegCo in 2015, Goh King Chin, a member of the parliament, suggested amending the "Brunei Nationality Act" and providing provisions for citizenship to stateless people 60 years of age and older. But in the end, this proposal was rejected by Abu Bakar Apong, the minister of home affairs, who said that the existing nationality regulations were adequate and that stateless people were provided official travel credentials in lieu of passports.
Demographics.
The Hokkien are the largest Chinese subgroup; many of them are from China's Kinmen and Xiamen provinces. Smaller percentages of the Chinese population are Hakka and Cantonese. 
Society.
Identity.
MIB rejects pluralism and institutionalises a monocultural Malay Muslim identity. Although Brunei does not embrace multi-racialism, Zain Serudin, in "The Malay Islamic Monarchy: A Closer Understanding" (2013), argues this stance is not inherently anti-Malay. He advocates openness to new values that contribute to the nation's success while cautioning against external influences. This highlights Brunei's ambivalent stance on multiculturalism, reflecting both the perceived threats and potential benefits of non-Malay communities, particularly the Brunei Chinese, who are often viewed with suspicion and positioned as the alienated "other."
The treatment of Brunei's Chinese population underscores broader issues surrounding the construction of "citizen" and "stateless" identities. Under MIB principles, Malay ethnicity is central to Brunei's definition of citizenship, which signifies both legal status and belonging. This creates a disparity: the "Brunei Nationality Act" (1961) automatically grants citizenship to recognised Malay indigenous communities, while non-Malays must apply through registration or naturalisation. Government policies further reinforce the privileged status of Brunei Malays as "authentic" locals and natural heirs to the sultanate, conflating Malayness with indigeneity and Islam. This framework marginalises non-Malay minorities like the Brunei Chinese by tying citizenship to ethnic and cultural identity.
Brunei's citizenship policy is based on the concept of a "community of descent," where citizenship is determined by lineage ("jus sanguinis") rather than birthplace ("jus soli"). Native identity is validated through ancestry, with Brunei Malays—referred to as "pribumi", "bumiputera", or "anak Brunei"—enjoying privileged citizenship since independence as part of the sultanate's historical heritage. This system exemplifies "racialised citizenship," characterised by preferential treatment for Brunei Malays and institutionalised discrimination against other ethnic groups.
While Malays are granted automatic full citizenship, Chinese residents face an uncertain status. Following independence, only a third of Chinese residents were granted citizenship, leaving the majority stateless. Before independence, most Chinese were classified as British protected persons. Stateless Chinese must meet strict requirements to apply for citizenship, including passing a notoriously difficult Malay language test and residing in the country for 20 out of the past 25 years. The language test remains the primary barrier, and even those who pass it often face prolonged bureaucratic delays. As a result, despite many Chinese residents being second- or third-generation, up to 90% remain stateless. As of 2022, Chinese residents make up 10.3% of Brunei's population.
In Brunei, "stateless" status has multiple implications. Stateless individuals, recognised as permanent residents through their purple identity cards, are allowed to live in the country but are excluded from key citizenship privileges such as property ownership, obtaining a passport, and accessing government benefits. Citizenship, symbolised by a yellow identity card, is highly coveted as it grants access to free healthcare, education, and property rights. However, distinctions persist even among Bruneian Chinese. Non-Muslim Chinese citizens are categorised as "Cina Brunei" or "Cina Kitani", while those who convert to Islam and assimilate fully may be recognised as "orang Melayu Brunei". Yet even with citizenship, Chinese individuals often face second-class treatment due to informal ethnic and racial hierarchies. This disparity is further accentuated by preferential policies for Malays, such as land resettlement schemes, underscoring Brunei's uneasy relationship with its Chinese population.
Economic aptitude.
The ethnic Chinese were encouraged to settle in Brunei due to their commercial and business expertise. Despite their relatively small numbers, the Hokkien community has a significant presence in Brunei’s private and business sectors, playing a key role in the country's commercial landscape and frequently collaborating with Malaysian Chinese enterprises in joint ventures. The non-state commercial sector in Brunei is largely dominated by ethnic Chinese who migrated during the British colonial period.
Both local Chinese and more recent immigrants from mainland China have contributed to the substantial growth of Chinese commerce in Brunei. With support from official organisations such as the CCC, local Chinese entrepreneurs make a considerable contribution to the national economy. These businesses promote the country's growth while maintaining strong ties with the Malay Chamber of Commerce. The presence of mainland Chinese also influences the economy, particularly through foreign direct investments such as Hengyi Industries' oil refinery. By adapting to Brunei's localisation process, which seeks to balance national identity with globalisation, local Chinese companies are essential to the diversification of the economy. Despite their marginalised status, the Chinese community holds significant economic power, with influential figures like Ong Kim Kee and Timothy Ong Teck Mong leading the private financial sector. This economic influence is seen as a potential challenge to Malay hegemony, prompting the state to implement measures designed to encourage Malay leadership within the private sector, although these efforts have yet to come to fruition.
Despite being governed by the land code and land code (strata), land purchase, ownership, and transfer in Brunei are complicated and opaque. Although citizens have the right to own and transfer land, the sultan-in-council and the Land Department have the last say over who can own property for foreigners and permanent residents. Land concerns are heavily influenced by cultural and national identity, especially when the monarchy's economic and cultural authority was solidified with the discovery of oil and gas. As a result, land ownership limitations and the promotion of national ideals were implemented. Since 1979, the sultan has had to approve all purchases or long-term leases, regardless of the buyer's background. Chinese nationals are also subject to unofficial restrictions, such as a two-hectare cap and the inability to register their purchases, even if they are authorised and paid for.
Political activities.
A "Kapitan Cina" was a member of the State Council, the nation's executive branch, in 1921. George Newn Ah Foot also served on the State Council from 1955 to 1958 following World War II. Hong Kok Tin, who subsequently served as assistant minister of medicine and health from 1965 to 1970, was a member of the Executive Council when the 1959 constitution was introduced. The LegCo also had Chinese members such Yap Chung Teck, Chong Seng Toh, Hong Kok Tin, Othman @ Chua Kwang Soon, and George Newn Ah Foot. Regardless of the fact that one of the four police officers killed during the 1962 revolt was Chinese, the Chinese population in Brunei had no involvement in the rebellion. Prominent Chinese individuals have historically represented their community despite their political neutrality. For instance, Ong Boon Pang was appointed "Kapitan Cina" by the sultan in 1932, and later, Lim Cheng Choo played a key role in drafting Brunei's 1959 constitution and signed the 1979 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation.
A number of Bruneian Chinese have achieved high-level government positions. Despite the financial difficulties after Prince Jefri Bolkiah's Amedeo Development Corporation collapsed, Amin Liew Abdullah, who joined the Brunei Investment Agency in 1997 and rose to the position of managing director in 2005, later held the position of permanent secretary in the Ministry of Industry and Primary Resources in 2008. Up until 2010, Timothy Ong, who comes from one of Brunei's oldest Chinese families, oversaw economic diversification as acting head of the Brunei Economic Development Board. Several other Bruneian Chinese have permanent secretarial positions, such as in the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs, while Paul Kong serves as the General Assurance Association's acting chairman.
To symbolically highlight the value of the Chinese workforce, the Chinese elite is integrated into the Bruneian establishment through the "adat istiadat", following a dual pattern. First, to incorporate the modern administrative elite into the hierarchical structure of traditional Bruneian society, commoners holding government offices are granted titles such as "Pehin" or "Dato". For example, Lim Jock Seng, the second Minister of Foreign Affairs since May 2005, has held the chairmanship of Brunei Shell Petroleum in 2008. Like other Pehins, Chinese Pehins swear an oath of allegiance to the sultan, reciting a "chiri" (mantra) that combines Arabic and Sanskrit, based on their rank. Additionally, Chinese community leaders, such as the chairmen of major associations, serve as registrars for Chinese marriages under the authority of local officials.
The royal family's involvement in Chinese New Year celebrations since 2006 and the appointment of traditional dignitaries to important community positions demonstrate Brunei's acceptance of the Chinese community as an essential component of its society. These include the Onn Siew Siong, based in Kuala Belait, and Lau Ah Kok and Goh King Chin, both of whom were formerly members of the LegCo and now reside in the Brunei–Muara District. Since Brunei normalised relations with Beijing in 1991, the Chinese community has continuously reaffirmed its support for the "one China" policy, despite the Qemoy Hokkien being the majority group. This shows allegiance to the sultan's authority.
Goh King Chin has represented the Chinese minority and addressed important problems pertaining to their welfare ever since the LegCo was resurrected in 2004 after a 20-year break. The first female deputy minister was Adina Othman @ Chua, an ethnic Chinese Muslim who worked at the Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports from 2010 to 2015. A member of the Chinese ethnic community, Steven Chong Wan Oon is a judge and judicial commissioner on the high court.
Culture.
Language.
The Chinese community in Brunei speaks several dialects, including Min Nan, Mandarin, Min Dong, Yue, Hakka, Cantonese, Hokkien, Foo Chow, and Teo Chew, with many also speaking English at home. However, the use of these dialects is declining, as younger generations are increasingly raised to speak English exclusively, and unofficial home schooling is the main way these dialects are preserved. Mandarin is taught in Chinese private schools alongside English and Malay, and its growing importance, particularly in business and economics, is reflected in the increasing number of Malay parents sending their children there. Nearly half of the Chinese population in Brunei are still temporary residents, and less than 25% are citizens. Brunei’s government does not provide official Chinese language instruction, contributing to the decline of dialect use in formal settings.
Literature.
The literary, intellectual, and cultural advancement of Brunei is influenced by the Chinese minority there. Although there has long been Chinese literature in Brunei, newer, English-educated generations have found resonance in the recent rise of Anglophone literature. Chinese Bruneian fiction, such as K. H. Lim's "Written in Black", reflects the intricate cultural dynamics of the society by examining topics of identity, migration, and familial life. Furthermore, in the backdrop of migration and loss, plays like "Tomorrow, the Sun Sets" explore emotional bonds, especially those between mothers and daughters. Poetry has also been used to convey identity and culture. In addition to providing social commentary, these literary works capture the experiences of the Chinese population, such as the difficulties associated with mental health issues and statelessness. Chinese Bruneian literature has a small market, but it is essential to maintaining cultural legacy and promoting awareness of the distinctive experiences of the Chinese diaspora in Brunei.
Religion.
As of May 2020, approximately 65% of Chinese in Brunei identify as Buddhist, 20% as Taoist, and 20% as Christian, with a smaller percentage identifying as Muslim. There are smaller numbers of Muslims, practitioners of other religions, and Irreligious individuals among the Chinese community in Brunei numbering a combined 15%.With Taoist temples spread across all four districts and Protestant and Catholic Christian churches in Bandar Seri Begawan, Seria, and Kuala Belait, the Chinese community in Brunei is granted religious freedom under the 1959 constitution. Cheok Boon Siok provided the funding for the first Chinese temple, the Teng Yun Temple, which was constructed in 1918 in Brunei Town and moved with government assistance in the 1950s. The temple continues to be a major site of worship where local Chinese congregate to honour their ancestors and commemorate Chinese holidays and customs, including the Chinese New Year. Cultural events such as lion dances are performed during these festivities, drawing in both the Chinese community and the general public, including visitors. These religious customs promote assimilation with Brunei's broader community while preserving Chinese cultural uniqueness. Furthermore, it is not unusual for Chinese Bruneians to convert to Islam, which reflects the religious variety of the country and the cultural assimilation taking place within the context of Brunei's MIB ideology.
The way the Chinese community views Malay-Chinese interactions and identity is significantly impacted when a Chinese person converts to Islam. It draws attention to the community's nuanced place in a culture that frequently marginalises Chinese men due to racialised preconceptions. Many Chinese people may view such a conversion as a rejection of their ethnic heritage and individualistic ideals when the convert sheds their prior selfish behaviours and takes on a new identity while embracing Islamic principles. The conversion is frequently seen as a step toward societal integration that is consistent with the Islamic concepts of responsibility and solidarity. The community's struggle with its position in a primarily Malay culture is also highlighted by this, as the individual's move from pursuing personal goals to concentrating on societal responsibility and unity may be interpreted as a reinforcement of the supremacy of Malay cultural and religious values. The Chinese community may have conflicting opinions about such conversions, acknowledging the person's assimilation into society while also addressing the more general issues of ethnic identity and how Chinese people are viewed inside the racially divided state.
Education.
Chinese schools with solid academic reputations attract both Chinese and non-Chinese students, offering Mandarin as a third language alongside Malay and English. To preserve their cultural identity, the Chinese community has established Chinese-language schools, blending cultural education with academics, and Chinese cultural associations are key to maintaining and passing down their heritage. The Chinese community places great importance on education, reflecting their commitment to Brunei's cultural and national development.
As of 2020, Brunei has eight Chinese schools: three offer education from kindergarten to Form Five, while five provide primary schooling. The intermediate schools are located in Bandar Seri Begawan and Belait, while primary schools are spread across Tutong, Belait, and Temburong districts. Over the past century, Chinese education has evolved from a system where Chinese was the primary medium of instruction to one where English is the main language, with Malay and Jawi as compulsory subjects. This shift has made learning Chinese more challenging, leading to a decline in language proficiency, exacerbated by a lack of government support and reduced use of Chinese in daily life.
Following the liberalisation of Brunei's education policy, private schools were allowed to offer Chinese language classes, though these are often basic due to limited resources and teaching methods. To promote intercommunity harmony, schools have introduced cultural activities such as lion dances, singing, and dancing. Even royal family members have started learning Chinese, signalling a move towards cultural integration. However, Chinese language education still faces challenges, including declining student interest and limited government support. Many community-funded Chinese schools struggle to remain open, and local Chinese associations are experiencing significant membership declines. Despite ongoing efforts, the future of Chinese education and culture in Brunei remains uncertain without greater support.

Edith Coleman

Edith Coleman (1874–1951) was an Australian naturalist and nature writer who made important observations on pollination syndromes in Australian plant species.
Early life.
Coleman was born Edith Harms on 29 July 1874 in Woking, Surrey. She emigrated with her family to Australia in 1887 and became a school teacher. In 1898, she married James G. Coleman, a pioneering motorist and founder of the RACV. They had two daughters, Dorothy and Gladys and moved to 'Walsham' in Blackburn, Victoria. Many of Coleman's early natural history work was conducted in the garden and bushland surrounding Walsham, as well as their cottage in Healesville and Sorrento, Victoria. She died on 3 June 1951 at Sorrento, Victoria.
Contributions to science.
Coleman joined the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria on 11 September 1922. She published over 350 popular and scientific articles from that time onwards in The Victorian Naturalist as well as newspapers and magazines. She published a singular book in her career about her observations on Victorian Wattles. She made significant scientific contributions to the study of many Australian species, including orchids, mistletoe, spiders, insects, birds and fish as well as papers on herbs, gardening and history.
Coleman's landmark paper on pseudocopulation in orchids resolved a long-standing mystery in orchid pollination which had puzzled many, including Charles Darwin. Her work demonstrated that, instead of producing nectar to attract pollinators, some orchid species mimicked female wasps with scent, visual and tactile cues so effectively that the male wasps preferentially copulate with (and pollinate) the orchids. Her work was republished internationally by Oxford biologist Edward Bagnall Poulton and acclaimed by Harvard entomologist Oakes Ames. She worked with and influenced many naturalists including Rica Erickson, Herman Rupp, Jean Galbraith, and Richard Sanders Rogers who named "Prasophyllum colemaniae" after her and her daughters.
Coleman was also an enthusiastic promoter of Australian (and English literature) in her writing and was regarded by Kate Baker as one of the foremost figures in Australian literature at the time.
Awards.
Coleman was awarded the Australian Natural History Medallion in 1949. She became the first woman in history to ever receive this honour.

Stratified columnar epithelium is a rare type of epithelial tissue composed of column-shaped cells arranged in multiple layers. It is found in the conjunctiva, pharynx, anus, and male urethra. It also occurs in embryo.
Location.
Stratified columnar epithelia are found in a variety of locations, including:
Embryology.
Stratified columnar epithelium is initially present in parts of the gastrointestinal tract in utero, before being replaced with other types of epithelium. For example, by 8 weeks, it covers the lining of the stomach. By 17 weeks, it is replaced by simple columnar epithelium. This is also found in the fetal esophagus.
Function.
The cells function in secretion and protection.

Kanda River

The stretches 24.6 km from Inokashira Park in Mitaka to the Sumida River under the Ryōgoku Bridge at the boundary of Taitō, Chūō, and Sumida. Its entire length lies within Tokyo, Japan. It drains an area of 105.0 km². The government of Japan classifies it as a Class I river.
Tributaries and branches.
The Zenpukuji, Momozono, and Myōshō-ji rivers are tributaries of the Kanda. The outer moat of the Imperial Palace is also a tributary. The Nihonbashi River is a distributary of the Kanda.
History.
Originally the lower part of the river ran southwards into an inlet of the sea that ran northwards to present-day Hibiya and Kokyo Gaien plaza. During the rule of the shogun Tokugawa Hidetada, the river was diverted to flow into the Sumida River, with the spoil from the diversion used to reclaim the cove at Hibiya.
In the middle section of the length of the river, there is a 2.1 km section from the area near Toden Arakawa Line Waseda Station to near Iidabashi Station which was formerly called . The name of this section was changed to Kanda River in August 1970, consistent with the name of the rest of the river. Most other nearby place names nearby deriving from "Edogawa" had disappeared by 1966, but some remain, including Edogawabashi Station, the bridge after which the station was named, and in Bunkyo, Tokyo. Additionally, until the late Meiji period, the banks of the river between and were considered to be one of the best cherry blossom sites in Tokyo.
Construction began in the 1980s of a diversion tunnel which could temporarily store excess water which historically has been a big problem causing flooding to thousands of homes during powerful typhoons or torrential downpours. The Kanda River Underground Diversion Channel is actually one huge tunnel built under major roads. The plan is to construct a 4.5-km tunnel, 13 m wide tunnel 40 meters below street level. The first 2 km section was completed in 1997, and it can hold the runoff of 50 mm of rain falling in one hour. The reservoir has drawn water from the river on more than a dozen occasions since it opened, and the Kanda River has not flooded during that time. Plans call for the tunnel to be extended to Tokyo Bay, literally creating a second, underground Kanda River.
In popular culture.
The folk group Kaguyahime released the song "Kandagawa" in 1973 and sold more than a million copies. Keiko Sekine (Takahashi) and Masao Kusakari starred in a film based on the song.
Japanese pianist "Nobuyuki Tsujii" composed the music "Whisper of the River" to express his love for his father after the two took a walk along the Kanda River.
The Kanda River is also featured prominently in the multimedia project Kandagawa Jet Girls. It serves as the venue for all of the anime version's Jet Racing and VR training sequences as well as assorted other activities throughout the series.

Acetoxy group

In organic chemistry, the acetoxy group (abbr. AcO– or –OAc; IUPAC name: acetyloxy), is a functional group with the formula and the structure . As the "-oxy" suffix implies, it differs from the acetyl group () by the presence of an additional oxygen atom. The name acetoxy is the short form of "acetyl-oxy".
Functionality.
An acetoxy group may be used as a protection for an alcohol functionality in a synthetic route although the protecting group itself is called an acetyl group.
Alcohol protection.
There are several options of introducing an acetoxy functionality in a molecule from an alcohol (in effect protecting the alcohol by acetylation):
An alcohol is not a particularly strong nucleophile and, when present, more powerful nucleophiles like amines will react with the above-mentioned reagents in preference to the alcohol.

William Sage III (born April 3, 1962) is an American actor. He is known for his collaborations with director Hal Hartley. Sage has appeared in more than 90 movies, most notable "American Psycho" (2000), "We Are What We Are" (2013), "Every Secret Thing" (2014), and "Wrong Turn" (2021). 
Life and career.
Sage was born and raised in New York City and graduated from the State University of New York at Purchase. Beginning in eighth grade, Sage became a victim of child sexual abuse, an experience that would later influence his performance in "Mysterious Skin". He made his screen debut appearing in the 1989 comedy-drama film "The Unbelievable Truth" written and directed by Hal Hartley. Sage later appeared in several more of Hartley's movies, such as "Trust" (1990), "Simple Men" (1992) and "Flirt" (1995), and other independent films.

Shirley Scott

Shirley Scott (March 14, 1934 – March 10, 2002) was an American jazz organist. Her music was noted for its mixture of bebop, blues, and gospel elements. She was known by the nickname "Queen of the Organ".
Life and career.
Scott was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father operated a jazz club in the basement of the family home and her brother played saxophone. At the age of eight, Scott began taking piano lessons. After enrolling at the Philadelphia High School for Girls, where she was awarded a scholarship, Scott switched to playing trumpet and performed in the all-city schools band.
She received bachelor and master's degrees at Cheyney University in Cheyney, west of Philadelphia. Later in life, Scott returned to the university as a teacher.
As a performer in the 1950s, she played the Hammond B-3 organ. Her recordings with Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis included the hit "In the Kitchen". Influenced by gospel and blues, she played soul jazz in the 1960s with Stanley Turrentine, who became her husband during the same decade; the couple divorced in 1971. Although organ trios declined in popularity during the 1970s, they resurged in the 1980s and she recorded again. In the 1990s, she recorded as pianist in a trio and performed at venues in Philadelphia.
As a band leader.
Scott's success in the industry led her to her own recording with "Prestige". Her first album as a bandleader was "Great Scott!", released in 1958. She performed with bassist George Duvivier and drummer Arthur Edghill, as the head of the trio. The album consisted of a mix of blues and soul tunes with covers such as of Cole Porter's "All of You", and Latin-influenced tunes and up-tempo burners and ballads with songs such as "Brazil" and "Nothing Ever Changes My love For You". Other notable covers include Ray Noble's "Cherokee" and Miles Davis's "Four", and her own track "The Scott". Scott strategically chose to have a bassist in her recordings instead of a typical melodic instrument, to allow herself full freedom to explore the organ. Laying a bass foundation allowed her to stand out with the solo and melodic sections as an organist.
Despite Scott's undeniable talent and strategic performance as a musician, she struggled to be taken seriously as a musician, especially in a male-dominated industry. In the linear notes for her original release, comments such as: "Shirley Scott is a girl. At the organ she does a man-sized job." However, Scott continued to thrive in her work and released a second album "Shirley's Sounds" soon after and small group albums such as 1959's "Soul Searching" and 1960's "Soul Sister". Across her lifetime, she led multiple small group line-ups showcasing her passion for music.
As an educator and entrepreneur.
Scott took an interest in the business and academia side of jazz, as she taught jazz history and piano at Cheyney University, Pennsylvania, also receiving a bachelor of arts (B.A.) and a master of arts (M.A.) degree. She also received two Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts that helped further her academic career. In 1992–1993, she also appeared on the television show "You Bet Your Life". She was recruited as a musical director by Bill Cosby, who had first heard her in clubs in the 1950s. She also spent her time as a church choir director.
Personal life.
Shirley Scott was married to Davis for a number of years, contributing to significant collaborations in music (cite). After her fallout with Davis in 1960, she married the well-known saxophonist Stanley Turrentine, whom she met on a gig in Panama. They married in 1961 and collaborated on many records including "Common Touch", and "Girl Talk". After her second marriage, Scott continued to tour and recorded over 50 albums. Additionally, Scott had five children, two sons from her first marriage and three daughters from her second marriage.
Instrument and style.
Scott was a master of the Hammond B3 organ and was well known for her skillful playing and melodic tunes. However, she did not always start out as a professional organist. Born into a musical family, she was bound to play an instrument. At a young age she played the piano and later played the trumpets during high school. She was skilled in piano and in the mid 1950s she would play piano with John Coltrane at Philadelphia's nightclub. One day a club owner needed her to fill in the role of an organist and Scott took the role, crafting her signature sound almost immediately. In 1955, she switched over to the organ and collaborated with Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis, gaining national recognition. One of her first known hits into the jazz charts was for the "Cookbook" album with saxophonist Eddie Davis. She emphasized feeling inspired by Eddie Davis and Jimmy Smith. She stated: "Davis and Smith were truly the first two organists who inspired me to pick up the instrument" Amorosi. 
Scott brought a fresh new perspective and feel to the B-3’s sounds, making it sound "less heavy" and more "heavenly" and "light touch" (cite). Scott's playing demonstrated a combination of highly rhythmic bebop harmonies and lyrical touch to the B-3 sounds. However, her "deeply-felt" understanding of the blues and gospel set her apart from other organ players as a remarkable organist. In her later albums under the Cadet label, including "Mystical Lady" (1971), "Lean on Me" (1972), and "Superstition" (1973) she explored different rhythms and applied funky jazz to pop and R&amp;B tracks. Scott’s style expresses her versatility as a musician and ability to challenge the status quo of jazz music.
Death.
Scott won an $8 million settlement in 2000 against American Home Products, the manufacturers of the diet drug fen-phen. She died of heart failure in 2002 at Presbyterian Hospital in Philadelphia.
Legacy.
Scott was a leading figure in the jazz movement for hard pop known as soul jazz. While artists such as Jimmy Smith or Jack McDuff may be more commonly known when discussing the Hammond B3 organ, Scott crafted her own interpretation and had a unique approach on the organ. In a mostly male-dominated industry Scott was not afraid to experiment with the instrument and helped bring a new sense of appreciation of the organ to the jazz world.

Royal Australian Navy Submarine Force

The Royal Australian Navy Submarine Force (SUBFOR) is the submarine element of the Royal Australian Navy. The service currently forms the Navy's Submarine Force Element Group (FEG) and consists of six "Collins" class submarines.
The Royal Australian Navy Submarine Force has been established four times, with the initial three attempts being foiled by combat losses and Australia's economic problems. The modern Submarine Force was established in 1964, and has formed an important element of the Australian military's capacity since that date. While the Submarine Force has not seen combat since World War I, Australian submarines have conducted extensive surveillance operations throughout South East Asia.
The current Director General Submarines is Commodore T. Phillips, RAN.
History.
The Royal Australian Navy's submarine component has been established four times since 1914.
1914–1945.
After the formation of the navy upon Federation, a period of uncertainty had followed as the size of the force to be established was determined. Eventually, this was set at 13 vessels, including three submarines. Initially, it had been intended to purchase three small submarines, but this order was later changed, and instead Australia's first submarines were the larger British E-class submarines and . These submarines were built in Britain and arrived in Australia in 1914. Following the outbreak of World War I, both boats took part in the occupation of Rabaul in German New Guinea in September 1914. During this operation, "AE1" disappeared on 14 September off Cape Gazelle, New Britain with the cause unknown. Its whereabouts was a mystery until it was located by searchers southeast of the Duke of York Islands on 20 December 2017.
"AE2" remained in the South Pacific until December 1914, when she was ordered to the Mediterranean to support the British-led operations off the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey. "AE2" was the first Empire submarine to penetrate the Dardanelles, achieving this task on 25 April 1915 (the day of the first landings at Gallipoli). "AE2" operated in the Sea of Marmora for five days and made four unsuccessful attacks on Turkish ships before being damaged by a Turkish gunboat and scuttled by her crew on 30 April. These attacks are the only occasions an Australian submarine has fired in anger.
The Australian submarine service was reformed in 1919, when the British government transferred six J-class submarines to Australia; HMA Submarines , , , , , and . These submarines arrived in Australia with their tender in April 1919 and were based at Osborne House, Geelong from early 1920. The boats were in poor mechanical condition, however, and spent most of their service in refit. Due to Australia's worsening economic situation, all of the boats were decommissioned in 1922, and were scuttled later in the decade.
The Australian submarine service was established a third time in 1927, when the British O-class submarines and were commissioned. These submarines sailed from Portsmouth for Sydney on 8 February 1928, but did not arrive in Australia until 14 February 1929; numerous mechanical problems delayed their delivery voyage. Due to Australia's poor economic situation, the O-class boats proved to be unaffordable and were placed in reserve in 1930, before transferring back to the Royal Navy in 1931. As a result, the Royal Australian Navy did not operate any submarines during World War II, though the obsolete Dutch submarine "K.IX" was commissioned as on 22 June 1943 and was used for anti-submarine warfare training purposes. Due to the boat's poor mechanical condition "K9" saw little service with the RAN and spent most of her time in commission under repair, before being decommissioned on 31 March 1944 due to a lack of spare parts.
The Australian ports of Fremantle and Brisbane were important bases for Allied submarines during World War II. A total of 122 United States Navy, 31 Royal Navy, and 11 Royal Netherlands Navy submarines conducted patrols from Australian bases between 1942 and 1945. Fremantle was the second largest Allied submarine base in the Pacific Theatre after Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
1945–present.
Following World War II the Royal Navy's 4th Submarine Flotilla was based in Sydney from 1949 until 1969. The flotilla, which varied in size between two and three boats, was used to support the Royal Australian Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy in anti-submarine warfare training, with the operating cost split between the two nations. In the early 1960s, the British Government advised the Australian Government that reductions in the Royal Navy conventional submarine force meant that the 4th Flotilla was to return to the United Kingdom. The impending withdrawal of the British submarine flotilla sparked the fourth attempt to establish an Australian submarine service. While the Department of Defence advised the government that three to six submarines should be purchased for training purposes, following the intervention of then-Senator John Gorton the Government instead approved the purchase of eight submarines to form a submarine strike force. Eight British s were ordered in 1964, to be built in Scotland in two batches of four boats. Only six boats were delivered; the seventh and eighth were cancelled in 1971 to fund the acquisition of ten A-4 Skyhawk aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm. The final Royal Navy submarine to be based in Australia, , was withdrawn in 1969.
The first Australian "Oberon"-class submarine, , was commissioned on 21 March 1967. She was followed by her sister ships; (1968), (1969), (1969), (1977), and (1978). "Orion" and "Otama" were more capable than the previous four boats, as they were fitted with advanced communications monitoring equipment. All of the "Oberon"-class submarines were based at , on Sydney Harbor. The "Oberon"s proved very successful and saw extensive service during the last decades of the Cold War. This service included conducting risky surveillance missions against India and Communist nations in South East Asia. These missions were cancelled in 1992 when an Australian submarine, believed to be "Otama", became tangled in fishing nets and was forced to surface in the South China Sea. The "Oberon" class regularly conducted exercises with the Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) and to a lesser extent the 1st Commando Regiment and the Clearance Diving Branch. In 1980, the SAS was tasked to develop a maritime counter terrorist capability together with the clearance divers and conducted the first ever swimmer release from a submerged Australian submarine. "Onslow" was fitted with a four-man diving chamber for exit and reentry of SAS swimmers. As part of the Government's Two Ocean Navy policy submarines were homeported at in Western Australia from 1987 and the headquarters of the Australian Submarine Squadron moved to HMAS "Stirling" in 1994. The "Oberon" class boats were gradually decommissioned and replaced with new s during the 1990s. The final "Oberon"-class boat, HMAS " Otama", was decommissioned on 15 December 2000.
The six "Collins"-class submarines were the first Australian-built submarines, and the most expensive ships to have been built in Australia. The "Collins"-class submarines were built by the Australian Submarine Corporation at Adelaide, South Australia and entered service between 1996 and 2003 following extensive trials and modifications to the early boats in the class. The dedicated trials and submarine rescue ship supported these trials between 1992 and 1998. Tests conducted on after she was provisionally commissioned in 1996 revealed serious shortcomings in the submarine's performance, including excessive hull noise and an ineffective combat system. These problems were subsequently rectified. The second boat commissioned was (1998) followed by (1999), (2001), (2001) and (2003). The "Collins"-class submarines currently rank among the most effective conventional submarines in the world.
Like the "Oberon" class, the "Collins"-class submarines have conducted surveillance patrols. In 1999, it was reported that "Waller" and a second boat operated in support of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) providing escorts for transport ships, monitoring Indonesian communications, inserting special forces and had been collecting intelligence on East Timor for months. Two boats, "Collins" and "Dechaineux", received the special forces upgrade providing the capability while submerged to release several swimmers and for their reentry, filling a capability gap the former "Oberon"-class boat "Onslow" had provided. While the "Collins"-class submarines' performance has improved over time, their maximum diving depth was permanently reduced following the near-loss of "Dechaineux" when a pipe burst during a practice dive in February 2003.
In 1998 the Royal Australian Navy became the fourth Navy in the world to permit women to serve on board submarines. The first female submariners began their training at the Submarine Training and Systems Centre in June 1998.
Sometime in 2024 or early 2025, the Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service officially rebranded as the Submarine Force (SUBFOR).
Today.
The Royal Australian Navy Submarine Force Element Group Headquarters, and all six of the "Collins"-class submarines, are at HMAS "Stirling" located on Garden Island, near Perth. The majority of the Navy's submarine support facilities are also located at HMAS "Stirling", including the Submarine Escape Training Facility. The LR5 submersible, which is contracted to provide the RAN's submarine rescue capability, has been based at nearby Henderson, Western Australia since June 2009.
Under current Royal Australian Navy doctrine, the Submarine Force has the following responsibilities:
In early 2007 it was reported that Submarine Force was experiencing severe shortfalls in personnel and had only 70% of its authorised strength of 500 sailors. These shortfalls were reported to have reduced the force's operational readiness and forced HMAS "Collins" to be temporarily withdrawn from service.
Future submarines.
The "Collins"-class submarines will begin to reach the end of their useful life from 2026. To meet the in-service date of 2026, advanced design work on the next generation of Australian submarines began in 2014. At this very early stage, it appeared that the submarines would be Australian-built conventional submarines equipped with air independent propulsion and advanced combat and communications systems. 
In September 2013 Rear Admiral Greg Sammut was appointed as Head Future Submarine Program.
In 2016 France won a contract to build a conventionally powered variant of its for Australia.
In September 2021 the Australian government announced that the deal with France had been scrapped, and that Australia would be working with the United States and United Kingdom to acquire at least eight conventionally-armed nuclear powered submarines as part of the new AUKUS security partnership.
Three prototype autonomous underwater vehicles were ordered for the RAN in May 2022, designated the Ghost Shark. The first prototype was publicly revealed in April 2024.
Dolphin badge.
Australian sailors who qualify as submariners are awarded a badge depicting two dolphins and a crown. This badge (known as a sailor's 'dolphins') was designed by Commander Alan McIntosh RAN, and was introduced in 1966; a similar badge was adopted by the Royal Navy Submarine Service in 1972.

Moscow Military District

The Order of Lenin Moscow Military District () is a military district of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Originally it was a district of the Imperial Russian Army until the Russian Empire's collapse in 1917. It was then part of the Soviet Armed Forces. The district was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1968. In 2010, it was merged with the Leningrad Military District to form the new Western Military District. In December 2022, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu proposed to reestablish it along with the Leningrad Military District, a decision confirmed in June 2023 by Deputy Chief of the General Staff Yevgeny Burdinsky. The district was formally reconstituted on 26 February 2024 by a Presidential Decree №141, after the Western Military District was split.
Colonel General Sergey Kuzovlev took over as the new district's commander on 15 May 2024. The Moscow Military District is one of the smallest military districts in Russia by geographic size. It is one of two military districts of the Russian Armed Forces, with its jurisdiction primarily within the western central region of European Russia. The Moscow Military District contains 20 federal subjects of Russia: Belgorod Oblast, Bryansk Oblast, Ivanovo Oblast, Kaluga Oblast, Kostroma Oblast, Kursk Oblast, Lipetsk Oblast, Moscow, Moscow Oblast, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Oryol Oblast, Ryazan Oblast, Smolensk Oblast, Tambov Oblast, Tver Oblast, Tula Oblast, Vladimir Oblast, Vologda Oblast, Voronezh Oblast, Yaroslavl Oblast. It lies in the Central Federal District.
Military units of the internal troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the FSB Border Service of Russia, as well as units of the Ministry of Emergency Situations and other ministries and departments of the Russian Federation performing tasks on the territory of the district are under its operational subordination.
History.
Russian Empire (1864–1917).
In the beginning of the second half of the 19th century Russian officials realized the need for re-organization of the Imperial Russian Army to meet new circumstances. During May 1862, the War Ministry, headed by Army General Dmitry Milyutin, introduced to Tsar Alexander II of Russia proposals for the reorganization of the army, which included the formation of fifteen military districts. A tsarist edict of 6 August 1864, announced in a Defence Minister’s order on 10 August of the same year, established ten military districts, including Moscow. The District’s territory then comprised 12 provinces: Vladimir, Vologda, Kaluga, Kostroma, Moscow, Nizhniy Novgorod, Ryazan, Smolensk, Tambov, Tver, Tula, and Yaroslavl. The District was intended as a reinforcement source for troops and equipment, being some distance from the frontier, rather than an operational area.
The District dispatched five infantry and a cavalry division south to the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–8, as well as sending another division to the Caucasus area. This force totaled around 30,000 men and 20,000 horses. Over 80,000 men were also called into reserve units. The District also housed 21,000 Turkish prisoners of war. During the First World War over a million men were stationed in the district. Much of the garrison was involved in the October Revolution of 1917, and consequent establishment of a Soviet regime in the cities of Bryansk, Vladimir, Voronezh, Kaluga, Nizhniy Novgorod, Orel, Tver, Yaroslavl. By a resolution of the Moscow Military Revolutionary Committee on , Corps Commander N.I. Muralov was assigned as the new commander of the district.
Soviet Russia &amp; Soviet Union (1917–1991).
In the period of the Russian Civil War and military intervention in Russia 1917 - 22 the District prepared military personnel for all the fronts and supplied the Red Army with different forms of armament and allowances. From June to the middle of September 1919 the District conducted 33 callups totalling more than 500,000 people. In Moscow the 1 Moscow Rifle Division, Warsaw revolutionary infantry regiment, and 2nd revolutionary infantry regiment were formed, and Latvian forces were brought to the Latvian Rifles Division. In Voronezh two cavalry divisions were formed, two rifle divisions and two rifle regiments in Nizhniy Novgorod, and the 16th Rifle Division in Tambov. Artillery units too were also being raised in the capital area.
After the end of Civil War in the troops of region were demobilized, as a result of which their number was reduced from 580,000 (at the end of 1920) to 85,000 in January 1923, and the District was reorganised on a peacetime basis. In the 1920s the District had 10 rifle divisions: the 1st Moscow Proletariat Red Banner Rifle Division (first formed either in December 1924 or at the beginning of 1927), the 6th Oryol; the 14th Vladimir; the 17th Nikhegorodskaya; the 18th Yaroslavskaya; the 19th Voronekhskaya; the 48th Tverskaya; the 55th Kurskaya; the 81st Kaluga; and the 84th Tula. Autumn maneuvers began to be conducted yearly here in the district. The 2nd Rifle Corps was stationed in the district from 1922 to 1936. In the beginning of the 1930 tanks started to be introduced, including the MS or T-18, T-26, T-27, BT, T-28, and the heavy T-35. In 1930 the first mechanized infantry brigade in the Soviet Army was formed in the district.
The Russian Ground Forces' official site notes that the first tactical parachute landing took place in the District on 2 August 1930.
In World War II the District formed three fronts, 23 armies, 128 divisions of all arms, and 197 brigades of all arms, an approximate total of 4.5 million men. In 1944–5 alone the District sent to the front 1,200,000 soldiers. From summer 1945 to summer 1946, in order to supervise the demobilisation process, the District was subdivided into four: the Moscow, Voronezh (1949–60), Gorki (1945—1947, 1949—1953) (where the 324th Rifle Division was probably demobilised), and Smolensk Military Districts (33rd Army, home from Germany, formed Smolensk MD headquarters in late 1945). General Kirill Moskalenko took command of the District in 1953 and would later be a Marshal of the Soviet Union after leaving his post.
The Voronezh Military District was reactivated in 1949 and was active until 1960.
In January 1954 the district's forces comprised the 1st Guards Rifle Corps (including the 62nd Guards Mechanised Division and the 60th Rifle Division); the 11th Guards Rifle Corps (272nd Rifle Division and 23rd Guards Mechanized Division), the 13th Guards Rifle Corps (38th Guards Rifle Division and the 66th Guards Mechanised Division), 38th Guards Airborne Corps (13th Guards, 105th Guards Vienna Airborne Division and 106th Airborne Division) and the 4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division. Among the 1957 reorganisations was the creation of the 23rd Guards Motor Rifle Division from the 23rd Guards Mechanized Division.
On 22 February 1968, for the large contribution to the cause of strengthening the defense of the state, for its successes in combat and political training, and in view of the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Army plus its important role in the 2nd World War, the District was awarded with the Order of Lenin.
In 1979 Scott and Scott reported the HQ address as being Moscow, A-252, Chapayevskiy Per., Dom 14.
Post-Soviet era (1991–2010).
With the collapse of the USSR the District became for the first time in its history a boundary district and thus a new priority was put on building up combat forces within it, rather than the training and capital garrison focus of the Soviet period.
In the early 1990s the District received the headquarters of the First Guards Tank Army from the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. It was relocated to Smolensk, and consisted of the 4th Guards Tank Division and 144th Guards Motor Rifle Division (at Yelnya). In July 1992 the 336th Independent Helicopter Regiment returned from Germany to Oreshkovo airfield and was placed under the Moscow Military District. The regiment then came under 1st Guards Tank Army from 31 December 1992. The 1st Guards Tank Army's headquarters disbanded later in the 1990s, along with the 144th Guards MRD. In addition, the 6th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade was withdrawn from Germany and restationed at Kursk.
The 22nd Army Headquarters was reformed from 13th Army Corps in the early 1990s, to control the new 3rd Motor Rifle Division among other formations. The 22nd Army had previously been inactive for a long period; it was last operational immediately after the war (when it participated in the Second Rzhev-Sychevka Offensive in late 1942) when its HQ along with the 109th Rifle Division arrived in the South Ukraine in May 1945. In the Northern summer of 1945, together with the headquarters of the Separate Coastal Army, located in the Crimea, it was reorganised as the new but short-lived Tavria Military District.
On 1 June 1997 the 59th Guards Motor Rifle Division in Transdnestr, Moldova, was reorganised as the 8th Guards Independent Motor-Rifle Brigade with four motor-rifle battalions, one tank battalion, two artillery battalions, and an anti-tank battalion plus other combat support and support units. After several years reporting directly to the General Staff, the Operational Group of Russian Forces in Moldova was realigned under the command of the Moscow Military District in 1998. Previously the 14th Guards Army (it was renamed in April 1995), forces and individuals from this command played a major part in the early 1990s in establishing and maintaining the Transnistrian separatists of the Transnistria as a viable "de facto" state.
In 1994 the 16th Air Army took over most air forces from the Air Forces of the Moscow Military District. In 2010, the district was merged with the Leningrad Military District to form the new Western Military District.
Recreation (2024–present).
On 21 December 2022, citing the influx of conscripts from the 2022 Russian mobilization, Russian Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu announced that the Moscow Military District was being re-established, alongside the Leningrad Military District. On 20 March 2024, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced formation of the new 69th Motor Rifle Division and renewed 34th Guards Artillery Division as part of the Moscow Military District.

In addition to the ground forces divisions directly subordinated to the district HQ, the Moscow MD had the 13th Guards Army Corps as its main ground forces formation:

In the last days of the Soviet Union there was a considerable Soviet Air Defence Forces presence, and a smaller Air Forces presence, in the Moscow Military District. The Air Forces of the Moscow Military District consisted of a reconnaissance regiment, the 47th Guards Separate Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment at Shatalovo flying Su-24MPs, and the 9th Fighter Aviation Division (9 iad), at Kubinka, with three regiments. The division incorporated the 32nd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, also at Shatalovo, with MiG-23MLDs, the 234th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment at Kubinka with MiG-29s, and the 274th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment at Migalovo (274 apib) with Su-17s. Also part of the force was a ground signals regiment, the 131st.
There was also a transport squadron, an independent helicopter regiment, and an independent helicopter squadron for electronic warfare.
32nd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment served in Cuba as part of 'Operation Anadyr' during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1963. The regiment was temporarily renamed 213th Fighter Aviation Regiment while in Cuba. It was disbanded in 1989.
In October 1990 the 1080th Red Banner Training Aviation Center for retraining of personnel im. V.P. Chkalov was activated in Borisoglebsk, Voronezh Oblast, from the 796th Center for Preparation of Officers for Fighter and Fighter-Bomber Aviation, and the Borisoglebsk Higher Military Aviation School of Pilots. It came under the command of the Air Forces of the Moscow Military District. It comprised four instructor aviation regiments, the fourth being the 343rd Fighter Aviation Regiment at Sennoy with MiG-29s.
Joseph Stalin's son Vasily Stalin commanded the Moscow district air forces from June 1948 to August 1952. He was succeeded by General Colonel Stepan Krasovsky (1952–53), Lieutenant General Stepan Rybanov (June 1953 – 1959), and, later, Lieutenant General Igor Dmitriev () (1983–1989) and Nikolai Antoshkin () (1989–93).
Also part of the Moscow District air forces was the 4th Centre for Combat Employment and Retraining of Personnel at Lipetsk.
Air Forces of the Moscow Military District ("ВВС Московского военного округа")(formerly the 78th Air Army)
Command and Headquarters ("Командование и штаб ВВС МВО") - Moscow, RSFSR
In addition the following formations, units and establishments were based within the Moscow Military District, but were outside the control of the district's Air Forces:
"Order of Lenin" Moscow Air Defence District.
Unlike the Air Forces of the Moscow Military District, which were part of the district, the units and formations of the Air Defence Forces were kept separate, reporting to their own Main Staff. The Moscow MD came under the air defence umbrella of the Moscow Air Defence District ("Московский ордена Ленина округа ПВО"), which was the sole such district within the ADF.
Post-Cold war.
Order of battle c. 2006.
The District had around 75,000 troops assigned and consisted of the following formations. The entire Ground Forces began to go through a major reorganisation (the 2008 Russian military reform), which apparently began in March 2009, in which armies become operational commands and divisions were redesignated brigades.
In addition to normal units, the district was home at least until 2001 to the 11th Separate Cavalry Regiment (), a unit used for producing war films. The unit was based at Kobyakovo.
"Order of Lenin" Moscow Military District 2010.
Formations of the Airborne Forces, including the 98th Guards Airborne Division and 106th Guards Airborne Division "Tula", also are based within the District's boundaries, but report directly to VDV headquarters.
Army General Vladimir Bakin was the former chief of staff – first deputy commander-in-chief of forces of the Volga-Ural Military District.

San Simeon (horse)

San Simeon is a Standardbred pacer from Western Australia best known for his Australasian record winning sequence of 29 races from his first start as a two-year-old until his defeat by Michael Frost during the 1981 Interdominion series in Hobart, Tasmania. He also won three consecutive Australian Harness Horse of the Year awards.
Racing career.
San Simeon began his racing career on 11 November 1978 at Bunbury, 175 kilometres south of Perth. He immediately began his 29 race winning sequence by winning all 10 starts as a two-year-old including the WA Golden Slipper and WA Champagne Stakes. He was voted Australian two-year-old (2yo) of the year for 1978/9, and the $50,162 he earned that season was a new Australian record for a horse of his age.
As a three-year-old San Simeon raced only six times but recorded a win at each start. He defeated Victorian visitor Gammalite in the Western Australian Derby and then beat him comfortably in the Australian Derby. Both races were held at Gloucester Park in Perth. San Simeon was voted Australian 3yo of the year and his record now stood at 16 wins from 16 starts.
San Simeon began the 1980/1 season with a win at Harvey on 13 September. On 5 December 1980 he equalled the Australasian record winning streak of 24 wins held by Maori's Idol and Lucky Creed by winning at Fremantle. He then set a new record of 25 wins on 12 December by winning the WA 4yo Classic. San Simeon then raced against the top open class horses for the first time in the Western Australian Pacing Cup series. As a relatively inexperienced four-year-old he was well handicapped with established stars Koala King and Satinover giving him starts of 20 metres and 15m respectively. After winning both his heats he won the final on 2 January 1981 defeating King Carramar and Local Mark.
The Inter Dominion was held in Hobart for the first time and the relatively small circumference of the showgrounds circuit and handicap conditions may have contributed to the non-appearance of Satinover, Locarno, Delightful Lady and Gammalite and the poor performances by New Zealand trained horses during the series. Koala King, the previous winner, was injured. San Simeon won the slowest of three one mile heats on the first night to extend his sequence to 29 but the record went no further after he was defeated by Michael Frost on night two. "Very, very relieved" said trainer-driver Lou Austin regarding the defeat. After a third night win he was much too good for Single Again and Ardstraw in the final winning by 10 metres in track record time. Veteran Pure Steel, competing in an Interdominion for the fifth time, finished fourth after conceding the winner 15m under the handicap conditions. He was voted Australian Harness Horse of the Year for season 1980/1 and was also Australian Grand Circuit Champion.
Following the Interdominion win San Simeon was invited to take part in a World Cup series at The Meadowlands in the United States during 1982. He won two races at Gloucester Park later in 1981 before heading overseas. In America San Simeon failed to win in three starts and returned home to Western Australia. He made two further starts in 1983 without winning and was retired to stud. During his career he also won the WA 4&amp;5yo Championship twice and the 2yo leg of the WA Triple Crown.

Madhu Koda

Madhu Koda (born 6 January 1971) is an Indian politician who had served as the Chief Minister of Jharkhand from 2006 to 2008 (UPA alliance). He 
was sworn in as the fifth Chief Minister of Jharkhand on 18 September 2006, and remained in office until he resigned on 27 August 2008.
Koda is the third independent legislator to assume the office of chief minister of an Indian state, including Bishwanath Das in Orissa in 1971 and Flinder Anderson Khonglam in Meghalaya in 2002.
His wife Geeta Koda, MP from West Singhbhum district is among the six MLAs representing smaller regional parties led by Hemant Soren formed on 13 July 2013. In December 2017, he was convicted by a court of law and sentenced to three-years in jail and fined .
Personal life.
Madhu Koda was born in Vill. Gua, District. West Singhbhum in Jharkhand. An ethnic Ho, his father is Rasika Koda, a tribal farmer, who lives in Vill. Pathhatu in District. Singhbhum. He is a graduate from IGNOU centre, Bhubneshwar. His father wanted Madhu to have a "normal life" and remain a farmer or iron worker, but after experiencing corruption in the iron industry, he eventually began a career in politics.
Koda is married to Geeta Koda, who is an MLA from his previous constituency Jaganathpur from the Jai Bharat Samanta Party. They have two daughters.
Political career.
Madhu Koda began his political career as an activist with the All Jharkhand Students Union. He won in the 2000 Bihar Assembly elections from Jaganathpur as a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate. On 15 November 2000 the state of Jharkhand was carved out from the southern part of Bihar. Koda's constituency Jaganathpur was included in Jharkhand and he became a member of the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly. Babulal Marandi of BJP became the first CM of Jharkhand on 15 November 2000.
In this government, Madhu became the Minister of State, Rural Engineering Organisation (Ind. Charge). But there was revolt against Marandi by rebels and he finally resigned. Arjun Munda took over and became the CM on 18 March 2003 and in this government Koda became the minister of Panchayati Raj of Special Arrangement.
During the 2005 Assembly Elections in Jharkhand, the BJP denied Koda a ticket. He contested as an Independent candidate and won from Jaganathpur once again, defeating his nearest rival from the Indian National Congress by over ten thousand votes. Koda extended his support to the BJP-led NDA.
On 2 March 2005, after much political bargaining and quid pro quo Shibu Soren of Congress-JMM alliance was invited to form the government in Jharkhand by the Governor of Jharkhand, Syed Sibtey Razi.
He resigned as Chief Minister nine days later, on 11 March, following his failure to obtain a vote of confidence in the assembly. Then Arjun Munda of BJP-led NDA became the CM, whom Koda supported and he was appointed the Minister of Mining Geology and Cooperative.
In September 2006, Madhu and three other independent legislators withdrew support to the Munda government, bringing it into the minority and led to resignation of Munda The United Progressive Alliance decided on him as consensus candidate to become Chief Minister and Koda became the next CM of Jharkhand on 14 September 2006.
His government included the representatives of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Jaua Manjhi group, Nationalist Congress Party, All India Forward Bloc, three independent MLAs (besides himself), and the outside support of the Indian National Congress. On 12 August 2008 Shibu Soren again staked claim for the post of CM and wanted Koda to resign. On 17 August 2008 JMM withdrew support from the Koda government, and Koda resigned on 23 August 2008 from the post of CM of Jharkhand. Koda became the UPA in charge of Jharkhand state. Shibu Soren again became the CM of Jharkhand on 27 August 2008.
But Soren suffered a humiliating defeat in the assembly bypoll on 8 January 2009 from Tamar constituency and failed to enter the Jharkhand assembly. He was defeated by Gopal Krishna Patar of Jharkhand Party, now a MLA from JD(U) – a constituent of NDA – by a margin of 9,062 votes. Soren resigned on 12 January 2009 and after this President's rule was imposed in Jharkhand on 19 January 2009 and till 29 December 2009. Koda then won the MP seat from Singhbhum parliamentary constituency again as an independent candidate, the results of which were declared on 16 May 2009.
In the next assembly elections of Jharkhand held 25 November 2009, his wife Geeta Koda won from his constituency Jaganathpur from Jai Bharat Samanta Party, the results of which were declared on 23 December 2009. In 2014 Jharkhand Assembly Election, Madhu Koda lost from the Majhgao constituency. Koda was defeated by Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) candidate Nial Purty by over 20,000 votes.
Mining scam conviction.
It was alleged that Madhu Koda was involved in a mining scam that occurred in Jharkhand in India. It was alleged by investigative agencies that Madhu Koda took huge bribes for illegally allotting iron ore and coal mining contracts in Jharkhand when he was the chief minister of the state. As per estimates, Koda and his associates collected over by allotting mines to business houses. On orders of Jharkhand High Court CBI is investigating the scam.
Koda was arrested by state police's vigilance wing on 30 November 2009 in connection with the mining scam. On 31 July 2013, he was released on bail from Birsa Munda Prison in Ranchi.
A special money-laundering court in Delhi attached Koda's properties worth in a disproportionate assets case against his alleged associates. It found that the properties were involved in the offence of laundering under the provisions of The Prevention Of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in a case probed by Enforcement Directorate (ED). Some of the attached assets also belonged to Anil Adinath Bastawde, who was arrested by the ED in January 2013 from Jakarta and Manoj B Punamiya, an associate of Koda and an accused in the case. ED sources had said the amount of scam, which had allegedly taken place during Koda's regime between 2006 and 2008 had gone up to in the course of investigation and the amount excluded Bastawde's assets, who was an absconder for a long time. In December 2017, the court of justice Bharat Parashar convicted Madhu Koda and awarded him a three-year jail term and imposed a fine of .

Confederate Monument of Bardstown

The Confederate Monument of Bardstown, in Bardstown, Kentucky was erected in 1903 in the Bardstown St. Joseph's Cemetery to honor the sacrifice of 67 Confederate States Army soldiers, who died during the American Civil War. Some 17 of the soldiers are still unknown.
History.
Most of the soldiers were under the command of Major General Braxton Bragg who died in 1862 in conflicts around Bardstown.
The monument was dedicated by the J. Crepps Wickliffe Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The base is made of limestone, and the statue of the Confederate soldier was made of zinc. A relief portrait of General Robert E. Lee is located directly beneath the statue.
The inscription reads:
 THIS MONUMENT
 IS ERECTED
 TO THE MEMORY OF
 THE 67 BRAVE MEN
 BURIED HERE, WHO
 LOST THEIR LIVES IN
 THE SERVICE OF THE
 CONFEDERATE
 GOVERNMENT.
 ___________ 
 "LORD GOD OF HOSTS BE

 NAMELESS THEY REST IN THE QUIET EARTH.
 WE CARE NOT WHENCE THEY CAME,
 DEAR IN THEIR LIFELESS CLAY;
 WHETHER UNKNOWN OR KNOWN TO FAME,
 THEIR CAUSE AND COUNTRY STILL THE SAME,
 THEY DIED AND WORE THE GRAY.
It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 17, 1997, one of sixty monuments to the American Civil War in Kentucky so honored on the same day. Starting in early autumn of 1999 the Sons of Confederate Veterans endeavored to restore and erect the individual gravemarkers.

William Wade (journalist)

William Warren Wade (1918 in Manhattan, New York – March 24, 2006 in Oakland, California) was an American war correspondent during World War II. He was a member of an eight-man team of journalists who flew bombing missions over Germany with the U.S. Air Force while he was working for the International News Service.
Early life.
Wade was born in Manhattan, son of a printer. At an early age he took an interest in the news. He took a newspaper delivery job as a young boy and by the time he was 16 he wrote unpaid articles for the Bergen County, New Jersey newspaper covering sports. He attended journalism school at the University of Minnesota. He worked as the copy desk chief at the "Minnesota Daily" from 1936-1939. After Wade graduated from college in 1939, he went to work for the Hearst News Service in New York and later in Chicago. In 1941 he landed a job at the International News Service (INS) in London and was immediately assigned to Iceland for nine months.
The Writing 69th.
Wade, along with seven other reporters, trained with and planned on flying bombing missions with the Eighth Air Force. That, however, was not necessarily in the cards. The Writing 69th trained with the Air Force for a week before the first mission, learning skills such as parachuting, adjustment to high-altitudes and weapons. The day of the first mission Feb. 26, 1943 was overcast over the primary target, thus the bombing group, composed of B-24s and B-17s diverted to a secondary target. It was no matter to Wade. He never saw either target.
Each of the six journalists (two reporters didn't fly that day) who flew the mission that day were on different planes. Wade's plane developed engine trouble and had to turn back. He later filed a story with his college-town Minnesota newspaper headlined "This local boy didn't make good." Later Wade missed a chance to fly a mission with the RAF when he lost a coin toss with fellow INS reporter Lowell Bennett. Bennett's plane was shot down and he was held prisoner in a German POW camp for 18 months. Eventually, Wade would fly a mission on D-Day on a B-26.
The Writing 69th never got a chance to fulfill their destiny as flying war correspondents. On the first mission New York Times correspondent Robert Post was killed in action when the plane he was on was shot down over Germany. The tragedy effectively ended the days of The Writing 69th.
After the war.
After the war ended Wade went on to earn a degree from the London School of Economics. He worked as an editor, writer and on-air talent for Voice of America beginning in 1955. In 1963 he became Voice of America's European bureau chief in Munich. He later worked for a decade as the chief for Voice of America's West European bureau in London. During this time he covered a lot of world financial and economic news and later wrote a book on the topic. Wade retired from Voice of America in 1984 and in 1994 moved to Oakland, California to be closer to his family.
Wade was married to Margaret Wade for 58 years before she died in October 2005. He had two daughters, Margaret and Christine.

M7 (perfume)

M7 is a men's fragrance by Yves Saint Laurent launched in 2002 (discontinued). It was created by the perfumers Alberto Morillas and Jacques Cavallier. It is the first male scent from YSL since Tom Ford took creative control. The fragrance "M7 Oud Absolu" (2011) is somewhat different. 
The name might refer to the fact that the M7 was the seventh fragrance for men created by/for YSL.
Brazilian perfume company Natura has recently launched a very similar fragrance called OUD Essencial which is undoubtedly a copy of M7.

Occhi di ragazza

"Occhi di ragazza" ("Girl's eyes") was the entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1970, performed in Italian by Gianni Morandi.
Background.
The ballad was initially chosen by singer Ron to be presented at the 1970 Sanremo Music Festival, but was rejected by the Selection Jury. Morandi then to led it to success, and the song became a staple of his live repertoire. The song was also important for Lucio Dalla, who had composed the song's music, as its success gave him visibility and propelled his career.
At Eurovision.
The song was performed third on the night, following 's Henri Dès with "Retour" and preceding 's Eva Sršen with "Pridi, dala ti bom cvet". At the close of voting, it had received 5 points, placing it 8th in a field of 12.
It was succeeded as Italian representative at the 1971 contest by Massimo Ranieri with "L'amore è un attimo".
Cover versions.
Cover versions of the song include those by Lucio Dalla, Ron and Ornella Vanoni. An English version of the song titled "Eyes of a Child" was recorded by the Italo-Australian performer Tony Pantano, while recorded a Swedish version of the song titled "Någonting att minnas".

Eight Songs for Greg Sage and the Wipers is a Wipers tribute album released on Tim/Kerr in 1992. The album was first released as a box set of 4 colored 7-inch records in a run of 10,000. It helped to raise the profile of the independent label.
Nirvana recorded their cover of "Return of the Rat" after Geffen had reservations about including the band's cover of "D-7". Hole recorded a cover of "Over the Edge".
"Fourteen Songs for Greg Sage and the Wipers" is the CD re-release of the album, expanded to include additional artist covers.
Critical reception.
"Phoenix New Times" praised "Up Front", calling it a "killer cut ... and a real firebomb of pure punk." "Vulture" listed "Return of the Rat" as Nirvana's 55th best song (out of 72), writing: "Furious and loose, this is an incredibly faithful take on Sage’s version with just a little bit of its desperate, quivering edge lost in the process."

<doc id="7027124" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7027124" title="Occludin">
Occludin

Occludin is a transmembrane protein that regulates the permeability of epithelial and endothelial barriers. It was first identified in epithelial cells as a 65 kDa integral plasma-membrane protein localized at the tight junctions. Together with Claudins, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin has been considered a staple of tight junctions, and although it was shown to regulate the formation, maintenance, and function of tight junctions, its precise mechanism of action remained elusive and most of its actions were initially attributed to conformational changes following selective phosphorylation, and its redox-sensitive dimerization. However, mounting evidence demonstrated that occludin is not only present in epithelial/endothelial cells, but is also expressed in large quantities in cells that do not have tight junctions but have very active metabolism: pericytes, neurons and astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages lymphocytes, and myocardium. Recent work, using molecular modeling, supported by biochemical and live-cell experiments in human cells demonstrated that occludin is a NADH oxidase that influences critical aspects of cell metabolism like glucose uptake, ATP production and gene expression. Furthermore, manipulation of occludin content in human cells is capable of influencing the expression of glucose transporters, and the activation of transcription factors like NFkB, and histone deacetylases like sirtuins, which proved capable of diminishing HIV replication rates in infected human macrophages under laboratory conditions.
Gene location.
In humans is encoded by the "OCLN" gene located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 at position q13.1. The canonical gene is 65,813 base pairs long, spanning base pairs 69,492,292 to 69,558,104. Its product is 522 amino acids long.
Protein structure.
Occludin's structure can be broken down into 9 domains. These domains are separated into two groups. 5 of the domains are located intracellularly and extracellularly. These 5 domains are separated by the 4 transmembrane domains of the protein. The nine domains are as follows: 
The C-terminus domain has been shown experimentally to be required for correct assembly of tight junction barrier function. The C-terminus also interacts with several cytoplasmic proteins of the junctional plaque and interacts with signaling molecules responsible for cell survival. The N-terminus of occludin experimentally has been linked to involvement in tight junction sealing/barrier properties. The extracellular loops are thought to be involved in the regulation of paracellualr permeability and the second extracellular has been shown to be involved in the localization of occludin at the tight junction.
Function.
Occludin is an important protein in tight junction function. Studies have shown that rather than being important in tight junction assembly, occludin is important in tight junction stability and barrier function. Indeed, MDCK cells lacking occludin and its homolog tricellulin exhibit less complex tight junction strand network and impaired barrier function. Furthermore, studies in which mice were deprived of occludin expression showed morphological stability in several epithelial tissues but also found chronic inflammation and hyperplasia in the gastric epithelium, calcification in the brain, testicular atrophy, loss of cytoplasmic granules in straited duct cells of salivary gland, and thinning of the compact bone. The phenotypical response of these mice to the lack of occludin suggest that the function of occludin is more complex than thought and requires more work.
Role in cancer.
Occludin plays a critical role in maintaining the barrier properties of a tight junction. Thus, mutation or absence of occludin increases epithelial leakiness which is an important barrier in preventing metastasis of cancer. Loss of occludin or abnormal expression of occludin has been shown to cause increased invasion, reduced adhesion and significantly reduced tight junction function in breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, patients with metastatic disease displayed significantly lower levels of occludin suggesting that the loss of occludin and thereby loss of tight junction integrity is important in metastatic development of breast cancer.
Occludin also plays an important role in the apoptosis. The C-terminus of occludin is important in receiving and transmitting cell survival signals. In standard cells, loss or disruption of occludin and other tight junction proteins leads to initiation of apoptosis through extrinsic pathways. Studies involving high levels of expression of occludin in cancer cells have shown that occludin mitigates several important cancer proliferation properties. The presence of occludin decreased cellular invasiveness and motility, enhanced cellular sensitivity to apoptogenic factors and lowered tumorigenesis and metastasis of the cancer cells. Specifically, occludin has a strong inhibitory effect on Raf1-induced tumorigenesis. Still, the exact mechanism of how occludin prevents the progression of cancer is not known but it has been shown that cancer progression is linked to the loss of occludin or the silencing of the OCLN gene.
Disease linkage.
Disruption of occludin regulation is an important aspect of a number of diseases. Strategies to prevent and/or reverse occludin downregulation may be an important therapeutic target. Mutation of occludin are thought to be a cause of band-like calcification with simple gyration and polymicrogyria (BLC-PMG). BLC-PMG is an autosomal recessive neurologic disorder.
Interactions.
Occludin has been shown to interact with Tight junction protein 2, YES1 and Tight junction protein 1 (ZO-1).

Sweet Emma Barrett

"Sweet Emma" Barrett (March 25, 1897, New Orleans, Louisiana – January 28, 1983) was an American self-taught jazz pianist and singer who worked with the Original Tuxedo Orchestra between 1923 and 1936, first under Papa Celestin, then William Ridgely. She also worked with Armand Piron, John Robichaux, Sidney Desvigne and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band.
Biography.
Born March 25, 1897, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Her father was Capt. William B. Barrett, who she said fought for the North in the Civil War. At age seven, she began to play the piano. In the early 1920s, Barrett joined Oscar Celestin's Original Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra. In 1928, when the Celestin's band split, she began intermittently playing music with Bebe Ridgeley's Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra, which continued for the next 10 years.
In 1947, she accepted a steady job at Happy Landing, a local club in Pecaniere, Louisiana, but it was her recording debut in 1961, with her own album in the Riverside Records "New Orleans: The Living Legends" series, that brought her recognition. Although most of the songs on the album were instrumentals, others featured vocals by Barrett that the liner notes described as her first recordings as a vocalist.
She was nicknamed "Bell Gal" because she wore a red skull cap and garters with Christmas bells that jingled in time with her music. She was featured on the cover of "Glamour" magazine, and written about in publications in the United States and Europe. She toured with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band domestically and internationally, including a stint at Disneyland in 1963.
Despite the popular exposure she received at concerts and overseas appearances, Barrett continued to feel most comfortable in her native New Orleans, especially the French Quarter.
In 1963, on her album "The Bell Gal and Her Dixieland Boys Music", Barrett sings on four of the eight songs and heads two overlapping groups. She is joined throughout by banjoist Emanuel Sayles, bassist Placide Adams, and drummer Paul Barbarin; and four songs feature trumpeter Alvin Alcorn, trombonist Jim Robinson and clarinetist Louis Cottrell Jr; the remaining four numbers have trumpeter Don Albert, trombonist Frog Joseph and clarinetist Raymond Burke. Overall, this set gives listeners a good sampling of the sound of New Orleans jazz circa 1963, and is one of the few recordings of Barrett mostly without the regular members of what would become the Preservation Hall Jazz Band (Robinson and Sayles excepted). The ensemble-oriented renditions of numbers such as "Big Butter and Egg Man", "Bogalusa Strut" and "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" are rendered with fun and joy.
The Preservation Hall Jazz Band made a brief appearance in the 1965 film "The Cincinnati Kid", which featured Barrett as vocalist and pianist for the band and included a close-up of her.
In 1967, she suffered a stroke that paralyzed her left side, but she continued to work, occasionally recording. She played music until her death in 1983 at age 85. She died at Metairie's Bonnabel Hospital. She was funeralized at St. Raymond Catholic Church in New Orleans.

Sir George Whitecross Paton (16 August 1902 – 16 June 1985) was an Australian legal scholar and Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University from 1951 until 1968.
Early life and education.

He married Alice Watson (1905–1994) on 11 July 1931 and they had four children.
Academic life.
Paton became a barrister-at-law in 1927 and lectured in law at the London School of Economics.

Oz (styled as OZ) is a Finnish heavy metal band, originally from Nakkila, Finland. It was formed in 1977, split in 1991 and re-established 2010.
Since 1983, OZ has been active mostly in Sweden as the band members moved to Stockholm after the release of their second album. In 2010, drummer Mark Ruffneck (born Pekka Mark), bassist and main songwriter Jay C. Blade (born Jukka Homi, but has changed his name to Jukka Lewis) and vocalist Ape De Martini (born Tapani Hämäläinen) re-formed the band, together with Costello Hautamäki and Markku Petander. As of 2016, OZ consists of four different members from Pori, Finland with Ruffneck being the original sole member.
They made a splash with their 1983 album "Fire in the Brain", a NWOBHM-flavored energetic metal affair that won over critics and fans alike. The subsequent albums, however, failed to elicit the same response, and the band faded from worldwide view. The band reformed in 2010 and released "Burning Leather" in 2011. The album "Transition State" was released on 20 October 2017 by AFM Records. The latest album, "Forced Commandments", was released in May 2020 by Massacre Records.

Roberto Mussi

Roberto Mussi (; born 25 August 1963) is an Italian former professional footballer, who played as a defender; a versatile player, he was capable of playing both as a centre-back or right-back. Due to his dynamism, tenacity, work-rate, and technique, he was capable of helping his team both offensively and defensively as a fullback on the flank. At international level, he represented Italy at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where they reached the final, and at UEFA Euro 1996. Following his retirement, he worked as a manager.
Club career.
Throughout his career, Mussi played for several Italian clubs. He made his professional debut with Massese (1981–84), and helped the team to gain promotion to Serie C2. He subsequently moved to Parma in 1984, where he enjoyed a successful spell under manager Arrigo Sacchi in Serie C1, helping the club to a Serie B promotion by winning the Serie C title.
In 1987, Sacchi purchased his former young fullback, making him part of his legendary Milan side. Mussi spent two seasons with the club (1987–89), winning an Italian Serie A title and a Supercoppa Italiana in 1988, as well as one European Cup (the predecessor to the UEFA Champions League) in 1989 with the club.
He subsequently moved to Serie B side Torino in 1989, helping the team to win the Serie B title that season, and to earn promotion to Serie A. The following season, he won the 1991 edition of the Mitropa Cup with Torino, and he helped his club to qualify for the UEFA Cup the next season by finishing the Serie A season in fifth place. During the 1991–92 season, Mussi led Torino to a third-place finish in Serie A, and he also helped his club to reach the UEFA Cup final, where they were defeated by Ajax on aggregate. During the 1992–93 season, Mussi won the Coppa Italia with Torino, but the team missed out on the 1993 Supercoppa Italiana.
In 1994, Mussi returned to Parma, where he enjoyed great success. In his second spell with the Emilian club, he won the UEFA Cup twice (in 1995 and 1999), and one Coppa Italia in 1999; he also reached the Coppa Italia final in 1995, and he managed a third-place finish in Serie A in 1995, a second-place league finish in 1997, and a fourth-place finish in 1999 with Parma. He retired from football in 1999, but he briefly returned to Massese, the club with which he had made his debut, during the 2010–11 season, in the lower divisions, although he failed to make an appearance for the club during the season. Overall, Mussi played 250 matches in Serie A throughout his career.
International career.
At international level, Mussi won 11 caps for the Italy national football team between 1993 and 1996 under manager Sacchi. He participated at the 1994 FIFA World Cup with Italy, where they reached the final, only to lose to Brazil on penalties. He made 3 appearances during the tournament, including one in the final defeat, picking up an injury during the match; he was replaced by Luigi Apolloni. He also notably set up Roberto Baggio's last minute equaliser against Nigeria in the round of 16, which enabled the Italians to win the match in extra-time with a Baggio penalty and advance to the quarter-finals. He also took part at Euro 1996, making 3 appearances as Italy were eliminated in the group stage.

Emperor Jiemin of Northern Wei

Emperor Jiemin of Northern Wei ((北)魏節閔帝) (498 – 21 June 532), also known as Emperor Qianfei (前廢帝), at times referred to by pre-ascension title Prince of Guangling (廣陵王), personal name Yuan Gong (元恭), courtesy name Xiuye (脩業), was an emperor of the Xianbei-led Northern Wei dynasty of China. He became emperor after the clan members of the paramount general Erzhu Rong, after Erzhu Rong was killed by Emperor Xiaozhuang, overthrew Emperor Xiaozhuang. Emperor Jiemin tried to revive order of the Northern Wei state, but with his power curbed by the Erzhus, was not able to accomplish much. After the general Gao Huan defeated the Erzhus in 532, Emperor Jiemin was imprisoned by Gao and subsequently poisoned to death by Emperor Xiaowu, whom Gao made emperor.
Background.
Yuan Gong was born in 498, during the reign of Emperor Xiaowen. His father was Yuan Yu (元羽) the Prince of Guangling, a son of Emperor Xianwen and a brother of Emperor Xiaowen. His mother was Yuan Yu's concubine Lady Wang. In 501, during the reign of Emperor Xiaowen's son Emperor Xuanwu, Yuan Yu died from injuries he suffered when he was attacked by his lover's husband, the low level official, Feng Junxing (馮俊興), and for reasons unclear, Yuan Gong inherited Yuan Yu's title even though he had one older brother, Yuan Xin (元欣), and neither he nor Yuan Xin was the son of Yuan Yu's wife Princess Zheng Shirong (郑始容). Yuan Gong also had one younger brother, Yuan Yongye (元永業).
Yuan Gong was described to be confident and strong-willed, and also filially pious toward his grandmother Princess Dowager Meng and his father's wife Princess Dowager Zheng (whom, under Confucian doctrines, he was required to treat her as a mother). During Yuan Cha's regency over Emperor Xuanwu's son Emperor Xiaoming (i.e., sometime between 520 and 525), Yuan Gong, because of Yuan Cha's corruption and violent tendencies, pretended to be ill and unable to speak, living in the Buddhist Longhua Temple (龍花寺). During the reign of his cousin Emperor Xiaozhuang, someone made a report to Emperor Xiaozhuang that Yuan Gong was only pretending to be unable to speak, and had treasonous intent. When Yuan Gong was informed of this, he, in fear, fled to Shangluo Mountain (上洛山, in modern Shangzhou, Shaanxi), but was captured and returned to Luoyang. Interrogations and investigations, however, yielded no proof that Yuan Gong plotted treason, so he was released.
In 530, Emperor Xiaozhuang, in fear that the paramount general Erzhu Rong would seize the throne, killed Erzhu Rong. Erzhu Rong's clan members rose and declared Erzhu Rong's wife Princess Beixiang's nephew Yuan Ye the Prince of Changguang emperor. Around the new year 531, Erzhu Rong's nephew Erzhu Zhao captured Luoyang and seized Emperor Xiaozhuang, subsequently killing him. Yuan Ye traveled toward Luoyang to take the throne. However, Erzhu Rong's cousin Erzhu Shilong was uncomfortable with Yuan Ye's lineage being distant from that of recent emperors, and wanted to find an emperor with closer imperial lineage. Erzhu Rong's nephew Erzhu Tianguang suggested Yuan Gong, and after Erzhu Shilong sent his brother Erzhu Yanbo (爾朱彥伯) to visit Yuan Gong to force him to accept and to ascertain that he was not truly unable to speak, Yuan Gong agreed, and Erzhu Shilong, when Yuan Ye arrived at Luoyang, forced him to yield the throne to Yuan Gong. Yuan Gong, after making three submissions to Yuan Ye declining the throne, took the throne as Emperor Jiemin.
Reign.
During Emperor Jiemin's reign, the Erzhu clan members controlled much of the functions of the central government, the provinces, and the military, with Erzhu Shilong controlling the central government, Erzhu Zhao controlling the northern provinces, Erzhu Tianguang controlling the western provinces, and Erzhu Zhongyuan (爾朱仲遠) controlling the southeastern provinces. Despite this, Emperor Jiemin himself tried to exert influences on policy in subtle ways, and at times he refused to following Erzhu Shilong's wishes. For example, when Erzhu Shilong had the official Xing Zicai (邢子才) author Emperor Jiemin's general pardon edict, describing the death of Erzhu Rong in detail as an extremely wrongful act by Emperor Xiaozhuang, Emperor Jiemin refused to promulgate the edict as written, but instead wrote a brief edict himself, using humble language and not getting into details. He also removed the character "huang" (皇) from his title, going from "huangdi" (皇帝) to just "di" (帝). He treated Yuan Ye with honor, creating him the Prince of Donghai. He also, in an unprecedented action, ordered that rival Liang Dynasty no longer be referred to as "false" (偽, "wei") Liang. (Traditionally, in Chinese history, the rival states referred to each other as "false.") He posthumously honored his father Yuan Yu as emperor, but only honored his mother Lady Wang as princess dowager, perhaps out of respect to Yuan Yu's wife Princess Zheng. He also created his brother Yuan Yongye the Prince of Gaomi and his son Yuan Shu (元恕) as Prince of Bohai.
The Erzhus, however, engaged in violence and corruption, and Emperor Jiemin was unable to curb them. As a result, in succession, the generals Liu Lingzhu (劉靈助) and Gao Huan rebelled. Liu was easily defeated, but Gao, with many disaffected generals joining him, proved to be a formidable opponent, and Gao, who initially acknowledged Emperor Jiemin's position as emperor, soon had another distant member of the imperial Yuan clan, Yuan Lang, declared emperor. In late 531, with the Erzhu clan in internal dissent from rumors that Gao spread, Gao defeated Erzhu Zhao and captured the important city Yecheng.
In spring 532, Erzhu Shilong, in order to end the dissension within the Erzhu clan, requested that Emperor Jiemin marry Erzhu Zhao's daughter as his empress. Soon, the Erzhu forces, commanded by Erzhu Zhao, Erzhu Tianguang, Erzhu Zhongyuan, and Erzhu Shilong's brother Erzhu Dulü (爾朱度律), converged at Yecheng to face Gao Huan, but despite their numerical advantage, Gao defeated them. Erzhu Zhao and Erzhu Zhongyuan fled back to their headquarters, while Erzhu Tianguang and Erzhu Dulü fled back toward Luoyang. At this time, the general Husi Chun rose against the Erzhus at Luoyang, and he killed Erzhu Shilong and Erzhu Yanbo, while capturing and delivering Erzhu Tianguang and Erzhu Dulü to Gao, who executed them.
After the defeat of the Erzhus.
Emperor Jiemin tried to take initiative by sending the official Lu Bian (盧辯) to greet Gao. Gao, who was then accompanying Yuan Lang and heading toward Luoyang, considered allowing Emperor Jiemin to keep the throne, as Yuan Lang's lineage was distant from recent emperors. He sent the general Wei Lan'gen (魏蘭根) to calm the imperial officials and to observe Emperor Jiemin. After Wei returned to Gao, Wei opined that Emperor Jiemin was intelligent and decisive and would be difficult to control in the future. Gao therefore arrested Emperor Jiemin and imprisoned him at Chongxun Temple (崇訓寺). Gao instead forced Yuan Lang to yield the throne to Yuan Xiu the Prince of Pingyang, and Yuan Xiu took the throne as Emperor Xiaowu.
During Emperor Jiemin's imprisonment at Chongxun Temple, he wrote a poem that is still extant:
About 10 days after Emperor Xiaowu took the throne, he sent messengers to poison Emperor Jiemin. He did not bury Emperor Jiemin with imperial honors, but did give him a burial that was greater than ordinary for imperial princes, and ordered the imperial officials to attend the funeral.

Santa Maria La Nova, Naples

Santa Maria la Nova is a Renaissance style, now-deconsecrated, Roman Catholic church and monastery in central Naples. The church is located at the beginning of a side street directly across from the east side of the main post office, a few blocks south of the Church and Monastery of Santa Chiara. Today the adjacent monastery is a meeting site and hosts the Museo ARCA of modern religious art.
History.
Since the early 13th century, a Franciscan monastery, named "Santa Maria ad Palatium" had existed nearby, but by 1268, was demolished in order for Charles of Anjou decided to build his Castel Nuovo (new castle), or Maschio Angioino. By 1279, the Friars were granted this site to build a new church, hence "la Nova". Initially constructed in Gothic style, the building was battered by Naple's frequent earthquakes but also suffered gravely from an explosion originating from Castel Sant'Elmo on December 13, 1587.
This last episode prompted reconstruction in 1596-1599, as announced in a cornice inscription, leading to the facade we see today, designed by Agnolo Franco Typical of Franciscan churches, the facade has a sober and simple restraint, accessed through a staircase and balustrade.
Interior.
The church nave ceiling is decorated with 46 gilt-framed "cassetone", or rectangular fresco panels, completed in 1598-1600. Among the contributing artists were Francesco Curia; Girolamo Imparato ("Assumption of the Virgin"); Fabrizio Santafede ("Coronation of the Virgin"); Giovanni Bernardino Azzolino; Belisario Corenzio ("Passion of Christ"); Luigi Rodriguez ("Prophets" and "Sybils"); Cesare Smet; and Tommaso Maurizio.

Suthep Wongkamhaeng

Suthep Wongkamhaeng (, 12 May 1934 – 27 February 2020) was a Thai singer, one of the most famous male singers of the "luk krung" genre of the 1950s. He made over 3,000 recordings over a career of forty years and was named National Artist in 1990. He also worked as a columnist and politician and briefly served in the Royal Thai Air Force, reaching the rank of pilot officer.
Born in Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Suthep trained as an artist but was soon introduced to the music industry; the hit song "Rak Khun Khao Laeo" brought him fame at the age of nineteen. Widely recognized for his smooth serenading voice, he has been described as "the Frank Sinatra of Thailand".
Early life and rise to fame.
Suthep Wongkamhaeng was born on 12 May 1934, in Sung Noen District of Nakhon Ratchasima Province. He lived in an extended family, his father having abandoned them before he was born. He attended school at Marie Vithaya, Wat Samo Rai, and Sikhiu Sawadphadungwitthaya schools in Nakhon Ratchasima, before undertaking vocational training in visual arts at the Poh Chang School of Arts in Bangkok, graduating in 1950.
Suthep worked as a sign painter for about two years after graduating, until a friend invited him to voice act in a radio play he was writing. He was then introduced to composer/songwriter , and subsequently left the painting job to become Salai's apprentice. He began singing during play interludes, and became acquainted to several composers and songwriters, including , who offered Suthep his first recording opportunity with the song "Duangchai Thi Ro Khoi" (, 'Awaited Sweetheart'), and and , who wrote "Rak Khun Khao Laeo" (, 'Falling in Love with You'), the hit song that propelled Suthep to national fame in 1954, at the age of nineteen.
Career, later life and death.
Suthep enjoyed a period of great popularity, during which he made many recordings and sang live for films, television, and stage productions. However, he soon reached the age of conscription in 1955. He joined the Royal Thai Air Force, and was assigned to the Music Division, with the rank of leading aircraftman. He served his two years of conscription mostly as a singer for the Air Force's military band, and was chosen as part of a cultural exchange delegation to the People's Republic of China in 1957. However, when Sarit Thanarat took power by coup shortly after their return, the delegates became accused of being Communist supporters, and Suthep had to flee to Japan, where he attended the Tokyo University of the Arts for three years before being allowed to return and resume his singing career.
In 1967, Suthep began writing as a columnist, first about the country's music scene for "Fah Muang Thai" magazine, then expanding in 1970 to write about politics for "Thairath", "Ban Muang", "Siam Rath", and several other newspapers. When the 14 October 1973 uprising toppled the military government, he joined the New Force Party and stood for election in Bangkok's Phaya Thai District and later in his hometown, but failed to be elected both times. Following the suspension of parliament during the military government of 1976, he again stood for election in 1979, and was elected to the House of Representatives, representing Nakhon Ratchasima. He failed to be re-elected in 1983, but joined the Palang Dharma Party and successfully stood for election in 1988, representing Bangkok until the 1991 coup, after which he retired from politics.
In his personal life, Suthep married Pussadee (née Anakkhamontree) in 1967. They had one son, Ritthikrai.
Suthep remained active into his 80s, when his health deteriorated. He had a stroke in early 2019, and was admitted to Siriraj Hospital for over a month due to a blood infection. He died at home in Bangkok on 27 February 2020, aged 85.
Works and recognition.
Suthep made over 3,000 recordings of songs (5,000 by some counts) by 138 different writers over a career spanning forty years, from 1953 to 1993. He was the best known male singer (outside of the Suntaraporn band) of "luk krung" or 'urban music', a genre highly influenced by big band jazz, and has been called the "king of "luk krung"" and "the Frank Sinatra of Thailand". In addition to "Rak Khun Khao Laeo", other well known songs performed by him include "Luk Kamphra" (, 'Orphan'), "Phit Thang Rak" (, 'Wrong Way to Love'), "Thoe Yu Nai" (, 'Where Are You?'), and "Botrian Kon Wiwa" (, 'Lesson Before the Wedding'). His style of singing earned him reputation as a crooner; writer Rong Wongsawan once described his voice as smooth like "silk rubbed against beer foam". He also had acting roles in several films, and sang the title songs for many. In his retirement, he served as president of the Singers Association of Thailand.
As recognition of his contributions to the genre, Suthep was named a National Artist in performing arts (modern Thai music) in 1990. Other honours he received include five royal Golden Record awards, two Golden Radio awards, and an honorary doctorate from Ramkhamhaeng University in 2000. He was granted the military rank of pilot officer in 2005.

Acinus

An acinus (; : acini; adjective, acinar or acinous) refers to any cluster of cells that resembles a many-lobed "berry", such as a raspberry ("acinus" is Latin for "berry"). The berry-shaped termination of an exocrine gland, where the secretion is produced, is acinar in form, as is the alveolar sac containing multiple alveoli in the lungs.
Exocrine glands.
Acinar exocrine glands are found in many organs, including:
The thyroid follicles can also be considered of acinar formation but in this case the follicles, being part of an "endocrine" gland, act as a hormonal deposit rather than to facilitate secretion.&lt;br&gt;
Mucous acini usually stain pale, while serous acini usually stain dark.&lt;br&gt;
Lungs.
The end of the terminal bronchioles in the lungs mark the beginning of a pulmonary acinus that includes the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli.

Woollahra Public School

Woollahra Public School, (previously known as Woollahra Demonstration School), is a main school located in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, Australia, in the suburb of Woollahra, near Edgecliff.
Description.
Though accepting students from Kindergarten to Year 6, Woollahra Public has for some time offered education for selected students in the academic area. These are called opportunity classes. Each Opportunity Class holds 30 students.
Woollahra Public is one of the oldest public schools in Sydney, having opened in 1878. It was designed by W. Kemp and J. Wigram, and is listed on the Register of the National Estate. It celebrated its centenary in 1978 and a time capsule was buried in the grounds. 
History.
Woollahra Public School was formally opened in 1879 with 300 children enrolled into three rooms. In 1891, extensions to the building were completed, and the enrolment was 1200. The school was changed to Woollahra Superior Public School to cater for the older and more senior students.
Since the 1930s, Woollahra has offered the Opportunity (OC) classes, catering for intellectually gifted children in the Eastern Suburbs. In 1961, due to their contribution to teacher education, the school's name was changed to Woollahra Demonstration School, but was changed back to Woollahra Public School as the Alexander Mackie Teachers College moved to Oatley in 1979, detaching their teaching program with the school's.
In 1978, a mural was painted on the old School Hall, featuring Central Australia's Olga Mountains, to celebrate its centenary.

San Francesco di Paola, Naples

San Francesco di Paola is a prominent church located to the west in Piazza del Plebiscito, the main square of Naples, Italy. The construction started in 1816 and ended in 1846.
In the early 19th century, King Joachim Murat of Naples (Napoleon's brother-in-law) planned the entire square and the large building with the colonnades as a tribute to the emperor. When Napoleon was finally dispatched, the Bourbons were restored to the throne of Naples. Ferdinand I continued the construction - finished in 1846 - but converted the final product into the church one sees today. He dedicated it to Saint Francis of Paola, who had stayed in a monastery on this site in the 16th century.
The church is reminiscent of the Pantheon in Rome. The façade is fronted by a portico resting on six columns and two Ionic pillars. Inside, the church is circular with two side chapels. The dome is high. The portico is by Neapolitan architect Leopoldo Laperuta, while the main building is by the Swiss architect .
Interior.
The interior has a number of statues: a "San Giovanni Crisostomo" by Gennaro Calì, "Sant'Ambrogio" by Tito Angelini, "St Luke" by Antonio Calì, a "St Matthew" by Carlo Finelli, a "St John Evangelist" by Pietro Tenerani, "St Mark" by Giuseppe de Fabris, a "Sant'Agostino" by Tommaso Arnaud, and a "Sant'Attanasio" by Angelo Solani.
In the chapels on the right, we find the following altarpieces: "San Nicola da Tolentino" and "St Francis of Paola receives a stem of charity from an Angel", by Nicola Carta, "Final Communion of San Ferdinando di Castiglia" by Pietro Benvenuti, a "Transit di St Joseph" by Camillo Gerra, the "Immaculate Conception and the death of Sant'Andrea Avellino" by Tommaso de Vivo.
Before the main altar, is a 1641 work by Anselmo Cangiano, transferred here in 1835, from the church of the Santi Apostoli. In the apse is a painting of "St Francis of Paola resuscitates a dead man" by Vincenzo Camuccini. In the sacristy is an "Immaculate Conception" by Gaspare Landi and a "Circumcision of Jesus" by Antonio Campi

Schloss Benrath

Schloss Benrath (Benrath Palace) is a Baroque-style "maison de plaisance" (pleasure palace) in Benrath, which is now a borough of Düsseldorf. It was erected for the Elector Palatine Charles Theodor and his wife, Countess Palatine Elisabeth Auguste of Sulzbach, by his garden and building director Nicolas de Pigage. Construction began in 1755 and was completed in 1770. The ensemble at Benrath has been proposed for designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Buildings.
The main building, the central "corps de logis", for the Elector Palatine and his wife is flanked by two arched symmetrical wings, the "maisons de cavalière", which originally housed the servants. They partially surround a circular pond, the "Schlossweiher" (palace pond), in the north. On the southside lies a long rectangular pond, the "Spiegelweiher" (mirror pond). From the predescant castle, which stood formerly in the mid of the long rectangular pond on the southside of the palace, is conserved only one of the servant wings, the so-called "Alte Orangerie" (Old Orangery).
Museums.
The main building "corps de logis" is a museum with guided tours. Sometimes music concerts are also performed. The two wings house two museums since 2002: the "Museum for European Garden Art" in the east wing and the "Museum of Natural History" in the west wing.
Park.
It is surrounded by a Baroque square hunting park with two crossing diagonal alleys and a circular alley.

<doc id="7027313" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7027313" title="Coatomer">
Coatomer

The coatomer is a protein complex that coats membrane-bound transport vesicles. Two types of coatomers are known:
Coatomers are functionally analogous and evolutionarily homologous to clathrin adaptor proteins, also known as adaptins, which regulate endocytosis from the plasma membrane and transport from the trans-Golgi network to lysosomes.
Structure.
The coatomer protein complex is made up of seven nonidentical protein subunits. These seven nonidentical protein subunits are part of two protein subcomplexes. The first subcomplex consists of Ret1(α-COP), Sec27(β’-COP), and Sec 28(ε-COP). The second subcomplex consists of Sec26 (β-COP), Sec21 (γ-COP), Ret2(δ-COP), and Ret3 (ζ-COP).
COPI.
COPI is a coatomer that coats the vesicles transporting proteins from the Golgi complex to the ER. This pathway is referred to as retrograde transport. Before the COP I protein can coat vesicles on the Golgi membrane, it must interact with a small GTPase called ARF1 (ADP ribosylation factor). ARF1 that is bound to GDP interacts with the Golgi complex membrane. Next, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in the Golgi complex membrane exchange the GDP bound to ARF1 for GTP. This activates ARF1, allowing it to insert an amphipathic alpha helix into the lipid bilayer of the Golgi complex. Next, the ARF1 protein recruits COP1 to the Golgi complex membrane by interacting with β-COP and γ-COP. Once the vesicle is coated, it begins to travel to the ER. Before the vesicle can fuse with the ER membrane, the coats surrounding the vesicle must dissociate. ARF-GAP1 is responsible for deactivating the ARF1 protein by activating the GTPase. When ARF1 switches to its GDP- bound conformation, it causes the COP1 coat to destabilize.
The COP1 proteins recognize the proper cargo by interacting with sorting signals on the cytoplasmic domains of the protein. The most common sorting signals include the amino acid sequence KKXX or KDEL. KKXX signals are associated with transmembrane ER domains and KDEL signals are associated with proteins in the ER lumen. COP1 coated vesicles also contain p24 proteins that assist with cargo sorting.
COPII.
COPII is a coatomer that coats the vesicles transporting proteins from the ER to the golgi complex. This pathway is referred to as anterograde transport. The first step in the COPII pathway is the recruitment of a small GTPase named Sar1 to the ER membrane. Once Sar1 interacts with the ER membrane, a membrane protein called Sec12 acts a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and substitutes GDP for GTP on Sar1. This activates the Sar1 protein, causing its amphipathic alpha helix to bind to the ER membrane. Membrane bound Sar1 attracts the Sec23-Sec24 protein heterodimer to the ER membrane. Sar1 directly binds to Sec23 while Sec24 directly binds to the cargo receptor located on the ER membrane.
The Sar1-GTP and Sec23-24 complex recruits another protein complex called Sec13/Sec31. This complex polymerizes to form the outer layer of the coat. COP II vesicles must shed their coat before they can fuse with the cis-Golgi membrane. This occurs when the GTP on Sar1 is hydrolyzed by the GTPase activating protein. Activation of the GTPase also reverses the interaction between Sar1 and the Sec23-Sec24 protein dimer. COPII vesicles select the proper cargo by directly interacting with ER export signals that are present in transmembrane ER proteins. There are several classes of ER export signals that have been identified in various organisms. The involvement of so many different ER export signals means that there are multiple binding sites for the export signals.
Diseases associated with defects in COP.
Newly made secretory proteins must pass through the ER and the golgi complex before they can leave the cell. Problems with COPII early secretory pathways can lead to a disease called Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia type II. This is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from the mutation of a gene called Sec23B. This gene plays an important role in regulating the transport of proteins within cells. Symptoms for Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia type II include anemia, jaundice, low reticulocyte count, splenomegaly, and hemochromatosis. Congenital Dyserythropoeitic Anemia Type II is normally diagnosed during adolescence or early adulthood. Congenital Dyserythropoetic Anemia Type II is a very rare disease with only a few hundred cases worldwide. Treatment for the disease involves blood transfusions, iron therapy, and the removal of the spleen.
Another disease associated with deficiencies in the COPII pathway is combined factor V and factor VIII deficiency. In this disease, the person produces Factor V and VIII but they can not transport factor V or VIII into the bloodstream. This is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to bleeding symptoms, epistaxis, menorrhagia, and excessive bleeding after trauma. The disease can be diagnosed after screening tests are analyzed by a specialized healthcare provider. The mutation of the MCFD2 gene is what causes combined factor V and VIII deficiency. Treatment for the disease includes administrating frozen plasma and desmopressin to the patient.

Empress Erzhu (Yuan Gong's wife)

Empress Erzhu (爾朱皇后, personal name unknown) was an empress of the Xianbei-led Chinese Northern Wei dynasty. Her husband was Emperor Jiemin, and she was a daughter of the general Erzhu Zhao. To distinguish her from her sister who married Yuan Ye, her sister is referred to as "Empress Jianming" ("Jianming" being the era name of Yuan Ye's reign).
Very little is known about her. Her father Erzhu Zhao had come to prominence after members of the Erzhu clan, avenging the head of the clan Erzhu Rong (Erzhu Zhao's uncle), overthrew Emperor Xiaozhuang in 530. With the general Gao Huan declaring a rebellion in 531 and with the Erzhu camp itself in internal disarray, Erzhu Rong's cousin Erzhu Shilong tried to keep the unity within the clan by persuading Emperor Jiemin to marry her as empress in April 532. Later that year, however, Gao Huan defeated the Erzhus and captured the capital Luoyang, imprisoning Emperor Jiemin and replacing him with Emperor Xiaowu, who then poisoned Emperor Jiemin to death. Erzhu Zhao himself tried to hold out against Gao, but by 533 had been defeated, and he committed suicide. Unlike her older sister, who was Yuan Ye's empress, who is known to have then become Gao's concubine, nothing further is known about this Empress Erzhu.

Paul Kosok

Paul August Kosok (21 April 1898 – 1959), was an American professor of history and government, who is credited as the first serious researcher of the Nazca Lines in Peru. His work on the lines started in 1939, when he was doing field study related to the irrigation systems of ancient cultures. By the 1950s, he had completed extensive mapping of more than 300 ancient canals in Peru, in collaboration with archeologist Richard P. Schaedel. Kosok demonstrated the culture's sophisticated management of water to support their settlements.
Observing the Nazca Lines, he recognized that some patterns represented living creatures, and some lines related to astronomical events. His study of archeo-astronomy aspects contributed to the recognition of the lines as an important archeological resource, which Peru has protected. The Nazca Lines were designated in 1994 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Early life and education.
Kosok was born in Long Island City, New York, the son of August and Maria Kosok, immigrants from Germany. He attended public schools before going to college where he earned a doctorate in history.
Academic career.
Kosok began as an assistant professor of history at Long Island University (LIU) in Brooklyn, where he taught several courses in history. His work, "Modern Germany: A Study of Conflicting Loyalties," (1933), was written before the Nazis came to power and published by the University of Chicago Press as part of its "Studies of the Making of Citizens". One reviewer describe this as a "series on civic training in various countries and systems". Kosok's book was used by the State Department and others in training and preparing individuals for foreign service. It was reprinted in 1969.
As part of his education, Kosok studied and traveled in Europe in 1928 and in 1937. His early teaching at LIU included classes in the history of science.
In the 1930s, Kosok became interested in irrigation systems of ancient cultures, and their relation to patterns of settlement. He devoted most of the next twenty years of research to that topic, during which he collaborated with the archeologist Richard P. Schaedel. For instance, together they identified and mapped more than 300 ancient canals of prehistoric Peru, and found that the people had built highly sophisticated systems for shifting water from one valley to another.
Kosok did field studies in Peru in 1940-1941 and 1948-1949, becoming more involved in anthropology as a result of this direction of research. He went to Peru to study the ancient canal systems, "reconstruct the maximum areas of pre-Columbian cultivation, and assess the relation of irrigation to settlement patterns".
He soon realized that the Nazca Lines were too shallow to have acted as part of the irrigation system. On a flight over them, Kosok realized that one pattern represented a bird. He also noticed that some of the lines converged on that date of the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. This inspired his study of the lines to assess if they were related to astronomy, as he knew that solar events were closely followed by ancient agricultural societies for their planting cycles.
Following his field studies on the irrigation systems, Kosok planned two volumes: one of general interest and one more technical. He was working on the general interest book on the irrigation of ancient cultures when he died in 1959; it was published posthumously in 1965 with the support of Schaedel. His manuscript for a scholarly text needed work that was to be undertaken by the University of Texas. Kosok's book included extensive mapping of canals through numerous valleys and innovative use of aerial photography. His work was praised posthumously as a "program of research about the significance of irrigation on the North Coast of Peru to both Andean and cross-cultural studies, a source-book of ideas and hypotheses for generations of field workers".
Beginning in 1940, Kosok was aided in Peru by Maria Reiche, a German translator and mathematician from Lima. She spoke five languages and aided in mapping the lines, as well as assessing how the massive figures might have been scaled up from smaller drawings or patterns. After Kosok left Peru in 1949, Reiche continued to study the Nazca Lines, soon mapping 18 more figures. She worked for the rest of her life to preserve the Nazca Lines and have them recognized until her own death in 1998 in Peru. In 1994 they were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
A musician, Kosok also conducted the Brooklyn Philharmonic at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Inspired by his travels in Peru, he composed "The Andean Rhapsody." He conducted its premiere by the Brooklyn Philharmonic.
Dr. Kosok became chairman of the Department of History and Government at Long Island University, located in Brooklyn, New York. He was a respected scholar in history, anthropology, music and mathematics.
Marriage and family.
Kosok married Rose Wyler. She traveled and worked with him in Peru in 1941 when he was doing field studies there. Of their children, their son Michael accompanied his parents to Peru in 1948–49.

Royal Carillon School &quot;Jef Denyn&quot;

The Royal Carillon School "Jef Denyn" (; informally also the Mechelen carillon school) is a music school in Mechelen, Belgium, that specializes in the carillon. It is the first and largest carillon school in the world. The Belgian government defines it as an "International Higher Institute for the Carillon Arts under the High Protection of Her Majesty Queen Fabiola". The school has trained many of the foremost carillonneurs of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and houses a rich archive and library.
History.
The Royal Carillon School was founded on August 12, 1922, by renowned city carillonneur of Mechelen Jef Denyn, in whose honor it was later named, with the support of Americans Herbert Hoover, John D. Rockefeller, and William Gorham Rice. The first institution of its kind, the school soon gained international acclaim and has trained carillonneurs from numerous countries, including Australia, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ghana, Japan, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Switzerland, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States. At its founding, tuition was free.
The institution has developed under the successive leadership of Jef Denyn (1862–1941), Staf Nees (1901–1965), Piet Van den Broek (1916–2008), Jo Haazen (b. 1944), and its present director Koen Cosaert (b. 1963). The school has made a significant impact on carillon performance worldwide and is the originating place of the Flemish romantic style of carillon composition and performance.
In 1984, the Royal Carillon School established a branch at the Catholic University of Leuven, and Her Majesty Queen Fabiola conferred her high protection upon the school. Later that year, the school introduced the carillon tradition to Japan. In 1986, the school was elected to membership in the Russian Cultural Committee, and the first Russian students arrived in 1992. Another branch opened in Halle in 1991, and additional branches now exist in Roeselare and Peer. Though the school has always had close ties to Mechelen—each of its first four directors also acted as Mechelen city carillonneur—it operated as an independent Flemish educational institute under its own board of directors until 2008. Since then the city of Mechelen has been legally responsible for the school's administration.
The Queen Fabiola Competition was established by the school in 1987. Every five years, carillonneurs from the world over converge in Mechelen to compete in the most prestigious carillon competition in history. The school also organizes carillon composition contests and publishes works for carillon, campanological literature, and carillon method books.
Prominent visitors to the school include cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, the Vienna Boys' Choir, former Hungarian president Árpád Göncz, Michael I and Queen Anne of Romania, American Ambassador to the Kingdom of Belgium Tom C. Korologos, and Her Majesty Queen Fabiola of Belgium.
Since 1995, the Flemish government has repeatedly conferred the honor upon the school of being Cultural Ambassador of Flanders.
Facilities.
For many years the Royal Carillon School was housed in the historic building "'t Schipke", adjoining the Court of Busleyden, which contained the school's carillon and museum. Due to construction in the Court of Busleyden, 't Schipke was temporarily closed in autumn 2011, so the school and many of the museum holdings moved to their current location on the Bruul, Mechelen's main shopping street. While the carillon at the Court of Busleyden remains available to the school, it is now (2020) rarely used: its role in lessons, rehearsals, and school concerts has mostly been taken over by a new mobile carillon acquired by the school in 2016 and housed in its own pavilion in the Sinte-Mettetuin. In addition to the carillons and museum, school facilities include seven practice keyboards, pianos, a set of English handbells, a library of sheet music, and an important historical archive. Rehearsal and lesson time on the Mechelen city carillon in St. Rumbold's Tower is also available to advanced students. The museum and library holdings include an international collection of bells, historic carillon keyboards, rare books, manuscripts, and art objects.
Academics.
The Royal Carillon School "Jef Denyn" is a private state-subsidized educational institute, and its several courses of study fall under the aegis of "part-time arts education" (Dutch: "deeltijds kunstonderwijs") in Flanders and Mechelen. The full curriculum covers nine or ten years depending on age at entry, but carillonneurs with prior training may graduate as quickly as within one year. Carillon performance, carillon history and campanology, improvisation, theory, harmony, composition, arranging, part-singing, handbell choir, and keyboard instruction comprise the curriculum. To graduate, each student must pass a written campanology/history exam; write and present a thesis on some aspect of carillon culture, e.g. history, campanology, technology, composition, playing technique; and perform an exam recital on the Mechelen city carillon in St. Rumbold's tower that includes baroque, romantic, and contemporary repertoire as well as works of their own (improvisation, arrangement, transcription, and/or composition).
The school also organizes occasional lectures, symposia, and masterclasses, often in conjunction with the Flemish Carillon Society and/or the "Koninklijke Vereniging voor Toren en Beiaard" . There is an annual school field trip to visit different carillons in Belgium, the Netherlands, or northern France. Additional student carillon trips in Belgium and the Netherlands and to international carillon congresses are organized by the student association Campana, which publishes a newsletter, "'t Schipke" .
The school maintains connections with higher institutes of art in Belgium, the "Carillon Instituut Nederland" and "Bourdon Hogeschool voor Muziek" in the Netherlands, and Missouri State University in the United States. The school also maintains an exchange program with the Yale Guild of Carillonneurs and relations with the State Conservatory of Saratov in Russia.
Current tuition fees amount to about 350 € per year.
Degrees and diplomas.
The Royal Carillon School does not offer higher education degrees recognised by any Belgian community.
Diplomas are offered at two levels of secondary education, and advanced students may continue their studies to earn a Final Diploma (Dutch: "einddiploma") or the two-year Diploma of Excellence, an honor awarded to only a few students in the school's history with exceptional talent in composition. In association with the "Carillon Instituut Nederland" and "Bourdon Hogeschool voor Muziek" in the Netherlands, the school began offering bachelor's degrees in 2006. A joint master's degree in carillon with tracks in performance and pedagogy is offered jointly with Missouri State University.

<doc id="7027386" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7027386" title="Universal transit pass">
Universal transit pass

In North America, a Universal Transit Pass (U-Pass)—also known as a Universal Access Transit Pass—is a program that provides students who are enrolled in participating post-secondary institutions with unlimited access to local transit.
Programs are funded through mandatory fees that either eligible students pay for each term in which they are registered or are included in the students' tuition. For example, the University of Washington and the U-Pass program in Chicago have mandatory U-Pass fees. Fees are transferred to the local transit authority to fund the required transit service. Because fees are collected from a large participant base, U-Pass prices are lower than the amount students would otherwise pay for monthly passes or tickets over the course of a term. The U-Pass price charged to students depends on a variety of factors which differ among municipalities, transit systems and post-secondary institutions.
Advantages and disadvantages.
Potential benefits.
U-Pass programs offer students a way to lower their transportation costs while at school and also benefit the local community and the environment. U-Pass programs can provide the following benefits:
Potential costs.
U-Pass programs that require a 100% adoption rate by universities may subsidize the U-Pass at the expense of students who drive, walk, or bike to school and who do not use transit to get to other locations. Some U-Pass programs offer exemptions for students with mobility restrictions and students who live out of the program range, such as exemptions for students who live in Quebec but commute to school in Ottawa, Ontario.
Other disadvantages include:
Canada.
Thirty academic institutions throughout Canada currently participate in a U-Pass program.
In 1973, Queen's University at Kingston implemented the "Bus-It" program with Kingston Transit, making it the first university in Canada to implement a universal transit pass program. Nearby St. Lawrence College also participates in this program. Students are required to pay for the service as part of student activity fees.
United States.
137 academic institutions throughout the United States currently participate in a U-Pass program, including the following.
University of Washington, King County, Washington.
One of the first U-Pass programs in the United States was started at the University of Washington (UW) in conjunction with King County Metro (KCM) in the Seattle area. This program began in 1991 and now offers students access to most public transportation services in the Puget Sound region. The program was initially introduced as a short-term pilot program, only the largest transit operator in the Seattle area, KCM and the main UW campus in Seattle were involved. The pilot was so successful that it became permanent; participation is now mandatory for students at all three UW campuses, and six additional transit agencies have joined the program. Students access the bus service by using their university ID card. The UW U-Pass program is paid for mostly through a student and activity fee of $76 per quarter. The fee is highly discounted and includes full fare coverage on a number of metro, commuter, shuttle, vanpool, and car-sharing transit options.
Participation is optional for faculty and staff, who pay $136/quarter for the program. The university, in turn, pays transit operators on a per trip basis according to a negotiated trip rate. The negotiated trip rate varies by operator, but is lower than the cash fare. Studies of UW's U-Pass program demonstrate that since the program began, drive alone commuting has decreased by some 38%. The U-Pass program resulted in a significant increase in demand for transit services and over time as ridership has increased, so has transit service to the campus. The program also generates approximately $7.5 million annually for King County Metro alone.
Chicago, Illinois.
The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) launched its U-PASS program in 1998. Within three years, 22 colleges and universities had joined the program, by entering into a contractual agreement with CTA to provide the U-Pass to all full-time students. The CTA currently contracts with 52 area colleges and universities to offer all students discounted rides for a semester.
All enrolled students are required to purchase the U-Pass. The pass enables the students to make unlimited trips on all CTA buses and trains during the academic year. Students pay for the pass as part of the regular tuition and fees assessed by the participating institutions. The institutions are charged for the U-PASS based on a daily per student charge that was initially set at 50 cents and increased on a regular basis. Since the fall of 2013, the new rate is $1.07 per day, or about $15 per semester. On a monthly basis, students save a minimum of $66 per month over the full-fare price. U-Pass provides more than 35 million rides annually for students.

Sidney Myer Performing Arts Awards

The Sidney Myer Performing Arts Awards were created in 1984 by the trustees of the Sidney Myer Fund to mark the 50th anniversary of the death of Sidney Myer and ran for 40 years up to and including 2023. The awards were created to commemorate Sidney Myer's life and his love for the arts. They were intended primarily to recognise and reward outstanding achievements in dance, drama, comedy, music, opera, circus and puppetry.
In their final iteration, there was one Individual Award (), one Group Award () and one Facilitator's Prize ().
The Sidney Myer Performing Arts Awards were announced and presented early each year for the preceding year. The awards were decided on a national basis and each nomination was considered by a judging committee. While past achievement was recognised, consideration was also given to the potential of an individual or group to continue their contribution to Australian society through the performing arts into the future.

Nana 2

Nana 2 is a 2006 Japanese drama film directed by Kentarō Ōtani and adapted from the manga by Ai Yazawa. It is the sequel to the 2005 film "Nana". Production for the movie began in mid-September and only one and a half month shootings finished the movie in time for the December 9, 2006 release.
Synopsis.
Taking place shortly after the end of the first film, "Nana 2" focuses more on Nana K. and her love life. Romance develops between Nana K. and Trapnest's bassist Takumi as well as with the Black Stones' guitarist Nobu. Meanwhile, Nana O. works hard for her band while trying to find happiness. Both girls struggle through life, and try to keep their friendship from falling apart.
Casting.
Several actors who portrayed characters in the previous film did not return for "Nana 2". Aoi Miyazaki declined to reprise the role of Nana Komatsu, and was replaced by actress Yui Ichikawa. Ryuhei Matsuda declined to play the role of Ren and was replaced with Nobuo Kyo. Kenichi Matsuyama, who portrayed Shinichi Okazaki, was replaced by Hongo Kanata.
Theatrical release.
Even though both theme songs were released ahead ("Hitoiro" of Nana starring Mika Nakashima on November 29, 2006 and "Truth" of Reira starring Una Ito on December 6, 2006), the movie could only hit the #4 spot on the Movie Charts, from its release December 9, 2006 onward, and overall had very weak and low ratings. Many fans claimed that the exchange of main cast members led to the disappointing statistics.
On December 18, "Nana 2" made its international debut in New York City, United States. New York - Tokyo brought the main actresses Mika Nakashima and Yui Ichikawa to the limited seated IFC Cinema. The movie was well received by fans.
Theme songs.
"Nana 2" once again featured the two artists Mika Nakashima and Yuna Ito, releasing songs under the names Nana starring Mika Nakashima and Reira starring Yuna Ito, respectively.
Nana, starring Mika Nakashima's new single "Hitoiro" featured Takuro of Glay as composer and Nana author Yazawa Ai as the lyricist again. It did not do as well as its predecessor "Glamorous Sky," peaking at only #5 on the Oricon charts. Two weeks after the release of the single, however, Nana starring Mika Nakashima released her first and last album, "The End", which managed to rank at #2 on the Oricon charts.
Reira, starring Yuna Ito's "Truth" had no more luck than Nakashima's new single, ranking in only at the tenth place on the Oricon charts. The music video of the single was filmed in Scotland and used as scenes of the film. Neither of the singles were as record-setting as their predecessors.

Thomas Michael Greenhow

Thomas Michael Greenhow MD MRCS FRCS (5 July 1792 – 25 October 1881) was an English surgeon and epidemiologist.
Career.
Greenhow was the second son of Edward Martin Greenhow, an army surgeon from North Shields. He was a medical graduate of the University of Edinburgh and became MRCS (London) in 1814, having been a surgery student at London's Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals.
Greenhow spent much of his working life in Newcastle. He and fellow surgeon Sir John Fife are recorded together in 1827 as being "Eminent Persons of Newcastle and Gateshead". Greenhow's surgical inventions were heralded by London surgeons in the 1830s. "Debrett's" records that Greenhow was a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, having become, in 1843, one of the original 300 fellows.
Greenhow worked in all areas of surgery and had a particular interest in obstetrics and gynaecology; in 1845, he controversially published detailed accounts regarding his views on the gynaecological status of Harriet Martineau, who was both his patient and sister-in-law.
Greenhow was a pioneer in the establishment of the Durham University and in 1855 was a lecturer at the Newcastle's Medical College, in connection with Durham University. He and Sir John Fife founded what would become the Newcastle University College of Medicine. The two men also founded Newcastle's Eye Infirmary. Greenhow worked as the senior surgeon at the Newcastle Infirmary, later renamed the Royal Victoria Infirmary, for many years and was instrumental in its expansion in the 1850s. While working there, he trained John Snow. Greenhow and Snow both advocated for the usage of chloroform when performing major surgery and undertook "dedicated research" to end the London cholera pandemic. Greenhow's son, surgeon Henry Martineau Greenhow, reported in "The Lancet" his father's surgical success involving chloroform.
Greenhow and his nephew, physician Edward Headlam Greenhow, undertook much research into medical hygiene and public health, publishing papers throughout the 1850s warning of further impending cholera pandemics. The archives of King's College London hold an 1866 letter from E. H. Greenhow concerning the 1849 cholera breakout in Manchester, with which both men were greatly involved. "The Lancet" records that at a meeting in 1855 of the Epidemiological Society of London, John Snow responded to a paper being read out by Edward Headlam Greenhow in which the research of his uncle, Thomas Michael Greenhow, concerning the 1831–32 cholera epidemic in Tynemouth was outlined. On 6 May 1856, Thomas Greenhow delivered a lecture on this topic at his alma mater, St Thomas' Hospital, where Snow was working as an anaesthetist. In October 1856, Edward Headlam Greenhow became Lecturer on Public Health at St Thomas'.
Thomas Greenhow retired to Leeds in 1860, dying there on 25 October 1881 at Newton Hall.
Family.
Greenhow's first wife was Elizabeth Martineau (1794–1850), who succumbed to tuberculosis after producing four children. She was a daughter of Thomas Martineau and Elizabeth Rankin, of the prosperous, socially reformist Martineau family, mainly based in Birmingham. His wife's siblings included the religious philosopher James Martineau and the sociologist and political theorist Harriet Martineau. Greenhow's sister Sarah (1801–1891) married George Martineau (1792–1857), cousin of his wife Elizabeth.
Greenhow's first child and only daughter, Frances, was born in 1821. She married into the Lupton family of Leeds, wealthy wool manufacturers and Unitarians, a branch of English Dissenters. She worked to open up educational opportunities for women, and, more prominently, their access to universities. Her eldest son's first daughter was Olive Christiana Middleton (née Lupton), the great-grandmother of Catherine, Princess of Wales.
Greenhow's first son and second child, Edward Meadows Greenhow, (1822–1840) died at the age of 18. His second son, Henry Martineau Greenhow (1829 1912), followed his father into medicine. He studied at University College London, and by 1854, he was a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He joined the Indian Medical Service spending his entire career in British India, and rising to surgeon major. He married Jessie, daughter of Thomas Lombe Taylor. Their son Wilfred Harry Greenhow (1872–1950) went to Marlborough College and Exeter college, Oxford MA. Wilfred's daughter Anita Diana (1917–1991) married Walter Julian Algernon Boyle, grandson of Henry Boyle 5th Earl Shannon. Greenhow's third and youngest son, Judge William Thomas Greenhow (1831–1921) received his Bachelor of Laws at Somerset House at King's College London in 1853. He married his second cousin Marion, eldest daughter of Charles Martineau. They had a daughter, Mabel.
In 1854 at Leeds' Mill Hill Chapel, Greenhow married his second wife, Anne (1812–1905), daughter of William Lupton, the father-in-law of Greenhow's daughter Frances Lupton.

Ernst Tandefelt

Knut Ernst Robert Tandefelt (10 March 1876 in Sysmä, Finland – 3 May 1948 in Sipoo, Finland) was a Swedish-speaking Finnish nobleman.
The mentally unstable Tandefelt shot the Finnish Minister of Internal Affairs Heikki Ritavuori dead at Ritavuori's home door at Nervanderinkatu 11 in Etu-Töölö, Helsinki on 14 February 1922, to affect Finland's politics in the Kindred Nations Wars "(heimosodat)" taking place in Eastern Karelia. The event was the only murder of a government minister and the only political assassination in the entire history of independent Finland.
Tandefelt has often been suspected of having acted because of an extreme right-wing conspiracy, but there is no binding evidence of this. Tandefelt himself said he acted alone.
Tandefelt was sentenced to life imprisonment of hard labor. Later, the Supreme Court of Finland ordered him to undergo a mental health examination. Tandefelt was legally found to be partially insane and the sentence was lowered to 12 years of hard labor. Tandefelt died in the Nikkilä's mental hospital on 3 May 1948.
Tandefelt's grandfather was the second cousin of Otto Johan Tandefelt, one of the convicted participants in the lynch mob that killed Axel von Fersen in 1810.

Santa Maria del Carmine, Naples

Santa Maria del Carmine (Our Lady of Mount Carmel) is a church in Naples, Italy. It is at one end of Piazza Mercato (Market Square), the centre of civic life in Naples for many centuries until it was cut off from the rest of the city by urban renewal in 1900. The church was founded in the 13th century by Carmelite friars driven from the Holy Land in the Crusades, presumably arriving in the Bay of Naples aboard Amalfitan ships. Some sources, however, place the original refugees from Mount Carmel as early as the eighth century. The church is still in use and the 75–metre bell tower is visible from a distance even amidst taller modern buildings.
The square adjacent to the church was the site in 1268 of the execution of Conradin, the last Hohenstaufen heir to the throne of the kingdom of Naples, at the hands of Charles I of Anjou, thus beginning the Angevin reign of the kingdom. Conrad's mother, Elisabeth of Bavaria, founded the church for the good of the souls of her young son and his companion, Frederick of Baden as well as a resting place for their remains, where they remain today. A statue was erected to Conrad's memory, commissioned by then crown-prince, Maximilian II of Bavaria, designed by the Neoclassic sculptor Thorvaldsen, and completed by his pupil Schopf in 1847.
In 1647 the square was the site of battles between rebels and royal troops during Masaniello's revolt, and later, in 1799, it was the scene of the mass execution of leaders of the Neapolitan Republic of 1799. The area – including parts of the church premises – was heavily bombed in World War II and still shows the scars of the devastation.
The old monastic grounds adjacent to the church now serve as a shelter for the needy and homeless. The church is home to two renowned religious relics: one, the painting of the "Brown Madonna" (Italian: "Madonna Bruna"), is said to have been brought by the original Carmelites; the second is a figure of the Crucifixion in which the crown of thorns is missing. According to legend, the crown fell off as Christ's head moved when the building was struck by a cannonball in 1439 during the Aragonese siege.
Interior.
The elaborate Baroque decoration (1755–56), including stucco, carved wood, and polychrome marble, was designed by Nicola Tagliacozzi Canale. The statue of "St Michael Archangel" is attributed to Girolamo Santacroce. The church also has a funeral monument to Conradin of Swabia. The chapels have altarpieces by Mattia Preti, Giovanni Sarnelli, Matteo Bottigliero, Francesco De Mura, Francesco Solimena, and Antonio Sarnelli. The Chapel of the Virgin del Carmelo, has a 12th-century icon of the Virgin and child. The presbytery has some alabaster urns. The main altar was completed by Pietro and Giuseppe Mazzetti. The sacristy has frescoes by Filippo Falciatore, depicting Carmelite Order saints. The bell tower was rebuilt by architect Giuseppe Nuvolo in the 17th century, and has an onion-dome cupola decorated with maiolica.

Relief Camp Workers' Union

Relief Camp Workers' Union was a Canadian Great Depression era relief union in which the workers employed in the Canadian government relief camps organized themselves into in the early 1930s. The RCWU was established by the Workers' Unity League and was associated with the Communist Party of Canada. The creation of the union was a direct response to the conditions of the camps and the lack of financial compensation for the work the men provided. The union is best known for helping to organize the On-to-Ottawa Trek during the Great Depression.
Historical context and the origins of relief camps in Canada.
Initial approaches to relief.
During the Great Depression in Canada ( 1929 to 1939), a time of economic hardship spanning a decade, many people faced food scarcity, reduction of wages or precarious work, and overall reduction in their quality of life. The Depression operated worldwide - however, the degree to which it affected different countries differed drastically. By 1933 the rapid decline in exports of wheat, manufactured goods, and raw materials had caused a near-complete economic collapse across Canada.
Municipal, provincial, and federal governments disputed over how to deal with the growing numbers of the unemployed, and - as a consequence of this - with the growing hostility from the initial lack of action and guidance from the different levels of government. Relief, initially, was the responsibility of municipal governments - but the increasing numbers of unemployed in the early years was already straining the small financial reserves that municipalities had. The Ontario government, for example, introduced public works in urban and isolated areas early on to help ease unemployment, but between 1929 and 1932 employment fell by 32 percent and these early relief systems could no longer cope. In British Columbia, the province's reliance on the exportation of raw materials meant that citizens were hit particularly hard by the Depression - similarly to Ontario, unemployment had reached 30% by 1933. In the prairies, years of droughts and failed crops, in combination with declining commodity prices, caused families with long-standing histories in the region to pack up and move westward in search of employment. Vancouver became a hub for transient workers and their families as, in contrast to smaller communities, it had a pre-established Relief Department. Moreover, British Columbia offered a more temperate climate compared to the rest of Canada, meaning those who were without homes were less likely to freeze overnight or during the winter months.
Relief for married vs single men.
Before the establishment of government camps, single men found it difficult to receive relief. Social attitudes at the time, and the fact that the Depression predated the emergence of the welfare state in Canada, meant that accepting relief came with a certain amount of stigma. At this point in history, Canadians commonly believed that men "should engage in waged work and be individualistic, productive and physically strong". Even during the Depression, Canadian society believed that single men should be responsible for themselves and not burden their families by staying with them if they were not contributing a wage. In Guelph, Ontario, men with dependants were given two days work a week whereas single men with no dependants were given two days work every two weeks. As the Depression worsened, single men were given work two days work every three weeks and were often paid in cash and with relief vouchers. This cultural sentiment towards men and a favouritization of married men or men with dependants caused a mass migration of transient men looking for employment in Canada. The responsibility to then relieve tensions fell on the federal government.
Federal relief camps.
The government of Canada was aware of unrest due to the Depression and feared that lack of economic opportunity might turn the mostly single unemployed men to communism or to communist ideas. These fears, coupled with pre-existing fears that pre-dated the Depression, encouraged the federal government to outlaw the Communist Party of Canada in 1931. Government officials needed a place to put single men and give them something to do in order to curb communist ideas and sentiments. In 1932 Major-General Andrew McNaughton, then the chief of General Staff of the Department of National Defence, toured the country's military districts to examine the unemployment problem. At the time of his national tour one estimate found over “70,000 mostly single, young, unemployed, homeless men in Canada.”
McNaughton proposed the idea of relief camps to provide men with work to fill their days, food, clothing, medical attention, and some compensation to ease tensions. McNaughton's relief camps were designed to provide the basic necessities for single men in return for manual labour. This proposed system resembled the English Poor Laws in which the poor received helped in exchange for labour and rehabilitation. In October of 1932 the first federal relief camps opened in Canada. In November of 1932 camps started in eastern Canada and immediately housed over 2000 men. To cut costs, the government set up these camps in or in close proximity to existing military facilities and used the military's personnel and administrative experience to keep the camps running effectively. Each camp worked on "projects"; British Columbia had 53 projects and Ontario 37. The system tended to locate camps in more isolated and rural areas and away from urban "agitators" trying to spread communist ideas. Historians and other scholars continue to debate the effectiveness of the camps, but overall, they did help to ease tensions at the start of the Depression.
Origins and Emergence of the Union in Camps.
Life in the Camps.
The federal government wanted to run the camps as effectively and as cheaply as possible but were still required to provide clothing, food, medical care, and money for all men employed in the camps. Although these terms were met, the quality of the food, clothing, and housing were repeatedly called into question. The biggest point of contention was the money to which the men were promised. The men worked for twenty cents per day for each day worked but there was much debate about whether the payment was a wage or an allowance. Moreover, there were issues with money being withheld from the workers.
Grievances.
Grievances about the camp system were numerous, from the poor quality food, the lack of leisure facilities (bathrooms and showers), and that the men were only paid twenty cents per day. Complaints came from both internal and external sources. Organized labour outside of the camps criticized the cheap labour as it meant organized union workers from various trades would be less likely to receive work. Internally, workers in these camps recognized that a paradox existed; they knew their work was valuable yet they were simultaneously marginalized by society because of their social and economic status. This paradox caused relief workers to organize. They believed that since their work was valuable as they were constructing roads, airways, and forestry infrastructure, that they should be paid a fair wage. Certainly conditions were a source of grievance but they were tied into the fight for more money and less military control.
The federal government tried to maintain individuality among the men as to eliminate or stop the spread of an emerging collective conscious. This did not work as relief workers organized and created the RCWU. During relief camp strikes, workers and the union pressed for forty cents per hour as well as a five day work week, working a total of seven hours per day. RCWU rhetoric painted the relief camps as ‘slave camps’ and workers were engaged in ‘slave wage labour’. These sentiments and the growing discontent consequently caused the RCWU's numbers to quickly swell. The emergence of the RCWU was cause for concern and being associated with or organizing collectively within the camps would result in expulsion from the camps. As a result, RCWU organizers worked covertly in building the union because they faced being blacklisted from the camps.
Camp Strikes.
The RCWU organized its first strike in December 1934. In the four years that the federal relief camps ran, there were "359 recorded strikes, riots, demonstrations, and disturbances in all projects across Canada." Since the union was established by the WUL, they used their experience in organizing the unemployed in urban relief camps. The strikes were short-lived and the strikers returned to the camps with just a promise of a government commission to investigate their complaints.
In Ontario and in other areas, the disturbances were not as severe as those in British Columbia because there were far fewer men in these camps and therefore, far fewer 'agitators' making their way to those camps. 
The RCWU managed to provide lodging and food for its members but by the end of May of 1935, their resources had begun to run dry and the demonstrations became fewer and far between. The RCWU was left with little resources but they did have a growing number of unhappy men. In June of 1935, the men embarked on a long journey which is now known as the On-to-Ottawa Trek. They rode on top of freight trains headed east to present their demands for Prime Minister Bennett in Ottawa but were subsequently stopped in the city of Regina.
RCWU Strikes Outside the Camps.
While in Vancouver, they protested regularly to raise public awareness of their rights. RCWU organizers made it a priority to maintain discipline in the ranks so as not to alienate public opinion. One occasion in particular was an exception to this rule. During one of the RCWU "snake parades", marching in a zig zag through the streets, usually in columns of two, the leader noticed that the entrance to the Hudson's Bay Company department store was unguarded. Other stores all had guards posted and shut their doors because the protesters would parade through the stores to present their case to shoppers. This time, on April 26, the manager of the store telephoned the police, who promptly arrived and attempted to eject the men. A fight ensued, ending with broken display cases and several injuries. One police officer was severely injured. The demonstrators and other protesters converged for a rally at Victory Square, where Mayor McGeer came and read the riot act and the crowd dispersed. Another notable moment during the relief camp strike was when a group of RCWU strikers occupied the city museum for eight hours, coming out only after a promise was given that the city would give them money to feed the strikers for three days.
Intransigence at all three levels of government became apparent throughout the strike, with the civic government looking to the provincial and federal governments to take responsibility for the crisis of unemployment. The provincial Liberal government had been elected on the platform of "Work and Wages", a slogan appropriated by the strikers to emphasize that this promise had gone unfulfilled. The federal Conservative government under R.B. "Iron Heel" Bennett, meanwhile, argued that policing and relief were provincial and municipal responsibilities, but if they could not control the situation themselves, a request could be made for federal forces under "aid to civil defense" provisions. This intransigence helped to generate public support for the strikers, even among conservatives who agreed that the "Red Menace" was a real threat to Canadian society and should be dealt a decisive blow.
The city, provincial, and federal police were all standing by during the strike, along with several hundred special constables because, the government claimed, it was part of a larger plot on the part of the Communists, on orders from Moscow, to spark a general strike in Vancouver. Another strike was developing amongst longshoremen, whose union was also under WUL leadership, and the government feared that the two might merge into one large strike, which might spread. The relief camp strikers, however, decided that they had accomplished all they could in Vancouver, and voted to take their grievances to Ottawa in what became the more famous On-to-Ottawa Trek.
After the Trek.
The On-to-Ottawa Trek was crushed in Regina, and most of the men returned to the camps, but their efforts instigated the process which would lead to significant reforms and were later considered by historians to be an important turning point paving the way for the post war welfare state in Canada. In 1935, the Communists' abandoned the Third Period doctrine under which the WUL toiled, and many RCWU Communists left to fight fascism in the Spanish Civil War with the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion. The relief camp issue would once again descend on Vancouver in 1938 when the RCWU's successor, the Relief Project Workers' Union led another walk out and another series of protests. The climax this time came when, on May 20, 1938, a group of protesters occupied a number of buildings including the post office in the Winch Building (now the Sinclair Centre). Over a thousand men continued to occupy the post office for almost a month, until they were violently removed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on June 18 in what came to be known as "Bloody Sunday." Many were injured (including several police officers) and 28 men were jailed. Protesters in Vancouver and Victoria demanded the release of the prisoners and the resignation of Premier Patullo.

The Writing 69th

The Writing 69th was a group of eight American journalists who trained to fly bomber missions over Germany with the U.S. Eighth Air Force during World War II.
The beginnings.
The Writing 69th was so christened by one of the 8th Air Force's public relations officers, perhaps Hal Leyshon or Joe Maher. The group also considered the names "The Flying Typewriters" or the "Legion of the Doomed." The Writing 69th included Walter Cronkite, Andy Rooney, Homer Bigart, and Robert Post, among others.
Members.
The Writing 69th included:
In addition to the writers of the 69th, five newsreel cameramen took part in the training with the Flying Typewriters. They and their affiliations were:
The training.
The reporters who accompanied the 8th Air Force were required to undergo a rigorous training course in just one week. They trained in a multitude of tasks, including how to shoot weapons, despite rules barring non-combatants from carrying a weapon into combat. The men were also trained on how to adjust to high altitudes, parachuting, and enemy identification.
The first and last mission.
The first and last mission for the Writing 69th would come on February 26, 1943. A group of American B-24s and B-17s were dispatched to attack the Focke-Wulf aircraft factory in Bremen, Germany. As fate would have it, the skies over Bremen were overcast, and the bombing run had to be diverted to a secondary target, the submarine pens at Wilhelmshaven.
Of the eight journalists who comprised the Writing 69th, only six went on that fateful mission; Post, Cronkite, Rooney, Wade, Bigart, and Hill. Over Oldenburg, Germany, the American bomber group encountered German fighters. Post's B-24 was shot down and exploded in mid-air. Eight Air Force crew members were killed, along with Post. The other aircraft returned safely, though Rooney's sustained some flak (anti-aircraft) damage. Post's death effectively ended the days of reporters flying on bombing missions. Others, including Scott and Manning (who both missed the Wilhelmshaven raid), did fly after this mission, but it was not nearly as widespread as it might have been had Post not been killed.

High Deryni

High Deryni is a historical fantasy novel by American-born author Katherine Kurtz. It was first published by Ballantine Books as the sixty-first volume of the celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in September 1973 and has been reprinted a number of times since. A revised and updated edition of the novel was released in 2007 by Ace Books. "High Deryni" was the third of Kurtz' Deryni novels to be published, and the final book in the Chronicles of the Deryni Trilogy. The next Deryni book to be published was "Camber of Culdi", which details events that occur two centuries before "High Deryni". However, the internal literary chronology of events in the Deryni series is continued in "The Bishop's Heir".
Plot introduction.
The novel is set in the land of Gwynedd, one of the fictional Eleven Kingdoms. Gwynedd itself is a medieval kingdom similar to the British Isles of the 12th century, with a powerful Holy Church (based on the Roman Catholic Church), and a feudal government ruled by a hereditary monarchy. The population of Gwynedd includes both humans and Deryni, a race of people with inherent physic and magical abilities who have been shunned and persecuted for centuries. The novel begins three months after the events of "Deryni Checkmate", as young King Kelson Haldane struggles to resolve an internal ecclesiastical schism on the eve of an invasion by a powerful Deryni sorcerer.
Plot summary.
The novel takes place in June and July 1121, less than a year after the coronation of fourteen-year-old King Kelson Haldane. At the beginning of the book, Kelson is leading an army into the Duchy of Corwyn to put down the rebellion of an anti-Deryni zealot named Warin de Grey. Warin is allied with Archbishop Edmund Loris, the leader of the Holy Church. Together, they have taken the ducal capital of Coroth and are openly revolting against the Crown due to Kelson's support of his Deryni advisors, Duke Alaric Morgan and Monsignor Duncan McLain. Morgan and Duncan decide to go to Dhassa and seek to reconcile with the six bishops who have refused to follow Loris' anti-Deryni crusade. Meanwhile, in the border city of Cardosa, King Wencit Furstán, the powerful Deryni ruler of the neighboring kingdom of Torenth, seeks to convince Earl Bran Coris of Marley to betray Kelson and assist in an invasion of Gwynedd.
Morgan and Duncan arrive at Dhassa and surrender to the bishops, who are led by Thomas Cardiel and Denis Arilan. After hearing their explanations for their previous actions, the two bishops agree to forgive them. On the border, Earl Sean Lord Derry, Morgan's aide, is captured by Bran Coris. Coris has decided to betray Kelson and immediately turns Derry over to Wencit, who begins to torture Derry both physically and mentally. Morgan senses Derry's pain when he attempts to contact him, but his use of his powers is detected by Bishop Arilan, who reveals that he is also Deryni.
Kelson's army then marches to Coroth, where the young king confronts the rebellious archbishop. Unwilling to assault Coroth directly, Morgan sneaks into the castle with Kelson, Duncan, and Bishop Cardiel. Once inside, they confront Warin and force him to re-evaluate his beliefs by comparing his mysterious healing ability to Morgan's. Having acquired Warin's aid, Kelson confronts Loris the following morning and takes the archbishop into custody.
With the internal ecclesiastical schism now resolved, Kelson's army prepares to face the invading Torenthi army. Kelson learns of Bran Coris' treason, but is nonetheless determined to win the war. The Gwyneddan army arrives at the border shortly thereafter and is greeted by grisly evidence of Bran Coris' betrayal. During a parley session with the Torenthi invaders, Morgan manages to rescue Derry, but the army is unable to prevent the murder of fifty Gwyneddan soldiers, including Duncan's father. Wencit challenges Kelson to a Duel Arcane, a form of ritualized magical combat in which each king will be accompanied by three companions. Before Kelson can agree, Arilan suddenly requests a brief period to consider the challenge.
A short time later, Arilan reveals that he is not only Deryni, but also a member of the Camberian Council, a secretive group of highly trained Deryni who oversee and regulate such duels. In issuing his challenge, Wencit claims that he has secured the cooperation of the Council, but Arilan has heard nothing of such a request. He establishes a Transfer Portal in Kelson's tent and travels to the Council's chambers, demanding an explanation from his comrades. They soon realize that Wencit has attempted to trick Kelson by bringing four imposters to the duel. Though initially reluctant to arbitrate the duel, the Council finally agrees after Arilan brings Kelson, Morgan, and Duncan to confront them.
The following morning, Kelson rides out to face Wencit, accompanied by Morgan, Duncan, and Arilan. Although furious when the real Council arrives, Wencit eventually concedes to their presence. The Duel Arcane begins, but it is suddenly interrupted before the first spell can be summoned. One of Wencit's allies reveals himself to be another member of the Camberian Council, one who has been working to bring down Wencit for years for his own personal reasons. He provided poisoned wine for Wencit and his other allies, and all four are soon dying from its effects. Unwilling to let his enemies suffer needlessly, Kelson uses his powers to kill each of them. With Wencit's death, the Duel Arcane is ended and Kelson emerges victorious.
Reception.
Lester del Rey found the novel disappointing, saying that "the menaces have all turned into paper dragons" because the author has arbitrarily resolved the story's conflicts rather than working them out. He concluded that "In one novel the author has ruined everything [she] built up in the previous two."
Awards and nominations.
"High Deryni" was a finalist for the 1974 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for outstanding work in the field of fantasy literature. The other finalists were Susan Cooper's "The Dark Is Rising", Poul Anderson's "Hrolf Kraki's Saga", and Sanders Anne Laubenthal's "Excalibur". The winner of the award was "The Hollow Hills" by Mary Stewart, the sequel to "The Crystal Cave", which won the same award in 1971 over Kurtz' first novel, "Deryni Rising". Kurtz and Anderson had also been finalists the previous year, but Anderson would eventually win the award in 1975 for "A Midsummer Tempest".

Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival

The Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival, more commonly known as Cinemalaya, is a film festival in the Philippines held annually during the month of August, traditionally at the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex, but in recent years the Festival screenings also extend to various cinemas. Its aim is the development and promotion of Filipino independent films. The film festival is organized by the Cinemalaya Foundation, Inc. with the support of the Cultural Center of the Philippines and Econolink Investments, Inc.
Each year, the festival provides "seed investments" to the independent filmmakers who become the finalists of the festival's full-length category. In the beginning, the seed grant amounted to ₱500,000 (US$10,000~) per film. In 2019, it was increased to ₱1,000,000 (US$20,000~). In 2023, the Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP) matched this amount, bringing the total to ₱2,000,000 (US$40,000~). The finalists of the short film category received a total of ₱100,000 (US$1,785~) each for their finished films. These finalists are chosen from hundreds of submissions from all over the Philippines. Their films debut at the festival along with various out-of-competition works.
The organizing committee, headed by veteran Filipino director and actress Laurice Guillen, oversees the production of the films and the festival.
In 2023, the festival was held from August 4 to August 13, at the Philippine International Convention Center and in select mall cinemas.
The Festival.
The Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival is a film competition and festival that supports Filipino filmmakers. Each year, ten new filmmakers are given a seed grant in order to create their film. These films, along with ten short films under the Short Feature Category, are then featured in the film festival at the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) every August and compete for the Balanghai Award. An array of exhibition films are also shown at the CCP.
In addition to the screenings, the festival includes a variety of other film-related events such as book launches, talkbacks with filmmakers, and "Cinemalaya Conversations", where students and aspiring filmmakers talk to special guests about filmmaking and production. Also an integral part of the festival is the Cinemalaya Campus, a conference that looks at all aspects of independent filmmaking and distribution.
In 2010, the festival separated the full-length entries to two separate competitions: The Directors' Showcase and the New Breed section. The five feature-film entries competed under the Directors' Showcase which are presented by veteran film directors of the country. The other ten feature-film entries competed under the New Breed section, and are presented by first-time or young filmmakers. The Short Film section also had ten competing entries.
During the 2015 awards ceremony, The Cinemalaya Foundation announced that for its 12th edition there would two competitions: the main competition (Full Length Feature) and the short film features.

Double grave accent

The double grave accent () is a diacritic used in scholarly discussions of the Serbo-Croatian and sometimes Slovene languages. It is also used in the International Phonetic Alphabet.
In Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian, double grave accent is used to indicate a short falling tone, though in discussion of Slovenian, a single grave accent is also often used for this purpose. The double grave accent is found in both Latin and Cyrillic; however, it is not used in the everyday orthography of any language, only in discussions of phonology.
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the double grave accent is used to indicate extra-low tone.
The letters a, e, i, o, r, u, and their Cyrillic equivalents а, е, и, о, р, and у can all be found with the double grave accent. Unicode provides precomposed characters for the uppercase and the lowercase Latin letters but not the Cyrillic letters. The Cyrillic letters can be formed using the combining character for the double grave, . The combining character can also be used with IPA vowel symbols, if necessary.

Castel Capuano

Castel Capuano is a castle in Naples, southern Italy. It takes its name from the fact that it was at that point in the city walls where the road led out to the city of Capua. The castle is at the southwest end of via dei Tribunali, and until recently housed the Naples Hall of Justice, which has now moved to the new Civic Center, the "Centro Direzionale".
The structure was built in the 12th century by William I, the son of Roger II of Sicily, the first monarch of the Kingdom of Naples. It was expanded by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen and became one of his royal palaces. On 19 August 1432, Sergianni Caracciolo was stabbed by four knights in the service of the Queen in his room in Castel Capuano.
In the 16th century, under the Spanish viceroyship of Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, all of the city's various legal offices and departments were consolidated here and it became the Hall of Justice - known as the "Vicaria" - the basements of which served as a prison. Over the entrance to the castle, the arms of Emperor Charles V, who visited Naples in 1535, are still visible.
The castle has undergone many restorations, one as recent as 1860, and no longer retains much of its original appearance. The Colonna della Vicaria, a simple column on a pillar, once stood in front of the entrance; it was used to disgrace and punish debtors. At the rear exterior of the building, facing Piazza Enrico de Nicola, is the Fontana del Formiello.

<doc id="7027533" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7027533" title="Spencer (surname)">
Spencer (surname)

Spencer (also Spenser) is a surname, representing the court title "dispenser", or steward. An early example is Robert d'Abbetot, who is listed as Robert le Dispenser ('the steward'), a tenant-in-chief of several counties, in the Domesday Book of 1086. In early times, the surname was usually written as "le Despenser", "Dispenser" or "Despencer"—notably in works such as the Domesday Book and the Scottish Ragman Rolls of 1291 and 1296, but gradually lost both the "le" article and the unstressed first syllable of the longer surname to become Spencer.
As an occupational surname, Despenser/Spencer families would have originated in a range of different jurisdictions, and the possession of the shared surname is not an indication of genealogical relationship. The surname Spencer has gained in frequency over time. In the 19th century it also become popular as a given name—especially in the more anglicised areas of the United States.
Variations.
English.
In its transition from the French to its current form, the name "Spencer" has been presented and spelled in many ways—especially through the period of its early evolution in the medieval period from to 1350 CE. The following (in alphabetical order) is a selection of the many orthographic variants:
"Despencer", "de Expansa" (derived from ), "De Spencer", "de Spendure", "de Spens", "de la Despense", "De la Spence", "de la Spense", "del Spens", "Despenser", "DeSpenser", "Dispencer", "Dispenser", "Despensator", "Dispensator", "la Spens, le Despencer", "le Despendur", "le Despencer", "le Despenser", "le ", "le Espencer", "le Espenser", "le Spencer", "le Spendur", "Spendure", "le Spenser", "le Spensier", "Spence", "Spences, Spen, Spens", "Spensar," "Spense", "Spenser", "Spensers", "Spensor", "Spincer", also the rare patronymic "Spencers", and the aphetic (derived) "Spender".
The surnames "Stewart" and "Stuart" denote essentially the same occupation but have a completely different word derivation. They originate from the pre-7th-century English words a compound of meaning 'household', and , meaning 'guardian'.
Other countries and cultures.
Foreign equivalents:
Etymology.
The name "Spencer" can be traced through its Latin and French roots to its Middle English and modern form.
Noteworthy Despenser and Spencer families.
Robert Despenser.
Robert d'Abbetot was granted titles, lands and a high position in William's court. In addition to his position as steward, he also was given land grants in county Bedford. He held his office for the period c.1088–1098.
In England, Robert was best known by his occupation, and hence became known as Robert le Despenser (many spelling variants of this name exist including Robert the Dispensor, Robert Despensator, Robert Dispenser), which reflected his new official position, of using a patronymic, as Robert fitzThurstin. He seems to have maintained his favor with William because in the Domesday Book of 1086, Robert Despenser was listed as a land tenant-in-chief in Gloucestershire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire, and Warwickshire, as well as holding lands in Worcestershire obtained from the Bishop of Worcester.
Robert is assumed to have died shortly after restoring some estates to Westminster Abbey but he appears to have had no legitimate male children, as his heir was his brother Urse d'Abetot. He may have had a daughter, as some of his lands were inherited by the Marmion family, but it is also possible that a daughter of Urse married into the Marmion family. Robert's office as the king's steward may also have gone to Urse, as it was later held by Urse's heirs. Subsequent bearers of the Despenser or Spencer surname would not descend from Robert.
King's Dispensers.
The steward of William II of England was Thurstan, "Dispensator Regis" (royal steward). His son Hugh was "Dispensator Regis" in 1105 under Henry I, and was followed by his son or brother, Simon, "Dispensator Regis" for Henry and Stephen. Simon was father of a second Thurstan, who was active in the 1250s under Henry II, to be followed by his son Walter as "Dispensator Regis". Walter was succeeded by his brother Aymer, "Dispensator Regis" under king John, and Aymer's son Thurstan le Despenser, who served under Henry III, dying in 1249. He was followed by a son, Adam le Despenser, who was summoned by Edward I of England to perform military service and in 1283 to attend on the king in what was a precursor to the first royally-convened Parliament. His heir was a son, Aymer le Despenser, but he alienated his lands and titles during the reign of Edward II.
Lords Despencer.
In the early 13th century, a family that had been stewards to the Earls of Chester rose to prominence. Hugh le Despenser (died 1238) became High Sheriff of Berkshire, and his son, Hugh became "Justiciar" of England and was summoned in 1264 to the Parliament of Simon de Montfort as Lord Despencer. His son also named Hugh was created Earl of Winchester, while a descendant was made Earl of Gloucester. The family experienced a number of attainders, restorations, and creations of new lordships over the 13th and 14th centuries, with a claim to the last creation passing by marriage to the Wentworth family in the 15th century. The initial establishment was brought out of abeyance in favour of a female-line descendant in 1604, from which time the title of Baron le Despencer has descended to the current Viscount Falmouth.
Spencer aristocracy.
The English aristocratic Spencer family has resided at their ancestral home at Althorp, Northamptonshire, since the early 16th century. The Estate now covers in Northamptonshire, Warwickshire and Norfolk. From pre-Tudor times the Spencers had been farmers, coming to prominence in Warwickshire in the 15th century when John Spencer became feoffee of Wormleighton in 1469, and a tenant at Althorp in 1486. His nephew, another John, used the gains from trade in livestock and commodities to buy both properties. He was knighted in 1504 and died in 1522. John's descendants expanded the family holdings through business dealings and marriage into the peerage. The family is related through marriage to the Churchills of Blenheim Palace, a line that included the Dukes of Marlborough and Winston Churchill. From the Althorp line came the Earls of Sunderland, the later Dukes of Marlborough, and the Earls Spencer. The family captured international attention when Lady Diana Frances Spencer married Prince Charles on 29 July 1981, until her death in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997.
Heraldry.
The varied origins of people with the Spencer and Despenser surnames means that they are not all members of the same family, and each individual family would have distinct coats of arms, while most Spencers are not entitled to bear any arms. The family of the King's Dispensers bore an "ermine" shield with "chief" of unknown "tincture". The Lords Despencer bore arms from the early days of heraldry, which are one of a family of quarterly arms seen among the vassals of the Earls of Chester. Scholars have suggested a possible derivation from those of the Dutton family, or from the family of their one-time feudal overlords, Beauchamp of Bedford, whose own arms belonged to a shared group of similar bearings among Mandeville and Vere family vassals and descendants. They are described in the language of heraldry as "quarterly: 1st &amp; 4th, Argent; 2nd &amp; 3rd, Gules a fret or, over all a bend sable". In 1504, John Spencer of Althorp was granted for himself and his brother the arms: "azure, a fess ermine between six sea-mews' heads erased argent", and in 1564 a descendant of his uncle was granted: "sable, on a fess or, between 3 bezants, as many lions heads of the first". As the end of the century approached, however, the family's growing social status would lead them to adopt a forged pedigree that gave them an ancient derivation, and they began using new arms that represented a claimed kinship with the (actually entirely unrelated) Lords Despencer, modifying the earlier family's quarterly arms by the addition of three "escallops" (scallop shells). Numerous variations of this differenced coat, along with various Spencer arms bearing no resemblance to those of the Lords le Despenser, have been catalogued.
Distribution and spread.
The greatest density of Spencers in present-day England is in Nottinghamshire, followed by Derbyshire. Derby and Notts were closely connected at the time of Domesday, and up until the time of Elizabeth I had the same Sheriff.
In North America early settlement of Spencers date to Thomas Spencer in Virginia in 1623; William Spencer, Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1630; Thomas Spencer, Maine 1630. Col. Nicholas Spencer arrived in Virginia in the 1650s and subsequently served as Acting Governor.
Spencers arriving in Australia with the convicts of the First Fleet in 1788 were Daniel Spencer from Dorchester, John Spencer, and Mary Spence from Wigan. With the Third Fleet in 1791 came John Spencer from Lancaster and Thomas Spencer from London.

In spite of the name, the portal is not the ancient gateway to the "decumanus maximus", the main east-west road that once led out of Roman Naples to Capua. When the city was extended eastwards in the 15th century as part of the construction of the new Aragonese city walls, the original gate, which had been closer to the castle of the same name, Castel Capuano, was rebuilt and relocated in 1484. Then when the walls were razed, the gate remained free-standing, giving it somewhat the air of a triumphal arch. The carving on the 1484 facings consists of classically inspired trophies, flying Victories and other triumphal imagery. Just inside the gate, is the domed church of Santa Caterina a Formiello.

Scott Howie

Scott Howie (born 4 January 1972) is a Scottish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Having played professionally in the English and Scottish football leagues, he last played for English non-league side Wroxham.
Howie played for local non-league side Ferguslie United before joining Clyde in 1991, continuing to study for his Business Degree. He graduated with a BA from Strathclyde Business School in July 1994. Howie was capped by Scotland under-21s while with Clyde, making his debut against Malta and also appearing for Clyde later the same day. He also helped Clyde to the Scottish Second Division Championship.
In August 1993 he was sold to Norwich City for a fee of £300,000, but made just two first team appearances, both while regular goalkeeper Bryan Gunn was suspended. He was however a substitute for the UEFA Cup games against Vitesse Arnhem, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan.
With first team opportunities limited, Howie moved to Motherwell in October 1994, again costing £300,000. His form with Motherwell resulted in call-ups to the full Scotland team, although he never appeared at full international level. With Motherwell suffering financial problems, Howie refused to sign a new contract, restricting him from playing for a few months.
He joined Coventry City on loan in January 1998 and finally left Motherwell to join Reading for a fee of £30,000 on transfer deadline day in March 1998. Reading were relegated at the end of the season, but Howie remained with them until being released at the end of the 2000–2001 season.
In July 2001 he joined Bristol Rovers and was their player of the year the following season. Despite this, he was released in May 2003 at the end of the following season. He had a successful trial with Exeter City in July 2003, but failed to agree personal terms.
He joined Shrewsbury Town in August 2003 and played in the final of the 2004 Conference play-offs. The match went to penalties, and Howie saved three of the spot-kicks as The Shrews won promotion back to the Football League at the first attempt. At the end of the 2004–05 season, Howie was one of only two players, the other being Stuart Whitehead, to be offered a new contract by Shrewsbury manager Gary Peters. However, he was subsequently released and was on trial with Boston United in July 2005.
However, he joined Conference side Cambridge United in August 2005, where he played under the management of his former Norwich team-mate Rob Newman. He retired in the May 2006, with the Cambridge Evening News reporting on 10 May 2006 that he had retired to concentrate on his tax consultancy business.
On retiring he agreed to make himself available as cover for Cambridge's goalkeepers. In April 2007 he joined King's Lynn. He was cover for regular King's Lynn keeper Paul Crichton the following season, but played as first choice goalkeeper during the 2008–09 season.
In June 2009 Howie joined Wroxham, playing at Wembley for them as they lost 6–1 to Whitley Bay in the FA Vase Final in May 2010.
Scott is a coach at Cringleford Junior Football Club, and has played for Wroxham alongside this coaching role

Virginia State Route 38

State Route 38 (SR 38) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. Known for most of its length as Five Forks Road, SR 38 runs from U.S. Route 360 Business (US 360 Business) in Amelia Court House east to SR 153 at Scotts Fork.
Route description.
SR 38 begins at an intersection with US 360 Business (Goodes Bridge Road) in Amelia Court House. In Amelia, SR 38 makes a stairstep series of single-block right-angle turns at the courthouse square: It heads south on Virginia Street, turns east onto Court Street, turns south onto Washington Street to follow the east side of the courthouse property, turns east onto Church Street, and turns south onto Five Forks Road, passing Amelia Academy. One mile south of Church Street, at Amelia County High School, SR 38 turns east, at a junction formerly called Five Forks. From this intersection, SR 614 runs northwest as Otterburn Road and south as Dennisville Road; and SR 38, still named Five Forks Road, heads east through countryside for 5.9 miles to SR 153 (Military Road) at Scotts Fork. Scotts Fork marks the eastern terminus of SR 38, but the roadway continues east as SR 602 (Bevils Bridge Road) into Chesterfield County toward Petersburg.
History.
SR 38 follows a portion of the route taken by Confederate general Robert E. Lee and his army in their retreat westward during the final days of the Civil War. Confederate forces, hoping to reach a promised delivery of desperately needed rations at the Court House rail depot, had just fought an inconclusive battle at Namozine Church on April 3, 1865. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox on April 9.
All of SR 38, plus extensions east to Sutherland and northwest to Tobaccoville, was State Route 406 before the 1933 renumbering. At that time, SR 38 was assigned to the piece from Amelia Court House east to Sutherland; Amelia Court House to Tobaccoville became part of State Route 49. In the 1940 renumbering, SR 49 was greatly truncated, and SR 38 was extended northwest over former SR 49 to Tobaccoville. SR 38 east of the south junction with SR 153, a section deemed of "little primary significance", was transferred to the secondary system in 1951 as SR 708; the rest of SR 38 east of Amelia Court House became an extension of SR 153. However, later that year, the SR 38 designation was restored to the piece from Amelia Court House to the SR 153/SR 708 junction, and SR 153 was rerouted to go north from Scotts Fork to US 360. The overlap with SR 153 has since been removed. The piece of SR 38 from Tobaccoville via Morven to Amelia Court House became SR 681 in 1954.

Toe cleavage

Toe cleavage is the partial exposure of toes in shoes that are cut low enough at the vamp. Low cut shoes reveal toe cleavage similar to how low cut tops reveal breast cleavage.
Toe cleavage was considered to be fashionable in 2005 by stylists such as Susan Conterno, columnist for "FAMOUS" magazine. Manolo Blahnik himself opined that "the secret of toe cleavage, a very important part of the sexuality of the shoe" is that "You must only show the first two cracks.". In an "InStyle" magazine article, Samuel Ogden writes about the low cut angle in the bend of the shoe cover, stating that the curve creates a balance between the skin of the lower foot and the beginning of the toes.
Shoe designer Christian Louboutin takes a more provocative view of toe cleavage and states, "The point is, it's more provocative to show a low toe cleavage than it is wearing sandals that reveal all. In flip-flops you see everything but that is not at all sexy." He takes this further by relating, "The curved inside part of the foot, the instep, is the most sexy part so I like to close the heel and reveal the arch." "According to fashion insiders, "toe-cleavage shoes "sans" stockings" are part of the "unwritten dress code" of the "Voguette", as dictated by the magazine's longtime editor in chief Anna Wintour – "even in the bitter New York winter".
Fashion advice also centers around the amount of appropriate toe cleavage. A pump (court shoe) with a "slightly low vamp for a "hint" of toe cleavage" should not be "too racy for a conservative office". Financial guru Suze Orman says it is "the only cleavage that should be shown around an office".
The implied sexual aspects also come into play for some. Dominatrix Claudia Varrin references the attraction to "stiletto pumps with the low vamp" that allow "lots of toe cleavage". American lingerie brand Frederick's of Hollywood has promoted open-toe shoes as "sexually suggestive" due to the toe cleavage.

Rosemount, County Westmeath

Rosemount, historically called Ballybrickoge (), is a village in County Westmeath, Ireland. It is located 5 km northeast of the town of Moate.
History.
Located close to the southwest border of the ancient Barony of Moycashel, Rosemount was once a stronghold of a prominent branch of the Geoghegan (Mag Eochagain) sept of the Southern UI Neill. Like other Geoghegans in Moycashel, and wider Westmeath, they lost most of their prized grazing land and lake fisheries to the Cromwellian and Williamite settlers (both undertakers and officers) after the Down Survey. Many of the Geoghegan family ancestors are interred in the mortuary chapel at Kill.
In 1932 Harvard Archaeological Society excavated a Bronze Age cairn (cemetery) with the remains of 44 graves from the sixth century on top of Knockastia (or "Cnoc Aiste"), which at 200 m (656 ft) is one of the highest points in County Westmeath.
Amenities.
Rosemount village consists of a pub, primary school, church and community centre. The community committee holds a harvest fair every year (weather permitting). The national school has been renovated with the addition of a new play yard, three new classrooms, a new computer room and a gym. Rosemount's GAA club has won 9 senior county titles, and are one of the most successful clubs in Westmeath.
Music industry.
Rosemount has a recording studio called Grouse Lodge where musicians such as Paddy Casey, Morrissey, Muse, Snow Patrol, Bloc Party, REM, Shirley Bassey, Stereophonics, The Thrills, Westlife and the Manic Street Preachers have recorded. Rosemount and Grouse Lodge appeared on the US entertainment show Access Hollywood in November 2006, featuring an on-site interview with Michael Jackson who spent five months there recording a new album.
Sport.
A book detailing the history of Rosemount G.A.A. and District was published in 1989, "The Black and Amber Story". Many individuals from the parish have played for Westmeath, and the club has nine Westmeath Senior Football Championship titles. As a rural club, the development of young players has traditionally been important and this has resulted in a large number of successes in under-age finals, particularly in the 1970s.
After a 16-year spell out of the senior grade, which they won last in 1989, Rosemount won the Westmeath Intermediate Football Championship in 2016, and returned to the senior competition in 2017.
The Rose Of Tralee.
In 2022, The Westmeath Rose of Tralee Rachel Duffy was of native of Rosemount, Rachel represented the county in Tralee, Rachel was chosen as the winner, becoming the first Westmeath rose to win, and the first rose since the COVID-19 pandemic.

James Galante

James Galante (born January 5, 1953) is an American convicted felon and associate of the Genovese crime family, owner of the defunct Danbury Trashers minor-league hockey team and a defunct racecar team fielding cars for Ted Christopher, and ex-CEO of Automated Waste Disposal (AWD), a company that holds waste disposal contracts for most of western Connecticut and Westchester and Putnam counties in New York.
In June 2008, Galante admitted to charges of racketeering, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and defrauding the Internal Revenue Service, and faced between five and seven years in prison under Federal Sentencing Guidelines, and was also forced to forfeit his controlling interest in 25 different garbage-related businesses, estimated to be worth over $100 million. He was released in 2014 after serving seven years in prison.
Automated Waste Disposal (AWD).
Galante was owner of 25 different trash disposal businesses based out of Danbury, Connecticut and estimated to be worth over $100 million. The businesses handled 80 percent of garbage hauling in southern and western Connecticut, and Westchester and Putnam counties in New York. Since 1993, they have been accused of muscling out local competition through no-bid-contracts and payments of up to $120,000 per year to Genovese crime family boss Matthew "Matty the Horse" Ianniello. As a result, municipalities, businesses and residents paid artificially inflated carting prices for years. In 1999, Galante was sentenced to 12 months and a day in federal prison after pleading guilty to tax evasion.
Investigation and indictment.
In 2006, federal authorities infiltrated Automated Waste Disposal with an undercover agent and taped hours of phone conversations, precipitating a raid on AWD offices in Danbury and Galante's home in New Fairfield, Connecticut, acquiring trailers full of documents. In June 2006, Galante was issued a 98-count indictment describing Galante as a man who ran an illegal enterprise by carving up the garbage business in western Connecticut and Putnam County and using mob muscle to strong-arm any competitors who might get in his way. Among those also indicted as a result of the investigation were former Waterbury Mayor Joseph Santopietro, former Division Manager for Diversified Waste and Genovese Crime Family enforcer Robert Taggett, federal Drug Enforcement Agent Louis Angioletti, several of Galante's underlings and former Danbury Trashers hockey coach H. Todd Stirling.
Galante was charged in 93 counts of the indictment, with various alleged violations of federal law, including racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, Hobbs Act extortion, mail and wire fraud, witness tampering, tax fraud and conspiracy charges. The indictment included allegations that Galante and others conspired to commit arson and kidnapping by damaging a truck owned by one of Galante's competitors and by kidnapping the driver of that truck at gunpoint.
As the 33 men involved in the case were summarily indicted and tried, authorities confirmed Ianniello was paid a quarterly "mob tax" of $30,000 for his services, and like almost every other defendant in the case, the bagman responsible for delivering the money and Ianniello pleaded guilty, Ianniello to racketeering and interfering with a federal grand jury probe with a sentence of between one and a half to two years in prison. Galante was indicted in 2006 on charges of paying a 'mob tax' to Ianniello.
Plea and sentencing.
Although he initially entered a plea of not guilty, in June 2008, Galante agreed to a change-of-plea hearing. Galante acknowledged that he defrauded the IRS, including writing double paychecks for some employees and having them return one of them to him in cash, claiming items he purchased for his girlfriend's horse farm including hay and a wide-screen television as business expenses, and skimming cash from the register at the Danbury garbage transfer station.
Galante also agreed to forfeit his stake in 25 trash hauling and recycling companies to the federal government, and promised to never work in the business again, stating to the judge that he agreed to "withdraw" from involvement "with any segment of the trash industry in the United States." The 25 trash-disposal companies owned by Galante, all based in Danbury and estimated by him to be worth $100 million, were "condemned and forfeited to the United States of America." The businesses were sold, with the money going to the United States Department of the Treasury, under laws allowing the forfeiture of property obtained through criminal activities.
The government sold the companies, estimated to be worth $100 million, on the condition that the government would return $10.75 million to Galante as a portion of his share of more than $40 million in loans he and his wife made to the businesses over the years, and Galante would keep EnviroServices Inc., a waste collection, transfer, and disposal business in Virginia, with subsidiaries in Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Kentucky. Galante was initially paid only $7.6 million. After claims that the government violated the plea agreement, Galante was given the remaining $3.1 million.
Galante also agreed to forfeit a horse farm he bought for a former girlfriend, six racing cars, a racing trailer, and $448,000 in cash that federal agents seized in 2006, and to pay at least $1.6 million in back taxes to the IRS. He did not admit to other acts of which federal authorities accused him, including extortion, attempted arson, and kidnapping.
Danbury Trashers.
In June 2006, 29 people, including Galante, former Trashers' coach Todd Stirling, and Ianniello were indicted for defrauding the United Hockey League. Stirling and Galante allegedly violated the UHL's $275,000 per team salary cap by giving several players and their wives no-show jobs with AWD and hiding illegitimate payments as housing allowances. Stirling also faced six counts of wire fraud related to the filing of fraudulent weekly salary cap reports. According to the indictment, the Trashers' real payroll was nearly $750,000. Amidst these allegations, the Trashers suspended operations and released their players. In June 2008, Galante pleaded guilty to these charges. In a separate incident, in December 2004, Galante was charged with assaulting a UHL official during a game between the Trashers and the Kalamazoo Wings.
Putnam Victory Fund.
Galante was accused of donating to a PAC (Political Action Committee) which laundered money to several politicians who may have used their influence to award contracts to Galante's trash hauling business. Former State Assemblyman Willis Stephens, who also served as the legal counsel to the town of Southeast, New York, accepted over $9,000 from Galante. On Stephens' recommendation, the town board then awarded a $1.5 million no-bid garbage contract to Galante's company. The investigation culminated with raids of Putnam County Executive Robert Bondi's office, although no charges were ever filed.
Louis DeLuca scandal.
In 2007, Former Connecticut State Senate Minority Leader Louis DeLuca pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges in connection with Galante. DeLuca had asked Galante to threaten the husband of DeLuca's granddaughter, whom DeLuca believed was being abused. DeLuca also accepted large donations from Galante and his associates and allegedly promised to look out for Galante's interests. As of November 2007, a State Senate Committee was considering an appropriate sanction for DeLuca. Other Connecticut politicians, including Connecticut U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, received campaign funds raised by Galante, but had not been linked to any actions on Galante's behalf. On November 13, 2007, DeLuca cut the investigation short by announcing his resignation from the State Senate.

James W. Tate

James William Tate (30 July 1875 – 5 February 1922) was an English songwriter, accompanist, composer and producer of revues and pantomimes in the early years of the 20th century.
After working in the for five years, in 1897 Tate became Musical Director at the Carl Rosa Opera Company and then at Wyndham's Theatre. In 1898 he toured as the conductor for Lottie Collins, whom he married in 1902. After Lottie Collins's death in 1910, Tate married Clarice Mayne in 1912; he had been her accompanist since 1906. He composed numerous music hall songs during these years, and had songs interpolated in shows.
Julian Wylie formed a partnership with Tate, creating and producing pantomimes and revues just before the First World War, as well as musicals such as "High Jinks" (1916). He continued to write the music for popular songs, including several in "The Maid of the Mountains" and sometimes full scores for shows such as "The Beauty Spot" (1917). Wylie and Tate continued to produce revues and pantomimes, while Tate continued to write songs. The Wylie-Tate company continued through the 1920s and into the 1930s despite Tate's death, and Wylie continued to use Tate's music in further shows.
Life and career.
Tate was born in Wolverhampton, England, the son of a publican. He was the eldest brother of one of the foremost operatic sopranos of the early twentieth century, Maggie Teyte. Originally intending to pursue a career in the church, he received early music training from his father, composing his first piece at the age of ten. 
Early career.
In 1892, Tate went to the United States, returning in 1897 to accept a position as Musical Director at the Carl Rosa Opera Company. Later, Tate served as Musical Director at Wyndham's Theatre. In 1898 Tate went on tour as conductor with the dancer-singer Lottie Collins, who was famous for introducing the song "Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay" to Britain. He married Collins in 1902, becoming her second husband. She was the mother of musical comedy star Jose Collins. In 1902, he managed a production with a title similar to that of the Parisian hit play "Coralie et Cie" at the Islington Grand called "The Court Dressmaker, or Coralie and Co". This led to legal action in the High Court by the producers of 'The Little French Milliner', an adaptation of the same French play at The Avenue theatre; the dispute was settled by an agreement to alter the title of Tate's play. In 1903 he toured as conductor with the musical "All at Sea". 
After Lottie Collins's death in 1910, Tate married singer Clarice Mayne in 1912, with whom he had been performing since 1906. Tate was her accompanist, and was the "That" in the variety theatre act known as "Clarice Mayne and That" ("This sings, That Plays!"). Tate was a composer of numerous catchy music hall songs during these years, many for his wife. He also had songs interpolated in shows, including "Sergeant Brue" (1904, "Instinct", "And so did Eve") and "The Belle of the Orient" (1904).
World War I years.
The producer Julian Wylie saw Tate and Mayne's act and formed a partnership with Tate. They began to specialize in creating and producing pantomimes and revues just before the First World War, including "I Should Worry" at the Palace Theatre (1913), the Victoria Palace's "A Year in an Hour" (1914), "Very Mixed Bathing" (1915), "Kiss Me, Sergeant" (1915), "The Passing Show" (1915), and "High Jinks" (1916). Tate co-wrote the successful "Samples" (1916) with Herman Darewski and Irving Berlin, including the hit song, "A Broken Doll." The Vaudeville Theatre revue "Some" included his successful song, "Ev'ry little while" (1916). Tate also wrote song hits such as "The rain came pitter patter pown," "A tiny seed," "Come over the Garden Wall," and "I was a good little girl till I met you" (all in 1914), and "Give me a little cosy corner" (1918).
In 1916 Tate composed four songs, including three that became hits ("My life is love", "A bachelor gay am I", and "A paradise for two"), for inclusion in what became a record-breaking show, "The Maid of the Mountains". This commission arose at the suggestion of the show's star, Tate's step daughter Jose Collins, after initial previews indicated that the original score needed strengthening. Lyrics to these songs where supplied by his regular lyricists Frank Clifford Harris and "Valentine" (Archibald Thomas Pechey), who were to write the lyrics of many of Tate's songs throughout his career. "A bachelor gay" became one of the most popular baritone songs in the British concert repertoire. Tate subsequently wrote the score for more revues and pantomimes, including the revusical "The Lads of the Village" (1917), and another revue-musical, "The Beauty Spot" (1917), created for Regine Flory and produced by Parisian revue specialist P-L Flers at the Gaiety Theatre, London.
Later years.
Wylie and Tate concentrated on pantomime after World War I, introducing shows such as "Any Lady" (1918), "The Follies of 1919" (which was repeated in each subsequent year) and "Mr Manhattan" (1919), "The Whirl Of Today" (1920), "Aladdin" (1920), and many shows at the London Hippodrome, including "The Peep Show" (1921), 1921 "Swindells Stores", "Round In Fifty" (1922, with Herman Finck, based on "Around the World in 80 Days"), "Brighter London" (1923) and "Better Days" (1925).
In his last years, Tate continued to produce popular songs, such "Somewhere in France with you," "Give Me a Cosy Little Corner," but he never wrote for another "book" musical. His death cut short a very productive career. The Wylie-Tate company continued through the 1920s and into the 1930s despite Tate's death, and Wylie continued to use Tate's music in pantomimes during this period, including several productions of "Cinderella", "Leap Year" (1924), "Mr Tickle M.P" (1924), "Who's My Father" (1924), "Turned Up" (1926), "Flyaway Peter" (1926, with Sophie Tucker), "The Apache" (1927 at The London Palladium), "Dancing Mad" (1927), "The Yellow Mask" (1928), "Mr. Cinders" (1929) at the Adelphi Theatre and "The Good Companions" at His Majesty’s Theatre (1931).
Tate died in Stoke-on-Trent suddenly at the age of 46, as a result of pneumonia caught while travelling the country with his touring revues. He is buried in Hampstead Cemetery.

List of governors of the Duchy of Milan

The governor of Milan was a political and military office of the Duchy of Milan, the title of the representatives of the foreign sovereigns who held dominion over the Milanese area, substantially from the 16th century until the Unification of Italy. The first Spanish Governor was appointed after the death of the last Duke of the House of Sforza, Francesco II.
Sforza's final years.
The figure of the Governor of Milan had already been established in 1526, following the Battle of Pavia and the passage of the duchy from the Kingdom of France, which invaded the Duchy in 1499, to the Sforza, no more as an independent state as it was during the centuries old rule of the Milanese dynasties, but now under the protection of Charles V.
Spanish rule (1556–1706).
Milan fell to the Austrian army on September 26, 1706 during the War of the Spanish Succession. The Austrian rule was confirmed by the Treaty of Rastatt.
Austrian rule (1706–1800).
The Austrians abandoned Milan after the Battle of Marengo and the duchy was incorporated again in the Cisalpine Republic, which became the Italian Republic in 1802 and the Kingdom of Italy in 1805. In 1814 the Austrians retook Milan and, joined to the former Republic of Venice, it was formed into a new kingdom, the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, ruled by Austrian-appointed viceroys.

Forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye

The Forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye or "Forêt de Saint-Germain-en-Laye", is a dominial forest of in area which lies in a meander of the River Seine, France. Situated West of Paris, between Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Maisons-Laffitte, Achères and Poissy, It is situated entirely within the commune of Saint-Germain. Essentially composed of oak (53%) and beech (18%), it is now a forest bordered by built up areas and divided by communication links: route nationales, A14 and the railway line from Paris to Caen.
The Fête des Loges is, every year, organised in an open space near Saint-Germain.
History.
The Forest of Laye is a relic of the ancient Forest of Yveline. Very early it became a royal domain and hunting grounds of the Kings of France who resided at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Henry IV and Louis XIII of France often used the forest for fox hunting. Louis XIV also walked the forest and hired an architect, André Le Nôtre, to build a terrace bordering the forest dominating the valley of the River Seine in 1663. He also built a high wall, finished by Napoléon, encircling the forest to prevent game from escaping the woods. After the abandonment of the forest of Saint-Germain in 1682 by Louis XIV, Charles X resumed the hunting tradition of Saint-Germain. Napoléon III purchased land to the South to link the forest of Saint-Germain with the Forest of Marly. The arrival of the railway in 1835, then the development of the car, considerably increased use of the forest.
Since the middle of the 19th century, the forest has lost of its surface area.

Live and Let Die (novel)

Live and Let Die is the second novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series of stories. Set in London, the United States and Jamaica, it was first published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1954. Fleming wrote the novel at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica before his first book, "Casino Royale", was published; much of the background came from Fleming's travel in the US and knowledge of Jamaica.
The story centres on Bond's pursuit of "Mr Big", a criminal who has links to the American criminal network, the world of voodoo and SMERSH—an arm of the Soviet secret service—all of which are threats to the First World. Bond becomes involved in the US through Mr Big's smuggling of 17th-century gold coins from British territories in the Caribbean. The novel deals with the themes of the ongoing East–West struggle of the Cold War, including British and American relations, Britain's position in the world, race relations, and the struggle between good and evil.
As with "Casino Royale", "Live and Let Die" was broadly well received by the critics. The initial print run of 7,500 copies quickly sold out and a second print run was ordered within the year. US sales, when the novel was released there a year later, were much slower. Following a comic strip adaptation in 1958–59 by John McLusky in the "Daily Express", the novel was adapted in 1973 as the eighth film in the Eon Productions Bond series and the first to star Roger Moore as Bond. Major plot elements from the novel were also incorporated into the Bond films "For Your Eyes Only" in 1981 and "Licence to Kill" in 1989.
Plot.
The British Secret Service agent James Bond is sent by his superior, M, to New York City to investigate "Mr Big", real name Buonaparte Ignace Gallia. Bond's target is an agent of the Soviet counterintelligence organisation SMERSH, and an underworld voodoo leader who is suspected of selling 17th-century gold coins to finance Soviet spy operations in America. These gold coins have been turning up in the Harlem section of New York City and in Florida and are suspected of being part of a treasure that was buried in Jamaica by the pirate Henry Morgan.
In New York, Bond meets up with his counterpart in the CIA, Felix Leiter. The two visit some of Mr Big's nightclubs in Harlem, but are captured. Bond is interrogated by Mr Big, who uses his fortune-telling employee, Solitaire (so named because she excludes men from her life), to determine if Bond is telling the truth. Solitaire lies to Mr Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr Big decides to release Bond and Leiter, and has one of Bond's fingers broken. On leaving, Bond kills several of Mr Big's men; Leiter is released with minimal physical harm by a gang member, sympathetic because of a shared appreciation of jazz.
Solitaire later leaves Mr Big and contacts Bond; the couple travel by train to St. Petersburg, Florida, where they meet Leiter. While Bond and Leiter are scouting one of Mr Big's warehouses used for storing exotic fish, Solitaire is kidnapped by Mr Big's minions. Leiter later returns to the warehouse by himself, but is either captured and fed to a shark or tricked into standing on a trap door over the shark tank through which he falls; he survives, but loses an arm and a leg. Bond finds him in their safe house with a note pinned to his chest "He disagreed with something that ate him". Bond then investigates the warehouse himself and discovers that Mr Big is smuggling gold coins by hiding them in the bottom of fish tanks holding poisonous tropical fish, which he is bringing into the US. He is attacked in the warehouse by "the Robber", Mr Big's gunman, and in the resultant gunfight Bond outwits the Robber and causes him to fall into the shark tank.
Bond continues his mission in Jamaica, where he meets a local fisherman, Quarrel, and John Strangways, the head of the local MI6 station. Quarrel gives Bond training in scuba diving in the local waters. Bond swims through shark- and barracuda-infested waters to Mr Big's island and manages to plant a limpet mine on the hull of his yacht before being captured once again by Mr Big. Bond is reunited with Solitaire; the following morning Mr Big ties the couple to a line behind his yacht and plans to drag them over the shallow coral reef and into deeper water so that the sharks and barracuda that he attracts in to the area with regular feedings will eat them.
Bond and Solitaire are saved when the limpet mine explodes seconds before they are dragged over the reef. Though temporarily stunned by the explosion and injured on the coral, they are protected from the explosion by the reef and Bond watches as Mr Big, who survived the explosion, is killed by the sharks and barracuda.
Background.
Between January and March 1952, the journalist Ian Fleming wrote "Casino Royale", his first novel, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. Fleming conducted research for "Live and Let Die", and completed the novel before "Casino Royale" was published in January 1953, four months before his second book was published. Fleming and his wife Ann flew to New York before taking the Silver Meteor train to St. Petersburg in Florida and then flying on to Jamaica. In doing so, they followed the same train route Fleming had taken with his friend Ivar Bryce in July 1943, when Fleming had first visited the island.
Once Fleming and his wife arrived at Goldeneye, he started work on the second Bond novel. In May 1963 he wrote an article for "Books and Bookmen" magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: "I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." As he had done with "Casino Royale", Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend, the writer William Plomer, who reacted favourably to the story, telling Fleming that "the new book held this reader like a limpet mine &amp; the denouement was shattering". On a trip to the US in May 1953, Fleming used his five-day travelling time on RMS "Queen Elizabeth" to correct the proofs of the novel.
Fleming intended the book to have a more serious tone than his debut novel, and he initially considered making the story a meditation on the nature of evil. The novel's original title, "The Undertaker's Wind", reflects this; the undertaker's wind, which was to act as a metaphor for the story, describes one of Jamaica's winds that "blows all the bad air out of the island".
The literary critic Daniel Ferreras Savoye considers the titles of Fleming's novels to have importance individually and collectively; "Live and Let Die", he writes, "turns an expression of collective wisdom, in this case fraternal and positive, into its exact opposite, suggesting a materialistic epistemological outlook, individualistic and lucid". This is in keeping with the storyline in that Bond brings order without which "the world would quickly turn into the dystopian, barbarian reality feared by [Thomas] Hobbes and celebrated by [Marquis] de Sade."
Although Fleming provided no dates within his novels, two writers have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom have written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications—put the events of "Live and Let Die" in 1952; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story to have taken place in January and February that year.
Development.
Plot inspirations.
Much of the novel draws from Fleming's personal experiences: the opening of the book, with Bond's arrival at New York's Idlewild Airport was inspired by Fleming's own journeys in 1941 and 1953, and the warehouse at which Leiter is attacked by a shark was based on a similar building Fleming and his wife had visited in St. Petersburg, Florida, on their recent journey. He also used his experiences on his two journeys on the Silver Meteor as background for the route taken by Bond and Solitaire.
Fleming used the names of some of his friends in the story, including Ivar Bryce for Bond's alias, and Tommy Leiter for Felix Leiter; He borrowed Bryce's middle name, Felix, for Leiter's first name, and part of John Fox-Strangways's surname for the name of the MI6 station chief in Jamaica. Fleming also used the name of the local Jamaican rufous-throated solitaire bird as the name of the book's main female character.
Fleming's experiences on his first scuba dive with Jacques Cousteau in 1953 provided much of the description of Bond's swim to Mr Big's boat. The concept of limpet-mining is possibly based on the wartime activities of the elite 10th Light Flotilla, a unit of Italian navy frogmen. Fleming also used, and extensively quoted, information about voodoo from his friend Patrick Leigh Fermor's 1950 book "The Traveller's Tree", which had also been partly written at Goldeneye.
Fleming had a long-held interest in pirates, from the novels he read as a child through to films such as "Captain Blood" (1935) with Errol Flynn, which he enjoyed watching. From his Goldeneye home on Jamaica's northern shore, Fleming had visited Port Royal on the south of the island, which was once the home port of Sir Henry Morgan, all of which stimulated Fleming's interest. For the background to Mr Big's treasure island, Fleming appropriated the details of Cabritta Island in Port Maria Bay, which was the true location of Morgan's hoard.
Characters.
Fleming builds the main character in "Live and Let Die" to make Bond come across as more human than in "Casino Royale", becoming "a much warmer, more likeable man from the opening chapter", according to the novelist Raymond Benson, who between 1997 and 2002 wrote a series of Bond novels and short stories. Savoye sees the introduction of a vulnerable side to Bond, identifying the agent's tears towards the end of the story as evidence of this. Similarly, over the course of the book, the American character Leiter develops and also emerges as a more complete and human character and his and Bond's friendship is evident in the story. Despite the relationship, Leiter is again subordinate to Bond. While in "Casino Royale" his role was to provide technical support and money to Bond, in "Live and Let Die" the character is secondary to Bond, and the only time he takes the initiative, he loses an arm and a leg, while Bond wins his own battle with the same opponent. Although Fleming had initially intended to kill Leiter off in the story, his American literary agent protested, and the character was saved.
Quarrel was Fleming's ideal concept of a black person, and the character was based on his genuine liking for Jamaicans, whom he saw as "full of goodwill and cheerfulness and humour". The relationship between Bond and Quarrel was based on a mutual assumption of Bond's superiority. Fleming described the relationship as "that of a Scots laird with his head stalker; authority was unspoken and there was no room for servility".
Fleming's villain was physically abnormal—as many of Bond's later adversaries were. Mr Big is described as being intellectually brilliant, with a "great football of a head, twice the normal size and very nearly round" and skin which was "grey-black, taut and shining like the face of a week-old corpse in the river". For Benson, "Mr Big is only an adequate villain", with little depth. According to the literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek, in his examination of 20th century British spy novels, "Live and Let Die" was a departure from the "gentleman crook" that appeared in much earlier literature, as the intellectual and organisational skills of Mr Big were emphasised, rather than the behavioural. Within Mr Big's organisation, Panek identifies Mr Big's henchmen as "merely incompetent gunsels" whom Bond can eliminate with relative ease.
Style.
Benson analysed Fleming's writing style and identified what he described as the "Fleming Sweep": a stylistic point that sweeps the reader from one chapter to another using 'hooks' at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next: Benson felt that the "Fleming Sweep never achieves a more engaging rhythm and flow" than in "Live and Let Die". The writer and academic Kingsley Amis—who also later wrote a Bond novel—disagrees, and thinks that the story has "less narrative sweep than most". Fleming's biographer, Matthew Parker, considers the novel possibly Fleming's best, as it has a tight plot and is well paced throughout; he thinks the book "establishes the winning formula" for the stories that follow.
Savoye, comparing the structure of "Live and Let Die" with "Casino Royale", believes that the two books have open narratives which allow Fleming to continue with further books in the series. Savoye finds differences in the structure of the endings, with "Live and Let Die"s promise of future sexual encounters between Bond and Solitaire to be more credible than "Casino Royale"s ending, in which Bond vows to battle a super-criminal organisation.
Within the novel Fleming uses elements that are "pure Gothic", according to the essayist Umberto Eco. This includes the description of Mr Big's death by shark attack, in which Bond watches as "Half of The Big Man's left arm came out of the water. It had no hand, no wrist, no wrist watch." Eco considers that this is "not just an example of macabre sarcasm; it is an emphasis on the essential by the inessential, typical of the ""." Benson considers that Fleming's experiences as a journalist, and his eye for detail, add to the verisimilitude displayed in the novel.
Themes.
"Live and Let Die", like other Bond novels, reflects the changing roles of Britain and America during the 1950s and the perceived threat from the Soviet Union to both nations. Unlike "Casino Royale", where Cold War politics revolve around British-Soviet tensions, in "Live and Let Die" Bond arrives in Harlem to protect America from Soviet agents working through the Black Power movement. In the novel, America was the Soviet objective and Bond comments "that New York 'must be the fattest atomic-bomb target on the whole face of the world'."
"Live and Let Die" also gave Fleming a chance to outline his views on what he saw as the increasing American colonisation of Jamaica—a subject that concerned both him and his neighbour Noël Coward. While the American Mr Big was unusual in appropriating an entire island, the rising number of American tourists to the islands was seen by Fleming as a threat to Jamaica; he wrote in the novel that Bond was "glad to be on his way to the soft green flanks of Jamaica and to leave behind the great hard continent of Eldollarado."
Bond's briefing also provides an opportunity for Fleming to offer his views on race through his characters. "M and Bond ... offer their views on the ethnicity of crime, views that reflected ignorance, the inherited racialist prejudices of London clubland", according to the cultural historian Jeremy Black. Black also points out that "the frequency of his references and his willingness to offer racial stereotypes [was] typical of many writers of his age". The writer Louise Welsh observes that ""Live and Let Die" taps into the paranoia that some sectors of white society were feeling" as the civil rights movements challenged prejudice and inequality. That insecurity manifested itself in opinions shared by Fleming with the intelligence industry, that the American National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was a communist front. The communist threat was brought home to Jamaica with the 1952 arrest of the Jamaican politician Alexander Bustamante by the American authorities while he was on official business in Puerto Rico, despite the fact that he was avowedly anti-communist. During the course of the year local Jamaican political parties had also expelled members for being communists.
Friendship is another prominent element of "Live and Let Die", where the importance of male friends and allies shows through in Bond's relationships with Leiter and Quarrel. The more complete character profiles in the novel clearly show the strong relationship between Bond and Leiter, and this provides a strengthened motive for Bond to chase Mr Big in revenge for the shark attack on Leiter.
"Live and Let Die" continues the theme Fleming examined in "Casino Royale", that of evil or, as Fleming's biographer, Andrew Lycett, describes it, "the banality of evil". Fleming uses Mr Big as the vehicle to voice opinions on evil, particularly when he tells Bond that "Mister Bond, I suffer from boredom. I am prey to what the early Christians called 'accidie', the deadly lethargy that envelops those who are sated." This allowed Fleming to build the Bond character as a counter to the accidie, in what the writer saw as a Manichaean struggle between good and evil. Benson considers evil as the main theme of the book, and highlights the discussion Bond has with René Mathis of the French Deuxième Bureau in "Casino Royale", in which the Frenchman predicts Bond will seek out and kill the evil men of the world.
Publication and reception.
Publication history.
"Live and Let Die" was published in hardback by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1954 and, as with "Casino Royale", Fleming designed the cover, which again featured the title lettering prominently. It had an initial print run of 7,500 copies which sold out, and a reprint of 2,000 copies was soon undertaken; by the end of the first year, a total of over 9,000 copies had been sold. In May 1954 "Live and Let Die" was banned in Ireland by the Irish Censorship of Publications Board. Lycett observed that the ban helped the general publicity in other territories. In October 1957 Pan Books issued a paperback version which sold 50,000 copies in the first year.
"Live and Let Die" was published in the US in January 1955 by Macmillan; there was only one major change in the book, which was that the title of the fifth chapter was changed from "Nigger Heaven" to "Seventh Avenue". Sales in the US were poor, with only 5,000 copies sold in the first year of publication.
Critical reception.
Philip Day of "The Sunday Times" noted "How wincingly well Mr Fleming writes"; the reviewer for "The Times" thought that "[t]his is an ingenious affair, full of recondite knowledge and horrific spills and thrills—of slightly sadistic excitements also—though without the simple and bold design of its predecessor". Elizabeth L Sturch, writing in "The Times Literary Supplement", observed that Fleming was "without doubt the most interesting recent recruit among thriller-writers" and that "Live and Let Die" "fully maintains the promise of ... "Casino Royale"." Tempering her praise of the book, Sturch thought that "Mr Fleming works often on the edge of flippancy, rather in the spirit of a highbrow", although overall she felt that the novel "contains passages which for sheer excitement have not been surpassed by any modern writer of this kind". The reviewer for "The Daily Telegraph" felt that "the book is continually exciting, whether it takes us into the heart of Harlem or describes an underwater swim in shark-infested waters; and it is more entertaining because Mr Fleming does not take it all too seriously himself". George Malcolm Thompson, writing in "The Evening Standard", believed "Live and Let Die" to be "tense; ice-cold, sophisticated; Peter Cheyney for the carriage trade".
Writing in "The New York Times", Anthony Boucher—a critic described by Fleming's biographer, John Pearson, as "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—thought that the "high-spots are all effectively described ... but the narrative is loose and jerky". Boucher concluded that "Live and Let Die" was "a lurid meller contrived by mixing equal parts of Oppenheim and Spillane". In June 1955 the novelist Raymond Chandler was visiting the poet Stephen Spender in London when he was introduced to Fleming, who subsequently sent Chandler a copy of "Live and Let Die". In response, Chandler wrote that Fleming was "probably the most forceful and driving writer of what I suppose still must be called thrillers in England".
Adaptations.
"Live and Let Die" was adapted as a daily comic strip which was published in "The Daily Express" and syndicated around the world. The adaptation ran from 15 December 1958 to 28 March 1959. The adaptation was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky, whose drawings of Bond had a resemblance to Sean Connery, the actor who portrayed Bond in "Dr. No" three years later.
Before "Live and Let Die" had been published, the producer Alexander Korda had read a proof copy of the novel. He thought it was the most exciting story he had read for years, but was unsure whether it was suitable for a film. Nevertheless, he wanted to show the story to the directors David Lean and Carol Reed for their impressions, although nothing came of Korda's initial interest. In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel, "Casino Royale", Warner Bros. expressed an interest in "Live and Let Die", and offered $500 for an option, against $5,000 if the film was made. Fleming thought the terms insufficient and turned them down.
"Live and Let Die", a film based loosely on the novel, was released in 1973; it starred Roger Moore as Bond, and played on the cycle of blaxploitation films produced at the time. The film was directed by Guy Hamilton, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and is the eighth in the Eon Productions Bond series. Some scenes from the novel were depicted in later Bond films: Bond and Solitaire being dragged behind Mr Big's boat was used in "For Your Eyes Only"; Felix Leiter was fed to a shark in "Licence to Kill", which also adapts "Live and Let Die"s shoot-out in the warehouse.

Zsa Zsa Padilla

Esperanza "Zsa Zsa" Perez Padilla (born May 28, 1964) is a Filipino singer, actress, television host, music producer and businesswoman.
Referred to as the "Divine Diva", Padilla is recognized as one of the top female recording artists in the Philippines. Before going solo in 1982, Padilla began her career in the mid 70s with the Filipino band Hotdog. She has won a Gawad Urian Award, 2 FAP Awards, 3 Golden Screen Awards including the prestigious 'Decade Award' and received multiple nominations at the FAMAS Award. Padilla is also among the biggest-selling female music artists in the Philippines. According to Philippine Association of the Record Industry, some of her best-selling albums include: "Ikaw Lamang" (Gold), "Zsa Zsa" (4× Platinum), "Sentiments" (Platinum) and "Unchanging Love" (Gold). As an acclaimed actress, Padilla has played various genres ranging from drama, comedy and fantasy. She's best known for "ZsaZsa Zaturnnah Ze Moveeh", "Batang PX", "Ako Legal Wife: Mano Po 4" and "Minsan Lang Kitang Iibigin".
Career.
Padilla started in 1982 as the vocalist of the band Hotdog before going solo less than a year later in 1983. In 1987, she had her first TV acting role in the series, "Lovingly Yours, Helen". In the same year, she had her first film role in "Mga Anak ni Facifica Falayfay", with the Filipino comedian Dolphy, who became her partner of more than 20 years.
Personal life.
Family.
Padilla was born as Esperanza Perez Padilla in 1964, the daughter of parents Esperanza "Kating" Felipa Perez and actor-sportsman Carlos "Sonny" Padilla, Jr. In 1980, at the age of 16, she wedded her 35-year-old boyfriend Modesto Tatlonghari, a dentist, with whom she had one daughter, Karylle (born 1981).
Despite her initial marriage, Padilla became a partner to comedian Rodolfo "Dolphy" Quizon in 1988, having two children with him: Nicole (adopted 1991) and Zia Denise Marie (born 1992). In 2001, Padilla filed for the annulment of her marriage to Tatlonghari, with Dolphy, having never married before, expressing his dream of finally entering into marriage with Padilla once her annulment is granted. Her church wedding was annulled in 2004, while her civil wedding was annulled in May 2011; Tatlonghari was reported to have remained "civil" and "cordial" in his relationship with Padilla after the annulment. Padilla's marriage to Dolphy, however, would not push through due to negative public reaction toward her relationship, with Dolphy later passing away in July 2012.
In 2014, Padilla began a relationship with architect Conrad Onglao after being introduced to each other by singer Sharon Cuneta. Padilla and Onglao thus became live-in partners, with the two eventually deciding not to pursue marriage after Padilla went through another annulment process with a Japanese man she was unknowingly married to in 1992. The couple reside on a $6.8 million U-shaped mansion upon a 1,386 square-meter lot in Barangay San Lorenzo Village, while also owning a green holiday cottage called the Casa Esperanza in Lucban, Quezon.
Health concerns.
Padilla suffers from a birth defect, megaureter since her left ureter caused her chronic urinary tract infection. In 2007, her first surgery was a minimally invasive procedure to remedy the ureter. In 2012, Padilla underwent partial left kidney nephrectomy. In 2024, she had a (pee) reflux which caused her third surgery, a laparoscopy at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital.

The Great Britain men's national field hockey team participates in international field hockey tournaments such as the Summer Olympics and the FIH Pro League. The team won gold at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp and the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. The team won the 2017 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup.
In most other competitions, including the Hockey World Cup, the Commonwealth Games and some editions of the Hockey Champions Trophy, the four home nations compete in their own right: England, Ireland (includes both the Republic and Northern Ireland), Scotland and Wales.
The team was established in 1920 as Great Britain and Ireland, before the independence of most of Ireland as the Irish Free State. They only played one tournament under that name: the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, when they won the gold medal. Before 1920 there was only one field hockey tournament at the Olympics, in 1908, when England won the gold, Ireland the silver, and Scotland and Wales the bronze medals.

<doc id="7027797" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7027797" title="2001 European Le Mans Series">
2001 European Le Mans Series

The 2001 European Le Mans Series season was the only season for the IMSA European Le Mans Series. It is a series for Le Mans Prototypes (LMP) and Grand Touring (GT) race cars divided into 4 classes: LMP900, LMP675, GTS, and GT. It began 17 March 2001 and ended 6 October 2001 after 7 races.
The series came about following the expansion of Don Panoz's American Le Mans Series to include European rounds in 2000. The ELMS become a separate series for 2001, although following the same IMSA and ACO rules that the ALMS followed, and even having shared events among the two series. Like the Petit Le Mans for the ALMS, the 1000 km of Estoril was meant to be a unique event that would earn automatic entries to the 24 Hours of Le Mans for its winners. A lack of interest from the European racing community and competition from the FIA's series, meant that this would be the only season of ELMS. Another planned series, known as Asian-Pacific Le Mans Series (APLMS) was planned to begin in late 2001, but never occurred.
Following the demise of the European Le Mans Series, the ACO would attempt to create another European-based sportscar series in 2003 with the more successful Le Mans Endurance Series. The Le Mans Endurance Series was eventually renamed the European Le Mans Series in 2012.
History.
With the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) allowing Don Panoz to bring the rules and racing formulas of the 24 Hours of Le Mans to America with the creation of the Petit Le Mans in 1998, Don Panoz attempted to build up a series to be based around Petit Le Mans. The aged IMSA sportscar series was taken over and became the new American Le Mans Series, and met with much success in 1999. Following this success, Panoz attempting to bring sportscar racing back to Europe, which had lacked a major sportscar series since the demise of the World Sportscar Championship in 1992. This led to the 2000 American Le Mans Series season, which included two races in Europe as the Nürburgring and Silverstone Circuit, as well as a round in Australia. These races would serve as a precursor to what would become the separate European Le Mans Series in 2001.
The European Le Mans Series was launched for 2001 with 5 races, including a premier 1000 km race at Estoril, which would be the European equivalent of the 1000 mile Petit Le Mans and earn automatic entries to the 24 Hours of Le Mans for each class winner.
To aid in the development of the ELMS, the 2001 season shared some races between both ALMS and ELMS. The 12 Hours of Sebring and Petit Le Mans, normally ALMS races, were considered optional races for ELMS teams. At the same time, the ELMS races at Donington Park and Jarama were considered optional for ALMS teams. This allowed for the possibility of boosting the draw from international teams to either series.
Unfortunately the series was unable to earn much attention from European sportscar teams, especially since the final FIA Sportscar Championship and FIA GT Championship series used similar cars, but different rules which would require teams to modify their cars or buy new cars to comply with ELMS rules. This means that the car count for the 2001 season was small. For the ELMS events that included ALMS teams, very few teams actually bothered to make the trip across the Atlantic to participate in races that appeared to have very few serious competitors. Of the ALMS teams that did race, nearly all were factory backed squads that had the money to spend on transporting their equipment to Europe. Thus the entry lists for each race fell from 25 at the beginning of the season to a mere 14 at season's end, with some classes only having one or two competitors.
With a lack of involvement from teams, and less interest from the media due to the lack of teams, the European Le Mans Series was forced to fold following the 2001 season.
The demise of the European Le Mans Series would not be the end of sportscar racing in Europe. In 2003, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest announced their intentions to create their own European-based series, named the Le Mans Endurance Series, which would be similar to the European Le Mans Series, but feature only 1000 km races instead of the shorter, 2 Hour 45 Minute races used by ELMS. This series would be far more successful, with a large number of participants from the very beginning.
APLMS.
At the same time in the development of the European Le Mans Series, Don Panoz also proposed the idea of yet another series. Originally named the Asian Le Mans Series, it was later known as the Asian-Pacific Le Mans Series (APLMS). Like the European Le Mans Series, this APLMS would bring an ACO-backed sportscar series to Asia and the Pacific. This could be seen as a resurrection of the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship (JSPC) which had ended in 1992. The ACO had previous backed a single Japanese event, the 1999 Le Mans Fuji 1000km which combined Le Mans cars with JGTC machines for automatic entries to the 2000 24 Hours of Le Mans. This idea was followed by the American Le Mans Series with the 2000 Race of a Thousand Years race at the Adelaide Street Circuit in Australia. These two events served as a precursor to the planned APLMS series, and at the time of the creation of ELMS, Don Panoz announced his intention to hold an exhibition APLMS race at Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia in late 2001.
As the ELMS season went on, it became apparent that there was a lack of interest in the series, and Don Panoz decided that the APLMS would likely have even less interest. Thus the APLMS exhibition race and all plans for a series were scrapped.

Archibald Thomas Pechey

Archibald Thomas Pechey (26 September 1876 in West Ham, Essex – 29 November 1961 in Wells, Somerset, England) often credited as Valentine, was an English lyricist and novelist. The pen name Valentine was derived from his mother's family the Vallentins, who were London distillers. Pechey's maternal grandfather Sir James Vallentin (1814–1870) was Knight Sheriff of London, and Master of the Worshipful Company of Distillers. By the 1880s Pechey's uncle Grimble Vallentine was running the business in Lambeth. His cousin John Franks Vallentin (1882–1914) was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1914.
Pechey as "Valentine" often wrote lyrics in conjunction with composer James W. Tate, including for "The Beauty Spot". Songs written by Tate and Valentine (with F. Clifford Harris) include "A Bachelor Gay" and "A Paradise for Two" (both 1917, from "The Maid of the Mountains"). As a playwright his biggest success was "Tons of Money", a farce co-written with Will Evans, which ran in the West End from April 1922 for 737 performances.
Pechey wrote stories, such as "The Adjusters" (1922) and "An Exploit of The Adjusters: The Man Who Scared The Bank" (1929), under the name Valentine. "The Adjusters" and its sequels are about a group of amateur crime fighters with complementary talents, who "adjust" the results of the law, often tricking criminals into trapping themselves using a logical analysis of the crime, so that the guilty are punished and the good are protected, released or compensated. The Adjusters characters are Daphne Wrayne, a sporting society girl; Sir Hugh Williamson, a noted African explorer; James Treviller, a handsome young nobleman; Martin Everest, a handsome lawyer; and Alan Sylvester, an actor.
Pechey married Bijou Sortain Hancock, and was the father of well known television cook Fanny Cradock. His wife’s extravagance and his own susceptibility to gambling left him with sizeable debts. He seems to have tried to avoid the debts by moving around the country. He left Herne Bay in Kent and moved to Swanage in Dorset, then to Bournemouth in Hampshire, where his brother Richard Francis Pechey (1872–1963) had become the Vicar of Holy Trinity Church in 1919. He finally moved to Wroxham in Norfolk, c1927, where his debtors caught up with him and by 1930 he was appearing in Norfolk's bankruptcy court faced with debts of £3,500.
Once out of debt, Pechey moved to Somerset, switched his pseudonym to Mark Cross and wrote over 45 crime novels under that name between 1934 and 1961, many of them about the Adjusters. The novels include the thrillers "The Shadow of the Four" and "Who Killed Henry Wickenstrom". Pechey also drew the cover art for some stories.

Kalverstraat

The Kalverstraat (, ) is a busy shopping street of Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands. The street runs roughly North-South for about 750 meters, from Dam Square to Muntplein square. 
The Kalverstraat is the most expensive shopping street in the Netherlands, with rents of up to 3000 euros per square meter (2016). In 2009 it was the 17th most expensive street in the world measured by rent prices. The Kalverstraat is also the most expensive street in the Dutch version of Monopoly.
The Amsterdam Museum is located in a former orphanage between Kalverstraat and Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal.
History.
After the construction of the medieval city walls, the street between Munttoren (originally a gate in the city walls) and Spui square came to be known as "Byndewyck". The street later became known as Kalverstraat ("calf street"), after the cattle market that was held here from 1486 until 1629. 
In 1345 a eucharistic miracle was said to have taken place in a home between the Kalverstraat in the Rokin. The event is commemorated by the annual Stille Omgang procession. A chapel, the Heilige Stede, was built on the spot where the miracle was said to have occurred. The Heiligeweg connected the Kalverstraat with this pilgrim chapel, and with Leidsestraat.
Painter Piet Mondrian lived at Kalverstraat 154 from 1892 to 1895. The first HEMA department store opened on the Kalverstraat in 1926. On May 7, 1945, drunk German soldiers shooting from the windows of a building at the corner of Kalverstraat and Dam square killed 19 civilians celebrating their liberation from the Nazis and the end of World War II. A fire in the Kalverstraat on May 9, 1977, claimed 33 lives.

José Mota (baseball)

José Manuel Mota Matos (born March 16, 1965) is a Dominican baseball broadcaster. He currently covers the Los Angeles Dodgers on Spectrum SportsNet LA. He formerly covered the Los Angeles Angels with Bally Sports West from 2002 until his departure in 2022. He began on the Angels Spanish broadcast in 2002 and took on various roles on the English television broadcast starting in 2007. He worked alongside Amaury Pi-Gonzalez in the broadcast booth in Spanish and alongside Mark Gubicza in English. Fully bilingual, he conducts postgame interviews and often doubles as the translator for Spanish-speaking players. He served as a pre-and-postgame analyst on "Angels Live" and occasionally filled in as a backup play-by-play announcer for English broadcasts. He is the son of former baseball player and long-time Dodgers coach Manny Mota.
Playing career.
Mota attended Cal State Fullerton in Orange County on a baseball scholarship. He was drafted in the second round of the 1985 amateur draft by the Chicago White Sox. He spent time in the Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Dodgers organizations before being drafted by the Oakland Athletics in with the rule 5 draft. He was then sent to the San Diego Padres in in a three-team trade and made his major league debut in with the Padres. He later signed with the Kansas City Royals as a free agent, but only appeared in two games in .
In 19 games, Mota had 8 hits in 38 at-bats, resulting in a .211 batting average. He scored four runs and drove in two more.
Broadcasting career.
Following his playing career, Mota sought to work in baseball broadcasting. He was mentored by Stu Nahan, Jim Hill, and Fred Roggin, among others. Mota's first major broadcast job was a brief fill-in stint for Jaime Jarrín on the Los Angeles Dodgers Spanish broadcast.
Los Angeles Angels.
Mota worked on the Angels' Spanish-language radio broadcasts beginning in 2002. With the team adding 50 games to their English-language television package in 2007, Mota added those games to his workload.
Mota has previous television experience as a sideline reporter, and he also filled in for Rex Hudler during his suspension in 2003. He also was a third announcer in the team's over-the-air television booth in 2004 and 2005.
Soon after the conclusion of the 2007 season, the Angels announced that Mota would no longer work as the play-by-play announcer for television games broadcast in English as he had done during that season. His place was taken by Rory Markas, who doubled as the radio play-by-play announcer for the Angels until Markas's death on January 4, 2010. Victor Rojas would take Markas's spot. Along with partner Mark Gubicza, he would cover roughly 75 games for the Angels.
During the first half of the 2021 season, Mota occasionally filled in as the English play-by-play announcer when the primary commentators, Matt Vasgersian and Daron Sutton, were unavailable due to other broadcast obligations. After Sutton was replaced mid-season by Rich Waltz, Patrick O'Neal took over Mota's de facto "third-string" play-by-play broadcasting role, filling in when Vasgersian was broadcasting with ESPN or MLB Network and when Waltz was broadcasting with CBS Sports. Mota returned to his more typical roles of "Angels Live" analysis and field-level reporting in the second half of the 2021 season.
On February 3, 2022, Mota announced on Instagram that he decided to depart Bally Sports West. He expressed his gratitude for the Angels organization and said he felt it was time for a "new chapter" but did not immediately announce his future plans.
"Major League Baseball on FOX".
Mota worked for FOX on their coverage of the 2006 Major League Baseball postseason after Steve Lyons was removed from the broadcast for perceived racially insensitive remarks.
Los Angeles Dodgers.
In March 2022, it was announced that Mota would join the Spectrum SportsNet LA broadcast team to cover the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was among a group of newcomers to the network that included Jessica Mendoza, Adrián González, Eric Karros, and Dontrelle Willis.
Other ventures.
Mota has also handled several Spanish language assignments in both baseball and football for Fox Sports. Mota also did English language coverage of the 2009 Caribbean Series with Florida Marlins broadcaster Cookie Rojas, the father of eventual Angels broadcaster Victor Rojas, on MLB Network.
Mota made one film appearance, in the 1999 Kevin Costner film "For Love of the Game" as a Dominican shortstop.
Personal life.
Mota's father, Manny, was an MLB player who also spent over three decades with the Dodgers as a coach. Because of his father's involvement with the Dodgers, Mota grew up around the team's clubhouse and served as a batboy. His brother, Andy, played for the Houston Astros and now works as a player agent. His cousin, José Báez, played for the Seattle Mariners.

List of diplomatic missions of South Korea

The following is a list of diplomatic missions of South Korea. Diplomatic missions of the South Korea shall be established in foreign countries under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Foreign Affairs to take partial charge of diplomatic or consular affairs under the control of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Diplomatic missions of South Korea shall be classified into Embassy (), Representative Office () and Consulate-General (). According to the Act on the Establishment of Diplomatic missions abroad of South Korea, Consulate () and Consular Office () may be established in the missions, as prescribed by Presidential Decree, if necessary to assign the said offices with affairs under the jurisdiction of the missions.
History.
In the 1980s the Roh Tae-woo administration gradually initiated diplomatic links with Warsaw Pact countries, in a policy known as "Nordpolitik". This led to the opening of representative offices and later embassies in socialist regimes in Europe and Asia. The Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s and an export-orientated trade policy led to South Korea to rationalize its diplomatic network. However, after bouncing back from the crisis, South Korea continues to open and re-open diplomatic missions in many countries. With neither North Korea or South Korea recognizing the sovereignty of the other state, nor the legitimacy of each other's governments, there are no South Korean diplomatic missions in North Korea.

Operational history.
Royal Netherlands Navy.
"K IX" was based in the Netherlands East Indies from 13 May 1924. By the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, "K IX" was out of commission but was returned to active service in March 1942. Following the fall of the Netherlands East Indies "K IX" escaped to Fremantle, Western Australia, arriving on 13 March 1942.
Transfer to Australia.
In May 1942 the Dutch government offered "K IX" to the Royal Australian Navy for use in anti-submarine warfare training. This offer was accepted and "K IX" arrived in Sydney for repairs on 12 May. On 1 June "K IX" was damaged by a torpedo explosion during the attack on Sydney Harbour. "K IX" was decommissioned from the Royal Netherlands Navy on 25 July 1942 and following extensive repairs was commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy as HMAS "K9" on 22 June 1943.
Due to the boat's poor mechanical condition HMAS "K9" saw little service with the RAN and spent most of her time in commission under repair. "K9" was badly damaged by a battery explosion on 22 January 1944. Due to a lack of spare parts the submarine was decommissioned on 31 March 1944, having spent only 31 days at sea. Following her decommissioning "K9" re-entered Dutch service as an oil lighter. "K9" was washed ashore near Seal Rocks, New South Wales on 8 June 1945 while under tow to Merauke in Dutch New Guinea and subsequently stripped for scrap.
The remnants of K9 were located on 20 July 1999 by the New South Wales Government's Heritage Office. The beach on which it grounded and its remnants remain is known as Submarine Beach.

Indigenous Australian self-determination

Indigenous Australian self-determination, also known as Aboriginal Australian self-determination, is the power relating to self-governance by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia. It is the right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to determine their own political status and pursue their own economic, social and cultural interests. Self-determination asserts that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should direct and implement Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy formulation and provision of services. Self-determination encompasses both Aboriginal land rights and self-governance, and may also be supported by a treaty between a government and an Indigenous group in Australia.
From the 1970s to 1990s, the Australian government supported Aboriginal groups moving from large settlements in remote areas back to outstation communities in formerly traditional lands. Also from the early 1970s, Aboriginal communities began running their own health services, legal services, and housing cooperatives.
1960s-70s.
During this period, the Whitlam government changed Australian Indigenous policy significantly by moving away from cultural assimilation and towards self-determination.
Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.
The Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders was founded in 1957 as a non-governmental organization to advance Aboriginal rights, composed of various member organisations.
Department of Aboriginal Affairs.
The Department of Aboriginal Affairs was founded by the Whitlam government to replace the government agencies responsible for Indigenous affairs, the Council for Aboriginal Affairs, and the Office of Aboriginal Affairs, while also providing a route for self-determination by employing Indigenous Australians.
National Aboriginal Consultative Committee.
The National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (NACC) was the first elected body representing Indigenous Australians on the national level, having been established by the Whitlam government in 1972. It was composed of 36 representatives elected by Aboriginal people in 36 regions of Australia. In 1983, the elections reached a turnout of approximately 78%. However, the organisation was marred by friction with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, while internally lacking coherence.
National Aboriginal Conference.
Following a review in 1976, the NACC was abolished by the new Fraser government in 1977. To replace it, the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC) was founded.
1980s-90s.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC).
Following the election of the Hawke government in 1983, two reports were commissioned into a replacement of the NAC. The O'Donoghue report argued that the NAC did not effectively represent its constituents or advocate specific policies. The Coombs report made the case for an organisation with representation of regions and existing indigenous organisations.
To respond to these recommendations, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission was founded in 1989.
Following allegations of corruption, it was abolished by the Howard government in 2004.
Aboriginal Provisional Government.
The Aboriginal Provisional Government has campaigned for Aboriginal sovereignty in Australia, and is headed by an Elders Council. It also issues Aboriginal passports.
2000 – current.
The dissolution of ATSIC in 2004 was seen by some as an end to self-determination as a policy. Nevertheless, calls for it have continued among Indigenous Australians.
Uluru Statement.
The "Uluru Statement from the Heart" was a call for a "First Nations Voice" and a "Makarrata Commission" to drive "agreement-making" and "truth-telling", made by a First Nations National Constitutional Convention in 2017. This suggestion was refused by the Turnbull government.
Victorian First Peoples' Assembly.
In 2018 the state of Victoria passed legislation which established the legal framework for an Aboriginal representative body with which the state could negotiate a treaty. This resulted in the 2019 Victorian First Peoples' Assembly election, to elect the 21 members of the First Peoples' Assembly.
Indigenous voice to government.
On 30 October 2019, Wyatt announced the commencement of a "co-design process" aimed at providing an "Indigenous voice to government". The Senior Advisory Group is co-chaired by Professor Tom Calma , Chancellor of the University of Canberra, and Professor Dr Marcia Langton, Associate Provost at the University of Melbourne, and comprises a total of 20 leaders and experts from across the country. The models for the Voice are being developed in two stages:
The first meeting of the group was held in Canberra on 13 November 2019.

André Cazeneuve

André Cazeneuve (10 December 1817 - 20 August 1874) was a French soldier, a horse trainer in the Guard of Emperor Napoleon III with the rank of corporal. He was a member of the first French military mission to Japan in 1867. He served as a cavalry instructor for the army of the "shōgun", and introduced Arabian horses in Japan.
In 1868 the Boshin War broke out between the Shōgun and the forces supporting the restoration of the Mikado's authority. The foreign powers in Japan, including France, declared neutrality in the conflict. Cazeneuve therefore resigned from the French army and entered the service of the "shōgun", along with Jules Brunet. He was commissioned as a captain.
Cazeneuve fought in the Battle of Hakodate, in command of one of the four Shogunate regiments. He was severely wounded in the battle, but was brought back to Yokohama at the end of the conflict and transported to France.
He returned to Japan in 1871, where the new Meiji government employed him to supervise their military horse usage. He died in 1874 in Japan.

Menıñ Qazaqstanym

"Menıñ Qazaqstanym" ('My Kazakhstan') is the national anthem of Kazakhstan since 7 January 2006, replacing the previous anthem first used upon independence in 1991.
It is based on a homonymous patriotic song created by Kazakh composer Shamshi Kaldayakov and poet Jumeken Najimedenov in 1956. The original lyrics were modified in 2005 by the first president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, before the decree was issued.
History.
In 1943, when Kazakhstan was then a part of the Soviet Union, a competition was announced to create a national anthem for the Kazakh nation. The then-27-year-old poet Qaiym Muhamedhanov, in collaboration with Äbdilda Täjibaev and Ğabıt Müsirepov, wrote the lyrics to the anthem, which were set to the music composed by Mukan Tölebaev, Eugene Brusilovsky and Latıf Hamıdı. Their work was then chosen by Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic to be used as the Republic's official regional anthem. 
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, new lyrics were used for the succeeding anthem; however, the Soviet-era melody was retained.
On 9 May 2000, a ceremony was held, and then-President Nursultan Nazarbayev publicly stated that there should be a new anthem. A few weeks later, the Mäjilis took into consideration a replacement. A few candidates had been selected, but the process had later been abandoned. 
In 2005, a popular patriotic song written in 1956, titled "Menıñ Qazaqstanym", was chosen to be the new national anthem of Kazakhstan. The song originally had three verses of eight lines each, along with the chorus. Nazarbayev modified the lyrics and reduced the text to two verses followed by the chorus. The first verse and the chorus of the original text were changed slightly, the second verse was omitted completely, and the third verse (now serving as the second verse in the current official edition) had five of the eight lines changed. On 7 January 2006, the new text was later amended to comply with the status of the national anthem.
The law for listening to the national anthem was also changed. When the national anthem is performed at official ceremonies, citizens of Kazakhstan must stand up and place the palm of their right hand on the left side of their chest.
Lyrics.
Original song.
This song is based on a 1956 patriotic song titled "Menıñ Qazaqstanym" created in response to the Soviet Virgin Lands Campaign program. There is debate over whether it was to celebrate the program or to insist Soviet authorities should not turn Kazakhstan into Russia's corn belt.
Protocol.
"Menıñ Qazaqstanym" is played during official state ceremonies and social functions, such as sporting events involving national sports teams of Kazakhstan. All radio stations and television networks across the country play the national anthem twice, once during sign-on and sign-off every day, the performance of the anthem is not regulated by any government law; however, there is traditional protocol that is employed during a performance of the song. Most citizens put their hands over their heart while singing the anthem following United States practice. Traditionally universal etiquette is to stand during the performance. Officers and personnel of the Kazakh Armed Forces offer a Russian-style military salute when in uniform during the performance of the anthem when not in formation.
Criticism.
Nazarbayev's co-authorship was perceived in a negative light by some writers of Kazakhstan. In 2009, Kazakh poet Erlan Jünıs criticized the then-President of Kazakhstan, saying:
2012 sporting event incidents.
In March 2012, a parody national anthem, titled "O Kazakhstan", featured in the soundtrack of the movie "Borat", was mistakenly played at the International Shooting Grand Prix in Kuwait. The Gold-winning medalist, Mariya Dmitriyenko, stood on the dais while the entire parody was played. The team complained, and the award ceremony was re-staged. The incident apparently resulted from the wrong song being downloaded from YouTube at the last minute. Senior officials in Kazakhstan were furious with the error and vowed to make a complaint to their Kuwaiti counterparts.
A similar incident had taken place earlier that month at the opening ceremony of a skiing festival in Qostanai, in which the first bar of Ricky Martin's single "Livin' La Vida Loca" was played instead of "Menıñ Qazaqstanym". However, "Menıñ Qazaqstanym" was played properly following the mistake.

Binas (book)

The Binas (Often written as BiNaS or BINAS) is a Dutch science reference work (a "handbook") for the higher levels of secondary school, consisting largely of tables and formulas. The name stands for biologie, natuurkunde, scheikunde (biology, physics, chemistry). It is compiled by NVON (Dutch Association for Education in the Natural Sciences) and has been published by Noordhoff Uitgevers since it became the standard reference work allowed at the central examinations in 1975. An English version of the Binas is also available.
Contents.
The Binas is divided into five chapters: general, physics, mathematics, chemistry, and biology. Each chapter consists of multiple tables, each with specific information. These tables can be short or can span up to a few pages. To find information, students can use the alphabetical register in the back. The Binas does not make use of page numbers, but instead the register refers you to a table number.

Anna Wheeler (author)

Anna Wheeler (c. 1780 – 1848), also known by her maiden name of Anna Doyle, was an Irish-born British writer and advocate of political rights for women and the benefits of contraception. She married Francis Massey Wheeler when she was "about 16" and he was "about 19", although the year is not known. They separated twelve years later. After his death she supplemented her income by translating the works of French philosophers.
She was an acquaintance of Robert Owen, Jeremy Bentham, and Frances Wright. The philosopher William Thompson described his book "Appeal of One Half of the Human Race, Women, Against the Pretensions of the Other Half, Men, to Retain them in Political, and Hence in Civil and Domestic, Slavery" as the "joint property" of himself and her.
A staunch advocate of political rights for women and equal opportunities in education, she was friendly with French feminists and socialists.
Early life.
Anna Doyle was the daughter of the Rev. Nicholas Milley Doyle, a Church of Ireland clergyman, Rector of Newcastle, County Tipperary. She had no formal education, but learned French, geography, reading and writing at home. In 1795, at about the age of fifteen, she married Francis Massey Wheeler, of Lizard Connell, heir to an estate at Ballywire, who proposed to her at a ball. Born in 1776, and a grandson of Hugh Massy, 1st Baron Massy (1700–1788) he was himself only nineteen, and they set up home in County Limerick. According to the autobiography of her daughter Rosina, Wheeler had five daughters, although a more general source says two. Her daughter Rosina Doyle Wheeler, who later wrote that she had been born in 1802, became the novelist Rosina Bulwer Lytton.
Wheeler read widely, taking in both the French Age of Enlightenment thinkers and Mary Wollstonecraft. Her husband was an abusive alcoholic, so she separated from him after twelve years by moving to Guernsey to live with her uncle, General Sir John Doyle then in post as Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey. In 1815 she moved to London, to benefit the education of her daughters. By 1816 she had started journeying through France.
One of her brothers, Sir John Milley Doyle (1781–1856) was a commander of British and Portuguese forces in the Peninsular War and the War of the Two Brothers.
Later life.
Wheeler's husband died in 1820 and left her penniless, so she supplemented her income by translating into English the works of Charles Fourier and other French Owenite philosophers. She managed to spend her life travelling, staying with friends and promoting the news and ideas of the feminist movement. She lived principally in London, Dublin, Caen, and Paris.
In London, she met Robert Owen, Jeremy Bentham and Frances Wright, and became close friends with William Thompson. In 1825, provoked by James Mill's dismissal of political representation for women, Thompson wrote "Appeal of One Half of the Human Race, Women, Against the Pretensions of the Other Half, Men, to Retain them in Political, and Hence in Civil and Domestic, Slavery". Thompson described the book as the "joint property" of himself and Anna Wheeler. They were both advocates of the benefits of contraception.
Wheeler was one of the first women to campaign for women's rights at public meetings in England. She sometimes spoke at the South Place Chapel, "a radical gathering-place" then under the leadership of the Reverend William Johnson Fox and now better known as Conway Hall. Unitarians, like Quakers, supported female equality, and this chapel, situated on Finsbury Square in central London, gave her the pulpit to speak on "The Rights of Women". In this address of 1829, Wheeler forensically refuted arguments for male superiority and encouraged women to work together to create an organisation "to obtain... the removal of the disabilities of women and the introduction of a national system of equal education for the Infants of both sexes."
A staunch advocate of political rights for women and of equal opportunities in education, Wheeler was a friend of the French feminists and socialists Flora Tristan and Desirée Veret. In the early 1830s. she helped to establish the journal "". Her other friends and associates included Henri Saint-Simon and Charles Fourier, Suzanne Voilquin (editor of "Tribune des femmes"), Marie-Reine Guindorf, and Jeanne Deroin.
In 1833 William Thompson died, leaving Wheeler an annuity of £100, which was then enough to maintain a modest household.
Death and descendants.
Wheeler was forced to withdraw from public life in the 1840s due to ill health, and she died on 7 May 1848 in Camden, London, having refused invitations to take part in the revolution in France of that year.
Wheeler's daughter Rosina Bulwer Lytton was a novelist and outspoken public speaker. Her grandson Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton, served as Viceroy of India from 1876 to 1880, and two of her great grandsons became the second and third Earls of Lytton.
One of Wheeler's great-granddaughters was the sister-in-law of the Prime Minister Gerald Balfour, while another, Lady Constance Lytton, followed Anna's role model and became a leading suffragette protester, hunger striker and writer, and a third, Lady Emily Bulwer-Lytton, dismayed her parents by successfully proposing to the architect Edwin Landseer Lutyens and later became a Theosophist. The biographers Mary Lutyens and Jane Ridley (born 1953) are descendants of that marriage.

Arthur &quot;Slim&quot; Evans

Arthur Herbert "Slim" Evans (April 24, 1890 – February 13, 1944) led the industrial labour union movement in Canada and the United States. He is most known for leading the On To Ottawa Trek. Evans was involved in the Industrial Workers of the World, the One Big Union, and the Workers' Unity League. He was a member of the Communist Party of Canada.
Personal life.
Evans was born in Toronto in 1890. At age 13, he left school to support his family. He worked numerous jobs, including horse driver and carpenter. Evans travelled west in 1911 and worked in various places, first as a farmer, then as a carpenter in Winnipeg, Minneapolis and Kansas City.
On August 4, 1920, Arthur "Slim" Evans married Ethel Hawkins, whom he met while organizing miners in Drumheller, Alberta. On April 13, 1922, the couple had their first child, a son named Stewart. Stewart Evans died in 1925 during the diphtheria epidemic in Vancouver. They had a second child, Jean Stewart Evans, on February 12, 1927. Jean would go on to write "Work and Wages!", a biography of her father.
Wobblies.
In Minneapolis, he became involved with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or "Wobblies"). He led an IWW free speech rally in Minneapolis, where he was arrested for participating and sentenced to three years in jail. Evans later recalled: "All I did was read it. I was too shy and nervous then to make up any speech of my own." In 1912, he led a strike of political prisoners, resulting in his release.
He was present at the 1913 miners' strike in Ludlow, Colorado. He met IWW leaders "Big" Bill Haywood, Frank Little, and the legendary Joe Hill there. Two days after Evans arrived, strikebreakers hired by John D. Rockefeller, owner of the coal mines, attacked the strikers' camp, killing 20 people, including 12 children, in the Ludlow Massacre. Evans was shot in the leg with a machine gun. He walked with a limp for the rest of his life as a result.
Evans returned to Canada and continued his union activism. He led the One Big Union local of coal miners in Drumheller, Alberta. He led a strike of 6,300 One Big Union miners during the Canadian Labour Revolt in 1919. It was there he met his future wife Ethel, daughter of a Drumheller miner who had been involved in organizing the union. The strike was suppressed by anti-union mercenaries hired by the mining company. Because the One Big Union was not recognized, and workers were officially organized within the United Mine Workers, Evans had technically organized a 'wild cat' strike without permission. Evans used UMWA funds for the strike, he was accused of embezzlement and sentenced to a three-year prison term. Evan was released upon a petition from the workers he supposedly embezzled from.
Evans, and other former wobblies became a member of the Communist Party of Canada after it formed in 1921. Evans officially became a party member in 1926.
Worker's Unity League.
The Worker's Unity League was the official trade union centre of the Communist Party of Canada. Like the IWW and OBU, which Evans had previously organized, the Workers' Unity League was an industrial union. Evans was a major organizer within the union.
Princeton coal miner's strike.
In 1932, coal miners saw their wages cut by 10% in Princeton, British Columbia. The miners contacted the Workers' Unity League, which sent Evans to organize a union in September 1932. The company refused to negotiate with the union, so the workers voted to strike. Evans advised the workers to wait until December to strike, because the demand for coal would be much higher. The strike began on December 22. British Columbia's attorney general dispatched crops of 40 RCMP officers to monitor Evans and suppress the strike. Officers assaulted the striking miners with batons, along with their families, while they were picketing. The Ku Klux Klan burned crosses, beat strikers, and sent threatening letters in the name of anti-communism.
Evans was arrested under Section 98, which allows arbitrary detention of suspected communists. He was imprisoned in far off Oakella Prison, where he did hard-labour before being released on bail. During his imprisonment, his wife and daughter were evicted from the home Evan had built for them. Following his release, Evans was kidnapped by off duty police constables and klansmen. A convoy of armed cars took him to Vancouver. The kidnappers threatened: "Take warning and move on or suffer the consequences". Evans immediately booked a train back to Princeton, where he led the strike to success, winning workers higher pay and improved workplace safety. Evans was again arrested under Section 98 and sentenced to one year in prison without bail. He rejected the legitimacy of the trial, and instead of defending himself, he sang The Internationale.
On-to-Ottawa trek.
In 1935, Evans led the On-to-Ottawa Trek. Communist activists, including Evans, had organized workers in the government relief camps into the Relief Camp Workers' Union three years previously, in 1932. Relief camp workers struck on April 4, 1935, when they went to Vancouver, where they stayed and pressed their demands until the Trek began on June 3. The first batch of strikers left Vancouver, riding on boxcars, and were joined by many others in Kamloops, Field, Golden, Calgary and Moose Jaw. By the time they reached Regina, Saskatchewan, their numbers had climbed to over 2,000. Evans led a delegation to go ahead of the strikers and meet with the prime minister, R. B. "Iron Heel" Bennett. The two leaders engaged in a heated exchange when Bennett accused Evans of being an embezzler. Evans' response received much publicity:
The meeting accomplished little more than to illustrate the government's intransigence and the strikers' determination, and the delegation left Ottawa to rejoin the strikers in Regina.
Evans and other Trek leaders were arrested at a large demonstration of strikers and supporters on July 1, 1935 (now called Dominion Day, or Canada Day), precipitating the Regina Riot. The federal government had decided that the Trek would be forcibly stopped in Regina because of fears that it would gain momentum if allowed to reach Winnipeg, that could turn it from a protest into a revolutionary movement.
Evans was charged under Section 98, a section of the Criminal Code added in the aftermath of the Winnipeg General Strike, outlawing membership in revolutionary organizations. An exhaustive government inquiry was held into the causes of the riot, and its conclusions paved the way for reforming the relief camp system. This outcome and the overwhelming defeat of R. B. Bennett are two indicators that the strike was a success, even though the Trek was crushed.
Later organizing.
Evans continued his union activism, organizing the miners and smelter workers in Trail, British Columbia, into the CIO union, Mine, Mill, and Smelters Union. While organizing the smelters, his car was torched by the mine owners. He also led fundraising drives for the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, the volunteer contingent from Canada that fought the fascists during the Spanish Civil War. His last union position was as the shop steward at the Vancouver Shipyards.
Death.
He died in Vancouver on February 13, 1944, aged 53. After leaving a streetcar, he was struck by a motorist crossing between the streets of Kingsway and Joyce.

Michael Fennelly (hurler)

Michael Fennelly (born 28 February 1985) is an Irish hurling manager and former player. His league and championship career at senior level with the Kilkenny county team lasted twelve seasons from 2006 until 2017. He managed the Offaly senior hurling team between 2019 and 2022.
Born in Ballyhale, County Kilkenny, Fennelly was brought up in a family that had a strong association with hurling. His grandfather, Kevin Fennelly Snr, played with Kilkenny in the 1940s, while his uncles - Brendan, Ger, Kevin, Jnr, Liam and Seán - all played for Kilkenny from the 1970s until the 1990s
Fennelly first played competitive hurling at juvenile and underage levels with the Ballyhale Shamrocks club. After much success in these grades he later won three All-Ireland medals with the club's senior team. He has also won four Leinster medals and six county senior championship medals.
Fennelly made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of eighteen when he was selected for the Kilkenny minor team. He enjoyed one championship season with the minor team, culminating with an All-Ireland medal. Fennelly subsequently joined the Kilkenny under-21 team, winning All-Ireland medals in 2004 and 2006. By this stage he had also joined the Kilkenny senior team, making his debut during the 2006 league. Over the course of the next twelve seasons, Fennelly won eight All-Ireland medals, including a record-equalling four championships in-a-row from 2006 to 2009, followed by back-to-back triumphs in 2011 and 2012 and a final two championships in 2014 and 2015. The All-Ireland-winning captain of 2009, he was denied a ninth All-Ireland medal in September 2016. Fennelly also won nine Leinster medals, five National Hurling League medals and was named All-Star and Texaco Hurler of the Year in 2011. He was later joined on the Kilkenny team by his brother Colin. Fennelly announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 29 December 2017 and from club hurling on 28 May 2020.
Playing career.
Club.
After much success at underage levels, including four successive under-21 championships, Fennelly quickly joined the Ballyhale Shamrocks senior team. Two years later he was deployed further out the field as Ballyhale faced O'Loughlin Gaels in the senior decider. An impressive 1–22 to 2–11 victory gave Fennelly his first championship medal. He later added a Leinster medal to his collection when Ballyhale secured a comprehensive 1–20 to 1–8 defeat of Birr to take the provincial title for the first time in seventeen years. On 17 March 2007 Ballyhale Shamrocks faced Loughrea in the All-Ireland decider. On a day when Henry Shefflin and James "Cha" Fitzpatrick were held scoreless, the three Reid brothers contributed 3–7 from play. A 3–12 to 2–8 victory gave Fennelly an All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship medal.
Fennelly added a second championship medal to his collection in 2007 following a 1–20 to 1–10 drubbing of St. Martin's.
Ballyhale Shamrocks made it three-in-a-row in 2008. A 2–11 to 0–12 defeat of James Stephens gave Fennelly a third successive championship medal. He later won a second Leinster medal as the Shamrocks defeated reigning champions Birr by 2–13 to 1–11.
Fennelly won a fourth successive championship medal in 2009, as Ballyhale claimed a record-equaling four-in-a-row following a 1–14 to 1–11 defeat of James Stephens once again. The subsequent provincial decider saw Ballyhale hit fifteen wides, however, Fennelly still collected a third Leinster medal following a 1–16 to 1–8 defeat of Tullamore. On 17 March 2010 Ballyhale faced three-in-a-row Portumna in a "dream" All-Ireland decider. The game failed to live up to the billing, however, 1–19 to 0–17 victory gave Fennelly a second All-Ireland medal.
Five-in-a-row proved beyond Ballyhale Shamrocks, however, the team bounced back in 2012 having lost the championship decider the previous year. A far from vintage 0–16 to 0–12 defeat of Dicksboro gave Fennelly a fifth championship medal.
Fennelly won a sixth championship medal in 2014 as the Shamrocks claimed a 1–20 to 1–13 defeat of reigning champions Clara. Fennelly later collected a fourth Leinster medal as veteran Henry Shefflin proved the difference in a 0–21 to 1–14 defeat of Kilcormacv/Killoughey. On 17 March 2015 Ballyhale faced Kilmallock in the All-Ireland decider. A complete mismatch saw Shamrocks win the game by 1–18 to 1–6, with Fennelly collecting a third All-Ireland medal.
Minor and under-21.
Fennelly first played for Kilkenny as a member of the minor team during the 2003 Leinster Championship. He made his first appearance for the team on 25 June 2003 when he lined out at midfield in a 4-12 to 0-11 defeat of Dublin. Fennelly was retained at midfield when Kilkenny qualified to play Offaly in the Leinster final on 6 July 2003. He was held scoreless throughout the game but ended with a winners' medal after an 0-18 to 0-13 victory. On 14 September 2003, Fennelly was again selected at midfield when Kilkenny faced Galway in the All-Ireland final. He was once again held scoreless but claimed an All-Ireland medal following the 2-16 to 2-15 victory.
Fennelly was just out of the minor grade when he was drafted onto the Kilkenny under-21 team before the 2004 Leinster Championship. He made his first appearance in the grade on 2 June 2004 in a 0-20 to 2-10 defeat of Laois. On 14 July 2004, Fennelly won a Leinster Championship medal after lining out at left corner-back in a 1-16 to 2-03 defeat of Wexford in the final. He retained his position at left corner-back when Kilkenny qualified for the All-Ireland final against Tipperary. Fennelly ended the game with a winners' medal following a 3-21 to 1-06 victory. It was Fennelly's first All-Ireland medal.
On 20 July 2005, Fennelly missed Kilkenny's 0-17 to 1-10 defeat of Dublin in the Leinster final due to a hand injury. He was back on the starting fifteen for the All-Ireland final against Galway on 18 September 2005, however, Fennelly ended the game on the losing side after a 1-15 to 1-14 defeat.
On 27 July 2006, Fennelly won a third successive Leinster Championship medal - his second on the field of play - after lining out at midfield in the 2-18 to 2-10 defeat of Dublin in the final. On 10 September 2006, he was again selected at midfield when Kilkenny drew 2-14 apiece with Tipperary in the All-Ireland final. Fennelly retained the midfield berth for the replay on 16 September 2006 and collected a second winners' medal after the 1-11 to 0-11 victory.
Senior.
Beginnings.
While still a member of the under-21 team, Fennelly was added to the Kilkenny senior panel in 2006. He made his debut during the National Hurling League, and subsequently collected his first winners' medal following a 3–11 to 0–14 victory over Limerick. On 2 July 2006 he made his senior championship debut in a facile 1–23 to 2–12 provincial final defeat of Wexford. It was his first Leinster medal. Fennelly later shared in Kilkenny's All-Ireland defeat of Cork as a non-playing substitute.
Fennelly collected a second Leinster medal in 2007, as Kilkenny asserted their provincial dominance and defeated Wexford by 2–24 to 1–12. On 2 September 2007 Kilkenny faced defeated Munster finalists and surprise All-Ireland semi-final winners Limerick in the championship decider. Kilkenny got off to a flying start with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin scoring two goals within the first ten minutes to set the tone. Limerick launched a second-half comeback, however, "the Cats" were too powerful and cruised to a 2–19 to 1–15 victory. Fennelly, who started the game on the bench, came on to collect his first All-Ireland medal on the field of play.
On and off the team.
In 2008 Fennelly broke his wrist in a club game which ruled him out of the latter stages of the provincial championship. He was back as an unused substitute as Kilkenny later claimed a third successive All-Ireland title following a 3–30 to 1–13 defeat of Waterford.
Fennelly was appointed captain of the team in 2009, however, he found it difficult to claim a place on the starting fifteen. On 6 September Kilkenny were poised to become the second team ever in the history of hurling to win four successive All-Ireland championships when they faced Tipperary in the decider. Fennelly, in spite of being captain, started the game on the bench before being introduced as a late substitute. For long periods Tipp looked the likely winners, however, late goals from Henry Shefflin and substitute Martin Comerford finally killed off their efforts to secure a 2–22 to 0–23 victory. Fennelly had collected his second All-Ireland medal on the field of play, while he also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup.
In 2010 Kilkenny defeated Galway in an eagerly-anticipated but ultimately disappointing provincial decider. A 1–19 to 1–12 victory gave Fennelly a third Leinster medal. The drive for a fifth successive All-Ireland crown reached a head on 5 September 2010, when Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. "The Cats" lost talisman Henry Shefflin due to injury, while Tipperary's Lar Corbett ran riot and scored a hat-trick of goals as Fennelly's side fell to a 4–17 to 1–18 defeat. In spite of this defeat, Fennelly later won his first All-Star award.
Continued dominance.
Kilkenny's stranglehold in Leinster continued in 2011. A 4–17 to 1–15 defeat of Dublin gave "the Cats" a record-equalling seventh successive championship. It was Fennelly's fourth winners' medal overall. Kilkenny subsequently faced Tipperary in a record-breaking sixth successive All-Ireland decider on 4 September 2011. Goals by Fennelly and Richie Hogan in either half gave Kilkenny, who many viewed as the underdogs going into the game, a 2–17 to 1–16 victory. It was Fennelly's third All-Ireland medal, while he later collected a second consecutive All-Star and two Hurler of the Year accolades.
2012 began well for Fennelly when he collected a second league medal following a 3–21 to 0–16 demolition of old rivals Cork. Kilkenny were later shocked by Galway in the Leinster decider, losing by 2–21 to 2–11, however, both sides subsequently met in the All-Ireland decider on 9 September 2012. Kilkenny had led going into the final stretch, however, Joe Canning struck a stoppage time equaliser to level the game at 2–13 to 0–19 and send the final to a replay for the first time since 1959. The replay took place three weeks later on 30 September 2012. Galway stunned the reigning champions with two first-half goals, however, Kilkenny's championship debutant Walter Walsh gave a man of the match performance, claiming a 1–3 haul. The 3–22 to 3–11 Kilkenny victory gave Fennelly a fourth All-Ireland medal.
Kilkenny's dominance showed no sign of abating in 2013, Fennelly winning a third National League medal following a 2–17 to 0–20 defeat of Tipperary in the decider.
In 2014 Fennelly collected his fourth league medal, as Kilkenny secured a narrow one-point 2–25 to 1–27 extra-time victory over Tipperary. He missed much of the provincial campaign but was restored to the starting fifteen on 7 September 2014 when Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. In what some consider to be the greatest game of all-time, the sides were level when Tipperary were awarded a controversial free. John O'Dwyer had the chance to win the game, however, his late free drifted wide resulting in a draw. The replay on 27 September 2014 was also a close affair. Goals from brothers Richie and John Power inspired Kilkenny to a 2–17 to 2–14 victory. It was Fennelly's fifth All-Ireland medal.
An ongoing back injury hindered Fennelly's championship campaign in 2015, resulting in him missing Kilkenny's 1-25 to 2-15 defeat of Galway in the provincial decider. Fennelly fought his way back to full fitness as Kilkenny subsequently renewed their rivalry with Galway in the All-Ireland decider on 6 September 2015. The team struggled in the first half, however, a T. J. Reid goal and a dominant second half display, which limited Galway to just 1-4, saw Kilkenny power to a 1-22 to 1-18 victory. The victory gave Fennelly a sixth All-Ireland medal while he was also chosen as the man of the match.
On 13 August 2016, it was confirmed that Fennelly would miss the 2016 All-Ireland final after he ruptured his achilles tendon in the semi-final replay victory over Waterford.
In December 2017, Fennelly confirmed his retirement from Inter-County hurling. His last game was the 2017 qualifier defeat to Waterford on 8 July 2017 
Inter-provincial.
After a two-year hiatus and a period of uncertainty surrounding the competition, the Railway Cup returned in 2012 with Fennelly starting at midfield as Leinster faced Connacht in the decider. The game was effectively over at half time, with Leinster powering to an eventual 2–19 to 1–15 victory.
Managerial career.
Kildare (football coach).
In December 2018 it was announced that Fennelly had joined the Kildare senior football team's backroom team as their performance coach. Team manager Cian O'Neill defined his coaching role: "He will be working on those intangibles, like your team work, your coherence, resilience; he will be a great aid for me and the management team as regards to his observation role but most importantly for the players; he'll be there to observe them (players) when it matters mostly, at training and at matches giving feedback; one-on-ones; acting as a conduit between the players and management; it's a very broad role."
Offaly.
On 27 August 2019, it was announced that Fennelly had been proposed to become the next manager of the Offaly senior hurling team. He was officially ratified for the position at a meeting of the Offaly County Board on 3 September 2019. Fennelly's backroom team included Michael Kavanagh, David Kenny and Johnny Kelly. On 30 November 2019, Fennelly took charge of the Offaly senior team for the first time when he guided the team to a 2-28 to 0-18 defeat of Kildare in the Kehoe Cup. On 12 January 2020, he claimed his first silverware when Offaly defeated Antrim by 1-16 to 1-15 to win the Kehoe Cup.
In July 2022, Fennelly left his position as Offaly manager after three seasons in charge.
Personal life.
Born in Ballyhale, County Kilkenny, Fennelly is the member of a hurling dynasty from the locality. His grandfather, Kevin Fennelly, Snr, played with Kilkenny in the 1940s before later becoming heavily involved in the establishment of Ballyhale Shamrocks in 1972. His father, Mick, and his six uncles, Brendan, Ger, Kevin, Liam, Seán and Dermot, all played with the Shamrocks with several of them playing for Kilkenny at all levels.
Fennelly was educated at the local national school before later completing his Leaving Certificate at Scoil Aireagail. He subsequently completed a degree in business studies at the Cork Institute of Technology, before later becoming a bank official with Ulster Bank.
In 2012 Fennelly left his banking job and completed a one-year MSC in Sports Performance at the University of Limerick. After a three-month internship with the Sydney Swans, Fennelly subsequently took a position as a lecturer with Setanta College. As of 2016, he was a lecturer in nutrition at Limerick Institute of Technology.
Miscellaneous.
Upon retirement from playing, Fennelly became the player who has won the most All-Ireland winner's medals between club and county combined. In his collection he possesses sixteen All-Ireland medals: eight were won with the senior Kilkenny county team, five with his club Shamrocks Ballyhale, two with the Kilkenny under-21 hurling team and one with the Kilkenny minor hurling team.

War of the Colossal Beast

War of the Colossal Beast (a.k.a. Revenge of the Colossal Man and The Colossal Beast) is a 1958 black-and-white science fiction film, written, produced, and directed by Bert I. Gordon for his Carmel Productions, and starring Dean Parkin, Sally Fraser, and Roger Pace. It is the sequel to Gordon's earlier "The Amazing Colossal Man" (1957) and was distributed theatrically by American International Pictures as the bottom half of a double feature with "Attack of the Puppet People". The film's storyline picks up where "The Amazing Colossal Man" left off, although it was not marketed as a sequel and features a different cast. The film's brief death-scene finale was filmed in color.
Plot.
Upon hearing of several recent robberies of food delivery trucks in Mexico, Joyce Manning, Army Lt. Colonel Glenn Manning's sister, becomes convinced that her brother survived after being exposed to radiation from an atomic bomb (as seen in "The Amazing Colossal Man"). Along with Army Major Mark Baird and scientist Dr. Carmichael (Russ Bender), Joyce goes to Mexico to look for Glenn and finds that he has, in fact, survived, but was left disfigured and nearly mindless by the trauma of his fall. Glenn is eventually captured, drugged by the Army, and transported back to the United States. He is able to escape again and goes on a rampage through Los Angeles and Hollywood. He nearly kills a school bus full of children. Joyce reasons with him, and he slowly is brought back to his senses. Now realizing what he has become and what he has done, Glenn commits suicide by electrocuting himself on high-voltage power lines near the Griffith Observatory.
Production.
"War of the Colossal Beast" was produced, directed, and written by Bert I. Gordon and co-produced with Samuel Z. Arkoff. Although most of it is shot in black-and-white, the ending was shot in color for the electrocution scene and doctored in black-and-white. The producers decided to use the very heavy make-up on Dean Parkin as a way to disguise the fact that a different actor was playing Colonel Glenn Manning then in the previous installment "The Amazing Colossal Man", especially since a dream sequence flashing back to the original film featured Glenn Langan, the star of the earlier film. Dean Parkin also played the lead monster role in another Bert I. Gordon film, "The Cyclops".
Some of the tiny-sized props created for "The Amazing Colossal Man" by special effects technician Paul Blaisdell were featured again in this sequel via flashbacks.
Reception and legacy.
Contemporary film fan-historians Kim R. Holston and Tom Winchester noted that the film was "... a low-budget ship with Bert Gordon at the helm, so the special effects are unsurprisingly average; one always knows the 'giant' was filmed separately and mixed in with other shots".
"Mystery Science Theater 3000".
"War of the Colossal Beast" was featured in season 3, episode 19 of "Mystery Science Theater 3000".

Boris Verlinsky

Boris Markovich Verlinsky (8 January 1888 – 30 October 1950) was a Soviet chess player, who was awarded the title International Master by FIDE, the world chess federation, in 1950. He was one of the top Soviet players in the 1920s, and was Soviet champion in 1929.
Biography.
Verlinsky was born in Bakhmut, Ukraine. He was deaf as a result of meningitis as a youngster. In 1909, Verlinsky tied for 10th-11th in the All-Russian Amateur Tournament. in St. Petersburg. The event was won by Alexander Alekhine. In 1910, he won in Odessa. In 1911, he tied for 6-8th in St. Petersburg (Stepan Levitsky won). In 1912, he won the Odessa Championship. In 1913, he took 3rd in St. Petersburg behind winner Alexander Evenson.
After World War I, Verlinsky moved from Ukraine to Russia. In 1923, he tied for 1st with Kutuzov in Petrograd. In 1923, he took 2nd, behind Sergeev, in Petrograd. In 1924, he tied for 10-11th in Moscow (3rd USSR Chess Championship). The event was won by Efim Bogoljubov. In 1924, he took 2nd, behind Grigoriev, in Moscow (5th Moscow Championship). In 1925, he tied for 2nd-3rd, behind Sergeev, in Moscow (6th Moscow Championship). In August–September 1925, he took 4th in Leningrad (4th USSR Championship) – Bogoljubow won.
In November–December 1925, he tied for 12th-14th in Moscow (1st Moscow International Tournament) – the winner was Bogoljubow. But in this event, Verlinsky scored many beautiful wins over strong players, with perhaps the most impressive being his victory over World Champion José Raúl Capablanca with the Black pieces in a dazzling tactical display. In 1926, Verlinsky tied for 1st with Marsky in Odessa (3rd Ukraine Championship). In 1926, he tied for 8th-9th in Moscow (7th Moscow Championship) – Abram Rabinovich won. In 1928, he won the 9th Moscow City Championship.
In 1929, Boris Verlinsky won the 6th Soviet Championship in Odessa, at the time earning the title of grandmaster. The title was removed in 1931. It has been argued that this was done in order to make Mikhail Botvinnik the first Soviet grandmaster.
According to the site chessmetrics.com, Verlinsky was rated at 2627 in May 1926, and this placed him 16th in the world at that time. Chessmetrics provides historical ratings for players and events throughout chess history. Official ratings were introduced by FIDE only in 1970.
In 1930, Verlinsky took 7th in Moscow (Abram Rabinovich won). In November 1931, he tied for 3rd-6th in Moscow (7th USSR Championship), with a solid score of 10/17 – Botvinnik won. In February 1933, he took 2nd, behind Fedor Bogatyrchuk, in Moscow (Quadrangular). In 1933/34, he took 12th in Moscow (14th Moscow Championship).
Verlinsky was less active at chess in his later life, but could still provide a competitive test for strong masters. After many years away from top competition, he attempted to qualify for the Soviet Championship final in 1945, at age 57, but could only manage 4.5/15 in the semi-final, and did not advance. However, he defeated rising star Bronstein in this event. Verlinsky's last major competitive event was the 1945 Moscow Championship, where he scored 5/16.
Verlinsky was awarded the International Master title by FIDE in 1950, the same year he died at age 62 in Moscow.
Style and legacy.
Verlinsky was strong in the classical openings with both colours. At his peak, he won against Alexander Alekhine, José Raúl Capablanca, Efim Bogolyubov, Grigory Levenfish, Akiba Rubinstein, Rudolf Spielmann, and David Bronstein, among others. He was Jewish. Just like majority of other Russian/Soviet masters - Verlinsky never got a chance to compete outside the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union.

Nakamura Incident

The refers to the extrajudicial killing of Imperial Japanese Army Captain Shintarō Nakamura and three others, on 27 June 1931 by Chinese soldiers in Manchuria.
Background.
Captain Nakamura, a regular Japanese Army officer, was on an official mission under orders of the Kwantung Army detachment in the South Manchurian Railway Zone. Early in June, Captain Nakamura obtained a "huzhao" (護照, passport) from the Chinese authorities in Mukden, which allowed him and his party rights of free passage through Manchuria, with the exception of the militarily-sensitive border area between Taonan and Solun (in the Xing'an Colonization Area). At Harbin, however, Nakamura obtained a second "huzhao" which, according to the Japanese Consul General, gave the desired permission to travel in the Taonan-Solun area.
Captain Nakamura was accompanied by Nobutarō Isugi, a retired Japanese army sergeant, a Mongolian and a Russian interpreter. Nakamura was travelling incognito, in civilian dress, and represented himself as an "agricultural expert". The party of four left Pokotu on the Chinese Eastern Railway about the middle of June, their immediate destination being Taonan. Nakamura made stops along the Chinese Eastern Railway, at Manzhouli, Qiqihar, Angangehi, and Hailar taking notes.
On 27 June 1931, the members of the party were arrested by Northeastern Army soldiers under the command of Kuan Yuheng outside Taonan, in a place called Suokungfu. According to the Chinese, Nakamura was armed and carried patent medicines, which included narcotic drugs for non-medical purposes. He and his assistants were taken to Solun, where they were summarily executed on July 1 and their bodies immediately cremated to conceal evidence of the deed. The execution may have been ordered because the Chinese had discovered that Nakamura's mission was one of espionage to find water sources and places for encampment for future Japanese military operations in northwest Manchuria.
Consequences.
Details of the incident became known to the Japanese public on 17 August 1931. With the news coming soon after the Wanpaoshan Incident, public opinion was further inflamed, increasing anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan. The Japanese military was quick to capitalize on this upsurge in public opinion to demand a stronger foreign policy against China. Some influential and outspoken officers, including Kanji Ishiwara, demanded that the incident be used as a "casus belli" to enable the Japanese Army to resolve Japan's position in Manchuria. Chinese authorities eventually agreed to investigate the case, and (per the Lytton Report) diplomatic progress appeared to be made until the Manchurian Incident later that year.
Nakamura was posthumously awarded the Order of the Golden Kite (4th class).

Bakasura

Bakasura (, ), also rendered Baka, is a rakshasa featured in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The rakshasa lives in a forest which nowadays known as "Gangani" located near Garhbeta town of the Indian state of West Bengal. In exchange for protecting the kingdom from invaders, he terrorises its citizens, eating them at will. The weak king is rendered helpless. The people come to an arrangement with their tormentor: They would send him large provisions of food every week, which he would consume, along with the cart-driver who delivered them. In order to save the life of their Brahmin host when it is his turn to deliver the cartload, Bhima is eventually sent out to kill Bakasura, under the direction of his mother, Kunti.
The slaying of Bakasura by Bhima is commemorated on the occasion of Bhimana Amavasya.
History.
Pandavas and Kunti travelled to Ekachakrapura after Bhima's wedding to Hidimbi, welcomed in the house of a Brahmin family. One day, Kunti heard the lamentations of the members of the family, and sought to identify the source of their distress. She overheard the husband speak of his woe that he would have to sacrifice himself in order to protect his wife and children. His wife, daughter, and son all desired to be the ones to sacrifice themselves for the sake of their family. Curious, Kunti approached them and sought some details regarding their troubles. The Brahmin informed her of the rakshasa named Bakasura, who defended the people from attackers, in exchange for a weekly delivery of a cartload of food. The person who delivered the cartload would also be devoured by the rakshasa. Disturbed, Kunti declared that no Brahmin should have to die for the depredations of the creature, and that her son, Bhima, would go in their stead. She assured the Brahmins that Bhima was of great prowess. Bhima immediately agreed to vanquish the rakshasa in gratitude for his hosts. That night, he was dispatched with the food that was to be delivered to the rakshasa, and carried the cartload to the forest, where Bakasura dwelt. The aroma of the food overpowered the Pandava so much that he started to consume it. When Bakasura saw his provisions being consumed, he was enraged, and rushed to attack Bhima. The two uprooted trees and hurled them at each other, and then proceeded to drag each other against the earth. Finally, Bakasura grew tired, and Bhima was able to plunge his knee against the former's spine, breaking his body into two. When Bakasura's friends and family arrived and grew terrified by the sight, Bhima assured them that they would be safe as long as they gave up human flesh, to which they agreed. Bhima secretly placed Bakasura's corpse upon the cartload near the town's gates and described the incident to the grateful Brahmins.

Baby T-Rex

Baby T-Rex is a platform game developed by Beam Software for Game Boy. It was released in 1993 in Europe by Laser Beam Entertainment, Beam's publishing arm. It was also released (with altered graphics and story) as Agro Soar in Australia, as Bamse in Sweden, and as We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story in North America, where it was published by Hi Tech Expressions.
The following year Beam released a remake, "Radical Rex", for Super NES, Sega Genesis and Sega CD.
Gameplay.
In the original "Baby T-Rex" version of the game, players control an anthropomorphic skateboarding dinosaur, who must traverse various levels in order to save his girlfriend from the evil wizard Sethron. In the "Agro Soar" version of the game, players control Agro as he tries to escape a "pre-historic cartoon within his own TV" in which he is trapped by Sethron after he had insulted the wizard while watching the television show "Curse of Sethron".
The "Bamse" version of the game sees Bamse, the world's strongest bear, and his rabbit friend Lille Skutt rescuing the inventor tortoise Skalman from the mischievous wolf Vargen after Skalman transports them 75 millions of years back in time, to the age of the dinosaurs in a time machine he had built.
The "We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story" version of the game sees players control Rex, a "Tyrannosaurus rex" with enhanced intelligence who must rescue his three dinosaur friends Woog, Elsa and Dweeb from the film's villain Professor Screweyes.
Development.
Beam actively sought to adapt the game for a number of different licensed properties in different countries around the world. Subsequently, the game was also released as "We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story", based on the 1993 film of the same name in North America, "Bamse", based on the Swedish children's character Bamse and the comics featuring him, in Sweden, and "Agro Soar", which stars the puppet children's television show host Agro from Beam's home country of Australia. These versions changed the story and the graphics (most notably the main character sprite, cutscenes and the title screen) to fit the license but kept the gameplay, level design and music intact.
Beam had also unsuccessfully pitched versions featuring the characters Sooty, Hugo and The Smurfs at various European trade fairs. A version of the game featuring Edd the Duck was completed and reviewed by "Game Zone" magazine in Britain but was pulled from distribution just before release when the BBC revoked the license. Decades later a ROM of the game was leaked onto the internet as part of the 2020 Nintendo data leak.
The game uses an in-house developed engine that was previously used in a "Tom and Jerry" game.
Reception.
All versions of the game received average reviews.

Canna 'Florence Vaughan'

"Canna" 'Florence Vaughan' is a medium Crozy Group canna cultivar; green foliage, oval shaped, branching habit; oval stems, coloured green; flowers are open, yellow with red spots, staminodes are medium size, edges regular, fully self-cleaning; fertile both ways, not self-pollinating or true to type, capsules globose; rhizomes are thick, up to 3 cm in diameter, coloured white; tillering is average. Introduced by A. Crozy, Lyon, France in 1892.
In the 1990s there was confusion over this heritage cultivar and an Italian Group cultivar with pale yellow background and orange blobs (correctly called C. 'Roma') was widely called by this name. Several other similar Italian Group cultivars were also given this name as a synonym, but examination of the evidence from early adverts and catalogues shows there is no grounds for confusing these cultivars with C. 'Florence Vaughan'.

Centro direzionale di Napoli

The Centro direzionale (Italian for "Managerial Center") is a business district in Naples, Italy close to the Napoli Centrale railway station. Designed by the Japanese architect Kenzō Tange, the entire complex was completed in 1995. It is the first cluster of skyscrapers to have been built in Italy or southern Europe.
History.
The project of the "Centro direzionale" dates back to 1964. It was designed in 1982 by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange.
The district’s origins date back to the mid-sixties, when the Municipality of Naples identified an abandoned industrial area of approximately to be used for the construction of a new neighborhood, mainly for office use, to relieve congestion in the city center.
After numerous projects, none of which were finally approved, in 1982 everything was entrusted to the famous Japanese architect Kenzō Tange. About three years after the presentation of his project, the construction work started.
The construction of the skyscrapers was entrusted to internationally renowned architects: among others, Renzo Piano designed the Olivetti building, Massimo Pica Ciamarra, along with a team of qualified architects, designed the two ENEL towers, and Nicola Pagliara designed the towers of the Banco di Napoli as well as the Palazzo dell'Edilres.
The realization was carried out by the company Mededil S.p.A., IRI-Italstat group.
Structure.
The structure is characterized by the wide road axis at the centre of the complex on which there are piazza of various shapes (circular, quadrangular, etc.) and dimensions, some of which are equipped with fountains.
Below this main street there are numerous parking lots, escalators and road arteries serving the traffic connecting the most peripheral part of the architectural complex with the city centre.
The Telecom Italia Tower at 129 metres in height, is the tallest building in southern Italy, and the ninth tallest building in Italy. For 15 years, from 1995 to 2010 it was the tallest building in Italy, exceeding by 2 metres the Pirellone of Milan.
Seen from the Vomero hill, the entire complex appears in marked contrast to the antiquities of the historic centre of Naples and with Vesuvius in the background.
The management center also houses the new headquarters of the Faculty of Engineering and Science and Technology of the University of Naples "Parthenope".
The center is one of the most extensive and important city works built in recent decades. Inspired by the ideas of Le Corbusier, represents a first positive example of clear separation between underground car traffic and surface pedestrian area.
The whole complex is said to bring a tone of renewal and modernity to the city, revitalizing the skyline. It is considered one of the most extensive and impressive urban agglomerations of skyscrapers in southern Europe to date.
The area has become attractive to companies, allowing them to effectively interface with each other in a single complex dedicated to business.
Location.
The complex is located in Naples between the central station, Vicaria side, and Piazza Nazionale. Although the structure is entirely within the Poggioreale district, there is a Polizia di Stato station called "Vasto - Arenaccia".
The center is accessible from Via Giovanni Porzio, a road that runs from Corso Malta to Corso Meridionale, making a corner with this and Via Taddeo da Sessa: this is the main entrance to the district, so much so that the most used address for correspondence is "via Giovanni Porzio, 4.” This number seems to be arbitrary, because it is not posted anywhere and because on the office building on the same side of the street there is nothing.
The area can also be accessed from via Francesco Lauria, via Domenico Aulisio, via Costantino Grimaldi, piazza Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino (formerly piazza Enrico Cenni, which is what is shown on the street map of the City of Naples despite the change of the street sign), via Serafino Biscardi and Piazza Salerno. Some of these entrances enter directly into the structures of the new courthouse.
Internal naming.
Inside the business district, most of the buildings are marked by a code consisting of a letter and a number, sometimes separated by a slash: the letter indicates the block, the number is the lot inside that block. The blocks range from A to G. For some buildings, names are used instead.
The district also uses its own street naming system, rather than municipal numbering. The exception is largo Kagoshima, which is the only name indicated by the Commune's official street sign, and while this name appears on the "stradario" (street listing) of the municipality, it is not shown on street maps, including Google's.
Complex.
The ENEL Towers are often referred to as the Twin Towers of Naples due to their similarity.
Transportation.
The district is served by two public transport stations: the Centro Direzionale station on Naples Metro Line 1, and the on the Circumvesuviana railway.

Jim Saleam

James Saleam (; born 18 September 1955) is an Australian far-right extremist who is currently the chairman of the Australia First Party. He came to prominence after founding National Action, a militant white nationalist organization active in Sydney during the 1980s.
The son of Lebanese immigrants to Australia, Saleam attended Maryborough State High School, where he developed his interest in politics and nationalism. By 1970, he joined the National Socialist Party of Australia and two years later he was arrested for the fire-bombing of a Maoist bookshop. During the 70s, Saleam joined and founded minor nationalist organisations, and in 1982 he founded National Action.
Following the foundation of National Action, Saleam quickly gained national notoriety in the Australian nationalist scene. The organization advocated for a nationalist agenda and frequently engaged in tactics like direct action. National Action's activities often led to clashes with opposing groups and law enforcement. In 1989, while a member of said organization, Saleam was arrested for his involvement in orchestrating a shotgun attack on the home of an African National Congress representative in Australia.
Despite these setbacks, he continued to promote his nationalist ideology. In the late 1990s, after serving time in prison, Saleam obtained both an MA and PhD from the University of Sydney by writing two theses on the far-right in America and Australia. He would join the Australia First Party in 2002, where he worked as the secretary of the Sydney branch. By 2010, he became the chairman of the party. Under his leadership, the party has maintained a staunchly anti-immigration stance. Saleam has been a strong advocate of barring further immigration to preserve a "self-contained, predominantly white nation resistant to further immigration or watering-down of its culture", and has supported reintroducing the White Australia policy.
Life.
Early years: 1955–1972.
Saleam was born and raised in Maryborough, Queensland, 18 September 1955, to a family of Lebanese immigrants. His grandfather, George Saleam, was born in Lebanon and fled his country at age 16, boarding a ship bound for Australia. After arriving to Marybourgh, George was classed as a white person. Jim's parents divorced in the 1960s, when he was an eight-year-old. After the break-up, his mother left with his sister to another town, leaving Saleam with his father. Saleam has described his father as an apolitical person, being not “academically minded or interested in politics or history”. However, he let his son read and study.
Saleam attended Maryborough State High School, which at the time worked as a segregated boys and girls high school. At the age of 15, Saleam developed his early interest in politics, writing to “every conceivable political organisation in the country”, both from the left and the right. Malcolm Fraser’s election as PM led towards his exposure to nationalism and far-right politics, after he realised “both sides were in cahoots and that there was a need for a radical third way”. According to Dr. Michael Monsour, a local doctor from Saleam's hometown, he developed certain fascination with the Nazis and was controversial for painting swastikas and portraying the roman salute. Despite being a troublemaker, Saleam was also described as "academically gifted". His final school exams were passed with ease, earning him a scholarship to the University of Queensland.
In 1970, Saleam joined the National Socialist Party of Australia. His role as a regular contributor to party funding earned him the nickname of ‘Comrade Saleam’. He became an assistant editor of "Stormtrooper" and the "National Socialist Bulletin", where he often emphasised the ‘socialism’ in ‘National Socialism’. As a NSPA militant, in 1972, Saleam firebombed a far-left, Maoist bookshop in Brisbane and, two years later, he was found guilty and arrested. His sentence banned him from having any association with the NSPA.
Political activism: 1974–1982.
After his release from prison, Saleam moved to Sydney and enrolled at the Sydney University. In 1975, in Brisbane, Saleam was pictured by an "Australasian Spartacist" photographer in an anti-Pinochet demonstration organized by the NSPA, wearing a swastika armband. According to him, he would join back to the NSPA but as an infiltrator as an attempt to prove the organization members were agents of the special branch of the Queensland police.
On Anzac Day 1982, he co-founded National Action (NA), which eventually collapsed due to Saleam's convictions for property offences and fraud in 1984, possession of a prohibited article - a large nail-studded club in 1985, and for organising a shotgun attack in 1989 on African National Congress Australian representative Eddie Funde, for which he served three and a half years in prison. 
After his release from prison, Saleam was awarded a PhD in politics from the University of Sydney by writing a thesis entitled "The Other Radicalism: An Inquiry into Contemporary Australian Extreme Right Ideology, Politics And Organization 1975–1995" (submitted in December 1999).
Saleam was affiliated with the Patriotic Youth League, and has been seen associating with neo-Nazi skinheads. In 2004, Saleam contested the NSW local government elections, and ran for Marrickville Council on an anti-refugee platform. In 2012, he ran for NSW local government election in the City of Blue Mountains.
Australia First Party.
Saleam was the Secretary of the Sydney branch of the Australia First Party (AFP) between 2002 and 2007, when he became its chairman, and sought to re-establish the party. In July 2009, he announced that it had reached its target of 500 members and was registering the New South Wales branch party with the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). The party was reregistered in mid-2010, in time to contest the 2010 federal election.
AFP contested the 2013 federal election, Saleam standing in the seat of Cook on a platform to end refugee intakes, running against Scott Morrison. He received 617 votes, or 0.67% of the vote.
On 14 July 2015, the AEC deregistered the AFP due to its failure to demonstrate the required number of members. It was reregistered on 1 March 2016 as "Australia First Party (NSW) Incorporated".
Saleam stood at the 2016 federal election in the seat of Lindsay and received 1068 votes or 1.2% of the vote. He stood for AFP in the 2018 Longman by-election, receiving 709 votes or 0.8% of the vote.
Saleam stood in the seat of Cootamundra, New South Wales, in the 2017 by-election as an independent, though still a member of Australia First, as the party is not registered for state elections. He received 453 votes, 1% of the total. He again stood in the seat at the 2019 New South Wales state election as an independent, receiving 0.95% of the vote. Saleam's platform included the reintroduction of the White Australia policy and opposition to Chinese immigration.
Saleam stood at the 2019 federal election and the 2025 federal election in the seat of Lindsay and received 1,372 votes or 1.41% of the vote in 2019 and 1,103 or 1.13% of the vote in 2025.
Personal life.
Saleam married Jane Mengler in 1987. They had two children and divorced in 1994.

Remu Aaltonen

Henry Olavi "Remu" Aaltonen (born 10 January 1948) is a Finnish drummer and singer. He is the lead musician of the band Hurriganes, but has also pursued a solo singing career.
Early life.
Aaltonen was born in Helsinki. He was the oldest child in a family of seven siblings and one foster child. He is of Romani descent. For a while the family lived in an abandoned train car in Ruskeasanta, Vantaa near the construction of the Helsinki Airport. The living conditions of Romani people in Finland only started improving in the 1970s.
The family's father Otto Aaltonen was an alcoholic who was not always around, and the mother Eeva sold moonshine to support them. Aaltonen got his nickname "Remu" in his youth. The nickname most likely comes from the Finnish verb "remuta", meaning to make a lot of noise. "The big boys gave me the name when we were playing football. But I was never such a big noisemaker", says Aaltonen.
Aaltonen was 16 years old and already playing in various bands when he received his first prison sentence for burglaries and other property crimes in 1964. He has also received convictions for drug possession.
Musical career.
Aaltonen was inspired by blues music from the United States already in his youth. Although his formal musical training was limited to music lessons at school, by the early 1970s he had already been playing with various other artists, such as the brothers Kirka and Sammy Babitzin.
After Aaltonen had been fired from his band Kalevala because of a prison sentence, he founded a new band called Hurriganes together with bass player Cisse Häkkinen and guitarist Albert Järvinen. Aaltonen is the only remaining original member of the band.
In 1974, Hurriganes had to pause their tour for a few months while Aaltonen was in prison. Aaltonen has said that his music career saved him from a life of crime.
Recognition and awards.
In 2018, Aaltonen was awarded the Suomi-palkinto (Finland Award) by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture as a recognition of an impactful career in the field of arts.

French military mission to Japan (1867–1868)

The French military mission of 1867 to 1868 was one of the first foreign military training missions to Japan, and the first sent by France. The mission was formed by emperor Napoléon III following a request from the Tokugawa shogunate through its emissary to Europe, Shibata Takenaka, with the goal of modernizing the Japanese military.
Shibata was already negotiating the final details of the French support for the construction of the Yokosuka Shipyard, and had additionally requested both the United Kingdom and France to send a military mission for training in Western warfare. The United Kingdom provided support to the Bakufu naval forces through the Tracey Mission. The French foreign minister Drouyn de Lhuys transmitted the agreement of the French government to provide training to the Shōgun's land-based armed forces.
History.
The mission left Marseille on November 19, 1866, and arrived in Yokohama on January 14, 1867. They were welcomed on their arrival by Léon Roches and the commander of the French Far East Squadron Admiral Pierre-Gustave Roze.
The military mission was able to train an elite corps of "shōgun" Tokugawa Yoshinobu, the Denshūtai, for a little more than one year, before the Tokugawa shogunate lost to the Imperial forces in 1868 in the Boshin War. The French military mission was then ordered to leave Japan by decree of the newly installed Meiji Emperor in October 1868.
In contravention of the agreement for all foreign powers to remain neutral in the conflict, French military officer Jules Brunet and four of his non-commissioned officers (Fortant, Marlin, Cazeneuve, Bouffier), chose to remain in Japan and continue supporting the Bakufu side. They resigned from the French army and left for the north of Japan with the remains of the Shogunate's armies in the hope of staging a counterattack.
The conflict continued until the rebels' defeat at the Battle of Hakodate in May 1869.
Members.
The mission consisted of 17 members, under the authority of the Minister of War General Jacques Louis Randon, covering a wide range of expertise: four officers (representing infantry, artillery and cavalry), ten non-commissioned officers and two soldiers. The original mission composed of 15 members, arriving in Japan in January 1867, and was later supplemented with non-commissioned officers Cazeneuve, Jourdan and Michel (February 1868). The mission was headed by staff captain Charles Sulpice Jules Chanoine, at that time an attaché to the military staff of Paris. The members were:

The Little Hut

The Little Hut is a 1957 British romantic comedy film made by MGM starring Ava Gardner, Stewart Granger and David Niven. It was directed by Mark Robson, produced by Robson and F. Hugh Herbert, from a screenplay by Herbert, adapted by Nancy Mitford from the play "La petite hutte" by André Roussin.
Plot.
High-flying tycoon Sir Philip Ashlow (Granger), his neglected wife, Lady Susan Ashlow (Gardner) and his best friend, pettifogger civil servant Henry Brittingham-Brett (Niven), are shipwrecked on a desert island.
Susan feels neglected and has been trying to make Philip jealous by demonstrating a romantic interest in Henry, who begins taking her seriously. Now that they are alone on the island, Philip constructs a large hut for his wife and himself and a little hut for Henry, but before long Henry is suggesting they share not only food and water but Susan as well.
Opposed to this, Susan nevertheless is offended by Philip's indifferent reaction to Henry's indecent proposal. The quarrel escalates until Philip declares that, as captain of their ship, he feels entitled not only to perform marriages but to grant divorces. He awaits Susan's decision on whether the men should change huts or share and share alike.
This potential ménage à trois where the two men are competing for the lady's attention is interrupted by a fourth visitor. The stranger is dressed in native garb and takes Susan captive, but is soon revealed to be Mario, the chef from their yacht, indulging a whim. The laughter from inside the hut between Susan and Mario is misinterpreted by Henry and her husband as being romantic in nature, arousing jealousy from both men.
After their rescue and return to society, Henry comes to visit Susan to propose they be together. But when he finds her and Philip in domestic repose, and Susan knitting baby booties, he knows the battle for her love is lost.
Original play.
The script of "The Little Hut" was written by the French writer André Roussin, based on his own play "La petite hutte" (1947). Both play and script are based on another play in Catalan, written by the novelist and playwright Carles Soldevila (1892–1967): "Civilitzats tanmateix" ("Nevertheless civilized") (1921). This play was known in France through a translation by Adolphe de Faigairolle and Francesc Presas, published in 1927 in the magazine "Candide".
The play ran for over 1,500 performances in Paris, was translated into English by Nancy Mitford and ran for three years in the West End, starting in 1950 with Robert Morley and David Tomlinson (with Roger Moore as their understudy) at the Lyric Theatre before being made into the film.
The play flopped on Broadway in 1953 despite being directed by Peter Brook. Robert Morley was unable to reprise his performance in New York due to a tax situation.
In 2010, the play was revived starring Aden Gillett and Janie Dee.
Production.
There was reluctance to obtain the screen rights due to concern about censorship. In February 1955 F Hugh Herbert and Mark Robson announced they had formed a company to purchase the film rights to the play and make a movie from it.
Herbert had written "The Moon Is Blue", which had famously been released without a seal of approval from the Production Code. However Herbert said "after that episode I was determined not to make another picture without a seal."
The screenplay made a number of changes from the play. In the play, the affair was real, but in the film. the wife only pretended to get her husband interested in her. Robson said Herbert had proved with "The Moon Is Blue" that the censors did not mind if characters "talked about sex as much as you want – as long as nothing happens." The boyfriend became an old admirer of the woman, and the woman and her husband were given a divorce on board the ship. Also a dog was added to interrupt any potential sex moments.
Herbert completed the script by January 1956 and David Niven, Noël Coward and Clifton Webb were being discussed for the male leads. Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer were also discussed. By April, the lead roles had been cast: Niven, Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger. They made the film independently but did a deal with MGM to finance which involved MGM loaning their contract players Stewart Granger and Ava Gardner.
Herbert said it "doesn't matter much where we make the film since 75% of it takes place on a desert island."
It was planned to shoot the whole film in England, but a shortage of suitable studio space made this impossible. The film was shot in England and Italy over August to September 1956, with six weeks filming at the Cinecittà Studios in Rome and some background filming in Italy. Post production was done in England.
Reception.
According to MGM records, the film earned $2,085,000 in North America and $1,515,000 elsewhere, making a profit of $340,000.
It did not perform well at the French box office with admissions of only 591,767.
Mark Robson signed Walter Chiari to a five-picture contract on the basis of his performance calling him a "new Maurice Chevalier".

PBA on Vintage Sports

PBA on Vintage Sports is a Philippine television sports presentation show broadcast by City2, MBS/PTV and IBC. It aired from March 7, 1982, to December 12, 1999. The consist of branding used for presentation of Philippine Basketball Association games produced by Vintage Sports.
History.
In 1982, the PBA awarded the broadcast rights of its games to Vintage Enterprises, Inc., a company owned by Carlos "Bobong" Velez and signed a P5.4 million deal with the league.
Games were aired on City2 Television, with the second game of a doubleheader aired live and the first game followed afterwards on a delayed basis. One play-by-play and one analyst was assigned to cover both games.
For the first three years of Vintage's coverage, they had the legendary sports commentator Joe Cantada and Pinggoy Pengson as its main anchors with Steve Kattan and Andy Jao as the analysts. Future PBA commissioner Jun Bernardino served as the sideline reporter (dubbed as the "Man on the Ball"). Occasional analysts were also added in the panel, which includes Freddie Webb, Norman Black and Joaqui Trillo.
Several innovations were added by Vintage to the PBA coverage compared to their predecessor, including the "Man on the Ball" feature, which acts as a sideline reporter, "Inside Basketball", which discusses the basketball fundamentals (hosted by Steve Kattan, then later Norman Black), and "Winner's Profile", a feature segment about the players during their off-the-court activities. They also changed the delivery of the panelists by bringing out insights from the action in the game with less emphasis on play-by-play.
The orientation of the main camera was changed since the 1983 Open Conference, with the team benches moved at the bottom of the screen. This is to accommodate additional advertisement when the main camera pans at the basketball court. Team huddles during timeouts were also included since 1984.
After the PBA's transfer to The ULTRA in 1985, Ronnie Nathanielsz, Sev Sarmenta and Ed Picson were later added as additional play-by-play commentators. In 1986, City2 (BBC) went off the air after the EDSA People Power Revolution and Vintage transferred its broadcasts to the People's Television Network as their partner.
In 1987, Vintage started airing PBA doubleheaders live, and they assign a different play-by-play commentator for both games, although the analyst will still cover both games. Beginning in 1988, Romy Kintanar did the halftime features, entitled "Kaypee at the Half".
Starting the 1989 All-Filipino Conference, Vintage used a character generator score bug, which replaced the "keyed" score bug used since 1982. A dedicated camera was also designated for the game clock so it can be superimposed with the score bug. This was done on a sporadic basis in 1984 and 1986. A CG game clock was used for the 1987 season.
After Cantada's death in March 1992, Ed Picson, Sev Sarmenta and Bill Velasco became the main anchors with Quinito Henson, Andy Jao and Butch Maniego as color commentators. Later additions were Jimmy Javier and Noli Eala (who served as an analyst first then becoming a play-by-play commentator in 1995). Starting in 1993, a different game analyst was assigned for doubleheaders.
In 1996, Vintage transferred to Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) as part of the launching of Vintage Television, a prime time slot that aired on IBC. They also changed the main language in delivering the games, from an all-English format to taglish (mixed Tagalog and English). Radio commentators such as Chino Trinidad, Rado Dimalibot, and Randy Sacdalan were elevated to TV broadcast.
Over the next three seasons, Vintage paid the league a total of over two billion pesos (135 million in 1997, 1.885 billion in 1998 and over 300 million in 1999).
From 1997 to 1998, the games are also aired at ESPN Asia. A different panel were assigned for the ESPN broadcast, which usually headed by Ronnie Nathanielsz.
By 1998, Sarmenta, Velasco and Maniego left for ABS-CBN Sports to be the main presenters for the network's newly established league, the Metropolitan Basketball Association (MBA). Trinidad and Yeng Guiao would also become one of the most popular tandems in Vintage Sports. Eala and Picson would often be tandem with Henson and Jao. Radio commentators Benjie Santiago and Mon Liboro was also elevated to the TV coverage.
In 1999, Anthony Suntay and Chiqui Roa-Puno, or at times Paolo Trillo, Jannelle So and Dong Alejar became the pregame and halftime hosts for the coverage. Also, the games were aired on Eagle Broadcasting Corporation's Net 25 on a slightly delayed basis.
End of "PBA on Vintage Sports".
On December 12, 1999, Vintage Sports aired its last PBA game during Game 6 of the 1999 Governors' Cup finals between the Alaska Milkmen and the San Miguel Beermen were played at the Araneta Coliseum and before merging with Viva TV in 2000. Ed Picson and Andy Jao were the commentators and the sideline reporters were Ronnie Nathanielsz, Jannelle So Chiqui Roa-Puno and Dong Alejar for its last run.
Viva Entertainment merger.
In 2000, Vintage Television merged with Viva Television and signed a 770 million pesos deal with 3 years. It defeated the bid of GMA Network, who was hoping to win the bid to compete with television rival ABS-CBN, who had the television rights to cover the rival league Metropolitan Basketball Association.
Music.
Vintage Sports used different themes in every season the covered the PBA games. During their first years covering the league, they incorporate pop music when cutting into a commercial break. The list of their main themes are as follows:

George S. Messersmith

George Strausser Messersmith (October 3, 1883 – January 29, 1960) was a United States ambassador to Austria, Cuba, Mexico, and Argentina. Messersmith also served as head of the consulate in Germany from 1930 to 1934, during the rise of the Nazi Party.
He was best known in his day for his controversial decision to issue a visa to Albert Einstein to travel to the United States. He is also known today for his diplomatic handling of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson, later Duke and Duchess of Windsor, in the era before World War II.
Education and early career.
Messersmith, a graduate of Keystone State Normal School, was a teacher and then school administrator from 1900 to 1914. Then, he entered the foreign service and left his position as vice president of the Delaware State Board of Education to become US consul in Fort Erie, Ontario.
After serving as a US consul at Curacao (1916–1919) and Antwerp (1919–1925), he became US Consul General for Belgium and Luxembourg in 1925. He served as US Consul General in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 1928 to 1930.
Consul for Berlin.
In 1930, Messersmith left his position in Argentina to accept the same position in Berlin. There, he became responsible for administering the annual German quota.
While he did not personally interview Albert Einstein, Messersmith cleared the way for the scientist to leave Germany. He called Einstein himself to tell him that his visa would be ready. Messersmith received significant notoriety in late 1932 due to the incident.
Messersmith told the American consuls in Europe that refugees or immigrants requesting a visa to enter the US had to have sufficient funds and property to support themselves.
As America's consul general in Berlin in 1933, Messersmith wrote a dispatch to the State Department that dramatically contravened the popular view that Hitler had no consensus among the German people and would not remain in power:
Minister to Austria.
His service in Germany ended in February 1934, when President Franklin Roosevelt nominated him to be US Ambassador to Uruguay, only to renominate him the next month as Minister to Austria before his service in Uruguay could begin.
On January 17, 1935, Edward Albert (later Edward VIII), the Prince of Wales, was visiting Vienna on vacation with his new mistress, Wallis Simpson. While Simpson went shopping, Edward met with President Wilhelm Miklas and Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg of Austria. Messersmith had spies at the meeting who reported to the State Department through him on the meeting's goal: solidifying the Balkan Pact.
When Edward abdicated in December 1936, he visited Messersmith, who spied on him, in Vienna and made "what amounted to a detailed watching brief on the duke." They became friends, even attending Christmas Day services together later that month.
Messersmith continued to socialize with Edward, attending a concert by soprano Joan Hammond on February 3, 1937. That month, Edward confided in him that the Earl of Harewood, his brother-in-law, had treated him "shabbily." After the Duke and the Duchess of Windsor were married in June 1937, they honeymooned in Austria, and Simpson confided to Messersmith about her bitterness towards the American media.
In return, Messersmith accidentally leaked through them that the Americans knew that Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy had secret connections as early as that month. When Messersmith returned to Washington, D.C., in August 1937, he informed the British authorities that the Windsors had Nazi connections, which "would seriously affect the Windsors' entire future."
Later career.
From 1937 to 1940, between his appointments as Minister to Austria and Ambassador to Cuba, he served as a US Assistant Secretary of State. As chief of the Foreign Service Promotion Board, Messersmith had to go over all appointments with President Roosevelt and in the process learned that Roosevelt had excellent intelligence on several foreign service officers with problems, including alcohol or affairs.
While Messersmith served as United States Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Cuba, he wrote a report on March 4, 1941, about the Windsors' friend, James D. Mooney, and was critical of the General Motors executive's opinions against England. He considered that Mooney was "dangerous... for the Duke and Duchess of Windsor to be associated with." However, the Windsors visited Mooney in Detroit in November 1941, the month before the attack on Pearl Harbor.
Later, he was appointed United States Ambassador to Mexico, where he passed on information about the Windsors' Nazi connections to Assistant Secretary of State Adolph A. Berle. Messersmith "no longer adhered to his moderate view of the duke and duchess.". During his tenure, in 1942, he helped establish the Benjamin Franklin Library in Mexico City and The American Society of Mexico, an umbrella group to help coordinate the whole American community in Mexico.
Following the forced resignation of Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles in 1943, Messersmith, then Ambassador to Mexico, was rumored to be on a short list of candidates to succeed him, but Roosevelt instead selected future Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, Jr.
Legacy.
Messersmith's collection of papers has been digitized and made available to researchers by the University of Delaware. The digitization project was made possible through a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC).

Sääksmäki

Sääksmäki is a former municipality, currently part of Valkeakoski in the Pirkanmaa region of Western Finland. A past president of Finland, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, the Finnish film producer and director Veikko Aaltonen, eminent Finnish historian Eino Jutikkala, and actress Pirkko Mannola, were born there.
Sääksmäki's most famous building is the medieval stone Sääksmäki Church, built at the end of the 15th century. It is one of the oldest buildings in Finland. It features wooden sculptures that were created by an anonymous artist, known as the "Master of Sääksmäki". Sääksmäki's architecture also includes manor houses that date back hundreds of years.
History.
The name "Sääksmäki" means "osprey hill". It was mentioned in 1340 in a papal bull by Pope Benedict XII, in which he excommunicated 25 peasants from Sääksmäki as they had not paid their taxes. The excommunication was requested by the Bishop of Turku, Henricus Hartmanni. This letter provides some information on contemporary Finnish names, though their written forms do not accurately represent their actual pronunciations. 
Saarioispuoli.
The southern part of Sääksmäki, divided from the main part of Sääksmäki by the lake Vanajavesi, is known as Saarioispuoli. The area was ecclesiastically subordinate to Sääksmäki, but has been an administrative unit called "Saarioinen" since the 14th century.
Akaa (with Toijala and Kylmäkoski) was originally a division of Saarioinen and the Akaa parish established in 1483 was sometimes called "Saarioinen", even though the two did not have the exact same territory. Some parts of Punkalaidun were also included in the Saarioinen division. Viiala, despite being subordinate to the Akaa parish, was not administratively a part of Saarioinen, but a part of Lempäälä instead.
The people of Saarioinen also had hunting grounds in what is now Central Finland. The first settlers of Jyväskylä and nearby Palokka came from Saarioinen.
Modern history.
Valkeakoski was separated from Sääksmäki in 1923, while Sääksmäki was consolidated with Valkeakoski in 1973.

Ogulsapar Muradova

Ogulsapar Muradova (Turkmen: Ogulsapar Muradowa; 1948 – 2006) was a Turkmen human rights activist and Radio Free Europe journalist.
She was the sister of Annadurdy Hajyýew, a leader of the exiled Republican Party of Turkmenistan. She was arrested on June 18, 2006 with two other activists - her brother Sapardurdy Khadzhiev, an associate of the Turkmen Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, and Annakurban Amanklychev. The state-controlled press accused them of smearing Turkmenistan's international reputation.
On June 19, President Saparmurat Niyazov personally issued a statement on national television condemning Muradova and other arrested activists. "I don't know why [the detainees] are engaged in such dirty business in Turkmenistan, a peaceful country where justice is ruling and where nobody is disgraced... Let people condemn the traitors. The entire population is proud of their motherland, whereas they are trying to harm it" Niyazov said.
On August 25, 2006, the three activists were sentenced to between six and seven years in jail on charges of illegal possession of weapons.
The trial reportedly lasted less than two hours and defence lawyers were reportedly not given the indictment before the trial commenced.
Muradova died in prison before September 14, 2006 of "natural causes", according to Turkmen officials, but her children are quoted as saying that her body had "marks on the neck" and a "large wound" on the head.
International human rights groups have expressed outrage over her death and called for an independent investigation into the circumstances that led to it.

Mary Adams (broadcaster)

Mary Grace Agnes Adams ("née" Campin OBE; 10 March 1898 – 15 May 1984) was an English television producer, programme director and administrator who worked for the BBC. She was instrumental in setting up the BBC's television service both before and after the Second World War. Her daughter says, "She was a socialist, a romantic and could charm with her charisma, spontaneity, and quick informed intelligence. She was a fervent atheist and advocate of humanism and common sense, accepting her stance without subjecting it to analysis." Mary Adams was the first female television producer for the BBC.
Biography.
Mary Adams was born on 10 March 1898 at Well House Farm, Hermitage, Berkshire. She gained a first-class honours degree in Botany from the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire (now Cardiff University). Subsequently Adams studied tissue culture at Cambridge University at the Strangeways Research Laboratory under Professor Strangeways. After her series "Six Talks on Heredity" was broadcast on BBC Radio, she left research and joined the BBC's Further Education Department in 1930.
Television career.
In 1936 she joined the fledgling television service at Alexandra Palace, London, and became the first female television producer. From January 1937 she was active in developing the service and producing television programmes (e.g. "Clothes-Line", the first television programme dedicated to fashion history, with James Laver and Pearl Binder). She was a working mother with a child, at a time when married women were expected to stay at home and not go out to work.
When the Second World War broke out in 1939, the BBC television service was closed for the duration of the war. She spent the war on BBC Radio and the Ministry of Information. She created the Home Intelligence division, and in 1940 set up a system for monitoring the public mood regarding the war effort. She wrote daily reports on British morale, which have been published.
When the television service resumed in 1946 she returned to working for it – producing programmes on all subjects apart from drama and light entertainment. She was appointed Head of Television Talks in 1954. She retired in 1958.
She encouraged David Attenborough to join BBC Television in 1952, appointed staff and commissioned ground-breaking programmes – such as "Zoo Quest"; "The Quiz Programme"; "Animal, Vegetable, Mineral"; "Your Life in Their Hands" and "A Matter of Life and Death" (early medical programmes), as well as programmes for children – "Muffin the Mule" (with Anne Hogarth, who pulled the strings), "Andy Pandy", and "Bill and Ben The Flowerpot Men" (with Freda Lingstrom and Maria Bird).
After retiring from BBC in 1958 she became a senior figure in the Consumers' Association, which produced the first comparative tests of consumer products, including contraceptives.
Marriage.
Mary Adams (née Campin) married in 1925 Samuel Vyvyan Adams (1900-1951), Conservative MP for Leeds West (1930-1945). He was an early anti-Nazi, and a radical reformer; he was one of only two Conservative MPs to oppose the Munich agreement with Hitler in 1938.

General State Laws for the Prussian States

The General State Laws for the Prussian States (, ALR) were an important code of Prussia, promulgated in 1792 and codified by Carl Gottlieb Svarez and Ernst Ferdinand Klein, under the orders of Frederick II. The code had over 17,000 articles, and covered fields of civil law, penal law, family law, public law, administrative law etc.
History.
Development.
Frederick I of Prussia wanted to create a uniform set of laws, but it was not started until the reign of Frederick II. Frederick's idea was not only to create a unified set of laws, but to make them clear and eliminate possible manipulations by different interpretation. A previous attempt, "Project eines Corporis Juris Fridericiani" (1749–51), by Samuel von Cocceji, proved unsuccessful.
The first version was called the "General Code for the Prussian states" (, AGB, 1792). Svarez and Klein, who were under the orders of Frederick the Great, presented a project in 1785, but the general state laws for the Prussian states were finally codified in 1794. Frederick had recently overruled his judiciary who had ruled against the millers Arnold in the Miller Arnold case, imprisoning judges who had disobeyed his orders. As a figure keen to maintain his prestige as an Enlightened Absolutist, codification of the laws was a desirable response to his un-Enlightened break of the 'rule of law'.
Usage.
The interpretations of the code's usage are contradictory; some interpret the laws as well known for being simple to read and interpret, without much abstract, being rather an every-day regulating laws, but others point out that while the code was written in German, it used an incredibly casuistic and imprecise language, making it hard to properly understand and use in practice.
After the second partition of Poland, it was promulgated on the annexed territories as subsidiary law, intended to accelerate the process of their integration with Prussia.
The Landrecht was a typical example of a law of the transition period between feudalism and capitalism, where old institutions of feudal law (ordinations, separate property, class divisions, nobility privileges, subjection of peasants) existed alongside modern ones (definition of property).
The Landrecht stopped functioning after the system was reformed (Stein–Hardenberg reforms) and the feudal remnants were removed.

He starred as The Emcee in a West End revival of "Cabaret" in 2022, earning a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical. He returned to Broadway in 2024, acting in a transfer of "Cabaret", which earned him a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical.
His first leading film role came with "Like Minds" (2006), and his breakthrough came with the roles of Colin Clark in the biopic "My Week with Marilyn" (2011) and Marius Pontmercy in the musical "Les Misérables" (2012). Redmayne won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the physicist Stephen Hawking in "The Theory of Everything" (2014). He was nominated in the same category for playing the transgender artist Lili Elbe in "The Danish Girl" (2015). From 2016 to 2022, he starred as Newt Scamander in the "Fantastic Beasts" film series. He has also portrayed Tom Hayden in "The Trial of the Chicago 7" (2020), Charles Cullen in "The Good Nurse" (2022), and the Jackal in the television series "The Day of the Jackal" (2024).
Early life and education.
Edward John David Redmayne was born on 6 January 1982 in Westminster, London. His mother, Patricia ("née" Burke), runs a relocation business, and his father, Richard Redmayne, is a businessman in corporate finance. His paternal great-grandfather was Sir Richard Redmayne (1865–1955), a civil and mining engineer, and a leading figure in improving mine safety in the early twentieth century. Sir Richard also led an enquiry into an experiment by the chain Boots to reduce the working week, allowing workers to have a 48-hour weekend, which found that the workers were happier, had better health, and were less likely to be absent, and advocated its adoption across wider industry. He has an elder brother, James Redmayne, a younger brother, and an elder half-brother, Charlie Redmayne, who is CEO of the UK division of publisher HarperCollins, and a half-sister.
From the age of 10, Redmayne attended Jackie Palmer Stage School, where he found his love for acting and singing. Redmayne attended Eaton House, followed by Colet Court (now St Paul's Juniors), on a choral scholarship, where he sang with the St Paul's Choir, then on a music scholarship to Eton College, where he was in the same year as Prince William. He received a choral scholarship to attend Cambridge, where he read History of Art at Trinity College, specialising in Venetian architecture and surrealism, and graduated with 2:1 Honours in 2003. He wrote his theses on Brâncuși and Yves Klein; although colour blind, he wrote the final thesis on International Klein Blue (IKB), which he has described as being highly emotional, and which he can always distinguish from others. While at Cambridge, Redmayne was a member of the University Pitt Club.
Acting career.
Stage.
Redmayne made his professional stage debut as Viola in "Twelfth Night", for Shakespeare's Globe at the Middle Temple Hall in 2002. He won the award for Outstanding Newcomer at the 50th "Evening Standard" Theatre Awards in 2004, for his performance in Edward Albee's "The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?", and the award for Best Newcomer at the Critics' Circle Theatre Awards in 2005. Reviewing a revival of the play in 2017, critic Heather Neill described the "gut-wrenching intensity of Eddie Redmayne's award-winning performance at the Almeida in 2004".
Redmayne starred in "Now or Later" by Christopher Shinn at the Royal Court Theatre. The show ran from 3 September to 1 November 2008. His performance received glowing reviews, with critic and playwright Nicholas de Jongh describing the performance as "riveting, suffused with the lineaments of neurosis and sadness".
In 2009, Redmayne appeared in John Logan's new play "Red" at the Donmar Warehouse in London, for which he won the 2010 Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Reviewing the show during this London run, longstanding "New York Times" critic Ben Brantley described Redmayne as "a star in the making". He reprised his role in "Red" at the John Golden Theatre on Broadway, in a 15-week run from 11 March to 27 June 2010, and won the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play.
He portrayed King Richard II in "Richard II" directed by Michael Grandage, at the Donmar Warehouse from 6 December 2011 to 4 February 2012. He received the Trewin Award for Best Shakespearean Performance at the Critics Circle Theatre Awards. Matt Wolf, London theatre critic for "The New York Times International Edition", described Redmayne as "tearing into the title role with an open-faced splendor that redefines the very discussion of soul that assumes such prominence in Shakespeare's luxuriantly beautiful text"
In November 2021, he returned to the stage as Emcee in a West End revival of "Cabaret" at the Playhouse Theatre, remodelled as the 'Kit Kat Club'. He previously played the role in a production at Eton when he was 17 years-old, and then again in a production at the Edinburgh Fringe. Redmayne successfully approached Jessie Buckley to star alongside him as Sally Bowles, as well as Rebecca Frecknall about directing the production. The revival drew rave reviews, with critic John Lahr stating that the 'scintillating show' also offered the 'rousing spectacle of the next generation's theatrical talent on the ascendant.' Lahr described Redmayne's interpretation of the Emcee as "thrilling", "a puckish portrait of violent innocence, a cross between Peter Lorre and Peter Pan", with a "chilling metamorphosis". John Nathan remarked, "Redmayne is a marvel. His Emcee — a slightly different species from the rest of the humans — is quite the most mercurial animal I have seen on stage". The revival led with seven wins at the 2022 Olivier Awards, including Best Musical Revival and Redmayne's own for Best Actor in a Musical, setting a record for being the most award-winning revival in Olivier history, as well for being the first production to obtain awards in all four eligible acting categories. In April 2024, the production transferred to the August Wilson Theatre on Broadway, where he reprised the role of the Emcee opposite Gayle Rankin as Sally Bowles. For his performance, Redmayne received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical at the 77th Tony Awards.
Screen.
Redmayne made his screen debut in 1998 in an episode of "Animal Ark". His television credits include the BBC miniseries "Tess of the d'Urbervilles", the miniseries "The Pillars of the Earth", and the two-part miniseries "Birdsong". David Chater, who served as a correspondent in many conflict-ridden areas, described his performance as a WWI soldier in Birdsong as "mesmerising", "astonishing", "so little is visible on the surface and yet a whole universe of emotions is simmering away behind those limpid eyes."
Redmayne was cast in his first feature film "Like Minds" (2006) after being spotted by casting director Lucy Bevan performing in a play called "Goats". Redmayne has appeared in films such as "The Good Shepherd" (2006), "Savage Grace" (2007), "Powder Blue" (2008), "The Other Boleyn Girl" (2008), "Glorious 39" (2009), and "Hick" (2011). He starred as Osmund in Christopher Smith's supernatural gothic chiller film "Black Death" (2010). His 2008 Sundance drama film "The Yellow Handkerchief" was released on 26 February 2010 by Samuel Goldwyn Films.
In 2011, Redmayne starred as filmmaker Colin Clark in the drama film "My Week with Marilyn". He took on the role of Marius Pontmercy for the 2012 musical film "Les Misérables".
In 2014, Redmayne starred as Stephen Hawking in "The Theory of Everything", a role for which he won the Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor, depicting the debilitating challenges of ALS. Hawking was very pleased by the portrayal, stating "I thought Eddie Redmayne portrayed me very well. At times I thought he was me. I think Eddie's commitment will have a big emotional impact." Dr Katie Sidle, a consultant neurologist specialising in the field of motor neurone disease (MND), stated in an interview in the British Medical Journal, "Eddie's performance in the film was utterly remarkable . . . The patients and carers loved the film. They thought it was very relevant to them."
In early 2015, Redmayne appeared in the Wachowski's film, "Jupiter Ascending" as Balem Abrasax. The film was widely panned, including his performance, and won him the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor.
In recent years, the film and the performance have been re-evaluated, with Keith Phipps writing that the "film has shown every sign of turning into a full-fledged cult hit." Writing in "Vanity Fair" in 2018, Laura Bradley remarked that "the idea that this film would have been improved by Redmayne playing his part in a more conventional (read: boring) manner is absurd." In 2022, Joe Hoeffner echoing her thoughts, felt that with a more "normal villain", "the rest of the film would be flatter, less colorful, less deliriously camp...no matter what happens you can't take your eyes off of the spacefaring Oedipus with the voice of a chainsmoker."
Redmayne also presented the 2015 documentary War Art with Eddie Redmayne, made as part of the ITV's Perspectives programme. In 2015, Redmayne guest starred as Ryan the Tank Engine in the "Thomas &amp; Friends" movie "Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure".
That same year, Redmayne starred in the biographical drama "The Danish Girl", directed by Academy Award-winning director Tom Hooper. In the film, released in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2016, Redmayne portrayed transgender pioneer Lili Elbe, a casting choice that was met with backlash from the transgender community. Nonetheless, Redmayne's performance garnered critical acclaim; in January 2016, he earned his second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor in consecutive years. Redmayne later acknowledged the controversy surrounding his casting by stressing the importance of casting transgender people to play transgender characters.
In 2016, Redmayne starred as Newt Scamander in the film adaptation of "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them", the first of a series within the Wizarding World of the "Harry Potter" film series, with a screenplay by J. K. Rowling. "Fantastic Beasts" was a critical and commercial success. In 2018, Redmayne starred in the stop-motion animated film "Early Man", and reprised his role as Newt Scamander in ' as well as its third sequel, "," which was released in April 2022 . Both ' and "" received mixed critical reception but emerged as financial successes. All of J. K. Rowling's "Fantastic Beasts" films rank among Redmayne's highest-grossing films to date.
In 2020, Redmayne starred as Tom Hayden in "The Trial of the Chicago 7". The film earned six nominations at the 93rd Academy Awards. Redmayne received a Screen Actors Guild Award as a member of the cast awarded the Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture honour.
In 2022, Redmayne starred in the biographical crime thriller film, "The Good Nurse", playing notorious serial killer Charles Cullen, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, a British Academy Film Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Leah Greenblatt at "Entertainment Weekly" wrote, "an eerie, pitch-perfect Redmayne, wearing Charlie's nice-guy drag like a battering ram, lets his mask slip so incrementally that the final scenes feel like a true terrifying rupture." Aurora Amidon at "Paste" remarked, "Redmayne plays Charles with such a sense of naturalism and magnetic intensity that it's easy to forget he's not in the room right there with you."
In 2024, he starred in and produced the television series "The Day of the Jackal", playing an elusive British assassin code-named the "Jackal". The performance was acclaimed, and he received nominations for a Screen Actor's Guild Award, a Critics Choice Award and a Golden Globe Award. Joel Golby, writing for the "Guardian" commended Redmayne for playing his "chameleonic and ice-cold" character, and for conveying a lot while having little dialogue; adding that "it's as if he's secretly uncovered a new way of acting". Verne Gay at "Newsday" remarked, "To the broadest of screen stereotypes - brutal assassin on the run - he adds layer upon layer, nuance upon nuance".
Public image.
Redmayne modelled for Burberry in 2008 with Alex Pettyfer, and in 2012 with Cara Delevingne. In 2016, he starred in the Prada Fall/Winter '16 Menswear Advertising Campaign.
Redmayne has been widely admired for his style, with "Vogue" describing him as having "seemingly preternatural panache on the red carpet, his deft ability to make even the nattiest and most colorful suits seem like second skin." In the September 2012 issue of "Vanity Fair", he was featured on its annual International Best Dressed List. In 2015, he was named number one in "British GQ"s 50 best dressed British men, and then again in 2016. Sir Elton John and David Furnish described him as "the stylish intersection where Cary Grant's style meets Fred Astaire's lithe elegance." "GQ" also named him as one of "the Most Stylish Men Alive" in 2015 and one of "the 13 Most Stylish Men In The World Right Now" in 2016.
Personal life.
Redmayne married Hannah Bagshawe on 15 December 2014. They have two children, a daughter and a son.
Redmayne was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2015 Birthday Honours for services to drama.
In August 2014, he was appointed ambassador of film education charity Into Film. He has been a patron of the Motor Neurone Disease Association since 2015, having become associated with the charity following his portrayal of Stephen Hawking. He is an ambassador of the Teenage Cancer Trust. He is a patron of Go Live Theatre Projects (earlier known as Mousetrap Theatre Projects), a charity dedicated to enriching the lives of children and young people through theatre, especially those who are disadvantaged or have additional needs.

Known for its reliable snowfall of 14 metres annually and challenging off-piste terrain, Super St-Bernard became a popular destination for freeriding enthusiasts, with one notable run extending across the border into Italy. Despite its reputation for excellent powder skiing, the remote location and extreme weather conditions—including frequent high winds exceeding 60 km/h—contributed to operational challenges and high maintenance costs.
The resort permanently closed in 2010 following financial difficulties and the inability to fund necessary infrastructure upgrades, becoming one of Switzerland's notable "ghost resorts" that continues to attract ski touring enthusiasts to its abandoned slopes.

Magnus von Wright was born at the village of Haminalahti in Kuopio, Finland. He was a Swedish-speaking Finn. His ancestors included Scottish merchants who had settled in Narva during the 17th-century. His father Henrik Magnus von Wright was a retired Major who owned the family estate, Haminalahden. He was the eldest in a family of nine surviving children. His brothers Wilhelm von Wright (1810–1887) and Ferdinand von Wright (1822-1906) also became artists.
He attended high school in Turku Gymnasium from 1823–25. It was there that he first developed his interest in birds and, although not a university student, was able to join the scientific society "Societas pro Fauna and Flora Fennica" organized by Carl Reinhold Sahlberg (1779-1860).
From 1823 to 1825, he attended the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm and studied privately with Carl Johan Fahlcrantz (1774-1861).
He was also permitted to study the ornithological collection at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
His first professional work came when he was asked to provide illustrations for "Otava eli suomalaisia huvituksia" (Stockholm: C. A. Gottlund.
1828), a three-volume compendium of Finnish culture and history, prepared and published by Carl Axel Gottlund (1779–1860).
After completing his work on "Otava", he was employed by Swedish ornithologist Nils Bonde. Assisted by his brother Wilhelm, he provided illustrations for the multi-volume "Svenska Fåglar" (Stockholm: C. von Scheele. 1828). He apparently was the first in Sweden to use the new lithographic technique for printing bird illustrations.
Upon his return to Finland, he worked as a cartographer for the land survey office. From 1845 to 1849, he was a taxidermist at the University of Helsinki's Zoological Museum, working with Evert Julius Bonsdorff, and taught drawing at the University from 1849 to 1868.
In 1857, he made a study trip to Düsseldorf, Kingdom of Prussia, where he created a series of still-lifes. Two years later, he published his own work on Finnish birds. He also spent many years helping to reconstruct the botanical and zoological collections that had been destroyed in the Great Fire of Turku. His paintings of Helsinki and its environs are considered to be of great historical value.
In 1846, he was elected to the board of directors of the Finnish Art Association and held this position until his death in 1868 at Helsinki.

The McDonald College

The McDonald College is an independent co-educational specialist primary and secondary day and boarding school with speciality in the creative and performing arts, in North Strathfield, an inner western suburb of Sydney, Australia.
Established in 1984, the school currently caters for approximately 300 students from Kindergarten to Year 12, including 45 boarders of all genders from Year 7 to Year 12. It is Australia's only Kindergarten to Year 12, independent school that provides specialist training in the performing arts on a daily basis.
The college is a member of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Australian Boarding Schools' Association (ABSA), and the Association of Independent Schools of New South Wales (AISNSW).
History.
While officially established in 1984, The McDonald College has a tradition and history dating back to the establishment of the Ann McDonald College of Dancing by Ann McDonald, a dance and singing teacher, in 1926.
On Ann McDonald's retirement her daughter, Margaret Markham, took over the Ann McDonald College of Dancing. In 1983 Markham saw the opportunity for establishing a specialist academic and performing arts school for gifted children, and subsequently, in partnership with Ann Fraser and Maxine Kohler, agreed to change the Ann McDonald College of Dancing from a private company into a community-based, not-for-profit company limited by guarantee, thus facilitating the establishment of The McDonald College Limited.
The McDonald College commenced in 1984 with 75 students in Strathfield. The school moved to its current campus, formerly the site of the Telstra Training School, in North Strathfield in 1999.
Campus.
Since 1999 the McDonald College has been located at North Strathfield, adjacent to North Strathfield Station. The school is close to the Olympic site and Bicentennial Park, and is 25 minutes from the Sydney central business district.
Facilities include air-conditioned classrooms, science and computer laboratories, art studios and exhibition space, nine dance studios, music studios and recital room, acting studios and performance spaces, television studio, recording studio, library, canteen, adjoining facilities and play equipment for junior students, and a boarding residence for up to 45 students of all genders.
Curriculum.
The McDonald College is registered and accredited by the New South Wales Education Standards Authority and therefore follows the mandated curriculum for all years. The school combines the academic curriculum together with an industry based performance program. These two areas of study complement each other, giving the students a broad, creative and engaging education.
Primary.
The academic program is designed to ensure students achieve age appropriate developmental and learning goals. Students also have access to specialist performing arts programs including drama, dance and music
Junior School (Kindergarten to Year 6) students participate in performing arts, together with the Key Learning Areas as set out by the NSW Education Standards Authority. A Gifted and Talented program is integrated at this stage to cater for students identified as 'academically gifted'.
Secondary.
The Stage 4 academic curriculum consists of the mandatory subjects English, History and Geography, all levels of Mathematics, Science, PDHPE and the Creative Arts. Specialist staff are used for subjects such as Design &amp; Technology, Visual Arts, Music and PDHPE (Personal Development, Health and Physical Education). 
In Stage 5, i.e. years 9 and 10, students begin accumulating grades for their Record of School Achievement (ROSA). Students continue with the mandatory subjects from Stage 4 and also choose 2 electives. The performing arts program is an extension to the mandated academic curriculum and typically supports much of the study in the elective courses and study a language other than English. Students participate in a performing arts program for two hours each day. Students experiencing learning difficulties are assisted through the Learning Enrichment Department.
In Stage 6 (Years 11 and 12) students have the opportunity to select all their subjects, except English which is compulsory. Some students choose to study a TVET course to complement their other subjects. Pathways is also an option for some students who want to complete their HSC in a longer timeframe (up to five years).
The senior students' programme is specifically geared towards helping them prepare for their futures beyond the Higher School Certificate.

Virginia State Route 37

State Route 37 (SR 37) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. Known as Winchester Bypass, it forms a western bypass of Winchester, connecting to Interstate 81 (I-81) at both ends. Although the road is a freeway, neither I-81 connection is freeway standard; the south end (exit 310) is a diamond interchange with two traffic signals, while, at the north end, drivers must use a short piece of U.S. Route 11 (US 11) to connect with I-81 at exit 317. In addition to local access, the highway connects to US 50 and US 522, two major highways that lead west and northwest into West Virginia and north to I-70 at Hancock, Maryland. An eastern bypass, known locally as "Route 37 East" has been proposed in statewide and local plans to complete the loop.
Route description.
Route 37 begins at an intersection with Hillandale Road (SR 847), a local frontage road along the east side of I-81, and Tasker Road (SR 642), which leads southeast to US 522 near Armel. It immediately crosses I-81 at exit 310, a diamond interchange with two traffic signals on SR 37, and then becomes a freeway, soon junctioning US 11 (Valley Pike) with a partial cloverleaf. The next interchange is a diamond at Cedar Creek Grade (SR 622), and SR 37 reaches its approximate midpoint at US 50 (Northwestern Pike), another diamond. A trumpet interchange completed in 2001 connects to the Winchester Medical Center, and the final diamond is with US 522 (Frederick Pike) at the northwestern corner. SR 37 ends at a partial Y interchange with US 11 (Martinsburg Pike), at which SR 37 traffic can only access US 11 north and only traffic from US 11 south can access SR 37, although a northbound exit to Cives Lane was added in about 2000 to allow SR 37 traffic to access US 11 south. About 1/2 mile (1 km) of US 11 is a divided highway, connecting SR 37 with I-81 at exit 317.
History.
Route 37 was defined as the proposed Winchester By-Pass by 1963, and was included in the statewide Arterial Network when it was created in 1964. When I-81 opened past Winchester in November 1965, it included an interchange south of Winchester, taking traffic between I-81 and US 11 along a short connecting road. The north half of the bypass, from US 50 west of Winchester north and east to US 11 north of the city, opened in the late 1960s, and the semicircle was completed in the late 1970s, with the linking of Route 37 to the existing I-81/US 11 connection. A new bridge carrying southbound SR 37 over I-81 was built, but otherwise the diamond interchange was not modified. The only change to the major bypass since it was constructed has been a new trumpet interchange serving the Winchester Medical Center; construction began in September 2000 and was completed in November 2001. A single ramp from SR 37 north to Cives Lane, allowing traffic at the north end of the bypass to access US 11 south, was built in about 2000.

<doc id="7028528" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7028528" title="Bihar Movement">
Bihar Movement

The Bihar movement, also known as the JP movement, was a political movement initiated by students in the Indian state of Bihar against misrule and corruption in the state government, in 1974. It was led by the veteran Gandhian socialist Jayaprakash Narayan, popularly known as JP. The movement later turned against Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government in the central government. It was also referred to as Sampoorna Kranti (Total Revolution Movement).
Early Protests.
When the Nav Nirman movement resulted in the forced resignation of the Gujarat government, student protests had already begun in Bihar. Unlike the Nav Nirman movement, political student outfits like Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) connected with the Jana Sangh, Samajwadi Yuvajan Sabha (SYS) connected with Samajwadi Party, and Lok Dal took an active role in the JP movement. All India Students' Federation (AISF) connected with the CPI was also involved.
Opposition parties called a statewide strike from 1973. This resulted in police firing on strikers in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, causing the deaths of eight students on 17 August 1973 owing to their participation in the JP Movement. The Raina Enquiry Commission also confirm that the action of the then Congress Government in Madhya Pradesh was in excess and the Government had not handled the situation properly.
On 18 February 1974, the Patna University Students Union organized a convention which invited student leaders from the whole state. They formed "Bihar Chhatra Sangharsh Samiti (BCSS)" to spearhead the agitation. Lalu Prasad Yadav was chosen as a president. Among the several contemporary youth leaders were Sushil Kumar Modi, Narendra Singh, Bashistha Narain Singh, Chandradeo Prasad Verma, Md Shahabuddin &amp; Ram Vilas Paswan. Their demands were related to education and food in hostels.
BCSS called for a "gherao" at Bihar Legislative Assembly during a budget session on 18 March 1974. They blocked all roads to the assembly and damaged government properties, including the telephone exchange and the residence of former education minister Ramanand Singh, which was set on fire.
Chief Minister Abdul Ghafoor convinced student leaders that he would look into demands. But students at colleges and universities kept protesting and damaging property. The killing of three students by police in Patna provoked student opposition across Bihar. BCSS declared a statewide strike on 23 March. Meanwhile, JP visited Gujarat to witness the Nav Nirman movement on 11 February and declared his intention to lead on 30 March 1974. BCSS approached JP to lead the agitation while he was withdrawing himself from the Bhoodan movement. He agreed.
On 1 April 1974, Indira Gandhi responded to the Bihar Movement's demands for the removal of the elected government. She asked, "How can such persons who continue to seek favours from the "moneyed" people ... dare to speak of corruption?" A silent student procession of 10,000 was held in Patna on 8 April. On 12 April, government opponents died in police firing at Gaya during the "Paralyse the Government" programme. Students also demanded dissolution of the Bihar Legislative Assembly. People demonstrated by blocking roads such as NH 31 and imposing a self-curfew. JP went to Delhi and attended a conference of Citizens for Democracy, an organization demanding civil rights, held on 13 and 14 April. During May 1974 various students' and peoples' organisations kept demanding dissolution of the assembly and also demanded the government's resignation, but did not succeed.
"Total Revolution".
On 5 June, he told people at a Patna rally to organize a protest at the Bihar Legislative Assembly, which resulted in the arrest of 1,600 agitators and 65 student leaders by 1 July 1974. He advocated a program of social transformation by participation of youth in social activities. He called it Total Revolution (Sampurna Kranti) Movement. Protests and closure of colleges and universities also occurred on 15 July. Some colleges started after that and examinations were held. JP told students to boycott examinations but many students appeared in examinations. He called for a three-day statewide strike starting from 3 October and addressed a massive public gathering on 6 October.
Demanding the resignation of MLAs started on 4 November, much as the Nav Nirman movement had done, but 42 out of 318 MLAs had resigned before that, including 33 from opposition parties. Many MLAs refused to resign. Government tried hard to stop people from reaching Patna for the movement and also lathi charged people.
On 18 November, at a massive gathering at Patna, he spoke to the Congress government of Indira Gandhi. He realised the importance of fighting within the democratic system rather than a party-less democracy so he contacted opposition parties, which finally resulted in the formation of the Janata Party.
End and aftermath.
The Bihar Movement turned into a "Satyagraha" and volunteers kept protesting at the Bihar Legislative Assembly, inviting arrest starting on 4 December. Indira Gandhi did not change the Chief Minister of Bihar, Abdul Ghafoor, because she did not want to give in to protestors' calls for the dissolution of the assembly as she did in Gujarat.
JP kept travelling all across India, strengthening and uniting opposition parties to defeat Congress. The election in Gujarat was delayed until Morarji Desai went on a hunger strike demanding it be held. The election was held on 10 June and the result was declared on 12 June 1975, with Congress losing. The same day(12 June 1975), the Allahabad High Court declared Indira Gandhi's election to the Lok Sabha in 1971 void on grounds of electoral malpractice. The court thus ordered her to be removed from her seat in Parliament and banned from running in elections for six years. It effectively removed her from the Prime Minister's office. She rejected calls to resign and went to the Supreme Court. She recommended President V. V. Giri to appoint A. N. Ray as a Chief Justice to get a favourable outcome in the case. JP opposed such a movement in his letters to Indira Gandhi and called for her to resign.
She imposed a nationwide Emergency to safeguard her position on the night of 25 June 1975. Immediately after proclamation of emergency, prominent opposition political leaders Jayaprakash Narayan &amp; Satyendra Narayan Sinha were arrested without any prior notice, so were dissenting members of her own party. JP was held in custody at Chandigarh even after he had asked for a month's parole for mobilising relief in areas of Bihar gravely affected by flooding. His health suddenly deteriorated on 24 October, and he was released on 12 November; diagnosis at Jaslok Hospital, Bombay, revealed kidney failure; he would be on dialysis for the rest of his life.
After Indira Gandhi revoked the Emergency on 21 March 1977 and announced elections, it was under JP's guidance that the Janata Party (a vehicle for the broad spectrum of the anti-Indira Gandhi opposition) was formed. Considered to be an election of newcomers, a huge crowd of youth activists and leaders used to gather before the residence of the Bihar Janta party president Satyendra Narayan Sinha. The Janata Party was voted into power, and became the first non-Congress party to form a government at the Centre in India. In Bihar, after the Janata Party came to power, Karpuri Thakur won the chief ministership battle from the then Bihar Janata Party President Satyendra Narayan Sinha to become the Bihar Chief Minister in 1977.
Commemoration.
On 17 February 2002, Sampoorna Kranti Express, named in recognition of the Bihar Movement, started its service between Rajendra Nagar Terminal in Patna and New Delhi. It is one of the fastest train services in India, traversing a distance of 1001 kilometres in under 14 hours.

Integration law for immigrants to the Netherlands

The integration law for immigrants to the Netherlands, known as the Civil Integration Act 2021 (), is a law designed to ensure that long-term immigrants to the Netherlands, who are not citizens of the European Union, European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) or Switzerland, integrate into Dutch society. This law requires immigrants to follow a structured process of integration including social integration, which includes learning the Dutch language, understanding Dutch society, and participating in civic life. Immigrants must complete this process, including passing an exam, within three years of their arrival in the Netherlands.
Since its introduction in 2006, the law has undergone several revisions. The most significant reforms, implemented in 2022, have been met with controversy for several reasons, ranging from concerns about the process's complexity and fairness to issues about how it affects different immigrant groups.
According to a separate law, known as the , certain classes of prospective immigrants must also pass a test involving basic knowledge of Dutch and Dutch society even before they first enter the Netherlands.
Introduction.
Specific programs devoted to integration did exist before 2007. Between 1998 and 2007, new immigrants were obligated to follow an integration course that contained implemented standards on a national level. The courses were financed by the government and organized by local municipalities. There was, however, no compulsory test. Immigrants were fined only if they did not take the course without a valid reason.
The Law on Integration, drafted by Rita Verdonk, was passed by the House of Representatives (Tweede Kamer) on July 7, 2006, only one member of the House of Representatives, Fatma Koşer Kaya (D66), voted against it. It then passed the Senate (Eerste Kamer) on November 28, 2006 where four smaller political parties opposed it, totaling 13 out of 75 Senators. The law took effect on January 1, 2007. It provided legal framework for current programme, which is known as "inburgering".
"Inburgering" is a requirement for residents who have relocated to the Netherlands from countries outside of the European Union, in addition to others in certain circumstances. After a period of three-and-a-half years (five years for some), they must pass an exam that evaluates various aspects of their integration. The current exam consists of six parts. Four measure Dutch language skills and include components that test an immigrants' speaking, listening, writing and reading abilities. The fifth tests their knowledge of Dutch society. The sixth portion, introduced in 2015, assesses their understanding of the Dutch labor market.
The obligation to take the test currently applies not only to new immigrants, but also to some who have lived in the Netherlands for five years or longer.
Prior to traveling to the Netherlands.
A similar obligation exists for some foreigners wishing to relocate to the Netherlands, especially people wanting to marry a resident or a citizen. These rules can be found in another law titled the "Wet inburgering in het buitenland" (“Integration law for Immigrants to the Netherlands Abroad”). The exam is requirement to receive a temporary long stay residence permit (Dutch: MVV) and is usually taken at a Dutch embassy.
Failure to meet the obligations.
Since the obligation was introduced for people entering after January 1, 2007, the law had no consequences for people failing to fulfill their obligations until July 1, 2010.
Local city councils are responsible for making sure that those obliged to take the exam do so. Failure to pass the test within the allotted time can result in financial penalties. The specifics depend on the resident's place of residence and can total anywhere from several hundred to more than 1,000 euros. However, residents can request additional time to prepare for the exam if their reasons for not adhering to their obligation is deemed sufficient. Contrary to popular belief, a resident cannot be denied residency because they have not passed the exam.
Exceptions.
The law does not apply to:
In 2010, a Dutch judge ruled that the law ought not to be extended to Turkish citizens, because of an association treaty between the European Union and Turkey.
Implementation and cost.
The civic integration exam costs €250. The cost to learn the Dutch language can vary by the school, and how much Dutch the pupil already knows. The total amount DUO is willing to loan an asylum seeker to complete their studies is in excess of €10,000.
Controversy.
A major aspect of the controversy relates to the language proficiency requirement. The 2022 reforms introduced a higher language threshold for immigrants seeking permanent residency or citizenship. The required proficiency level was increased from CEFR A2 to B1, which is considered more challenging. While the A2 level is still accepted for certain pathways, the B1 level, is necessary for permanent residency. This change has been criticized as an obstacle to integration, as achieving B1-level proficiency within the three-year integration period may be difficult for certain groups. 
Additionally, the financial burden placed on immigrants has raised concerns. Under the law, asylum seekers receive municipal support for integration courses and exams, but other groups, such as family migrants, are required to finance their own integration. This situation disproportionately affects lower-income individuals and has been viewed as a barrier to successful integration. The potential for penalties if the integration process is not completed within the required timeframe adds further stress, with fines and, in some cases, the denial of residency status posing risks to immigrants who struggle to meet the requirements.
The reforms also altered the support system for immigrants. While municipalities are responsible for overseeing the integration process, the extent of support varies depending on the category of the immigrant. Asylum seekers receive comprehensive assistance, but others, such as family members of skilled workers, are often left to navigate the integration system independently. This has led to criticisms of inequity in the distribution of resources and support.

Virginia State Route 39

State Route 39 (SR 39) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs from the West Virginia state line near Mountain Grove, where the highway continues as West Virginia Route 39 (WV 39), east to U.S. Route 11 (US 11) in East Lexington. SR 39 connects Lexington with several communities formed around hot springs in Bath County. In Rockbridge County, the state highway passes through the town of Goshen and Goshen Pass, a gorge formed by the Maury River.
All of SR 39 is a Virginia Byway.
Route description.
SR 39 begins at Ryder Gap at the West Virginia state line, which also serves as the boundary between George Washington National Forest and Monongahela National Forest and between the James River and Monongahela River watersheds. The roadway continues west of the state line as WV 39 toward Minnehaha Springs and Marlinton. SR 39, which is named Mountain Valley Road, passes through a hairpin turn on its descent of the dividing ridge, then follows Big Turn Run to the valley of Little Back Creek, which passes by the hamlet of Mooretown. At Mountain Grove, the state highway turns south to follow Back Creek through a gap in Back Creek Mountain. SR 39 ascends the east side of the mountain along O'Rourke Draft, then descends to the Jackson River. The state highway continues east along Warm Springs Run through a gap in Little Mountain to the village of Warm Springs. SR 39 has a short concurrency with US 220 (Ingalls Boulevard) north of the village in which the highways pass the Jefferson Pools.
SR 39 ascends Warm Springs Mountain and passes around the edge of Big Piney Mountain, then follows Jordan Creek and Thompson Creek past Bath Alum, the site of an airport, and McClung. The state highway follows the Cowpasture River to Millboro Springs, where the highway begins to run concurrently with SR 42 (Cow Pasture River Road). SR 39 and SR 42 leave the Cowpasture River and enter the valley of Mill Creek, which the highways and a CSX rail line follow through the gap in Mill Mountain at which they enter Rockbridge County and the town of Goshen and continue as Maury River Road. Just north of the center of town, SR 39 Alternate splits to the south as Main Street. SR 42 (Virginia Avenue) splits to the north immediately before SR 39 passes under another rail line and crosses Mill Creek just above its confluence with the Calfpasture River. SR 39 meets the first rail line at grade immediately before receiving the eastern end of SR 39 Alternate (Main Street).
South of Goshen, SR 39 leaves the rail line after an at-grade crossing and follows the Calfpasture River through a gap between Bratton Mountain and Knob Mountain and passes to the south of Lake Merriweather, an impoundment of the Little Calfpasture River. The two Calfpasture rivers merge to form the Maury River. SR 39 passes through Goshen Pass, a gorge formed by the Maury River through Great North Mountain that is preserved in the Goshen Pass Natural Area Preserve. East of the gorge, the state highway crosses to the north side of the river and passes through Rockbridge Baths. SR 39 leaves the immediate vicinity of the river and meets the southern end of SR 252 (Brownsburg Turnpike) at Cedar Grove. The state highway veers south along a curvaceous path toward East Lexington. SR 39 briefly parallels Interstate 64 (I-64) before reaching its eastern terminus at US 11 (Lee Highway). US 11 has an interchange with I-64 immediately to the south, which also leads to I-81 a short distance to the east.
SR 39 Alternate.
SR 39 Alternate (SR 39 Alt.) is a alternate route serving as a shortcut for through traffic on SR 39 in the town of Goshen. The route serves as a truck route for SR 39 as bridge with a low clearance on the main route. The name of the road throughout the entire route is Main Street. SR 39 Alt. begins at the intersection of Main Street and Virginia Avenue (SR 39 and SR 42) and heads south. Immediately, it crosses over the Mill Creek and has a grade crossing with a railroad. After the railroad crossing, Main Street sharply curves to the east to parallel the railroad. The route ends shortly thereafter at a T-intersection with Maury River Road (SR 39).

Mukasura

Mukasura () is an asura featured in the Indian epic Mahabharata. 
Legend.
In the Kairata Parva of the Mahabharata, Arjuna ascends the Indrakila mountain to perform a penance to please Shiva, for obtaining the deity's personal weapon, called the pashupatastra. He is attacked by a danava named Muka, who had assumed the form of a boar. Arjuna proclaims that he means no harm to the beast, but would slay it in self-defence. Shiva, disguised as a "kirata" (hunter), shouts at the prince to stop, stating that he had aimed at the creature first. Both of their arrows strike Mukasura at the same moment, killing him. Arjuna angrily accuses the hunter of breaking the law of the hunt and attacks him. The two exchange arrows, and Arjuna finds that he is no match for his opponent. To propitiate Shiva, Arjuna creates an earthen lingam and decorates it with a garland. He is moved by joy when the garland appears around the hunter's head, realising his true identity. Shiva appreciates the valour of Arjuna and grants him the boon of the missile.

Nikolai Astrup

Nikolai Astrup () (30 August 1880 – 21 January 1928) was a Norwegian modernist painter. Astrup was a distinctive, innovative artist noted principally for his intense use of color depicting the lush landscapes of Vestlandet featuring the traditional way of life in the region.
Biography.
Nikolai Johannes Astrup was born in the village of Kalvåg on the island of Frøya in Norway. Astrup grew up in Ålhus in rural Jølster between the Sognefjord and the Nordfjord. He was the eldest son of eleven children born to Christian Astrup (1844–1919) who was a parish priest at Ålhus Church in Jølster. Astrup was the great-grandson of Nils Astrup (1778–1835), a member of the Norwegian Parliament. Astrup's father wanted him to become a priest and sent him to Trondheim Cathedral School from 1895 to 1897. However, Astrup failed his Latin exams as he was more interested in drawing and painting. In 1899, Astrup left for Kristiania (now Oslo) where he matriculated as student at the Royal Academy of Design. Astrup quickly left to join Harriet Backer's painting school where he studied until 1901. Astrup lived in Paris where he studied at the Académie Julian and was a student of Christian Krohg at Académie Colarossi from 1901 to 1902. Astrup later traveled to Berlin, Dresden, Munich, and Hamburg. By 1902, he had returned to and settled in Jølster. In 1911, Astrup studied under Lovis Corinth in Berlin at Arthur Lewin-Funcke's school of Painting.
Astrup held three significant exhibitions during his lifetime; at Kristiania 1905 and 1911 and at Bergen in 1908. In 1907, he was married to Engel Sunde with whom he had eight children. Astrup struggled with tuberculosis and general poor health as his asthma worsened. In 1913, Astrup settled with his wife and children in Sandalstrand (now Astruptunet) on the south side of Lake Jølstravatn across from the village of Ålhus. He died of pneumonia in 1928 at the age of 47 in the neighboring municipality of Førde. Astrup was buried in Ålhus Cemetery, in Jølster Norway.
Artistry.
Astrup preferred clear, strong colors and usually made landscape art depicting his surroundings in Jølster. Having spent the majority of his life in Jølster, the landscape proved a strong influence and through his paintings he sought 'a national "visual language" that evoked the traditions and folklore of his homeland'.
His paintings describe an intimate interaction between nature and the developed environment, characterized by bold lines and distinctive rich color. Astrup is regarded as a neo-romantic painter, but he also worked with woodcuts. Astrup is looked upon as one of the greatest Norwegian artists of the early 1900s, and several of his paintings have been sold at auctions for approximately US$500,000. Astrup's works have been likened to those of his contemporary Edvard Munch, though Astrup's style has been described as being 'so much brighter – not just in colour, but also in mood'.
The first exhibition of Astrup's work outside of Norway took place in London at Dulwich Picture Gallery, from 5 February - 15 May 2016. The exhibition displayed over 90 oil paintings and prints, including works from private collections never publicly exhibited. In 2021 Astrup's work was the subject of the large survey exhibition "Nikolai Astrup: Visions of Norway" at the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts in the United States.
Legacy.
KODE, Bergen's largest museum for paintings, has devoted one wing entirely to Astrup's life and work.
In 2018, Mount Eerie released a song titled "Two Paintings by Nikolai Astrup" from their album "Now Only".

Job of Pochayev

Job of Pochayev (; c. 1551 – 28 October 1651), to the world Ivan Zalizo (), in Great Schema John () was an Eastern Orthodox monk and saint.
Childhood and early years.
Job was born around 1551 near the city of Kolomyia, Galicia, when it was within the Polish kingdom.
His pious parents John and Agapia of the Zalizo (lit. "Iron") family, named him Ivan (John) after John the Baptist. The lives of Rastko Nemanjić, John of Damascus and "The Ladder" by John Climacus were the models of virtuous life for the young Ivan. According to his biographer and disciple Dositheus, while he was young in years he was perfect in wisdom, and the boy differed from other children by his high spiritual aspirations, with never a contradiction in his words, knowledge and actions.
Joining Uhornytskyi monastery.
At the age of 10 he secretly left home for the Transfiguration Ugorniki Monastery, and asked the hegumen (abbot) to accept him to serve the brothers. When Ivan turned 12, he was tonsured as a monk and was given the name Job. Since then, he began to follow the example of the biblical character Job as a model of living. Reaching the age of 31 he was offered priestly ordination, which he accepted.
Transfer to Dubno monastery and literary work.
After the repeated offers of a local, Konstantin Ostrozhsky, the defender of Orthodoxy, he was transferred to the island monastery of the Exaltation of the Cross outside of Dubno that belonged to the duke's estates in the Rivne region. The monastery was arranged after the canons of Theodore the Studite. There, for 20 years, Job served as hegumen (abbot) and engaged himself in the writing of theological books. 
The collection of his works, "The Book of the Venerable Job of Pochayiv, Written by His Own Hand", contained 80 teachings, conversations, and sermons of St. Job, as well as excerpts he himself compiled from the writings of the Holy Fathers. It was translated into Russian and republished in 1881 under the title "Pchela Pochayevskaya" ("The Bee of Pochayiv"), edited by the professor of the Kiev Theological Academy, N. Petrov.
In his writings, Job defended Orthodoxy against the Protestant heresies (especially the Socinianists) that were spreading in western Malorossiya during his time, writing on the most important Orthodox dogmas of the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, about the Mother of God, baptism and everything that was rejected by Protestant missionaries.
Job also critiqued Roman Catholic teachings regarding the use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist, among other doctrinal differences in the face of Roman Catholic persecution of Orthodoxy following the Union of Brest (1596). Many Orthodox Christians living in Poland at the time were deprived of their rights, and attempts were made to force them to convert to Catholicism. A number of Orthodox bishops even became apostates to Uniatism. To counteract this problem, Job and others defended Orthodoxy by copying and disseminating Orthodox books. Prince Ostrozhsky was also responsible for the Ostrog Bible (1581), the first printed edition of the Bible in Church Slavonic.
Hermit withdrawal to Pochayev.
On account of his growing fame, he decided to withdraw as a hermit into the mountain caves monastery at Pochayev in Kremenets district. Having joined the monastery in 1604, Job was eventually elected hegumen.
Job was quiet, brief in words, and the only sound heard from his lips was the Jesus prayer. For many days and weeks he would retreat into his locked cave, so narrow that entry is difficult, and so small that it was impossible to sit, stand or lie conveniently. From the long periods of kneeling, his knees were covered with wounds, and wearing knee-marks into the rock floor. His disciple Dosyfey recounts that he saw supernatural light coming from the depths of the cave, shining for two hours onto the opposite side of the church. Dosyfey records that at the sight he was terrified and fell to the ground.
Job introduced strict discipline and other reforms of monastic life. During his time in office, the monastery had to fend off incessant attacks by Andrzej Firlej, Castellan of Belz, who sued the monks over his grandmother's bequest of extensive lands and a miracle-working icon of the Mother of God. In 1623, Firlej raided the monastery, taking the holy icon with him and keeping it until 1641, when a court decision finally restituted the icon to the monks.
In 1628 Job attended the Synod of Kiev, called to defend the Orthodox Church against Uniatism.
Sometime after 1642, he was tonsured into the Great Schema, and received the new monastic name of John.
Death and canonization.
Job died on 25 October 1651 and was glorified as a saint shortly thereafter. After his death, Job appeared three times in a vision to Dionysius Balaban, the Metropolitan of Kiev, and instructed him that God wanted the Metropolitan to uncover the saint's relics.
After the first two visions, Metropolitan Dionysius did not follow the order. Only after the third, when Job threatened him with misfortune should he continue to disobey, did Dionysius see in it God’s will. The same day, the Metropolitan departed for Pochayev and gave orders to open the grave of Job immediately.
This took place on 28 August 1659. His body was found to be incorrupt, emitting a wonderful and heavenly fragrance. The relics were taken to the Trinity Cathedral of the Lavra for veneration.
A second "Uncovering of the Relics" of Job of Pochayev took place on 28 August 1833, at which his relics were solemnly transferred to a church consecrated to his honour which had been built at the Pochayev Lavra.
Every year, on 28 August a great number of Orthodox pilgrims come to Pochayev Lavra to honour Saint Job, venerate his relics, and ask for his intercession.
Healings and miracles.
During the Zbarazh War of 1675, the cloister was besieged by the Turks, who reputedly fled upon seeing the apparition of the Theotokos (Mother of God) accompanied by angels and Job. Numerous Turkish Muslims who witnessed the event during the siege converted to Christianity afterward. One of the monastery chapels commemorates this event.
In 1759, a coach of Count Mikołaj Bazyli Potocki capsized near the monastery walls. In a fit of anger, Potocki fired at his driver three times, all without avail. Attributing this failure to divine intervention, Potocki settled in Pochayiv and started to lavish gifts upon the cloister.
In 1773, Potocki (who was a Roman Catholic) petitioned the Pope to recognize the Pochayev icon as miraculous and Job as a Catholic saint. Only the former petition was satisfied.
On 28 October 1908 when the Bishop of Volhynia and the faithful celebrated the feast day of Saint Job, Job repeatedly appeared in a vision in front of the bishop and blessed the Holy Mysteries (Body and Blood of Christ).
The cave church of St Job contains a famous gift from Countess Orlova - a silver reliquary with relics of the saint.
The Printshop of St. Job of Pochaev at Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, New York, is dedicated to Job, and is the principal press of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, publishing liturgical and spiritual works in Church Slavonic, Russian and English.
Feast Days.
The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates his memory on October 28, the day of his repose (for those churches which follow the Julian Calendar October 28 falls on November 10 of the Gregorian Calendar, a difference of 13 days).
On August 28/September 10 the church celebrates the anniversary of the Uncovering of his Relics. In 1902, the Holy Synod decreed that on this day the holy relics of St Job be carried in procession around the Dormition Cathedral of the Pochaev Lavra after the Divine Liturgy.
and October 10/23 (as one of the seven saints commemorated on the Synaxis of the Saints of Volhynia).

Virginia State Route 41

State Route 41 (SR 41) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. Known as Franklin Turnpike, the state highway runs from SR 360 northeast of Danville to SR 57 in Callands. The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) officially designates the route north of U.S. Route 29 Business (US 29 Bus.) in Danville as a part of SR 41 but the Franklin Turnpike south and east of this point is signed as SR 41.
Route description.
SR 41 begins at a stop-controlled T-intersection with SR 360 (Old Richmond Road) in an unincorporated area of Pittsylvania County. The route starts as a four-lane divided highway and within of its southern terminus, it has an interchange with the US 29 freeway. After the interchange, SR 41 crosses over Falls Creek and a railroad on a , curved bridge. While traveling over the bridge, the route enters the city limits of Danville. The route has only a few driveways and one road intersection before its intersection with SR 293 (Main Street). The highway then heads northwest through a more residential neighborhood and intersects US 29 Bus. (Piney Forest Road) before leaving the independent city and reentering Pittsylvania County. SR 41 passes through the unincorporated communities of Mount Hermon and Pleasant Gap, where the highway crosses White Oak Mountain. The state highway curves west then veers north at Swansonville. SR 41 reaches its northern terminus at SR 57 (Callands Road) in Callands. The state highway follows the height of land north of the watershed of the Sandy River, which empties into the Dan River in Danville. To the north of SR 41 are the watersheds of Little Falls Creek east of White Oak Mountain and the Bannister River west of the mountain; these streams empty into the Dan River at Danville and near South Boston, respectively.
History.
Prior to 1949, the route continued north past VA 57 down what is now SR 969 Sago Road/Danville Turnpike into Franklin County, where it met up with what is now SR 890 Snow Creek Road, then VA 108. This might explain why VA 40 east of Rocky Mount in Franklin County is named "Old Franklin Turnpike" while VA 41 is named Franklin Turnpike.
The route was truncated to its present northern terminus at SR 57 in 1949 due to low traffic counts. In August 1962, the Commonwealth Transportation Board (CTB) approved a motion to drop the segment of SR 41 between North Main Street (US 29) and Piney Forest Road (what was then Alt. US 29) at the same time major highways were constructed throughout downtown Danville. Despite this truncation, the route continued to be signed to North Main Street.
In 2001, the Franklin Turnpike Extension was approved by the CTB to be constructed. Initially, the new road was designated SR 265. The portion of the extension from the US 29 interchange to SR 360 had already been completed when construction on the remainder of the extension began. The project (later renamed to East Franklin Turnpike and renumbered to be a part of SR 41) was completed in late 2011 at a cost of .

NRA Gun Club

NRA Gun Club ("Gun Club in Italy") is described as a nonviolent first-person target shooting game by Crave Entertainment in North America and 505 Games only in Italy. Although not released in the UK, a few PAL UK units have been found in circulation in some 505 European markets (A German release was planned, but cancelled for unknown reasons). The game allows gamers to enter the shooting range and shoot at paper targets, watermelons and sporting clays. The game contains over 100 licensed and recreated firearms. It was endorsed by the National Rifle Association of America, bearing their logo on the cover art.
Background.
"Gun Club" was one of a number of target shooting games backed by the NRA in response to the perception that violent first-person shooters were responsible for violent crime including school shootings. In 2012, NRA President Wayne LaPierre lambasted video games in a press conference following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting stating "Another little dirty secret the media tries to conceal is a callous corrupt and disgusting shadow industry ... vicious violent video games,"
Weeks later, the NRA released "NRA: Practice Range" - a mobile game for Apple iOS devices.
At the time of release, the NRA commented on "Gun Club" that "In keeping with the NRA mission, this game tests marksmanship in a sporting environment and emphasizes responsible use of firearms,".
Alongside Gun Club on PS2, "NRA High Power Competition" was released for Windows PCs in 2006.
Reception.
The game received very poor ratings and reviews. It was rated by GameSpot 1.6 out of 10 (abysmal) as one of the worst games ever made for the PlayStation 2. Another gaming site, IGN, gave the game a 1.5 out of 10 ("abysmal") and called the game, "a bold move in exploring new depths of sheer worthlessness." The game was rated E10+ (for everyone 10 years of age or older) for mild violence by the Entertainment Software Rating Board.
Particular criticism was directed at the poor quality of graphics and the generic audio, with sounds used across "over 100 licensed and faithfully recreated firearms.". Reviewers noted that in a firearm-oriented game, failure to differentiate guns in gameplay rendered much of the progression pointless.

Kanzan Shimomura

 was the pseudonym of a nihonga painter in Meiji through to the early Shōwa period Japan. His real name was Shimomura Seizaburō.
Biography.
Kanzan was born in 1873 in Wakayama city, Wakayama Prefecture into a family of hereditary Noh actors.
Having moved to Tokyo at the age of eight, Kanzan studied under Kanō Hōgai, and after Hōgai's death, under Hashimoto Gahō. He graduated first in his class at the "Tōkyō Bijutsu Gakkō" (the forerunner of the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music), and became a teacher at the same institution in 1894.
When Okakura Tenshin left government service to establish the Japan Fine Arts Academy ("Nihon Bijutsuin"), Kanzan joined him, together with Yokoyama Taikan and Hishida Shunsō. However, Kanzan returned to his teaching post at the Tokyo Bijutsu Gakkō from 1901–1908, with a hiatus from 1903–1905, when he went to study in England.
From 1914, he helped reestablish the Japan Fine Arts Academy, and in 1917 was appointed a court painter to the Imperial Household Agency. He served as a judge for both the "Bunten" and the "Inten" Exhibitions.
In terms of style, Kanzan was influenced by the "Rinpa" and the "Kanō" schools, as well as early Buddhist paintings and Tosa school "Emakimono." To these elements, he combined the realism developed from his exposure to western art works during his stay in England.
One of his representative works is a "byōbu" titled "Yoroboshi" or "The Beggar Monk" was created in 1915 in colored ink and gold leaf on paper. It is currently housed in the Tokyo National Museum, and is registered as an Important Cultural Property by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. The screen depicts a scene from a famous Noh play of the same name. In the scene, blind monk, has been falsely accused of a crime. Disowned by his family he wanders about, living as a vagrant. Although he is now blind, he has become one with the universe and can see all that surrounds him. Kanzan borrowed heavily from Momoyama period and Edo period style and composition, and the work shows a strong "Rimpa" influence.

McLean began his senior career with Leyton Orient in 1999, having graduated from the club's youth ranks. Never really breaking into the first team, he made 40 league appearances in a four-year spell, which also included a brief loan to Grays Athletic. He switched to Aldershot Town in 2003, and, after making 68 league appearances, moved again to Grays Athletic in 2005. He quickly became a regular player for Grays, making 59 league appearances before switching to Peterborough United in 2006; initially on loan, which became permanent the following year. He was a regular for Peterborough, and made 148 league appearances before moving to Hull City in January 2011. Initially a regular player for Hull, he fell out of favour following the club's promotion to the Premier League, and moved on loan to Ipswich Town and then Birmingham City in 2013. In January 2014 McLean completed a move to Bradford City.

On 7 December 2011 against Birmingham City at the KC Stadium, a Birmingham attack was broken up and Corry Evans played the ball to Robert Koren in the centre circle.

T-Spoon

T-Spoon is a Dutch Eurodance project founded in 1991 by rapper Shalamon Baskin (aka Shamrock) and co-founder Remy de Groot (aka Prince Peration). The project was offered a recording contract by No More Music.
Musical career.
The debut T-Spoon single "No Time 2 Waste" was released in 1993, which reached the top 10 in Europe (the single "Spank", released in 1991 under the same project name, is probably from a different project).
During the following years, T-Spoon scored a string of hits, which brought them success in countries like the UK, Australia, Canada, Israel, Ireland, Scandinavia, South America and their home country, the Netherlands with songs like "A Part of My Life", "Where R U Now", "Take Me 2 the Limit" and "Sex on the Beach". They released four full album CDs, including a remix CD and a hit single collection. Their music is mainly Eurodance, including tracks of the R&amp;B, happy hardcore and Euro reggae genres.
Behind T-Spoon stands Prince Peration (Dutch Remy de Groot), the group's founder and one of its driving forces. The co-producers were Dominic Sas and Serge Ramaekers (known for their projects Confetti's and Cartouche). On stage, T-Spoon consisted of four members: a female vocalist (Ingrid Simons, Jean Shy, Blonde, then Linda Estelle) and a male rapper (Shamrock, replaced in 1998 by Greg Dillard, then in 2001 by King Lover), and the two dancers, Regilio and Anatevka Bos.
In 1994, American jazz/blues vocalist Jean Shy was the featured singer for the Dutch formation.
In 1996, singer Linda Estelle joined the group, which changed the band's direction into the then-popular happy hardcore genre. In 1997, they became known for the summer hit "Sex on the Beach" which made the charts in the Netherlands as well as Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom. The song was first released in Ireland following its success in Europe. There it became one of the biggest hits of the year, peaking at number 3 in the Irish charts. Such was the success in Ireland that the song was released in the United Kingdom at the end of the summer and reached number 2 in the UK charts.
In 1998, Shamrock left the group and was replaced by Greg Dillard. With Dillard as the band's new rapper, the group had a 1999 hit with "Summerlove". In 2000, Dillard left, and Estelle became the new face of the group. In 2002, Shamrock rejoined T-Spoon, and the group subsequently released a number of remixes that were not very successful.
In 2008, Shamrock and Linda Estelle toured with their 'T-Spoon Reloaded Show'. In March, they performed at Ekonomika Rewind Leuven (Belgium). In December, it was announced that Linda Estelle and Shamrock were back in the studio, and that they would record some new songs together to be released the following year.
In February 2009, they announced that they were busy recording and remixing some of their old hits, and that they had started writing new songs and were looking for collaborations throughout the world. In June, they appeared at Q Music's Foute Party in Den Bosch. Then they took part in a commercial for Johma salads' 40th anniversary, with Shamrock doing a sing/rap style in Dutch.
In 2010, there were 3 different T-Spoon formations for all tours, all of them official: Blondi &amp; Raw Jawz, Linda &amp; Shamrock and T Spoon DJ Squad. Remy de Groot explained that "We have the past, present &amp; future, the past is T-spoon Reloaded with Shamrock &amp; Linda, the present is the fresh young T-Spoon with Raw Jawz &amp; Blondi, and the future is T-Spoon DJ Squad, for every generation there is something to enjoy about T-Spoon".
In 2012, T-Spoon released a collaboration with Dirty House Bastards featuring Akon titled "Dubhop Shawty".
In 2013, T-Spoon released a new single titled "Ticket to the Tropics". It is a cover of a song released in 1985 by Dutch artist Gerard Joling.
Origin of the name.
Legend says that Shamrock said while stirring a cup of tea "I'd rather have a gold record than a gold tea spoon any day". "That's it," exclaimed Prince Peration, "That's the name", and so the name T-Spoon was born. More recently, Remy de Groot explained that the name actually came from a western TV show in which the sheriff was called Teaspoon.

Vislink Technologies

Vislink Technologies, Inc. is an American technology company that specializes in the collection, delivery, management and distribution of high quality live video and data. Founded as xG Technology in Sarasota, Florida in 2002, the company had acquired both Vislink and Integrated Microwave Technologies by 2017. In February 2019, xG Technology formally changed its name to Vislink Technologies. The company is headquartered in Hackettstown, New Jersey and has regional offices in Billerica, Massachusetts and Anaheim, California, as well as global offices in the United Kingdom, Dubai and Singapore. Vislink is a publicly traded company listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market.
Vislink has created a portfolio of intellectual property that includes cognitive radio, interference mitigation and self-organizing wireless network technologies for mobile services using licensed or unlicensed radio spectrum. In November 2020, Vislink was named a Deloitte Technology Fast 500 winner, and was among the fastest-growing North American technology companies.
In February 2021, the company announced its "Connected Edge" strategy and began a pivot towards edge computing aimed at further expansion into sporting events, military contracts, satellite communications and first responder networks.
XMax.
xMax developed by xG Technology, Inc. is a cognitive radio based mobile VoIP and computer networking system operating in the license-free ISM 900 MHz band (902–928 MHz). xMax is built upon an end-to-end Internet Protocol (IP) system infrastructure that includes a line of base stations, mobile switching centers (MSC), handsets and modems.
xMax currently operates in the unlicensed 900 MHz ISM band, although it has been designed to be programmed for operation in any licensed or unlicensed frequency from approximately 300 MHz to 3 GHz.
The xMax system is designed to allow mobile operators to utilize free, unlicensed 902–928 MHz spectrum, which is available in most of the Americas. 
Unlicensed spectrum is an affordable alternative to licensed spectrum – such as what broadcasters use to transmit their signals. Any company or consumer can use unlicensed spectrum simply by following well-known rules.
Performance claims.
A press report was published in 2005 quoting inventor Joseph Bobier.
The technology was said to compete with WiMax, but details were initially not disclosed.
By 2006, the company announced it had "completed" the technology after six years of development.
In 2009, a blogger wrote that he witnessed a xMax mobile VoIP pilot network operated by the company in Fort Lauderdale: "xMax worked well and is real. When you realize that this company may have found a way to take a frequency riddled with wireless garbage and turn it into a fully functioning wireless voice and data network you start to see how much of a game changer this could be for the wireless industry."
From 2007 through 2009, Phil Karn published some analysis of the technology claims.

The Prebendal School

The Prebendal School is a private preparatory school in Chichester, situated adjacent to the Chichester Cathedral precinct. It is a boarding and day school educating the cathedral choristers. The school has ancient origins as the medieval cathedral song school at the thirteenth-century school house in West Street.
In 2020, "The Telegraph" named The Prebendal School as one of the best-value independent schools in the country.
In January 2023, the school announced that its recent ISI inspection in November had found the school to be Excellent in all areas.
History.
The Prebendal is the oldest school in Sussex and probably dates back to the foundation of Chichester Cathedral in the 11th century when it was a 'song school', teaching and housing the choristers. It was later extended to admitting other boys from the city and neighbouring areas. In 1497, it was re-founded as a grammar school by the Bishop of Chichester, Edward Story, who also attached it to the Prebend of Highleigh in Chichester Cathedral, hence the name of the school.
The thirteenth-century school house with its narrow tower still stands in West Street.
Girls were introduced into the school in 1972. The school is now a co-educational, day and boarding preparatory school for children between 3 and 13 years of age.
Due to its financial position, exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, the school confirmed in April 2021 that it was seeking external financial support. In July 2021, it confirmed that it had been acquired by the Alpha Schools Group.
Structure.
The school consists of the Pre-Prep (Nursery to Year 2) and the Prep (Years 3–8). Each pupil is a member of a school house, which are named after former Bishops of Chichester. There is also a boarding house that accommodate up to 46 boarders. The school remains open for Choristers in the weeks prior to Christmas, Easter and the Southern Cathedrals Festival. The Nursery, Pelicans, is open throughout the normal school holidays.
Academia.
Pupils are taught the Common Entrance or Common Academic Scholarship examination to senior independent schools, offered by the Independent Schools Examinations Board.
Heads.
The following list includes Heads of the school prior to its re-founding in 1497:

Procedural modeling

Procedural modeling is an umbrella term for a number of techniques in computer graphics to create 3D models and textures from sets of rules that may be easily changed over time. L-Systems, fractals, and generative modeling are procedural modeling techniques since they apply algorithms for producing scenes. The set of rules may either be embedded into the algorithm, configurable by parameters, or the set of rules is separate from the evaluation engine. The output is called procedural content, which can be used in computer games, films, be uploaded to the internet, or the user may edit the content manually. Procedural models often exhibit database amplification, meaning that large scenes can be generated from a much smaller number of rules. If the employed algorithm produces the same output every time, the output need not be stored. Often, it suffices to start the algorithm with the same random seed to achieve this.
Although all modeling techniques on a computer require algorithms to manage and store data at some point, procedural modeling focuses on creating a model from a rule set, rather than editing the model manually by using user input, in order to make modifying model in the future easier. The parameters that define a model may be dependent on parameters or geometry from another model making modelling process very flexible. Procedural modeling is often applied when it would be too cumbersome to create a 3D model using generic 3D modelers, or when more specialized tools are required. This is often the case for plants, architecture or landscapes.

Château de Guermantes

Château de Guermantes () is a Château located in Guermantes, Seine-et-Marne, northern France. It is a listed monument since 1944.
Construction and design.
Construction of the Château de Guermantes was undertaken by Claude Viole (died 1638), whose family had possessed the fief of "Le Chemin" since the mid sixteenth century. Paulin Pondre (1650-1723) purchased the property in 1698. He engaged Jules Hardouin-Mansart for renovations to the building, completed in 1710 (Ministère de la culture), and André Le Nôtre to lay out the garden. Pondre was "receveur des finances" at Lyon and had become one of the most powerful financiers of the reign of Louis XIV; he was appointed President of the Cour des Comptes in 1713. Guermantes was the scene of memorable fêtes.
Guermantes is built of brick with stone facings and quoins, in an H-plan, with projecting pavilions flanking the "corps de logis", under tall sloping slate roofs and tall chimney stacks. The house stands in a large park. The front is now approached in the English manner, with a drive sweeping to the side and an unbroken expanse of lawn. On the garden front, the house stands on a terrace with steps leading down to the former parterre, which is now lawn, and the expanse of water in the formally shaped "pièce d'eau", from the far end of which the château is reflected in its entirety.
The original furnishings of Guermantes have been scattered, but rooms retain their seventeenth- and eighteenth-century "boiseries". The family Pondre maintained the property until 1929, by which time Marcel Proust had employed "Guermantes" for the family at the top of the French society he was describing. There has never been a duchesse de Guermantes; Proust's "château de Guermantes", unreachably beyond the limits of family walks from Combray then purchased by the Verdurins, was based on the duc de Sully's Château de Villebon, Eure-et-Loir.
Ownership by John Law.
In 1719 the Scottish economist and financier John Law purchased Guermantes for 800,000 livres. He only enjoyed possession for a matter of months. When the economic bubble created by his Mississippi Scheme burst, his life came under threat and he begged Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, the Regent, for permission to leave Paris. The Regent initially only granted Law permission to retire to the Château de Guermantes, and it was there that he spent his final days in France. On the evening of 17 December 1720, Law set off from the Château de Guermantes and fled France never to return. Paulin Pondre was able to take possession once more; his family were dispossessed at the Revolution.
Use as a film location.
The real Guermantes provided locations for Philippe de Broca for "Cartouche" (1962), "Moonraker" (1979), the Polish director Andrzej Wajda for "Danton", Miloš Forman for "Amadeus" (1984) and Stephen Frears for "Dangerous Liaisons" (1988). Guermantes is not open to the public. It lies from Euro Disneyland.

Ooh... You Are Awful

Ooh... You Are Awful (U.S. title: Get Charlie Tully) is a 1972 British comedy film directed by Cliff Owen and starring Dick Emery, Derren Nesbitt, Ronald Fraser and Cheryl Kennedy. It was written by John Warren and John Singer. It is a feature-length adaptation of "The Dick Emery Show" (BBC TV, 1963–1981). It was Emery's sole starring film.
Plot.
Conmen Charlie Tully and Reggie Peek have successfully conned a couple of Italian men, and are making an easy escape with £500,000. Flushed with success, Tully is unable to resist running a "quick and easy" con on a passing American tourist, but Tully is arrested. While Tully is imprisoned, Peek manages to escape and deposits the £500,000 in a Swiss bank account. Peek meets Tully on his release, intending to give him the bank account number. But Peek has been having an affair with the sister of London crime lord Sid Sabbath, and his reunion with Tully is cut short when Peek is murdered, on the orders of Sabbath.
Peek has left a record of the bank account number, tattooed on the bottoms of four young women. Tully adopts a range of disguises to track down each woman in turn to see her naked bottom.
Throughout, Tully is confronted by members of Sid Sabbath's gang, with orders to kill as only for them to mysteriously die themselves. Tully thinks he is "lucky", while Sabbath thinks Tully is a one-man army. Neither realise Tully is being secretly guarded by Italian gangsters.
Production.
The National Film Finance Corporation invested £62,000 in the film. It was the first NFFC investment following the ending of their Government funding, with new finance obtained from a consortium of merchant banks. The NFFC decided to only make "safe" films, and "Ooh... You Are Awful" was the first of these.
Liza Goddard said that her nude scene in this film was a "horrible, embarrassing experience".
Reception.
The film made a profit.
"The Monthly Film Bulletin" wrote: "Often wasted on television, Dick Emery's considerable talent for comic impersonations is here woven into an entertaining plot which finds plausible excuses for him to don an assortment of disguises and appear in drag (as a bereaved mother, a blowsy woman police officer), as a diplomat, or as the familiar butler figure, Lampwick. Authors John Warren and John Singer have avoided the danger of fragmenting their story into a series of unrelated sketches; and though they don't invariably resist clichés (of character and situation), there is still much to enjoy. Cliff Owen's direction is imaginative; there is an engaging, if mild, element of black comedy (at one point Charlie nonchalantly flicks his cigarette ash into the urn containing Reggie's cremated remains); and although the film is essentially Emery's vehicle, there are some amusing cameos – most notably, Brian Oulton's consolatory funeral director and Stefan Gryff's Mafia boss"
"The Observer" called it "the best British comedy in many years."
Leslie Halliwell wrote: "Amusing star vehicle with plenty of room for impersonations and outrageous jokes."
"The Radio Times Guide to Films" gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: "This is a McGill seaside postcard come to boozy nudge-nudge wink-wink life and if that's to your taste then it belts along like a runaway Blackpool train."

Tetsuya Ishida

Tetsuya Ishida (石田 徹也, Ishida Tetsuya, June 16, 1973 – May 23, 2005) was a contemporary Japanese painter known for his surrealist portrayal of late-20th and early-21st century Japanese city life. His works typically depict hyperrealistic boys and men whose bodies are integrated into everyday appliances, industrial machinery, civic architecture, and animal forms. Ishida's paintings address the themes of isolation, consumerism, academic &amp; professional workplace anxieties, and urban banality.
Ishida quickly ascended the ranks of Japan's contemporary art scene after several of his paintings were exhibited at multiple galleries in the cultural hub of Ginza, and his works were featured in Christie's first ever auction on East Asian avant-garde art (alongside the works of a young Takashi Murakami) in 1998. 
As a member of Japan's "Lost Generation" (1991 - 2001), Ishida was a firsthand witness to the country's economic decline that began in the 1990s and extended into the 2000s. Subsequently, the angst that characterized his age group affected his perceptions of Japan's near-future where he viewed it as a bleak, urbanized atmosphere dominated by technocratic occupations that drain the life from its recent university graduate and middle-aged salarymen employees. With mental illness as a crucial attribute of his work, Ishida's conflicted views of Japan's outlook took a toll on his personal life and has been considered a contributing factor in his death after he was struck by a train in 2005. 
Early life and education (1973 - 1996).
Tetsuya Ishida was born in Yaizu, Shizuoka Prefecture, the youngest of four sons. His mother, Sachiko, was a housewife and his father, Yoshihiro, was a member of Yaizu City Council.
Ishida's earliest exposure to art occurred in 1981 when the illustrations of Lithuanian-American Social Realist Ben Shahn were exhibited in Yaizu. Several of Shahn's pieces portrayed the historic 1954 Lucky Dragon Incident in which Japanese fishermen aboard a tuna boat were exposed to fallout radiation from a nearby nuclear bomb test conducted by the American military. Shahn's staunchly objective, black-and-white depiction of the nuclear blast's massive mushroom cloud unleashed Ishida's desire "to become a painter like Ben Shahn".
During his formative years, Ishida participated in two creative contests that directed his lifelong artistic focus on social commentary. Shortly after the Ben Shahn exhibition, Ishida submitted an essay titled "Masshirofunekun" ("Mr. White Boat") to a local writing contest in response to the imagery from Shahn's Lucky Dragon illustrations (1958). One excerpt from the article clearly demonstrates Ishida's opposition to the use of nuclear military technology:"From there, the entire body became sick and suffered. The nuclear testing caused hair to fall out and blood loss. They were in pain and could not get up to go to work. It's really a tragedy. Why would humans use H-bombs to kill each other?"In 1984, the Shizuoka District Legal Affairs Bureau launched a human rights-themed manga competition to which Ishida submitted an entry entitled "Yowaimonoijime wa yameyou!" ("Stop Bullying Weaklings!"). This manga piece underscores Ishida's sharp opposition to humanity's over-dependence on technology and foreshadows one of the most prevalent thematic elements throughout his career.
In 1993, Ishida attended "Parallel Visions: Modern Artists and Outsider Art" at the Setagaya Art Museum, the first exhibition in Japan focused solely on outsider art (individuals with no formal artistic training and without any professional art world affiliations). Most of the artists on display endured varying degrees of mental illness. While there is no clear evidence of any clinical diagnosis, many art historians speculate Ishida's fascination with these artists and his later pictorial representations of mental anguish was because he, too, was afflicted with similar conditions.
Upon graduation from Yaizu Central High School in 1992, Ishida enrolled at Musashino Art University where he earned a degree in Visual Communication Design in 1996. Ishida's parents strongly disapproved of his decision to become an artist and refused to offer any financial support, desiring instead that he pursue a career in academia or chemistry.
Career (1996 - 2005).
Ishida and his friend, film director Isamu Hirabayashi, formed a multimedia company in 1996 to collaborate on film and art fusion projects. Their partnership ended due to the Japanese recession in the mid-to-late 1990s that forced the duo to transition into graphic design. Ishida disliked marketing and subsequently decided to launch a solo artistic career.
Between 1996 and 2005, Ishida's distinctly surrealistic style attracted a sizable following. His participation in various solo and group exhibitions across the country garnered numerous awards, and Ishida became a dominant fixture in Japan's contemporary art scene.
Tokyo's upscale Ginza shopping district is renowned for its promotion of arts consumption for the general public through exhibitions organized inside department stores. Participation in these exclusive shows was considered a significant accomplishment for emerging Japanese artists. Ginza's reputation for elaborate art shows attracted international figures in modern and contemporary art such as Anselm Kiefer whose major 1993 retrospective Melancholia was held at the Seibu Museum (now Sezon Museum of Modern Art) inside the Seibu Department Store. Ishida was featured in over a dozen Ginza exhibitions that expanded his audience by rendering his works more readily accessible to the general public and art critics.
In October 1998, prominent Dutch art historian Maria Kaldenhoven launched the Western art world's first auction of Asian avant-garde art at Christie's London. Her intent was to highlight the latest developments in "groundbreaking" contemporary East Asian art. Although a Chinese art specialist, Kaldenhoven was captivated by the works of Ishida and Takashi Murakami. She regarded their paintings as reflective of Japan's rising influence in the global contemporary art market. Two Ishida canvases were auctioned alongside two Murakami helium paintings. While neither of his paintings sold, Ishida's inclusion in the auction directly contributed to a surge in popularity of his work among Western and Eastern audiences. In 2007, both aforementioned Ishida paintings were posthumously sold at Christie's London for $530,000 and $270,000, respectively.
As his artistic output increased, Ishida's parents eventually realized the magnitude of their son's skill and commitment to painting, and they came to embrace and appreciate his art.
Artistic style, content, and themes.
From the mid-1990s until his death in 2005, Ishida produced a total of 186 paintings, many of which were not discovered until several years later.
Ishida's works convey a sense of foreboding and gloominess through their muted color palettes dominated by blacks, grays, and pale shades of blue. Boys and men often feature as the primary subjects with each assigned a specific role: high school &amp; university-level students and white-collar salarymen. Their faces are almost always identical to one another, and each communicates feelings of pain, hopelessness, and/or exhaustion. The oversized, highly naturalistic bodies are enmeshed within rundown machinery, municipal structures, and consumer products ("Cargo", 1997; "Gripe", 1997; "Prisoner", 1999). Ishida's works are frequently described as "Kafkaesque" because he frequently combined the bodies of humans, animals, and insects ("Long Distance", 1999). Art historians and curators observed similarities between the subjects' faces and Ishida's despite his repeated denial that they were self-portraits. Rather, Ishida implied his paintings were a reflection of Japanese society.
Ishida's corpus of work encompasses three major overarching themes: Japan's identity and role in today's world; Japanese social, educational, and professional structures; and the struggle of the Japanese to adapt to the rapid advancement of technology. Entrenched within these themes, motifs of isolation, anxiety, crisis of identity, skepticism, and claustrophobia heavily permeate all of Ishida's work. The violent disfigurement and mutilation of Ishida's subjects allegorize the pressures placed upon students and the labor force by Japanese society: the persistent obligation to obtain high-salary careers and forced conformity to arduous working conditions in an increasingly mechanized environment ("Recalled", 1998).
During an archived Tokyo TV television interview from the Kirin Art Gallery feature "The Grand Art Masters", Ishida stated that regardless of whether he enjoyed the artistic process, he felt a compulsive duty to paint "people at mercy of Japan's contradicting nature of its social systems for as long as they exist".
While there is a collective understanding of the main themes behind Ishida's work, several ambiguities related to his subjects remain. One of the most discussed topics references Ishida's repeated insertion of plastic shopping bags in many of his works. He consistently refused to explain their symbolic significance, and no recent scholarship has revealed its function.
Influences.
Ishida's keen observations of Japan's turbulent "Lost Decade" (1991 - 2001) strongly informed the content and themes of his paintings. The country's economic boom of the 1980s ended with a recession in 1991 that carried over into the 21st Century. Consequently, young adults who graduated from universities within this ten-year span faced much greater difficulties securing employment; thousands of recent graduates were unemployed or underemployed. The heightened pressure and anxiety they experienced led them to become labeled by society as the "Lost Generation". Concurrently, Japan underwent multiple social and political crises that further intensified its existing problems: the 1995 sarin gas attacks in the Tokyo Metro system by the doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo; the decimation of urban infrastructure following the 1995 Kobe Earthquake; and, the 1997 Kobe Child Murders committed by a fourteen-year-old boy.
As part of the "Lost Generation", Ishida's personal life is intrinsically connected to the narratives of his paintings. His parents and school officials continually pressured him to obtain high marks on scholastic examinations and to acquire gainful employment outside the visual arts sector. Ishida's lack of interest in alternative professions coupled with societal constraints caused Ishida to struggle deeply with his individualism.
Beyond personal experiences, Ishida received great artistic inspiration from an eclectic range of subjects:
Personal life.
Ishida shared anecdotes of his parents' bewilderment at both the artistic style and the grim nature of his works. His mother was particularly upset by one of his paintings that she viewed as extremely morbid. Ishida assured her it represented his happiness captured in a moment of uninhibited freedom of expression.
Ishida was romantically involved with Hiromi Toyoda, but later ended the relationship after he told her "I'm so happy being with you that I cannot paint anymore".
In the final chapter of the exhibition catalogue for the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia's 2019 retrospective "Ishida: Self-Portrait of Other", friend and former artistic collaborator Isamu Hirabayashi contributed an essay that described their early time together as well as Ishida's final years and death. Following the end of their creative partnership, Hirabayashi stated they maintained limited contact, but noted that Ishida's last residence was in Sagami Ono, a suburb of Sagamihara, that enabled him easy access to the expansive Seikado art supply store.
Ishida worked in a print shop and as a night watchman to provide for his excessive spending on artistic materials. Hirabayashi confirmed that Ishida's mental health appeared to rapidly decline due to a contentious relationship with the print shop manager that "made his life miserable", and the wrongful accusation and termination of his watchman position following the accidental death of a co-worker crushed by a truck.
Death and legacy.
On May 23, 2005, Ishida died after he was struck by a passing train at a level crossing in Machida, Tokyo. Art critics, historians, and curators inferred the tragedy was an act of suicide, citing that the young man and the recurring themes of mental illness, overwork, and death in his art were self-portrait depictions of Ishida himself.
In 2007, Ishida's family donated 21 of his paintings to the Shizuoka Prefectural Museum of Art (静岡県立美術館|Shizuoka-kenritsu Bijutsukan) (his hometown Yaizu is located in Shizuoka Prefecture) for permanent display.
Posthumously auctioned paintings.
In 2006 at Christie's Hong Kong "Asian Contemporary Art" auction, the pre-auction sale estimate of the late Ishida's painting "Untitled 2001" (oil on canvas, 130.5 x 190.3 cm; 51 1/4 x 75 inches) was HK$60,000 - HK$80,000 (US$7,745-US$10,326). However, on November 26 "Untitled 2001" sold for HK$780,000 (US$100,681), ten times its original estimate.
In 2008, "Untitled 2001" was again put up in Christie's "Asian Contemporary Art" auction. In less than two years, Ishida's painting dramatically appreciated three times its previous value, and generated an impressive HK$2,900,000 (US$375,885) - the high end of its 2008 estimate of HK$2,000,000-HK$3,000,000 (US$259,231-US$388,847).
