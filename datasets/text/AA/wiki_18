Mergoscia

Mergoscia is a municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
History.
Mergoscia is first mentioned in 1061 as "Mergossia", though this comes from a copy of the original from 1402. In 1300 it was mentioned as "Mergosia". In 1313, Mergoscia split from the "Vicinanza" of Minusio and Brione. However, the majority of the common property of the former "vicinanza" remained undivided until 1952. To avoid paying a tithe to the nobles of Locarno, at the beginning of the 15th century, the village split from Locarno to join the valley community of Verzasca and Valle Maggia.
The village church, split away from the mother church of Locarno, S. Vittore in Muralto, in 1591. The parish church of San Gottardo was built in 1597, over the foundation of a church that was first mentioned in 1338. The bell tower dates from 1697.
Most of the villagers worked as farmers, shepherds or cattle herders. Already in the Middle Ages they had a seasonal migration between the alpine pastures and the winter pastures in the Magadino valley. Until 1920 they shared grazing rights with Minusio and Locarno and owned part of the shared Terricciole territory. The scarce economic resources forced many villagers to emigrate oversees, starting in the 15th century and running until the 19th century. In 1900 the old road was built to the village. The tunnel of Mergoscia was built in 1997–98. With easier access to the village, many of the houses became vacation homes.

Minusio

Minusio is a municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
History.
In the Ceresole section, a significant Iron Age necropolis (c. 6th-5th century BC) was discovered. It held about 20 graves and rich grave goods. Nearby, several Roman graveyards from the 1st and 2nd Centuries AD, were discovered. The Roman graveyards are among the most important in Ticino because of the complexity of the system and the amount of material. A discovery in 1936 found about 30 graves. In the Roman era, Minusio was a minor settlement outside of Muralto, which was the center of the Roman presence in the Locarno area.
Minusio is first mentioned in 1061 as "Menuxio", though this comes from a copy of the original from 1402. In 1200 it was mentioned as "Menuxio". It used to be known by its German name, "Maniss", though this is no longer used. During the Middle Ages, it was a village, which, together with Brione sopra Minusio and Mergoscia formed a "Vicinanza". By the time that the village laws were written down in 1313, Minusio had separated from Mergoscia. Brione dissolved as an independent village gradually until 1479 when it ceased to exist independently. Traces of the old "vicinanza" remained until 1952 in the so-called "Comunella dei tre comuni" which held common property and court rights. Minusio owned fishing and grazing rights in the Magadino valley, and shared ownership of the Terricciole region with Mergoscia and Locarno until 1920. The town mayor was picked by the four "squadre" (town sections) of Rivapiana, Cadogno, Frizzi and Mezzo, each in turn. Between 1803 and 1839, Minusio was the capital of the district of Navegna. In 1839, it supported the anti-Confederation side in the constitutional struggles. When they lost the conflict, it lost not only its role as district capital to Tenero, but was also occupied by the military.
The town church was led by a chaplain under the archpriest of S. Vittore in Locarno. The village of Mondacce became part of the parish of Gordola in 1698 and then in 1921, the parish of Tenero. Minusio became an independent parish in 1798, and in 1949 was granted a provost. The parish church of San Rocco was first built at the end of the 15th century, but was completely rebuilt in 1795–1801. The oldest religious building in the municipality is the Church of San Quirico in Rivapiana which was first mentioned in 1313. In the late 18th century an extension was added to the church. It contains remains of frescoes from the 13th-14th and the 15th-16th Centuries as well as a fragment of a Gallo-Roman votive altar. The church bell tower originally functioned as a guard tower. The church of S. Maria delle Grazie was erected at the beginning of the 17th century. The Holy Cross Chapel was built in the 18th century. The chapel of Santa Maria dei Sette Dolori (1630) is attached to the Casa di Ferro, a military base, which had built by Peter Ammann a Pro in 1558.
In the 18th and 19th Centuries several notable villas were built, though some of them have been demolished or have collapsed. However, several Art Nouveau villas from the 20th century are still occupied. The Villa La Baronata in Mappo dates from the 17th century and in the 19th century housed several famous refugees. The Elisarion villa was built in 1925-29 as a residence and temple. It was taken over in 1981 by the municipality and set up a cultural center.
La Baronata.
It was here that Giovanni Antonio Marcacci (1769–1854) built La Baronata as a summer house. The building was bought by Mikhail Bakunin in 1873 with money he obtained from Carlo Cafiero. They planned that possession of the building would give Bakunin the status of a land-owner, helping him gain Swiss citizenship, and to provide premises for storing arms and providing accommodation in aid of the anarchist international. A second building was erected, a lake dug and a number of fruit trees planted. With the addition of a cow, a carriage and two horses, a milkmaid and a groom were employed. When Bakunin's wife, Antonia Kwiatkowska, was on her way there in July 1874, her lover, Carlo Gambuzzi informed her that the house had been bought through the abuse of Cafiero's generosity. On her arrival, Bakunin originally denied this and at first persuaded Cafiero to agree. However, on reflection, Cafiero told Bakunin on 15 July that he had indeed abused their friendship and that he would not spend any more money, thought or energy on La Baronata, rather devoting the fraction left of his inheritance on buying weapons for the proposed revolution in Italy. "The days following the 15th were a veritable hell" Bakunin later wrote. On 25 July Bakunin signed over the deeds of the building to Cafiero and resolved to die on the barricades in Bologna.
Following a career as a revolutionary anarchist, Cafiero suffered a mental breakdown whilst in prison in Italy in 1882. He returned briefly to La Baronata, but went back to Italy once again in 1883.

Usages of Barcelona

The Usages of Barcelona (, ; ) were the customs that form the basis for the Catalan Constitutions. They are the fundamental laws and basic rights of Catalonia, dating back to their codification in the twelfth century.
The Usages combined fragments of Roman and Visigothic law with the resolutions of the comital court of Barcelona and the religious canons of ecclesiastic synods. The first Usages were compiled and codified by Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona (1035–1076), to repair the deficiencies of Gothic law. However, the evidence for Ramon's work dates from the codes of James the Conqueror of a later date (reigned 1213–1276). James, seeing that some judges ruled by Gothic law and some by Roman law, according to a tradition of "usus terrae" (local custom), approached the Catalan Courts in 1251 to establish the primacy of the Usages. Though the Usages applied legally only to the Barcelonan county, in practice they were applied to the entire Principality of Catalonia.
The Usages incorporated several other competing codes of the same era:
The oldest manuscript containing the Usages dates from the end of the 12th century. Between the 15th and 18th centuries, they were copied frequently. The Nueva Planta decrees superseded them with the central legislation of the Bourbons, though continued to have some force.

San Nazzaro, Switzerland

San Nazzaro is a former municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
On 25 April 2010, the former municipalities of Caviano, Contone, Gerra Gambarogno, Indemini, Magadino, Piazzogna, San Nazzaro, Sant'Abbondio and Vira Gambarogno merged in the new municipality of Gambarogno.
History.
San Nazzaro is first mentioned in 1258 as "sancto Nazario".
In the hamlet of Vairano, cremation urns have been found which may date back to the Bronze Age cremations. Additionally, Roman era pottery and coins have also been discovered. In the hamlet of Mossana, a number of Roman graves were discovered. In the hamlet of Taverna, there used to stand a tower, which had probably given by Frederick I Barbarossa in 1186 to the Orelli family. The tower later passed into the possession of the nobility of Locarno and was used in the control of trade in the Upper Lake Maggiore and Gambarogno river areas. Even in the Middle Ages it was a center place in the Gambarogno valley. In the 13th century, the "Vicinanza" meetings were held in the church square in Taverna. In 1487, the Gambarogno became independent of Locarno, and San Nazzaro became the seat of the Podestà and the court.
It was part of the parish of Vira, until it became an independent parish in 1558. The parish church of SS Nazzaro e Celso was first mentioned in 1258. It was rebuilt in 1790 in the classicist style and enlarged.
The population lived, primarily, from agriculture and grazing. The local economy was supplemented in the 15th century by emigration, mostly of bricklayers and builders, to Italy. In the second half of the 20th century, there was a strong population growth, as the village became home to a few tourist hotels and many second homes.

Caoimhe Butterly

Caoimhe Butterly is an Irish human rights campaigner, psychotherapist, educator and filmmaker who has spent over twenty years working in humanitarian and social justice contexts in Haiti, Guatemala, Mexico, Palestine, Iraq, Lebanon and with refugee communities in Europe.
She is a peace activist who has worked with people with AIDS in Zimbabwe, the homeless in New York, and with Zapatistas in Mexico as well as more recently in the Middle East and Haiti. In 2002, during an Israeli Defence Forces attack in Jenin, she was shot by an Israeli soldier. She spent 16 days inside the compound where Yasser Arafat was besieged in Ramallah. She was named by "Time" magazine as one of their Europeans of the Year in 2003 and in 2016 won the Irish Council for Civil Liberties Human Rights Film award for her coverage of the refugee crisis. Butterly is a pacifist and a member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), an organisation that seeks non-violent alternatives to armed intifada by mobilising international civil society.
Early life.
Caoimhe Butterly was born in Dublin to a family therapist. Her father's work as a United Nations economist moved the family from Ireland to Zimbabwe when she was a young child. She grew up in Canada, Mauritius, and Zimbabwe due to her father's work with the United Nations. She spent time working in the New York Catholic Worker Movement, then moved to Latin America where she spent three years living with indigenous communities in Guatemala and in Chiapas, Mexico. She also lived in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank for a year. She has visited Iraq on numerous occasions, she visited Lebanon, where she protested British prime minister Tony Blair's visit to the country after he allowed US bomb shipments to be sent to Israel via Britain during the 2006 Lebanon War.
Butterly was brought up in a culture of liberation theology, which, she says, "deeply inspired" her to engage in human rights work She spent time working as a volunteer in AIDS hospices in Zimbabwe as a teenager. At a very young age, she says, she developed a deep sense of duty. "I've always felt the need to almost a painful degree of needing to stand up against injustices in whatever contexts they lie." She left school at 18, wanting to travel, and Then after high school headed to New York, where she spent a year working in the city's Catholic Worker house, which was founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in 1933.
Humanitarian work and activism.
After New York, in 1998, she moved to Latin America where she spent three years living with indigenous and Zapatista communities in Guatemala and Chiapas. She later worked with refugees and internally displaced communities in the West Bank, Gaza, Iraq and Lebanon, which included work as a volunteer EMT with ambulance services.
In 2001 she spent 10 days fasting in front of the offices of the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, in protest at the Irish government's decision to allow US warplanes to refuel at Shannon Airport on their way to Afghanistan. She was arrested while trying to block the runway.
Siege of the Arafat compound.
In April 2002, she spent 16 days with other volunteers inside the besieged Muqaata compound in Ramallah, in solidarity with the Palestinians and to protest the Israeli military presence in the area. She was later wounded during a military incursion into Jenin refugee camp.
Jenin incident.
On 22 November 2002, during an Israeli military operation in Jenin amid the Second Intifada, Butterly, then 24 years old, was shot by an Israeli soldier and suffered a thigh injury. She had been trying to lead a group of Palestinian children to safety.
In an interview in "The Guardian", journalist Katie Barlow reported being inspired to meet Butterly by the footage of her blocking Israel Defense Forces tanks as they fired over her head, and stories of her standing in the line of fire between soldiers and Palestinian children, as the IDF threatened to "make her a hero". In the report, Barlow described how Butterly ran straight, despite the continuing fire, toward a disabled Palestinian boy who was shot by an Israeli sniper. Later a Red Crescent ambulance arrived at the scene and amid continuing gunfire, the paramedics got the boy into the vehicle, the snipers managed to shoot through the ambulance window, shattering glass all over the boy, and nearly killing the local cameraman who was filming a report. The boy would survive, but was paralysed from the waist down.
After being shot, Butterly, who had by then spent more than a year standing in the path of Israeli tanks and troops, refused to leave: "I'm going nowhere. I am staying until this occupation ends. I have the right to be here, a responsibility to be here. So does anyone who knows what is going on here."
Iraq War.
Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Butterly campaigned against the Irish government's decision to allow the United States military to use Shannon Airport. She was initially a signatory to the Pitstop Ploughshares action that disabled a US warplane at Shannon in February 2003, but decided ultimately not to participate out of a desire to travel to Iraq in solidarity with civilians there. At a 2003 Belfast summit between US President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Butterly was arrested and dragged away by her hair for smearing red jam on the riot shields of two policemen. "There is no such thing as a benign occupation" she says. "It's time to focus again on what is happening in Baghdad."
Stay in Beirut.
After the 2006 war in Lebanon, British Prime Minister Tony Blair went on a political trip to the Middle East for meetings with leaders of the region. A feeling of anger against Blair was mounting in Lebanon, in relation to his stance during the war, his refusal to call for an immediate ceasefire and his aligning of his policies with those of American President George W. Bush in support of the Israeli military operation. Butterly interrupted Blair's press conference with the Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, accusing Blair of complicity in the recent Israeli bombardment of Lebanon. "This visit is an insult", "Shame on you Tony Blair" Butterly shouted as Siniora and Blair spoke at Siniora's office complex. She held a banner saying "Boycott Israeli apartheid" in front of live TV cameras, until security guards holding her by arms and legs carried her out. Blair and Siniora stood quietly as she shouted.
Iain Hook incident.
In 2005, she gave written eyewitness testimony in the inquest into the killing of UNRWA relief works project manager Iain Hook by an Israeli military sniper. Butterly was also shot in the foot during this incident.
Gaza flotilla.
Butterly was aboard a flotilla bringing relief supplies to Gaza during the Gaza flotilla raid on 31 May 2010.
In July 2025, she joined the first leg of the "Handala", another ship carrying activists and humanitarian supplies with the goal of breaking the tightened Israeli blockade amid the Gaza war.
Other ventures.
In the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, she worked with mobile phone healthcare clinics and psycho-social projects there. She later returned to third level education in her early 30s, completing Masters in Development Studies and in Systemic Pschotherapy.
Current work.
Following 15 years working with humanitarian and rights projects in the Middle East, Butterly returned to Ireland. She is based in Dublin, though continues to work with trauma-informed psycho-social support programmes and Search and Rescue response with refugees in Greece, Calais, Italy, Lebanon and the Central Mediterranean. She also lectures and works in critical Development Education and writes for various refugee-related publications.

Step in the Name of Love

"Step in the Name of Love (Remix)" is a song by R&amp;B singer R. Kelly. Taken from the 2003 album "Chocolate Factory", the song became the tenth single from Kelly (and the final one to date) to reach number one on the R&amp;B chart, particularly on the strength of the song's remix. It also peaked at number nine on the pop charts on December 2, 2003. The original "Step in the Name of Love", which is on the unreleased 2002 album "Loveland" as well as the "Chocolate Factory" album, described a dance style initially created in Chicago called "stepping". That dance, and the music associated with it, was heavily featured on disc one of his 2004 double album, "Happy People/U Saved Me". The song became an impromptu "anthem" for steppers and the dance. In the UK, the song was a double A-side with "Thoia Thoing".
Critical reception.
"The Village Voice" critic Robert Christgau found the remix of "Step in the Name of Love" to be "hugely engaging". However, he believed it was "cavalier" or "stupid" for Kelly, amid his child pornography charges, to declare himself "the pied piper of R&amp;B" given the moniker's "pedophilic implications".
Music video.
The music video is directed by Little X.
Legacy.
"Step in the Name of Love (Remix)" took 43 weeks to reach number one on the R&amp;B/Hip Hop chart, making it the longest trip to number one in the chart's history. The song has spent 70 weeks on the same chart and is one of the songs that has spent the most weeks on that chart.

Théophile De Donder

Théophile Ernest De Donder (; 19 August 1872 – 11 May 1957) was a Belgian mathematician, physicist and chemist famous for his work (published in 1923) in developing correlations between the Newtonian concept of chemical affinity and the Gibbsian concept of free energy.
Education.
He received his doctorate in physics and mathematics from the Université Libre de Bruxelles in 1899, for a thesis entitled "Sur la Théorie des Invariants Intégraux" ("On the Theory of Integral Invariants").
Career.
He was professor between 1911 and 1942, at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. Initially he continued the work of Henri Poincaré and Élie Cartan. From 1914 on, he was influenced by the work of Albert Einstein and was an enthusiastic proponent of the theory of relativity. He gained significant reputation in 1923, when he developed his definition of chemical affinity. He pointed out a connection between the chemical affinity and the Gibbs free energy.
He is considered the father of thermodynamics of irreversible processes. De Donder's work was later developed further by his doctoral student Ilya Prigogine. De Donder was an associate and friend of Albert Einstein.
He was in 1927, one of the participants of the fifth Solvay Conference on Physics, that took place at the International Solvay Institute for Physics in Belgium. Additionally, De Donder attended the Solvay Conferences of 1924, 1930, and 1948.

Joseph Horton

Joseph Horton (12 August 1915 – 6 November 1998) was an English first-class cricketer who played 62 matches for Worcestershire in the 1930s.
Born in Colwall Green, Herefordshire, Horton made his debut against Derbyshire in July 1934, but made only 5 and 0 and was not selected again that season. The following year he played nine times, but again met with little success: in 14 innings he made only 76 runs, his highest score a mere 13. He did take 2–3 against Derbyshire (including the wicket of George Pope), but otherwise there was little for Horton to enjoy about his 1935 performances.
Horton played 21 matches in 1936, the most of any summer of his career, and his batting improved somewhat: he made 432 runs at 14.89 including two half-centuries, and his 59 against Gloucestershire came as part of an important ninth-wicket partnership of 80 with Reg Perks after Worcestershire had fallen to 139/8. Horton also picked up two wickets that season, the last he was to take.
For the next two years Horton continued to command a semi-regular place in the side, playing 13 times in 1937 and 18 in 1938, but with a couple of exceptions — such as his 70 against Glamorgan in the latter year — he was unable to produce good enough batting form to make a real claim to a permanent position, and he left first-class cricket without ever having scored 500 runs in a season.
Horton appeared for the Worcestershire second team in minor counties cricket in 1950. He died in Worcester at the age of 83.
His younger brother Henry, who predeceased him by just four days, played a few times for Worcestershire in the 1940s, but had a much more substantial career with Hampshire in the Fifties and Sixties.

It was serialized by Akita Shoten in "Young Champion" from 2000 to 2005, and later combined into 15 volumes, which were released in English by Tokyopop from 2003 to 2006. In October 2007, a special edition of the manga began being released.
The manga follows the plot of the novel fairly closely, but expands on the backstory of each of the students. Much like the plots of the novel and film adaptation, the manga is noted for its intense and gory violence. The Tokyopop English adaptation of the manga makes several changes to the plot, such as claiming that "[The] Program" is a reality TV show and changing the time setting of the story by almost 10 years; both changes are contradicted in later volumes.
Development.
Writing style.
At first the creators of the original version of the "Battle Royale" manga kept the story close to the original Japanese novel. As publication increased, Taguchi took increasing liberties with the story. Takami said that he looked forward to new installments of Taguchi's story and Taguchi said that he more strongly cared about the characters. Takami liked how Taguchi distributed the time among characters; Takami said that in the manga the characters changed and grew as the story progressed, unlike in the original novel. Taguchi said that in the manga version he modeled most of Takami's characters after people he personally knew. Takami describes Taguchi's stance as closer to his own than the stance of Kinji Fukasaku, the director of the film. Takami describes the manga as containing the feeling of "a general, nonjudgmental love for humans".
Art style.
Taguchi said that many people describe his art style as "reminiscent of , or that it's realistic". Taguchi disagrees with the descriptions, instead characterizing faces in his works as "manga faces" since he feels that it is "really easy to put my own emotions into the faces". Taguchi said that when he shows sadness in characters, he locates the characters' eyebrows "down as far as possible". Takami describes Taguchi's art as "directly descended from Osamu Tezuka" and "manga-esque". Takami described the style as "easy to overlook" because the art contains "clean lines". Takami believed that the art style fit the "Battle Royale" story. In the beginning Taguchi said that he felt that all of the characters had to "look like middle school students". Taguchi said that as the story progressed for many of the characters he began to draw them "more naturally" and add "specific expressions for certain things they would say". Takami describes the newer style as "more grown-up looking".
English-language adaptation.
An English-language release of the collected volumes, published in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom by Tokyopop was extensively rewritten by Keith Giffen, whose script does not completely follow the original manga.
Their adaptation mentions several dates that change the time the story is set in by almost 10 years. It uses the line "in the near future", but on Shogo Kawada's profile, it references the 2005 "program"; he says his last program was a year ago, leading to the assumption that the manga sets the story in 2006. In volume one of the English-language version, Shinji Mimura and the news channel reporter mentions the 2007 record of three days, seven hours and twenty-two minutes. In volume 14, Kamon refers to the 2009 program. None of these dates are mentioned in the original Japanese version.
But the major difference between the Japanese and Tokyopop version is that Giffen rewrote the BR program as a reality TV show, rather than keeping it in tune with the BR act, which leaves plot holes through the manga, especially in volume 15. This can be partially attributed to the fact that when Tokyopop had released volume 1, the Japanese version was only up to volume 9 at that point, thereby not giving Tokyopop or Giffen ample material to prove that their rewrite would backfire.
According to Tokyopop editor Mark Paniccia, in the Newsarama article: 'For adapting the work, Giffen was given a tight Japanese-to-English translation of the story, but his assignment was by no means just to tweak a translation. "I told him to do what he felt he had to do", Paniccia said. "I told him to Giffenize it."'
To which Giffen responds: '"It's a good story that Takami is telling", Giffen said. "What I do is go in and make bad scenes that much worse. I loved the movie of "Battle Royale", and also love the manga. I just wanted to do it right. I wanted to do justice to it, and I knew I couldn't get away with doing a straight translation, because it would be horrifyingly bad."'
In April 2006, Tim Beedle, a former associate editor of the English version "Battle Royale", stated on the Tokyopop Messageboard the reasoning behind the decision to have a fairly loose adaptation:
'Prior to starting work on the first volume of "Battle Royale", its editor (Mark Paniccia, who has since left Tokyopop) made a decision to hire Keith Giffen, a well-known American comic book writer, to provide a much looser adaptation than usual. He made this decision for a variety of reasons, but two seemed to be more prominent than the rest. First, due to BR's extreme content and M rating, it was going to be a tough sell. (Some of the large chains refuse to carry M-rated books.) Hiring a known writer could help compensate for this by driving sales. Second, more than any other book we were publishing at the time, BR had the potential to find a crossover audience in the direct market among American comic book readers, who often are adverse to trying manga.'
The plot changes to turn the BR program into a reality show sponsored by the government held similarities to Suzanne Collins' 2008 novel "The Hunger Games". John Green pointed out that the premise of the novel is "nearly identical". Although Collins maintains that she "had never heard of that book until [her] book was turned in", "The New York Times" reports that "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff", but that "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently".
Tokyopop released an "Ultimate Edition" of "Battle Royale" which consisted of 5 omnibus novels, with each novel having over 600 pages. The first volume was released on December 15, 2007, and the fifth and last on February 10, 2009. The Ultimate Edition has bonus features that consist of color pages, character sketches, weapon details, and Q&amp;A's with the author, Koushun Takami.
Other adaptations.
Conrad Editora from Brazil began publishing a Portuguese version at the tail end of 2006. It follows the original 15-volume format, and does not adapt the Giffen "Reality Show" version (although the cover of the first edition mentions the reality show). It was cancelled after 12 volumes in 2007, but returned in 2011. Editorial Ivrea from Argentina published a Spanish version.
Chapters.
The following titles reflect the English-language version.
"Battle Royale II: Blitz Royale".
 was inspired by the film "". While the author of the original novel, Koushun Takami, is given the "original work" credit, the story and art are by Hitoshi Tomizawa.
Like the earlier Battle Royales, a class of middle school students are picked to compete in fights to the death on an island until there is only one left.
The manga follows the point of view of Girl #10 , an unlucky girl who fears that her class will be chosen to participate in "the program", a mysterious event that forces students to kill each other. Makoto attends Shikanotoride Junior High School.
After the encouragement of her best friend Itou Yamamoto and her mother she decides to face the chances. Her fears are supposedly put to rest when word spreads that all 50 Programs had already been executed in the year making them 100% unlikely to participate. Arriving at their field trip in one piece, Makoto begins to forward all her nervousness into getting a boy she likes: Nomura.
As the field trip kicks off, the girls sneak into one of the boys' rooms, specifically Nomura's. While Itou takes advantage of the smuggled Vodka Nomura breaks the ice between himself and Makoto by asking her out, however, their romance is cut short when a boy runs in alerting the presence of their teacher. The girls hide inside the sleeping bags of the other boys which Nomura takes the chance of to feel Makoto's breast. Right when they believe the coast is clear, they are assaulted by a group of Navy soldiers who begin to forcefully push the students around which involves Nomura getting the end of a gun smashed in his face.
The students are all held captive by the government, and brought to a room where a man in a military uniform, Hoshou Takagi, stands to address the students of the new Navy Exclusive version of the Program. While the students are recovering from the sudden announcement, the intoxicated Itou is grabbed by the hair and has her long locks forcefully shaved off. As Makoto rushes to her friends side she meets the end of a gun, and her father's talisman is ripped from her neck.
From this point the story becomes much darker, the students are sent to a non-aggressive defence school and forced to dispose of corpses. They are then gassed in a shower chamber, dressed in full military attire (complete with collar).
When given the chance to rebel against the government, Makoto declines causing Nomura to become aggravated calling her "Chicken Shit". However, when Boy #3 Mitsugu Kawasaki gets the same opportunity, he takes it but as he turns his gun to the soldier he becomes the first victim of the new program and has his collar detonated before all his classmates, killing him.
It is later revealed that Mitsugu is the brother of the winner from the first Battle Royale.
The volume ends with Makoto as the solo female survivor and solemnly swearing that she will not let another class experience what she and her class went through while watching another new generation of teenagers arrive on the island, implying that a new Program is about to begin.
"Battle Royale: Angels' Border".
"Battle Royale: Angels' Border" is written by Koushun Takami and illustrated by Mioko Ohnishi and Youhei Oguma (each drawing one chapter). Set within the continuity of the original "Battle Royale" novel, it contains two side stories about the girls that hole up in the lighthouse. The first episode follows the point of view of Haruka Tanizawa. The second one is devoted to Chisato Matsui and Shinji Mimura. It was published in "Young Champion" in 2011, and later combined into one volume on January 20, 2012. The single volume was published in North America by Viz Media on June 17, 2014.
In the first episode, Haruka reveals through narration that she had recently realized that she is a lesbian and has romantic feelings for her best friend, Yukie Utsumi. However, she did not have a chance to come out before her class was pulled into the Program, and she struggles with her feelings while she, Yukie, and the others are hiding in the lighthouse. She wants to be close to Yukie, but at the same time knows that Yukie has a crush on Shuya Nanahara, whom the girls rescue after his near-fatal escape from Kazuo Kiriyama. Haruka also admires Yukie for her leadership, as her friend keeps the group together by reminding them that they all share their hope.
Each chapter of the episode concludes with a flash-forward to the events that lead the girls to turn on each other and the tragedy that results. The episode concludes with the injured Haruka's final act of fatally wounding Satomi Noda, who had killed Chisato and Yukie. Haruka dies when Satomi returns fire a final time before crumpling dead on the floor.
The second episode is primarily told in a flashback to the previous school year. Chisato has a chance encounter with Shinji on the train back to Shiroiwa, and after an incident with a surly passenger, the two hop off the train early and spend time together. Shinji takes Chisato on an impromptu date, and the two get to know one another. However, they come to a shared realization that they should not associate too closely with one another. Shinji's uncle was killed by agents of the government for engaging in anti-government activities, and Chisato's older brother, while suspected and subsequently cleared of the same, committed suicide. Because of these family ties, Shinji and Chisato speculate that the authorities may accuse them of conspiring against the government if they spend too much time together, and so they keep apart while maintaining strong places in their hearts for each other.
Like the first episode, each chapter of the second episode concludes with events that lead to the deaths of Shinji and Chisato. The ending also provides an explanation for why Chisato steps toward the gun on the table when Satomi threatens her and the others; an act that went without explanation or elaboration in the novel. Chisato's intent is to take the gun and throw it out of a window in order to show Satomi that she is not a threat. Only after it is too late does Chisato realize her mistake; Satomi reads Chisato's movement as aggressive, and kills her. As Chisato dies, she apologizes to Shinji for her failure.
"Battle Royale: Enforcers".
"Battle Royale III: Enforcers" is written by Koushun Takami and illustrated by Yukai Asada. It began serialization in Akita Shoten's "Bessatsu Young Champion" magazine in February 2022. The series is also licensed in North America by Viz Media as "Battle Royale: Enforcers".
Legacy.
According to its director, Hwang Dong-hyuk, the 2021 South Korean television show "Squid Game" was influenced by the manga version of "Battle Royale".

Eastpak

Eastpak is an American worldwide lifestyle brand founded in Boston, Massachusetts, specializing in the design, development, manufacturing and worldwide marketing and distribution of a range of products including bags, backpacks, travel gear and accessories. In 1952, the company began as Eastern Canvas Products USA, Inc., producing bags and packs for the U.S. military before focusing on the consumer market in 1976 under the brand name Eastpak. It is part of the VF Corporation brand portfolio.
History.
Founding.
Eastpak was founded in 1952 by Bernard Godfrey of Newton, Mass, as Eastern Canvas Products USA Inc. He was later joined by his son, William, and a third partner, Monte Goldman, and began by specializing in safety equipment for the U.S. Army. However, the company's direction changed dramatically when Goldman's son, Mark Goldman, joined the company in 1976. He transformed the company's retail product line into a consumer brand and launched the first line-up of bags and packs at a sportswear trade fair in Chicago in 1977. Norman Jacobs joined the company in 1980 and, with partner Mark Goldman, claimed a market-leading share of the U.S. college market on the East Coast throughout most of the 1980s and early 1990s.
Brand evolution.
In 1985, Eastpak introduced bright colors and prints to the bag collections. The company became the first bag brand to offer a lifetime product warranty (for legal reasons, the warranty is limited to 30 years). The evolution towards a bolder, more original style was also matched in the mid-1980s by increasingly provocative advertising campaigns featuring, e.g., the controversial comic-book character Andy Capp. Eastpak entered the luggage market in 1999 with the first wheeled trolley produced for the consumer market. V.F. Corporation acquired the Eastpak in 2000, where it joined other brands such as JanSport, The North Face, Kipling, Lee, and Wrangler.
International expansion.
Eastpak's first export markets were in Asia, with early successes in Japan, Korea, Singapore, and the Philippines.
Eastpak was first introduced to the European market in 1986 by the Frenchman Kostia Belkin. He met with Mark Goldman and Norman Jacobs in Boston, who convinced him to start distributing Eastpak products in Europe. Belkin then expanded distribution throughout France, Switzerland, and other European countries from 1986 to 1995, a trend soon followed by other brands such as Airwalk and DCSHOES. Thirty-five years later, although distributed worldwide, France is the largest market for the Eastpak brand.
In 2021, Eastpak relaunched into the US market through their own e-commerce site. 
Products.
Eastpak’s product portfolio includes a wide range of shoulder bags, backpacks, duffel bags, travel gear and accessories. Available in a large range of styles, colors, prints, and fabrics.
Travel gear.
Eastpak was also the first company to produce wheeled luggage for the consumer market.
Since then, the company has significantly expanded its range of travel gear ranging from uncomplicated, single-volume holdalls to two and even four-wheeled trolleys with single or dual compartments, in a range of sizes from strict carry-on to standard carry-on and larger. Most styles integrate other design features such as adjustable shoulder straps, organizer pouches, laptop and multimedia sleeves, expansion zips and straps, “add-a-bag” loops and security lock rings.
Projects.
Designer collaborations.
In 2004, Eastpak partnered with Belgian fashion designer Walter Van Beirendonck. Since then, Eastpak has produced collections in collaboration with designers including Kris Van Assche, Christopher Shannon, Raf Simons and many others.

Geovany Soto

Geovany Soto (born January 20, 1983) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball catcher. He played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), most prominently as a member of the Chicago Cubs, where he appeared in the MLB All-Star Game and was named the National League Rookie of the Year in 2008. He also played for the Texas Rangers, the Oakland Athletics, the Los Angeles Angels and the Chicago White Sox.
Professional career.
Chicago Cubs.
Selected by the Chicago Cubs 318th overall in the 11th round of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft, Soto made his major league debut on September 23, 2005, against the Houston Astros. He was recalled by the Cubs on July 12, 2007, but only had 1 hit in 7 at-bats. In September 2007, when the Cubs expanded their roster, he joined the team again. This was mainly because, in the minor leagues that year, he batted .353 with 26 home runs and 109 RBI and was named the Pacific Coast League's MVP while playing for the Iowa Cubs. After his call-up in September, Soto had an average of .389. Soto started for the Cubs during the 2007 playoff series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In game 2 of the series, Soto hit a home run into the left field bleachers at Chase Field, giving the Cubs an early 2–0 lead. The Cubs ended up losing that game, but it further solidified him as the Cubs' full-time catcher going into 2008, with Jason Kendall moving on to Milwaukee as a free agent.
2008.
Arguably the best offensive performance in Soto's career came April 30, 2008, in a rout against the Brewers. Soto hit two 3-run homers to account for 6 of the Cubs' 19 RBIs, only a few days removed from a two-game stretch against the Nationals in which he struck out in 8 consecutive at-bats. Soto was voted the National League Rookie of the Month for April 2008 after hitting .341 with 5 home runs, 8 doubles, and 20 RBIs, with an OPS of 1.059. On May 19, 2008, he scored his first career Inside-the-park home run against the Houston Astros. Soto led the early stage of the voting process for the National League's catcher in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He was selected to be the National League's starting catcher in the game. Soto became the first rookie catcher ever to start on the National League All-Star team. Soto is the first Cubs' All-Star rookie to play in the game with at least 14 home runs since Rafael Palmeiro did it in 1987, surpassing the mark when he hit his 15th home run on July 6, 2008. He went 3 for 5 with 7 RBIs in a game on August 26 against the Pittsburgh Pirates.
As a rookie catcher, Soto called a no-hitter game from behind the plate to pitcher Carlos Zambrano in a game against the Houston Astros on September 14, 2008. Played at Miller Park in Milwaukee due to Hurricane Ike moving through Houston, this was the first no-hitter in major league history pitched at a neutral site.
After the 2008 season, Soto was honored with the Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award and the Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award for the National League. Soto posted a .285 batting average, along with 23 home runs and 86 RBI's. Soto won the award in a landslide, receiving 31 of 32 first place votes. Soto is the first Cubs' backstop to play for multiple Cub playoff teams since Gabby Hartnett, and is the first to start playoff games in consecutive years since Johnny Kling. Soto also won the Pedrín Zorrilla Award, receiving unanimous support during the voting process. Orlando Cepeda was contacted to present the award, traveling to Puerto Rico for the ceremony.
2009–2011.
Soto was unable to live up to huge expectations in 2009, only posting a .218 batting average and 47 RBI. In June 2009, Soto was revealed to have tested positive for marijuana at the World Baseball Classic. While the MLB did not take any disciplinary actions, the International Baseball Federation banned him from playing internationally for two years.
In 2010, Soto batted .280 with 17 home runs. In 2011, Soto batted .228 with 17 home runs. He led major league catchers in errors committed, with 13, and had the lowest fielding percentage, at .987.
Texas Rangers.
On July 30, 2012, Soto was traded to the Texas Rangers for right-handed pitcher Jake Brigham. In 47 games with Texas in 2012, he hit .196 with 5 home runs and 25 RBI.
Soto spent 2013 as the backup catcher to A. J. Pierzynski. On June 4, 2013, Soto played his first career game at third base. On July 29, Soto hit a home run to win a game against the Angels. The Rangers entered the bottom of the ninth down by 1 before Pierzynski, the designated hitter, hit a solo home run to tie the game. In 54 games in 2013, Soto hit .245/.328/.466 with 9 home runs and 22 RBI. On November 5, Soto signed a one-year, $3.05 million deal with incentives with the Rangers to be their primary catcher.
Due to injuries to his knee and foot, Soto was on the disabled list for the first half of the 2014 season. On July 9, 2014, Soto was arrested on a charge of marijuana possession.

Chicago White Sox (second stint).
Soto signed a minor league contract with the White Sox on January 6, 2017. Soto made the White Sox Opening Day roster. His contract also included a club option for the 2018 season. On April 6, Soto hit his first two home runs on the White Sox (three-run homer in the third inning and a solo home run in the seventh inning), his fourth career multi-home run game, his first since 2011 on the Chicago Cubs. He finished the game logging two hits, two runs, and four RBIs. On April 8, Soto hit a solo-home run in the sixth right after Matt Davidson hit a two-run homer. This was Soto's third of the season in four games. On April 13, Soto was placed on the 10-day disabled list because of an inflamed right elbow. On May 15, 2017, it was revealed that Soto would undergo surgery on his injured elbow for debridement, ruling him out for an additional three weeks. He elected free agency on November 2, 2017.

Miss You (Aaliyah song)

"Miss You" is a song recorded by American singer Aaliyah. Written by Johntá Austin, Ginuwine and Teddy Bishop in 1998, the song was initially recorded in 1999 for Aaliyah's eponymous third studio album (2001). However, it did not make the final cut for "Aaliyah" and remained unreleased until after Aaliyah's death in 2001. It was then included on the posthumous compilation album "I Care 4 U" (2002) and was released as its lead single on October 28, 2002, by Blackground Records and Universal Records.
Upon its release, "Miss You" received widespread acclaim from music critics. A commercial success, it peaked at number three on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, becoming Aaliyah's second highest-peaking single behind her number-one hit "Try Again" (2000), and atop the "Billboard" Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart. Internationally, it reached the top ten in Germany, and top 20 in Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Darren Grant and featured tributes from Aaliyah's friends and collaborators, including DMX, Missy Elliott, and Tank. It was nominated for Best R&amp;B Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. Rapper Jay-Z made a tribute to Aaliyah using the "Miss You" instrumental and chorus for its official remix, released in March 2003.
Writing and production.
Originally crafted for Ginuwine's second studio album "100% Ginuwine" (1999), "Miss You" was written by Ginuwine, Johntá Austin and Teddy Bishop in 1998, and was produced by Bishop. In 1999, while Aaliyah was recording her eponymous third studio album (2001) at the Manhattan Center Studios, she requested Austin and Bishop to play her a couple of tracks they had produced with other artists, including "Miss You", for which Ginuwine had already lent his vocals. Bishop later commented: "She was like, 'I want to cut this record' [...] She got on the phone, called him and said 'Hey I know you cut this record already, but I would love to cut it'." Ginuwine allowed her to cut her own version of it and the same night, Aaliyah re-recorded the whole song. Although she reportedly wanted to put the song out herself, her label Blackground Records felt it was not a "smash record", thus the song was left unused until after Aaliyah's death.
According to "Billboard", lyrically "The verses paint it as a clear breakup song, about being left by her college-bound high-school lover — but with a more ambiguous chorus full of heart-tugging lyrics (“It’s been too long and I’m lost without you/ What am I gonna do?”) and a bird-twittering background hook that sounds like the singer’s soul flying free, it’s a tearjerker anyway".
Composition.
Sheet music for the song shows the key of B major with a suggested tempo of "moderately slow hip-hop (with a half-time feel)" at 112 beats per minute in common 4/4 time.
Release.
"Miss You" was first made available on October 28, 2002, for streaming via AOL's program First Listen. Blackground Records and Universal Records serviced it to contemporary hit, rhythmic contemporary, urban contemporary and urban adult contemporary radio stations in the United States on November 12, as the lead single from "I Care 4 U". Jay-Z's remix of the song was serviced to urban contemporary radio on April 8, 2003, and was released as a CD single with the original version on April 29.
In August 2021, it was reported that Aaliyah's recorded work for Blackground (since rebranded as Blackground Records 2.0) would be re-released on physical, digital, and, for the first time ever, streaming services in a deal between the label and Empire Distribution. "I Care 4 U" and "Ultimate Aaliyah", both including "Miss You", were re-released on October 8.
Critical reception.
John Bush from AllMusic, while mentioning the song with "All I Need", said that they "don't have the edge of her classic Timbaland productions, but they stand up well — even when they're slotted next to the best songs of her career." Oliver VanDervoort from AXS said, "This is another song that is slow and yet has a great catchy beat". Michael Paoletta from "Billboard" praised "Miss You", calling it "yet another showcase of a talent that was taken too soon" and adding: "The singer's breathy alto floats over a sensual, bass-heavy track, courtesy of Teddy Bishop". Damien Scott from "Complex" felt that the song "is a masterstroke in lovelorn yearning with Aaliyah spilling tears over a lost love. It made sense, then, that it was one of her last tracks, as it summed up the way her family, friends, and fans felt upon her passing". James Poletti from "Dotmusic" described the song as "deep 'n' honeyed sweetness" and felt that Aaliyah "evokes shuddering sensuality in every syllable". Laura Passero from the "Hartford Courant" labeled the song as a "soft ballad that highlights her sultry voice." She also felt that the lyrics, "it's been so long and I'm lost without you" in a way speaks to her death. "Music Week" felt that with its growing radio airplay that "this will find a ready-made audience among the late singer's fanbase". "musicOMH" called "Miss You" the best new song from "I Care 4 U", as well as stating "poignant lyrics ... mix well with a thoughtful, reflective, laid back tune." Sal Cinquemani from "Slant Magazine" called the song "Aaliyah-lite".
Commercial performance.
In the United States, "Miss You" debuted at number 55 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 on November 30, 2002. It peaked at number three on the chart dated April 5, 2003, becoming Aaliyah's second highest-peaking single on the chart after the number-one "Try Again" (2000), and spent a total of 30 weeks on the chart. The song also peaked atop the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart on January 25, spending three weeks at the summit. On the 2003 year-end charts, "Miss You" was ranked eighth on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and third on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart. Six years after its release, on November 22, 2008, the song debuted and peaked at number 38 on the US Hot Ringtones. After the October 8, 2021 re-release of "I Care 4 U" and "Ultimate Aaliyah", "Miss You" debuted and peaked at number five on the US R&amp;B Digital Song Sales.

Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carre

Le Petit Théâtre Du Vieux Carré is a small professional theatre in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana.
Le Petit was founded in 1916, when a group of amateur theatre-lovers began putting on plays in the drawing room of one of the members.
The audiences of the Drawing Room Players grew, and the founders rented space on the second floor of 503 St. Ann in the lower Pontalba Buildings, for $17.50 per month. Irish playwright Lord Dunsany, visiting the city, formally launched the new playhouse. In 1922, the theatre bought the property for its present location at the corner of St. Peter and Chartres Streets. Three small shed-like buildings facing St. Peter Street were removed and the present theatre building was constructed in 1922. The structure incorporated a 1790s colonial building on the corner, which was renovated and helped inspire the style of the rest of the structure. Architect Richard Koch designed the theatre in authentic Spanish Colonial style.
The building complex holds a professionally equipped theater. The corner building, reconstructed in 1963, originally held reception rooms, offices, dressing rooms, and a smaller theater.
Le Petit is run by a Board of Governors, with productions staged by professional staff. Le Petit Theatre offers Equity and non-union contracts, and pays all performers and technicians. Many visiting artists are professionals in music, dance, TV, or other performing arts.
During its 95 years of operation, Le Petit has been recognized as one of the leading "little" or community theaters in the nation.
In March 2009, facing severe financial difficulties, Le Petit's board of governors voted to lay off the theatre's artistic director and staff, and appointed The Solomon Group, a New Orleans entertainment company, as interim manager. The board terminated the Solomon Group's management in October 2010, and in December 2010 announced that the rest of its 2010–11 season would be cancelled. The theatre has continued to provide a venue for fundraising efforts and outside productions. In May 2011 it was reported that the Dickie Brennan family of restaurants was negotiating to take space for a restaurant in the building, allowing the theatre to maintain its operations.
Reopening.
In June, 2011, 60 percent of the building was sold to New Orleans restaurateur Dickie Brennan in a deal that retired the theatre's $700,000 debt and paved the way for much needed renovations to the deteriorating building. Brennan opened Tableau, a Creole restaurant, in a portion of the building and shares space with the theatre, which retained ownership of the original stage, executive offices, dressing rooms, and an educational space.
In May, 2013, the theatre launched a revamped website, www.LePetitTheatre.com, appointed Cassie Worley its new executive director, and announced plans for a preseason or "lagniappe" production of Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron's "Love, Loss and What I Wore" in July and a regular season of plays opening September 6, with "Lombardi". The 2013-14 season also included: "Death of a Salesman", "Golda's Balcony", "Hair", and "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat".
In March, 2015, the theatre hired Maxwell Williams as the Artistic Director.
In December, 2017, the theatre hired Don-Scott Cooper as the Executive Director.

Nickelodeon Party Blast

Nickelodeon Party Blast is a party video game developed by English developer Data Design Interactive and published by Infogrames Interactive. "Party Blast" was released for Xbox, Windows, and GameCube in 2002. A PlayStation 2 version of the game was planned to be released, but it was cancelled for unknown reasons, though leftovers, such as a model of a DualShock 2 controller, can still be found in all versions of the game's files. The game features characters from Nicktoons, including "SpongeBob SquarePants", "Rugrats", "The Wild Thornberrys", "Rocket Power", "Invader Zim", and "The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius", with CatDog as the hosts.
Gameplay.
Players play as 8 different characters and play more than 20 stages and six different party modes. Player 1 can choose Blast, Replay, and Cup challenge (Players 2, 3, and 4 have a mode called "Party Play"). Each stage has different events although the last stage is almost opposite from the original stage when the player first starts. Every party game has each different Boss depending on 5 different events (or party modes) on which level. In "Food Fight", players throw food at each other to lose lives or points and neither person can be taken away. Squirt and Splash has players squirting each other and have the person with the highest score to survival wins. In Basketball, players have to make the most baskets in the game and perform tricks to earn more points.
The Pipe Challenge is the 2nd party mode where players put pipes together to create a pipeline to blast rockets, Rugrats dinosaurs, and more. The Racing mode is the 5th party event where players race each other and see who has the most coins and mess up with items and more. Clam bonus stages are bonus stages where each different stage lets players play 4 different games to win or lose. At the end, there is also a Gooze Squirter stage where you squirt goo to Nicktoon characters and the person who goozes the most is the winner of the game and then goes back to the main menu.
Development.
"Nickelodeon Party Blast" was first shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2002. During the showing, Data Design promised unlockable bonus levels, power-ups, and boss battles.
Reception.
The game received largely negative reviews, with most criticizing the game's controls, graphics and sound effects. Metacritic gave the Xbox version a 19 out of 100, indicating "overwhelming dislike," while "IGN" gave the Xbox version a 1.1 out of 10, writing, "With so many great franchises, this could've been a decent party game. Instead, what we're left with is a poor-looking, poor-sounding, and poor-playing game."

I Want You So Hard (Boy's Bad News)

"I Want You So Hard (Boy's Bad News)" is the first single from the Eagles of Death Metal's second studio album "Death By Sexy". The song and music video has Jack Black, Josh Homme and Dave Grohl (all in wigs) making guest appearances. The video was directed by Akiva Schaffer, who directs the SNL Digital Shorts on "Saturday Night Live", including the short "Lazy Sunday".

In 2008, the song appeared in the credits of the HBO series "True Blood", and was used in the video game "Gran Turismo 5" (2010).

Eddie Machen

Edward Mills "Eddie" Machen (June 15, 1932 – August 8, 1972) was an American professional boxer. He was one of six children of a rural mail carrier. Machen dropped out of high school and became an amateur boxer. However, after just three bouts he was arrested and convicted of armed robbery. After his release, he became a professional boxer, determined never to return to prison again. His 64-bout career began on March 22, 1955, and he went on to win his first 24 bouts. He was highly rated and fought most of the big names of his era and he defeated many of the important names of his period such as Bob Baker, Jerry Quarry, Niño Valdés, Joey Maxim, Willi Besmanoff, Tommy Jackson, Brian London, Howard King and Doug Jones (boxer)
Professional career.
Early career.
Machen often fought at Civic Auditorium or the Cow Palace in San Francisco. His first bout was with fellow first-timer Raul Flores, whom he knocked out in the first round. He had eleven fights in 1955 and the six-foot, 195-pounder won them all, ten by knockout or technical knockout. He had eight more wins in 1956 against better competition. In 1957, he won all five fights he had, including two over former light heavyweight champion Joey Maxim. The Maxim wins made him a ranked contender.
In April 1958, he met highly ranked Zora Folley and fought to a draw over 12 rounds. But he was then knocked out in one round by undefeated future heavyweight champion Ingemar Johansson, in September. After being caught flush by a big right hand Machen was floored three times, the last for some minutes.
On the comeback trail in 1959, Machen posted seven straight wins to return him to contention. In January 1960, he lost a decision to Folley at the Cow Palace. Later that year he met top contender and future champion, Sonny Liston, and although he lost by a clear 12-round unanimous decision, fought a sharp hit and move match that many believed was later studied by heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali. Liston was penalized three times for low blows in that match.
1961 began with two wins, then a very controversial loss to Harold Johnson by decision. Again, he came back with three very good wins, including a decision over undefeated Doug Jones. In 1962, Machen had two more wins before he had a draw with high-ranked big hitter Cleveland Williams in Houston in July 1962. In 1963 he resumed fighting and scored four straight knockouts to finish the year. He fought just twice in 1964, battling his personal issues. One was a win, the other a close 12-round loss to another former heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson in Sweden in July 1964.
Title shot and late career.
In 1965, Machen received his first world title shot when he and 6' 6" Ernie Terrell met for the vacated World Boxing Association title that had been stripped from Muhammad Ali. Terrell won the 15-round decision. In 1966 he lost a decision to German southpaw Karl Mildenberger in Germany, then lost a close split-decision to powerful slugger Manuel Ramos. But he closed that year with two wins, one particularly notable over future contender Jerry Quarry, which was Quarry's first defeat
Versus Joe Frazier.
In late 1966, Machen fought young future heavyweight champion Joe Frazier and lost in a tenth-round technical knockout. Downed in the first round, Machen continued to try to out-slug rather than out-box the relentless Frazier.
Retirement.
Machen retired in 1967 at age 35 following consecutive losses to Henry Clark, Boone Kirkman and Joe Frazier.
Health and death.
Machen was admitted to the Napa State Hospital in the fall of 1962 after threatening to commit suicide. Biographies state he suffered from clinical depression. He later filed for bankruptcy in 1966 and retired from boxing in 1967. His final record was 50-11-3, with 27 KOs.
Eddie Machen was found dead in San Francisco on August 8, 1972, apparently the result of a fall from a second story apartment window. He was 40 years old. It is not known if the cause of death was suicide, accident, or murder.

Piglet's Big Game

Disney's Piglet's Big Game (stylized as Piglet's Big Movie Game in North America) is a 2003 action-adventure game developed by French developer Doki Denki Studio. Intended towards younger audiences, the game is based on the Disney version of the "Winnie the Pooh" franchise. The game is loosely based on "Piglet's Big Movie", and centers around Piglet and how he tries to overcome his fears.
The GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance versions of the game feature seven levels which focus on Piglet entering his friends' dreams to help them with their problems. Enemies such as Heffalumps and Woozles can be encountered in certain locations and Piglet must pull a face to scare them away. The GameCube version received mixed or average reviews, while the Game Boy Advance version was given higher reviews; retrospective reviews of the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions have been more positive. A separate Windows game was also released, which was a point-and-click adventure game in which Piglet helps Rabbit make soup for their friends.
Years after the game's quiet initial release, the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions became a viral phenomenon online in 2024 when the game's music and gameplay were compared to the "Resident Evil" and "Silent Hill" franchises. Amid the newfound attention, the game's director Pascal Stradella confirmed that "Resident Evil" was an inspiration for the game.
Gameplay.
GameCube, PlayStation 2, and GBA versions.
The game features seven levels which focus on Piglet entering his friends' dreams to help them with their problems. Enemies such as Heffalumps, Woozles, scary trees, a talking door, and walking mirrors (who are only found in the GBA version) can be encountered in certain locations and Piglet must make use of Brave Faces (where he pulls a face) to scare them away. This can be done by completing a code shown at the bottom of the screen. Some enemies have abilities that can hinder Piglet's attempts to scare them. An enemy getting too close to Piglet will result in him getting scared. Should this happen, Piglet can find a Christopher Robin balloon to comfort him.

Several minigames are also playable, such as a painting minigame located at Eeyore's home; not only can players paint pictures on Eeyore's easel, but they can also paint pictures from Piglet's scrapbook.
Plot.
GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions.
The game starts with Piglet observing Pooh reaching for a beehive, Roo reaching for a ball that is caught in a tree, Owl trying to remember where his memory book is, Rabbit planting his carrots, Eeyore having his usual gloomy days, and Tigger painting his house to look like him. During this, Piglet is frightened by a shadowy monster called the Granosorus, but it disappears before his friends can see it. Christopher Robin tells him that it was part of his imagination and that he must overcome his fears. However, Piglet says that heroes are supposed to be big and brave, and since he is the opposite, he is convinced that he will never become a hero.
As Piglet sadly leaves the Hundred Acre-Wood, his friends start to fall asleep doing what Piglet saw them doing. At the same time, Piglet discovers a mysterious telescope which causes him to magically enter their dreams and begins to help them with their problems such as giving Pooh honey, helping Roo find his ball, searching for Owl's memory book, helping Eeyore find colors, helping Rabbit harvest his carrots, and finding Tigger's missing stripes. Along the way, he faces off against many kinds of Heffalumps, Woozles, living trees, and a sentient door.
After helping them all, the Hundred Acre Wood gets flooded and Piglet attempts to save his friends, who are trapped on islands with Heffalumps and Woozles. Once Piglet rescues everyone, the Granosorus appears, but Piglet is able to scare it off. Christopher Robin comes and after learning of Piglet's bravery and heroism, he gives everybody a picnic to celebrate.
Game Boy Advance version.
After having a nightmare involving a monster called the Granosorus, Piglet runs towards his friends warning them of the monster before Christopher Robin calms him down. He explains that the nightmares can teach him how to be brave, so Piglet leaves to find out how to do so while his friends begin to fall asleep. Piglet discovers several dream portals, allowing him to enter their dreams and help them find their possessions and battles Heffalumps, Woozles, sentient mirrors, and living trees; the talking door also appears in this version. Every dream from the console version of the game is present in this game except Owl's and Tigger's. After helping everyone, a flood covers the woods, forcing Piglet to face his fears rescue his friends while dealing with many enemies, and eventually the Granosorus. Once everyone is rescued and the Granosorus is scared away, Christopher Robin arrives and after finding out that Piglet has faced his fears, he gives everyone a picnic to celebrate Piglet's bravery.
Microsoft Windows version.
In the Windows version, Piglet pays a visit to Rabbit's house, where Rabbit is busy making soup for his friends. He decides to help collect the soup ingredients from his friends to help Rabbit finish it. The ingredients list consists of honey, thistles, milk, pepper, haycorns, and a random vegetable from Rabbit's garden; Pooh was supposed to bring the honey, Eeyore was supposed to bring the thistles, Kanga and Roo were supposed to bring the milk, and Owl was supposed to bring the pepper, but none of them have come back with the ingredients. After Piglet brings all the ingredients to Rabbit, everyone (except Kanga and Roo) arrives for the party, so Rabbit leaves Piglet in charge of preparing the soup. Once the soup is finished and ready, everybody gathers at a picnic table to eat, where they thank Piglet for his help.
Reception.
The GameCube version received "mixed or average" reviews according to Metacritic. Ryan Davis, in a review for GameSpot, deemed the game very much superior to most children's games and movie tie-ins, and praised the voice acting, sound and art design (which features "surreal" imagery of the character's dream worlds). Davis also noted the game's gentle pace.
IGN's Chadd Chambers gave both the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions a 7.0/10, finding the gameplay simple but well-executed and easy to control and the battle system well-suited for the young target audience due to its lack of violence. He compared the graphics positively to the look of the cartoon and praised the "quite enjoyable" art direction, the real-time shadows, and the quality of the cut-scenes. The Game Boy Advance version was given a 6.5/10, writing, "This surreal, wonderfully produced game is perfect for youngsters."
Retrospective reviews of the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions, made after the game's renewed interest in 2024, have been more positive. TheGamer commented that the game "reminds us of what gaming has lost", saying that "smaller, more creative games can save us."
Legacy.
21 years after the game's quiet initial release, the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions became a viral phenomenon online in November 2024, after a user on X (Twitter) shared a video that went viral showcasing the game's soundtrack and gameplay, and several YouTubers and social media influencers including Vinny Vinesauce compared the game's music, gameplay and visuals to the "Resident Evil" and "Silent Hill" survival horror franchises. One key composition that was highlighted was an eerie-sounding track, titled by its file name as "SMIS_103_01_3C", popularly given the name "Foreboding 1" on YouTube (as the in-game music does not have official titles), which uses a sample from the same sample pack that was used in a track in the 2024 remake of "Silent Hill 2".
Interest in the game also spiked on eBay, with physical copies selling for as much as US$300. As of November 11, 2024, the PS2 and GameCube editions were selling for up to $1,200 on some online stores. Amid the newfound attention, the game's director, Pascal Stradella, who worked on the now-defunct Doki Denki Studio, has come forward sharing pages of the game's design document and concept art on social media, and confirmed that "Resident Evil" was an inspiration for the game, as well as "Luigi's Mansion". He called it a "kind of cartoon "Resident Evil" dealt with in a comic way."

Everything! (Tones on Tail album)

Everything! is a compilation album by British post-punk band Tones on Tail, released in 1998 as a double CD.
The first disc features the original "Pop" album, while the second disc collects the "Burning Skies" and "Tones on Tail" EPs, along with the "There's Only One!", "Performance", "Lions" and "Christian Says" singles. The order of songs "When You're Smiling" and "You, the Night and the Music" was reversed on this compilation. Included as a bonus was a live performance of Elvis Presley's "Heartbreak Hotel" (the only officially released Tones on Tail live recording), followed by a radio interview with Daniel Ash.
A handful of alternate mixes were not released as part of this collection: the radio edits of "Go!" and "Burning Skies", as well as an extended mix of "Twist", were released on the promo EP "Something!".
"Copper" was originally designated as playable at either 45 or RPM, as it was originally released on vinyl; the 45 RPM version of the song is included in this set.
Reception.
Writing for AllMusic, critic Ned Raggett said that the need for a complete compilation of Tones on Tail work "was long overdue". Describing the group's underground hit "Go!", he said: "It remains a wonderful, atypical dancefloor smash, with Ash's loopy 'ya-ya' chorus, Haskins' nutty percussion patterns, Campling's great fuzz bassline, and more all coming together in weird and fun ways".

EHF Women's Champions League

The EHF Women's Champions League is the competition for the top women's handball clubs in Europe, organised annually by the European Handball Federation (EHF). It is the most prestigious tournament for clubs, with the champions of Europe's top national leagues participating.
Tournament structure.
Each year, the EHF publishes a ranking list of its member federations. The first 27 nations are allowed to participate in the tournament with their national champion. The national federations are allowed to request extra places or upgrades from the EHF European League.
The EHF Champions League is divided into five stages. Depending on the ranking of their national federation and of the criteria list, teams can enter the competition in either qualification or the group phase.
The current playing system changed for the 2020–21 season.
Qualification tournament.
Groups of four teams are formed. The number of groups can vary each season. Teams from each group play semi-finals and finals, in a single venue over a weekend. The winning team from each group advance to the group phase, while teams from lower ranks continue in the EHF European League.
Tournament format.
Each year, the EHF publishes a ranking list of its member federations. The first nine nations are allowed to participate in the tournament with their national champion. In addition, the tenth spot is reserved for the best ranked national federation of the EHF European League. The national federations are allowed to request upgrades for their teams eligible to play in the EHF European League and based on the criteria list the EHF Executive Committee approves six upgrades.
The EHF Champions League is divided into four stages. All participating teams enter the competition in the group phase.
The current playing system has been introduced before the 2020–21 season.
Group phase.
Since the 2020–21 season, the format sees two groups formed, with eight teams each in Group A and B. All the teams in each group play each other twice, in home and away matches (14 rounds in total). The first two teams in Groups A and B advance directly to the quarter-finals, while teams from positions three to six in each of these groups proceed to the play off. The season is over for the last two teams in each group after the completion of the group phase.
Play off.
The pairings for the play off are decided by the placement of the teams at the end of the group phase (A6 vs B3, B6 vs A3, A5 vs B4 and B5 vs A4). Each pairing is decided via a home and away format, with the aggregate winners over the two legs advancing to the quarter-finals. The higher ranked teams in the group phase have the home right advantage in the second leg.
Quarter-finals
The pairings for the quarter-finals are also decided by the placement in the group phase (Winner of A5/B4 vs A1, Winner B5/A4 vs B1, Winner A6/B3 vs A2, Winner B6/A3 vs B2). The ties are decided through a home and away format, with the four winners over the two legs played in each pairing advancing to the EHF FINAL4. The higher ranked teams in the group phase have the home right advantage in the second leg.
EHF FINAL4
The participating EHF FINAL4 teams are paired for the semi-finals through a draw and play the last two matches of the season over a single weekend at one venue. The two semi-finals are played on a Saturday, with the third-place game and final on a Sunday.

Champion Aircraft

Champion Aircraft Corporation was an aircraft manufacturer founded by Robert "Bob" Brown that purchased the design for the Aeronca Champion, a light aircraft previously built by the Aeronca Aircraft Corporation, in 1954. Through the 1950s and the 1960s Champion introduced variations on the 7-series design. Champion also developed and began production of the significantly upgraded follow-on to the 7-series, the 8KCAB Decathlon, as well as the twin-engined Lancer. Champion was acquired in 1970 by Bellanca Aircraft Corporation, which continued to produce the Champion aircraft line at the former Champion plant.
Aircraft.
Champion was originally Flyers Service Inc., an aircraft maintenance company headed by Robert "Bob" Brown and located at Holman Field in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In 1954, the company purchased the type certificate for the Aeronca Champion design from Aeronca, and changed its name and realigned its focus to manufacturing the Champion line of aircraft. By the time Aeronca ceased production in 1951, they had advanced the design through the 7BCM, 7CCM, and 7DC, reaching the 7EC. It was this model with which Champion commenced production in 1954, giving it the name "Traveler" to go along with the alphanumeric model designation. (Champion assigned both alphanumeric designations and names to most of its designs.) Bob Brown subsequently relocated the production line to Osceola, Wisconsin, at the L.O. Simenstad Municipal Airport.
All aircraft Champion introduced were related to the original Aeronca design. Champion's aircraft, by date of Federal Aviation Administration approval or Champion introduction, are:
Champion was acquired in 1970 by Bellanca Aircraft Corporation, which continued to produce most of the Champion designs at the former Champion plant in Osceola. Soon after the acquisition, the plant burned down.

Robert Elliott Burns

Robert Elliott Burns (May 10, 1892 – June 5, 1955) was an American World War I veteran known for escaping from a Georgia chain gang and publishing the memoir, "I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!", exposing the cruelty and injustice of the chain gang system. His memoir and story was adapted into the similarly titled 1932 Oscar-nominated film "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang", which received nominations for Best Picture and Best Actor for star Paul Muni.
Life and career.
Robert Burns was born in 1892 in New York City. In 1912, he left his family and drifted throughout the United States as a laborer. Two days after the United States entered World War I on April 6, 1917, he enlisted in the U.S. Army as a combat medic. Burns was assigned to the 14th Engineer Battalion and was present for many of the United States' major engagements in World War I, including the Battle of Chateau-Thierry and the Battle of Saint-Mihiel. He was discharged at the rank of private.
Upon his return from Europe, he suffered deeply from what his brother, Vincent Burns, deemed "a typical shell-shock case". His deteriorating psychological condition, coupled with his inability to recover his pre-war job, or the wages he was earning, caused Burns to become a drifter again.
The chain gang.
In 1921, Burns found himself in Atlanta, Georgia. He was tricked into participating in a robbery of a grocery store, which netted the robbers only $5.81 (). Burns was convicted and sentenced to six to 10 years of hard labor on a Georgia chain gang. In 1921, since Georgia did not have a state prison, Burns was sentenced to a different kind of incarceration: convict leasing. As a member of Georgia's convict lease system, Burns was forced to complete back-breaking labor for the profit of the state. He endured the most inhumane of conditions as a convict lease laborer: endless labor, inadequate shelter, constant beatings, and insufficient food.
Burns escaped from the chain gang with the help of another inmate, who struck his restraints with a sledgehammer, bending and weakening them. He evaded the guards while they thought he was taking his five-minute rest. Burns made his way to Chicago, where he eventually became the editor and publisher of "Greater Chicago Magazine." In this magazine, he published articles about his life as a member of a Georgia chain gang and the brutality he endured. During his stay in Chicago, he became involved with a divorcee named Emily Del Pino Pacheco, from whom he rented a room. She supported Burns in his real estate plans and helped him set up his magazine with her savings. They married in 1926. 
Three years later, he sought a divorce in order to marry Lillian Salo. The 22-year-old woman was 16 years his junior. His wife sued for divorce. Within a month Burns was apprehended, pending extradition back to Georgia. Burns claimed that his wife had been responsible for the anonymous letter that tipped off authorities there, but she denied it. Owing to his status in the community, many people helped him fight extradition to Georgia. In spite of this help and much support from all around the country, the ruling went against him.
Second imprisonment.
Burns returned to Georgia in June 1929 to finish his prison term. After initially serving in Campbell County Camp, where he was given relatively light work as a painter, he was transferred to Troup County Prison Camp. He was assigned to road work, which was much tougher. He did not qualify to apply for parole until a year after his return. After several failures to gain approval for parole, on September 4, 1930, Burns again escaped. He waited until he had earned the guards' trust and could obtain the privilege of not being chained. He paid off a local farmer with money he had received from his brother living in Newark, and headed to New Jersey.
Burns could not duplicate his Chicago success in New Jersey, due to the Great Depression. He took on odd jobs around the state for a few years, all the while writing his memoir, "I am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!" It was serialized in 1931 and published as a book in 1932. Movie rights had already been purchased and the book adapted for a movie of nearly the same name.
Fame and freedom.
In January 1932, a cinematic version of Burns's memoir was released by Warner Bros. under the slightly altered title, "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang", starring Paul Muni. Burns was a consultant on the set of the film. According to a review in "The New York Times", the movie was "an exciting, thrilling tale" that "shocks and horrifies." 
The success of the movie led Burns to make more frequent public appearances condemning the use of chain gangs in the South. Burns's exposure resulted in his being arrested again, in Newark in December 1932. But, the governor of New Jersey refused to extradite him to Georgia, since his book and a movie had been released and public opinion was firmly against the idea. He also married Clara with whom he had four children.
In 1943, Burns met newly elected Georgia governor Ellis Arnall in New York and requested a pardon. Arnall had Burns return to Georgia in November 1945 to face the parole board, and stood by his side as his counsel. The board commuted Burns's sentence to time served.
Legacy.
Burns died in 1955, aged 63, at the East Orange Veterans' Hospital in East Orange, New Jersey, following a long illness, believed to be cancer.
Burns' book is considered part of a long American tradition of reform literature intended to spur the American public to opposition of an issue. Some examples of this literature are "Uncle Tom's Cabin", "The Jungle", and "The Other America". Burns's book and subsequent movie are largely credited with the abolition of the chain gang system in the South.
Media.
The book has been made into two movies:

RNZAF Dip Flat

RNZAF Dip Flat is the field training facility and mountain flying training area of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.
Located at the base of the Saint Arnaud Range at the eastern boundary of Nelson Lakes National Park in the South Island of New Zealand, on the banks of the Wairau River, Dip Flat serves to train recruits from CRTS (Command and Recruit Training Squadron) in "out-in-the-field" practical military training.
Recruits usually do a ten-day stint at Dip Flat as part of their Thirteen-week Basic Training. While there, they learn the basics of setting up camp, radio communication, obstacle courses, river crossings, land navigation, military patrols, night and daytime patrols and interdiction, camouflage training, rifle range exercises, and three days "on patrol" practical training away from Dip Flat to mark the end of the ten-day stint (a rough equivalent of the United States Marine Crucible).
New Zealand Cadet Forces cadets and officers also make use of Dip Flat in their annual week-long bush craft training camps which take place each January. Both Cadets and Officers achieve Mountain Safety Council qualifications as outdoor instructors.
RNZAF No. 3 Squadron regularly use Dip Flat for their mountain flying training. From time to time the Australian Army has also used the area to practice mountain flying in their UH-60 Blackhawks with the RNZAF. There is an annual training exercise named "Blackbird" for this and other helicopter squadrons.
Dip Flat was a stop on a stock driving track from the East to the West coast of the South Island. Dip Flat was one of the dipping stops on the route.
Dip Flat is also known as Dry Valley or Valley of the dry. Temperatures in the summer can be very hot, often exceeding 30 degrees Celsius with hot north west winds. The winters are extremely cold often with heavy snow, and temperatures fall well below zero degrees.
The area can receive huge amounts of heavy rainfall due to the close proximity of the Saint Arnaud Range, and many roads and fords become impassible.
Dip Flat has also been used for search and rescue training for the New Zealand Police.

Gerra (Verzasca)

Gerra (Verzasca) is a part of the municipality of Cugnasco-Gerra in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
Gerra was an independent municipality until January 1, 2009, when it merged with Cugnasco to form Cugnasco-Gerra.
Location.
It consisted of Gerra Piano and Agarone, exclaves in the Magadino Plain, and the main part (Gerra Valle) of the municipality in the Verzasca valley.
History.
Gerra is first mentioned in 1387 as "Giera". Until 1852, it was part of Brione. The exclaves were assigned to Gerra in 1920, when the scattered landholdings of Locarno, Minusio and Mergoscia in the Terricciole plains were separated from the cities. In 1742, the parish of Gerra was created when it separated from Brione. The church of San Giovanni Evangelista already existed in the 15th Century but was destroyed twice: in the late 16th Century by a landslide and 1817 by a flood. The present church dates to 1819. The Church of Sacro Cuore in Gerra Piano was built in 1930. In Gerra Valle there is a mill dating from the 16th century, and a house from 1470.
The inhabitants lived on agriculture and livestock. Since the 14th Century, there have been annual summer cattle drives to the Alpine pastures. They spent the winters in the Magadino or Sottoceneri valleys. Due to limited agricultural land, portions of the population has emigrated since the 17th Century. Between 1860 and 1874 about a quarter of the population emigrated. In the late 20th and early 21st Centuries the population rose due to the development of Gerra Piano to an important local center. However, in the valley the population has declined.
Historic population.

1954 Blons avalanches

The Blons avalanches took place in Austria in January 1954. They occurred in the federal state of Vorarlberg, where they had a big impact on the Great Walser Valley region and specifically, the village of Blons. The avalanches occurred over a two-day period beginning from 11 January 1954 and resulted in the death of 125 people, 57 of whom were killed specifically in Blons. Two big avalanches struck Blons within 9 hours, the second of which buried rescue workers who were attempting to save civilians from the first avalanche. The avalanches caused much destruction to the Blons village, damaging one third of housing infrastructure and killing one third of the population. The Blons avalanches are considered to be one of the worst mass burials in Austrian history, resulting in one of the highest number of fatalities due to an avalanche.
Geography.
The village of Blons is located in the Bludenz district in the federal state of Vorarlberg, located on the western side of Austria. On its western side, the state of Vorarlberg borders with the European country Liechtenstein. Bludenz is a mountainous region with 525 mountains. In Vorarlberg there are 1315 avalanche catchment zones. The starting points of the Blons avalanches were Falvkopf and Mont-Calv. These peaks are situated approximately 6,500 ft high and surround the village. Falvkopf is 1849 meters above sea level. The coordinates of the Blons avalanche locations are Latitude: 47.2160 Longitude: 9.8160. The area of Blons is surrounded by rocks which are easily susceptible to erosion.
The avalanches.
On 11 January 1954 at 9:36am, the first avalanche began, starting at Flavkopf, where it struck the Blons village at 10:00am. The first avalanche struck the eastern side of the village, burying 82 people and killing 34 people. A second avalanche began later that night at 7:00pm starting at Mont-Calv. The second avalanche struck the centre of the village of Blons where 43 people were buried and 22 people died. Sixteen people who were rescued from the first avalanche were also later buried in the second avalanche. Both avalanches were classified as catastrophic. An avalanche classified at a catastrophic level means it has the potential to damage the surrounding landscape, the runout can cause damage and destruction to infrastructure in a valley and is large in size. On the morning the avalanche occurred, the local radio announced the avalanche warning system cautioned "the danger of avalanches has become extremely serious and is still increasing." A survivor, Robert Dobner, recounts the day as "a dark Monday, so full of snow."
Rescue mission.
The rescue response to the Blons avalanches was slow due to damaged power and telephone lines, which delayed rescuers hearing the news of the avalanches a day later. The rescue mission to save victims trapped from these avalanches led to the first airlift in Austrian history. Airlifts can quickly provide equipment and resources needed for a rescue mission site including transceivers, shovels and probes. Rescue dogs can also be used as they use their sense of smell to search for humans. The first Austrian responders started a rescue mission on 13 January 1954 and countries such as Germany, Switzerland and the United States also contributed to help rescue the civilians. The US Air Force provided 99 helicopters and 11,000 kg of rescue supplies while The Swiss Air-Rescue sent 14 rescuers, 6 rescue dogs, 2 helicopters, doctors and 5 rescue paratroopers. One of the main causes of death for victims impacted and trapped from an avalanche is asphyxia, which means people can still be alive while buried for a period of time and have the potential to survive. Some survivors of the Blons avalanches had been trapped for up to 17 to 62 hours. A "Sydney Morning Herald" article that reported on the Blons avalanches described the rescue crews as having to face a deep and narrow valley covered on both sides by tons of snow and that every capable man contribution to help. It also recounts that flares were used to help the rescue workers as the avalanches damaged lights as well as cutting off water supply and roads and rail communication.
Aftermath.
The aftermath of the Blons avalanches resulted in "270 burials resulting in 125 deaths, 55 houses and hundreds of farm buildings [were] destroyed, and 500 cattle were killed." The population of Blons in 1954 had a total of 376 people and a third (111 people) were killed outright by the avalanches. Half of the men who worked at the Leduc mine in the area were also killed (Ruth, 1998; Davis, 2008). A third of the housing was also destroyed with 29 out of 90 homes in the village listed as demolished. Thirty-three victims were able to get to safety by themselves, 31 were rescued by rescue teams and 47 were found dead. One woman who was cooking in her home at the time the avalanche struck died from burns from coals in her oven that hit her on impact. Another man who had been found alive by a rescue crew after 17 hours, later died of shock after finding out how long he had been buried in the snow, as reported by wire service reports. Of the civilians found alive, 8 later died and 2 were not found.
Cause.
Austrian alps are always susceptible to natural hazards such as avalanches. In the lead up to the avalanches that targeted Blons, a combination of cold weather and a rapid increase in snowfall could not be sustained and was too much to hold. The heavy snowfall resulted in more than 2 meters in depth of snow in less than 24 hours. According to Holler (2009), two days prior to the first avalanche in the winter of January 1954, a "north westerly oriented frontal zone led to high new snow depth" particularly in Vorarlberg. Following the heavy snowfall, temperatures started to rise. After layers of snow accumulate and temperatures rise, snow cohesion can deteriorate and can cause an avalanche to release.
Prior to January 1954, the protection measures against avalanches in Blons were first established between 1906 and 1908. This included support structures of snow fences and walls of approximately 2 – 2.5 meters, which were destroyed during the 1954 avalanches and said to be inadequate. In the mountains above Blons the trees were also spread out resulting in low forest cover and therefore reduced protection coverage for the village. The civilians in the Blons village also took precautions to avoid the risk of an avalanche to surrounding areas. As winter approached, councilmen in Blons would remove a crucifix that was placed in a high-risk area to avoid any damage to it. At a particular ravine in Blons, the civilians would stop talking and walk in a single line spread apart when crossing a bridge. This was done to avoid their voices causing vibrations in the area that could start an avalanche and if one was to release, they believed being spread apart would reduce the number of them taken by it.
Response.
The Blons avalanches in Austria in 1954 have "heralded modern avalanche protection in the alps." Due to the high impact of these avalanches, along with others in Austria, measures have been put in place to protect the Blons village in Vorarlberg from potential avalanche threat in the future.‘Catastrophic’ level avalanches have since decreased in Austria due to improved protection measures overall.
Comprehensive investigation into forest cover and tree quality has been undertaken in the mountains above Blons in order to improve its effectiveness in protection against avalanches. The ‘Forest Engineering Service for Torrent and Avalanche Control’ is in charge of enforcing protection measures against natural hazards in Austria. Since the Blons avalanches, there is much more forest cover compared to the coverage in 1954, due to extensive reforestation efforts. In 1971 there was 520 hectares of forest coverage and by 2009 it had increased to 601 hectares of coverage. Forest coverage can help improve protection against avalanches as it can slow down the speed of the snow and reduce the runout distance. In the Blons area approximately half a million trees have been planted, four fifths of which are Picea abies. This abies tree species is effective in avalanche protection due its capability in ensuring stabilisation because of its deep root system that can reach a depth of up to 2 metres. At the main starting points of avalanches in Blons, approximately 6.5 kilometres of defence mechanisms have since been put in place including steel snow bridges, hangings and steel-wood construction as well as 315 creeping snow constructions and 745 metres worth of wind drift barriers.
Studies of the Blons avalanches have helped to improve the knowledge and understanding of avalanche cycles in Austria, which in turn have helped result in more efficient forecasting of avalanches. A study has revealed that of the biggest avalanches in Austrian history "about two-thirds [of the avalanches] occurred as a result of a north-westerly oriented frontal zone." It also found that higher levels of snowfall played a large contributing role in the cause of these ‘catastrophic’ avalanches. The study was able to deduce that certain weather situations are related to the avalanche cycles and patterns occurring in Austria and has helped better predict when an avalanche might be expected. Avalanche warning systems are also now available online. The ‘European Avalanche Warning Services’ aims to provide "society with efficient and effective avalanche forecasting and warning services" and can inform and warn people of any potential avalanche risks in areas all across Europe, including Blons. Avalanche detection has been developed which looks at features such as infrasound, seismic and radar signals. Modern avalanche simulation technology has also been made, which makes it possible to simulate potential hazardous scenarios in high risk avalanche hazard-zones and detect where there may be protection measures against avalanches. In regard to the Blons avalanches, this technology was able to help highlight the lack of defensive constructions at the starting points of each of the avalanches that released.
In terms of avalanche rescue strategies, there has been little change since the Blons avalanches. Approximately 50% of people do not carry avalanche transceivers. If they were to be buried by an avalanche original tools and strategies are still in use to rescue buried victims.
In the Media.
Several books and films have been produced which have recounted the experience of those involved. The book titled "Avalanche!" written by author Joseph Wechsberg in 1958 provides coverage on the events of the Blons avalanches, civilians stories, the impact it had on the whole community and the rehabilitation efforts the community has adopted. He describes the events as "no other recorded avalanche in modern history has done so much to so many in so short a time and so small a place." The film and novel called "Der Atem des Himmels" is also based on the 1954 avalanches in Blons. It depicts the build-up and how the events of the avalanches unfolded. The incident of the avalanches is also featured in the documentary series "Disasters of the Century" in season 4, episode 9 which includes personal recounts from residents of Blons at the time, what they experienced as well as reenactments. An avalanche documentation centre in Blons exhibits facts and photographs about the events that occurred during the 1954 avalanches and what protection measures have been put in place to increase safety to the area.

Contone

Contone is a former municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
On 25 April 2010, the former municipalities of Caviano, Contone, Gerra Gambarogno, Indemini, Magadino, Piazzogna, San Nazzaro, Sant'Abbondio and Vira Gambarogno merged in the new municipality of Gambarogno.
History.
Contone is first mentioned in 1152 as "Gondono". However, three tombs have been discovered in Contone, which can be dated earlier than the Early Middle Ages. These tombs date to the reopening of the alpine passes.
Some time before 1219, a Hospital of the Knights Hospitaller was built in the village. However, the exact foundation year and location are controversial. It was later Commandry of the Order of Malta. In the 16th century, the Commandry estates went to the hospital in Lugano and in 1811 to the Antognini family of Bellinzona.
In 1104, the Lombard nobleman Wido Samarate built or rebuilt a church and presented it to the Benedictine monastery of S. Giorgio in Quartino. The church, which was dedicated to St. Nicholas, was incorporated in 1152 into the parish of Locarno. It was closed in 1769 and fell apart. The parish church of S. Giovanni Battista was built in the 16th century church, on the site of the hospital church.
The inhabitants of Contone lived as herders and farmers, mostly on the lowest part of the slope of Mount Ceneri. After 1850, the employment situation changed because of the decline of the port of Magadino and railway construction. Many inhabitants emigrated abroad and found work as painters, plasterers and stove-makers. With immigration of, mainly Italian, day laborers, the population began to grow. At the end of the 20th century most jobs were in the services sector. After the correction of the Ticino river, the vast, formerly marshy plain became home to a number of commercial and industrial buildings.
Geography.

Clem Coetzee

Clem Coetsee (c. 1939 – 7 September 2006) was a Rhodesian conservationist. He developed new methods of big game conservation.
History.
Coetsee was at the forefront of the campaign to de-horn rhinos under sedation, to make them safe from poachers who kill for the horn.
He also pioneered the practice of managing elephant populations by sedating and moving entire family groups, from bulls and cows down to calves, in contrast to the practice of slaughtering the mature animals and relocating only youngsters. Moving family groups was seen as more successful in relocating the animals without ill effects, and has been repeated in several countries. In 1992 he had tracking microchips implanted under the skin of more than 40 elephants, which were being relocated from Zimbabwe's Gonarezhou National Park to South Africa because of drought. This was the first time an elephant relocation had used this technology for follow-up.
He died of a heart attack on the 4th of September 2006.

Gordola

Gordola () is a municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.
History.
Gordola is first mentioned in 1200 as "Gordora". In 1219, it was mentioned as "Gordolla/e". Gordola was located near major roads throughout its history. During the Middle Ages, the village was on the hills as the valley floor was covered in swamps. In the 11th–12th centuries, a castle was built on the shore of Lake Maggiore for the feudal lord appointed by the Bishop of Como. The castle had disappeared by the 14th century. The "Capitanei" of Locarno owned land and were landlords in Gordola.
Within the territory of Locarno, Gordola was the only "Vicinanza", which could choose its own pastor. It also held the right to designate a member of the parish council. Starting in the 14th century, many residents of the Verzasca valley traveled to Gordola to spend the winters at the lake. This gradually evolved into a traditional seasonal migration. Starting in 1695 Gordola was divided into two districts ("squadre"); those of the "original" and the "new" residents (Vicini). The two groups took turns administering the municipality.
The former parish church of SS Peter and Vincenzo was in Tenero and formed a kind of exclave, until 1898, when the provost was moved to the church of S. Antonio Abate. The church of S. Antonio Abate had existed since the 16th century, but was destroyed in 1829 by a flood and then was subsequently rebuilt. There was a mixed Humiliati order monastery (Santa Maria) in Gordola. It was founded in the 12th century and around the late 15th century closed.

Critical reception.
Jason Kane of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5, calling it The Third Eye Foundation's "most consistent" album to date. He added, "The percussion is meticulously constructed; each beat is placed for a purpose and new rhythms are exposed upon repeated listens." Kristen Sage Rockermann of "Pitchfork" gave the album a 5.8 out of 10, saying, "On "Little Lost Soul", Elliot has pointlessly sugared the pill with smoother production, and as a result, the album lacks the power of the dreamworlds its eerie textures allude to."

Texas Parks and Wildlife Department

The Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department (TPWD) is a Texas state agency that oversees and protects wildlife and their habitats. In addition, the agency is responsible for managing the state's parks and historical areas. Its mission is to manage and conserve the natural and cultural resources of Texas and to provide hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation opportunities for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations.
The agency maintains its headquarters at 4200 Smith School Road in Austin, Texas.
History.
In 1895, the Texas Legislature created the Fish and Oyster Commission to regulate fishing. The legislature added the Game Department to the commission in 1907. The Legislature created the State Parks Board as a separate entity in 1923. In 1963, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department was formed through merger of the State Parks Board and the Game and Fish Commission.
In 1983, the Texas legislature passed the Wildlife Conservation Act, giving the department the authority for managing fish and wildlife resources in all Texas counties. The department operates 95 state parks and historic sites, 51 wildlife management areas, eight fish hatcheries, and numerous field offices statewide.
On January 1, 2008, and September 1, 2019, TPWD transferred management of several historic sites to the Texas Historical Commission.
Budget and staff.
The agency employs more than 3,500 permanent employees, and 300 interns every summer, from every field of study. Intern programs vary but are typically 12 weeks long and go from May until August.
Game wardens and park police officers undergo a 30-week course at TPWD's Texas Game Warden Training Center in rural Hamilton County.
Organization.
The department is made up of 12 divisions:
Outreach.
Magazine.
TPWD publishes "Texas Parks and Wildlife", a monthly magazine available both in print and online editions. The magazine features articles and full-color photos on topics such as birding, boating, camping, fishing, hunting, state parks, travel, wildlife, and environmental issues. "Texas Parks and Wildlife" has been in publication since 1942.
Television programs.
"Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife" is a weekly, half-hour television series aired on Texas PBS stations, as well as on a number of other PBS stations around the country. Viewers can stream episodes on the PBS website and on the TPWD YouTube channel. Originally titled "Made in Texas", the series began production in 1985 as a magazine style show, with three or four different segments each week. For several years, the show focused on one topic each week, documentary style. In 1991, the name of the series changed to "Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife" and reverted to its original magazine format.
Beginning in June 2016, TPWD Game Wardens were featured in a new reality television series on Animal Planet titled Lone Star Law.
Radio program and podcast.
"Passport to Texas" is a daily series broadcast on radio stations throughout Texas. The series includes 90 second radio spots on topics, including wildlife, state parks, and outdoor activities.
"Under the Texas Sky" features outdoor experiences of both everyday people and experts from inside and outside TPWD. 
Texas Parks and Wildlife Foundation.
Founded in 1991, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Foundation is the nonprofit funding partner of TPWD. Overseen by a board of trustees and administered by full- and part-time staff members, the foundation has raised over $205 million since its inception to ensure all Texans can enjoy, explore, and be inspired by the wild things and wild places in Texas.

Sen Katayama

, born , was an early Japanese Marxist political activist and journalist, one of the original members of the American Communist Party and co-founder, in 1922, of the Japanese Communist Party. After 1884, he spent most of his life abroad, especially in the United States and the Soviet Union, where he was very active in the international socialist community, and after 1920, the communist community. Katayama had a weak base inside Japan, and was little known there. However, in the rest of the world, he was widely hailed as a leading spokesman for the Japanese socialist and communist movements.
Early life and education.
Sugataro Yabuki was the second son born to Kunizo and Kichi Yabuki in 1859 in the Hadeki district of what would later become Japan's Okayama Prefecture. He was adopted by the Katayama family at nineteen and took the name Sen Katayama, becoming the Katayamas' "first son" after his birth mother was deserted by her husband. The adoption avoided Katayama's conscription and allowed him to continue his education. In his autobiography, , Katayama admitted that he was fortunate not to have been the first born in his birth family, as it saved him from some of the responsibilities that burdened some of his acquaintances.
In 1878, Katayama travelled to Tokyo to apprentice as a printer while studying at a small preparatory school, the Oka-Juku, where he formed a friendship with , nephew of one of the founders of Mitsubishi. Iwasaki's departure for Yale University inspired Katayama to work his way to the United States, where he attended Maryville College in Maryville, Tennessee and Grinnell College, from which he graduated in 1892, proceeding to the Andover Theological Seminary and then to Yale Divinity School. During this period, Katayama became a Christian and a socialist.
Career.
Katayama returned to Japan in 1896 and from 1897 to 1901 edited , the organ of the and .
Katayama was a founding member of the Social Democratic Party, Japan's first socialist party, in 1901, but was forced to disband by the government one day later. He returned to America in 1903 at the urging of Iwasaki to look into rice-farming opportunities. During this trip he attended the Second International Socialist Congress in Amsterdam where he gained recognition for shaking hands with the Russian delegate, G. V. Plekhanov, in a gesture of amity between the Russian and Japanese peoples, despite the then-ongoing Russo-Japanese War. 
In 1904, he attended an American Socialist Party convention in Chicago. He settled in Texas and his main business became rice farming. When his crop failed he became employed by a Japanese restaurant owner in Houston, Tsunekichi Okasaki, who bought of land in Texas with the plan that Katayama farm it. In late 1905, the two borrowed $100,000 from Iwasaki to fund the rice harvest, together forming a "Nippon Kono Kabushiki-gaisha" (Japan Farming Company) to develop the project, with Katayama as managing director. However, the company quickly dissolved, reputedly over Katayama's socialist leanings, and he returned to Japan in 1907, rejoined the socialist movement, and pursued a career in journalism.
He was arrested and jailed for his participation in the Tokyo Streetcar Strike of 1912, and after his release he left for California. Attracted by the success of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917–1918, Katayama became an active communist and an officer for the Communist International. He travelled to Mexico and later to Moscow, where he was hailed as a leader of the Japanese communist movement. He remained in the Soviet Union until his death on November 5, 1933, and his ashes buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Red Square.
Personal life.
Katayama had two children by his first wife, Fude, who died in 1903, and another daughter by his second wife, Hari Tama, whom he married in 1907.

New Point Comfort

New Point Comfort is a point of land located in Mathews County at the tip of Virginia's Middle Peninsula in the lower Chesapeake Bay in the United States. It is the site of the New Point Comfort Natural Area Preserve and the New Point Comfort Light.
Geography.
The tip New Point Comfort is now on an island separated from the mainland of Mathews County south of the unincorporated town of Bavon at the mouth of Mobjack Bay. It is north of Old Point Comfort in Phoebus, Hampton. The peninsula to the north of the point, from Peppers Creek and Horn Harbor southward, is also called New Point Comfort.
History.
English explorer John Smith passed by New Point Comfort in 1608 when returning to Jamestown from the northern Chesapeake Bay. The New Point Comfort Light was built from 1802–1805 and by 1852, it was partially cut off by the sea and formed a new island. In 1904, the New Point Comfort Development Company was formed to build a resort on the peninsula by reclaiming the marsh that separated the lighthouse from the mainland and building beaches. However, the prohibitive cost doomed the project and the business went bankrupt. In 1933, the Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane and the Outer Banks Hurricane definitively severed the lighthouse from the mainland and it now is about from shore on a small riprap island.

Kinoton HDFS (High Definition Film System) was a prototype 35 mm motion picture film format proposed by German projector company Kinoton and developed with the film camera company ARRI and the Swiss company Studer. The format was developed between 1988 and 1990. It proposed removing the optical soundtrack from film prints, and using the SMPTE 80 bit timecode printed onto the film print, combined with two CD-ROM drives to provide a four channel digital soundtrack. The removal of the soundtrack would also allow more of the film area to be used during filming, increasing the quality.
The format was not adopted.

List of School Rumble characters

The "School Rumble" manga and anime series features a cast of characters designed by Jin Kobayashi. The story takes place mostly in a Japanese high school and revolves around various love triangles and polygons. The manga series is followed by a short parallel world story, "School Rumble Z".
The manga alternates between several main protagonists. In the main storyline chapters, the protagonists are Tenma Tsukamoto and Kenji Harima. The side chapters focus on many of the side characters from the main chapters, with most of them focusing on Yakumo Tsukamoto. While many of the chapters are gag stories, the central theme of "School Rumble" is relationships, mostly because of love, and as the series progresses, characters are introduced, and situations are misinterpreted. Hence the relationship web becomes more complex. Since the characters are unable to let their true feelings be known to the one, they like tension, and rivalries build.
Creation and design.
Jin Kobayashi started writing the series "School Rumble" because he found the idea of a manga involving a delinquent falling in love interesting. Kobayashi's favorite character, Kenji Harima, is based largely on an amalgam of various friends, although he estimates "about 30%" of Harima is a reflection of himself. However, despite putting most of his personal feelings into the female characters, he stated that Ryuuhei Suga, a minor supporting character, is the most autobiographical. Most of the other characters are based on memories of former high-school classmates; As a manga author, Kobayashi also designed the cover art. Originally, the fifth volume's front cover was to feature Akira Takano, but after re-reading the volume Kobayashi concluded that since much of its plot in that volume revolves around Karen Ichijo, she should be on the cover instead. Desiring to feature a male character, he placed Harima on the cover of volume six.
An anime adaptation of the series was never envisaged by Kobayashi, and he was skeptical of the project when first approached. Negotiations and preparation took some time, but he claims to be happy with the result. On viewing the first anime footage, Kobayashi was astonished; he recalls in an interview his emotions at the time, stating "I was incredibly touched by it. Completely overcome." Impressed with the adaptation of his work, Kobayashi allowed the voice actors who voiced his characters significant freedom to interpret them as they chose. There were a number of cast changes throughout the production; Ami Koshimizu, the voice actress for Tenma, had initially auditioned for the role of Yakumo, and between "School Rumble"s first and second seasons the voice actors for both Karen Ichijou and Yoko Sasakura were replaced. Mako Sakurai took over Karen's role from Yuuka Nanri, and Aya Hirano replaced Akiko Kurumado as Yoko.
Main characters.
Tenma Tsukamoto.
The female protagonist. Short and fairly childish for her age, Tenma is often mistaken as being younger than her classmates and her younger sister Yakumo.
She does not perceive herself as particularly attractive to boys, although many of them acknowledge her cuteness. She aspires to be seen as a mature woman and endeavors to impress Karasuma through her cooking skills. One of her distinctive physical features are the little pigtails in her hair, which often wiggle if she is happy, excited and sometimes shocked. They also sag down if she is disappointed or sad. She is also slow and unreliable; she often misunderstands obvious situations. Despite her negative qualities, Tenma is good-natured, friendly, sweet, and very determined. She enjoys professional wrestling and, along with Harima, is a fan of the "jidaigeki" television show . Tenma also has relatively low academic scores. Both she and her sister have part-time jobs to make ends meet.
After knowing of Karasuma's disease, and even finding out that he lost all memories of her, she decided to transfer to the United States and continue her studies there in order to stay beside him. When she learns there is nothing that can be done, her life is given meaning and she decides to study medicine.
She makes her last appearance at the end of "School Rumble Z" comforting her sister.
According to the last Japanese poll performed by the publishers of the manga, Tenma is currently the fourth most popular character in the series.
In the anime adaptation of "Natsu no Arashi!" (which was also made by Jin Kobayashi), she and Harima made a cameo appearance at the cafe as customers wearing their school uniforms.
Kenji Harima.
The male protagonist. Harima is a stubborn and paranoid ex-delinquent who is in love with Tenma who still retains some aspects of his former persona, especially riding on his motorcycle and getting into fights with other delinquents during the beginning of the series. Harima's name is occasionally mistaken for the name of another person in class 2-D, Harry Mackenzie, because of the similarities in pronunciation. Harima, like his crush, Tenma, is a fan of the "jidaigeki" television show "The Three For The Kill". Harima lives with his older cousin Itoko, who is also Yakumo's homeroom teacher.
Harima began drawing manga as a means of escape after realizing Tenma was in love with Karasuma. In his manga, Harima inserts himself and Tenma into various storylines where the Harima-like character often defeats the Karasuma-like character and always wins the heart of the Tenma-like character. Later, he became serious about it after deciding to enter an amateur manga contest which he gets an honorable mention. Yakumo becomes his editor as she becomes the only person he trusts reading his manga. This results in misinterpretations by others, especially Tenma, who think they are dating because of Harima's desire to keep his work secret.
Harima's appearance changes throughout the series. He begins wearing sunglasses with a mustache, goatee and with his hair is pulled back with a headband, leaving an ahoge. He originally adopted this look to avoid being recognized by Tenma. The year before, he saved Tenma from a thug. However, as Tenma passed out Harima brought her back to rest at his place and when she woke up, Tenma, while grateful for the help against the thug, accused him of being a pervert. While Tenma has forgotten the incident, and his appearance fools her initially, as the series goes on she comes closer to remembering the incident. To avoid this, Harima tries to distract her when she appears to be on the verge of remembering. As the series progresses, he undergoes several changes in appearance. He has a long beard for a time (which he grew in an attempt to impress Tenma), a shaved head shortly following him shaving his beard off, and because Eri was mad at him for that she shaved the top of his head, and for a time has a shaved face because Eri accidentally cut it, and upon hearing that Tenma didn't like beards he shaved it off completely. Eventually he returns to the look the series started with. He also has his own finisher attack, named 'Hurricane Kick' (a portmanteau of his name, HARIma KENji) which parodies Kamen Rider's Rider Kick.
In the anime adaptation of "Natsu no Arashi!", he and Tenma made a brief cameo appearance with no spoken lines.
Oji Karasuma.
Karasuma is Tenma's love interest, depicted as an eccentric enigmatic, but distant character. Although it seems Tenma's feelings for him are unrequited, he shows true concern for her in the story on a more subtle level. His parents live in the United States; in the beginning of the story, Karasuma was supposed to move there, which caused Tenma, in a fit of despair, to write him a love scroll (it was initially meant to be a love letter, but Tenma had written what she felt, so in the end, it came out in the form of a scroll) which he reads all the way through, but ultimately decides to ignore because Tenma had forgotten to sign it.
As the school year continues, the two get increasingly closer thanks to Tenma's own incredible determination to be with him and occasional help by Harima. Eventually, Tenma reveals her feelings to Karasuma, but before she can get a reply he contracts a rare disease which causes memory loss to both his long-term and short-term memory. In chapter 273, Far and Away, before he completely lost his memory, he saw an illusion of Tenma and confess his love to her, that he had always loved her and promised himself that looking at her is just fine because he doesn't want her to be sad, but he couldn't keep the promise of him not falling in love with her. Tenma wasn't able to hear Karasuma's confession and decided to stay in the U.S. to become a doctor to cure Karasuma and hope he can remember about her and 2-C class. At the last chapter of "School Rumble", he starts to remember more about Tenma and 2-C.
Karasuma is secretly a famous manga artist, publishing his works under the pen name of . Harima, who really admired his manga, discovers this while pursuing his own manga artist ambitions. When he learns that Tenma was in love with Karasuma his respect turns into hatred, until Harima reconciles with himself internally that what he wants is for Tenma to be happy.
In "School Rumble Z", years have passed and he only regained some memories, but he is happy with Tenma by his side.
Eri Sawachika.
From her introduction onwards, Eri is characterized as having a dual nature. Talented, beautiful, wealthy, and popular, she is admired and envied by her classmates for the glamorous lifestyle that many believe her to lead. In reality, however, Eri uses this image and her outward confidence to mask her inward feelings of loneliness and insecurity. Her social status makes her unapproachable to many of her classmates and leaves her somewhat isolated from her peers. Even at home, her parents are away on business more frequently than not. The process by which Eri grows and matures, as she starts to develop deeper friendships and searches for love, forms the backbone of one of the main plotlines in the story. She also develops feelings for Kenji. She usually denies it, but as the story goes on her feelings for Kenji get stronger.
Eri is the illegitimate child of a prominent English businessman. Her mother is from Kyoto. Although Eri was born in Japan, she moved to England for her early schooling before returning to Japan to attend high school. As a result, her knowledge of kanji is limited, causing her to occasionally make humorous linguistic mistakes.
Eri's most striking features are her amber eyes and long blond hair (which she usually ties into pigtails), which signify her mixed British-Japanese heritage. While she is often admired for her looks, her origin is occasionally the subject of derisive remarks, such as during the class trip to Kyoto.
Kenji's nickname for Eri is , as a somewhat mocking reference to her status. In the English dub, Kenji would call her by the name "Rich Girl." Conversely, she addresses to Kenji as , even after he does away with his facial hair. In the English Dub, Eri calls him "Whiskers".
Yakumo Tsukamoto.
Yakumo is the most admired girl in school and Tenma's younger sister. Yakumo displays the ability to read the minds of those who find her attractive (though she once read Harima's mind before they got properly acquainted, and "heard" nothing but silence). She is also smart, beautiful and shy. Yakumo tries to cook all the meals for the house, being afraid of the mess and taste of Tenma's cooking. Despite her many positive qualities, Yakumo has never had a boyfriend, having turned down at least eight would-be suitors. Yakumo is scouted by several high school clubs because of her many talents; however, she declines joining most of them because she dreads spending time with Hanai, who follows her with the intent of joining the same clubs. Thanks to a ban on Hanai decreed by Akira, Yakumo becomes a member of the Tea Club along with her best friend, Sarah. As the story progresses and she becomes a manga editor, Yakumo falls in love with Harima. Later, they are rumored to be a couple, to the annoyance of Eri, who tries to interfere due to her own romantic feelings for Harima.
During Yakumo's childhood, her name is often mispronounced by Tenma as "Ya'mo", and Tenma's attempts to become a reliable older sister usually backfire due to her clumsiness much to her annoyance, leading to a short break up between them, until she starts recognizing Tenma's kindness towards her as far more important than any of her older sister's faults.
Yakumo finds a stray black cat with an X-shaped scar on its forehead who follows her to school. After several failed attempts, the cat no longer runs away from her. She gives him the name and brings him home to live with her, though he is continually wary of Tenma. Later, when Iori avoids Yakumo, Harima saves Iori from drowning, then pulls a thorn out of his leg, and the cat begins liking him.
In the characters popularity polls held by the publishers of the manga, Yakumo's standings rose during the series run, reaching the top position in the third and final poll.
Mikoto Suou.
Mikoto is a close friend of Tenma. She is a tomboyish large-breasted very pretty young woman who has a black belt in kenpo. She is often seen sparring with her childhood friend, Hanai. Mikoto is very athletic; she learns how to swim when forced to and becomes a competent basketball player in a short amount of time.
Although Mikoto always tries to help out others when they are having relationship problems, she herself has trouble facing her own relationship issues. When she was younger, Mikoto had a crush on her tutor, . When he returns after graduating, she breaks an agreement with Eri to meet him only to learn he has a girlfriend and because of that she hides her feelings for him. Later, she dates Asou, but the romance does not last long. She is very popular with the boys for her determination and amazing talent in sport, but mainly for her large breasts. Imadori especially constantly tries to touch her.
A "School Rumble Z" chapter features a storyline where she is married to Haruki Hanai.
Akira Takano.
The president of the Tea Club and a close friends with Tenma, Mikoto and Eri. Akira is very perceptive, resourceful, intelligent, and very mysterious. She has an uncanny ability to see through the true intentions of people (like Harima's feelings for Tenma), and her enigmatic face always hides schemes she creates to help her friends or play pranks on her classmates. The only prank of Akira's that fails involves her dressing up in a penguin suit and trying to catch her Tea Club members in an embarrassing position as they are trapped half-way between two floors. The prank backfired upon herself as she also gets caught, unable to escape. She is almost never seen smiling. During Tenma's birthday party, Tenma demands Akira show her a smile. Akira agrees and her and Tenma go off screen behind a door where Tenma remarks about it. She can also be seen smiling briefly when attempting to console a distressed Tenma during Episode 20 of Season 2. Her favorite victim is Haruki, who she early on appeared to dislike, but later shows to have some romantic feelings for him. She takes part-time jobs doing various dangerous secretive jobs which she does not tell her friends about. She tries not to spend the earnings.
She is the daughter of a journalist and has a younger half-sister, , who tends to be sick frequently.
In "School Rumble Z", she has taken the profession of an international agent. She is hired by Eri to help Mikoto and Hanai with their current problem. Akira targeted Ganji Nishimoto, who was the source of Haruki's problems. Using a high-tech camera she secretly takes pictures of Ganji trying to bribe others into voting for him. The pictures are then leaked to the public, causing Ganji to resign from his campaign to become mayor.
Haruki Hanai.
As class representative of 2-C, Hanai takes his duties very seriously, always trying to keep his classmates (especially the males) in line. Unable to have second thoughts, he always says exactly what comes into his mind regardless of the consequences. Although he is against perversion, he occasionally cannot help himself from temptations such as viewing sexy photos of Itoko Osakabe under the excuse of validating their authenticity or "confiscating" Ganji Nishimoto's entire porn tape collection. As a child, he was shy, weak, and always been bullied by other children. That changed with a little help from his childhood friend Mikoto.
He is married to Mikoto in one of the scenarios in "School Rumble Z", but at times neglects her because he is too busy. He is campaigning to be Mayor of Yagami. He was framed by Nishimoto, who is also bidding to be mayor of Yagami, and that just about puts his dream of being mayor away. However, he was able to resume campaigning after Akira dealt with Nishimoto.
Secondary characters.
Kyousuke Imadori.
Imadori is the class's number two pervert (the pervert ringleader being Ganji Nishimoto) earning him the nickname "Hummingbird". He has the special skill of knowing a girl's bra size just by looking at her chest. Interested only in girls with breast sizes of D or larger, the main targets of his flirting are Mikoto and Lala; he continues to pursue them relentlessly, although they continually beat him up. He has some physical abilities, such as being strong enough to grapple Hanai to a standstill. He works in his family's hair salon, Now Bird. Along with Tenma, he is the only high school character shown to enjoy the "tokusatsu" super sentai parody, "Hatenko Robo Dozibiron". He has a sensitive side to him, which he shows towards Lala when he tries to get her to smile at her part-time job, even at the cost of getting walloped by her.
While Imadori likes girls with large breasts, he's friendly to Ichijo to the point of even dating her. As the series progresses, their relationship develops and it becomes apparent he cares about her. He even quits his perverted acts just to please Karen.
Karen Ichijo.
Ichijo has monstrous strength despite having a weak and feminine appearance and is a member of the amateur wrestling club. Her power amazes even her strongest male classmates. It would also seem that she is not able to control her strength well, as shown when she nearly suffocates Tenma when trying to cover her mouth so that she does not blurt out secrets. Lara Gonzalez is her only rival in this regard, but has not been able to physically defeat her (In fact, Ichijo defeated her with her ultimate move, the "Frankensteiner"). Despite this, Ichijō has not reciprocated Lara's antagonism, always remaining polite towards her. Later the two seem to have developed into friends.
Despite her strength she has a kind nature and is one of the more timid girls in 2-C. She is in love with Imadori, but is embarrassed when this is hinted at. Imadori also initially avoids her, not only because of her small measures (later it is revealed that she does have considerably large breasts), but also because he fears her strength. She is also a good singer, and her singing is featured in episodes 2 and 6 of "School Rumble - Second Term".
When Imadori met her practicing wrestling and asked her why she liked it, she said that she really did not want to do wrestling. Later, when Imadori, along with Harima and Hanai were working for a moving company, they found out that Ichijō was also working with them as well as how strong she was. At the end of their shift, Imadori accidentally said that he could take Karen out on a date with his earnings, which Karen agrees to, even though Imadori did not really mean it. As the series progresses, Karen falls deeper in love with Imadori but continuously lacks the courage to act out. She is rewarded when she finally defeats him in a wrestling match however, with an indirect confession from him. The confession might even mean a proposal because of the ring he gives her.
Karen has a younger brother, who, like Imadori, is also a Dojibiron fan.
Karen is currently the 6th most popular character in the final popularity poll, making her the most popular character outside the main characters.
Harry Mackenzie.
Harry Mackenzie is a blonde-haired exchange student, skilled at fighting and a rival of Kenji Harima and Hanai. His name is pronounced the same as Harima's (in traditional Japanese use of family name first, Harima Kenji, with the exception that the j is replaced by a z) in Japanese, which leads to more than a few misunderstandings between the two. He is once mistaken as Harima by Hanai. A British or American exchange student, but based on the chapter 172 most likely British. Harry appears to have a deep reverence for samurai, based on episodes 21 and 22. He is extremely athletic, as seen during the sports festival. He rides a sports motorcycle that is a parody of Gundam, and can be seen usually hanging out with Masakazu Togo. He and Lala Gonzalez make a good team, as seen during the sports festival.

Lala Gonzalez.
Lala is an exchange student from Mexico, and a skilled practitioner of Lucha libre, which she learned from her father. She belongs to the same amateur wrestling club as Ichijo, who she sees her as a rival, often shouting "Ichijō!" when she meets her. Lara dislikes Ichijo's name because her mother, who abandoned her and her father when she was a child, was also named Karen.
She detests the pervert Imadori, especially when he managed to grope her chest while being choked. She thus tends to beat him up whenever she sees him after sufficient provocation. Lara also despises Imadori when he wins at a certain activity. Lara works in the same fast food restaurant as Ichijo, where no one dared to go to her counter because of her violent temper. She even grabs customers that annoy her and drags them inside for a beating. Lara's closest friends appear to be Harry and Togo, who both look out for her. Later, her animosity towards Ichijo softens. Her character is the direct opposite of her rival Ichijo, being that she is tall, well-endowed, sour-faced, hot-tempered, and very easily provoked.
Masakazu Tougou.
Masakazu is 2-D's class representative who sees class 2-C as rivals. Despite his obvious self-confidence, his character leads to rejections from his classmates. Later in the series, He shows some interest in Tenma, to Harima's distress. He is often seen with Harry. Some people around him usually refer to him with the nickname "Macaroni". He has a tendency to burst into extremely long inspirational speeches either involving facing challenges or being manly. As the series progressed, his self-confidence and passion for facing challenges head on have become so extreme that his actions and ideas often border on stupidity and often contain a lack of regard for the safety and well-being of others. His appearance is often followed by the American national anthem and has a tendency to refer to himself as an American, saying he lived in the states Texas, New York, Alaska and California. He is a skilled sportsman and martial artist, similar to his main rival Hanai, that he takes such things very seriously.

She stayed over with Yakumo to accompany her while Tenma was away for the Kyoto trip.
Sarah has several part-time jobs outside school. She is a nun at a local Catholic church, performing duties such as hearing confessions, playing the organ, and babysitting children. She reveals in a conversation with Akira that she may have an eye on someone indicating that she may be a novice; furthermore, at least one hopeful student has expressed interest in her. Aside from her duties as a nun, Sarah also works with Hiroyoshi Asō of 2-C at a Chinese restaurant, waiting tables and cooking. Hiroyoshi Asō may also be her love interest.

Some of his lines end with 'dasu (だす)' instead of the normal 'desu (です)' for some unknown reason. While his warm mentor-like demeanor and stash of "treasures" make him popular with many of the males in 2-C, his talents are less appreciated by the girls, especially Mai Otsuka, who has known him for a long time. While he gets along great with most of the boys in his class, he has misgivings about students who actually have girlfriends.

She has a fear that her past will get brought up, a weakness which Sasakura uses against her.
Her name "Itoko" is homonymous with the word "cousin" in Japanese which makes it a pun. Due to this pun, when Harima says "my cousin" it can be mistaken that he is saying "my Itoko".

The animals were later moved to the zoo when they were discovered running wild in a nearby Shinto shrine. In the anime, Shuji cooks up a plan to divert a news crew by faking to practice for a play. Pyotr is caught and since the animals care about Harima so deeply, they try their best to prove that they are harmless so that they don't need to be separated. They were still brought to the zoo where they were a big hit with children; and although Harima hates routine, he never broke his habit of visiting the zoo almost every day to see the animals.
Reception.
Stig Høgset from THEM Anime Reviews praised the characters' misunderstandings and noted that the viewer will generally root for them. Høgset also commented the English dub is "generally decent." Eduardo M. Chavez from Mania Beyond Entertainment also liked the main cast as well as the romance. In a later review, Chavez said that "Yakumo is by far the most intriguing character in this title" listing her as one of the most entertaining characters in the series. Sakura Eries from the same site was fond on Lala. While Carlo Santos from Anime News Network liked the variety of character designs, he noted "although the second-tier girls still look too much alike with their short black hairstyles." Nevertheless, he complained about the romance which he labelled as "filler". David F. Smith from IGN found the cast likable. Eduardo M. Chavez from Mania notes praised the way that Kobayashi introduces new themes to the second, bringing variety to the setting. Remarking on Kobayashi's ability to draw on numerous influences, Chavez applauds the manga artist for finding fresh ways of using old themes, preventing "School Rumble" from becoming derivative. He reserves his highest praise for the "flat" chapters dealing with Yakumo.

John Ames Mitchell

John Ames Mitchell (January 17, 1845 – June 29, 1918) was an American publisher, architect, artist and novelist. He was co-founder, editor, and publisher of the original "Life" magazine, in which he was a contributing artist, and the author of several novels.
Biography.
John Ames Mitchell was born in New York City on January 17, 1845. He was a Harvard University educated architect who studied at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1883 he co-founded "Life" magazine with Andrew Miller. Serving as president, Mitchell held a 75 percent interest in the magazine with the remainder by Miller in his job as secretary-treasurer. Both men retained their holdings until their deaths. Much more like today's "New Yorker" than the "Life" of the later 20th century, Mitchell's magazine discovered and encouraged many fine writers and artists at the turn of the century, such as Charles Dana Gibson, the illustrator who created the Gibson Girl. It covered the literary scene as well as political and social issues. He and Horace Greeley of the "New York Herald Tribune" founded the Fresh Air Fund, which for many years operated the Life Fresh Air camp for city kids on the site of today's Branchville School in Ridgefield, Connecticut, the town in which Mitchell also lived.
In 1875, Ames was hired by his uncle, Oliver Ames Jr., to design the Unity Church of North Easton.
Mitchell penned a half dozen novels. "The Last American", a fictional journal about a Persian admiral who rediscovers America in the year 2951, was published in 1889. "Amos Judd" (1895) was made into the 1922 silent film, "The Young Rajah", starring Rudolph Valentino. "Life" was purchased in 1936 by another Ridgefield resident, Henry Luce, who turned it into a picture-oriented magazine. The headquarters of Mitchell's "Life" is now the Herald Square Hotel in New York, a gift to Mitchell from Charles Dana Gibson in appreciation of the publisher's having seen and developed his potential as an artist.
Death and burial.
Mitchell died suddenly on June 29, 1918, at his home in Ridgefield, Connecticut, of apoplexy. He is buried in Fairlawn Cemetery in Ridgefield. Windover, his estate, was subdivided years ago, but the main house is still on West Lane. Its owner also operates the Herald Square Hotel, once Mitchell's "Life" headquarters.

The Hazelnut Child

"The Hazelnut Child" (German: "Das Haselnusskind") is a Bukovinian fairy tale collected by the Polish-German scholar Heinrich von Wlislocki (1856–1907) in "Märchen Und Sagen Der Bukowinaer Und Siebenbûrger Armenier" (1891, Hamburg: Verlagsanstalt und Druckerei Actien-Gesellschaft). Andrew Lang included it in "The Yellow Fairy Book" (1894) and Ruth Manning-Sanders included it in "A Book of Dwarfs" (1964).
Synopsis.
A childless couple prayed for a child, though he were no bigger than a hazelnut, and then they had such a son. He never grew, but he was very clever. When he was 15, he said he wanted to be a messenger. His mother sent him to get a comb from his aunt. He climbed on a horse that a man was riding by, and poked and pinched it until it galloped to the village. There he got the comb, and took another horse the same way. This convinced his mother. 
One day, his father left him in the fields with a horse while he went back home. A robber tried to steal the horse. The hazelnut child jumped on the horse and pricked it until it ignored the robber and galloped home. The robber was jailed.
When he was 20, the hazelnut child left home, promising to return when he was rich. He climbed on a stork as the storks were flying south. In Africa, he amused the king until the king gave him a large diamond. The hazelnut child took it with him when the storks flew north again, and so he and his parents were rich thereafter.
Analysis.
Tale type.
In his own notes to the tale, Wlislocki related it to the cycle of "Daumesdick" ("Thumbling"). In addition, in the late 19th century, editors of "Jahresbericht über die Erscheinungen auf dem Gebiete der germanischen Philologie", in a review of Wlislocki's book, equated the tale to German tale "Däumling" ("Thumbling").
In his 1987 study of folktales, folklorist D. L. Ashliman classified the tale as type AaTh 700, "Tom Thumb".

List of Basilisk characters

In the "Basilisk" universe, there are three main groups of characters, the Kouga Ninja, the Iga Ninja and others that are associated with the shogun. In the second season, "The Ōka Ninja Scrolls", a number of new characters are introduced.
Kouga Ninja.
The Kouga specialize in stealth and assassination with techniques that, for the most part, rely on subterfuge. Even abilities designed for battle, such as Gennosuke's Dojutsu, tend to be defensive in nature. In the second season, "The Ōka Ninja Scrolls", a number of new characters are introduced.
Gennosuke Kouga.
Gennosuke Kouga (甲賀 弦之介 "Kōga Gennosuke") the heir of Kouga Danjou who assumes leadership of the clan following his grandfather's death. An idealist and scholar who believes in looking to the future instead of being dominated by the past, Gennosuke views the pursuit of any grudge to be an ultimately pointless and self-destructive practice. He adheres to his ideals even after learning of the Hattori Truce's absolvement, prompting him to lead the Kouga on an expedition to Sunpu to plead with former Shogun Ieyasu and Hattori Hanzou to reinstate the treaty before any further bloodshed occurs. Yet despite being a man of peace, if pushed into a corner Gennosuke is more than capable of killing anyone who threatens him or his clansmen. In addition to his skill with the sword, Gennosuke wields a power passed down his bloodline called Dojutsu. A hypnosis technique, Dojutsu allows Gennosuke the ability to reverse the homicidal intent of anyone who meets his stare directly effectively causing them to kill themselves instead of him. Because of his power, the Iga level the playing field by temporarily blinding Gennosuke with the same Seven Days of Darkness ointment Oboro used on herself.
Prior to the conflict's renewal, Gennosuke had sought to end the clan hostilities by marrying the Iga Princess Oboro, whom he loved to a great extent. His feelings for her remain even as the body count among both clans rises, filling him with torment as he struggles to reconcile his personal feelings with the duty demanded of him as his clan's leader. In the anime, Gennosuke carries with him a flute which he frequently plays for Oboro and which symbolizes their hope of bringing the clans together in peace.
Eventually, unable to avoid facing Oboro, Gennosuke resigns himself to letting her kill him. Instead, Oboro kills herself whereupon Gennosuke writes in the scroll that the final person to survive was Oboro before joining her in death.
Kagerou.
Kagerou (陽炎 "Kagerō") is extremely attractive woman as well as an expert combatant (she carries a shikomizue in her walking cane and is highly adept at shurikenjutsu). Kagerou's sensuality is her deadliest weapon as her breath becomes poisonous when she's sexually aroused, an ability passed down by her mother. She's deeply and madly in love with her superior and cousin Kouga Gennosuke. But due to Gennosuke's feelings for Oboro and her own technique, she's unable to be with him either emotionally or physically; resulting in a jaded persona filled with envy and bitterness. Kagerou's favorite target for her frustrations is Oboro and was one of the more vocal opponents of her and Gennosuke's marriage, being quick to belittle and criticize Oboro every chance she gets. Captured by Tenzen following an attempt to assassinate Oboro, Kagerou was tortured to the brink of death. In her last moments, feeling that the Kouga were doomed to defeat and desiring to go to death with the one that she loves, Kagerou attempts to kill Gennosuke but is stopped by Oboro using her eye technique.
Kisaragi Saemon.
The elder brother of Okoi, Kisaragi Saemon (如月 左衛門) conducts himself in both war and peace with an almost professional sense of detachment. The only person he shows any real emotion to is his sister. Following Okoi's capture and death at the Iga's hands; Saemon throws himself whole-heartedly into the war between Koga and Iga, viewing victory for his clan and revenge for his sister as one and the same. Over the course of the battles, Saemon begins to understand and even agree with Gennosuke's views on the futility of revenge. Nevertheless, he also understands that the hostility on both sides makes reconciliation an impossible alternative.
A specialist in stealth and infiltration; Saemon is able to assume another person's identity by pressing their face into a raised mound of mud or soft clay, forming a mold with which he can insert his own face into to assume their appearance. This, along with his talent for impersonating voices, makes Saemon a master of disguise. His technique however is only effective cosmetically. It doesn't bestow him with any of a person's memories or abilities and anything with senses superior to a human's (as Hotarubi's snake proved) are able to see through it. Saemon is also one of the Kouga's more capable fighters, at one point successfully defending himself against multiple Iga ninjas at once. Saemon was the only ninja to be killed by forces other than Kouga or Iga, when Tenzen violated the honor code of the two clans and enlisted the help of Lady Okufu's vassals to gain the upper hand, and Saemon is impaled through the torso atop a bridge. By the end, Saemon killed Hotarubi and assisted in the deaths of three other Iga ninjas (Yashamaru, Koshiro, and Akeginu).
Muroga Hyouma.
Muroga Hyouma (室賀 豹馬 "Muroga Hyōma") is Gennosuke's uncle and the second in command to Danjo. Like Gennosuke, Hyouma possesses the Doujutsu technique and was the one who originally taught Gennosuke how to use it. Unlike Gennosuke, Hyouma's Dojutsu is always in effect so he must keep his eyes shut or else risk accidentally killing the wrong person at the wrong time. To compensate, Hyouma develops an almost radar-like sense of hearing that makes it impossible for him to be snuck up on. Hyouma's Doujutsu can only be used at night. Although he distrusts the Iga; Hyouma understands that despite whatever differences may exist between people, they are still humans who live, feel, and die the same way. It was due to Hyouma's teachings that Gennosuke was able to see past his clan's hatred for the Iga and attempt to establish peace, which Hyouma supports whole heartedly. He easily kills Mino Nenki with his Doujutsu when Mino Nenki underestimates his two blind opponents, Hyouma and the recently blinded Gennosuke. He dies in a duel with the now-blinded Koshirou. Due to Koshirou being blind, Hyouma could not use his Doujutsu on him. Koshiro slashes Hyouma's ear, which destroys Hyouma's ability to locate his opponent through hearing. Though Hyouma dies, he stays standing on his feet in the end. He is the seventh of the Kouga's chosen 10 to die.
Kasumi Gyoubu.
Tall, bald, and powerfully muscled, Kasumi Gyoubu (霞 刑部 "Kasumi Gyōbu") is strong enough to break an enemy in half with nothing more than his bare hands. Like Saemon, he specializes in stealth and infiltration. By using his technique to merge into any solid surface, Gyoubu gains the cover to move and attack in complete secrecy as well as manipulate any object in physical contact with the surface. Because only his body can merge, he must strip naked as well as drop any weapons he carries in order to use the technique. He hates the Iga overwhelmingly as years earlier, Gyoubu's father Renbu was murdered by an Iga squad and Gyoubu vowed to one day take revenge, since his father's last words were to never pity any ninja. However, the Hattori truce was imposed on both clans shortly afterward and Gyoubu shaved his head as a statement of his unsatisfied fury. In the anime, Gyoubu shares an uncle/niece bond with the tomboyish Okoi whom he frequently takes with him to go hunt wild boar in the forests surrounding Manjidani. None of his backstory is included in the manga and his bald appearance is due to a physical condition, rather than a show of hatred. He is linked after being impaled in the heart by Tenzen. He is the sixth of the Kouga's chosen 10 to die.
Okoi.
Tomboyish and energetic with a well-endowed frame, Okoi (お胡夷) embodies the popular concept of the Kunoichi (in contrast to both Akeginu and Kagerou who embody the more historically traditional version). She shares a deep bond with her older brother Saemon and is one of the few people who can make him smile. In the anime, Okoi also has a strong friendship with the normally unapproachable Gyoubu whom she often goes with to hunt wild boar in the forests surrounding Manjidani. Although she's a capable fighter, Okoi is not opposed to using her ample assets to lure men into a state of false security if she has to. For once they make the mistake of forming physical contact, Okoi is able to adhere her skin onto her opponent's and then absorb their blood into herself; leaving her enemies as dried up husks. Upon completion, Okoi must then vomit out the excess blood before she can use the technique again. As more contact equals faster blood drain she is dressed in a more revealing manner than the other kunoichi with a hip length sleeveless kimono and shortened hakama that resemble Daisy Dukes. Her death occurred when Nenki stiffened his hairs into needles and impaled her in multiple places, leaving her on the floor to die. She is the fifth of the Kouga's chosen 10 to die.
Udono Jousuke.
Good-humored, a little dumb, and extremely fat; Udono Jousuke (鵜殿 丈助 "Udono Jōsuke") hardly fits the traditional concept of the ninja. And as he proved with his interactions with Akeginu; he's also a bit of a lecher. Despite his boorish demeanor, Jousuke is more perceptive than he lets on and during his stay with Gennosuke in Tsubagakure, he was the first to realize the Iga were planning something suspicious before they silenced him. Additionally, while his corpulent physique suggests otherwise, Jousuke possesses remarkable speed and agility for a man of his size as he was able to easily avoid the attacks of both Rousai and Akeginu, two of the Iga's strongest fighters. His obesity is also the secret to his technique as it grants his body the consistency of rubber; allowing him to bounce like a ball, roll over enemies like a living boulder, deflect physical attacks with ease, squeeze through openings impossible even for someone a quarter of his girth, or even float into the sky by rapidly inhaling air to blow himself up like a balloon. He is killed by Jingoro after getting too cocky while he had the upper hand over him. Despite his quick death, he is likely one of Kouga's strongest ninjas. Jousuke was easily able to defeat Akeginu without realizing that the treaty was broken, despite her intent to kill him. Also, the impatient Gyoubu was calmed slightly when being told that Jousuke was with Gennosuke, and even thought it possible that Jousuke and Gennosuke defeated all of the Iga ninja already. He is the fourth of the Kouga's chosen 10 to die.
Jimushi Jubei.
A living torso, Jimushi Jubei (地虫 十兵衛) lacks both arms and legs but is able to move by flexing his chest muscles to manipulate the armor plates sewn onto his tunic, allowing him to slither along the ground at extremely high speeds. He also has a metal tail attachment which he can use to deflect weapons and control himself as he moves. In place of arms, Jubei has trained his tongue to extend out of his mouth to manipulate objects as well as to draw and attack with the dagger he keeps sheathed inside his esophagus. He is gifted in astrology, which he uses to predict the Kouga's future with surprising accuracy. He is able to surprise and kill Tenzen with his hidden weapon, and retrieve the scroll from the Iga. However, his end is met shortly after when he encounters a revived Tenzen, who already knows about his secret weapon and slices him in half. He is the third of the Kouga's chosen 10 to die.
Kazamachi Shougen.
Kazamachi Shougen (風待 将監 "Kazamachi Shōgen") is a grotesque and malformed hunchback; Shogen's long gangly limbs and oversized hands and feet grant him the agility and dexterity of a spider. He also possesses a long prehensile tongue that secretes a sticky glue-like substance which Shogen can fling as pellets, spray as a stream, or even weave into a net similar to a spider's web. As such, Shogen is one of the few members of the Kouga ten who specializes in combat rather than stealth and assassination. His personality is sadistic and he enjoys toying with his enemies before killing them. When Hattori Hanzou summoned the clan elders to meet with him at Sunpu, Shogen was chosen by Danjo to accompany him as an example of the Kouga's fighting skills. During his attempt to return to Manjidani with the Kouga's copy of the battle scroll, Kazamachi was ambushed by the Iga but he managed to capture them in his glue net. However, he became distracted by Hotarubi's butterflies whereupon Nenki used his hair to bury one of Koshirou's scythes into Kazamachi's head. Alive but paralyzed, Kazamachi was repeatedly stabbed to death by Hotarubi when she demanded to know whether Yashamaru was safe and he defiantly spat in her face. Despite his quick death, Shougen is likely one of the strongest Kouga ninjas. He was able to even gain the upper hand on the four ninjas that ambushed him before he was distracted by Hotarubi's butterflies. He is the second of the Kouga's chosen 10 to die.
Later, during the Iga's surprise raid on Manjidani, Koshirou was attacked by an unnamed kouga ninja with deformities and skills similar to Shogen, suggesting that an entire family of spider-like ninja exist in Kouga.
Danjou Kouga.
Lord of the Kouga Manjidani ninja clan, Danjou Kouga (甲賀 弾正 "Kōga Danjō") was ordered by retired shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu to lead nine other warriors besides himself against the chosen ten of the rival Iga Tsubagakure clan to determine a successor to the shogunate. Danjo greatly specializes in the use of poisoned throwing needles, which he can spit from his mouth with lethal precision, it is also implied that he might've also inherited the Doujutsu technique as it implied that it is inherited by bloodline. As a young man, he fell in love with the Iga chieftess Ogen whom he planned to marry so that peace could be established between their clans. Fate conspired against them in the form of a surprise attack on Tsubagakure by the forces of Oda Nobunaga with the assistance of the Kouga. Despite the fact the attack had occurred without his knowledge or consent, the crushed Ogen was unable to forgive Danjo for his clan's actions and their hopes for peace and happiness with each other were lost forever. Nevertheless, Danjo never gave up his desire of one day bringing peace between Kouga and Iga and years later, permitted his grandson Gennosuke to become engaged to Ogen's adopted granddaughter Oboro until Ieyasu's decree forced him to bring a decisive end to the longstanding feud by any means necessary. After sending Kazamachi to deliver the Kouga's copy of the scroll, he steals the Iga's copy from Yashamaru and then fires two darts into Ogen's neck. Distracted by Ogen's hawk, Danjou dies when the still living Ogen pulls out one of the needles and stabs him through the back. He is the first of the Kouga's chosen 10 to die.
Iga Ninja.
Rather than relying on deception, the Iga prefer more direct methods and their techniques tend to be mostly offensive to better give them an edge in close combat situations.
Oboro.
The adopted heir of the Iga clan, Oboro (朧) ascends to leadership following the death of Ogen only to have her authority usurped by Tenzen. Born with "mystic eyes", Oboro has the power to neutralize the techniques and special abilities of any ninja who meets her stare directly. This power is constantly in effect and has the potential to affect both enemies as well as allies. Prior to the lifting of the Hattori truce, Oboro is engaged to Gennosuke Kouga in an attempt to bring a lasting peace between both clans. In the anime, Oboro would frequently meet with Gennosuke along their clan's borders to practice a Japanese fan dance which they planned to perform for the guests at their wedding.
Sweet natured with a gentle disposition, Oboro lacks any real talent for either martial arts or ninjutsu and is also a bit of a klutz. This, along with her love for Gennosuke has caused most of Iga to view Oboro as a black sheep, a fact she is painfully aware of.
When the Hattori truce is lifted, the other Iga are quick to take advantage of Oboro's feelings for Gennosuke, tricking her into inviting him and Udono Jousuke into their compound where the Iga can keep them under surveillance. Although hurt and betrayed by their actions, Oboro remains loyal to her clan and is greatly torn between her duty and her feelings when the truth of the renewed conflict is finally revealed to her. Ultimately, she makes the decision to temporarily seal her eyes shut with a potion given to her by Ogen called the Seven Days of Darkness, knowing that if she saw any of her clansmen attacking Gennosuke, she might be tempted to use her powers against them instead.
Despite her best efforts, when Lady Ofuku and her faction enter the conflict, Oboro is forced to face against a blinded Gennosuke in the final episode. In an attempt to both defy her fate and make amends for the Kouga her clansmen had killed, she refuses to kill Gennosuke. Instead she goes up to him, tells him that she loves him, and commits suicide, ending her own life.
Yakushiji Tenzen.
The second in command to Ogen, Yakushiji Tenzen (薬師寺 天膳) is able to wrestle control of the Iga away from Oboro following Ogen's death to become Iga's de facto leader. Although his initial impression is of a pragmatic fighter concerned solely for the honor and future of his clan, Tenzen is actually a sadistic and malicious individual who revels in conflict and bloodshed. He fights with a ruthless tenacity and won't hesitate to involve innocent bystanders to guarantee a victory. He also lusts after Oboro and desires to take her for his wife in order to become the true lord of the Iga even if he has to rape her to do it, which he attempts at least twice over the course of the series.
Similar to Himura Genma of Ninja Scroll, Tenzen's technique is one of regeneration and immortality. He was born sharing his body with a symbiotic being that usually conceals itself so that only its closed eyes are visible as a wart/growth on Tenzen's ears. The creature awakens whenever Tenzen is wounded or killed, moving through his body to regenerate him by "eating" his wounds, thereby restoring whatever ravages of time or battle Tenzen might experience. Thanks to his powers, by the time of Basilisk's beginning, Tenzen was already well over 200 years old though physically he looks no older than 30. Even when decapitated, Tenzen can regenerate if someone holds his head to his body while his symbiote seals the cut.
In the manga, Ogen tells Oboro that the symbiote creature is Tenzen's twin brother with whom he merged with inside their mother's womb shortly before being born. In the anime however Ogen stops just before telling Oboro where she believed the parasite came from, leaving its identity ambiguous. The anime also expands slightly on Tenzen's backstory, by identifying his mother as an Iga woman who was slain by her lover (a member of the Kouga ninjas and Tenzen's father). Baby Tenzen was then cut from his mother's womb and taken to be raised as a Kouga. Years later the Adult Tenzen would defect to the Iga where, unbeknownst to the others, he secretly manipulated both clans into retaining their hatred for each other in the name of his own vengeance.
Over the course of the story, Tenzen dies a total of four times at the hands of Jubei, Gyoubu, Hyouma, and Kagerou; before finally dying for good when he's decapitated by Gennosuke and then has his symbiote purged by Oboro's mystic eyes. For the most part, the Kouga ninja did not know what Tenzen's abilities were, which allowed Tenzen to kill several of the Kouga ninja who thought he was dead. He used this tactic to kill Jubei, Gyoubu, Saemon, and to capture Kagerou (leading to her death).
Akeginu.
As the bodyguard and confidant of Princess Oboro, Akeginu (朱絹) is more forgiving of Oboro's lack of ninja skills than the rest of their clan, caring for her almost as an older sister. Regardless, her first loyalty is to the whole of Iga and when word of the Hattori Truce's absolvement reaches her, Akeginu has no reservations about deceiving Oboro while aiding her clansmen in their attempt to assassinate the Kouga ten, including Gennosuke. Despite her duties, Akeginu does feel some degree of sympathy for Oboro's predicament and is one of the few members of Iga besides Tenzen's apprentice Koshirou who doesn't ostracize her following Oboro's decision to seal her eyes. She even keeps safe from the other Iga the flute Gennosuke left behind in Tsubagakure so Oboro would have a memento of him after the war's end. She's also in love with Koshirou, whom she wishes to marry.
A highly attractive woman, Akeginu (like Kagerou her Kouga counterpart) is representative of the historically accurate version of the kunoichi in her ability to use her sex appeal against the opposite sex. In combat, her technique enables her to secrete blood from her pores which she can then squirt into an opponent's face to blind them or to create a fine mist which grants her the cover to move and attack in complete stealth. Her technique can also be used to "tag" an opponent who specializes in covert movement, as she demonstrated during Tenzen's duel with Gyoubu.
After Koshirou was killed by Kagerou, a revenge-driven Akeginu was led by Saemon (who had taken the appearance of Tenzen) to a bridge where she then attempted to kill Kagerou only to be grabbed by Saemon which then allowed Kagerou to stab her through the heart. Afterwards, Akeginu's body is dumped into the nearby river, and drifted into the sunset.
Chikuma Koshirou.
Apprentice to Tenzen, Chikuma Koshirou (筑摩 小四郎 "Chikuma Koshirō")'s technique enables him to create miniature whirlwinds with his breath which suck his enemies in and then shreds them to pieces. He also wields a pair of kama hand scythes, which he can use in close combat or throw like boomerangs. After Gennosuke learned of the Hattori Truce's absolvement, Tenzen sent Koshirou to eliminate him. However, when Oboro attempted to stop the fight, Gennosuke used his Dojutsu to turn Koshirou's whirlwind back onto himself and completely destroy Koshirou's eyes. Gradually, Koshirou learns to use his other senses to compensate but still requires some sort of assistance to effectively fight.
Koshirou and Oboro grew up together, and despite the differences in their stations she sees him as an older brother. Koshirou himself is completely devoted to Oboro and is even suggested to have romantic feelings for her. His loyalty to Tenzen compels him to follow his sensei's orders regardless of how he personally feels. He's also the love interest of Akeginu although he's more or less oblivious to it otherwise.
In the anime Koshirou is an expert woodcarver and after being blinded, learns to carve with equal skill using his sense of touch alone. Of all of Basilisk's characters, Koshirou varies the most between the anime and the original manga, where he shares Tenzen's sheer ruthlessness and arrogance in combat, while the anime depicts him as being more reluctant to fight any battle where his opponents would suffer an overwhelming disadvantage.
After killing Hyouma, he was in turned killed by Kagerou using her poisonous breath, who he thought was Akeginu when Saemon (impersonating Akeginu's voice) tricked him into thinking that Oboro had been murdered by the Kouga. His death greatly disturbs Akeginu, who wants nothing but revenge afterwards - which leads her to her own downfall, at the hands of Kagerou and Saemon.
Amayo Jingorou.
Loathsome and cowardly at heart, Amayo Jingorou (雨夜 陣五郎 "Amayo Jingorō") is one of the few Iga ninjas who specialize in assassination rather than combat, preferring to sneak up on his opponents and being quick to flee once he suffers a disadvantage. He also openly mocks Oboro's unwillingness to fight, which in the anime almost gets him killed when an upset Oboro orders for no one to provide him with water which he needs to survive after using his technique.
By smearing himself with salt, Jingoro is able to dissolve into a viscous semi-liquid form; enabling him to slither through the tightest of passages, ooze his way up vertical surfaces, and silently creep onto his target to deliver the killing stroke. Remaining in this form for an extended period of time causes him to suffer extreme dehydration as his body gradually dries up and shrivels away, requiring him to immerse himself in water in order to restore his human form. His powers causes him to suffer an extreme fear of the ocean, as the salt water would keep him in a constant fluid state and causing him to completely dissolve.
Forcefully dragged onto a ferry during the Iga's attempt to catch up to the Kouga, Jingoro's fears are realized when Gyoubu throws him overboard and into the bay, where he quickly melts into nothing. Akeginu had attempted to retrieve him, but couldn't get to him in time due to Oboro's safety being her top priority; when she finally was able to help Jingoro, all that was left of him was a jacket floating in the ocean.
Hotarubi.
A petite and slender young woman with straight dark hair that drapes to just below her shoulders, Hotarubi (蛍火) embodies the concept of the traditional Japanese beauty. Although she shares her clan's hatred for the Kouga, Hotarubi's prime concern is for her fiancé Yashamaru, another member of the Iga ten. Her devotion to him is so great that even the suggestion that he's come to harm is enough to send her into reactions that range from a mere evil stare (like when Mino Nenki makes a bad joke about it) to a feral rage (when Shougen refuses to tell her if Yashamaru is alive or not, and she brutally stabs him to death). Like most of the Iga, Hotarubi considers Oboro to be a completely useless leader and defers to Tenzen's orders. In the anime, this may be tied to slight jealousy, since Yashamaru once teased her for not being sweet and feminine like Oboro and a comically offended Hotarubi threw a childish tantrum at him.
In combat, Hotarubi summons swarms of glowing pink butterflies that overwhelm and distract her opponents, allowing her to either strike a lethal blow through their dropped defenses with her tantō or escape to safety. She also maintains a spiritual link with her pet viper who acts as her bodyguard and scout. In the anime, Hotarubi summons and controls her butterflies through a barely audible chant.
Hotarubi was brutally killed by the Koga ninja Saemon while he was disguised as Mino Nenki. Already weakened from a wound on her leg, after Hotarubi unmasks him she is no match for Saemon, who cuts off both of her arms to prevent her from summoning her butterflies and then stabs her through the chest. However, with an obvious sense of mercy and honor, he gives a slight nod to the dying Hotarubi when, delusional in her final moments, she pictured him as Yashamaru. Her body falls into a ravine, but she dies in peace and with a sad smile on her lips, believing in her last moments to have been with Yashamaru.
Mino Nenki.
With his simian features, excessive body hair, and use of a bo staff, Mino Nenki (蓑 念鬼) bears a strong resemblance to Sun Wukong, the monkey king of Chinese Mythology. His demeanor is boisterous and arrogant, which often makes him underestimate his opponents and leads him to act carelessly in battle, despite frequent orders from Tenzen to the contrary. Nenki is also more patient than the other Iga with Oboro's indecision, viewing her infatuation for Gennosuke as a childish phase born out of her sheltered view of the world and believing that as time goes by she'll eventually grow out of it.
Mino Nenki is one of Iga's strongest fighters. Although lethally proficient with his staff, Nenki's greatest weapon is the control he exercises over his own hair. Draping down his back in a tangled mat, Nenki is able to straighten his hair and manipulate it as a grasping tool. His hair is also strong enough to swing him from tree to tree (leaving his hands free for combat) or even to wrap around an enemy and crush them like a Boa Constrictor. Beneath his robes, his body is covered in coarse fur that can be stiffened into needles to skewer any opponent that gets too close and also provides protection from certain techniques; this the technique he uses to kill Okoi, in example, stabbing her to death when she attacks him after killing Rousai. In the manga, Nenki's hair reflects his moods; writhing wildly whenever he becomes enraged or excited.
Nenki is ultimately killed by underestimating Hyoma, thinking of him as a blind and defenseless target, only to be engulfed by Hyoma's Doujutsu and subsequently strangles himself to death with his own hair.
Azuki Rousai.
The second oldest of the Iga after Tenzen, Azuki Rousai (小豆 蠟斎 "Azuki Rōsai") is a short statured elderly man with an even shorter temper and a massive gourd-shaped head, which in the anime he claims is swollen with hatred for the Koga due to their surprise assault on the Iga alongside Nobunaga.
Although his frail and antiquated appearance says otherwise, Rousai is a highly skilled martial artist whose punches and kicks are capable of felling trees and smashing rocks with one blow. As such, he's one of the few characters who specializes in unarmed combat. Additionally, Rousai's ninja technique enables him to stretch and contort his limbs in fantastic ways, allowing him to fight and grapple with his opponents from well outside their range of attack.
Being somewhat of a lecher, Rousai causes his own death during his attempt to interrogate Okoi. He threateningly caresses the captured girl's shoulder, allowing her to attach herself to him and drain all the blood from his body with her own powers, like a vampire or a leech.
Yashamaru.
A brash and cocky young man, Yashamaru (夜叉丸)'s favored weapons are dozens of strands of garotte wires called Kokujou (black rope, or black binding) which are woven from the hair of young women and alchemically treated with natural oils harvested from wild animals, turning them as hard as steel. Yashamaru controls the Kokujou as though they are an extension of his own body, and can use them to tie an opponent up, slice them to pieces, flay them, or even stiffen the wires so they can pierce like needles. The wires are usually kept wrapped around Yashamaru's forearms, but extra wires are tied around his calves in the event his hands and/or upper body becomes immobilized. He also carries a cleaver in a sheathe on his back although his opponents rarely get close enough that he's required to draw it.
Chosen by Ogen to demonstrate the Iga's skills for Ieyasu, Yashamaru accompanied his clan's leader to Sunpu and was later charged to deliver to the Iga their copy of the battle scroll. After realizing it was lost, he is tricked by Saemon (voicing Tenzen) and then taken off guard by Gyoubu, who snaps his neck. Despite his quick death, Yashamaru is easily one of Iga's strongest fighters. He was able to fight on par with Shougen, who was able to hold his own fairly well against four Iga ninjas alone. Yashamaru was even able to gain the upper hand on Kisaragi Saemon before being killed by Gyoubu.
Unlike most of the Iga clan, the easygoing Yashamaru had begun to consider the Hattori truce beneficial as it allowed him a chance to live a peaceful and quiet life with his lover and comrade Hotarubi, whom he planned to marry before the treaty's cancellation resulted in all out war between the clans. The possibility of his death sends Hotarubi into recklessness, which proves to be her undoing later.
Ogen.
As the elderly chieftess of the Iga Tsubagakure ninja clan, Ogen (お幻) was ordered by retired Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu to lead nine other warriors in a duel against the chosen ten of the rival Kouga Manjidani clan to determine a successor to the shogunate. She shares a spiritual connection to her hawk which serves as her messenger and servant although it is unknown if she possesses any other abilities, though it is implied that she may have had the mystic eyes as Danjou had knowledge of them and Oboro likely inherited from her.
When she was younger, she was very much in love with Kouga Danjo and the two sought peace between the warring clans through their marriage. But following a surprise attack by the combined forces of Oda Nobunaga and the Kouga in which her grandfather was murdered, she lost all faith in Danjo and declared herself his enemy. Despite the Kouga's betrayal, Ogen was in her twilight years willing to make her adopted granddaughter Oboro the bride of Danjo's grandson Gennosuke in the hopes that the two of them could bring a definite peace and also find the happiness that she could not.
In the manga, while not outright hateful towards Oboro, Ogen tends to view her as a disappointment to the clan and is hinted to have only consented to her marrying Gennosuke due to her granddaughter's lack of fighting skills. In contrast, in the anime was more forgiving of Oboro's faults and even attempted to boost her self-esteem when she failed in her training by saying she preferred her as sweet and loving. She also took pains to hide the Kouga's actions following Nobunaga's surprise attack so Oboro wouldn't become infected with the Iga's hatred. This may be explained by how the details about relationship between her and Danjou are exclusive to the anime series.
Other.
Tokugawa Ieyasu.
The elderly former Shogun, who appears to be suffering from some sort of throat cancer as evidences by the bulbous growth beneath his chin. Although retired, he still possesses enough influence within the government to revoke the Hattori truce in order to resolve the succession dispute. Historically, Ieyasu is regarded as an effective but extremely heartless ruler. Basilisk maintains this image of him as he clearly views both Kouga and Iga as expendable in the face of ensuring political stability and his family's grip on power.
Hattori Hanzou (the 1st) Masanari.
The head of a prominent ninja family from Iga Province who would later become chief of the Shogun's intelligence. In the anime, he helped the people of Tsubagakure escape Nobunaga's attack. The peace treaty between Iga Tsubagakure and Kouga Manjidani was originally implemented by him.
Hattori Hanzou (the 4th) Masahiro.
The third son of Hattori Hanzou and the current leader of the Shogun's intelligence. Although he dislikes the idea of turning Kouga and Iga loose, his loyalty to Ieyasu compels him to nullify his father's anti-war pact for the sake of avoiding civil war amongst the other Shogunate retainers. He was amongst the audience that witnessed the duel between Yashamaru and Shogen at Sunpu Castle and would later witness the duel between Oboro and Gennosuke alongside his adopted son Kyohachiro and Lady Ofuku. Although his demeanor can be considered cold and non-chalant, he was deeply moved by Gennosuke and Oboro's sacrifice and afterwards enacts a new peace treaty in which the spoils promised to the winner were evenly distributed between both clans. He also recovers the battle scroll from Ieyasu and secures it in a hidden alcove of his mansion so that the memory of the 20 chosen ninja would not be completely forgotten.
Hattori Kyouhachirou.
The nephew and adopted son of Hattori Hanzou the 4th (his birth father was Hattori Hanzou the 2nd). Kyohachiro was charged by Hanzou to monitor the duel between Kouga and Iga and then report the results to him and Lord Ieyasu. Although he initially has his subordinates witness the battles, following Gennosuke's victory over the Iga at Tsubagakure, Kyohachiro eventually decides that the Kouga/Iga duel is something he has to see for himself personally. Gradually, Kyohachiro begins to regret the slaughter caused for the sake of deciding the heir to the shogunate and because of this, Oboro in the anime entrusts him with Gennosuke's flute which she explains is their prayer for the future. After witnessing Oboro and Gennosuke's match alongside his father and realizing just what had been done to them, Kyohachiro leaves on a pilgrimage to Aekuni Shrine to present Gennosuke's flute as an offering, vowing that even if history forgot the sacrifice made by the twenty ninjas of Kouga and Iga, he would remember them always. In the manga, he doesn't appear until volume 4 when he reports to his father that Lady Ofuku had departed in an attempt to sway victory in the Iga's favor.
Nankoubou Tenkai.
A Tendai Buddhist monk and political adviser for the Shogunate. Tenkai was the one who suggested to Ieyasu that since the Tokugawas are a military family, the succession dispute should be settled though some sort of organized duel between ninja instead of valued samurai. As the duel between the Kouga and Iga rages on, Ieyasu sends him into the inner castle to keep the peace between Ofuku and Oeyu. He later returns in Basilisk's sequel series, The Yagyu Ninja Scrolls, where he takes on a more saintly role. He is the twin brother of Ashina Dohaku, who serves as the main villain in the second half of The Yagyu Ninja Scrolls.
Yagyu Munenori.
A Kenjutsu instructor of the Yagyū Shinkage-ryū school, of whom the Tokugawa Shogunate was a loyal patron. He was among the audience that witnessed Yashamaru and Kazamachi's duel at Sunpu and follows the war alongside Ieyasu. Because of their barely reined hostility to each other and the awesome power of their techniques, he views the ninjas of Kouga and Iga as being more akin to demons than humans.
Ofuku.
The godmother of Takechiyo and leader of the faction supporting his claim to the Shogunate. A cold and heartless woman who murdered her husband's mistress and illegitimate child, Ofuku's only redeeming grace is her devotion to her protege Takechiyo whom see considers a surrogate son, at one point even risking her life to save his when the Kunichiyo faction poisoned him. Knowing that if Takechiyo falls from power than so will she, Ofuku attempts to personally intervene in the ninja war despite orders from Ieyasu to the contrary. After witnessing Oboro's suicide, Ofuku rashly orders her samurai to assassinate Gennosuke only to witness them die at the hands of his Dojutsu. Although Gennosuke decided to spare her life, Ofuku is mentally crushed after the Iga's apparent loss and as punishment for her scheming, Hattori Hanzou decides to keep her in the dark regarding how Gennosuke abdicated victory.
Oeyo.
The consort of Ieyasu's son, the current Shogun Hidetada. Although she gave birth to both Kunichiyo and Takechiyo, she favors Kunichiyo and leads the faction supporting his claim to the Shogunate. Oeyo is just as heartless and manipulative as Ofuku, her rival from long before the succession dispute, and is suggested in the anime that she or one of her followers poisoned Takechiyo's tea.
Takechiyo.
Ieyasu's eldest surviving grandson, represented by the Iga. His slow witted nature is the basis of the succession dispute.
Kunichiyo.
Ieyasu's second grandson, represented by the Kouga. Although the younger of the two brothers, Kunichiyo's intelligence and cleverness has caused many within the government to view him as more deserving of the Shogunate over his elder sibling. As an adult he was renamed Tokugawa Tadanaga and became the Dainagon of Suruga.
Oda Nobunaga.
In the anime, Nobunaga makes a cameo appearance during the flashback of episode 1 as he leads the surprise attack on Tsubagakure. His appearance is similar to his depictions in the Onimusha and Samurai Warriors video game series with thin features, ghostly white skin, elegantly groomed mustache and goatee, and a western-style cape draped over his shoulders.
Kasumi Renbu.
The father of Kasumi Gyoubu who appears only in the anime. Under the command of the Koga elder, Renbu was ordered to hunt down and eliminate any Iga who escaped Nobunaga's assault, but was stopped by Lord Kouga Danjo when he attempted to kill Ogen in the forests behind Tsubagakure. Despite being a ruthless combatant, Renbu's deepest desire was for his son to live a life free of conflict and bloodshed and eventually became a supporter of Danjo's desire to build a lasting peace with the Iga. Sent by Danjo to meet with them as a representative, Renbu and his companions were ambushed by an Iga squad who sought revenge for the attack he led on their clan. Renbu was mortally wounded during the fight and his final words to Gyoubu before he died was to never pity any ninja.
The Oka Ninja Scrolls.
Broadcast in 2018, "Oka Ninja Scrolls" is a sequel to the original "Basilisk" anime series, after a 10-year time-skip.

Omnilingual

"Omnilingual" is a science fiction short story by American writer H. Beam Piper. Originally published in the February 1957 issue of "Astounding Science Fiction", it focuses on the problem of archaeology on an alien culture.
Synopsis.
An expedition from Earth to Mars discovers a deserted city, the remains of an advanced civilization that died out 50,000 years before. The human scientists recover books and documents left behind, and are puzzled by their contents. Earnest young archeologist Martha Dane deciphers a few words, but the real breakthrough comes when the team explores what appears to have been a university in which the last few civilized Martians made their last stand. Inside, they find a "Rosetta Stone": the periodic table of the elements. The story builds tension from the skepticism of the rest of the team, mostly male, as well as from Dr. Dane's competitive, spotlight-seeking teammate, Tony Lattimer.
Reception.
Jo Walton stated that "Omnilingual" was "influential" and ""the" classic SF short story, the one everyone ought to read if they’re only going to read one", and noted that the story "raises a question that everyone who has dealt with the subject [when writing science fiction] since has had to either accept or find a way around", namely "If scientific truths are true for everyone, will we therefore be able to communicate with all scientifically literate cultures using science?" Walton also commended the story's use of gender equality and multicultural characters, with "the only thing that made [her] raise [her] eyebrows" being the constant use of alcohol and tobacco. it focuses on the problem of archaeology on an alien culture.
James Nicoll questioned the basic premise of scientific language being necessarily decipherable — "what if Martian didn't use letters and a numbering system which sounds very akin to ours?" — but overall concluded that the story was "well worth reading." The "Routledge Companion to Science Fiction" similarly faulted this "ideological sleight-of-hand", emphasizing that the "extinct Martian civilization closely resembles the [then-]contemporary US: language is recorded in a linear written form divided into words; the title pages of printed magazines feature the title, month of publication, issue number, and table of contents; Martians live in cities with universities; universities are divided into disciplinary departments — and classrooms — more or less identical to terrestrial ones; and on the wall of the material sciences lab hangs a periodic table of elements, organizing information which might apply universally but which in no way demands graphic representation or public display."
John W. Cowan, inventor of Lojban, praised "Omnilingual" as "one of the best, science fiction stories in which the science is linguistic archaeology", and published a modernized version to his website in 2009.
Stylometric study.
In 2018, Tomi S. Melka and Michal Místecký carried out a complex quantitative analysis of the novelette's style.
Publication history.
Omnilingual has been reprinted several times since its original publication.

Jennifer Allen

Jennifer Allen (born 1961) is an American author and commentator. She has worked for the NFL Network and as an on-air reporter. She is the daughter of football coach George Allen and sister of politician George Allen and football executive Bruce Allen.
Childhood.
Allen grew up the only daughter and youngest child of professional football coach George Allen. She has three brothers. George Allen is a former United States Senator and Governor of Virginia. Bruce was the president and general manager of the Washington Redskins and previously the general manager of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Greg is a clinical psychologist.
Allen's mother came from French Tunisia and was of a Sephardic Jewish background, which became an issue in her brother's 2006 senatorial re-election campaign in Virginia.
Books.
Allen is the author of three books, a collection of short stories, "Better Get Your Angel On" and a memoir, "Fifth Quarter: The Scrimmage of a Football Coach's Daughter", describing her childhood as a coach's daughter and relationship that her family had with the members of the Los Angeles Rams and the Washington Redskins that her father coached; as well as the author of "Hōkūle'a, Mālama Honua, A Voyage of Hope," a chronicle of the worldwide voyage of a Hawaiian sailing vessel, "Hōkūleʻa", which is navigated without modern instruments.
"Mālama Honua" was published by Patagonia, Inc. in 2017. Mālama Honua, which means in "to care for the Earth", Hawaiian, documented the stories of original peoples and environmentalists in countries and island states around the globe. In 2018, the book won the Independent Book Publishers Association Category: Nature and the Environment, Gold Award for non-fiction environmental writing. It also earned Independent Book Publishers Association Silver Award for Coffee Table Book and the Foreword Indies Book Award in the category of Ecology and the Environment.
Pat Conroy called "Fifth Quarter" "the best book about football I've ever read—and Jennifer Allen never played a down in her life." In "The Washington Post", Jonathan Yardley reviewed the book, noting that in writing about her father, she "illuminates his innermost soul and gives us not just a football coach but a human being.”
The memoir contains claims that George held her by her feet over Niagara Falls, struck her boyfriend in the head with a pool cue, threw his brother Bruce through a glass sliding door, tackled his brother Gregory, breaking his collarbone, and dragged Jennifer upstairs by her hair. In the book, she wrote, "George hoped someday to become a dentist...George said he saw dentistry as a perfect profession—getting paid to make people suffer."
In May 2006, Allen qualified some of the claims made in the book. With regards to the pool cue incident, she claimed it was a joke and that "Allen was simply testing her boyfriend's reflexes."
With regards to the dentist quote, Allen claims that the book was a "novelization of the past" and written from the perspective of a young girl "surrounded by older brothers and a larger-than-life father." She claims to have a great relationship with her brother and noted that George walked her down the aisle at her wedding.
Career.
From 2004 to 2010, Allen contributed to the NFL Network as on-air reporter, focusing on the personal lives of coaches and families in the National Football League (NFL).

Undoing Gender

Undoing Gender is a 2004 book by American philosopher and gender studies writer Judith Butler.
Summary.
Butler examines gender, sex, psychoanalysis, and the way medicine and the law treat intersex and transgender people. Focusing on the case of David Reimer who was born male and reassigned to be raised as a girl after a botched circumcision, Butler reexamines the theory of performativity that they originally explored in "Gender Trouble" (1990). David—then renamed Brenda—rediscovers his masculinity and goes on to live his life as a male again. While many of Butler's books are intended for a highly academic audience, "Undoing Gender" reaches out to a much broader readership.
Butler discusses how gender is performed without one being conscious of it, but says that it does not mean this performativity is "automatic or mechanical". They argue that we have desires that do not originate from our personhood, but rather, from social norms. The philosopher also debates our notions of "human" and "less-than-human" and how these culturally imposed ideas can keep one from having a "viable life" as the biggest concerns are usually about whether a person will be accepted if their desires differ from normality. They state that one may feel the need of being recognized in order to live, but that at the same time, the conditions to be recognized make life "unlivable". The writer proposes an interrogation of such conditions so that people who resist them may have more possibilities of living.
Reception.
In a review of the book for "The Comparatist", Atticus Schoch Zavaletta wrote that "Undoing Gender" is the first of Butler's works to address transgender and intersex demographics in a prominent manner, and argued that, in doing so, Butler further "push[es] against the boundaries of the field she had a large part in creating." Zavaletta concluded: ""Undoing Gender" constitutes a thoughtful and provocative response to the new gender politics and elegantly employs psychoanalysis, philosophy, feminism, and queer theory in an effort to pry open the future of the human. Butler carefully attends to contemporary culture, asking questions crucial to LGBTQI studies, ones that are ultimately not only about gays or lesbians but are affirmative of the human and all its possible futures."

David directed the Department of Education, and in 1930 he sponsored a controversial bill which would have created a separate Jewish school board in Quebec.
David did not run in the 1936 election, but was elected again in 1939.
David created the Prix Athanase-David literary prize in 1922. In 1923 was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour by the government of France; he was made an Officer in 1925 and a Commander in 1934.
A sports fan, David was president of the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey club from 1930 to 1935. The club won three Stanley Cups during his tenure in 1924, 1930, and 1931. In 1928 he partnered with Montreal stockbroker Ernest Savard and American baseball executive George Stallings to revive the Montreal Royals baseball franchise as part of the International League and to build Delorimier Stadium.
David resigned from the provincial government in February 1940 to accept an appointment as Senator in the Parliament of Canada where he served until his death in 1953.
1935 ballot controversy.
In the 1935 election, David's victory was contested on the ground that the ballot papers were not printed in the form prescribed under the "Election Act". At the subsequent hearing, the judge ruled that all cast ballots were declared void. Immediately afterwards, the returning officer announced that, as this resulted in a 0-0 tie, he cast his deciding vote in favour of David.
The returning officer's action was considered to have been without precedent anywhere in the world in countries with parliamentary-style legislatures. The Conservatives lodged an appeal, but the result was upheld by the Quebec Court of Appeal in April 1936. David would become the only member of the Assembly in Quebec history to be elected on only one cast vote.
Personal.
David was married to Antonia Nantel (known as Madame Athanase David), who was an arts administrator and patron in Montreal. He helped her in establishing the Montreal Symphony Orchestra in 1934 and the Montreal Festivals in 1936. Their son, Paul David, was a cardiologist and later Canadian senator. His granddaughter is Françoise David.

Lloyd Chapman

Lloyd Alan Chapman (born 1949) is an American lawyer and small business activist. In 2004, he founded the American Small Business League, an advocacy group for which he is chief executive officer (CEO).
Early life and career.
Chapman was born 1949, in Texas. He began his career by working for Texas political leader Bob Bullock and worked for eight years in the Texas Controller's office. In 1986, he relocated to California to pursue opportunities in the computer industry. It was during this period that Chapman became aware of significant challenges in federal small business contracting programs, prompting him to become an advocate for small technology firms. He actively monitored federal "set-aside" contracts for small businesses and his efforts led to a 1991 congressional investigation concerning the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. This investigation resulted in the allocation of an additional $501 million to small and minority-owned firms by the Air Force and Lockheed Martin.
Federal small business contracting and advocacy.
Chapman's work highlighted the requirement for the federal government to allocate a fair portion (currently 23%) of its contracts to small businesses. However, numerous federal investigations and private studies have revealed instances where large companies were inaccurately reported as recipients of federal small business awards. Chapman has persistently pursued litigation to access information regarding small business utilization in government contracts. Notably, in 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled against the Defense Logistics Agency, compelling the release of vital information documenting small business contracting awards. This ruling shed light on the lack of enforcement of congressionally mandated small business goals, paving the way for increased participation of small businesses in federal contracting. 
In 2003, Chapman's contributions prompted a Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigation that confirmed the awarding of small business contracts to some of the world's largest corporations, directly contradicting the Small Business Act of 1953. To advocate for fair policies in federal small business contracting, Chapman established a trade group called the Micro Industry Suppliers Association in 2003. The organization's name was later changed to the American Small Business League in 2004 to accommodate the inclusion of businesses beyond the computer industry.
Noteworthy accomplishments.
In 2006, Chapman achieved several significant milestones through federal lawsuits filed under freedom of information legislation. These lawsuits exposed instances of fraud and abuse in federal small business contracting:
Furthermore, during that year, Chapman:

Taipei Guest House

The Taipei Guest House () is the historical building located at 1 Ketagalan Boulevard, Bo'ai Special Zone, Zhongzheng District, Taipei, Taiwan. It is owned by the Government of the Republic of China and used as a state guest house for receiving state guests or celebration activities.
History.
Designed by Japanese architects and , the structure was built from 1899 to 1901 and rebuilt by in 1911. Gotō Shinpei was responsible for maintaining its construction budget, and was recalled to Japan to meet with National Diet members after it was reported that funds set aside for the Taiwan Grand Shrine were being spent on the Taipei Guest House.
Until 1920, the Taipei Guest House was the residence of the Governor-General of Taiwan during the Japanese period, situated about 100 meters from the Office of the Governor-General of Taiwan (now the Presidential Building). Imperial members and heads of politics often visited here. Emperor Showa (Crown Prince Hirohito) also stayed here when visiting Taiwan. After Taiwan was handed over to the Republic of China, ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs George Yeh and Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Isao Kawada signed the Treaty of Taipei here in 1952.
In 1988, Taipei Guest House was designated by the government of Taiwan and administered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan.
Architecture.
The main architecture of the building is concave shaped, having a roof in Mansard style and high Roman pillars, mainly in a style of French Second Empire palace buildings. Inside the building there is a resplendent suspension light decorated with crystal, baroque gold leaves and flowers and gold foil; outside the building there is a modern Japanese curtilage garden. Taipei Guest House is the representative work of Taiwanese buildings under Japanese rule, also called the most graceful baroque residence house.
Taipei Guest House is open to the public on the first Sunday of even-numbered months from 4 June 2006.
Transportation.

Standardized mortality ratio

In epidemiology, the standardized mortality ratio or SMR, is a quantity, expressed as either a ratio or percentage quantifying the increase or decrease in mortality of a study cohort with respect to the general population.
Standardized mortality ratio.
The standardized mortality ratio is the ratio of observed deaths in the study group to expected deaths in the general population. This ratio can be expressed as a percentage simply by multiplying by 100.
The SMR may be quoted as either a ratio or a percentage. If the SMR is quoted as a ratio and is equal to 1.0, then this means the number of observed deaths equals that of expected cases. If higher than 1.0, then there is a higher number of deaths than is expected. SMR constitutes an indirect form of standardization. It has an advantage over the direct method of standardization since age-adjustment is permitted in situations where age stratification may not be available for the cohort being studied or where strata-specific data are subject to excessive random variability.
Definition.
The requirements for calculating SMR for a cohort are:
Expected deaths would then be calculated simply by multiplying the death rates of the general population by the total number of participants in the study group at the corresponding age group and summing up all the values for each age group to arrive at the number of expected deaths. The study groups are weighted based on their particular distribution (for example, age), as opposed to the general populations's distribution. This is a fundamental distinction between an indirect method of standardization like SMR from direct standardization techniques.
The SMR may well be quoted with an indication of the uncertainty associated with its estimation, such as a confidence interval (CI) or p value, which allows it to be interpreted in terms of statistical significance.
Example.
An example might be a cohort study into cumulative exposure to arsenic from drinking water, whereby the mortality rates due to a number of cancers in a highly exposed group (which drinks water with a mean arsenic concentration of, say 10 mg) is compared with those in the general population. An SMR for bladder cancer of 1.70 in the exposed group would mean that there is {(1.70 - 1)*100} 70% more cases of death due to bladder cancer in the cohort than in the reference population (in this case the national population, which is generally considered not to exhibit cumulative exposure to high arsenic levels).
Standardized mortality rate.
"Standardized mortality rate" tells how many persons, per thousand of the population, will die in a given year and what the causes of death will be. 
Such statistics have many uses:
Mortality tables are also often used when numbers of deaths for each age-specific stratum are not available. It is also used to study mortality rate in an occupationally exposed population: Do people who work in a certain industry, such as mining or construction, have a higher mortality than people of the same age in the general population? Is an additional risk associated with that occupation? To answer the question of whether a population of miners has a higher mortality than we would expect in a similar population that is not engaged in mining, the age-specific rates for such a known population, such as all men of the same age, are applied to each age group in the population of interest. This will yield the number of deaths expected in each age group in the population of interest, if this population had had the mortality experience of the known population. Thus, for each age group, the number of deaths expected is calculated, and these numbers are totaled. The numbers of deaths that were actually observed in that population are also calculated and totaled. The ratio of the total number of deaths actually observed to the total number of deaths expected, if the population of interest had had the mortality experience of the known population, is then calculated. This ratio is called the standardized mortality ratio (SMR). The SMR is defined as follows: SMR = (Observed no. of deaths per year)/(Expected no. of deaths per year).

Ace of Spades HQ

Ace of Spades HQ, Ace of Spades, or AoS is a conservative and humor-driven U.S.-based political blog covering current events, legal issues, military hardware, and salacious topics in popular culture. The blog was first launched in . It has been quoted, mentioned, referenced or linked by "The Wall Street Journal",
Fox News, CNN,
"National Review", "The Weekly Standard", and many notable online magazines/blogs, as well as on the floor of the US House of Representatives. The site's leading blogger, the pseudonymous "Ace of Spades," has also appeared as a guest expert on Fox News, although it is quite rare for him to make media appearances. Current cobloggers include "Buck Throckmorton," "CBD," "J.J. Sefton," "Joe Mannix," "KT," "Misanthropic Humanitarian," "Weasel," "Weird Dave," and several inactive cobloggers.
Public recognition.
When Ace himself was honored as the "Blogger of the Year" at the American Conservative Union's Conservative Political Action Conference in March 2008, Brian Faughnan of "The Weekly Standard" wrote that "Ace has a gift for cutting through political BS, for dissecting the fatal flaws behind liberal arguments, and for doing so with humor. ... [H]e gave an incisive speech on the death of democracy and the rise of tyranny, accompanied by an analysis of how Ronald Reagan re-invigorated the two-party system. Seriously You Guys."
Joy McCann of Little Miss Attila wrote of Ace's speech that "AoS gave a rather thoughtful set of remarks on the why New Media is an important part of policy-making, and drew a straight line between the history of policy debate in a town-hall setting and the Reagan Revolution, which rejected the notion—now so prevalent in Europe and elsewhere—that the political class can consider itself our 'betters,' and simply make policy decisions on our behalf. We have, he reminded us, not simply an opportunity to inform ourselves about politics, but a 'duty' to do so. Naturally, alternative streams of information will play a large role in that process."
In a 2007 editorial for "The Washington Times", editor Tony Blankley described Ace of Spades HQ as a "very smart military blog",
which became a catchphrase at the blog.
Relations with other blogs.
The Ace of Spades HQ is often critical of other political websites, including Andrew Sullivan's "Daily Dish",
the Huffington Post, the Daily Kos,
and Glenn Greenwald's Blog in "Salon". He has also been exceedingly critical of Christopher Buckley, both as a writer of fiction and as a political commentator.
Blogger-in-Chief Ace and Ace of Spades HQ itself have both been quoted and linked extensively at other blogs such as Power Line, Hot Air, Instapundit, Protein Wisdom, and Right Wing News.
Cultural content.
AoSHQ, like many political blogs, links to and comments on the day's news. Unlike some other online commentary sites, however, it often features humorous content in its videos, cartoons, and pictures. The site frequently employs obscenity and vulgar language, setting it apart from most conservative media outlets. One center-right devout Catholic blogger has described the blog and its commenters as "smart but very very vulgar."
Political content.
Ace of Spades HQ was mentioned by Roy Edroso of the left-wing "Village Voice" in the autumn of 2008, in his Guide to the Rightosphere as a "Fratboytarian" new-media outlet. Edroso described the Ace of Spades evolution:

Alathur Venkatesa Iyer

Alathur Venkatesa Iyer (1895–1958) was a teacher of Carnatic music. Venkatesa Iyer practised Carnatic music in the style of the composer Tyagaraja. Venkatesa Iyer later developed a unique style that is known as the "Alathur style" of rendering "kritis". Venkatesa Iyer was also accomplished in playing the harmonium.
Iyer gave the world of Carnatic music its star duo of the 20th century, the Alathur Brothers. This duo consisted of his son, Sivasubramania Iyer, and another student, Srinivasa Iyer of Aangarai near Tanjore. Following the grand tradition set by their guru, the duo excelled in the authentic version of Carnatic music bringing together its technicalities to develop a taste for this patantara in the audience, both the experts and the laymen, alike. Venkatesa Iyer accompanied the Alathur Brothers on the harmonium in their first concert, which was held in 1928 at the Tyagaraja Aradhana at Tiruvaiyaru. Veteran mridangam exponent Pudukottai Dakshinamurthy Pillai accompanied them on the mridangam on that occasion.
Venkatesa Iyer was a Baktha of Saint Tyagaraja and popularized his krithis in large numbers.
Venkatesa Iyer was also a great admirer of Muthuswamy Dikshitar's compositions and he constructed a memorial for the great composer in Tiruvarur where Dikshitar's house had stood.
Venkatesa Iyer was instrumental in bringing out a large number of krithis of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal of Travancore. He shined and polished rare compositions of great composers like Meesu Krishna Iyer of the preceding century. He brought such compositions out on the concert platform through the Alathur Brothers.
Iyer's name is associated with acts such as Kancheepuram Naina Pillai, Konerirajapuram Vaidyantha Iyer, Pudukottai Dakshinamurthy Pillai and Pazhani Muthiah Pillai, all giants of an earlier era in Carnatic music. He sought out the nuances of their music and taught them to his students. The effect of such a training is evident in the music of the Alathur Brothers. A strict disciplinarian and an unflinching traditionalist, he taught students such Sarojini Sundaresan, Trichy J. Venkatraman, Chengelput Ranganathan, Clarinet A. K. C. Natarajan, who though numbering few, have in good stead been the torch bearers of the Alathur style.

Sebastiano Filippi

Sebastiano Filippi (or Bastianino; c. 1536 – 23 August 1602) was an Italian late Renaissance – Mannerist painter of the School of Ferrara.
Biography.
He was born in Lendinara to a painter, Camillo Filippi, who had worked under Dosso Dossi.
He initially likely apprenticed with his father and brother (Cesare Filippi), and is thought to have worked with them when they painted a processional standard "Gonfalone" for the "Oratorio dell'Annunziata" in Ferrara. He left Ferrara, dominated by the likes of Dosso Dossi, Il Garofalo, and Girolamo da Carpi, as a young man to find work in Rome.
In Rome, he is said to have been recommended by Jacopo Bonacossi, the Ferrarese doctor of the Pope, to enter training with Michelangelo. He worked for seven years under the master in Rome, then returned to Ferrara in 1553, where he enjoyed the general patronage of the arts by Duke Alfonso I d'Este and subsequently his son Alfonso II.
He painted a "Madonna with Peter and Paul" for the church of Vigarano. In the Castello Estense, along with his father and brother he frescoed somewhat whimsical depictions of games in the "Salone dei Giochi""Saletta dei Giochi", and "Sala dell'Aurora". He is said to have collaborated with Leonardo Brescia in this assignment. He painted a "Circumcision" and an "Annunciation" for the church of San Agostino, Ferrara.
His 1565 painting, "Birth of the Virgin", recalls the canvas of Andrea del Sarto. He painted large altarpieces for the Certosa of Ferrara, "Vision of Saint Paul" for Massa Lombarda, and "Madonna and Child with Saints and Patrons" in Rovigo in 1565. He painted a fresco of "Last Judgment", highly imitative of Michelangelo, for both the carthusian church St. Christophorus (1578) and for the apse roof of Ferrara Cathedral (1577–1581).
He is said to have become blind late in life. His local prominence by then was shared with the painter Scarsellino. The painter Bartolomeo Faccini is said to have been his pupil in Ferrara, though others assign him as a pupil of Girolamo da Carpi.

WWA Retribution

The Retribution was the fourth professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA). The event took place on December 6, 2002 at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow, Scotland. The event aired in the United States on February 9, 2003 via tape delay.
Eight professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. Lex Luger defeated Sting in the main event to win the vacant WWA World Heavyweight Championship after previous champion Scott Steiner vacated the title due to leaving WWA to join World Wrestling Entertainment. Predominant matches on the undercard were a three-way match between Sabu, Simon Diamond and Perry Saturn and a title defense of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship by Jeff Jarrett against Nathan Jones.
Event.
Preliminary matches.
In the opening match, Shark Boy defeated Frankie Kazarian after performing a "Dead Sea Drop".
Next, Nate Webb was scheduled to compete against Konnan in a match but Perry Saturn attacked him from behind by hitting a Northern Lights suplex, a powerbomb and a Death Valley driver and then applied a "Rings of Saturn" on Webb. Konnan then came and covered Webb for the pinfall and referee rang the bell and counted the pinfall to award the quick victory to Konnan.
Next, Norman Smiley and Malice took on Buff Bagwell and Johnny Swinger in a tag team match. Bagwell and Swinger attacked Smiley before even Malice made his entrance. Malice then joined the match to even the odds. Near the end of the match, Smiley tried to hit a "Big Wiggle" to Swinger but Swinger hit a low blow to Smiley and Bagwell performed a "Buff Blockbuster" on Smiley for the win.
Next, Teo took on Puppet in a hardcore match, with Midajah as the special guest referee. Teo hit a missile dropkick from the second rope and a senton bomb for the win. After the match, Perry Saturn attacked both men and kidnapped Midajah taking her away to the backstage.
Later, new Commissioner Mike Sanders took on Joe E. Legend. Near the end of the match, Legend tried to hit a "Stone Cutter" but Sanders pushed him off and hit a superkick for the win.
This was followed by Jeff Jarrett defending the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Nathan Jones. Jones tried to hit a chokeslam to Jarrett but Jarrett pushed the referee in Jones' way, so Jones picked him up and threw him to the mat, which allowed Jarrett to hit Jones with a guitar for the win to retain the title.
In the penultimate match, Sabu took on Simon Diamond and Perry Saturn in a triple threat match. Teo and Puppet interfered in the match and hit Saturn with Singapore canes but Midajah stopped them, allowing Saturn to attack them. They ripped off Midajah's dress and ran off while Saturn covered Midajah and the two left the match and went to the backstage. Diamond then dived off the top rope but Sabu threw a chair at him and hit a triple jump moonsault for the win.
Main event match.
Sting took on Lex Luger in the main event for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. Near the end of the match, Luger pulled the referee in the way of a "Stinger Splash" attempt by Sting. Jeff Jarrett then interfered by hitting Sting with a guitar. Luger then applied a "Torture Rack" but Sting's foot hit the referee knocking him down again and then Sting countered the "Torture Rack" into a "Scorpion Death Drop". Jarrett then hit Sting with a second guitar, allowing Luger to win the title.
Reception.
"Retribution" received mostly negative reviews from critics. "Crazy Max" staff gave negative reviews on the event and panned the event for Sting's first televised match in eighteen months ending in a loss.
Arnold Furious of "411Mania" gave negative reviews to the event, rating it 4 out of 10 as he wrote "Some of it was alright and main event aside it didn't leave the "WCW" bad taste in the mouth. Some of the one night booking was pretty nonsensical. Like the Midajah situation. It's like a different person booked each one of her segments. I think they were probably expecting Sabu-Diamond-Saturn to be a show stealer but it would have worked better having a triple threat if it was entirely high fliers. Diamond's presence didn't really add to the match. It was one of the more spotty efforts on the night. The other being the opener. Jarrett &amp; Jones did nothing. Sting &amp; Luger did nothing. The formula tag was very bland. It seems like the entire company had no direction. You can understand them struggling a little as their champion got signed by the WWE but hey, it happens. Moving someone up the card was probably the answer rather than drafting in an out of shape Lex Luger to run a match that scraped over seven minutes and still blew up both participants. Thumbs down for this PPV. WWA was only ever really entertaining when it was copying successful achievements from elsewhere and even then it just came off as a second rate rip off."

William Patton (preacher)

William Patton (August 23, 1798 – September 9, 1879), was a pastor, abolitionist, and the son of Revolutionary War colonel and the first Postmaster of Philadelphia Robert Patton. He was the father of the abolitionist William Weston Patton.
Career.
He graduated at Middlebury College in 1818, and, after studying at Princeton theological seminary, was ordained. During twenty-six years of his life he was pastor of churches in New York city. From 1834-37, he was secretary of the American Education Society. He spent the latter part of his life in New Haven, Connecticut, engaged in literary and ministerial work. He was the first to suggest the idea of the World Evangelical Alliance, which he did in a letter to Rev John Angell James, of England, in 1843.
He attended the convention in London in August 1846, that organized the alliance. He was a founder of the Union Theological Seminary, and first proposed its establishment. He made fourteen visits to Europe between 1825 and 1879. He was an earnest opponent of slavery, and for forty years a member of the executive committee of the American Home Missionary Society. His views on the subject of temperance were equally radical.
In the pulpit he was characterized not so much by breadth and accuracy of scholarship, finish of style, or elegance of delivery, as by his strong grasp upon his subject, his simplicity, directness, aptness, and freshness. He received the degree of D. D. from the University of the City of New York.
Publications.
Besides editing President Jonathan Edwards's work on "Revivals" and Charles G. Finney's "Lectures on Revivals" (London, 1839), preparing the American editions of "The Cottage Bible", of which over 170,000 copies were sold, and "The Village Testament" (New York, 1833), and assisting in editing "The Christian Psalmist" (1836), he published "The Laws of Fermentation and the Wines of the Ancients" (1871); "The Judgment of Jerusalem , Predicted in Scripture, Fulfilled in History" (London, 1879); "Jesus of Nazareth" (1878); and "Bible Principles and Bible Characters" (Hartford, 1879).

Sherri Chessen

Sherri Chessen (born 1932), also known as Sherri Finkbine, is an American former children's television host. She is also known as Miss Sherri, her role on the Phoenix version of the franchised children's show "Romper Room". In 1962, Chessen became a subject of controversy when she sought an abortion after discovering that the thalidomide she had been taking caused serious fetal deformities when used in the early stages of pregnancy.
Abortion controversy.
In 1961, Chessen's husband, Bob Finkbine, chaperoned a group of high school students on a European tour, where he purchased over-the-counter sedatives and brought the remainder home. Chessen took 36 of the pills in the early stages of her fifth pregnancy, unaware that they contained thalidomide, which could cause deformity in the fetus. Her physician recommended that she obtain a therapeutic abortion, the only type permitted in Arizona at the time. To publicize the danger of thalidomide, Chessen contacted the "Arizona Republic". Although she was assured anonymity, her identity was not kept secret. The media identified her as "Mrs. Robert L. Finkbine" and "Sherri Finkbine", even though she personally did not use that name.
Following the paper's publication of Chessen's story, the hospital where she planned to have the abortion, wary of the publicity, sought assurance that it would not be prosecuted. When such assurance was not forthcoming, the scheduled abortion was canceled. When her physician asked for a court order to proceed with the abortion, she and her husband became public figures, receiving letters and phone calls in opposition to her requested abortion. A few letters included death threats, and the FBI was brought in to protect her. She also lost her job hosting "Romper Room". Chessen's case was dismissed by Judge Yale McFate, who found that he did not have the authority to decide on the matter.
The controversy became the basis for a made-for-TV movie in 1992, "A Private Matter", with Sissy Spacek in the leading role.
Swedish abortion.
Chessen attempted to go to Japan to obtain an abortion, but was denied a visa by the Japanese Consul. She and her husband then flew to Sweden, where she obtained a successful and legal abortion, which caused a minor controversy. The abortion panel of the Royal Swedish Medical Board granted Chessen's request for an abortion on August 17, 1962, to safeguard her mental health. The operation was performed the following day.
The Swedish obstetrician who performed the abortion told Chessen that the fetus had no legs and only one arm and would not have survived. The doctor stated that the fetus was too badly deformed to identify gender. In 1965, Chessen had another baby, a healthy girl.
Impact.
The termination of Chessen’s pregnancy is seen now as a pivotal event in the history of abortion rights in the United States. According to history professor Mary Frances Berry, her story "helped change public opinion [on abortion]. Fifty-two percent of respondents in a Gallup poll thought she had done the right thing." By 1965, Berry continues, "most Americans, 77 percent, wanted abortion legalized 'where the health of the mother is in danger'"; in that same year, "The New York Times" called for reform of abortion laws. Planned Parenthood wrote that Chessen was able to afford to go overseas to have the abortion, but many other women seeking to terminate unwanted pregnancies would turn to illegal abortions.
Lee Epstein, a professor of law and political science, wrote that "Finkbine’s situation evoked sympathetic reactions from various organizations and, in essence, led to the creation of an American abortion reform movement."
Later.
Chessen has six children from her first marriage with Robert Finkbine. The couple divorced in 1973. Chessen married David Pent in 1991. Pent died in 2002.
From September to December 1970, Chessen had her own one-hour variety show on KPAZ in Phoenix. In the 1990s, she did voice acting for cartoons and wrote two children’s books to address the issues of gun violence and bullying.
After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022 Chessen gave an interview to CBS News Sunday Morning, almost 60 years after her own abortion. In the interview, she characterized herself as pro-choice and anti-abortion, saying that abortions are quite awful, but that "We can't go back to willow sticks and knitting needles and all the things that women have perforated their uteruses with.".

Great fire of Newcastle and Gateshead

The great fire of Gateshead and Newcastle was a tragic and spectacular series of events starting on Friday 6 October 1854, in which a substantial amount of property in two North East England towns was destroyed in a series of fires and an explosion which killed 53 and injured hundreds. There is only one building still extant on the Newcastle Quayside which predated the fire.
Gateshead and Newcastle in 1854.
The towns of Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead sit opposite each other, on relatively steep slopes leading down to the River Tyne. On the north side is Newcastle, the quayside of which was one of the largest in the kingdom, with much shipping and the concentration of the town's business and commerce. Gateshead had similarly dense development opposite the quayside with manufactories, mills and warehouses built down to the water's edge, behind which and running up the hill were numberless densely occupied tenemented dwellings.
The towns were linked by two bridges, built no more than 100 feet (30 m) apart. The older was a nine-arched stone bridge, built in 1771, the third to have been constructed on the site. Slightly upstream was Robert Stephenson's new High Level Bridge, completed five years previously in 1849, an ingenious double-decker design allowing railway traffic on the upper deck and road traffic on the lower.
The worsted manufactory.
On the Gateshead riverbank, a few yards downstream of the old bridge, stood the splendid new mill premises of Messrs. J. Wilson &amp; Sons, worsted manufacturers. This large gaslight-lit building had been erected after a fire which destroyed their previous premises, on the same site, three years before the events of this great fire.
At half past midnight on Friday 6 October 1854, the mill was discovered to be on fire; the cry was raised and immediately the streets crowded with people hurrying to the scene of the growing conflagration. The fire being confined to the upper stories of the building, efforts were made to salvage stock on lower floors; but the great quantities of oil in the premises, used to treat wool, added fuel to the fire and quickly curtailed the attempts. Despite the prompt attendance of the North British and Newcastle fire engines, within an hour the building was one mass of flame and within two the roof fell in and the building was a total wreck.
Bertram's warehouse.
In the immediate neighbourhood of Wilson &amp; Sons was a bond warehouse built twelve years previously by Charles Bertram, and generally known by his name. The building was extensive, reaching to seven storeys, and capable of holding an immense amount of goods. It was at the time used to store thousands of tons of sulphur, nitrate of soda, and other combustibles. It was in part "a double fire-proof structure", with massive metal pillars and every due precaution against fire for the time.
Despite this, from its proximity to the worsted factory, the intense heat caused the sulphur to ignite, melt and stream in a burning blue flame liquidised state from the windows. The authorities, abandoning the mill, sought to save the warehouse, directing all their efforts on it, and were reinforced by the military with their fire engine. This effort was thwarted by the wide scattering of burning brands from the fallen factory roof, which gave additional stimulation to the burning sulphur. By 3 am, the entire warehouse was one body of flames "most awfully magnificent". The sulphurous blaze illuminated the river and its shipping, the High Level Bridge, the Castle, the steeples of All Saints', St. Nicholas' and St. Mary's churches, and every prominent object, with a lurid purple light. From the various floors of the warehouse the sulphur flowed in torrents like streams of lava, and the building resembled "a cataract on fire". Yet at this point the occurrence had borne no aspect other than that of a fearful blaze, a tremendous firestorm sufficiently serious of itself, and altogether unprecedented in the annals of the district.
The explosion.
Such a large fire naturally attracted many spectators, who occupied every spot on the bridges, boats, quayside and surrounding buildings. The fire spread to a wooden staith or jetty used in former times for loading coal, which for a time shared with the warehouse the attention of the thronging multitude.
A slight concussion warned the crowd that there was something more perilous than sulphur alone in the burning pile. A second slight explosion did not warn the firemen and surrounding crowds. A third passed unheeded even.
After a few minutes, the final explosion occurred. The vaults of the warehouse were burst open with a tremendous and terrific explosion, heard away. Vessels on the river lifted as if lashed by a sudden storm. The old bridge shook, and the new quivered. Massive walls were crumbled into heaps, houses tumbled into ruins. The venerable St Mary’s parish church, on the hill in Gateshead, was shattered to a wreck. Gravestones were broken and uplifted. The hands on the dial of its clock stood at ten minutes past three.
Thick black smoke rose as a "pillar of cloud"; temporarily all was silent; and then the scene was lit by falling burning debris from the warehouse, the noise of falling dwellings and then the cries of the injured.
Force of the explosion.
The force of the explosion was immense, and heavy debris was thrown as much as from the seat of the explosion. Huge granite blocks forming the tramway for carts outside the warehouse were flung over the church for two and three hundred yards into neighbouring streets and buildings. One is recorded as falling away through the roof of the Grey Horse pub. A stone of weight damaged property in Oakwellgate. Large blocks of wood and stone were projected widely over Newcastle, reaching the west end of the quayside. The "Courant" newspaper office in Pilgrim Street was hit. A stone weighing fell through the roof of an opticians in Grey Street; when workmen discovered it in the morning it was still too hot to touch. A huge beam of timber, six feet long, was found on the roof of All Saints' Church, Newcastle upon Tyne. Another, ten feet in length and weighing 3 cwt (150 kg) landed on the Ridley Arms in Pilgrim Street; and others on the roof of a house in Moseley Street.
The reverberation of the explosion was heard at North Shields, distant, where residents thought the shock was an earthquake. Gas lights in a Jarrow paper mill were blown out. Light debris from the fire was scattered across of Gateshead and environs. Miners in Monkwearmouth colliery, the deepest in the country and away, heard the explosion and came to the surface, concerned as to the cause. westward at Hexham; north at Alnwick; and south at Hartlepool the explosion was heard distinctly; and for out to sea. The light of the flames could be seen, reflected in the sky, away at Northallerton. And whilst the report of the explosion travelled so far, people on the scene were insensible of it. They describe themselves as having been lifted from their feet and dashed down, the violence completely stunning them; and when they awoke in a stupor they had only the dim idea of a rolling sound in their ears.
The explosion crater was measured to have a depth of , and a diameter of .
The Newcastle fires.
The projectile power of the explosion scattered burning debris widely across Newcastle; and the blast peeled off roofs as if to receive this flaming rain. One hundred yards of street frontage—offices, shops and warehouses—were in a short time in flames, the conflagration running up the hill, Butcher Bank, to Pilgrim Street. A second conflagration, in a triangle bounded by Pilgrim Street, Butchers Bank and George's Stairs took hold. The entire combined strengths of the local fire brigades had been directed on the Gateshead properties and were, besides, buried beneath the rubble. So quickly did the fire move through the packed buildings that it was impossible to put out.
View from the High Level Bridge.
The High Level Bridge provided an excellent elevated platform for observation of the twin fires, as they extended in Gateshead and Newcastle; the lower portions of the towns "took on the aspect of a burning cauldron". A mass of onlookers thronged the lower bridge watching the flames which rose from left and right, towering up and leaping from house to house, lane to lane, street to street.
Emergency response.
The fires, from hour to hour progressed rampantly, irresistibly bearing down everything which came within range of their power, checked only providentially. The authorities moved, throughout, with all speed at their disposal, directed by the two Mayors, with assistance from men of the councils; members of the Board of Guardians; two fire brigades, and officers and men of the local garrison.
As soon as the area's telegraph wires, damaged by the explosion, could be made good, calls for assistance went out to the surrounding towns and cities. Fire engines were sent by the most expeditious means from Durham, Hexham, Carlisle, Morpeth and Berwick. Floating fire engines from Shields and Sunderland were dispatched, as were another three engines from the latter town. Owing to the serious injury to the military of Gateshead, detachments were sent from Tynemouth, Sunderland and Carlisle, which arrived by the earliest trains. This combined effort through the early course of the day appeared to be checking the progress of the flames.
Renewal of the Gateshead Fire.
After noon, a renewal of the conflagration on the Gateshead side arose as a stream of blazing sulphur made its way east along the riverbank, setting light to Mr. Davidson's flour mill, which had hitherto merely been ruined by the explosion. It was quickly alight, and for several hours afterwards the fire travelled east from building to building. This mass of buildings was still alight at midnight, at which point the flames were licking at St. Mary's church; but this was saved by heroic effort. In the emergency, it was resolved to demolish by explosion some of the already shattered houses to the east of the fire to form a firebreak, a task quickly accomplished by parties of sappers and miners. By this means, and by the action of the powerful floating engines, the fire was confined and at length consumed and extinguished.
Effects: the ruins.
The High Level Bridge once more provided a first-class platform for the observation of the effects of the explosion and fire. Looking east from it the eye could span the whole sphere of devastation, taking in the still-smoking wreckage of property levelled to the ground.
Besides the less serious damage to property in the outskirts of the town, the force of the explosion left its marks in blown off roofs, thrown down walls and gable ends, broken staircases, shattered doors, demolished windows, framework and sashes, making complete havoc of properties it did not entirely destroy. So widespread was the damage that scarcely a house in the lower and middle part of Newcastle escaped unscathed. On Sandhill, nine out of every ten shop fronts was blown in. In The Side, Dean Street, Mosely Street, Collingwood Street, Grey Street, Market Street, Pilgrim Street and even in Clayton Street west, the same effects were to a considerable extent observable. In Gateshead the same effects were produced in Pipewellgate, Bridge Street, Church Street, Bottle Bank, Canon Street, Oakwellgate and streets beyond.
The area was thronged as if on a fair day, throughout Friday and for the rest of the weekend. It is estimated that 20,000 people arrived by train on Saturday; special trains were laid on, running every hour.
Loss of life and injury.
The scale of injury and loss of life was smaller than might be imagined from such an infernal night. Some 53 people were accounted as having died, including Alexander Dobson, the 26-year-old second son of the renowned Newcastle architect John Dobson; Charles Bertram, owner of the exploding warehouse; and William Davidson, scion of the mill-owning family. Figures for the injured are less reliable, but it is supposed that from 400-500 people were injured, some horribly, and many receiving treatment at the Gateshead Dispensary and the Newcastle Infirmary. At the latter hospital, the beds of the existing in-patients were given to the newly injured, and the existing in-patients—where able—tended the new charges in their beds, under the direction of the medical staff.
Two hundred families "of the poorer classes" were burned out of their houses; amongst which were several orphans and widows. Each was calculated to have lost, on average, £15 of property.
Benevolent efforts.
A single benevolent fund was established, though the greater number of sufferers was on the Gateshead side. Gateshead Council commenced the collection with a donation of £600, and opened a subscription list for donors. Newcastle Council held a public meeting in the Guildhall and opened a list, headed by the Mayor, who donated £100; subscriptions from those at the meeting passed the £1000 mark. Queen Victoria contributed £100, and later, on a visit to Balmoral had the royal train stop on the High Level Bridge so she could observe the damage. The inhabitants of Alnwick succeeded in raising £300, including a donation of £100 from the Duke of Northumberland; several other towns contributed in a similar liberal way. The Bishop of Durham subscribed £150, the Earl of Carlisle £200, and so on, down to collections from workmen and the militia.
Upwards of £11,000 were subscribed and no less than eight hundred families applied for assistance from the funds. Altogether £4,640 was paid for the loss of furniture. In February, 1857, the benevolent fund committee stated that they had expended £6,533, and reserved £3,044 for widows and orphans, with the remainder of the fund distributed to the Newcastle Infirmary, £1,190; Gateshead Dispensary, £314; Ragged Schools, £195; other charities, £50.
Property destroyed.
In Gateshead, beside the less serious damage to windows and property generally, all that part of the town from the Church and Church Walk to the river, lying east of Bridge Street and comprising Hillgate was more or less destroyed. The whole of Canon Street, situated on the south side of St. Mary's Church was a mess of ruins. The houses on Church Walk were so shattered and demolished as to be no longer safe for human habitation. As to properties on the waterfront, the following were destroyed:
Banks of tenement housing on the hill behind the mill and warehouse were variously levelled, greatly damaged and consigned to the flames.
On the Newcastle side:
The estimated loss, calculated some months after the event, and taking account of foregone rents, was not less than £500,000. Much of the property was insuredwell in excess of £130,000 of claims were documented to have been made within the year, with more private insurance claims going unrecorded in the official history. Equally, many firms and individuals were uninsured or underinsured.
Judicial enquiry.
Two inquests were held into the events, one on the Gateshead side and the other on the Newcastle side. The main points of consideration for both were the causes of the fire, and the cause of the explosion. Lord Palmerston, the Prime Minister appointed one Captain Ducane of the Royal Engineers to attend on the government's behalf, and dispatched Alfred Swaine Taylor FRS to investigate the chemical causes of the explosion.
The inquest juries found that no direct evidence as to the origin of the fire was presented. Mill hands responsible for various of the upper floors gave testimony that at the end of the day, all gas lights had been extinguished, and the gas supply isolated at a main tap; no cause was suggested and no progress made in this line of enquiry. The Gateshead jury found that there must have been "some want of caution displayed" at the mill to occasion the fire.
Evidence in respect of the explosion was of more interest. A statement of the contents of the warehouse was given, the most interesting features of which were 2800 tons of sulphur and 128 tons of nitrate of soda. These goods lay on various floors, and in the vaults, arranged so that in the event of a destructive fire, they might mix. Evidence given suggests that there were no other obvious candidates as fuel for the explosion; no oils, no naphtha nor oils of vitriol. Great lengths were taken, including the posting of a reward for information, to ascertain whether gunpowder was stored in the warehouse; but all evidence pointed against it. A number of chemists, including the government chemist, tested residues found on the scene, as well as black dust which fell on the spectators, looking for the remains of combusted gunpowder; but none was found.
A mixture of sulphur and nitrate of soda is not considered to be explosive, although the addition of carbon to the two forms black powder.
Two scientific theories were advanced to explain the cause of the explosion. Hugh Lee Patterson, a partner in a chemical company at Felling and Washington examined the evidence and ran tests; and offered a theory that a sudden water inundation onto burning sulphur would have had sufficient energy to cause the explosion. His theory, meticulous in its calculations, estimated that of water would have been necessary, having a power equivalent to 8 tons of gunpowder. However no satisfactory mechanism was advanced for the sudden ingress of such an amount of water, amounting to a couple of tons. Neither were victims of the explosion scalded, as might have been anticipated.
Professor Taylor offered a gas theory of the explosion, in which he contended that deflagration would cause a pressure of gas to build up sufficiently quickly in the vaultsthe entrance to which was small and through the roofto cause the explosion. The difficulty with this explanation was in believing that the vaults were well enough sealed as to result in an explosion, when a more gradual forcing up of the cellar roof might more reasonably be anticipated.
The Gateshead jury found that the explosion was caused by the interaction of sulphur and nitrate of soda, but were unable to determine a mechanism. They did make the recommendation that the two should not be stored together in future. They found a complete want of evidence for gunpowder.

Seille (Saône)

The Seille () is a river originating in the Jura mountains in France. It is a left tributary of the Saône, joining it in the commune of La Truchère, in Saône-et-Loire. It is long.
The river's headwaters are in the "reculée" (blind valley) of Ladoye-sur-Seille, approximately 8 km south of Poligny. It is joined by the "Seille de Beaume", that springs in the blind valley of Baume-les-Messieurs, in Nevy-sur-Seille. From there it crosses the vineyards of the Jura department, irrigating the communes of Nevy-sur-Seille, Voiteur, and Arlay, before reaching the agricultural plain of Bletterans. It then passes Louhans and the Bresse area in the department of Saône-et-Loire, finally flowing into the Saône at La Truchère, a few kilometers south of Tournus. Near its mouth, the Seille forms a 3047 hectare network of ponds, dunes, and bogs, providing a habitat for a large number of migratory birds, including endangered species and rare plant species.
The upper part of the Seille is a tranquil trout stream that sometimes overflows its banks in the spring. The lower part, also prone to substantial flooding, is navigable for 39 kilometers from Louhans to La Truchère; there one can find catfish that have inhabited the river since the 1960s and that occasionally become very large. The river is known for, in the 1980s, having the largest catches of catfish in France (record: 2.20 m, 66 kg).
"Nothing much happens on the Seille and that is its special charm. It runs through a closed-in, rolling countryside with few villages and little else along its banks but fields, trees and cows. It carries hardly any traffic, has only four tired old locks and is wonderfully free of the disturbance from road or rail that often shatters the peace in other places. The Seille is a place apart, isolated from the noisy world around it, almost forgotten and little known". Hart Massey, "Travels with Lionel: A Small Barge in France" (1988), pg. 151.
The Seille catchment area covers 2300 km², containing some 600 km of watercourses in three departments: Jura, Saône-et-Loire, and Ain; it is thus located in three administrative regions. A river contract for the Seille basin was put in place by the Saône and Doubs Mixed Syndicate in 2002, with financial assistance from regional and general councils, the Water Agency, and the State. The contract concerns water quality and the flooding of residential areas, which can affect more than thirty communes: the three most affected regions being the Louhans metropolitan area, Bletterans, and Voiteur.
The Solnan and the Sâne Vive are among its tributaries.

Audubon School District

"For the school district in Iowa, see Audubon Community School District"
The Audubon Public School District is a comprehensive community public school district that serves students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade from Audubon, in Camden County, in the southern portion of the U.S. state of New Jersey.
As of the 2023–24 school year, the district, comprised of four schools, had an enrollment of 1,366 students and 135.4 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 10.1:1.
The district participates in the Interdistrict Public School Choice Program, which allows non-resident students to attend the district's school without cost to their parents, with tuition covered by the State of New Jersey. Available slots are announced annually by grade.
Students from Audubon Park attend the district's schools as part of a sending/receiving relationship established after Audubon Park closed its lone school in 1979. For grades 9–12, students from Mount Ephraim attend Audubon High School, as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Mount Ephraim Public Schools.
History.
The two elementary schools in Audubon, Haviland Avenue School and Mansion Avenue School, had both served Kindergarten to sixth grade. This continued until the 2009-2010 school year when they were reconfigured so that Haviland is PreK-2 and Mansion was reconfigured to serve grades 3–6.
The district had been classified by the New Jersey Department of Education as being in District Factor Group "DE", the fifth-highest of eight groupings. District Factor Groups organize districts statewide to allow comparison by common socioeconomic characteristics of the local districts. From lowest socioeconomic status to highest, the categories are A, B, CD, DE, FG, GH, I and J.
Schools.
Schools in the district (with 2023–24 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are:

Core members of the district's administration are:
Board of education.
The district's board of education is comprised of nine members who set policy and oversee the fiscal and educational operation of the district through its administration. As a Type II school district, the board's trustees are elected directly by voters to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with three seats up for election each year held (since 2012) as part of the November general election. The board appoints a superintendent to oversee the district's day-to-day operations and a business administrator to supervise the business functions of the district.

Castello Estense

The ('Este castle') or ('St. Michael's castle') is a moated medieval castle in the center of Ferrara, northern Italy. It consists of a large block with four corner towers.
History.
On 3 May 1385, the Ferrarese people, driven to desperation by taxes and flooding that had brought ruin upon them, took themselves to the Marquis Niccolò II d'Este's palace to ask the advice of Tommaso da Tortona, the high official held to be responsible for this grave situation. Nicolò tried to calm the revolt all day, but by the evening it was clear that the people's spirits were getting more and more angry and that the very safety of the Estensi was endangered. The order was therefore given to summon the disgraced Tommaso, who was given confession and communion and then given to the crowd, who literally tore him to pieces.
This episode, which resulted later in the death of the leaders of the revolt, convinced the Marquis that the family's palace (which is now the Palazzo Comunale) was insufficient to guarantee the security of the nobility in the event of riots. He therefore ordered the construction of a defensive fortress on the north side of the Palazzo, entrusting the project to the architect Bartolino da Novara. He used a pre-existing tower (the Torre dei Leoni), which was part of the defensive walls, at that period very much to the south of the present ones, running, roughly speaking, along the line of the present Corso Giovecca and Viale Cavour. The tower was joined by curtain walls to another three newly built for this project. Between the Este residence and the new fortress was built an aerial passageway (perhaps in wood) to allow people to flee from one to the other.
As the city grew the city walls were moved, so the defensive function of the castle became less important and apartments began to be built in its interior, which was by now considered an annex to the court palace. From the time of Ercole I d'Este on, there are many records of construction of apartments, and of their enlargement and enhancement. The definitive transformation works were ordered by Ercole II after a fire in 1544, which had damaged the previous accommodation. The architect Girolamo da Carpi gave the castle the external appearance which can be still seen today, although the interior has been remodelled several times across the ages. After the departure of the Este to Modena, the castle became the residence of the Papal Legate who administered the Ferrarese territory as civil governor (for a maximum term of four years). There were few changes made to the structure of the building, the most obvious being the increase in height of the north ravelin (the room which currently houses the cafeteria).
In 1860 Ferrara was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy. The castle, now state-owned, was bought for 70,000 liras in 1874 by the Province of Ferrara that utilized the structure as headquarters of the Prefecture. In the subsequent decades, the castle underwent many small restoration projects, especially between 1910 and 1930, when some very questionable attempts were done. During World War II it was severely damaged by Allied aerial bombing, thus it was partially reconstructed in 1946.
In 2002, at the initiative of the Provincial administration, the "Castle for the City" project was started: it involved a massive, €2.7m restoration of the castle and a series of exhibition of international significance, such as: "The Triumph of Bacchus: Masterpieces From the Ferrara School at Dresden", inaugurated in 2002 by the then President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, and "A singular Renaissance: the court of Este in Ferrara", inaugurated in 2003 at the Centre for Fine Arts of Brussels and later in Ferrara at the presence of the then President of the European Commission Romano Prodi. In 2004 the whole project of restoration was completed with two significant events: the inauguration of the €1.7m new museum display ideated by archistar Gae Aulenti and the restoration and temporary opening to visitors of the Camerini d'Alabastro ("alabaster cabinets"), secret rooms built by Alfonso d'Este.
Following the 2012 Northern Italy earthquakes, one of the towers partially collapsed and underwent restoration works.
Exterior.
On the outside, the castle essentially presents the appearance given to it by Girolamo da Carpi in the second half of the 16th century. Surrounded by a moat, it has three entrances with drawbridges fronted by brickwork ravelins. The fourth entrance, to the east, was removed to make room for the kitchens.
At the bottom, the appearance of the building still recalls a mediaeval fortress, but higher up, da Carpi replaced the battlements with elegant balconies in white stone (resting on series of corbels), making it higher again by constructing a higher storey, covered by a skew roof. The towers were improved and made more graceful with roof terraces.
The courtyard, nowadays fairly austere, was frescoed. In particular, at the top were portraits of all the ancestors (real and legendary) of the Este family: the only ones surviving, considerably damaged but still discernible, have been detached and placed under the portico on the east side of the courtyard.
The wells were to provide water in time of drought; the round stone balls that are seen about the place are ammunition for catapults.
Ground floor.
Gothic Rooms.
The Gothic Rooms are series of four evocative living rooms with cross-vaulted ceilings. The first is certainly the most beautiful, with rich decorations of clusters of flowers running along the ribs of the vault. The room is dedicated to Nicolà II d'Este (his portrait stands out facing the entrance), who built the castle. At the centre is found a magnificent reconstruction in wood of the castle in the early years of its existence. The three following rooms are dedicated to the Marquises Alberto, Niccolò III and Leonello, and finally Borso, the first duke of the dynasty. A series of panels illustrates the political and cultural life of the period.
Kitchens.
The east ravelin of the castle was enlarged and used to house the court kitchens. The first of the two rooms, long and narrow, shows signs of the two distinct functions, military and civil, that it had over the course of time: opposite the entrance can be seen a chimney pipe from the kitchen, while along the inside walls are found arrow-slits for archers, some walled up so as to be nearly useless. In the second room, much bigger and lighter, some stoves have been reconstructed. On one wall is seen the portrait of Cristoforo di Messisbugo, the most famous of the Este's 'Scalcos' – the Scalco was the official who supervised many of the practical aspects of court life, organised spectacles, directed the kitchens, and readied things whenever necessary for moves to and from the family's country residences, etc.
Dungeons.
Shortly after entering a narrow corridor, on the left the low deep doorway that leads into the Don Giulio's dungeon, once allotted for a cell and perhaps also a torture chamber. Notably Giulio d’Este was shut up in this cell for many years; he was the legitimate brother of Alfonso I and the lead actor in a famous and unhappy affair. Going back onto the corridor that goes around the cell, a steep and narrow stairway leads to the cells that held the unlucky lovers Ugo and Parisina. Parisina Malatesta was the second wife of Marquis Niccolò III, who was something of a rake and a great deal older than her. After seven years of marriage that had been generally quite calm, she ended up falling in love with her stepson Ugo, son of the Marquis and Stella dei Tolomei, and he with her. The two young people were discovered, subjected to a rapid trial and finally beheaded. It was 1425; Parisina was 20 years old, Ugo only 19. Coming down the stairway, on the left was Parisina's cell. Following the corridor is Ugo's one, having, on the ceiling, prisoners' writing done with candle smoke.
Lion's Tower.
Before 1385, since at least one hundred years, on the site where the Castle of Saint Michael was built, an old watchtower stood to defend the northern line of the city walls and, more exactly, the near strategic gate called of the Lion, beyond which a small homonymous district extended. A large canal, that flew into the river Po with its tributaries, defended the northern stretch of walls. At that period the town had developed alongside the left bank of the main branch of the river, whose course in that point opened eastward to form a vast delta. Water provided places, suburbs and the town itself with the most effective protection. Not very long before the construction of the Castle, the watchtower underwent a transformation, ordered by Nicolò II and probably carried out by the same Bartolino da Novara, who would both later have been the future patron and architect of the Castle. Thus, from a high, rectilinear square-planned tower, intended for surveillance and sighting, it turned into a small fort with a much wider base and larger battlements on the first floor, well-equipped according to the latest military defensive techniques. A ramp, that ran along three sides of the stronghold, allowed access to the battlements and was meant to facilitate transport of weapons, artillery and other such loads with the help of animals. The vast rooms at the ground and first floors were used as headquarters for the Este soldiery, whereas the prisons were located in the dark basement. The exterior structure of the stronghold looked the same on all four sides.
First floor.
The Courts.
The Courts have several rooms with remains of frescoes and panels describing the different apartments of the castle.
Loggia and Garden of the Oranges.
The Garden of the Oranges assumed its current size and characteristics under Alfonso I and evokes powerfully the presence of the court, standing here unseen by the people, amid the perfume of the orange blossoms, admiring the city. The wall of the hanging garden was constructed following the plans of Girolamo da Carpi. Archive documents are rich in observations about the hanging gardens and these have allowed the reconstruction of their various arrangements: from little paths among large flowerbeds (whose soil had been carried up here) of annual plants, to the 18th century arrangement, which featured only citrus plants, in pots that were sheltered in the winter in a Loggia used as a greenhouse.
Cabinet of the Bacchanalia.
This is a little passageway that was at one time completely painted; the right-hand wall still shows three scenes inspired by the myth of Bacchus.
Ducal Chapel.
The Ducal Chapel is a little room with elegant geometric lines, destinated to private praying. An old tradition argued that Renée de France – wife of Duke Ercole II of Este who had Calvinist sympathies – ordered this particular decoration, without sacred images. On the walls, coated all over with precious polychrome marbles, no sacred image – either painted or in mosaic – is actually represented, as one would at least expect in the small niches. The vault, conversely, is decorated with frescoes portraying the Four Evangelists against a light blue background, surrounded by cherubs, each of them respectively recognizable by the lion (Saint Mark), the eagle (Saint Luke), the angel (Saint Matthew) and the bull (Saint John) in accordance with the iconographic tradition.
Chamber of Dawn.
Located inside the Lion's Tower, the Chamber of Dawn is decorated with a sumptuous ceiling representing the four parts of the day: on the right (coming in from the chapel) is the Dawn, a young winged Goddess who advances pulling the horses of the sun's chariot by their reins. Proceeding then in a clockwise direction is the Day, when the chariot of the sun proceeds in all its shining glory, preceded by Dawn with two torches in her hands; then the Dusk, with the chariot of the sun going away towards the horizon; and Night, where Diana, with the lunar disc on her forehead, rejoins her lover Endymion. At the centre is an old man representing the Time, seated between the three Fates – Goddesses of Life and Death. In the lower part is a long procession of cherubs on chariots drawn by every type of animal. The great mirrors that are a feature of this room and the two following were set there by the curator of the restoration, Gae Aulenti, recalling the name of these rooms, recorded in documents as "The Mirror Suite".
"Saletta dei Giochi".
The "Saletta dei Giochi" ("Small Chamber of Games") has a ceiling decorated, in the centre, with the round dance of the Four Seasons, and around that frescoes with scenes of the Games of Ancient Rome; on the long side a Bacchanal; opposite that the Basket Fight, a sort of boxing in which the competitors had around their hands bandages called 'baskets'. On the two short walls are represented Gladiator fights. At the bottom, scenes of children's games rendered in the artistic style of Ancient Rome. From the "Saletta dei Giochi" it's possible to climb right up to the balustrade of the Lion's Tower, from which it is possible to enjoy a good panoramic view of the city of Ferrara.
"Saletta dei Veleni".
The "Saletta dei Veleni" ("Small Chamber of Poisons") seems to have been used originally by the court pharmacists to produce medicine and, according to some, also the poisons used against political enemies. The ceiling is from the 20th century and represents Italy surrounded by symbols of conquest from the fascist period.
The Hall of Games.
This large room was intended for evening amusements, whether concerts or games. The ceiling is divided into eleven panels, each one containing a scene describing a different sport, following the passions of Duke Alfonso II. Not all of them are painted in the same style: the ones on the courtyard side are by Bastianino and represent, from left to right: the all-in wrestling, the "lancio delle pietre" (a kind of discus throw performed with stones), and the Greco-Roman wrestling. The athletes are naked in deference to the tradition of ancient Greece. Also, by Bastianino is the panel depicting swimming, on the short side next to the Greco-Roman wrestling.
"Appartamento della Pazienza".
At one time this was the first room of the "Appartamento della Pazienza" ("Patience Suite"), made for Ercole II. Its decoration is late, with a neo-Renaissance ceiling; at the edge are represented the signs of the Zodiac. The room is dominated by an enormous reproduction of an 18th-century panorama of Ferrara by Andrea Bolzoni.
Gallery anteroom.
The neo-Renaissance ceiling displays some of the Este coats of arms. The space is dominated by a large panel that reproduces an antique print showing Ferrara at the end of the 15th century, when the architect Biagio Rossetti had started the enlargement of the city ordered by Ercole I (the "Addizione Erculea") and the new walls had already been built to the North, with the old walls still awaiting demolition. The still navigable Po is in foreground position. At the end of the main piazza (on the right the cathedral, on the left the Palazzo Ducale, behind which are poking out the towers of the Castle), is portrayed a gate which closes it off, while behind the built-up areas the old walls can be seen. Higher up is a second circuit of walls, surrounding a thinly populated area.
Hector and Andromache Room.
This room was created by shortening the Gallery. In the 19th century Cardinal Tommaso Benetti had the ceiling decorated with an epic scene: Hector leaving his son and his wife Andromache (Iliad Book VI). The large panel reproduces a fresco with a representation of Estense territory: the Duchy of Ferrara at the centre, with Modena and Reggio on the left.
Gallery Room.
All that remains of that large chamber has lost all trace of decoration. Originally on the walls there were frescoed views of the city. The panels are dedicated to the countryside residences of the House of Este for retreat and pleasure. The large panel shows the Ferrara region during the Napoleonic era.
The land reclamation projects.
This room is dedicated to the works of land reclamation that characterized the territory of the Province of Ferrara along the centuries.
Saint Paul's Tower.
The Saint Paul's Tower was built on the South-west corner of the Castle as the stronghold to the building's main entrance. The tower points towards the site upon which the church of San Giuliano was re-built (visible from the windows). The little church was demolished in 1385 to allow the construction of the new building, and for this reason the tower is now sometimes referred to as the tower of San Giuliano. The wall designs in tempera are dedicated to images of Diana and other divinities, whereas on the ceiling, between large sections supporting light architectural structures, the four seasons are illustrated in small panels.
Government anteroom.
Those who requested audience with the Duke waited in this little room. The ceiling is richly frescoed. The floor is from the Este period.
Government Room.
Created for Ercole II (1534–1559) to deal with the business of government, it still displays its splendid original ceiling with painted and gilded lacunars (recessed panels), one of the most beautiful in this style in the whole of Italy. In the centre, in the large oval, is represented the Myth of Pan. Other Mythical forms are found in the other panels: the whole should be read as a celebration of the Prince and his good government.
Devolution Room.
The ceiling, dating to the 19th century, represents the devolution of Ferrara from the House of Este domination to that of the Papal States in 1598. The four pictures are to be read clockwise, starting from the side nearest the Sala del Governo: in the first one, Lucrezia d’Este, sent by the Duke of Ferrara, is conversing with Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, the Pope's nephew; in front, two secretaries are drawing up the Agreement which was then to be signed by these two plenipotentiaries. In the second, Duke Cesare d'Este, surrounded by dignitaries, leaves the city he has lost, on horseback, bound for Modena, which he had declared the new capital of his State. On the third, Cardinal Aldobrandini arrives in Ferrara the day after the Duke's departure. In the fourth, finally, one of the many festivities organised in honour of Pope Clement VIII, come to take possession of the city: in the castle moat, ladies from Comacchio race the typical boats of the lagoons, the "batane".
Landscapes Room.
This room takes its name from the band decorated with fine landscape frescoes, painted in the 18th century by an unknown hand (perhaps Giuseppe Zola).
Geography Room.
Situated in the Torre Marchesana, otherwise called the Clock Tower, this hall has noteworthy maps of Ferrara territory created in 1709–1710. The enormous area once covered by water and marshes has for mostly disappeared today, in the wake of the great land reclamation works that were concluded in the 1930s.
Coats of Arms Room.
The room displays two series of decorations from the Papal States period. The older is a long series of coat of arms with the Papal tiara and the Keys of St. Peter; one part is taken up with the coats of arms of the Popes from Clement VIII (1592–1605) to Pius VI (1775–1799), the others are empty. Beneath this is a decoration with the coats of arms of the Cardinal Papal Legates who had their residence in the castle: some are visible on the upper part of all four walls. The lower part is however occupied by a decoration made in 1857 on the occasion of the visit of Pope Pius IX, which completely hid the earlier paintings. More coats of arms and some views of the Ferrarese territory of that time: the city of Ferrara (the Castle), Comacchio (the Trepponti), Cento (the main square), Lugo di Romagna (the porticoes), Pomposa Abbey and Bagnacavallo.
Council Room.
In 1919 when the First World War ended, an ambitious restoration project was started that had been under discussion since 1916. The works included the decoration, furniture and lighting of the Council Room. This room bears witness of developments of the liberty into Art Deco design that can be seen in the ornate oriental-like painting on the ceilings, in the mirroring of ceramic mosaics featuring the coat of arms of the city of Ferrara, in the panel with emblems of poppies waving among the wheat that surround the Province's coat of arms above the president's chair. This same emblem is repeated on one of the six doors, whereas, on the others we find eels amidst waves and seaweed, squirrels on blossoming branches, swallows in vineyards, woodcocks in the marshes and dragonflies and butterflies amidst the corn.

Pentewan Railway

The Pentewan Railway () was a narrow gauge railway in Cornwall, England. It was built as a horse-drawn tramway carrying china clay from St Austell to a new harbour at Pentewan, and was opened in 1829. In 1874 the line was strengthened for locomotive working. It finally succumbed to more efficient operation at other ports and closed in 1918.
Origins.
Tin mining had been the dominant industry in much of Cornwall in the eighteenth century, but that work was declining by the 1830s. China clay (referred to as kaolinite outside the United Kingdom) had been discovered in the area north and west of St Austell, in Cornwall, and Charles Rashleigh was prominent in developing the industry; he built a harbour at Charlestown from which the material could be shipped to market. The harbour was south-east of St Austell town and the principal sources of the mineral were to the north west, and that the china clay had to be conveyed on packhorses through the centre of the town.
In 1820 Sir Christopher Hawkins purchased land at Pentewan at the mouth of the St Austell River. He constructed a harbour there, and it was completed in 1826 at a cost of £22,000.
In 1827 a prospectus for a railway was published by him; the railway was to run from the West Road at St Austell to Pentewan Harbour; the West Road location was on the cartage route from the clay pits. Tenders for the construction of the line were invited on 26 September 1829. There were no substantial engineering difficulties and the line was announced as already open nine months later, on 1 July 1830; the cost was said to be £5,732 6s 8d. Hawkins appears to have managed the operation through a Pentewan Railway and Harbour Company.
The line in operation.
The new railway was built to narrow gauge. There had previously been no other edge railway of that gauge. It was the third public railway in Cornwall, after the Portreath Tramroad (a plateway) and the Redruth and Chasewater Railway. The northern part was on a steep gradient falling towards the harbour, so that loaded wagons could be gravitated; the remainder, and the uphill empty haul, was operated with horses.
Output of china clay in Cornwall increased rapidly at this time, from 12,790 tons in 1826 to 20,784 tons in 1838. The Pentewan Railway handled about a third of the traffic at first, but this declined to about a tenth in 1838.
In 1833 a coal yard and siding were built at London Apprentice to serve the tin mine at Polgooth. In time the line serviced a number of small mica works and other industries along the line, including the St Austell gas works, for which it provided coal. Coal was also brought in to the mica kilns, as well as to St Austell. Baltic timber was also taken from Pentewan to St Austell for making barrels.
Passengers.
There appears to have been a limited passenger service on the line from 1830, but few details survive. An early account quotes the fare as 3d. There was no formal timetabled train service, and it is likely that persons were conveyed on an ordinary wagon on request. A sixteen-seat saloon carriage was built in 1875, but its use was confined solely to the Hawkins family.
 In August 1881 the children of St Austell Workhouse, were taken to Pentewan on the trucks for their annual treat, which was paid for by Mr Arthur Coode. From 1883 free Sunday School excursions to Pentewan took place, and these appear to have become a regular event on the line. The passenger were conveyed in the clay wagons
1874 improvements.
While the line had originally been a pioneer, technological progress meant that lines built later were more efficient. The Cornwall Railway opened between Plymouth and Truro in 1859 using steam locomotives, and soon became the dominant land transport medium in the district. Silting of Pentewan Harbour had been a recurrent problem, limiting its attractiveness to shipping.
In 1874 an Act of Parliament was obtained authorising the use of locomotive traction on the Pentewan line, and also extensions northwards into the china clay fields. This ambitious scheme changed the name of the owning company to the "St Austell and Pentewan Railway Harbour and Dock Company" with capital of £50,000. Strengthening of the track had apparently already taken place, and indeed the use of locomotives had already been implemented: an 0-6-0 tender engine, "Pentewan" had arrived in 1874. 
On 1 January 1876 the Cornwall Railway was taken over by the Great Western Railway and the larger company directed china clay traffic to its harbour at Fowey, providing better facilities and a more efficient transport link from connected china clay pits. The impact on the Pentewan traffic was dramatic; carryings fell from 19,672 tons in 1876 to 5,341 tons in 1877. The £50,000 capital of the expanding Pentewan company had only been "authorised" by Parliament, and few subscribers came forward with the money: by 1880 only £11,824 had been forthcoming by 1880, and profits from current operations were inadequate to pay the ground rent.
An 1884 assessment.
Symons summarised the story of the line, writing in 1884; implementation of locomotive traction seems to have met with objection:
The St. Austell and Pentewan Railway, made about 50 years ago, was for the conveyance of goods only. It was intended, recently, to work it by locomotives, but the opposition of Mr. Hawkins, a landowner, prevented it. Its chief use is for the conveyance of china clay to Pentewan.
Electrification proposed.
This collapse seems to have been followed by a boom, for in 1882 45,270 tons were carried, generated a profit of £1,206. This buoyancy enabled the replacement of the original locomotive "Pentewan" with a new, similar, machine, named "Trewithan" in 1886. At the same time there were renewed proposals to extend the line northwards and to electrify it, using a central live rail.
This seems a huge leap of faith: at the time only Volk's Electric Railway (1883) and the narrow gauge railways at the Giant's Causeway Tramway (1883) and the Bessbrook and Newry Tramway (1885) had been equipped with electric traction systems. The electrification scheme and the proposed extensions were not implemented.
The twentieth century.
The line carried 20,694 tons in 1903; always susceptible to fluctuations in the china clay trade outside its own control, the line suffered with the slump following that year, but increased its carryings again, so that by 1910 34,123 tons were carried.
The locomotive Trewithan was replaced by a "Canopus" in 1901. A further locomotive, "Pioneer", was acquired second hand from the War Department in 1912. The locomotives only worked up as fas as Iron Bridge; horses were used for the final section in St Austell on grounds of public safety. The horses were brought up from Pentewan on the first train of the day; locomotive operation into St Austell was permitted in later years.
A strike in 1913 reduced earnings and the outbreak of war in 1914 took many men away from the china clay industry; the reduced output was increasingly diverted away from Pentewan which suffered from limitations of primitive handling methods and difficult navigational access, and the last china clay was carried on 29 January 1918; the last actual train ran on 2 March 1918.
The track gauge of was used to service the trenches at the front in France, and the track and locomotives were acquired by the War Department.
Personnel.
From 1887 to 1913, the driver and fireman was a father and son team. The fireman, J. H. Drew wrote a detailed account of life working on the Pentewan railway.
Remains.
In 2006, there are few remains of the old railway system: a set of complete points are still in situ outside an old engine shed.
An unusual weigh bridge is also still in existence although being overgrown. There is now a cycle- and footpath which follows the route of the railway

National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program

The Office of Special Masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, popularly known as "vaccine court", administers a no-fault system for litigating vaccine injury claims. These claims against vaccine manufacturers cannot normally be filed in state or federal civil courts, but instead must be heard in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, sitting without a jury.
The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP or NVICP) was established by the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), passed by the United States Congress in response to a threat to the vaccine supply due to a 1980s scare over the DPT vaccine. Despite the belief of most public health officials that claims of side effects were unfounded, large jury awards had been given to some plaintiffs, most DPT vaccine makers had ceased production, and officials feared the loss of herd immunity.
Between its inception in 1986 and May 2023, it has awarded a total of $4.6 billion, with the average award amount between 2006 and 2020 being $450,000, and the award rate (which varies by vaccine) being 1.2 awards per million doses administered. The Health Resources and Services Administration reported in July 2022 that "approximately 60 percent of all compensation awarded by the VICP comes as result of a negotiated settlement between the parties in which HHS has not concluded, based upon review of the evidence, that the alleged vaccine(s) caused the alleged injury". Cases are settled to minimize the risk of loss for both parties, to minimize the time and expense of litigation, and to resolve petitions quickly.
National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services set up the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) in 1988 to compensate individuals and families of individuals injured by covered childhood vaccines. The VICP was adopted in response to concerns over the pertussis portion of the DPT vaccine. Several U.S. lawsuits against vaccine makers won substantial awards. Most makers ceased production, and the last remaining major manufacturer threatened to do so. The VICP uses a no-fault system for resolving vaccine injury claims. Compensation covers medical and legal expenses, loss of future earning capacity, and up to $250,000 for pain and suffering; a death benefit of up to $250,000 is available. If certain minimal requirements are met, legal expenses are compensated even for unsuccessful claims. Since 1988, the program has been funded by an excise tax of 75 cents on every purchased dose of covered vaccine. To win an award, a claimant must have experienced an injury that is named as a vaccine injury in a table included in the law within the required time period or show a causal connection. The burden of proof is the civil law preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, in other words a showing that causation was more likely than not. Denied claims can be pursued in civil courts, though this is rare.
The VICP covers all vaccines listed on the Vaccine Injury Table maintained by the Secretary of Health and Human Services; in 2007 the list included vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), polio, hepatitis B, varicella (chicken pox), "Haemophilus influenzae" type b, rotavirus, and pneumonia. From 1988 until January 8, 2008, 5,263 claims relating to autism, and 2,865 non-autism claims, were made to the VICP. Of these claims, 925 (see previous rulings), were compensated, with 1,158 non-autism and 350 autism claims dismissed, and one autism-like claim compensated; awards (including attorney's fees) totaled $847 million. The VICP also applies to claims for injuries suffered before 1988; there were 4,264 of these claims of which 1,189 were compensated with awards totaling $903 million. As of October 2019, $4.2 billion in compensation (not including attorneys fees and costs) has been awarded.
, filing a claim with the Court of Federal Claims requires a $402.00 filing fee, which can be waived for those unable to pay. Medical records such as prenatal, birth, pre-vaccination, vaccination, and post-vaccination records are strongly suggested, as medical review and claim processing may be delayed without them. Because this is a legal process most people use a lawyer, though this is not required. By 1999 the average claim took two years to resolve, and 42% of resolved claims were awarded compensation, as compared with 23% for medical malpractice claims through the tort system. There is a three-year statute of limitations for filing a claim, timed from the first manifestation of the medical problem.
Autism claims.
More than 5,300 petitions alleging autism caused by vaccines have been filed in the vaccine court. In 2002, the court instituted the Omnibus Autism Proceeding in which plaintiffs were allowed to proceed with the three cases they considered to be the strongest before a panel of special masters. In each of the cases, the panel found that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a causal effect between the MMR vaccine and autism. Following this determination, the vaccine court has routinely dismissed such suits, finding no causal effect between the MMR vaccine and autism.
Many studies have failed to conclude that there is a causal link between autism spectrum disorders and vaccines, and the current scientific consensus is that routine childhood vaccines are not linked to the development of autism.
Several claimants have attempted to bypass the VICP process with claims that thimerosal in vaccines had caused autism, but these were ultimately not successful. They have demanded medical monitoring for vaccinated children who do not show signs of autism and have filed class-action suits on behalf of parents. In March 2006, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that because the NVICP only protected vaccine manufacturers from liability, and thimerosal was not itself a vaccine, plaintiffs suing three manufacturers of thimerosal could bypass the vaccine court and litigate in either state or federal court using the ordinary channels for recovery in tort. This was the first instance where a federal appeals court has held that a suit of this nature may bypass the vaccine court. The argument was that thimerosal is a preservative, not a vaccine, so it does not fall under the provisions of the vaccine act. The claims that vaccines (or thimerosal in vaccines) caused autism eventually had to be filed in the vaccine court as part of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding.
The scientific consensus, developed from substantial medical and scientific research, states that there is no evidence supporting these claims, and the rate of autism diagnoses continues to climb despite elimination of thimerosal from most routine early childhood vaccines. Major scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization, as well as governmental agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC reject any role for thimerosal in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.
Compensation awards.
As of May 2023, nearly $4.6 billion in compensation and $450 million in attorneys’ fees have been awarded.
The following table shows the awards by main classes of vaccines made to victims in the years 2006-2017.
 This shows that on average 1.2 awards were made per million vaccine doses. It also shows that multiple vaccines such as MMR do not have an abnormal award rate.
Attorneys fees and costs.
Self representation is permitted, although the NVICP also pays attorneys fees out of the fund, separate from any compensation given to the petitioner. This is "to ensure that vaccine claimants have readily available a competent bar to prosecute their claims".
Homeland Security Act.
The Homeland Security Act of 2002 provides another exception to the exclusive jurisdiction of the vaccine court. If smallpox vaccine were to be widely administered by public health authorities in response to a terrorist or other biological warfare attack, persons administering or producing the vaccine would be deemed federal employees and claims would be subject to the Federal Tort Claims Act, in which case claimants would sue the U.S. Government in the U.S. district courts, and would have the burden of proving the defendants' negligence, a much more difficult standard.
Petitioner's burden of proof.
Notably, the Health Resources and Services Administration reported in July 2022 that "approximately 60 percent of all compensation awarded by the VICP comes as result of a negotiated settlement between the parties in which HHS has not concluded, based upon review of the evidence, that the alleged vaccine(s) caused the alleged injury". Cases are settled to minimize the risk of loss for both parties, to minimize the time and expense of litigation, and to resolve petitions quickly.
Of the remaining cases, in the vaccine court, as in civil tort cases, the burden of proof is a preponderance of evidence, but while in tort cases this is met by expert testimony based on epidemiology or rigorous scientific studies showing both general and specific causation, in the vaccine court, the burden is met with a three prong test established in "Althen", a 2005 United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruling. "Althen" held that an award should be granted if a petitioner either establishes a "Tabled Injury" or proves "causation in fact" by proving three prongs:
This ruling held that tetanus vaccine caused a particular case of optic neuritis, even though no scientific evidence supported the petitioner's claim. Other rulings have allowed petitioners to gain awards for claims that the MMR vaccine causes fibromyalgia, that the Hib vaccine causes transverse myelitis, and that the hepatitis B vaccine causes Guillain–Barré syndrome, chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multiple sclerosis. In the most extreme of these cases, a 2006 petitioner successfully claimed that a hepatitis B vaccine caused her multiple sclerosis despite several studies showing that the vaccine neither causes nor worsens the disease, and despite a conclusion by the Institute of Medicine that evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship.
In 2008, the federal government settled a case brought to the vaccine court by the family of Hannah Poling, a girl who developed autistic-like symptoms after receiving a series of vaccines in a single day. The vaccines given were DTaP, Hib, MMR, varicella, and inactivated polio. Poling was diagnosed months later with encephalopathy (brain disease) caused by a mitochondrial enzyme deficit, a mitochondrial disorder; it is not unusual for children with such deficits to develop neurologic signs between their first and second years. There is little scientific research in the area: no scientific studies show whether childhood vaccines can cause or contribute to mitochondrial disease, and there is no scientific evidence that vaccinations damage the brains of children with mitochondrial disorders. Although many parents view this ruling as confirming that vaccines cause regressive autism, most children with autism do not seem to have mitochondrial disorders, and the case was settled without proof of causation.
With the commencement of hearings in the case of "Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services" (Case #98-916V), the argument over whether autism is a vaccine injury moved into the vaccine court. A panel of three special masters began hearing the first cases of the historic Omnibus Autism Proceedings in June 2007. There were six test cases in all, and the entire record of the cases is publicly available. The lead petitioners, the parents of Michelle Cedillo, claimed that Michelle's autism was caused by a vaccine. Theresa and Michael Cedillo contended that thimerosal seriously weakened Michelle's immune system and prevented her body from clearing the measles virus after her vaccination at the age of fifteen months. At the outset Special Master George Hastings, Jr. said "Clearly the story of Michelle's life is a tragic one," while pledging to listen carefully to the evidence. On February 12, 2009, the court ruled in three test cases that the combination of the MMR vaccine and thimerosal-containing vaccines were not to blame for autism. Hastings concluded in his decision, "Unfortunately, the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment." The ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, and upheld.
On March 13, 2010, the court ruled in three test cases that thimerosal-containing vaccines do not cause autism. Special Master Hastings concluded, "The overall weight of the evidence is overwhelmingly contrary to the petitioners' causation theories."

The World's Greatest Athlete

The World's Greatest Athlete is a 1973 American sports comedy film directed by Robert Scheerer and starring John Amos, Roscoe Lee Browne, Tim Conway, Dayle Haddon, and Jan-Michael Vincent. Released by Walt Disney Productions, it is one of the few wide-release Hollywood sports films to look at the world of track and field. In the film, two coaches Sam Archer (Amos) and Milo Jackson (Conway) make use of jungle boy Nanu (Vincent) and have him make history by winning every event at the NCAA Track &amp; Field Championship. The screenplay was by Dee Caruso and Gerald Gardner who also did a novelisation of the film. This film was also one of Billy De Wolfe's final roles before he died the following year.
Plot.
Sam Archer and his assistant Milo Jackson are coaches at Merrivale College. They have lost every game in every sport which they have coached, raising the concerns of Dean Maxwell, the head of the Alumni Association. With only one year left on his contract, Archer decides that he is in need of a vacation. Together, Archer and Jackson head to Zambia in Southern Africa.
While out on a safari, the pair catch sight with their guide Morumba of the Tarzan-like jungle boy named Nanu, who can outrun a cheetah in full bound. Seeing this, the coaching staff quickly whip out their recruitment pen and papers, but soon fall (literally) into the clutches of Nanu's godfather, spiritual leader Gazenga. Because Nanu is an orphan and an innocent child of the bush, Gazenga believes that throwing Nanu into the world of competitive United States college athletics would interfere with his spiritual development.
Despite Gazenga's concerns, the ambitious coaches persuade Nanu to join the Merrivale College program as Nanu brings his pet Bengal tiger Harry with him. From this point forward, the plot is driven by a combination of slapstick and suspense, for Nanu's destiny as the "World's Greatest Athlete" will annoy several powerful people who are used to getting their way.
Nanu's innocence, Archer's scheming, Jackson's ineptitude, Gazenga's outraged wisdom, and the Machiavellian plotting of the villains all play roles in the action as the film heads toward the final track meet. The atmosphere of American competition does indeed threaten Nanu, but he is saved from disintegration by love interest Jane Douglas. Jane and Nanu's budding relationship angers rival Leopold Maxwell, whose attempts to sabotage the budding star build toward a crescendo as the ultimate competition approaches. The climactic track meet is peppered with commentary by ABC-TV sportscaster Howard Cosell. After his victory, Nanu decides to return home, accompanied by Jane and Harry, and Archer and Jackson bid him farewell at the airport.
In the final scene, a framing device is shown where Archer and Jackson are depicted trying to recruit a new athletic phenomenon that resides in China.
Cast.
The film also features many prolific athletes and sports journalists in small or cameo roles, including Howard Cosell, Frank Gifford, Jim McKay, Bud Palmer, Joe Kapp, and Bill Toomey.
An unidentified Bengal tiger actor was used to portray Harry, Nanu's companion and pet who he brings with him from Africa to California. As tigers are not native to Africa, Nanu explains to Archer and Jackson that Harry emigrated from India to Africa as a cub.
Production.
Much of the film was shot at University of the Pacific and San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton, California, and in the Newhall neighborhood of Santa Clarita, California. The track scenes were filmed at California State University, Los Angeles. The live-action jungle scenes were shot at Caswell Memorial State Park, on the Stanislaus River outside of Ripon, California.
Release.
The film opened on February 1, 1973 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. It opened on February 7 in Los Angeles and then expanded on the 14th.
Home media.
"The World's Greatest Athlete" was released on VHS in October 1986 by Walt Disney Home Video, and by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on March 18, 1997. The film was also released on DVD on August 2, 2005. As of March 2024, the film had not appeared on the Disney+ streaming service (unlike the majority of Disney's catalogue titles), for reasons unknown.
Reception.
Critical response.
Upon the film's release, A.H. Weiler of "The New York Times" wrote: "It's a dream that is more often simple-minded than simple and generally as hilarious as finishing fourth in the mile run. It should be stressed, however, that this ribbing of the Tarzan myth runs a good, clean course that should grab all red-blooded sports fans up to and including the 14-year-old group. It might be added that everyone from coach Amos to Jan-Michael Vincent, in the title role, athletically tries without much success to make all this good-natured nonsense funny."
Box office.
The film opened with a disappointing $125,000 in its first week in New York but was one of the most popular releases of 1973, earning $10,600,000 in theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada that year.

Raffy Tulfo

Rafael Teshiba Tulfo (; born March 12, 1960) is a Filipino politician, broadcast journalist, and media personality who has served as a senator of the Philippines since 2022. 
His works are focused on government and private sector issues, and he is best known as the host of the long-running public affairs radio program "Wanted sa Radyo", and the former anchor of "Aksyon sa Tanghali" from 2014 to 2020 that featured the segment "Ipa-Raffy Tulfo Mo". His YouTube channel "Raffy Tulfo in Action", which features videos from both shows, is the third-most subscribed Filipino YouTube channel as of 2021. Tulfo sought a seat in the Philippine senate in the 2022 election and won placing third overall with 23 million votes. Tulfo serves as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Senate Committee on Migrant Workers.
Early life.
Rafael Teshiba Tulfo was born in Quezon City on March 12, 1960. He is the son of Ramon Tulfo Sr., a colonel in the Philippine Constabulary, and Caridad (née Teshiba), a housewife, who died in 2024, at the age of 97. He is the eighth out of ten siblings which includes Tuchi, Bong, Joseph, Edelle, broadcasters Ramon, Ben, Erwin, as well as former tourism secretary Wanda Corazon Teo. Tulfo would describe his family as middle class.
A college dropout, Tulfo spent four years in different universities and studied several majors including economics, political science, agribusiness and commerce but did not finish a degree before becoming a journalist.
Broadcast career.
Tulfo is associated with TV5. Although he would start his broadcasting career with the People's Television Network (PTV).
Tulfo's first television program was "Philippines' Most Wanted" which aired from 1995 to 2002. He co-hosted it with Nina Taduran. The program was produced by his uncle and aunt. It was with "Most Wanted" when Tulfo began to be referred to as "idol".
He would be known for the radio broadcast program "Wanted sa Radyo" as well in YouTube for "Raffy Tulfo in Action" (RTIA).
Political career.
Tulfo would endorse the ACT-CIS Partylist for the 2019 House of Representatives elections, with the organization managing to garner three seats in the lower house. He himself in August 2019, has initially stated that he had no plans to enter politics as a candidate in the 2022 elections insisting that he is satisfied in his current situation and would focus on "public service".
On October 2, 2021, Tulfo would change his mind and filed his certificate of candidacy for senator as an independent candidate for the 2022 senatorial election. On February 8, 2022, he joined the senatorial slate of presidential candidate Manny Pacquiao. Tulfo finished in third place, receiving 
23,396,954 votes, and was proclaimed as Senator on May 18, 2022. Tulfo was later elected as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy.
Senate of the Philippines (2022–present).
At the start of the 19th Congress in July 2022, Tulfo filed his priority bills which include protecting Filipino workers from abusive employers and providing discounts for poor job applicants. He also filed a bill amending the Anti-Violence Against Women and Children Act to protect all family members from violence. Amid rising electricity rates in Mindanao and other parts of the Philippines in August 2022, Tulfo called for a Senate investigation into the rotational blackouts in the country and filed a Senate resolution seeking to avert the imminent energy crisis.
In 2023, Tulfo filed a bill legalizing and regulating the underground importation of "ukay-ukay" second-hand products which already evolved as part of Filipino culture. He later filed a bill mandating all providers of critical infrastructure services such as power generation and distribution, water supply, healthcare, transportation, communications, and financial services to respond within two hours from the time of emergency service requests. He also filed a bill establishing security monitoring systems such as CCTV cameras in all prison cells to ensure the safety of inmates and prison personnel. Between February and April, Tulfo filed Senate resolutions seeking to probe reports of bullying within the hospital hierarchy, investigate reported delays of the Social Security System in processing retirement and death claims of its members, conduct an inquiry into reported inhumane treatment of patients and possible corruption at the National Center for Mental Health, and investigate "arrogant and condescending" government employees which he says are creating "an atmosphere of fear and mistrust" in government institutions. Amid several power outages in Luzon and growing tension between the Philippines and China in May 2023, Tulfo filed a senate resolution investigating the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines to verify if it poses a threat to national security for being 40 percent owned by the State Grid Corporation of China.
Potential 2028 presidential bid.
In regards to a potential 2028 presidential bid, Tulfo's brother Erwin in April 2024 insist that Raffy does not want to run for the position. Raffy Tulfo would affirm the lack of interest, requesting survey organizations to "exclude his name" in opinion polls for the upcoming vote and people to support the incumbent administration of President Bongbong Marcos out of courtesy.
Controversies.
From 1996 to 1999, Tulfo wrote a series of articles in his "Abante Tonite" column alleging anomalous and illegal activities by officials of the Bureau of Customs. Tulfo, together with publisher Allen Macasaet and managing editor Nicolas Quijano Jr., were charged with libel by customs lawyer Carlos So on April 12, 1999. On February 28, 2005, the Pasay City Regional Trial Court found Tulfo, Macasaet and Quiano guilty of 14 counts of libel and were sentenced to up to 32 years of imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of total. On June 29, 2021, the Supreme Court acquitted Tulfo of the libel charges.
On March 24, 2004, Tulfo published an article in his "Abante Tonite" column accusing businessman Michael Guy of seeking help from former finance secretary Juanita Amatong to halt a tax fraud investigation by the Department of Finance’s Revenue Integrity Protection Service (RIPS). The claim was proven false, however, as the RIPS only investigates government officials and did not have jurisdiction over Guy. On February 24, 2010, the Makati Regional Trial Court convicted Tulfo and seven representatives from "Abante"'s publisher of libel and were ordered to pay a total of to Michael Guy for damages and attorney's fees. In July 2019, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction and increased the amount of damages needed to be paid.
In January 2007, Tulfo and his brothers Ramon and Erwin, each posted bail after a Quezon City Regional Trial Court judge issued warrants for their arrests following a libel complaint by then-first gentleman Mike Arroyo. The brothers had previously accused Arroyo of using his influence to force the government-sequestered station RPN to cancel their investigative news program "Isumbong Mo! (Tulfo Brothers)." On July 16, 2007, the libel case against the brothers was dismissed.
In June 2014, Tulfo again posted bail for an arrest warrant issued by the Quezon City Regional Trial Court after Senior Police Officer III Abubakhar Manlangit filed a libel case against him and his brother Erwin. The policeman, who appeared in a November 15, 2011, episode of "," also filed an MTRCB complaint against the brothers after being called a "thief" on air which contributed to a 20-day suspension of the program.
On April 18, 2022, Tulfo's Senate bid faced a disqualification case due his conviction for the crime of libel.
In 2023, the "Daily Tribune" reported that Raffy Tulfo has been a product endorser of the 1UP brand by Superbreakthrough Enterprises, a company which the Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a cease and desist order for illegally soliciting investments. Tulfo's camp has reasoned that his endorsement is on assuring the quality of 1UP products rather than the operations of Superbreakthrough.
Personal life.
Tulfo is married to Jocelyn Pua, the incumbent representative for ACT-CIS Partylist since 2019. They had two wedding ceremonies – at the Office of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court in Luna, Isabela on June 24, 1993, and at the Little Quiapo restaurant in Quezon City on January 20, 1995. Together, they have two children and one grandson. His daughter Maricel (born 1992) also hosts his programs "Wanted sa Radyo" and "Idol in Action". His son Ralph Wendell (born 1996) is the incumbent representative of the 2nd district of Quezon City since 2022.
Julieta Nacpil Licup claimed that she and Tulfo married on October 25, 1982, at a civil wedding in Capas, Tarlac with supporting evidence and they have one daughter named Grendy, born in 1984. In addition, Julieta also claimed that Tulfo left her when she was five months pregnant with their child because of a misunderstanding. Because they were not able to communicate with each other thereafter in 1984, Julieta thought that Tulfo was dead and filed paperwork within the Philippine courts with evidence of her attempts at finding him. The courts approved her petition to his presumptive death and she was able to remarry an American in 1992. As a result, Tulfo was sued for bigamy on June 10, 2019, as their marriage was not annulled. She also claimed that Tulfo also married another woman named Celedonia Amos in the United States in 1985. He also faced a disqualification case before Commission on Elections given those claims of his past marriages, but was later junked by the Commission's 2nd division because it "does not pertain to his qualification for elective office."

Mysore Vasudevachar

Mysore Vasudevacharya (28 May 1865 – 17 May 1961) was an Indian musician and composer of Carnatic music compositions who belonged to the direct line of Tyagaraja's disciples. Vasudevachar's compositions (numbering over 200) were mostly in Telugu and Sanskrit. Some of his most popular kritis include Brochevarevarura in Khamas raga, "Devadideva" in Sunadavinodini, "Mamavatu Sri Saraswati" in Hindolam, "Shankari Ninne" in Pantuvarali, "Bhajare Re Manasa" in Abheri and "Ra Ra Rajeevalochana Rama" in Mohanam.
 He presided over Madras Music Academy's annual conference in 1935, when the Sangeetha Kalanidhi award did not exist. But everybody who presided over the annual conference in the 1930s was later conferred the award. He was a recipient of the civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan.
He is credited with two writings in Kannada, one of them an autobiography called "Nenapugalu" (memories) and "Na Kanda Kalavidaru" (the musicians I have met) in which he wrote the biographies of many well known musicians. Mysore Vasudevachar also taught in Rukmini Devi's Kalakshetra, (founded in 1936). He was already quite old by then, but thanks to Rukmini Devi he agreed to shift to Kalakshetra. He became the chief musician in Kalakshetra and helped in setting the Ramayana to music. He died in 1961 at the age of 96. He lived a simple and austere life devoted to the study of Sanskrit and music.
S. Rajaram, his grandson, worked at Kalakshetra, eventually taking charge of the institution at Rukmini Devi's request. Vasudevachar had composed the music for only the first four kandas and it was left to Rajaram to finish the work. An accomplished musician and Sanskrit scholar, he was amongst the few musicians, the sole repository of Vasudevacharya's compositions. S. Krishnamurthy (1922–2015), his other grandson worked at All India Radio and translated his Vasudevachar's memoirs into English. He has also published a memoir of his own.
Early life.
Vasudevacharya was born in an orthodox Madhwa Brahmin family in Mysore and started learning music from Veena Padmanabhiah, the chief musician of the Mysore court. He also mastered Sanskrit and allied fields such as Kavya, Vyakarana, Nataka, Alankaram, Tarka, Itihasa, Purana having studied at the Maharaja Sanskrit college in Mysore while learning music privately.
He then went on to learn from the famous composer-musician Patnam Subramania Iyer supported by the Maharaja's generous stipend and imbibed the music of not only his Guru but also other great maestros of the Thanjavur-Cauvery delta. Vasudevacharya eventually became the chief court musician (Asthana Vidwan) at the Mysore court. He was known for his madhyama-kala tanam singing which he learnt from his Guru. Patnam Subramania Iyer often requested his sishya "Vasu" to help him with the sahitya (lyric) aspects of his compositions. This aspect of his training undoubtedly helped Vasudevacharya as a composer. He was adept in all the aspects of Carnatic music especially Ragam Alapanam, Tanam, Neraval and Kalpanaswaram.
Career.
He published a large number of his compositions in the book "Vasudeva Kirtana Manjari". His compositions in Telugu have such sweetness and lilt, and beautifully blend with the tune of the raga as do the Sanskrit compositions, which are mellifluous. His songs reflect his mastery of Sanskrit and show his erudition and scholarship in Sanskrit literature. He considered his insight into Telugu as a gift from Tyagaraja (Tyagaraja's bhiksha). Unlike the Dasa kuta songs, his compositions don't have any Dvaita undertones but many have the words "Paramapurusha Vasudeva" or "Vasudeva" which means the supreme Vasudeva/Lord Vishnu which incidentally is also his mudra or signature.
True to his Vaishnava heritage and the Thyagaraja shishya parampara to which he belonged, most of his compositions are in praise of Lord Rama. In addition to Kritis and Keertanas, he also composed Varnams, Thillanas, Javalis and slokas. His admiration for the trinity of Carnatic music specially Thyagaraja resulted in "Srimadadi Thyagaraja Guruvaram" in Kalyani, "Shri Ramachandra" (a ragamalika) and two other ragamalikas in praise of Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Sastri. Vasudevachar's compositions are thus like sugar candy which gives one instant pleasure and yet lingers on in the mind and heart long after.

List of MPs elected in the 1754 British general election

This is a list of the 558 MPs or members of Parliament elected to the 314 constituencies of the Parliament of Great Britain in 1754, the 11th Parliament of Great Britain.
The candidates returned in contested elections are listed in the descending order of the number of votes received.
The Tory versus Whig party division, which had originated in the Exclusion Bill debates in the seventeenth century, was almost extinct by 1754. Whilst some members were still identifiable as being of a Tory or Whig persuasion, few contested elections turned on party cries. The hotly contested Oxfordshire and Reading elections were amongst the few where party in the old sense mattered at all and 1754 was the last such election in those areas. Identification by party in the list below is therefore of limited significance, particularly as to the future loyalties of the politician concerned.
For what it is worth the government electoral manager, Viscount Dupplin, reported to the Whig Prime Minister (Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle) that the outcome of the election was Administration 368, Tory 106, Opposition Whig 42 and doubtful 26.
Peers of Ireland are differentiated from the holders of courtesy titles by including the succession number to the peerage, i.e. "The 1st Earl of Upper Ossory" is an Irish peer and "Viscount Dupplin" is the holder of a courtesy title.

Geoffrey Bardon

Geoffrey Robert Bardon AM (1940, Sydney – 6 May 2003) was an Australian artist and school teacher who played a significant role in the development of the Western Desert aboriginal art movement.
Bardon studied law for three years at the University of Sydney, before changing to study art education at the National Art School in Sydney, graduating in 1965. He taught art at various New South Wales country high schools before taking up a posting in 1971 to teach at the primary school at Papunya, a remote Aboriginal settlement 250 km west of Alice Springs.
After encouraging the children to record their sand patterns in paint, he went on to encourage the adult men of the community to paint their Honey Ant Dreaming on the school wall, preserving their traditional Dreamings, or Tjukurpa, and stories in paint. Eric Michaels comments on this in his essay "Bad Aboriginal Art": "... [directed by Bardon, the elders] began to interact with certain issues in 1960s and 70s international painting, especially the extreme schematisation of New York minimalism." Bardon, however, claimed non-intervention. Michaels went further to say that arguably the choice of materials (acrylic paint) was also an influencing factor.
The artistic movement unleashed at Papunya spread over Central Australia and has since achieved international acclaim. Bardon experienced many difficulties in his time in the desert, due to the indifference, neglect and criticism of government departments towards his work – the Honey Ant Dreaming mural painted by the Aboriginal elders was painted over with white paint by the authorities. Eventually, Bardon suffered a nervous breakdown and upon his return to Sydney underwent a period of deep sleep therapy with the controversial psychiatrist Harry Bailey, which left him weakened.
Bardon worked closely with the Aboriginal painters who became the founders of the Papunya Tula painting movement during 1971 to 1973, and devoted many years after this to documenting and promoting the Aboriginal art which he so admired.
He was survived by his wife Dorn and their sons, James and Michael.
Recognition.
In the 1988 Australia Day Honours, Bardon was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia: "in recognition of service to the preservation and development of traditional Aboriginal art forms".

Renato Augusto

Renato Soares de Oliveira Augusto (born 8 February 1988) is a Brazilian professional footballer who last played as a midfielder for Campeonato Brasileiro Série A club Fluminense. From 2011 to 2018, he played for the Brazil national team, scoring six goals in thirty-two appearances.
Club career.
Flamengo.
Renato was hailed as one of the best products of Flamengo's youth academy in recent years, and had been close to a deal with Palermo in 2007. His style of play, combining decisive passes with good control of the ball, pace and dribbling efforts led him to being capped for Brazil at under-20 level; his career with Flamengo had nevertheless been plagued by injuries.
Bayer Leverkusen.
Renato signed for German Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen for an unknown fee, though thought to be €10 million, 60% of which was retained by Flamengo; the remaining 40% were owned by the Traffic and MFD investment groups, that paid €1.5 million each for a share in Renato Augusto's transfer fee, earlier in 2008.
Renato made an immediate impact, becoming one of the fan favorites very quickly with his swiftness, awareness, teamwork, and his technical abilities. Despite usually playing on the right side, with Leverkusen, he began playing in the hole, just behind the striker.
Despite being plagued with injury in the 2010–11 season, just like the previous ones in Germany, Augusto maintained stellar form, scoring on three occasions in one-goal lead victories. On 13 March, he scored a memorable goal where he scored a match-winner in 82nd minute against Mainz 05, giving Bayer Leverkusen a valuable victory, and vaulting them into the title race.
Corinthians.
On 20 December 2012, Bayer Leverkusen confirmed that Renato would leave for Corinthians for a reported fee of €3.5 million. In 2014, after being properly diagnosed and treated, he played 44 games in the year, and in 2015, he was awarded the Bola de Ouro (Golden Ball) for leading Corinthians to the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A title.
Beijing Guoan.
On 6 January 2016, Renato joined Chinese club Beijing Guoan for a reported fee of €8 million. On 16 March 2016, Augusto made his Guoan debut in a 0-0 away draw at Tianjin TEDA, and scored his first goal for the club on 17 April in a 3-0 away win against Hangzhou Green Town. On 11 March 2018, he captained Guoan for the first time in a 2-1 away win against Jiangsu Suning. On 25 August 2018, he scored his first hat trick for the club in a 5-2 away win against Tianjin TEDA. On 30 November 2018, he captained Guoan to win the 2018 Chinese FA Cup after a 2-2 away draw (aggregated 3-3 draw, Guoan won on away goals) against Shandong Luneng, the club's first major trophy in 9 years. On 20 April 2019, he made his 100th appearance for Beijing Guoan in a game against Hebei China Fortune.
Return to Corinthians.
On 22 July 2021, after terminating his contract with Beijing Guoan, Renato returned to Corinthians, signing a deal until 31 December 2023.
At the end of the 2023 season, Corinthians announced Renato's departure from the club.
Fluminense.
On 5 January 2024, Renato signed a two-year contract with Série A club Fluminense.
International career.
Renato debuted with the senior national team in a away friendly against France in February 2011, which Brazil lost 0-1. His 2nd game was a March 2011 friendly against Scotland, which Brazil won 2–0. He was not called up by Mano Menezes for the 2011 Copa América, but returned to the squad for a friendly against Germany in August 2011, which Brazil lost 2–3. After that, he went more than four years without playing for Brazil, missing the 2013 Confederations Cup, the 2014 World Cup and the 2015 Copa América.
Previously, he was part of the preliminary squad for the 2008 Summer Olympics, but was not included in the final 18-man squad by coach Dunga, only getting named in the standby list. He was recalled by the same Dunga, who had returned to the job after the 2014 World Cup, for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in November 2015.
On 17 November 2015, Augusto scored his first goal for Brazil in a 3–0 victory against Peru for 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification. He was a part of the Brazilian squads at the 2016 Copa América Centenario and the 2016 Olympic Games; in the latter, Brazil won the gold medal for the first time, and in the final against Germany after a 1–1 draw, he converted his penalty kick in an eventual 5–4 win for Brazil.
Renato netted twice against Haiti during the Copa América Centenario (7–1 win for Brazil), with Brazil eventually falling out in group stage. He also scored twice more during the qualifiers, at home to Uruguay (2–2) and away to Peru (2–0 win for Brazil).
In May 2018, he was named in Tite's final 23-man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. On 6 July 2018, Augusto scored Brazil's only goal in a 1–2 quarter-final defeat to Belgium as they were eliminated from the World Cup.
In June 2019, he was considered by some fans and part of the media to be one of the top contenders to take Neymar's spot in the national team ahead of the 2019 Copa América, held in Brazilian soil, after the PSG forward got injured in a friendly against Qatar, due to his previous works with coach Tite in Corinthians and the national team itself, but eventually lost out the callup to Chelsea's Willian.

Benjamin Radford

Benjamin Radford (born October 2, 1970) is an American writer, investigator, and skeptic. He has authored, coauthored or contributed to over twenty books and written over a thousand articles and columns on a wide variety of topics including urban legends, unexplained mysteries, the paranormal, critical thinking, mass hysteria, and media literacy. His book, "Mysterious New Mexico: Miracles, Magic, and Monsters in the Land of Enchantment", was published in the summer of 2014 and is a scientific investigation of famous legends and folklore in the state of New Mexico. In 2016 Radford published "Bad Clowns", a 2017 IPPY bronze award winner, and he is regarded as an expert on the bad clowns phenomenon.
Radford has appeared on "Good Morning America", CNN, The History Channel, the National Geographic Channel, the Learning Channel, CBC, BBC, ABC News, "The New York Times", and many other outlets.
Radford characterizes himself as one of the world's few science-based paranormal investigators, and has done first-hand research into psychics, ghosts, exorcisms, miracles, Bigfoot, stigmata, lake monsters, UFO sightings, reincarnation, crop circles, and other topics. "I'm open-minded. I never said I don't believe ghosts exist. But I can say I've looked at the research that's been done, and I've done personal investigations. In each particular case there either is or isn't good, compelling evidence, and so far I haven't seen it."
He regularly speaks at universities and conferences across the country and internationally about his research, folklore and about science and skepticism. Radford's books and investigations have been incorporated into several college and university courses on critical thinking, including at Western Washington University and the University of New Mexico.
Radford is also a contributor to the website Snopes.com, where he has researched and written articles debunking fakelore and a variety of popular myths including The Amityville Horror, and the claim that humans only use 10% of their brains.
Early life.
Radford became interested in "the mysterious and the unexplained" as a child from reading books about, "monsters and dragons, the Bermuda Triangle, psychics in Russia that could move automobiles with their mind", etc. He also became interested through television shows such as "That's Incredible" and "Ripley's Believe It or Not". He grew disenchanted with the lack of scientific rigor in the books and television shows because there seemed to be little or no investigation or proper references.
Radford's first encounter with formal skepticism came as a result of a fruitless search for beer in a "dry" county in Utah. Winning a regional essay contest while at the University of New Mexico, he was flown to present his paper at a college town in Utah. He and his colleagues came across a tiny used bookstore where he acquired an old issue of "Skeptical Inquirer" featuring an article on the prophesies of Nostradamus penned by none other than James Randi. He relates that this was the first article he'd read criticizing Nostradamus and offered "skeptical, logical, and reasonable explanations for the prophecies apparent accuracy".
Radford holds a bachelor's degree in psychology (graduating magna cum laude) with a minor in professional writing from the University of New Mexico where he was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honor society in 1993. He also has a master's degree in education from the University at Buffalo where his focus was on Science and the Public, and his masters thesis was titled "Misinformation in Eating Disorder Communications: Implications for Science Communication Policy". Radford stated that he chose this topic because it "involved several of my longstanding interests such as myths and misinformation ... eating disorders (a subject I first became involved with when helping an ex-girlfriend struggle with bulimia); and the news media".
He graduated from the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth in 2022, earning a master's degree in Public Health. He was inducted into the Delta Omega Honorary Society in Public Health, and was the recipient of a 2022 Social Justice Award from the Dartmouth Institute.
Career.
Journalism.
Radford served as managing editor of the science magazine "Skeptical Inquirer" from 1997 until early 2011, when he was promoted to deputy editor. He is also a regular columnist at the magazine. Until it suspended publication in 2009, he was editor-in-chief of the Spanish-language magazine "Pensar", published in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Radford has been a regular columnist for "Discovery News", "LiveScience.com", and the "Skeptical Briefs" newsletter.
Radford is a co-founder and former co-host of MonsterTalk, a podcast, which critically examines the science and folklore behind cryptozoological (and legendary) creatures such as Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster and werewolves. MonsterTalk won the 2012 Parsec podcast award for the “Best Fact Behind the Fiction” category.
Radford is a Research Fellow with the non-profit educational organization Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. He presented at the American Folklore Society's annual conference on "Folklore of the Chupacabra." in 2011 and 2024 He presented at several conferences of the International Society for Contemporary Legend Research (San Antonio in 2015, Brussels 2018, Sheffield 2023 and Logan 2024)
Radford's writings also focus on topics related to women and minorities, particularly in South America and Africa. Through his books, articles, blogs, and podcasts he has raised awareness of many social problems that disproportionately affect women, including modern witchcraft in India, Nepal, and Pakistan; the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping in 2014; acid attack victims in Pakistan; and sex trafficking.
Guy P. Harrison reviews Radford's 2016 book "Bad Clowns" saying, "Who knew naughty clowns could be so interesting?" Radford spends time on the "unfounded hype and hysteria" of stories of clowns in journalism including John Wayne Gacy and the Aurora Colorado shooter James Holmes.
Scientific paranormal investigator.
Described as a "professional skeptic", Radford works at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry investigating all manner of unusual claims and events. His work includes investigation, reporting, journalism, science literacy education, and public speaking.
Radford explains his approach by saying "I am not paid to doubt things; I am paid to promote science and investigate unusual claims. Our approach is empirical, evidence- and science-based. Science has proven itself incredibly successful in explaining and finding out about the world. If we wish to know why a certain disease strikes one person and not another, we turn to medicine instead of a witch doctor. If we wish to know how to build a bridge that can span a river, we turn to physics instead of psychics. Paranormal or “unexplained” topics are testable by science: either a psychic's prediction comes true or it doesn't; either ghosts exist in the real world or they don't. My job is not to doubt, nor debunk; it is to investigate. I have no vested interest in proving or disproving any unexplained phenomena; I get paid the same either way. But the cardinal rule is that an investigator must eliminate all the natural explanations before accepting supernatural ones, and must use sound science."
When asked "Have you ever been stumped by a mysterious claim?" Radford responded, "No". He responded more fully that there are times with some claims there isn't enough information or the information given to him wasn't correct. Radford compares these investigations to a crime scene investigating where there exists "a positive correlation between the quality of the available evidence and solving the mystery". Radford states he has a "high bar for what I am willing to concede is 'unexplained' or truly mysterious".
Paranormal researcher Brian D. Parsons in a review for "Investigating Ghosts", praised the book, stating, "Radford is not saying ghosts do not exist. He's merely explaining and demonstrating that ghost researchers have been going about things wrong for a very long time".
Awards.
As of 2023 Radford has been a finalist or winner of eight book awards. 
 
"Squaring the Strange".
In April 2017 Radford and Pascual Romero launched the "Squaring the Strange" podcast with evidence-based analysis and commentary on a variety of topics ranging from the paranormal to the political. Frequent contributor and content producer Celestia Ward was later added as a cohost. The podcast features discussions on a wide variety of subjects including psychology, myths, hoaxes, folklore, and science. It has featured Radford's detailed analysis of the Blue Whale Challenge scare and his passionate criticism of the History Channel's and its discredited photographic evidence.
Investigations.
Over the years, Radford published the results of investigations on a variety of phenomena deemed strange or paranormal. 
Psychic Detectives.
Radford has researched and conducted investigations into claims made by psychics for over 20 years, concentrating on psychic detectives. Examples include John Edward, Sylvia Browne, Theresa Caputo, Noreen Renier, Brian Ladd, Allison DuBois, Pamela Ragland, Nancy Weber and Jane Duperow He has also researched both historic and contemporaneous missing persons cases to determine whether the victims were recovered through psychic means. He has also researched both historic and contemporaneous missing persons cases to determine whether the victims were recovered through psychic means. Examples include Laci Peterson, Nicola Bulley, Elizabeth Smart, Holly Bobo, Natalee Holloway, Osama bin Laden, Harley Dilly, Harsha Maddula, Lisa Stebic, Madeleine McCann, Ada Wasson and Mary Ellen Walters.
In 2010, in the wake of a devastating earthquake in Haiti, Radford issued a public plea for psychics to aid in finding missing victims, calling out several practitioners who claimed to have helped on missing person cases. None responded or helped.
From his investigations, Radford concluded that in virtually every case the missing person was found either by police and searchers, or random passersby, without assistance from specific information provided by psychics. In many cases, after a person or body is recovered through ordinary means, psychics will reframe some of their earlier vague clues and predictions to make them appear accurate and relevant.
Chase Vault coffins (2017-2019).
Radford investigated 19th century reports of coffins that moved by themselves at the Chase Vault in the Barbados town of Oistins. He was able to determine the brick vault walls didn't show any of the damage would be expected from the movement of lead-lined coffins; there were also sourcing issues with the main testimony. Radford connected the legend with other similar stories in the region, showing the Chase Vault coffin tale is probably an adaptation of a story that has its point of origin elsewhere.
Dyatlov Pass Deaths (2014).
The 2014 Discovery Channel special "Russian Yeti: The Killer Lives" explored claims that the Dyatlov group was killed by an enraged Russian yeti. Radford wrote an in-depth review of the show for the Doubtful News website on June 1. In it, he notes that ""Russian Yeti: The Killer Lives" begins with the premise that the injuries sustained by the skiers were so grave and extraordinary that could only have been inflicted by an inhumanly strong creature." Radford points out that no evidence is offered to support this premise, and that the injuries (such as broken ribs, skull fractures, burnt hands, and a missing tongue) can be accounted for by an avalanche, struggling to start a fire, and post-mortem predation by conventional animals. Radford further points out that the only reference to “snowmen” in one of the hikers’ diaries is clearly a joke, never mentioned by any of the others in their private journals.
Chupacabra (2010).
Radford spent five years investigating the mysterious monster el chupacabra, and came to the conclusion that the monster sightings were inspired by the 1995 film "Species", and were aided and abetted by faulty eyewitness accounts, lack of forensic knowledge, and mass hysteria. His account of the investigation is detailed in his 2011 book "Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction, and Folklore". The investigation included eyewitness interviews, forensic and folkloric research, and "a field expedition to the jungles of Nicaragua" in search of the legendary monster.
Similar media-inspired monster sightings have been offered to explain for Loch Ness Monster (inspired by scenes depicting a Plesiosaur-like monster in the 1933 King Kong movie) and of the fictional bogey-man Slender Man reported on the talk-radio show "Coast to Coast".
"Tracking the Chupacabra" was a Finalist for two books awards including Book of the Year. According to "Outside Magazine", Radford came to the conclusion that the chupacabra "was nothing but a cinematic fever dream."
The Los Angeles UFO / mystery missile (2010).
In November 2010, a UFO was sighted and recorded in the sky over Los Angeles by a news helicopter cameraman.
In a column for Discovery News, Radford was one of the first journalists to critically analyze the video and correctly identify the UFO or “mystery missile” as an airplane contrail.
Kansas City gym ghost video (2008).
Radford investigated and solved the mystery of an alleged "ghost video" taken at Anytime Fitness, an all-night fitness club in Overland Park, Kansas in 2008. Surveillance cameras caught the glowing, fuzzy light in a workout area, wandering over the weight benches and fitness machines. The video was circulated on YouTube, generating more than 100,000 views.
Radford concluded the actual culprit to be merely an insect on the camera lens. His conclusions were based on the several facts: 1) the image only showed up on one of several cameras covering the area, 2) the fuzzy and out-of-focus image indicated that the object was closer rather than farther to the security camera which is designed to focus at longer distances, 3) the image appears to reflecting rather than emitting light, and 4) the image appeared to go over objects in the room rather than going around them.
Santa Fe courthouse ghost (2007).
In 2007, Radford solved the mystery of the "Santa Fe Courthouse Ghost", a mysterious, glowing, white blob that was captured on videotape June 15, by a security camera at a courthouse in Santa Fe, New Mexico. While the court personnel who first saw the image could not explain it, others soon offered their own explanations, and a ghost was among the most popular. Radford conducted several days of on-site field investigations at the courthouse, and after several experiments duplicated the "ghost" effect by placing insects on the video camera that recorded the original event.
The White Witch of Rose Hall (2007).
In "Fortean Times" magazine and his book "Scientific Paranormal Investigation", Radford published his re-creations of the "ghost photos" taken at Rose Hall, a mansion near Montego Bay in Jamaica, showing that alleged paranormal phenomena caught on film at that location were camera artifacts and reflected flashes, not ghosts.
Pokémon panic (2001).
In 2001, Radford investigated the mysterious 1997 incident in which thousands of Japanese children seemingly suffered seizures while watching "Dennō Senshi Porygon", an episode of the "Pokémon" anime. Though many doctors advanced theories including photosensitive epilepsy, Radford proffered evidence that the incident was rooted in mass hysteria. The resulting article, co-authored by Robert Bartholomew, was published in the February 2001 "Southern Medical Journal".
"We studied a reported illness outbreak occurring on December 16, 1997, involving more than 12,000 Japanese children who had various signs and symptoms of illness after watching an episode of a popular animated cartoon, Pokémon. While photosensitive epilepsy was diagnosed in a minuscule fraction of those affected, this explanation cannot account for the breadth and pattern of the events. The characteristic features of the episode are consistent with the diagnosis of epidemic hysteria, triggered by sudden anxiety after dramatic mass media reports describing a relatively small number of genuine photosensitive-epilepsy seizures. The importance of the mass media in precipitating outbreaks of mass psychogenic illness is discussed."
The "Champ" photo (1977).
The photo, taken by Sandra Mansi in 1977, sparked investigations and national interest into the creature allegedly living in Lake Champlain. John Kirk, in his book "In the Domain of the Lake Monsters", writes that "The monster of Lake Champlain... has the distinction of being the only lake monster of whom there is a reasonably clear photograph. It... is extremely good evidence of an unidentified lake-dwelling animal". After investigating claims of a monster in Lake Champlain that has been nicknamed "Champ", Radford, along with Joe Nickell concluded that the object in the famous photo was almost certainly a floating log or tree-trunk. Joe Zarzynski, author of "Champ: Beyond the Legend" (1984), calls the photo "the best single piece of evidence on Champ."
The results of the Champ and Mansi photo investigation were published in the book "Lake Monster Mysteries", as well as in "Skeptical Inquirer" magazine and "Fortean Times" magazine. Radford and Nickell re-enacted their experiments and investigation for the Discovery Channel in 1995.
Films.
Radford has appeared in films that address his investigatory work. In "Wrinkles the Clown" he discussed the historical roots of deviant clowns, and in "Science Friction" he was interviewed about his experience with documentaries which misrepresent the interviews with experts in their field.
In addition to his scientific skepticism work, Radford has written and directed several animated short films. In "Sirens" (2009), "A young boy in a small-town library avoids his math homework and is instead drawn into the world of the mythological Sirens, beautiful women who lured sailors to their doom."
Both films screened at film festivals around the world, and "Clicker Clatter" won the “Best Traditional Animation” award at the 2007 California International Animation Festival.
Board games.
"Playing Gods".
In 2008 Radford released "Playing Gods: The Board Game of Divine Domination", a satirical board game he created based on theme of gods warring over the control of believers. The game is described as a "theological version of "Risk"" and contains figures based on Jesus, Moses, Buddha and many other religions including satirical religions like the Flying Spaghetti Monster and J. R. Bob Dobbs. The game made its world premiere at the New York Toy Fair in March 2009 and debuted at Dragon*Con in Atlanta, Georgia. "Playing Gods" is produced through Radford's company, Balls Out Entertainment.
Australia's "Synergy Magazine" reported "Playing Gods" has "some of the nicest pawns I have ever seen in a board game... has great game play and comes with a smart, cynical and satirical tone. "Playing Gods" is blasphemy with style and offers a great board game with a good dose of insight and a great load of fun!”. Other players have praised the game as "one of the coolest and most important things to happen to parlor games", and "awesome, and damned funny.. it's "Candyland" for people who want the express train to hell". Carl Raschke, professor of religious studies at University of Denver, criticized Radford's board game telling "USA Today" that the game "sounds too stupid to go far".
"Undead Apocalypse".
In 2013, Radford released plans for a followup to the "Playing Gods" board game, entitled "Undead Apocalypse: War of the Damned". It would have integrated genuine lore concerning werewolves, vampires and zombies into the board game. A Kickstarter campaign to fund the game was launched in June 2013, but was cancelled when it became clear it would not fully fund.

Bankhead Tunnel

The Bankhead Tunnel, formally the John H. Bankhead Tunnel, is a road tunnel in Mobile, Alabama that carries Government Street under the Mobile River from Blakeley Island to the downtown Mobile business district.
It is named for John H. Bankhead, an Alabama politician and U.S. Senator (served 1907-1920) who was also the grandfather of actress Tallulah Bankhead. It, like the larger George Wallace Tunnel (built 1969-1973) a few blocks downriver from it, was constructed in Mobile at the shipyards of the Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company (ADDSCO), from 1938-1940. The eastern end of the Bankhead Tunnel features a large "flood door" that can be closed to prevent water from Mobile Bay flooding the tunnel during surges from hurricanes or tropical storms. It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on January 25, 1977.
History.
The tunnel was built in sections and floated to the proper positions, then sunk. Each section was sunk next to the previous section and joined underwater. When all sections were connected, and concrete set into place, they were pumped dry and finished out. The depth of clearance is 40 ft (12.2 m) for the ship channel over the tunnel. The entrances were designed in the Art Deco style that was popular during the time of construction. It was completed in 1940 at a cost of $4 million and opened to the public on February 20, 1941. A toll fee was charged at the east side, from 1941 to the mid-1970s, when the toll plaza was dismantled. The tube carries two lanes of travel, and no pedestrian or non-motorized vehicular traffic is permitted.
The tunnel was designed by Oliver Fowlkes and construction directed by Wayne Palmer of Mobile. Only passenger cars and pickup trucks are still allowed to travel through the tunnel, as it is very narrow. Large trucks can use the George Wallace Tunnel on Interstate 10 a few blocks to the south. However, trucks with hazardous cargo must use the Cochrane–Africatown USA Bridge (U.S. 90/U.S. 98 Truck) a few miles to the north.
Filming location.
The tunnel was the location of a scene in the 1977 blockbuster "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" by director Steven Spielberg, a film which was primarily filmed in the Mobile area. In this particular scene Roy Neary, played by Richard Dreyfuss, drives through the tunnel as he chases UFOs.
The tunnel was later featured during a motorcycle chase scene in the 1991 film "Stone Cold", starring Brian Bosworth.

John E. Warren Jr.

John Earl Warren Jr. (November 16, 1946 – January 14, 1969) was a United States Army officer and a recipient of the U.S. military's highest decoration — the Medal of Honor — for his actions in the Vietnam War.
Early life and education.
Warren joined the U.S. Army from New York City in 1967.
Career.
On January 14, 1969, as a first lieutenant, Warren was commanding a platoon in Tây Ninh Province, South Vietnam as part of Operation Toan Thang II, when the unit came under attack. During the fight, Warren fell on an enemy-thrown grenade to shield others from the blast. The action cost him his life.
Medal of Honor citation.
Warren's official Medal of Honor citation reads:
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. 1st Lt. Warren, distinguished himself at the cost of his life while serving as a platoon leader with Company C. While moving through a rubber plantation to reinforce another friendly unit, Company C came under intense fire from a well-fortified enemy force. Disregarding his safety, 1st Lt. Warren with several of his men began maneuvering through the hail of enemy fire toward the hostile positions. When he had come to within 6 feet of one of the enemy bunkers and was preparing to toss a hand grenade into it, an enemy grenade was suddenly thrown into the middle of his small group. Thinking only of his men, 1st Lt. Warren fell in the direction of the grenade, thus shielding those around him from the blast. His action, performed at the cost of his life, saved 3 men from serious or mortal injury. First Lt. Warren's ultimate action of sacrifice to save the lives of his men was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit on him, his unit, and the U.S. Army.
Legacy.
Warren is buried in Long Island National Cemetery, Farmingdale, New York.
In May 2022, the main street on Fort Hamilton Army Base in Brooklyn, New York was renamed John Warren Avenue in his honor. The street was originally named for confederate general Robert E. Lee.

Skid Row, Los Angeles

Skid Row is the unofficial name for a neighborhood in Downtown Los Angeles officially known as Central City East.
Skid Row contains one of the largest stable populations of homeless people in the United States, estimated at over 4,400, and has been known for its condensed homeless population since at least the 1930s. Its long history of police raids, targeted city initiatives, and homelessness advocacy make it one of the most notable districts in Los Angeles.
Covering 50 city blocks immediately east of downtown Los Angeles, Skid Row is bordered by Third Street to the north, Seventh Street to the south, Alameda Street to the east, and Main Street to the west.
Etymology.
The term "skid row" or "skid road," referring to an area of a city where people live who are "on the skids," derives from a logging term. Loggers would transport their logs to a nearby river by sliding them down roads made from greased skids. Loggers who had accompanied the load to the bottom of the road would wait there for transportation back up the hill to the logging camp. By extension, the term began to be used for places where people with no money and nothing to do gathered, becoming the generic term in North America for a depressed street in a city.
Demographics.
In 2019, the Central City East's racial demographics consisted of 39.7% Black/African American, 22.3% White, 16.3% Asian, 15.1% Hispanic or Latino, 2.5% American Indian/Alaska Native, 0.6% Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander, 3.1% 2+ races, and 0.5% other races.
According to the city's data, 53.1% of the population were born in California, 27.0% were born in another state, 18.8% were born in another country, and 1.1% were native residents born outside of the United States.
The population was estimated to be approximately 10,580 individuals over 0.392 square miles, though there is currently no up-to-date approximation due to limited data. In 2023, the Los Angeles Longitudinal Enumeration and Demographic Survey estimated that the population increased by 13% after the COVID-19 pandemic, though no exact population estimate was provided. Out of the 10,850 estimated to be in the population, 7,004 were identified as male, and 3,574 were identified as female.
The age groups in the region were spread out with 7.78% being under the age of 18, 1.38% from 18 to 24, 60.94% from 25 to 54, 19.49% from 55 to 61, and 10.41% who were 62 years of age or older. The median age for the male population was 50.9 years, and the median age for the female population was 50.3 years. Among these numbers, veterans made up 9.90% of the 10,850.
The per capita income for the neighborhood in 2000 was $14,210. About 41.8% of the population were below the poverty line. In 2008, the median household income for Skid Row and the surrounding areas was $15,003. In 2019, the median household income for Skid Row residents was approximately $12,070, where 68.9% of the population was below the poverty line. The overall income for Skid Row continued to be below the poverty line at the time, with $67,418 being the average median household income for the Greater Los Angeles population. In 2019, the average household size was 9.9 people living in a single unit. 60.2% of the households in Skid Row were family households consisting of married-couple families with children, 25.2% were single-mother households, and 18.7% were married-couple families.
History.
1880s through 1960s.
At the end of the 19th century, a number of residential hotels opened in the area as it became home to a transient population of seasonal laborers. By the 1930s, Skid Row was home to as many as 10,000 homeless people. It supported saloons, residential hotels, and social services, which drew people from the populations they served to congregate in the area.
When railroads were constructed on the outskirts of the downtown area the agricultural fields to the east transitioned into industrial zones. These industrial areas attracted a predominantly transient male workforce, many of whom traveled by train seeking employment in railroad-related industries or seasonal work in agriculture. It became "an enclave of small hotels, movie theaters and cheap eateries that served transient workers in seasonal industries and nearby railroads".
In June 1947, Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) chief Clemence B. Horrall ordered what he called a "blockade raid" of the whole Skid Row area. Over 350 people were arrested. Assistant Chief Joseph Reed, who claimed that "at least 50 percent of all the crime in Los Angeles originates in the Skid Row area," stated that there had been no "strong arm robberies" on Skid Row as late as one week after the raid. Long time residents, however, were skeptical that the changes would last.
In the 1950s, the area "evolved into a place where alcoholics and other people down on their luck could get a meal and a bed". In 1956, the city of Los Angeles was in the midst of a program to "rehabilitate" Skid Row through the clearance of decaying buildings. The program was presented to property owners in the area as an economy measure. Gilbert Morris, then superintendent of building, said that at that point the provision of free social services to the approximately one square mile of Skid Row cost the city over $5 million per year as opposed to the city average of $110,000 per square mile annually. The city used administrative hearings to compel the destruction of nuisance properties at the expense of the owner. By July 1960, the clearance program was said to be 87% complete in the Skid Row area. With increased building codes during the 1960s, owners of residential hotels found demolition to be more cost-effective than adhering to repairs. The total number of these units is estimated to have dropped from 15,000 to 7,500 over the following decade. Many residents of the area found themselves homeless with the loss of half of the affordable housing provided by hotels.
1970s containment zone.
Skid Row was established by city officials in 1976 as an unofficial "containment zone", where shelters and services for homeless people would be tolerated.
During the 1970s, two Catholic Workers — Catherine Morris, a former nun, and her husband, Jeff Dietrich — founded the "Hippie Kitchen" in the back of a van. Over forty years later, in March 2019, aged 84 and 72, they remained active in their work feeding Skid Row residents.
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, many Vietnam veterans found themselves drawn to Skid Row, due to the services and missions already in place there and feeling outcast from other areas. Like those after World War II, many of them ended up on the streets. It was around this time that the demographics of Skid Row shifted from predominantly White and elderly to those there today (see: Demographics).
1987 crackdowns.
In February 1987, LAPD chief Daryl Gates, backed by then-Mayor Tom Bradley, announced plans for another crackdown on the homeless on Skid Row. Police and firefighters conducted a number of sweeps through the area but the plan was abandoned due to opposition by advocates for the homeless.
When Gates announced in May that the crackdown would resume, Los Angeles City Attorney (and future mayor) James K. Hahn responded that he would not prosecute people arrested in the planned sweeps. Hahn stated that he was "not going to prosecute individuals for not having a place to stay. I simply will not prosecute people for being poor, underprivileged and unable to find a place to sleep until I'm convinced that a viable alternative to sleeping on the streets exists." Gates, still backed by Bradley, responded: "As the elected city attorney of Los Angeles, Mr. Hahn has a responsibility to file prosecutable cases which are presented to him by the Los Angeles Police Department."
A few days later, then-Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky introduced a proposal that the city stop enforcing its anti-camping laws on Skid Row until adequate housing could be found for all its residents. The council rejected Yaroslavsky's proposal, but after hearing testimony from Assistant Police Chief David Dotson describing the LAPD's intended crackdown methodology, the council passed a motion asking Gates not to enforce the anti-camping laws until adequate housing could be found for the area's residents.
2000s patient dumping.
In September 2005, hospitals and law enforcement agencies were discovered to be "dumping" homeless people on Skid Row. Then-Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa ordered an investigation and William Bratton, LAPD chief at the time, claimed that the department was not targeting homeless people specifically, but only people who violated city ordinances. The Los Angeles City Attorney investigated more than 50 of about 150 reported cases of dumping. By early 2007, the city attorney had filed charges against only one hospital, Kaiser Permanente. Because there were no laws specifically covering the hospital's actions, it was charged, in an untested strategy, with false imprisonment. In response to the lack of legal recourse available to fight patient dumping, California state senator Gil Cedillo sponsored legislation against it in February 2007.
Since Mike Feuer took office as City Attorney in 2013, he has settled eight additional cases of patient dumping with various hospitals around Los Angeles. These cases have been a part of a larger attempt to solve the issue, in addition to working with some hospitals on long-term solutions. The total settlements from all eight have been over four million dollars.
2000 to 2009.
In 2002, newly appointed LAPD Chief William Bratton announced a plan to clean up Skid Row by, among other things, enforcing the anti-camping ordinance. A man named Robert Lee Purrie was cited twice and arrested for violating the ordinance in December 2002 and January 2003. His possessions, consisting of his tent, "blankets, clothes, cooking utensils, a hygiene kit, and other personal effects", were thrown into the street by the police.
In April 2006, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in favor of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in its suit against the city of Los Angeles, filed on behalf of Purrie and five other homeless people, finding that the city was in violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and sections of the California Constitution guaranteeing due process and equal protection and prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment in reference to "Robinson v. California". The court stated that "the Eighth Amendment prohibits the City from punishing involuntary sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks that is an unavoidable consequence of being human and homeless without shelter in the City of Los Angeles." The court described the anti-camping ordinance as "one of the most restrictive municipal laws regulating public spaces in the United States."
The ACLU sought a compromise in which the LAPD would be barred from arresting homeless people or confiscating their possessions on Skid Row between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. The compromise plan, which was accepted by the city of Los Angeles, permits sleeping on the sidewalk except "within 10 feet of any business or residential entrance" and only between these hours.
Downtown development business interests and the Central City East Association (CCEA) came out against the compromise. On September 20, 2006, the Los Angeles City Council voted to reject the compromise. On October 3, 2006, police arrested Skid Row's transients for sleeping on the streets for the first time in months. On October 10, 2006, under pressure from the ACLU, the city tacitly agreed to the compromise by declining to appeal the court's decision.
2006 Safer Cities Initiative.
The Safer Cities Initiative (SCI) was a 68-week policy implemented in 2006 by the Los Angeles Police Department dealing with homeless encampments in Skid Row. The policy, led by former police chief William Bratton, assigned approximately 50 police officers to the Skid Row area to enforce stricter policing of offenses in accordance with the broken windows theory of policing. Through policing these offenses (including non-violent offenses such as jaywalking or littering), the LAPD sought to establish a heightened appearance of public order as a punitive deterrent for criminals. One study by the LAPD claimed that four years post-implementation, crime rates had reduced by approximately 46%, while deaths dropped approximately 34%.
While the Los Angeles Police Department has stood by the policy's effectiveness and its impact on the local community, one study suggested that while crime rates have reduced, higher incarceration rates were a contributing factor to the area's increasing homeless population. The 27,000 arrests over the duration of the short time period of 2005 to 2009, with 1,200 of those arrests being among the SCI's targeted unhoused population for unpaid citations, showcase the community's concerns for the Safer Cities Initiative tactics for targeting homelessness. These claims have been echoed by local activists, who argue that the initiative's frequent use of arrest warrants and tickets prevented individuals in-need from acquiring long-term housing and career opportunities.
2010s.
In 2012, the Skid Row Running Club was founded by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Mitchell, as an effort to improve the livelihood of those in the area. A documentary titled “Skid Row Marathon” was made about the group, which includes homeless people, police officers, and convicted felons.
The city came to an agreement in May 2019 that removed the limit on the number of possessions kept on the street in the neighborhood. The agreement allows the city to still seize any items that threaten public safety and health, as well as large “bulky items.” This includes most pieces of furniture or appliances. Items that do not fall into those categories will be stored for 90 days. If an item is deemed important enough, such as medication, it must be able to be claimed within 24 hours.
2020s COVID-19 pandemic.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the requirement of individuals to take down their tents for sidewalk cleanings was suspended, with the intent of not displacing people during the cleanings, which might spread COVID-19.
Another issue at the time was maintaining hygiene at a time when strict sanitation protocols were recommended. An LA Times reporter, James Queally, wrote about the effect of the city's mandated lockdown orders and strict protocols on the citizens. The closing down of public restrooms, stores and gyms made it hard for many in the area, primarily the homeless, to clean up. In an effort to resolve this, Los Angeles city officials set up 360 hand washing stations and a dozen mobile shower trucks. To offer more resources, recreation centers were turned into housing shelters.
Culture.
Skid Row is home to many artists. Due to its location bordering districts such as the Historic Core and the Arts District, Skid Row often hosts events that cross neighborhood borders. In 2019, a performance group called the Los Angeles Poverty Department began providing artistic resources to Skid Row, primarily in the form of theater classes and performances. "Los Angeles Times" journalist Margaret Gray claimed that audience members "somehow felt like part of a family" when the performers were on stage and noted "while many charitable organizations focus on warehousing and policing homeless populations, LAPD attempts to remind them of their unique humanity, to empower them to take collective responsibility for their neighborhood and one another's health and safety". Since 2009 the organization has also sponsored the Festival for All Skid Row Artists.
The "Skid Row City Limits Mural" was created solely by volunteers to express the community's feelings about the history and modern state of the neighborhood [see Landmarks]. The "Dear Neighbor Mural" is another Skid Row art piece, aimed at making housing a right for all citizens. In addition, Skid Row Karaoke is a long time tradition of residents, which is weekly and open to all.
Crime.
Within the LAPD Central Area, which includes Skid Row and other areas in Downtown Los Angeles, crimes showed a 30% decrease year over year in Skid Row after the introduction of the Safer Cities Initiatives in 2006.
Within the first two years of the 2006 implementation of the Safer Cities Initiative in Skid Row, 18,000 arrests were made and 24,000 citations were given for non-violent offenses. This is 69 times the rate of policing in the rest of Los Angeles.
Between July and October 2019, the crime breakdown of 997 reported crimes within 0.5 miles of Skid Row's center was 21.97% vehicle break-in/theft, 27.08% larceny, 24.67% assault, 13.14% robbery, 6.12% burglary, 4.61% motor vehicle theft, 1.04% sex crime, 0.6% arson and 0.4% homicide.
Government and infrastructure.
The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) serves the neighborhood with Station No. 3 in the Business District, one in the West and Station No. 9 in Skid Row. Station No. 9 operates one engine, one truck, two ALS rescue ambulances, and one BLS rescue ambulance. As of October 2023, it is the busiest firehouse in Los Angeles. Fire engines and ambulances serving the neighborhood have historically had "Skid Row" emblazoned on their sides. On June 1, 2006, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that fire officials planned to change the legend on the vehicles to read "Central City East". Many residents supported the change, but it was opposed by firefighters and some residents who take pride in the sense that they live in a tough area.
The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services operates the Central Health Center in Downtown Los Angeles, serving Skid Row.
Services for homeless people in Los Angeles are centralized in Skid Row. Examples include the Volunteers of America, the Union Rescue Mission, The Jonah Project, Downtown Mental Health (a branch of the Department of Mental Health), LAMP, Downtown Women's Center, The Weingart Foundation, Los Angeles Mission, Fred Jordan Mission, The Society of St. Vincent de Paul's Cardinal Manning Center, and Midnight Mission. In 2007, Union Rescue Mission opened Hope Gardens, a facility outside of Skid Row which is exclusively for women and children.
Transportation.
The community is served primarily by eight Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus lines:
In popular culture.
"Lost Angels: Skid Row Is My Home", a documentary produced by Agi Orsi, tells the story of eight homeless people, including an Olympic athlete and Harvard graduate, who navigate a world of poverty, drug abuse, and mental illness to build a sense of community. The film examines how the City of Los Angeles criminalizes homelessness by prohibiting Skid Row residents from standing and sitting for a prolonged period of time in a public place.
The site has appeared as a location in several movies, including "The Sting", and television shows such as "Starsky &amp; Hutch", "Baretta", and "Quincy, M.E.".
Skid Row was also used as a location for filming the music videos for the Michael Jackson songs "Beat It" and "The Way You Make Me Feel".
Rock band U2 performed "Where the Streets Have No Name" upon a rooftop for the song's music video; the performance referenced the Beatles' final concert, as shown in the film "Let It Be".
Electronic musician James Ferraro's 2015 album "Skid Row" is conceptualized around the area.
Skid Row was also referenced in "Little Shop of Horrors", a horror comedy rock musical. The song "Skid Row (Downtown)", describes the living condition of the main character Seymour Krelborn, who is a poor young man, an orphan living in Skid Row. The musical premiered off-off-Broadway in 1982.
A photograph of rock band the Doors, posing behind the lobby window of the Morrison Hotel, was used as the cover for their famous fifth album. The photographer was Henry Diltz.

Dayton Street Historic District

The Dayton Street Historic District is located in the Old West End neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. It was once known as "Millionaires' Row" for the prominent industrialists who resided in a row of opulent mansions built between 1850 and 1890. It is bounded by Bank Street, Poplar Street, Linn Street, and Winchell Avenue. The district was designated and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 25, 1973.
Due to its location well north of Cincinnati when the city was founded, the district occupies land that was originally used by small farmers, both for crop fields and for livestock pasture; some of the massive stockyards in the city once known as "Porkopolis" were located nearby, although even farther from the original city. As the city grew, wealthy residents built country houses within the district's boundaries, beginning c. 1840 and continuing until the Civil War era. Significant development began c. 1860 and continued for the next two decades. Typical buildings erected during this time are multi-story Italianate residences constructed of brick or stone, similar to townhouses but detached. At the neighborhood's height, the residents were wealthy businessmen, most of whom were active in the city's meatpacking and brewing industries, and many of these men were careful to beautify their homes with elements such as stone retaining walls and fences of cast iron; while much of the stonework and ironwork has been lost, large amounts of both remain. The entire historic district embraces approximately four hundred contributing properties, almost all single-family houses, although there are occasional exceptions; the former Police Station No. 5 on York Street was included. The Hauck House Museum is located at 812 Dayton Street and the Mayor George Hatch House is located at 830 Dayton Street.

Group 1 Rugby League was a rugby league competition held in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia, run under the auspices of the Country Rugby League. The group, however, still runs a junior rugby league competition. When the Group 18-Gold Coast competition dissolved in 2005, the New South Wales sides joined together with Group 1 to form a divisional league, Northern Rivers Regional Rugby League (NRRRL). Group 18 also still holds its own individual junior rugby league competition.

Rhododendron maximum

Rhododendron maximum is a species of "Rhododendron" native to the Appalachians of eastern North America, from Alabama north to coastal Nova Scotia. Its common names include great laurel, great rhododendron, rosebay rhododendron, American rhododendron and big rhododendron.
Description.
"Rhododendron maximum" is an evergreen shrub growing to , rarely , tall. The leaves are long and broad. The flowers are diameter, white, pink or pale purple, often with small greenish-yellow spots. The fruit is a dry capsule long, containing numerous small seeds. The leaves can be poisonous. Leaves are sclerophyllous, simple, alternate, and oblong (10 to 30 cm long, 5 to 8 cm wide). It retains its waxy, deep-green leaves for up to 8 years, but once shed are slow to decompose. It produces large, showy, white to purple flowers each June and July.
Distribution and habitat.
Rosebay rhododendron is the most frequently occurring and dominant species of "Rhododendron" in the southern Appalachian region, and occurs occasionally on mesic hill-slopes throughout the upper Piedmont Crescent of the Southeastern United States.
Ecology.
Approximately 12,000 square miles in the southern Appalachians are occupied by this species where it dominates the understory. This species has historically been confined to riparian areas and other mesic sites but takes advantage of disturbed areas where it is present to advance onto sub-mesic sites. It prefers deep well-drained acid soils high in organic matter where it produces a thick, peat-like humus. It prefers low to medium light conditions for optimum carbon gain, and has a tremendous capacity for avoiding cavitation during freeze-thaw cycles. Where extensive overstory mortality has eliminated most of the overstory, this species forms a thick and continuous subcanopy known locally as 'laurel slicks' or 'laurel hells'. Rosebay rhododendron is an important structural and functional component of southern Appalachian forest ecosystems. What is not clear is whether or not we are in a period of advancement or retreat for this species. For example, on poorly drained sites on ridge or upper slope positions, large areas of rosebay rhododendron, particularly at the high elevations, have recently died out presumably due to the "Phytophthora" fungus, or due to recent prolonged periods of below-average precipitation. Yet, rosebay rhododendron now occupies sites that historically were free of evergreen understory. There are still important questions to be answered regarding this species to completely understand its role in forest understories.
In North Carolina, US, "Pestalotiopsis" which is a genus of ascomycete fungi causes grey-brown spots on the living leaves.
Reproduction.
Rosebay rhododendron is clonal. It is capable, however, of reproducing both vegetatively and sexually. It reproduces vegetatively through a process called 'layering' where it produces roots from above ground woody parts when in contact with the forest floor. The fruit is produced from showy flowers from March to August. The fruit is an oblong capsule that ripens in the fall, and splits along the sides soon after ripening to release large numbers of minute seed (c. 400 per capsule). Microsite requirements for seed germination are relatively specific (e.g., high in organic matter such as rotting logs); hence, the majority of reproduction is vegetative resulting in a clonal distribution.
Cultivation.
Seeds from rosebay rhododendron are minute and it is estimated that approximately 11 million are contained in 1 kg. Commercial seed production is generally from cultivated hybrids. Seeds from wild sources are not commonly sold commercially. Rosebay rhododendron is a slow-growing shrub and has a very high sprout potential. If mechanical removal is attempted in the case of forest management, extremely high densities are attained by this species in a matter of a few years. Prescribed fire has also been used to control this species but with limited success.
Uses.
Rosebay rhododendron is a striking and aesthetically pleasing feature of mesic southern Appalachian forests. It is one of the largest and hardiest rhododendrons grown commercially. Several cultivars with white to purple flowers have been selected for the horticultural trade. Where it occurs naturally, it produces a showy, white, pink, or light purple flower primarily in June, but occurs from March into August. Rosebay rhododendron maintains deep-green foliage year round. This species affords protection to steep watersheds and shelter for wildlife. The wood is very hard and is occasionally used for specialty wood products.
Detrimental effects.
For all its prized qualities as a naturally occurring component of the landscape or as plantings in residential and commercial landscaping, rosebay rhododendron can have an inhibitory effect on regeneration of other plant species. There is some evidence to suggest that due to fire suppression and the absence of other cultural activities (i.e., mountain-land grazing), this species has advanced beyond the mesic forest sites into sub-mesic understories. The significance of this movement onto previously unoccupied sites centers around the impacts of rosebay rhododendron on plant succession and resource availability. Rosebay rhododendron is associated with reduced woody and herbaceous seedling abundance throughout its range, and hence poses a serious impediment to the production of wood products. The mechanism(s) by which rosebay rhododendron reduces seedling survival has been the subject of much debate. Possible sources of inhibition include allelopathy, competition for resources including light, physical and chemical attributes of the forest floor and soil, and interactions between some or all sources.
Alternate common names.

Thomas Fitch (governor)

Thomas Fitch ( – July 18, 1774) was an American judge and politician who served as the governor of Connecticut from 1754 to 1766.
Family and early life.
Fitch was born at Norwalk, Connecticut, the son of Thomas Fitch III (1675–1731), an investor in the Equivalent Lands and his first wife, Sarah Boardman Fitch. He graduated from Yale in 1721 then went on to obtain a master's degree. Fitch married Hannah Hall in 1724. The couple had several children, the first Thomas Fitch, V, was born in 1725. Fitch served as Norwalk Justice of the Peace, Deputy and Assistant to the Connecticut General Assembly, Deputy Governor, Chief Justice (to the Connecticut Superior Court), and finally Governor of the Colony of Connecticut.
Fitch died July 18, 1774. He is buried in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery.
Fitch house.
The Fitch house was partially burned during Tryon's raid, which was carried out by William Tryon's troops in July 1779 and left only one wing of the house was left standing. Fitch descendants lived in the rebuilt house until 1945. In 1956 the Fitch house was relocated to make way for the construction of the Connecticut Turnpike. It stands today as part of the Mill Hill Historic Park in Norwalk next to the Green.
Legacy.
Fitch Street in East Norwalk is named in honor of the Fitch family including: Thomas Fitch I (1612–1704), a town founder; Thomas IV, the governor; and Thomas Fitch V, soldier and patriot.
His son, Colonel Thomas Fitch, V (1725–1795), served with British colonial troops in the French and Indian Wars; primarily in upstate New York, near Fort Crailo. After that conflict Thomas, V returned to Norwalk and was a prominent resident during and after the American Revolution. He served as a town councilman and helped with the reconstruction efforts after the burning of Norwalk in 1779.
The former Thomas Fitch school along Strawberry Hill Avenue in Norwalk was named in his honor, as well as to honor the other Thomas Fitches who contributed to the town.
The unincorporated settlement of Fitchville, located in the Firelands area of the historic Connecticut Western Reserve in the State of Ohio, is named for the governor and his family.

George Grossmith Jr.

George Grossmith Jr. (11 May 1874 – 6 June 1935) was an English actor, theatre producer and manager, director, playwright and songwriter, best remembered for his work in and with Edwardian musical comedies. Grossmith was also an important innovator in bringing "cabaret" and "revues" to the London stage. Born in London, he took his first role on the musical stage at the age of 18 in "Haste to the Wedding" (1892), a West End collaboration between his famous songwriter and actor father and W. S. Gilbert.
Grossmith soon became an audience favourite playing "dude" roles. Early appearances in musicals included George Edwardes's hit "A Gaiety Girl" in 1893, and "Go-Bang" and "The Shop Girl" in 1894. In 1895, Grossmith left the musical stage, instead appearing in straight comedies, but after a few years he returned to performing in musicals and Victorian burlesques. Early in the new century, he had a string of successes in musicals for Edwardes, including "The Toreador" (1901), "The School Girl" (1903), "The Orchid" (1903), "The Spring Chicken" (1905), "The New Aladdin" (1906), "The Girls of Gottenberg" (1907), "Our Miss Gibbs" (1909), "Peggy" (1911), "The Sunshine Girl" (1912) and "The Girl on the Film" (1913). The lanky Grossmith was often comically paired with the diminutive Edmund Payne. At the same time, he developed a reputation as a co-writer of musicals and revues, usually adding jokes.
Grossmith established himself as a major producer, together with Edward Laurillard, of such hits as "Tonight's the Night" (1914), "Theodore &amp; Co" (1916) and "Yes, Uncle!" (1917). He wrote the long-running revue series that began with "The Bing Boys Are Here" (1916), scheduling these projects around his naval service in World War I. He then produced "Eastward Ho!" (1919) and produced, co-wrote, directed and sometimes starred in, "Kissing Time" (1919), "A Night Out" (1920), "Sally" (1921), "The Cabaret Girl" (1922), "The Beauty Prize" (1923) and "Primrose" (1924), many of these featuring Leslie Henson. He also continued to appear in other producers' shows, including "The Naughty Princess" (1920) and "No, No, Nanette" (1925).
Later, he performed in such pieces as "Princess Charming" (1926) and appeared in at least ten films for London Film Productions Ltd., among other films, in the 1930s. He produced "The Land of Smiles" and "Cavalcade" (both in 1931), and in 1933, he played Touchstone in a production of "As You Like It".
Life and career.
George Grossmith was born in Haverstock Hill, London, on 11 May 1874. He was the eldest son of the writer and Gilbert and Sullivan star George Grossmith, and his mother was Emmeline Rosa, née Noyce. His grandfather was also named "George Grossmith", and even though he was the third George Grossmith, he was credited on stage as "George Grossmith Jnr". His brother was the actor Lawrence Grossmith.
Grossmith studied at University College School in London, and in Paris, and his parents hoped that he would follow an army career, but that was not to be. In 1895, Grossmith married burlesque and musical comedy actress Gertrude Elizabeth "Cissie" Rudge (1873–1951), whose stage name was Adelaide Astor, and who was one of five actress Rudge Sisters. Letty Lind was the most famous of these. Grossmith and his wife had three children, Ena Sylvia Victoria (1896–1944), who became a stage and film actress; George (1906–c.2000), who became a theatrical manager; and Rosa Mary (1907–1988; she married Col. Edward Harry George 1904–1957, and they had three sons, including John C. G. George).
Grossmith was known for "speaking" songs and for his easy comic grace on stage. He was tall and gangling, with a "face hardly less extraordinary than his curious legs and a humour as unctuous as his father's at his best."
Early career.
Grossmith's first role in a musical was at the age of 18 in a small comic role in his father's collaboration with W. S. Gilbert, "Haste to the Wedding". He next appeared in several small comic roles, including in "The Baroness" (1892).
Grossmith's breakthrough came in "Morocco Bound" (1893), where he made the most of the small role of Sir Percy Pimpleton by adding ad-libbed sight and word gags, becoming an audience favourite and establishing his style of playing aristocratic "silly-ass" or "dude" roles. This was followed by appearances in "Go-Bang" (1894 as Augustus Fitzpoop) and in George Edwardes's production of "A Gaiety Girl" (1893 as Major Barclay). He also played in "Pick-me-up" at the Trafalgar Square Theatre in 1894 with Jessie Bond and Letty Lind. Edwardes then hired Grossmith to create the part of Bertie Boyd in the hit musical "The Shop Girl" (1894). The 21-year-old actor wrote the lyrics to his character's hit song "Beautiful, bountiful Bertie", which he popularised in both London and New York. He eventually appeared in some 20 Edwardes shows, often interpolating his own songs into the shows.
Grossmith left the musical stage for about three years, appearing in straight comedies, but he returned in 1898 to take over in the musical "Little Miss Nobody" and then as Mark Antony in the burlesque, "Great Caesar" (1899), which Grossmith had written with Paul Rubens. The piece was not successful, but he wrote another (also unsuccessful piece), "The Gay Pretenders" (1900), in which he included roles for both himself and his famous father, that played at the Globe Theatre with a cast also including John Coates, Frank Wyatt, Letty Lind and Richard Temple.
Grossmith then returned to Edwardes's company as leading comedian, touring in "Kitty Grey", and then starred in the Gaiety Theatre's hit "The Toreador" (1901). Grossmith supplied some of his own lyrics ("Archie") but scored his biggest hit with Rubens's song "Everybody's Awfully Good to Me." He then played in "The School Girl" (1903) and subsequently toured America in the piece, but he mostly remained at the Gaiety for the next dozen years, starring in a number of hits and becoming one of the biggest stars of the Edwardian era. His roles in these hits included The Hon. Guy Scrymgeour in "The Orchid" (1903), Gustave Babori in "The Spring Chicken" (1905), Genie of The Lamp in "The New Aladdin" (1906), Otto, the prince, in "The Girls of Gottenberg" (1907), Hughie in "Our Miss Gibbs" (1909), Auberon Blowand in "Peggy" (1911) and Lord Bicester in "The Sunshine Girl" (1912). He often performed together with diminutive comic Edmund Payne. From 1904, he was a Freemason.
Grossmith co-wrote the successful "Havana" (1908), while he moved to another Edwardes theatre to play Count Lothar in "A Waltz Dream". Grossmith was given writing credits for some of the Gaiety pieces, usually adaptations from French comedies (like "The Spring Chicken") or collaborations with other writers (such as "The Girls of Gottenberg"), but he wrote the libretto to "Peggy" on his own. His contributions in collaborative pieces were primarily to add in jokes. He adapted "The Dollar Princess" (1909) for America (but not London) and also co-wrote some of London's earliest "revues", including the "Rogues and Vagabonds", "Venus", "Oh! Indeed", Empire Theatre's "Hullo ... London!" (1910), "Everybody's Doing It", "Kill That Fly!", "Eight-pence a Mile", and "Not Likely". In addition to his writing and performing, he sometimes directed these musicals and revues.
Peak producing years.
In 1913, Grossmith starred in "The Girl on the Film" first in London and then in New York, where he joined with Edward Laurillard, who had earlier produced his musical "The Love Birds", to produce plays and musicals. Grossmith established himself as a major producer with Laurillard, bringing "Potash and Perlmutter", by Montague Glass, to London in 1914 for a long run at the Queen's Theatre. They then produced the successful "Tonight's the Night", based on the farce "Pink Dominoes", first at the Shubert Theatre in New York in 1914 and then moved it to the Gaiety Theatre, London in 1915. Grossmith played The Hon. Dudley Mitten.
Back at the Gaiety Theatre, Grossmith wrote, produced and starred in the hit "Theodore &amp; Co" (1916), based on a French comedy. Edwardes had died in 1915, however, and Grossmith was dissatisfied with the offer of the new management under Alfred Butt and Robert Evett, the executor of Edwardes's estate, and so he left the Gaiety and produced three successes, "Mr Manhattan", "Arlette" (1917), and "Yes, Uncle!" (1917) elsewhere. His "Oh! Joy (the British adaptation of Oh, Boy!, 1917)" was also successful. He also wrote the tremendously successful revue series, "The Bing Boys Are Here" (1916), "The Bing Girls are There" (1917) and "The Bing Boys on Broadway" (1918). Grossmith fitted his work on all these productions around his naval service in World War I.
Grossmith and Laurillard built their own theatre, the Winter Garden, on the site of an old music hall in Drury Lane. They opened the theatre in 1919 with Grossmith and Leslie Henson starring in "Kissing Time" (1919, with a star-studded cast, a book by P.G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton and music by Ivan Caryll), followed by "A Night Out" (1920). Grossmith and Laurillard also became managers of the Apollo Theatre in 1920 (they had produced "The Only Girl" there in 1916 and "Tilly of Bloomsbury" there in 1919). But expanding their operation caused Grossmith and Laurillard to end their partnership, with Grossmith retaining control of the Winter Garden.
Grossmith partnered with Edwardes's former associate, J. A. E. Malone, to produce a series of mostly adaptations of imported shows at the Winter Garden from 1921 to 1926: "Sally" (1921), "The Cabaret Girl" (1922, with book by Wodehouse and music by Jerome Kern), "The Beauty Prize" (1923, with Wodehouse and Kern), a revival of "Tonight's the Night" (1923), "Primrose" (1924, with music by George Gershwin), "Tell Me More" (1925, with words by Thompson and music by George Gershwin) and "Kid Boots" (1926 with music by Harry Tierney), many of them featuring Leslie Henson. Grossmith co-wrote some of the Winter Garden pieces, directed many of his own productions and starred in several, notably as Otis in "Sally". Several of the later productions lost money, and Grossmith and Malone ended the partnership.
Grossmith also co-produced Oscar Asche's conception of "Eastward Ho!" (1919), "Baby Bunting" (both in 1919) and "Faust on Toast" (1921) at other theatres during this period. At the same time, in the early 1920s, while appearing less frequently in his own Winter Garden shows, he continued to appear in other shows, including "The Naughty Princess" (1920), the title role in a revival of "The Gay Lord Quex" (1923) and as Billy Early in the original British production of "No, No, Nanette" (1925). Around this time, Grossmith also worked as a programme adviser to the BBC, particular involved in comedy programming. He also negotiated on behalf of the BBC with theatre managers over their boycott on songs from plays, when provincial theatre managers had threatened to cancel tour contracts if excerpts from the new plays had already been broadcast by the BBC.
In their joint memoir "Bring on the Girls!", P.G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton relate a story about Grossmith holding auditions for "Primrose". The young model-dancer-actress Sylvia Hawkes auditioned:
Later years and legacy.
After 1926, Grossmith stopped producing, but he continued to perform, playing King Christian in Albert Szirmai's "Princess Charming" (1926) for producer Robert Courtneidge in New York, and Britain in "The Five o'Clock Girl" and "Lady Mary" (1928). In New York in 1930, and later in London (where it flopped), he starred in Ralph Benatzky's "My Sister and I" (aka "Meet My Sister"). He also appeared in at least ten films for London Films in the 1930s. During a brief sojourn in Hollywood, he appeared in several films produced at the Fox Studios, including "Women Everywhere" (1930), for which he also supplied the story, and "Are You There?" (1930).
In 1931–32, Grossmith was appointed managing director of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, producing "The Land of Smiles" and "Cavalcade", but he resigned in 1932 to devote himself to cinema. In the 1930s, Grossmith appeared in (and wrote the screenplay, in two cases, for) a number of films. In 1933, he played Touchstone in a production of "As You Like It" in the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park. Also in 1933, he wrote a memoir called "G. G." The following year, he played Horner in "The Country Wife" at the Ambassadors Theatre.
According to musical theatre writer Andrew Lamb, Grossmith 
The Wodehouse scholar Norman Murphy believes that Grossmith was the inspiration for Bertie Wooster.
Grossmith died in a London nursing home at the age of 61. He never received his promised knighthood.

Majid Khan (detainee)

Majid Shoukat Khan (Urdu: ماجد شوکت خان, born February 28, 1980) is a Pakistani who was the only known legal resident of the United States held in the Guantanamo Bay Detainment Camp. He was a "high value detainee" and was tortured by U.S. intelligence forces.
Khan originally came to the United States in 1998, where he gained asylum. He lived in a suburb of Baltimore, Maryland where he attended high school and became radicalized. He returned to his native Pakistan after the 9/11 attacks to join Al Qaeda and worked for them as a courier, according to the BBC, "The Progressive", and the "New York Times". Pakistani authorities captured him in 2003 and handed him over to the CIA who held him incognito in a black site in Afghanistan, interrogating him and subjecting him to “the most horrific torture.” In 2006 he was sent to Guantanamo, where in 2012 he pleaded guilty to conspiracy and the murder of 11 innocent civilians in the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta, Indonesia, and also for the attempted assassination of Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf. He also began cooperating with the U.S. government. In 2021 he was sentenced by Guantanamo Military Commission retroactively to 26 years in prison. His sentence was completed on March 1, 2022, and after Belize agreed to accept him he was released from Guantanamo Bay to that country on February 2, 2023.
Early life.
Khan's family settled in Catonsville, Maryland, near Baltimore, where he attended Owings Mills High School and was "exposed to radical Islam". He was granted asylum in the U.S. in 1998, and graduated the following year.
In 2002, Khan returned to Pakistan, where he married 18-year-old Rabia Yaqoub.
According to Deborah Scroggins, author of "", Khan had become more religious, after his mother's death, and had asked his aunt to help him find a wife who was also a religious scholar. Rabia was one of his aunt's students. According to the New York Times, it was then he became a courier for Al Qaeda.
He returned to the United States for a short period to continue his work as a database administrator in a Maryland government office. He claims that he helped the FBI investigate and arrest an illegal immigrant from Pakistan during this time.
On December 25, 2002, Aafia Siddiqui made a trip from Pakistan to the U.S., saying that she was looking for a job. She left the U.S. on January 2, 2003. The FBI suspects that the real purpose of her trip was to open a P.O. box for Khan. Siddiqui registered Khan as co-owner of the box, claiming he was her husband. The key to the box was later found held by Uzair Paracha, who was convicted of providing material support to al-Qaeda and was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison in 2006; fifteen years after his arrest, Uzair's conviction was deemed void on July 3, 2018, by Judge Sidney H. Stein, based on newly discovered statements made by Ammar al-Baluchi, Majid Khan (detainee) and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, bringing his involvement and intentions into question. 
Arrest and detention.
Khan returned to Pakistan on March 5, 2003. He, his brother Mohammed, and other relatives were arrested at their residence in Karachi by Pakistani security agents and taken into custody. Khan and his family were taken to an unknown location. After about a month, the entire family, with the exception of Khan, was released. Rabia Khan and the rest of his family heard nothing of his whereabouts for three years. Then, in September 2006, President George W. Bush announced that Khan, along with 13 other so-called "high value detainees", had been transferred from secret CIA prisons to military custody at Guantánamo Bay detention camp to await prosecution under the new military tribunal system authorized by the Military Commissions Act of 2006.
Legal issues.
Khan was the first of the fourteen high-value detainees to challenge his detention in court. The Center for Constitutional Rights filed the "habeas corpus" challenge on October 5, 2006 — before President Bush signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 into law.
But, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 restricted detainees from mounting challenges through U.S. courts and was retroactive. The Center for Constitutional Rights and others argued against this act before the U.S. Supreme Court in "Boumediene v. Bush" on December 5, 2007. Justice Kennedy held in the case that the MCA could not deny detainees and other petitioners, including Khan, their right to petition United States courts for writ of "habeas corpus".
Allegations.
In the government's account, Khan was exposed to a radicalized element of Islam while in the United States. Khan allegedly began attending secret prayer meetings at Baltimore's Islamic Society, where he was recruited by individuals who sought out disaffected young people. U.S. officials assert that Khan's first trip to Pakistan connected him to family members affiliated with Al-Qaeda. According to officials, these family members introduced Khan to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM), the man accused of orchestrating the September 11, 2001 attacks. Allegedly Mohammed later enlisted Khan in helping to support and plan terrorist attacks against the U.S. and Israel.
Government officials assert that Khan, under KSM's tutelage, was being trained to blow up gas stations and poison water reservoirs, and that he plotted to assassinate Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf. Khan's job at the family gas station played a role in the suspicions of U.S. intelligence analysts that he was part of a plot to blow up parts of the U.S. petroleum infrastructure. The U.S. government contends that Khan was aware that his visit to family in Pakistan in 2002 violated the terms of his asylum granted in 1998.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) asserted that Khan helped Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (mastermind of the September 11th attacks) plan attacks against gas stations and water reservoirs in the United States. ODNI alleges Khan was first introduced to al Qaeda through family and that Khan's experience working in his family's gas station "made Khan highly qualified to assist Mohammad with the research and planning to blow up gas stations."
Legal challenge to government.
Khan's attorneys at the Center for Constitutional Rights insist that he was tortured, subjected to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, and coerced into making false and unreliable confessions.
Khan's appeal points out that although he had been in U.S. custody for more than three and a half years, he had never had any kind of review of the legality of his detention. Khan's attorneys at CCR petitioned to have his case tried in civilian court in the United States instead of by military tribunal at Guantanamo. A federal appeals court ruled in February 2007 that detainees at Guantanamo Bay could not use the U.S. court system to challenge their indefinite imprisonment.
Access to legal counsel.
The Center for Constitutional Rights argued against the government's efforts to deny CCR attorneys access to Khan in a response brief filed November 3, 2006. In the brief, CCR argued that efforts by the Bush administration to deny Khan access to counsel, "ignores the Court's historical function under Article III of the Constitution to exercise its independent judgment," and used its classification authority to hide illegal conduct when the court had sufficient tools to prevent disclosure of sensitive classified information.
On November 4, 2006, the Justice Department said that Khan should not be allowed to speak to an attorney because he might "reveal the agency's closely guarded interrogation techniques".
James Friedman, a professor at the Maine School of Law, wrote that the Bush administration is arguing that Khan, and the other high-value detainees held in the Black Sites, should be gagged from talking about the interrogation techniques they were exposed to, even when talking privately to their own lawyers.
Friedman pointed out, "His combatant status was never reviewed as required by the U.S. Supreme Court in "Hamdi v. Rumsfeld" (2004) nor as outlined in the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005."
If specific alternative techniques were disclosed, it would permit terrorist organizations to adapt their training to counter the tactics that C.I.A. can employ in interrogations.
Habeas corpus submission.
Khan is one of 16 Guantanamo captives whose amalgamated habeas corpus submissions were heard by U.S. District Court Judge Reggie B. Walton on January 31, 2007.
Walton ruled that the cases be administratively closed (or stayed) until the District of Columbia Circuit resolved the issue of jurisdiction.
Pakistan's "International News" reported Khan's wife's lawyer told the Sindh High Court that she was not informed that Khan was in U.S. custody for the first three years after he disappeared.
Timeline of Majid Khan's Combatant Status Review Tribunal.
The press release quoted from Gitanjali Gutierrez, Khan's lawyer:
According to the press release, Khan's Tribunal was scheduled to start on April 10, 2007, and to finish by April 13, 2007. Ali Khan made the affidavit on April 6, 2007, when the family confirmed they would not be allowed to testify in person.
According to Department of Defense spokesman Commander Jeffrey Gordon, Khan's Tribunal concluded April 15, 2007.
The Department of Defense announced on August 9, 2007 that all 14 of the "high-value detainees" who had been transferred to Guantanamo from the CIA's black sites, had been officially classified as "enemy combatants". Although judges Peter Brownback and Keith J. Allred had ruled two months earlier that only ""illegal" enemy combatants" could face military commissions, the Department of Defense waived the qualifier and said that all 14 men could now face charges before Guantanamo military commissions.
Legal action.
First meeting with a lawyer.
On October 15, 2007, Gitanjali Gutierrez, a CCR attorney, wrote about her pending first meeting with Majid Khan. Khan was the first of the "high value detainees" to meet with a lawyer.
Order to preserve evidence.
In December 2007, a Federal appeals court in Washington DC ordered the Department of Defense to preserve evidence in Khan's case. The motion predated reporting that, contrary to earlier claims by the government, the CIA had taped the interrogations of Abu Zubaydah and Abdul Al Nashiri, including their waterboarding in 2002, and destroyed those tapes. A court order of late 2005 had ordered the government not to destroy such evidence. In an e-mail to "The Washington Post" Wells Dixon, one of Khan's lawyers, wrote:
The CIA denied that it had tortured Khan or any other captive. Dixon said:
"The Baltimore Sun" quoted a CIA spokesman, George Little, who repeated that the CIA stood by its assertion that it had stopped videotaping captives' interrogations in 2002. But Khan's lawyers said their client's interrogations had been taped more recently than that.
Motion to declare torture.
A motion filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights was declassified in redacted form in December 2007. This motion aims for the Court of Appeals to declare that interrogation methods used against Majid Khan by the CIA "constitute torture and other forms of impermissible coercion."
The government's response to the motion was due to the court on December 20, 2009.
The CCR attorneys Dixon Wells and Gita S. Gutierrez released some of their declassified notes from their conversations with Majid Khan in November 2007. They included the following: 
Petition of habeas corpus.
A petition of habeas corpus was filed on Khan's behalf on September 29, 2006.
On July 22, 2008, J. Wells Dixon, Gitanjali S. Gutierrez, Shayana D. Kadidal, of the Center for Constitutional Rights, filed a "petitioner's status report" on behalf of Majid Khan, in Civil Action No. 06-1690, "Majid Khan v. George W. Bush".
On August 1, 2008, Dixon filed a "Motion for Order directing the Court Security Office to file supplemental status report". He wrote that a Detainee Treatment Act appeal had been initiated on Khan's behalf. His motion said that in contrast to other captives' DTA appeals, the Department of Justice was not agreeing to allow exculpatory information prepared for his appeal to be made available for use on his habeas petition.
Declaration of sentence completed.
Via "The Guantánamo Docket" published by the "New York Times":
A senior Pentagon official declared his sentence complete on March 1, 2022. His lawyers argue that expiration of his sentence means he should be promptly released, although the U.S. had yet to reach a deal with a country to receive him.
Accusations against U.S..
Iyman Faris told authorities that Khan had referred to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as an "uncle" and spoken of a desire to kill Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf. Faris later said that his accusations had been "an absolute lie" that he had been coerced into making.
Khan made repeated offers to submit to a polygraph test to prove his innocence, but was turned down.
Khan was represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights and is one of few so-called "high value detainees" to have legal representation. He has attempted suicide six times while in detention. He complained in writing of having his beard forcibly shaved (in violation of his religious practice) and spending weeks without sunlight; he also complained that detainees are expected to wash with "cheap branded, unscented soap", and that he is forced to read the "poor quality" Joint Task Force Guantanamo's weekly newsletter "The Wire".
Letters from Guantanamo.
Khan is the first of the 14 high-value detainees to get mail to his relatives. "The Washington Post" reported that four letters from Khan had been received, three to his relatives in Maryland, and one to his wife. The letters were delivered to his family through the International Committee of the Red Cross. Its contact with detainees is contingent on the agency's promise not to publicly disclose any information received during the meetings, which is its standard process.
Khan's letter to his wife was written in Urdu and was published on the BBC's Urdu web site. Khan's Maryland relatives also decided to make the letters public to bring more attention to his case. These letters, written on December 17, 2007, and December 21, 2007, were made public on January 18, 2008. The letters were filed as part of a petition in the Washington DC Federal Court of Appeal. The petition asks the court "to rule that he was tortured in U.S. custody." According to "The Washington Post", Khan's letters were heavily redacted by military censors.
Khan wrote that he was in solitary confinement, but he could talk to nearby captives through the cell walls. Once a day he is permitted to leave his cell "to get sunburn" during an hour of solitary access in an exercise yard. His relatives said the letters showed he had become much more religious.
According to "The Baltimore Sun":
Other quotes from Khan's letters include:
"The Baltimore Sun" reported that Khan said that when he lived in the United States, he paid $2,400 per month in U.S. taxes. It also reported that the only other captive he had any contact with since he arrived in Guantanamo was Abu Zubaydah.
Pakistani cooperation.
In 2006, Khalid Khawaja, a spokesman for the Pakistani human rights group Defense of Human Rights, cited the examples of Majid Khan and Saifullah Paracha as proof that the Pakistani government had lied about whether it had handed over Pakistani citizens to the U.S. The Associated Press quotes Khawaja as stating that: "Pakistan has sold its own people to the United States for dollars."
Khaled el-Masri, a citizen of Germany held for five months in the CIA black site in Afghanistan known as the "Salt Pit" in 2003 and 2004, a victim of mistaken identity, reported that Majid Khan was one of his fellow captives there.
Related case.
In September 2006, Uzair Paracha, the son of Saifullah Paracha, another Guantanamo detainee, was tried and convicted of terrorism charges in a U.S. court. Paracha had requested Majid Khan as a witness. The U.S. government declined to produce him, although he was in U.S. custody.
Enhanced interrogation techniques.
According to Khan, during his time imprisoned by the CIA, "the more I cooperated, the more I was tortured", and so he made up lies in order to appease interrogators. In the CIA black site, which he described as resembling a dungeon, "he was kept naked with a hood on his head, his arms chained in ways that made sleep impossible".
On March 13, 2008, the CIA released highly redacted documents from a Combatant Status Review Tribunal in which Khan describes abuse and torture he suffered in CIA custody.
The Senate Intelligence Committee's C.I.A. Torture Report, released December 9, 2014, revealed that Khan was one of the detainees subjected to "rectal feeding", which his lawyers described as a form of rape, as part of his ″torture regime″ at the black site prison. Khan's "lunch tray", consisting of hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts, and raisins was pureed and rectally infused," says the report.
Release and life in Belize.
Sentence completion and release.
On June 7, 2022, lawyers for Khan petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a writ of "habeas corpus". The petition asked the United States "inter alia" to release him from his unlawful detention in Guantanamo and for the United States to comply with their non-refoulement obligations under international law for relocation to anywhere but his native Pakistan.
On 25 July 2022 the New York Times published that "a senior Pentagon official declared" Khan's sentence was completed on March 1, 2022, Khan was transferred to Belize on February 2, 2023.
Belize.
Belize’s foreign minister called its agreement to settle Khan along with his wife and their teenage daughter “a humanitarian act”. Belize had required that the US government provide funds to buy Khan "a home, a phone, a laptop and a car".
In Belize, Khan issued a statement saying:

Hadley cell

The Hadley cell, also known as the Hadley circulation, is a global-scale tropical atmospheric circulation that features air rising near the equator, flowing poleward near the tropopause at a height of above the Earth's surface, cooling and descending in the subtropics at around 25 degrees latitude, and then returning equatorward near the surface. It is a thermally direct circulation within the troposphere that emerges due to differences in insolation and heating between the tropics and the subtropics. On a yearly average, the circulation is characterized by a circulation cell on each side of the equator. The Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell is slightly stronger on average than its northern counterpart, extending slightly beyond the equator into the Northern Hemisphere. During the summer and winter months, the Hadley circulation is dominated by a single, cross-equatorial cell with air rising in the summer hemisphere and sinking in the winter hemisphere. Analogous circulations may occur in extraterrestrial atmospheres, such as on Venus and Mars.
Global climate is greatly influenced by the structure and behavior of the Hadley circulation. The prevailing trade winds are a manifestation of the lower branches of the Hadley circulation, converging air and moisture in the tropics to form the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) where the Earth's heaviest rains are located. Shifts in the ITCZ associated with the seasonal variability of the Hadley circulation cause monsoons. The sinking branches of the Hadley cells give rise to the oceanic subtropical ridges and suppress rainfall; many of the Earth's deserts and arid regions are located in the subtropics coincident with the position of the sinking branches. The Hadley circulation is also a key mechanism for the meridional transport of heat, angular momentum and moisture, contributing to the subtropical jet stream, the moist tropics and maintaining a global thermal equilibrium.
The Hadley circulation is named after George Hadley, who in 1735 postulated the existence of hemisphere-spanning circulation cells driven by differences in heating to explain the trade winds. Other scientists later developed similar arguments or critiqued Hadley's qualitative theory, providing more rigorous explanations and formalism. The existence of a broad meridional circulation of the type suggested by Hadley was confirmed in the mid-20th century once routine observations of the upper troposphere became available via radiosondes. Observations and climate modelling indicate that the Hadley circulation has expanded poleward since at least the 1980s as a result of climate change, with an accompanying but less certain intensification of the circulation; these changes have been associated with trends in regional weather patterns. Model projections suggest that the circulation will widen and weaken throughout the 21st century due to climate change.
Mechanism and characteristics.
The Hadley circulation describes the broad, thermally direct and meridional overturning of air within the troposphere over the low latitudes. Within the global atmospheric circulation, the meridional flow of air averaged along lines of latitude are organized into circulations of rising and sinking motions coupled with the equatorward or poleward movement of air called meridional cells. These include the prominent "Hadley cells" centered over the tropics and the weaker "Ferrel cells" centered over the mid-latitudes. The Hadley cells result from the contrast of insolation between the warm equatorial regions and the cooler subtropical regions. The uneven heating of Earth's surface results in regions of rising and descending air. Over the course of a year, the equatorial regions absorb more radiation from the Sun than they radiate away. At higher latitudes, the Earth emits more radiation than it receives from the Sun. Without a mechanism to exchange heat meridionally, the equatorial regions would warm and the higher latitudes would cool progressively in disequilibrium. The broad ascent and descent of air results in a pressure gradient force that drives the Hadley circulation and other large-scale flows in both the atmosphere and the ocean, distributing heat and maintaining a global long-term and subseasonal thermal equilibrium.
The Hadley circulation covers almost half of the Earth's surface area, spanning from roughly the Tropic of Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn. Vertically, the circulation occupies the entire depth of the troposphere. The Hadley cells comprising the circulation consist of air carried equatorward by the trade winds in the lower troposphere that ascends when heated near the equator, along with air moving poleward in the upper troposphere. Air that is moved into the subtropics cools and then sinks before returning equatorward to the tropics; the position of the sinking air associated with the Hadley cell is often used as a measure of the meridional width of the global tropics. The equatorward return of air and the strong influence of heating make the Hadley cell a thermally driven and enclosed circulation. Due to the buoyant rise of air near the equator and the sinking of air at higher latitudes, a pressure gradient develops near the surface with lower pressures near the equator and higher pressures in the subtropics; this provides the motive force for the equatorward flow in the lower troposphere. However, the release of latent heat associated with condensation in the tropics also relaxes the decrease in pressure with height, resulting in higher pressures aloft in the tropics compared to the subtropics for a given height in the upper troposphere; this pressure gradient is stronger than its near-surface counterpart and provides the motive force for the poleward flow in the upper troposphere. Hadley cells are most commonly identified using the mass-weighted, zonally averaged stream function of meridional winds, but they can also be identified by other measurable or derivable physical parameters such as velocity potential or the vertical component of wind at a particular pressure level.
Given the latitude formula_1 and the pressure level formula_2, the Stokes stream function characterizing the Hadley circulation is given by
where formula_4 is the radius of Earth, formula_5 is the acceleration due to the gravity of Earth, and formula_6 is the zonally averaged meridional wind at the prescribed latitude and pressure level. The value of formula_7 gives the integrated meridional mass flux between the specified pressure level and the top of the Earth's atmosphere, with positive values indicating northward mass transport. The strength of the Hadley cells can be quantified based on formula_7 including the maximum and minimum values or averages of the stream function both overall and at various pressure levels. Hadley cell intensity can also be assessed using other physical quantities such as the velocity potential, vertical component of wind, transport of water vapor, or total energy of the circulation.
Structure and components.
The structure of the Hadley circulation and its components can be inferred by graphing zonal and temporal averages of global winds throughout the troposphere. At shorter timescales, individual weather systems perturb wind flow. Although the structure of the Hadley circulation varies seasonally, when winds are averaged annually (from an Eulerian perspective) the Hadley circulation is roughly symmetric and composed of two similar Hadley cells with one in each of the Northern and Southern hemispheres, sharing a common region of ascending air near the equator; however, the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell is stronger. The winds associated with the annually averaged Hadley circulation are on the order of . However, when averaging the motions of air parcels as opposed to the winds at fixed locations (a Lagrangian perspective), the Hadley circulation manifests as a broader circulation that extends farther poleward. Each Hadley cell can be described by four primary branches of airflow within the tropics:
The trade winds in the low latitudes of both Earth's Northern and Southern hemispheres converge air towards the equator, due to a belt of low atmospheric pressure exhibiting abundant storms and heavy rainfall known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This equatorward movement of air near the Earth's surface constitutes the lower branch of the Hadley cell. The position of the ITCZ is influenced by the warmth of sea surface temperatures (SST) near the equator and the strength of cross-equatorial pressure gradients. In general, the ITCZ is located near the equator or is offset towards the summer hemisphere where the warmest SSTs are located. On an annual average, the rising branch of the Hadley circulation is slightly offset towards the Northern Hemisphere, away from the equator. Due to the Coriolis force, the trade winds deflect opposite the direction of Earth's rotation, blowing partially westward rather than directly equatorward in both hemispheres. The lower branch accrues moisture resulting from evaporation across Earth's tropical oceans. A warmer environment and converging winds force the moistened air to ascend near the equator, resulting in the rising branch of the Hadley cell. The upward motion is further enhanced by the release of latent heat as the uplift of moist air results in an equatorial band of condensation and precipitation. The Hadley circulation's upward branch largely occurs in thunderstorms occupying only around one percent of the surface area of the tropics. The transport of heat in the Hadley circulation's ascending branch is accomplished most efficiently by hot towers—cumulonimbus clouds bearing strong updrafts that do not mix in drier air commonly found in the middle troposphere and thus allow the movement of air from the highly moist tropical lower troposphere into the upper troposphere. Approximately 1,500–5,000 hot towers daily near the ITCZ region are required to sustain the vertical heat transport exhibited by the Hadley circulation.
The ascent of air rises into the upper troposphere to a height of , after which air diverges outward from the ITCZ and towards the poles. The top of the Hadley cell is set by the height of the tropopause as the stable stratosphere above prevents the continued ascent of air. Air arising from the low latitudes has higher absolute angular momentum about Earth's axis of rotation. The distance between the atmosphere and Earth's axis decreases poleward; to conserve angular momentum, poleward-moving air parcels must accelerate eastward. The Coriolis effect limits the poleward extent of the Hadley circulation, accelerating air in the direction of the Earth's rotation and forming a jet stream directed zonally rather than continuing the poleward flow of air at each Hadley cell's poleward boundary. Considering only the conservation of angular momentum, a parcel of air at rest along the equator would accelerate to a zonal speed of by the time it reached 30° latitude. However, small-scale turbulence along the parcel's poleward trek and large-scale eddies in the mid-latitude dissipate angular momentum. The jet associated with the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell is stronger than its northern counterpart due to the stronger intensity of the Southern Hemisphere cell. The cooler, higher latitudes leads to cooling of air parcels, which causes the poleward air to eventually descend. When the movement of air is averaged annually, the descending branch of the Hadley cell is located roughly over the 25th parallel north and the 25th parallel south. The moisture in the subtropics is then partly advected poleward by eddies and partly advected equatorward by the lower branch of the Hadley cell, where it is later brought towards the ITCZ. Although the zonally averaged Hadley cell is organized into four main branches, these branches are aggregations of more concentrated air flows and regions of mass transport.
Several theories and physical models have attempted to explain the latitudinal width of the Hadley cell. The Held–Hou Model provides one theoretical constraint on the meridional extent of the Hadley cells. By assuming a simplified atmosphere composed of a lower layer subject to friction from the Earth's surface and an upper layer free from friction, the model predicts that the Hadley circulation would be restricted to within of the equator if parcels do not have any net heating within the circulation. According to the Held–Hou Model, the latitude of the Hadley cell's poleward edge formula_1 scales according to
where formula_11 is the difference in potential temperature between the equator and the pole in radiative equilibrium, formula_12 is the height of the tropopause, formula_13 is the Earth's rotation rate, and formula_14 is a reference potential temperature. Other compatible models posit that the width of the Hadley cell may scale with other physical parameters such as the vertically averaged Brunt–Väisälä frequency in the tropopshere or the growth rate of baroclinic waves shed by the cell.
Seasonality and variability.
The Hadley circulation varies considerably with seasonal changes. Around the equinox during the spring and autumn for either the northern or southern hemisphere, the Hadley circulation takes the form of two relatively weaker Hadley cells in both hemispheres, sharing a common region of ascent over the ITCZ and moving air aloft towards each cell's respective hemisphere. However, closer to the solstices, the Hadley circulation transitions into a more singular and stronger cross-equatorial Hadley cell with air rising in the summer hemisphere and broadly descending in the winter hemisphere. The transition between the two-cell and single-cell configuration is abrupt, and during most of the year the Hadley circulation is characterized by a single dominant Hadley cell that transports air across the equator. In this configuration, the ascending branch is located in the tropical latitudes of the warmer summer hemisphere and the descending branch is positioned in the subtropics of the cooler winter hemisphere. Two cells are still present in each hemisphere, though the winter hemisphere's cell becomes much more prominent while the summer hemisphere's cell becomes displaced poleward. The intensification of the winter hemisphere's cell is associated with a steepening of gradients in geopotential height, leading to an acceleration of trade winds and stronger meridional flows. The presence of continents relaxes temperature gradients in the summer hemisphere, accentuating the contrast between the hemispheric Hadley cells. Reanalysis data from 1979–2001 indicated that the dominant Hadley cell in boreal summer extended from 13°S to 31°N on average. In both boreal and austral winters, the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean contribute most to the rising and sinking motions in the zonally averaged Hadley circulation. However, vertical flows over Africa and the Americas are more marked in boreal winter.
At longer interannual timescales, variations in the Hadley circulation are associated with variations in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which impacts the positioning of the ascending branch; the response of the circulation to ENSO is non-linear, with a more marked response to El Niño events than La Niña events. During El Niño, the Hadley circulation strengthens due to the increased warmth of the upper troposphere over the tropical Pacific and the resultant intensification of poleward flow. However, these changes are not asymmetric, during the same events, the Hadley cells over the western Pacific and the Atlantic are weakened. During the Atlantic Niño, the circulation over the Atlantic is intensified. The Atlantic circulation is also enhanced during periods when the North Atlantic oscillation is strongly positive. The variation in the seasonally averaged and annually averaged Hadley circulation from year to year is largely accounted for by two juxtaposed modes of oscillation: an equatorial symmetric mode characterized by single cell straddling the equator and an equatorial symmetric mode characterized by two cells on either side of the equator.
Energetics and transport.
The Hadley cell is an important mechanism by which moisture and energy are transported both between the tropics and subtropics and between the Northern and Southern hemispheres. However, it is not an efficient transporter of energy due to the opposing flows of the lower and upper branch, with the lower branch transporting sensible and latent heat equatorward and the upper branch transporting potential energy poleward. The resulting net energy transport poleward represents around 10 percent of the overall energy transport involved in the Hadley cell. The descending branch of the Hadley cell generates clear skies and a surplus of evaporation relative to precipitation in the subtropics. The lower branch of the Hadley circulation accomplishes most of the transport of the excess water vapor accumulated in the subtropical atmosphere towards the equatorial region. The strong Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell relative to its northern counterpart leads to a small net energy transport from the northern to the southern hemisphere; as a result, the transport of energy at the equator is directed southward on average, with an annual net transport of around 0.1 PW. In contrast to the higher latitudes where eddies are the dominant mechanism for transporting energy poleward, the meridional flows imposed by the Hadley circulation are the primary mechanism for poleward energy transport in the tropics. As a thermally direct circulation, the Hadley circulation converts available potential energy to the kinetic energy of horizontal winds. Based on data from January 1979 and December 2010, the Hadley circulation has an average power output of 198 TW, with maxima in January and August and minima in May and October. Although the stability of the tropopause largely limits the movement of air from the troposphere to the stratosphere, some tropospheric air penetrates into the stratosphere via the Hadley cells.
The Hadley circulation may be idealized as a heat engine converting heat energy into mechanical energy. As air moves towards the equator near the Earth's surface, it accumulates entropy from the surface either by direct heating or the flux of sensible or latent heat. In the ascending branch of a Hadley cell, the ascent of air is approximately an adiabatic process with respect to the surrounding environment. However, as parcels of air move equatorward in the cell's upper branch, they lose entropy by radiating heat to space at infrared wavelengths and descend in response. This radiative cooling occurs at a rate of at least 60  W m−2 and may exceed 100 W m−2 in winter. The heat accumulated during the equatorward branch of the circulation is greater than the heat lost in the upper poleward branch; the excess heat is converted into the mechanical energy that drives the movement of air. This difference in heating also results in the Hadley circulation transporting heat poleward as the air supplying the Hadley cell's upper branch has greater moist static energy than the air supplying the cell's lower branch. Within the Earth's atmosphere, the timescale at which air parcels lose heat due to radiative cooling and the timescale at which air moves along the Hadley circulation are at similar orders of magnitude, allowing the Hadley circulation to transport heat despite cooling in the circulation's upper branch. Air with high potential temperature is ultimately moved poleward in the upper troposphere while air with lower potential temperature is brought equatorward near the surface. As a result, the Hadley circulation is one mechanism by which the disequilibrium produced by uneven heating of the Earth is brought towards equilibrium. When considered as a heat engine, the thermodynamic efficiency of the Hadley circulation averaged around 2.6 percent between 1979 and 2010, with small seasonal variability.
The Hadley circulation also transports planetary angular momentum poleward due to Earth's rotation. Because the trade winds are directed opposite the Earth's rotation, eastward angular momentum is transferred to the atmosphere via frictional interaction between the winds and topography. The Hadley cell then transfers this angular momentum through its upward and poleward branches. The poleward branch accelerates and is deflected east in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres due to the Coriolis force and the conservation of angular momentum, resulting in a zonal jet stream above the descending branch of the Hadley cell. The formation of such a jet implies the existence of a thermal wind balance supported by the amplification of temperature gradients in the jet's vicinity resulting from the Hadley circulation's poleward heat advection. The subtropical jet in the upper troposphere coincides with where the Hadley cell meets the Ferrel cell. The strong wind shear accompanying the jet presents a significant source of baroclinic instability from which waves grow; the growth of these waves transfers heat and momentum polewards. Atmospheric eddies extract westerly angular momentum from the Hadley cell and transport it downward, resulting in the mid-latitude westerly winds.
Formulation and discovery.
The broad structure and mechanism of the Hadley circulation—comprising convective cells moving air due to temperature differences in a manner influenced by the Earth's rotation—was first proposed by Edmund Halley in 1685 and George Hadley in 1735. Hadley had sought to explain the physical mechanism for the trade winds and the westerlies; the Hadley circulation and the Hadley cells are named in honor of his pioneering work. Although Hadley's ideas invoked physical concepts that would not be formalized until well after his death, his model was largely qualitative and without mathematical rigor. Hadley's formulation was later recognized by most meteorologists by the 1920s to be a simplification of more complicated atmospheric processes. The Hadley circulation may have been the first attempt to explain the global distribution of winds in Earth's atmosphere using physical processes. However, Hadley's hypothesis could not be verified without observations of winds in the upper atmosphere. Data collected by routine radiosondes beginning in the mid-20th century confirmed the existence of the Hadley circulation.
Early explanations of the trade winds.
In the 15th and 16th centuries, observations of maritime weather conditions were of considerable importance to maritime transport. Compilations of these observations showed consistent weather conditions from year to year and significant seasonal variability. The prevalence of dry conditions and weak winds at around 30° latitude and the equatorward trade winds closer to the equator, mirrored in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, was apparent by 1600. Early efforts by scientists to explain aspects of global wind patterns often focused on the trade winds as the steadiness of the winds was assumed to portend a simple physical mechanism. Galileo Galilei proposed that the trade winds resulted from the atmosphere lagging behind the Earth's faster tangential rotation speed in the low latitudes, resulting in the westward trades directed opposite of Earth's rotation.
In 1685, English polymath Edmund Halley proposed at a debate organized by the Royal Society that the trade winds resulted from east to west temperature differences produced over the course of a day within the tropics. In Halley's model, as the Earth rotated, the location of maximum heating from the Sun moved west across the Earth's surface. This would cause air to rise, and by conservation of mass, Halley argued that air would be moved to the region of evacuated air, generating the trade winds. Halley's hypothesis was criticized by his friends, who noted that his model would lead to changing wind directions throughout the course of a day rather than the steady trade winds. Halley conceded in personal correspondence with John Wallis that "Your questioning my hypothesis for solving the Trade Winds makes me less confident of the truth thereof". Nonetheless, Halley's formulation was incorporated into "Chambers's Encyclopaedia" and "La Grande Encyclopédie", becoming the most widely known explanation for the trade winds until the early 19th century. Though his explanation of the trade winds was incorrect, Halley correctly predicted that the surface trade winds should be accompanied by an opposing flow aloft following mass conservation.
George Hadley's explanation.
Unsatisfied with preceding explanations for the trade winds, George Hadley proposed an alternate mechanism in 1735. Hadley's hypothesis was published in the paper "On the Cause of the General Trade Winds" in "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society". Like Halley, Hadley's explanation viewed the trade winds as a manifestation of air moving to take the place of rising warm air. However, the region of rising air prompting this flow lay along the lower latitudes. Understanding that the tangential rotation speed of the Earth was fastest at the equator and slowed farther poleward, Hadley conjectured that as air with lower momentum from higher latitudes moved equatorward to replace the rising air, it would conserve its momentum and thus curve west. By the same token, the rising air with higher momentum would spread poleward, curving east and then sinking as it cooled to produce westerlies in the mid-latitudes. Hadley's explanation implied the existence of hemisphere-spanning circulation cells in the Northern and Southern hemispheres extending from the equator to the poles, though he relied on an idealization of Earth's atmosphere that lacked seasonality or the asymmetries of the oceans and continents. His model also predicted rapid easterly trade winds of around , though he argued that the action of surface friction over the course of a few days slowed the air to the observed wind speeds. Colin Maclaurin extended Hadley's model to the ocean in 1740, asserting that meridional ocean currents were subject to similar westward or eastward deflections.
Hadley was not widely associated with his theory due to conflation with his older brother, John Hadley, and Halley; his theory failed to gain much traction in the scientific community for over a century due to its unintuitive explanation and the lack of validating observations. Several other natural philosophers independently forwarded explanations for the global distribution of winds soon after Hadley's 1735 proposal. In 1746, Jean le Rond d'Alembert provided a mathematical formulation for global winds, but disregarded solar heating and attributed the winds to the gravitational effects of the Sun and Moon. Immanuel Kant, also unsatisfied with Halley's explanation for the trade winds, published an explanation for the trade winds and westerlies in 1756 with similar reasoning as Hadley. In the latter part of the 18th century, Pierre-Simon Laplace developed a set of equations establishing a direct influence of Earth's rotation on wind direction. Swiss scientist Jean-André Deluc published an explanation of the trade winds in 1787 similar to Hadley's hypothesis, connecting differential heating and the Earth's rotation with the direction of the winds.
English chemist John Dalton was the first to clearly credit Hadley's explanation of the trade winds to George Hadley, mentioning Hadley's work in his 1793 book "Meteorological Observations and Essays". In 1837, "Philosophical Magazine" published a new theory of wind currents developed by Heinrich Wilhelm Dove without reference to Hadley but similarly explaining the direction of the trade winds as being influenced by the Earth's rotation. In response, Dalton later wrote a letter to the editor to the journal promoting Hadley's work. Dove subsequently credited Hadley so frequently that the overarching theory became known as the "Hadley–Dove principle", popularizing Hadley's explanation for the trade winds in Germany and Great Britain.
Critique of Hadley's explanation.
The work of Gustave Coriolis, William Ferrel, Jean Bernard Foucault and Henrik Mohn in the 19th century helped establish the Coriolis force as the mechanism for the deflection of winds due to Earth's rotation, emphasizing the conservation of angular momentum in directing flows rather than the conservation of linear momentum as Hadley suggested; Hadley's assumption led to an underestimation of the deflection by a factor of two. The acceptance of the Coriolis force in shaping global winds led to debate among German atmospheric scientists beginning in the 1870s over the completeness and validity of Hadley's explanation, which narrowly explained the behavior of initially meridional motions. Hadley's use of surface friction to explain why the trade winds were much slower than his theory would predict was seen as a key weakness in his ideas. The southwesterly motions observed in cirrus clouds at around 30°N further discounted Hadley's theory as their movement was far slower than the theory would predict when accounting for the conservation of angular momentum. In 1899, William Morris Davis, a professor of physical geography at Harvard University, gave a speech at the Royal Meteorological Society criticizing Hadley's theory for its failure to account for the transition of an initially unbalanced flow to geostrophic balance. Davis and other meteorologists in the 20th century recognized that the movement of air parcels along Hadley's envisaged circulation was sustained by a constant interplay between the pressure gradient and Coriolis forces rather than the conservation of angular momentum alone. Ultimately, while the atmospheric science community considered the general ideas of Hadley's principle valid, his explanation was viewed as a simplification of more complex physical processes.
Hadley's model of the global atmospheric circulation being characterized by hemisphere-wide circulation cells was also challenged by weather observations showing a zone of high pressure in the subtropics and a belt of low pressure at around 60° latitude. This pressure distribution would imply a poleward flow near the surface in the mid-latitudes rather than an equatorward flow implied by Hadley's envisioned cells. Ferrel and James Thomson later reconciled the pressure pattern with Hadley's model by proposing a circulation cell limited to lower altitudes in the mid-latitudes and nestled within the broader, hemisphere-wide Hadley cells. Carl-Gustaf Rossby proposed in 1947 that the Hadley circulation was limited to the tropics, forming one part of a dynamically driven and multi-celled meridional flow. Rossby's model resembled that of a similar three-celled model developed by Ferrel in 1860.
Direct observation.
The three-celled model of the global atmospheric circulation—with Hadley's conceived circulation forming its tropical component—had been widely accepted by the meteorological community by the early 20th century. However, the Hadley cell's existence was only validated by weather observations near the surface, and its predictions of winds in the upper troposphere remained untested. The routine sampling of the upper troposphere by radiosondes that emerged in the mid-20th century confirmed the existence of meridional overturning cells in the atmosphere.
Influence on climate.
The Hadley circulation is one of the most important influences on global climate and planetary habitability, as well as an important transporter of angular momentum, heat and water vapor. Hadley cells flatten the temperature gradient between the equator and the poles, making the extratropics milder. The global precipitation pattern of high precipitation in the tropics and a lack of precipitation at higher latitudes is a consequence of the positioning of the rising and sinking branches of Hadley cells, respectively. Near the equator, the ascent of humid air results in the heaviest precipitation on Earth. The periodic movement of the ITCZ and thus the seasonal variation of the Hadley circulation's rising branches produces the world's monsoons. The descending motion of air associating with the sinking branch produces surface divergence consistent with the prominence of subtropical high-pressure areas. These semipermanent regions of high pressure lie primarily over the ocean between 20° and 40° latitude. Arid conditions are associated with the descending branches of the Hadley circulation, with many of the Earth's deserts and semiarid or arid regions underlying the sinking branches of the Hadley circulation.
The cloudy marine boundary layer common in the subtropics may be seeded by cloud condensation nuclei exported out of the tropics by the Hadley circulation.
Effects of climate change.
Natural variability.
Paleoclimate reconstructions of trade winds and rainfall patterns suggest that the Hadley circulation changed in response to natural climate variability. During Heinrich events within the last 100,000 years, the Northern Hemisphere Hadley cell strengthened while the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell weakened. Variation in insolation during the mid-to-late Holocene resulted in a southward migration of the Northern Hemisphere Hadley cell's ascending and descending branches closer to their present-day positions. Tree rings from the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere suggest that the historical position of the Hadley cell branches have also shifted in response to shorter oscillations, with the Northern Hemisphere descending branch moving southward during positive phases of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and Pacific decadal oscillation and northward during the corresponding negative phases. The Hadley cells were displaced southward between 1400 and 1850, concurrent with drought in parts of the Northern Hemisphere.
Hadley cell expansion and intensity changes.
Observed trends.
According to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), the Hadley circulation has likely expanded since at least the 1980s in response to climate change, with medium confidence in an accompanying intensification of the circulation. An expansion of the overall circulation poleward by about 0.1°–0.5° latitude per decade since the 1980s is largely accounted for by the poleward shift of the Northern Hemisphere Hadley cell, which in atmospheric reanalysis has shown a more marked expansion since 1992. However, the AR6 also reported medium confidence in the expansion of the Northern Hemisphere Hadley cell being within the range of internal variability. In contrast, the AR6 assessed that it was likely that the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell's poleward expansion was due to anthropogenic influence; this finding was based on CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate models.
Studies have produced a large range of estimates for the rate of widening of the tropics due to the use of different metrics; estimates based on upper-tropospheric properties tend to yield a wider range of values. The degree to which the circulation has expanded varies by season, with trends in summer and autumn being larger and statistically significant in both hemispheres. The widening of the Hadley circulation has also resulted in a likely widening of the ITCZ since the 1970s. Reanalyses also suggest that the summer and autumn Hadley cells in both hemispheres have widened and that the global Hadley circulation has intensified since 1979, with a more pronounced intensification in the Northern Hemisphere. Between 1979 and 2010, the power generated by the global Hadley circulation increased by an average of 0.54 TW per year, consistent with an increased input of energy into the circulation by warming SSTs over the tropical oceans. (For comparison, the Hadley circulation's overall power ranges from 0.5 TW to 218 TW throughout the year in the Northern Hemisphere and from 32 to 204 TW in the Southern.) In contrast to reanalyses, CMIP5 climate models depict a weakening of the Hadley circulation since 1979. The magnitude of long-term changes in the circulation strength are thus uncertain due to the influence of large interannual variability and the poor representation of the distribution of latent heat release in reanalyses.
The expansion of the Hadley circulation due to climate change is consistent with the Held–Hou Model, which predicts that the latitudinal extent of the circulation is proportional to the square root of the height of the tropopause. Warming of the troposphere raises the tropopause height, enabling the upper poleward branch of the Hadley cells to extend farther and leading to an expansion of the cells. Results from climate models suggest that the impact of internal variability (such as from the Pacific decadal oscillation) and the anthropogenic influence on the expansion of the Hadley circulation since the 1980s have been comparable. Human influence is most evident in the expansion of the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell; the AR6 assessed medium confidence in associating the expansion of the Hadley circulation in both hemispheres with the added radiative forcing of greenhouse gasses.
Physical mechanisms and projected changes.
The physical processes by which the Hadley circulation expands by human influence are unclear but may be linked to the increased warming of the subtropics relative to other latitudes in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The enhanced subtropical warmth could enable expansion of the circulation poleward by displacing the subtropical jet and baroclinic eddies poleward. Poleward expansion of the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell in the austral summer was attributed by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) to stratospheric ozone depletion based on CMIP5 model simulations, while CMIP6 simulations have not shown as clear of a signal. Ozone depletion could plausibly affect the Hadley circulation through the increase of radiative cooling in the lower stratosphere; this would increase the phase speed of baroclinic eddies and displace them poleward, leading to expansion of Hadley cells. Other eddy-driven mechanisms for expanding Hadley cells have been proposed, involving changes in baroclinicity, wave breaking and other releases of instability. In the extratropics of the Northern Hemisphere, increasing concentrations of black carbon and tropospheric ozone may be a major forcing on that hemisphere's Hadley cell expansion in boreal summer.
Projections from climate models indicate that a continued increase in the concentration of greenhouse gas would result in continued widening of the Hadley circulation. However, simulations using historical data suggest that forcing from greenhouse gasses may account for about 0.1° per decade of expansion of the tropics. Although the widening of the Hadley cells due to climate change has occurred concurrent with an increase in their intensity based on atmospheric reanalyses, climate model projections generally depict a weakening circulation in tandem with a widening circulation by the end of the 21st century. A longer-term increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide may lead to a weakening of the Hadley circulation as a result of the reduction of radiative cooling in the troposphere near the circulation's sinking branches. However, changes in the oceanic circulation within the tropics may attenuate changes in the intensity and width of the Hadley cells by reducing thermal contrasts.
Changes to weather patterns.
The expansion of the Hadley circulation due to climate change is connected to changes in regional and global weather patterns. A widening of the tropics could displace the tropical rain belt, expand subtropical deserts, and exacerbate wildfires and drought. The documented shift and expansion of subtropical ridges are associated with changes in the Hadley circulation, including a westward extension of the subtropical high over the northwestern Pacific, changes in the intensity and position of the Azores High, and the poleward displacement and intensification of the subtropical high pressure belt in the Southern Hemisphere. These changes have influenced regional precipitation amounts and variability, including drying trends over southern Australia, northeastern China and northern South Asia. The AR6 assessed limited evidence that the expansion of the Northern Hemisphere Hadley cell may have led in part to drier conditions in the subtropics and a poleward expansion of aridity during boreal summer. Precipitation changes induced by Hadley circulation changes may lead to changes in regional soil moisture, with modelling showing the most significant declines in the Mediterranean Sea, South Africa and the Southwestern United States. However, the concurrent effects of changing surface temperature patterns over land lead to uncertainties over the influence of Hadley cell broadening on drying over subtropical land areas.
Climate modelling suggests that the shift in the position of the subtropical highs induced by Hadley cell broadening may reduce oceanic upwelling at low latitudes and enhance oceanic upwelling at high latitudes. The expansion of subtropical highs in tandem with the circulation's expansion may also entail a widening of oceanic regions of high salinity and low marine primary production. A decline in extratropical cyclones in the storm track regions in model projections is partly influenced by Hadley cell expansion. Poleward shifts in the Hadley circulation are associated with shifts in the paths of tropical cyclones in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, including a poleward trend in the locations where storms attained their peak intensity.
Extraterrestrial Hadley circulations.
Outside of Earth, any thermally direct circulation that circulates air meridionally across planetary-scale gradients of insolation may be described as a Hadley circulation. A terrestrial atmosphere subject to excess equatorial heating tends to maintain an axisymmetric Hadley circulation with rising motions near the equator and sinking at higher latitudes. Differential heating is hypothesized to result in Hadley circulations analogous to Earth's on other atmospheres in the Solar System, such as on Venus, Mars and Titan. As with Earth's atmosphere, the Hadley circulation would be the dominant meridional circulation for these extraterrestrial atmospheres. Though less understood, Hadley circulations may also be present on the gas giants of the Solar System and should in principle materialize on exoplanetary atmospheres. The spatial extent of a Hadley cell on any atmosphere may be dependent on the rotation rate of the planet or moon, with a faster rotation rate leading to more contracted Hadley cells (with a more restrictive poleward extent) and a more cellular global meridional circulation. The slower rotation rate reduces the Coriolis effect, thus reducing the meridional temperature gradient needed to sustain a jet at the Hadley cell's poleward boundary and thus allowing the Hadley cell to extend farther poleward.
Venus, which rotates slowly, may have Hadley cells that extend farther poleward than Earth's, spanning from the equator to high latitudes in each of the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Its broad Hadley circulation would efficiently maintain the nearly isothermal temperature distribution between the planet's pole and equator and vertical velocities of around . Observations of chemical tracers such as carbon monoxide provide indirect evidence for the existence of the Venusian Hadley circulation. The presence of poleward winds with speeds up to around at an altitude of are typically understood to be associated with the upper branch of a Hadley cell, which may be located above the Venusian surface. The slow vertical velocities associated with the Hadley circulation have not been measured, though they may have contributed to the vertical velocities measured by Vega and Venera missions. The Hadley cells may extend to around 60° latitude, equatorward of a mid-latitude jet stream demarcating the boundary between the hypothesized Hadley cell and the polar vortex. The planet's atmosphere may exhibit two Hadley circulations, with one near the surface and the other at the level of the upper cloud deck. The Venusian Hadley circulation may contribute to the super-rotation of the planet's atmosphere.
Simulations of the Martian atmosphere suggest that a Hadley circulation is also present in Mars' atmosphere, exhibiting a stronger seasonality compared to Earth's Hadley circulation. This greater seasonality results from diminished thermal inertia resulting from the lack of an ocean and the planet's thinner atmosphere. Additionally, Mars' orbital eccentricity leads to a stronger and wider Hadley cell during its northern winter compared to its southern winter. During most of the Martian year, when a single Hadley cell prevails, its rising and sinking branches are located at 30° and 60° latitude, respectively, in global climate modelling. The tops of the Hadley cells on Mars may reach higher (to around altitude) and be less defined compared to on Earth due to the lack of a strong tropopause on Mars. While latent heating from phase changes associated with water drive much of the ascending motion in Earth's Hadley circulation, ascent in Mars' Hadley circulation may be driven by radiative heating of lofted dust and intensified by the condensation of carbon dioxide near the polar ice cap of Mars' wintertime hemisphere, steepening pressure gradients. Over the course of the Martian year, the mass flux of the Hadley circulation ranges between 109 kg s−1 during the equinoxes and 1010 at the solstices.
A Hadley circulation may also be present in the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan. Like Venus, the slow rotation rate of Titan may support a spatially broad Hadley circulation. General circulation modeling of Titan's atmosphere suggests the presence of a cross-equatorial Hadley cell. This configuration is consistent with the meridional winds observed by the Huygens spacecraft when it landed near Titan's equator. During Titan's solstices, its Hadley circulation may take the form of a single Hadley cell that extends from pole to pole, with warm gas rising in the summer hemisphere and sinking in the winter hemisphere. A two-celled configuration with ascent near the equator is present in modelling during a limited transitional period near the equinoxes. The distribution of convective methane clouds on Titan and observations from Huygens spacecraft suggest that the rising branch of its Hadley circulation occurs in the mid-latitudes of its summer hemisphere. Frequent cloud formation occurs at 40° latitude in Titan's summer hemisphere from ascent analogous to Earth's ITCZ.

Pennsylvania Route 412

Pennsylvania Route 412 (PA 412) is a north–south state route located in Bucks and Northampton counties in southeastern Pennsylvania. Its southern terminus is at PA 611 in the Nockamixon Township community of Harrow. Its northern terminus is at PA 378 in Bethlehem.
The route passes through rural areas in northern Bucks County, forming a concurrency with PA 212 in the Springtown area. From there, PA 412 continues into Northampton County and passes through Hellertown before coming to an interchange with Interstate 78 (I-78) and heading into Bethlehem. In Bethlehem, PA 412 passes the former Bethlehem Steel site and runs through the South Side neighborhood.
PA 412 was originally part of the 18th-century Durham Road that ran through Bucks County and north into the Lehigh Valley. The route was first designated by 1927 between PA 212 in Springtown and PA 12 in Bethlehem. PA 412 was extended south to U.S. Route 611 (US 611) in Harrow by 1930. The route was realigned through the South Side of Bethlehem in the 1980s.
Route description.
 PA 412 begins at an intersection with PA 611 in the community of Harrow in Nockamixon Township, Bucks County, heading northwest on two-lane undivided Durham Road. The road passes through farmland with some homes and businesses, coming to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 563. The route continues through a mix of farmland and woodland with some development, passing through Bucksville and heading to the southwest of Palisades High School. PA 412 enters Springfield Township and becomes an unnamed road, passing through Gallows Hill. The road winds northwest through more rural areas and comes to an intersection with PA 212. At this point, PA 412 turns west to join PA 212 in a concurrency, heading through forests and fields and crossing Cooks Creek before passing through the residential community of Springtown as Main Street. The road curves southwest and heads back into rural areas as an unnamed road. PA 412 splits from PA 212 by turning west onto Hellertown Road, passing through farmland and woodland.
The route enters Lower Saucon Township in Northampton County, which is in the Lehigh Valley, becoming Leithsville Road and running through more rural areas. The road turns north at the community of Leithsville and passes through woodland with homes and commercial establishments. PA 412 enters the borough of Hellertown and becomes Main Street, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane that runs past businesses. The route becomes two lanes again and becomes lined with homes with a few businesses as it continues north through Hellertown. The road becomes the border between Hellertown to the west and the city of Bethlehem to the east as it comes to an interchange with I-78. A park and ride lot is located west of the road at this interchange.
Past this interchange, PA 412 fully enters Bethlehem and becomes Hellertown Road, passing through commercial areas. The route gains a second northbound lane and crosses over the Saucon Creek and under a Lehigh Valley Rail Management railroad line before turning northwest onto East 4th Street at the Shimersville Road intersection, where there is a northbound jughandle. The road passes between an industrial park at the former Bethlehem Steel plant to the north and a railroad yard to the south, curving west and becoming a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. PA 412 passes over the Lehigh Valley Rail Management line before turning northwest onto four-lane divided Daly Avenue. The route passes between the Wind Creek Bethlehem casino resort to the north and residential neighborhoods to the south, curving west. The road intersects the south end of the Minsi Trail Bridge, which carries Stefko Boulevard across the Lehigh River. PA 412 runs to the south of more of the former Bethlehem Steel site, turning west onto undivided East 3rd Street, with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane. The route passes through commercial areas, narrowing to two lanes and heading through the downtown area of the South Side neighborhood of Bethlehem. PA 412 intersects an access road to the Hill to Hill Bridge, which carries PA 378 over the Lehigh River to the north, at which point PA 412 turns south onto Brodhead Avenue. A short distance later, the route turns southwest onto Broadway and passes through urban areas of homes and businesses. PA 412 reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 378 known as Five Points.
History.
The predecessor to PA 412 was the Durham Road, an 18th-century road that linked Bristol with upper Bucks County, where it split into branches serving various communities such as Bethlehem and Easton. When Pennsylvania first legislated its state routes in 1911, what is now PA 412 was not designated as part of a route. PA 412 was first designated by 1927 to run from PA 212 near Springtown north to PA 12 (now PA 378) in Bethlehem. At this time, the entire route was paved except for the southernmost portion. By 1930, PA 412 was extended south to it current terminus at US 611 (now PA 611) in Harrow. By this time, the entire route was paved. PA 412 was realigned in Bethlehem to use Daly Avenue, 3rd Street, Brodhead Avenue and Broadway instead of 4th Street to reach PA 378 in the 1980s. In March 2012, a project began to widen PA 412 between Cherry Lane in Hellertown and Daly Avenue in Bethlehem. This project expanded the road to two southbound lanes and three northbound lanes between I-78 and Shimersville Road and improved the interchange with I-78. The project was finished in 2016.

Olive oropendola

The olive oropendola (Psarocolius bifasciatus) is the largest member of the icterid family and rivals the Amazonian umbrellabird as the largest passerine bird in South America. It is sometimes placed in the genus "Gymnostinops" instead of "Psarocolius". It is found widely – but often in low densities – throughout humid lowland forests of the Amazon Basin, with the notable exception of most of the Guiana Shield. It is sometimes split into two species, the western olive oropendola ("P. yuracares") and the eastern Pará oropendola ("P. bifasciatus"), but the subspecies "P. y. neivae" is widely recognized as a hybrid swarm, and the vast majority of authorities consider them a single species.
Description.
The sexes of this icterid are very different in size: the male is 52 cm (21 in) long and weighs 550 g (1.2 lbs); the smaller female is 41 cm (16 in) long and weighs 260 g (9.2 oz). Confusingly, the name "olive oropendola" is usually used for this combined species, despite the fact that the nominate subspecies has no olive to its plumage, as its head and chest are black (these are olive in "P. b. yuracares"). The back, wings and belly of this large oropendola are brown, the outer rectrices are yellow (i.e. tail appears all yellow from below), the bare facial skin is pink, the eyes are brown, and the bill is black with an orange tip. The superficially similar green oropendola has an olive back and wing-coverts, lacks extensive bare facial-skin, has a pale bill with an orange tip, and blue eyes.
Behavior.
The olive oropendola is a canopy bird that most often is seen flying high over the tops of the trees. Compared to other oropendolas it is a "loner" most frequently seen alone or in pairs, and drawing less attention to itself than its cousins, despite the greater size. Small groups are seen occasionally, and may even mix with other oropendolas. The breeding colonies are small, usually with fewer than five birds. The nest is a hanging woven ball fibers and vines, 60–180 cm long, high in a tree. Relatively little is known about these bird's breeding habits.
The omnivorous diet appears to be fairly catholic. They may eat small vertebrates (especially amphibians and reptiles), large insects, nectar, and fruit. They often travel great distances through the forests, except when lingering around their nesting colony.
The song of the olive oropendola is a liquid, gurgling and "expanding" ', given as a displaying male falls forward on a perch and rustles his wings over the back. Nasal ' and "" calls are given while in flight or when foraging.

Conspiracy (Junior M.A.F.I.A. album)

Conspiracy is the debut studio album by American hip-hop group Junior M.A.F.I.A. It was released on August 29, 1995, through Big Beat Records with distribution via Atlantic Records.
The recording sessions took place at Sound on Sound Studios, Unique Recording Studios and Quad Recording Studios in New York City. The album was produced by DJ Clark Kent, Akshun, Daddy-O, Ez Elpee, Special Ed, Understanding, Lance "Un" Rivera, and the Notorious B.I.G., with the latter two also served as executive producers with Craig Kallman. It features a lone guest appearance from Jimmy Cozier.
In the United States, the album debuted at number 8 on the "Billboard" 200 and peaked at number 2 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts, selling 69,000 copies in its first week. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on December 6, 1995 for the sales of 500,000 units in the US alone.
The album was supported by three singles with accompanying music videos: "Player's Anthem", "I Need You Tonight" and "Get Money".
Critical reception.
"Conspiracy" was met with above average reviews from music critics. Nicholas Poluhoff of "The Source" called it "a solid debut LP, but there are some unoriginal moments that drag it down". Cheo Hodari Coker of "Los Angeles Times" wrote that "overall "The Conspiracy" is like watching a kung-fu flick on video: you often have to fast-forward to the best fight scenes to remind you why you wanted to watch it in the first place." Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote, "Considering "Ready to Die" was one of the seminal hip-hop releases of the early '90s, "Conspiracy" could have been an inspired, enjoyable sequel; instead, it's a fitfully successful replication of the earlier record's strengths."

Morris–Butler House

The Morris–Butler House is a Second Empire-style house built about 1864 in the Old Northside Historic District of Indianapolis, Indiana. Restored as a museum home by Indiana Landmarks between 1964 and 1969, the American Civil War-era residence was the non-profit organization's first preservation project. Restoration work retained some of its original architectural features, and the home was furnished in Victorian and Post-Victorian styles. Its use was changed to a venue for Indiana Landmarks programs, special events, and private rentals following a refurbishment in 2013. Regular daily tours of the property have been discontinued.
History.
Private residence.
The house was built about 1864 for John D. Morris, an Indianapolis businessman, who was the son of Morris Morris, an Indianapolis settler. It is believed that the home was designed by noted Indianapolis architect Diedrich A. Bohlen. The house is located in what was then a suburb of Indianapolis, an area now known as the Old Northside Historic District. Morris lived in the house with his family until the 1870s, when the family experienced financial difficulties. In 1878 he sold the house to Noble Chase Butler, a bankruptcy lawyer and clerk of the United States District Court in Indianapolis. Butler lived in the house with his wife and seven children until his death in 1933. Butler's daughter, Florence, lived in the house until her death on January 7, 1957. By that time the neighborhood was quite different. Most of the homes were low-income rentals and many suffered from neglect. The house was briefly used as an artists' studio, gallery, and apartments between 1957 and 1964.
Historic house museum.
With funds from Eli Lilly, Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana (now Indiana Landmarks) bought the house in 1963, when it was in danger of being destroyed by the construction of Interstate 70. Lilly had once lived on North Delaware Street, about a block away from the Morris–Butler House, with his first wife, Evelyn Fortune Lilly, in the 1920s. He also had known Florence Butler. Lilly provided $22,500 to purchase the house and additional funds for restoration. The home, named after the two families who once resided there, was Historic Landmarks Foundation's first historic preservation project.
Architect H. Roll McLaughlin, A.I.A., of James Associates and a president of Indiana Landmarks, headed the restoration. Work included repairing warped floors, cleaning and repainting the darkened brickwork, and adding a new slate roof. The house was opened to the public as a historic home and decorative arts museum in May 1969. Its interiors were furnished and decorated in Victorian-era furnishings, along with a few reproductions. Notable furnishing included a Wooton desk, paintings by Hoosier artist Jacob Cox, and Charles Eastlake chairs. Indiana Landmarks staffed the house with tour guides, coordinated further restoration, and hosted educational and cultural events. Morris–Butler House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.
Refurbished as event space.
Refurbishments to the house made during 2012 and 2013 included general repairs, painting, improvements to its landscape, and interior updates. Its use was changed from a house museum to a venue for Indiana Landmarks programs, special events, and event rentals. Daily tours of the property have been discontinued.
Description.
The Second Empire-style home, with overall dimensions are by , is located the corner of North Park Avenue and East 12th Street, north of downtown Indianapolis, adjacent to the Indiana Landmark Center and a part of its campus complex. The exterior features a French mansard roof of gray slate, a white limestone foundation, red brick walls, a four-story tower, and a limestone arch at the main entrance. The home has two main stories in addition to a cellar, an attic, and the brick tower. It also contains wooden front and side porches, dormers, and cornices. The dwelling's central hall floor plan has a service ell at the rear. A roofed breezeway connects the service ell to a red-brick summer kitchen. The house's projecting window on its south façade and its front porch are surmounted by iron railings. The property also contains a carriage house with living quarters. A black mental fence installed around the perimeter of the landscaped lot is a reproduction.

The Visitor (1979 film)

The Visitor () is a 1979 science fiction horror film directed by Giulio Paradisi (credited as Michael J. Paradise) and based on a story by Egyptian-born Italian writer and producer Ovidio G. Assonitis. It features a cast of well-established stars including John Huston, Shelley Winters, Mel Ferrer, Glenn Ford, Lance Henriksen, and Sam Peckinpah with supporting appearances by Neal Boortz and Steve Somers. It was filmed on location in Atlanta, Georgia and at Cinecittà Studios in Rome. It has garnered a cult following over the years.
Plot.
In an enigmatic, alien landscape, Jerzy Colsowicz experiences a vision of a powerful and destructive storm brought about by a young human girl. His colleague, an enigmatic Christ-like figure, tells his bald pupils about the centuries-long cosmic conflict between Zatteen, an evil inter-spatial force of immense magnitude with powerful psychic abilities, and his benevolent arch-rival Yahweh. Zatteen escaped to the planet Earth centuries ago, and though he was eventually tracked down and killed by Yahweh, his spirit lives on in the minds of mankind, waiting for an opportunity to reemerge and wreak havoc. The figure tells his disciples that Zatteen had produced dozens of children with human women before his death, and these descendants continue to populate the Earth.
During a professional basketball game at The Omni in Atlanta, home team owner Raymond Armstead sits courtside and promises an interviewer that the team will win at all costs. Since Raymond is a new owner and the source of his wealth is unknown, the interviewer presses him on the source of his wealth. He eventually answers that the money comes "from God". Raymond is in league with a secret group of Satanists who wish to bring about the resurgence of Zatteen. His associate Dr. Walker reminds him that his girlfriend Barbara Collins can be used as a conduit to distill Zatteen's powers into a corporeal, human form. Her 8-year old daughter Katy has already displayed psychokinetic abilities, and it's the Satanists' goal to have Raymond father a male child with Barbara, who in turn will mate with his half-sister and produce the physical embodiment of Zatteen.
Katy is only partially aware of her powers, and she experiments with them throughout the film, most notably helping Raymond's basketball team to victory. Colsowicz, who possesses powers similar to Katy, is sent to Earth by the Christ-like figure with several of his disciples, where at first they survey her from a distance. He's also acquainted with Barbara's new maid, Jane Phillips, who instantly sees the potential evil inherent in Katy, as she had once had a child with the same abilities. Katy begins using her powers to facilitate the Satanists' goals, causing a series of fatal accidents to happen to their enemies. Barbara is inadvertently paralyzed by a gunshot wound, and becomes relegated to a wheelchair. A police detective, Jake Durham, investigating the deaths is killed in a car accident facilitated by the Satanists.
Raymond fails to seduce Barbara, and the Satanists decide to proceed with other, more violent methods. Barbara does get pregnant after the intervention, but is still afraid of having another child and has her ex, Katy's biological father, Dr. Sam Collins, abort the baby. When she returns home, she is attacked for her actions by Raymond and Katy, who attempt to execute her by tying a wire around her neck and sending her down the stairs in her chair lift. Before they can succeed, Colsowicz intervenes and summons an army of doves that thwart Katy and kill Raymond. The next day, the other Satanists are found dead at their round table, presumably by Colsowicz's intervention.
Colsowicz returns to the Christ-like figure and his apostles. He reveals that he has brought Katy with him. She is now bald and cleansed of her malice, and the film ends with her smiling and embracing Colsowicz, who insists that children are not to be harmed.
Cast.
Atlanta radio personality Neal Boortz has a small role as a businessman, while fellow radio host Steve Somers has a minor walk-on role. Actor Franco Nero has an un-credited supporting role as an unnamed Christ analogue.
Release.
Reissue.
"The Visitor" was released on DVD by independent distributor Code Red in November 2010. It was the first time the film had been presented in its uncut form in the United States.
In 2013, independent distributor Drafthouse Films acquired the film. Drafthouse Films announced they would re-release the film in remastered form on October 31, 2013 with a VOD/digital and home entertainment release in January 2014.
The film's soundtrack was released in 1978 in Italy and 1979 worldwide.
Critical reception.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, "The Visitor" holds an approval rating of 78%, based on 18 reviews, and an average rating of 6.4/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating "generally positive reviews".
"Film.com"'s David Ehrlich referred to the film as "a remake of "The Bad Seed" as filtered through the acid-tinged mind of Alejandro Jodorowsky." Many of the set pieces in the film bear striking resemblances to contemporary releases. When the Visitor returns to his cosmic home, there is an extended light sequence that is modeled on the end of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". Katy's ominous powers are rendered in the style of "The Omen", and the conflict over her nature, with good winning out over evil due to the help of an elderly man, led critic Sean Axmaker to call the film an ""Exorcist" knock-off". The review cited other obvious influences on the film like "Carrie", "The Birds", and "The Lady from Shanghai".
Miscellany.
The film was released in Italy under the title "Stridulum" and in Spain as "El visitante del más allá".
On 25 October 2019, film-mocking website RiffTrax released a downloadable digital version of "The Visitor" with a comedic commentary of the film. They said, ""The Visitor"s got ambitious cinematography, big name actors, and a score that makes "Goblin" sound like they barfed on their Casio. But when you add them all together, the result is a baffling mess, as incoherent as it is unintentionally funny."

Michigan's 4th congressional district

Michigan's 4th congressional district is a United States congressional district located in the state of Michigan. The current 4th district contains much of Michigan's old 2nd district, and includes all of Allegan and Van Buren counties, as well as portions of Ottawa, Kalamazoo, Calhoun, and Berrien counties. In 2022, the district was redrawn to start in St. Joseph Township and extend north to Port Sheldon Township. The 4th is currently represented by Republican Bill Huizenga, who previously represented the old 2nd district.
Composition.
For the 118th and successive Congresses (based on redistricting following the 2020 census), the district contains all or portions of the following counties and municipalities:
Allegan County (35)
Berrien County (12)
Calhoun County (5)
Kalamazoo County (18)
Ottawa County (11)
Van Buren County (29)
History.
Michigan's 4th congressional district was first formed in 1852. At this time It covered everywhere from Macomb County to the western end of the Upper Peninsula. Ingham County was not in the district, and then the boundary turned northward after Eaton County only going west again Midland County was reached. It went west again along Midland and subsequent counties southern lines and then headed north again on the east side of Muskegon County, with Manistee being its southern county that bordered Lake Michigan.
In 1863 it gained the areas around Grand Rapids and Muskegon but lost everything east of Ionia County and most of the Upper Peninsula. In 1872 it was redrawn to cover Berrien, Cass, Kalamazoo, Van Buren and St. Joseph Counties. In 1892 these boundaries were altered by the addition of Allegan and Barry Counties but the subtraction of Kalamazoo County. This remained the district boundaries for the next 72 years.
In 1964 the 4th district was redrawn. Barry County was subtracted from the district while Branch and Hillsdale Counties were added. In 1972 the district boundaries were altered by adding small sections of Calhoun County and subtracting small portions of Hillsdale and St. Joseph Counties.
The 1982 redistricting removed from the district all of Hillsdale County and the portion of Calhoun County that was in the district. Quincy and Butler Townships in Branch County were also removed. In Kalamazoo County Schoolcraft Township and most of Portage were added to the district. The southern and western portions of Allegan County and most of western Ottawa County including Holland, Michigan were also in the district.
In the renumbering of 1992 this district essentially became the 6th, while the old 10th became the new 4th.
The old 10th and 1990s 4th.
The old 10th included most of Grand Traverse and all of Kalkaska County which were lost to the new 1st (old 11th) in the 1992 redistricting. It also included Wexford County that was moved to the new 2nd (old 9th) in the 1992 redistricting. The only other areas lost were small parts of Antrim and Iosco Counties and a portion of Shiawasee County consisting of Durand and Vernon Township.
The new 4th gained Montcalm county from the old 9th district. It gained the Clinton and most of the Shiawasee portions of the old 6th district and the northern half of Oscoda County. It also gained a portion of south-west Saginaw County and the portion of Midland County that had not been in the old 10th.
In 2002 Leelaunau County and a small section of north-west Grand Traverse County were the only areas gerrymandered from the 1st and other districts into the 4th that had not been in the old 10th.

Overlord (2007 video game)

Overlord is an action role-playing video game developed by Triumph Studios and published by Codemasters for Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, Linux and PlayStation 3. It was released in 2007 in North America on 26 June, in Europe on 29 June and Australia on 6 July.
Development on the game began in early 2006 and the game was announced in May of the same year, with gameplay demonstrated at E3 2006. After over a year and a half of development, its release in 2007 was met with generally favourable reviews, and helped boost overall sales for Codemasters that year. An expansion pack entitled ' was released in late 2007 (Germany only) and February 2008 (worldwide), along with additional multiplayer maps and a local split-screen co-op mode. Raising Hell was also released for the PlayStation 3 in June 2008, bundled with the original game. A sequel, "Overlord II", was released in June 2009, followed by a spinoff for the Wii, entitled ', and a Nintendo DS game called "".
"Overlord" is set in a fantasy world, where the player takes the role of a resurrected warrior known as "The Overlord" Half Man Half Monster who has control over hordes of gremlin-like creatures known as "Minions". The player must defeat seven corrupt ruling heroes in order to reconquer the lands and establish his lordship over its inhabitants. The game features a corruption feature, similar to that of the "Fable" games, but allowing the player to "be evil… or "really" evil", where certain actions and choices affect different aspects of the story and gameplay. While the Overlord is controlled in a third person perspective, the way minions are controlled brings elements of real-time strategy and upgrades bring those of role-playing games. The game uses dark humour, and is a satirical parody of the traditional fantasy setting and plot. The story was written by Rhianna Pratchett.
Gameplay.
The game centers on simultaneously controlling the Overlord and an army of goblin-like minions to traverse the 3D gameworld and defeat the seven heroes who slew the Overlord's predecessor, and who have since been corrupted by power. Each one represents one of the seven deadly sins.
There are four minion races, each of which have their own colour and abilities. Browns are melee fighters, blues can revive defeated minions and swim, reds throw fireballs at enemies, can put out fires and are immune to fire attacks, and greens backstab enemies and can clear poisonous gas and plants. Minions are summoned from the spawning pits found scattered throughout the game. The player needs to pay life-force, which can be gained by killing creatures, like large bugs, to summon minions. At the start of the game only five minions can be summoned at once; as the game progresses this can increase to a maximum of fifty. In addition to controlling minions, the player can sacrifice them at altars of blood and magic to restore the Overlord's health or mana. Once a forge is acquired, they can be used to imbue weapons and armour to increase the Overlord's abilities.
The player begins in an old ruined tower that has been plundered of its magical artefacts and acts as a central hub for the player. As the stolen tower objects are recovered, new rooms and spells become available for use, and the Overlord's maximum health and mana increase. The player also needs to recover the blue, green, and red minion hives to summon the respective minions. The player can customise the tower with a variety of visual items such as banners and statues; the available visual items differ depending on in-game actions. Armour and weapons can be purchased or improved in the forge. Most defeated enemy types appear as opponents in the dungeon, an arena where the Overlord can fight them again (excluding bosses such as heroes and one-of-a-kind beasts).
While the game claims that the Overlord is evil, the quests show him being more of an anti-hero Half Man Half Monster . It tracks how corrupt the Overlord is in accomplishing his goals. During the game the Overlord is tempted by each of the deadly sins while trying to kill their corresponding heroes. The player's choices will influence your corruption level, either raising or lowering it. Slaughtering inoffensive townsfolk, stealing gold and other activities can increase the corruption level. The corruption level changes the way townsfolk treat the Overlord and will also change his appearance, a system similar to "Fable". As corruption increases, the Overlord's armour will become more devilish with horns protruding out of the back, shoulders, elbows and knees and he will acquire a black aura. The corruption level determines which game ending the player sees and which high-level spells they can cast.
The game offers several multiplayer modes, Slaughter, Survival, and Pillage. Slaughter pits two Overlords against each other in a head-to-head combat with potentially hundreds of minions. In Survival, two Overlords team up against large armies of enemies. Pillage is a competition in which two Overlords and their minions compete to see who can pillage and plunder the most gold in a selected amount of time. The Xbox 360 version provides voice chat over Xbox Live. In the PlayStation 3 version of "Raising Hell", the game features a mini-map on screen to help the player navigate through the game's world.
Synopsis.
Characters.
The player takes the role of the Overlord, the game's silent protagonist/anti-hero, whose motivations and personality are left for the player to determine. At the outset of the game, tiny gremlin-like minions pry open his coffin and revive him. In rapid succession, his minions shove him into armour, name him successor to the previous Overlord, and task him with slaying his predecessor's murderers, the Seven Heroes. In the intervening years, the Seven Heroes each fell prey to one of the Seven Deadly Sins. Despite recalling nothing of his past, the Overlord begins to rebuild the tower at the suggestion of his adviser Gnarl. As the new Overlord, the protagonist holds absolute sway over his minions. Complementing this power, he possesses some proficiency using axes, swords, and maces. Through his tower, the Overlord can channel magical energies capable of wanton destruction or defence.
Although the titular Overlord is the protagonist, the game relies heavily on Gnarl, the oldest minion, to advise and guide the player. For the majority of the game, he remains by the Tower Heart relaying information and reminders since "there are evil deeds that need doing". He acts as narrator for the plot. Eventually, the Overlord's mistress comes to reside in the tower. She redecorates the rooms and upgrades the minions and the tower as well as shares opinions on certain actions. Rose is the first potential mistress rescued from bandits. Despite the Overlord's menace and actions, she is initially strong-willed, cheery and unafraid of the Overlord's minions. The other potential mistress is Rose's sister Velvet whose evil tendencies are less ambiguous than her sister's and dresses far more provocatively. She repeatedly ask for presents and lusts for the Overlord and shows a distinct lack of empathy or grief over her fiancé's murder at the hands of the Overlord.
The "seven heroes" are corrupt themselves, each with a trait representing one of the seven deadly sins. The Halfling leader Melvin Underbelly has become gluttonous and as a result, morbidly obese – he has taken to sending bands of armed also obese halflings to steal food from neighbouring Spree to feed his unending hunger. The mightiest Elven warrior of Evernight Forest, Oberon Greenhaze is in a constant sleep and his sloth has caused his nightmares to haunt the forest. His apathy allowed the dwarves to invade Evernight and kill or enslave most of the elves, but they were in turn driven out when the creatures of his nightmares became real. The ruler of Heaven's Peak and Velvet's fiancé, Sir William the Black shows strong lust towards unorthodox sexual interests such as having relations with a succubus, and indulges in decadent parties with a secret cult. The presence of the succubus has caused a plague of undeath in the fortified city. The Dwarf King Goldo Golderson of the Golden Hills has become overly greedy and desires wealth over all the other aspects of life where he has even forced the remaining elves to mine for it. His paranoia that his riches will be stolen has led him to heavily militarise the entire dwarven empire – he himself rides a war-like steam roller named "Rollie". Envy drives Jewel the Thieving Hero to steal anything valuable even though she cares nothing for possessions, and Kahn the Warrior is very protective of her and is driven wild with wrath whenever anything appears to threaten her. Both of them command the bandits and beholders from the Ruborian Desert. The Previous Overlord, having possessed the body of the Wizard (who was the founder of the group of heroes), shows pride in his work, which involves deception and an urge for supreme power, and is the game's main antagonist.
Plot.
The game begins where Gnarl and the Brown minions awaken the Overlord from his tomb. From here they suit him in his armour and proclaim him Overlord in his old and dilapidated tower – the previous Overlord having been killed by heroes, ready to reconquer the lands. The Overlord first turns to the Mellow Hills, where the Halflings and their leader Melvin Underbelly are using the townspeople of Spree and Red minions as slave labour. The Overlord storms the Halfling Homes, slaying Melvin and reclaiming the Reds and Spree (to the peasants’ delight or disgust depending on whether the Overlord returns their stolen food). Castle Spree however has come under attack by bandits. After flushing them out, the castle mistress Rose offers her service to the Overlord.
At Evernight Forest, the roots of a tree where Oberon Greenhaze sleeps cover the Elves' home, nearly extinct after being ransacked by Dwarves. The Green minions are found and Oberon is slain. The Elves' sacred statue, however, has been stolen by the Dwarves, angering Jewel, the Thieving Hero, who wanted to steal it for herself. At Heaven's Peak the town is overrun by zombies and demons. Here the Overlord gains the Blue minions. At the town's inn, it is discovered that town leader Sir William the Black had fallen for a Succubus, calling off his wedding to Rose's sister Velvet. Killing Sir William in Angelis Keep, Velvet offers her services to the Overlord and he must choose between her and Rose.
The Overlord turns to the Dwarven Golden Hills and their leader Goldo Golderson, who has become greedy for gold. Here the remaining enslaved Elves claim the last of their women are being held in the Royal Halls of the Dwarven Keep. Meanwhile, at the Dwarf construction site, Gnarl recommends that the Overlord stash a few minions inside the Elf sacred statue and allow Jewel to take it in order to follow her to her homeland, the Ruborian Desert. Back at the Royal Halls, where Goldo is defeated, the Overlord can either take his stash of gold or free the remaining Elf women before the halls collapse. The Ruborian desert is found and Jewel is captured and interrogated. An enraged Kahn the Warrior, protective of Jewel, strikes back and the Overlord now has to save Spree and Heaven's Peak from his wrath.
Back at the tower the minions submit to the previous Overlord who has secretly possessed the Wizard, originally father to Rose and Velvet, and who lays claim to his previous title. The old Overlord tells the current one that he was originally the eighth hero who came to slay him, yet fell from a great height and was left for dead by his companions while they looted the Tower. The Old Overlord put him in the sarcophagus to heal his wounds in order to use him to defeat the other heroes. The Overlord battles the old Overlord, during which the old Overlord brags of being responsible for the corruption of the heroes. Upon the old Overlord's death, the Overlord reclaims his tower and minions. Depending on the Overlord's corruption and choices throughout, the ending will show 4 of 8 different ending cutscenes where either the Overlord is met with bliss and praise or he pillages and scorches the land and tortures the inhabitants. Regardless of the player's unique ending, the Jester is shown performing some sort of , with Gnarl narrating "Evil will always find a way".
Development.
"Overlord" was announced in May 2006 for the Xbox 360 and PC, advertised as being a next generation game set in a "twisted fantasy world where players have the choice to be evil ... or really evil!" Along with this announcement, the first screenshots and artwork were released. Early concept art showed the Overlord with a clearly visible human face as opposed to his form in the final release as a dark covered shadow with lit up eyes. At E3 2006, the majority of the game mechanics were revealed within the same month, while the multiplayer component had yet to be announced.
The Xbox 360 demo was released for download over Xbox Live on 8 June, while the PC demo was released just days later over the internet, weeks before the game's first release in North America. The demo included only the initial portion of the game, which contained the game's introductory cinematic and narration, the tutorial and the Overlord's battle to free human peasants from a Halfling operated slave camp. The full game was released simultaneously for Windows and Xbox 360 in 2007 in North America on 26 June, Europe on 29 June, and Australia on 6 July.
During post release, along with patches, by August there were already outlined plans for downloadable content for both versions. These were said to include the introduction of new multiplayer maps, offline co-op and the possibility of an extension or an additional chapter to the game's single-player plot. A patch was released for the PC version of the game, updating the software to version 1.2 and fixing a number of bugs, including one which occasionally prevented players from completing the game. The corresponding Xbox 360 update arrived several weeks later. The first downloadable content was announced in November the same year, along with news of an expansion, in the form of a "Challenge Pack", which was to add seven new maps and two modes to the multiplayer feature, an offline split screen version and a "Legendary" difficulty for single player, with corresponding Achievement Points for the 360 version. These new modes were made available in late 2007 in Germany only, and on 15 February 2008 worldwide, for the PC and Xbox Live for the 360, along with the split-screen option for free.
In July 2007, shortly after the release of "Overlord" there were rumours of a PlayStation 3 port, due to job advertisements at Triumph Studios, which mentioned one position needed "Porting [Xbox 360]/PC code base to [PlayStation 3]". A spokesman for Codemasters however quickly corrected this by stating "We are not porting "Overlord" to [PlayStation 3]." In February 2008 Codemasters confirmed a PlayStation 3 version of "Overlord" was in development. Instead of a straight port of the original, the version includes both the original game and its additional downloadable content and expansion on one Blu-ray Disc, under the title "Overlord: Raising Hell", released in Q2 2008. The demo was made available on the PlayStation Store on 15 May 2008 and later fully released in Europe on 20 June, North America on 24 June, and in Australia on 26 June. Developed by Virtual Programming, ports for "Overlord" and the "Raising Hell" expansion were released for Linux and OS X on 21 July 2016.
"Overlord: Raising Hell".
On 1 November 2007, Codemasters announced "Overlord: Raising Hell", a downloadable expansion pack. The premise behind this is that an Abyss appears in each of the five kingdoms (Mellow Hills, Evernight Forest, Heaven's Peak, the Golden Hills and the Ruborian Desert), causing the residents to disappear. In each of the Abysses there is a hero being tortured and an Abyss Stone. In order to obtain the Abyss Stone and gain control over the Abyss, the Overlord has to battle Wraiths, the residents of the Abysses, and the fallen heroes. Once the Overlord has control of the Abysses, he will be able to battle the one who summoned these Abysses and fight for the domination of his realm. Along with the additional multiplayer content, "Raising Hell" was released for the PC and Xbox Live for the Xbox 360, in late 2007 in Germany only, and worldwide on 15 February 2008.
Reception.
Before its release, at E3 2006, "Overlord" won GameSpot's E3 2006 Editors Choice Award of Best Surprise. "Overlord" gained a generally positive response from game critics with an average review score of 77% for the Xbox 360 version and 81% for the PC at GameRankings. Many praised the game for its concept, noted for being similar to that of "Pikmin", which was popular for the same reason.
GameSpot noted "the satisfaction of running amok with your legion of wickedly enthusiastic minions is what makes "Overlord" worth playing", while "Game Informer" praised the game's personality, notably that of the minions, where "The satire is funny, and the evil is deliciously over-the-top, but the minions are the real stars". IGN stated similar pros, calling it "evil, yet light-hearted, humor" and that with the "richly detailed world combine for a game that is worth diving into". 1UP.com noted the personal element of controlling the minions, stating "If they (minions) die, just call up more. Something happens along the way, though: You start getting attached to the little guys".
Despite the game's premise as the choice to be "evil or really evil", numerous reviewers pointed out that some of the game's choices within missions are more good than evil; such as, for example, the option to return the peasants' stolen food stocks. While mentioning this too, Eurogamer added that, since the game humour is mainly satire, these good deeds "kind of becomes the joke. Especially early on, there's a fairly obvious irony in that everyone else in the world is assuming that you're this brave hero when in fact you're clearly a sociopath". In December 2007, "Overlord" was included in "Eurogamer"s Top 50 Games of 2007.
Other reviewers noted that the game can become frustrating at times, due to the controls not being able to keep up with the game's pace, and apparent glitches between platform and regional versions. IGN US gave the 360 version a 6.6/10 due to a game crashing bug, calling it "the equivalent of having to critique a good book only to pause three quarters of the way through and have the author rip the remaining pages out simply because you took a break at the wrong moment". IGN UK and Australia, however, did not find such a bug, giving "Overlord" a higher score of 8.1 and 8.0. "GameSpot" had a similar issue over the poor camera control in the PC version, at first rating it with a 6.0, but re-rated the game higher after reviewing a newer version. They still, however, held the shortcoming of the "controls that you'll occasionally struggle against". GameSpy noted the multiplayer mode being "sloppy" and "unstable" at times, not being as enjoyable as the single player mode, having "experienced a couple disconnects, and had more than one game end prematurely due to simple frustration".
Sequel and spin-offs.
Following the 2007 game's release on the PlayStation 3 in 2008 as "Raising Hell", the same year on 13 August Codemasters announced a sequel entitled "Overlord II" to be released for all three platforms to be released sometime in 2009. According to developers, the game "massively increases the scope of the original concept" while taking the role of a different Overlord due to the events in the story of "Raising Hell", continuing where the last game finished with a new "Roman-inspired" prime foe. Control over minions will also be expanded allowing to do other tasks like "riding mounts, using war machines and sailing warships"
In the same announcement for the official sequel were plans for a spin-off for the Wii entitled "" to feature a new Overlord although plot continuity with the main series has yet to be explained but is to establish "the idea that there have been a series of Overlords throughout time". Being developed for the Wii, it has motion controls implemented such as "plucking a minion from the horde, holding him by the neck and shaking him around" by using this feature. "Dark Legend" is a prequel set prior to the original game in the storyline.
Another spin-off entitled "" was released for the Nintendo DS handheld game console but with more puzzle based gameplay and only controlling the minions. Both Nintendo spin-offs were developed by Climax Studios while Triumph Studios would work on developing "Overlord II". All three games were released during June 2009.
A new installment in the series, "" was announced in April 2015. The game was released on 20 October 2015, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and supports co-operative multiplayer upon launch.

Unhook the Stars

Unhook the Stars is a 1996 American drama film directed by Nick Cassavetes, and starring his mother Gena Rowlands, Marisa Tomei, Gérard Depardieu, Jake Lloyd in his film debut, David Sherrill, David Thornton, Bridgette Wilson and Moira Kelly.
Rowlands plays Mildred, a widow who befriends the wayward Monica (Tomei), a single mother from across the street, and eventually finds herself babysitter of Monica's young son, J.J. (Lloyd) Throughout the film, Monica and J.J. inadvertently teach Mildred valuable life lessons about herself and her relationships with others.
Rowlands and Tomei both received SAG Award nominations for their performances. The film's title refers to a song of the same name by Cyndi Lauper, which can be heard over the closing credits.
Plot.
Mildred is a widow living with her rebellious, irresponsible twentysomething daughter Annie in Salt Lake City. One day after a fight, Annie goes to live as a vagrant with her boyfriend, leaving Mildred alone for the first time in her life. Her wayward neighbor Monica knocks on Mildred's door, begging her to watch her young son J.J. so she can go to her work shift. Monica has kicked her abusive husband Frankie out of their house.
Mildred agrees to watch J.J., and offers to babysit and take him to school whenever Monica needs her to. Establishing a close relationship with J.J. and Monica, he eventually comes to refer to her as "Auntie Mildred." Mildred reads to him, takes him to the park, and educates him on history by reading from her encyclopedias. At Thanksgiving, Mildred invites Monica and J.J. over for dinner as well as her yuppie son Ethan and his wife Jeannie. Jeannie is perturbed by Monica's brash behavior and cursing, though Ethan and Mildred seem disaffected by her personality. Ethan suggests that Mildred should move to San Francisco with him and Jeannie.
Mildred spends Christmas with Monica and J.J., and babysits him on New Year's Eve. On Valentine's Day, Frankie comes to Monica's in the middle of the night, begging to reunite with her. She quietly listens to his pleas, but does not open the door. Monica gets a babysitter for J.J. so she can go out for a night with Mildred, taking her to a local pub where she introduces her to her friend Big Tommy, a truck driver who expresses interest in Mildred. Monica leaves the bar without telling Mildred, so Big Tommy gives Mildred a ride home.
Mildred goes to visit Ethan and Jeannie in San Francisco, where he invites her to live on the top floor of their luxurious house overlooking the Bay Area, and reveals that Jeannie is pregnant. She ultimately refuses Ethan's offer, enraging him. Mildred returns home to find that Monica and Frankie have reconciled, and J.J. begins spending more time with his father, leaving Mildred depressed and alone.
One night, Mildred returns home to find Annie there. She asks if she could return home, saying that she now has a job and is applying to college. However, Mildred tells her that she has sold the house, and has to be out by the end of the month. Mildred goes on a date with Tommy, and confesses she doesn't know where she's moving to.
While Monica helps Mildred pack her house, she tells her how much Frankie has improved as a husband, but senses Mildred's distance. Frankie brings J.J. over, and he asks to talk to Mildred in private. J.J. gives her a drawing and thanks her for taking care of him, and the three say their goodbyes. Annie drives Mildred to the airport, though Mildred refuses to tell her where she's going, saying it's a secret.
Production.
Parts of the film were shot in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
The film was co-produced by the French company HPGD, a subsidiary of Hachette group created in association with actor Gérard Depardieu. After developing a passion for the films directed by John Cassavetes, Depardieu had bought the distribution rights for most of them, to introduce them to a new audience in France. Having befriended the Cassavetes family, he decided to support Nick Cassavetes' directorial debut by producing and appearing in his film.
Release.
The film was released theatrically in the United States on November 1, 1996 in a limited release in New York City. The film grossed a total of $272,542USD playing on three screens. The film later received a wider release on Valentine's Day 1997.
Critical reception.
"Unhook the Stars" received generally positive critical reaction. Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, calling it "a film of gentleness and low-key romance," and praised Rowlands' performance. "Entertainment Weekly" gave the film a B− rating, also praising the film's performances.
"The New York Times" also praised the performances in the film, but gave an ambivalent review, stating: "The impressive acting can cover up only so many glaring holes in a film that doesn't really know what it wants to say. "Unhook the Stars" isn't a story that had to be told but a sentimental contrivance constructed around its star."

When Your Heart Stops Beating (song)

"When Your Heart Stops Beating" is a song by American rock band +44, released on November 14, 2006 as the second single from the group's debut studio album, "When Your Heart Stops Beating" (2006). "When Your Heart Stops Beating" was released to radio on October 3, 2006. The song was the only single from the album to chart, peaking at number 14 on "Billboard" Modern Rock Tracks chart.
Background.
The title track, "When Your Heart Stops Beating", features "snotty, mid-range British-sounding Telecasters" and was inspired by the story of Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen — "you love your lady and outside of that, fuck everything else," according to Hoppus. Barker built the song around the driving bass drum beat: "I kind of approached it like a rock steady or like an old like four on the floor ska song, but played more like a rock drummer, like if a rock drummer was accidentally playing that stuff [...] It was kind of new wave and I felt like it needed a driving four on the floor." The track's percussion has been compared to that of Police drummer Stewart Copeland.
Music video.
The music video for "When Your Heart Stops Beating" was shot on September 9, 2006 in Los Angeles and directed by Liz Friedlander and Sheli Jury. +44 put out an open casting call for the group's fans to appear in the video. The video is a "pretty stock shoot of a group playing in an abandoned warehouse whilst all around people dance and couples are seen arguing."
The band embarked on a promotional tour of the United Kingdom in late 2006; Barker was in constant pain but soldiered through the performances, altering his kit set-up to accommodate. "He is now using his left foot as his right arm, Def Leppard style," confirmed Hoppus. A doctor informed Barker he had broken a bone in his arm during the band's video shoot and was instructed to immediately rest and not take part in the band's upcoming live dates, including early 2007 jaunts to Australia and Europe. Barker nevertheless took part, but after an excruciating Amsterdam gig, the band drafted Gil Sharone, then of The Dillinger Escape Plan, to fill-in for him.

William Weston Patton

William Weston Patton (October 19, 1821 – October 21, 1889), was an abolitionist, academic administrator, and scholar. He served as the fifth president of Howard University, and one of the contributors to the words of "John Brown's Body". He was the son of Rev. William Patton and the grandson of Anglo-Irish Congregationalist immigrant and Revolutionary War soldier Major Robert Patton.
Abolitionism.
Patton took an earnest part in the anti-slavery movement, and was chairman of the committee that presented to President Lincoln, September 13, 1862, the memorial [resolutions] from Chicago asking him to issue a proclamation of emancipation.
In 1887, Patton read a paper before the Maryland Historical Society entitled "President Lincoln and the Chicago Memorial on Emancipation" recalling the actual dialogue with President Lincoln at that meeting on Thursday, September 13, 1862. The original copy of that paper is held in the Mugar Memorial Library at Boston University. He was vice-president of the Northwestern sanitary commission during the American Civil War, and as such repeatedly visited the eastern and western armies, publishing several pamphlet reports. In 1886, he went, on behalf of the freedmen, to Europe, where, and in the Orient, he remained nearly a year.
"John Brown's Body".
In October 1861 Patton wrote new lyrics to the battle song "John Brown's Body", the first with complete verses and a consistent meter. These were published in the "Chicago Tribune" on December 16, 1861. Even more than the previous words, the new words glorify the violent anti-slavery acts of the abolitionist John Brown and his followers. The third verse directly refers to the attack on the armory in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Verse four compares John Brown to John the Baptist.&lt;poem&gt;He captured Harper’s Ferry, with his nineteen men so few,
And frightened "Old Virginny" till she trembled thru and thru;
They hung him for a traitor, themselves the traitor crew,
But his soul is marching on.
John Brown was John the Baptist of the Christ we are to see,
Christ who of the bondmen shall the Liberator be,
And soon thruout the Sunny South the slaves shall all be free,
For his soul is marching on.&lt;/poem&gt;These themes were further refined two months later by Julia Ward Howe; her version came to be known as "The Battle Hymn of the Republic". Where Patton only wrote "of the Christ we are to see", Howe testified that "her eyes" had already "seen the glory of the coming of the Lord".
Academic career.
Patton graduated from New York University in 1839 and Union Theological Seminary in 1842. After taking charge of a Congregational church in Boston, Massachusetts for three years, he became a pastor of one in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1846, and in Chicago, Illinois, in 1857. He received the degree of D.D. from DePauw University, Indiana, in 1864, and that of LL.D. from New York University in 1882.
From 1867-72, he was editor of "The Advance" in that city, and during 1874 he was lecturer on modern skepticism at Oberlin College (Ohio) and Chicago theological seminaries. From 1877-89 he was president of Howard University (Washington, D.C.), filling the chair of natural theology and evidences of Christianity in its theological department.
Publications.
Patton is the author of "The Young Man" (Hartford, 1847; republished as "The Young Man's Friend", Auburn, New York, 1850); "Conscience and Law" (New York, 1850); "Slavery and Infidelity" (Cincinnati, 1856); "Spiritual Victory" (Boston, 1874); and "Prayer and Its Remarkable Answers" (Chicago, 1875).

North Bend State Park

North Bend State Park sits on along the North Fork of the Hughes River in Ritchie County near Harrisville, West Virginia. The park is named after the sharp bend in the river that the formed three sides of the original park boundary. The North Bend Rail Trail, a 72-mile (116 km) hiking and biking corridor, is also managed as a unit of the park. A new 305 acre (1.23 km2) lake was recently added to the park.
Accessibility.
Accessibility for the disabled was assessed by West Virginia University. The assessment found the campground, picnic area, fishing area, and swimming pool to be accessible. The 2005 assessment found issues with access to the lodge, handrails, emergency exits at the lodge and signage in the lodge parking lot.
The park also features two special amenities designed to accommodate handicapped users.

Tanglefoot (band)

Tanglefoot was a Canadian folk band from Owen Sound, Ontario. Formed in Peterborough in the early 1980s by schoolteachers Joe Grant, Bob Wagar, and Tim Rowat to play traditional music, they became a five-piece band playing largely original music. They regularly toured Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
Overview.
The band has toured frequently throughout Canada and the United States, and also regularly in the UK. The band's song subjects are largely derived from history, especially Canadian history. Subject have included the Frank Slide, The War of 1812, Laura Secord, the first flight in Canada, and the tale of Sir John A Macdonald's wife Agnes Macdonald riding the cowcatcher across Canada.
Tanglefoot's lineup from 2007 on was: Steve Ritchie (guitar and whistle), the band's longest-serving member, Al Parrish (double bass), Terry Young (multi-instrumentalist incl guitar, mandolin, banjo, harmonica, whistle), Sandra Swannell (fiddle and viola), and Rob Ritchie (piano), returning after a five-year hiatus to replace departing pianist Bryan Weirmier. All the members sang and all, to varying degrees, wrote for the band.
After performing for nearly three decades, Tanglefoot ended their run with a pair of farewell concerts at the Roxy Theatre in Owen Sound, Ontario. In a comment on 27 June 2009 Al Parrish said that there was no bitterness in the breakup, but after more than twenty years the time had come to call it a day. Parrish also said there was a possibility of reunion gigs in the future, but nothing was planned.
In October 2010, all five band members appeared together back at the Roxy Theatre for a leukemia fundraiser. The concert was billed as "The My Sweet Patootie Show with special guests, Al Parrish, Rob Ritchie &amp; Steve Ritchie". Organized by former Tanglefoot members Sandra Swannell and Terry Young (who had founded their own group My Sweet Patootie), the concert featured all five performers in a variety of configurations but they played only a couple of Tanglefoot songs and the event was not particularly a "Tanglefoot reunion".
In September 2012, the founding members of Tanglefoot (Joe Grant, Tim Rowat and Bob Wagar) were inducted into the Pathway of Fame in Peterborough, Ontario.
Three longstanding members of Tanglefoot – guitarist/vocalist Steve Ritchie, bassist/vocalist Al Parrish and keyboardist/vocalist Rob Ritchie teamed up with drummer/percussionist/vocalist Beaker Granger in 2012 and currently perform and record as RPR.

The Trimates

The Trimates, sometimes called Leakey's Angels, is a name given to three women — Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, and Birutė Galdikas — chosen by anthropologist Louis Leakey to study primates in their natural environments. They studied chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, respectively.
Background.
Louis Leakey's interest in primate ethology stemmed from his attempts to recreate the environment in which the primate, "Proconsul", lived in the Rusinga Island region. He saw similarities between this environment and the habitat of the chimpanzees and gorillas. He had been trying to find observers since 1946. In 1956, he sent his secretary, Rosalie Osborn, to Mount Muhabura in Uganda to "help habituate" gorillas, but she returned to England after four months. Leakey was considering taking the job himself when Jane Goodall providentially brought herself to his attention.
To fund Goodall's research at the Gombe Stream Preserve, Leakey created the Tigoni Primate Research Center, north of Nairobi, Kenya, in 1958. With donations from sources including the National Geographic Society and the Wilkie Foundation, the Tigoni Research Center helped secure funding for all three of the women Leakey dubbed the "Trimates". After Kenya achieved independence the center became the National Primate Research Center. It later became the Institute of Primate Research of the National Museums of Kenya, located in Nairobi.
At the time of Leakey's death in 1972, Goodall and Dian Fossey had progressed significantly in their long-term field research in Africa, while Birutė Galdikas was just getting underway with her field studies in Indonesia. A fourth researcher, Toni Jackman, had been selected to study bonobos in Africa, but the necessary financing and permits had not yet been secured before Leakey's death.
Jane Goodall.
Jane Goodall began her first field study of chimpanzee culture in the Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania. Goodall had always been passionate about animals and Africa, which brought her to the farm of a friend in the Kenya highlands in 1957. From there, she obtained work as a secretary, but acting on her friend's advice she telephoned Louis Leakey with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. The call was far-reaching in its impact. Leakey was looking for a chimpanzee researcher but he kept the idea to himself for a time. Instead, he insisted Goodall could work for him as a secretary. After obtaining the approval of his co-researcher and wife, noted British paleoanthropologist Mary Leakey, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge, where he confessed his plans. The funds had to be found first.
In 1958, Leakey sent Goodall to London to study primate behavior with Osman Hill and primate anatomy with John Napier. The funds were found in that year, and in 1960 Goodall went to Gombe with her mother Vanne Morris-Goodall. The presence of Vanne was necessary to satisfy the requirements of David Anstey, chief warden, who was concerned for their safety. He cancelled the permit briefly. After Goodall was sent to observe vervet monkeys, the permit was reinstated.
Dian Fossey.
In 1967, Dian Fossey began her extended study of mountain gorillas in the Virunga Mountains of Rwanda. She had lived a somewhat reclusive life as an occupational therapist working with disabled children in California. Earlier she had been interested in veterinary science. In 1963 she decided to seek adventure in Africa and took a trip there with borrowed money. Happening to visit Olduvai, she came to Leakey's attention by spraining her ankle, falling into the excavation, and vomiting on a giraffe fossil.
Fossey returned home to repay the money. In 1966, Leakey happened to be in Louisville lecturing. Fossey attended the lecture, spoke momentarily to Leakey, and to her surprise he remembered her and asked her to stay after the lecture. The next day after an hour's interview at Leakey's hotel, he hired her to observe gorillas, taking up where George Schaller had left off. On January 6, 1967, she arrived at the Virunga Mountains in a Land Rover with Alan Root and a small party and hiked into the mountains, where she set up camp. Root left. Fossey began to succeed in observation almost from the beginning. She seemed to have an empathy with the gorillas, and continued to both study them and defend them from local poachers until her murder in 1985.
Birutė Galdikas.
Goodall and Fossey were well under way in their study programs in Africa when Birutė Galdikas attended a March 1969 lecture by Leakey at UCLA, where she was a student. She had already formed the intention of studying orangutans, and stayed after the lecture to solicit Leakey's help. In between his conversations with other fans, she managed to tentatively convince him to support her orangutan research. Leakey did wish to find an observer of orangutans and had asked Goodall to do it years before, but Goodall refused, as she was preoccupied by the chimpanzees.
Leakey interviewed Galdikas the next day at the home of Joan and Arnold Travis, Leakey's base in Southern California during his regular lecture tours on the West coast. Leakey accepted the application and over the next months set up an expedition with the necessary permissions. In 1971, she began field studies of orangutans in the jungles of Borneo.

Philadelphia Skating Club and Humane Society

The Philadelphia Skating Club and Humane Society is the oldest figure skating club in the United States.
History.
The predecessor organization, called "The Skater's Club of the City and County of Philadelphia", was founded in 1849, and merged with the assets of the Humane Society of Philadelphia in 1861. The latter organization was patterned after the Royal Humane Society; the original purpose of the club was to patrol outdoor skating areas around the city of Philadelphia, such as the Schuylkill River, in order to rescue skaters who had fallen through the ice. Club regulations still require members to carry a reel of stout twine for lifesaving purposes while skating outdoors.
In 1921, the Philadelphia Skating Club and Humane Society was one of the seven original clubs which formed the United States Figure Skating Association. It is one of the few clubs in the United States that owns its own rink, located in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, which opened in 1938.
Today, the Philadelphia Skating Club and Humane Society retains its traditions of both on and off-ice social events and activities while offering year-round recreational and competitive figure skating.
Notable skaters who have represented the club over the years include Dick Button, Scott Hamilton, and ice dance partners Kimberly Navarro and Brent Bommentre.
Competitions.
PSC&amp;HS hosts two annual competitions. Challenge Cup in September and Boots and Blades in April. Challenge Cup is a US Figure Skating National Qualifying Series event first held in 1982. It includes singles and ice dance events from No Test to Senior levels. Boots and Blades is a non-qualifying competition for skaters at the Snowplow Sam to Preliminary test levels; it also includes solo dance and showcase events. The club periodically hosts the Philadelphia Areas Figure Skating Championships (commonly known as "All-Areas") on behalf of The Association of Philadelphia Area Figure Skating Clubs.
The US Figure Skating Eastern Adult Sectional championships were held at PSC&amp;HS in March 2020.
Synchronized skating teams.
PSC&amp;HS has several adult and junior synchronized skating teams that compete as Philly Spirit. The three junior teams are known as the Philly Spirit Starlets.

Charles Thomas Fuchs (November 18, 1913 – June 10, 1969) was a Major League Baseball pitcher for the Detroit Tigers (1942), Philadelphia Phillies (1943), St. Louis Browns (1943), and Brooklyn Dodgers (1944). The , left-hander was a native of Union Hill, New Jersey (now part of Union City, New Jersey).
Fuchs is one of many ballplayers who only appeared in the major leagues during World War II. Making his major league debut in relief on April 17, 1942, against the St. Louis Browns at Sportsman's Park, his first major league win came just two days later. He started the second game of a doubleheader against the same St. Louis Browns and pitched a 1–0 complete game shutout.
In three seasons Fuchs appeared in a total of 47 games and had a 6–10 record, 13 starts, 5 complete games, 2 shutouts, 13 games finished, and 1 save. He allowed 90 earned runs in 165 innings pitched for a final ERA of 4.89. He was not a good hitter (3-for-43...an .070 batting average), but he was a competent fielder, handling 50 of 52 total chances successfully for a fielding percentage of .962.
Fuchs died at the age of 56 in Weehawken, New Jersey.

Will Rogers High School

Will Rogers Middle and High School, located at 3909 E. 5th Place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was built by Tulsa Public Schools in 1939 using WPA workers and designed by Joseph R. Koberling, Jr. and Leon B. Senter. It was named for the humorist Will Rogers, who died in 1935, along with Wiley Post in a plane crash. Significant additions were made to the original structure in 1949 and 1964. The alterations were in keeping with the original design and did not detract from the school's architectural or historical significance. It has been called "... one of the best examples of Art Deco high school architecture...in the United States.
The school had approximately 1,000 students as of 2008, and more than 39,000 alumni.
History.
The growth of the oil industry in Tulsa spurred a major population explosion that created a huge demand for homes and schools through the 1910s and 1920s. By 1920, Tulsa had built three senior high schools: Central in the downtown area, Booker T. Washington in North Tulsa and Clinton in West Tulsa. The Board of Education had already realized the urgent need for two more such schools, one on the west side of Tulsa and the other on the east side.
The school board received a grant from the federal Public Works Administration for both the westside and eastside schools on October 22, 1936. This was the seed money that allowed the preparation of bids, which were opened in July, 1937.
The school occupies a site within a residential area. In September, 1936, the Tulsa School District bought the tract in the southwestern quarter of Section 4, Township 19N, Range 13E from Mr. and Mrs. Fred Turner. It is bounded by East 4th Place South Street on the north, South Pittsburg Avenue on the east, East 5th Place South on the south, and Turner Park on the west. As originally constructed, the structure contained 200,000 sq. ft. of space. A 1949 addition to the east wing contained 21,016 square feet of space. An addition to the west wing in 1964 added four levels of classroom space.
In the 2008/09 school year, Rogers English teacher Brian Grimm was honored with the district's title of "teacher of the Year". Tulsa Public Schools has 83 schools and 3,300 teachers and staff.
The school's colors are royal blue and gold, the mascot is a Roper (i.e. a cowboy who specializes in using a rope to manage cattle) and the students are known as the Ropers. The school's symbol is based upon the dogiron (branding iron) used by the Rogers family.
On September 6, 2007, the Will Rogers High School building was added to the National Register of Historic Places with national significance. It is an example of Art Deco. The National Park Service has stated that it is one of the best examples of Art Deco high school architecture in the United States.
Building description.
The 1939 building was constructed with a basement and three stories.
Change to dual enrollment school.
In 2011, Tulsa Public Schools converted Will Rogers High School to a dual enrollment school for students offering those who complete the program at Rogers up to 66 college units, the equivalent of an associate degree. It has been since renamed "Will Rogers College Junior High and High School." The student body consists of grades 6 through 12, eliminating the traditional middle school. The first graduating class after this change was in 2014.
Tulsa Will Rogers High School Foundation.
The school has a group of alumni who run the Tulsa Will Rogers High School Foundation, which provides grants and scholarships to Rogers faculty and students. The foundation was established in the 1990s and continues to this day.

Larry Haney

Wallace Larry Haney (born November 19, 1942) is an American former catcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played from 1966 to 1978 for the Baltimore Orioles, Seattle Pilots / Milwaukee Brewers, Oakland Athletics, and St. Louis Cardinals. Haney later served as bullpen coach with the Brewers. His son, Chris Haney, pitched in the majors, primarily for the Kansas City Royals. During a 13-year baseball career, he hit .215, with 12 home runs and 73 runs batted in.
Haney was valued by teams mainly for his defensive abilities. In addition to his .985 fielding percentage and skill at working with pitching staffs, he threw out 110 of 282 stolen base attempts (39.0%) and picked off nine baserunners during his career. He was acquired three separate times by the Oakland A's, and was on their roster during their entire World Championship year of 1974.
On July 27, 1966, Haney hit a home run in his first major league game (second at bat) against John O'Donoghue of the Cleveland Indians.
On September 6, 1968, Haney had his first and only four-hit game, when he hit three singles and a double against the Chicago White Sox. He also recorded five three-hit games in his career.
Haney played in two World Series games for the Oakland A's in 1974 against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
In his minor league career, he led California League catchers with 18 double plays and 38 passed balls while playing for the Stockton Ports in 1962, and led Eastern League catchers with 17 double plays while playing for the Elmira Pioneers in 1963.
After his major league career, Haney went to work for the Milwaukee Brewers organization. He was a major league coach in 1978–91, serving as bullpen coach from 1978 until 1989 and pitching coach in 1990 and 1991. He continued working for the Brewers in various capacities until .
Haney's Topps baseball cards for 1968 and 1969 are popular because the 1969 card is simply the reverse image of the 1968 card. He appears as a left-handed throwing catcher (with a mitt that fits on his right hand) in the 1969 card. The player/coach in the background (of both cards) is also reversed.

Pennsylvania Route 33

Pennsylvania Route 33 (PA 33) is a freeway in eastern Pennsylvania. The highway runs from its interchange with Interstate 78 (I-78) south of Easton in the Lehigh Valley to I-80 and PA 611 west of Stroudsburg.
Until 2002, the route's southern terminus was at U.S. Route 22 (US 22), and the extension south of the US 22 interchange is known as the Gen. Anthony Clement McAuliffe Memorial Highway, named in honor of American World War II general Anthony McAuliffe. The route is commonly used as a hazmat bypass for the Pennsylvania Turnpike's Northeast Extension due to the restrictions in place on the Lehigh Tunnel. PA 33 provides a freeway connection between the Lehigh Valley and Pocono Mountains regions of Pennsylvania.
As of March 2016, PA 33 north of the US 22 interchange in Bethlehem Township was the busiest state highway or street in the Lehigh Valley with an average of 68,800 vehicles daily.
Route description.
Northampton County.
PA 33 begins at a trumpet interchange with I-78 in Lower Saucon Township in Northampton County, which is in the Lehigh Valley. From this interchange, the route heads northwest as a four-lane freeway onto the Gene Hartzell Memorial Bridge, passing over Norfolk Southern's Lehigh Line and the Lehigh River, where the highway briefly cuts through the southwestern tip of Easton and then crosses the Lehigh Canal into Bethlehem Township. Past the bridge, the freeway passes farm fields before it comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with Freemansburg Avenue in a business area adjacent to St. Luke's Hospital. Following this, PA 33 curves north near commercial development and reaches a diamond interchange with William Penn Highway, with a park and ride lot located at the northwest quadrant of this interchange. The route heads near a mix of residential development and farmland, curving northeast before turning north and coming to a cloverleaf interchange with the US 22 freeway.
After the US 22 interchange, the freeway crosses into Lower Nazareth Township and reaches a half-folded diamond interchange with Hecktown Road. PA 33 continues north past farm fields and curves northeast as it comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with PA 248 in a business area.
The route enters Palmer Township and runs through a mix of farm fields and industrial development, coming to a diamond interchange with Main Street that serves Tatamy and the warehouse district to the east. The freeway curves north and crosses Bushkill Creek into Stockertown, where it passes over Norfolk Southern's Cement Secondary line and a railroad spur and turns northwest to reach a diamond interchange with PA 191. PA 33 continues past industrial areas and leaves Stockertown for Plainfield Township, passing over a Norfolk Southern railroad spur. The route heads into wooded areas and crosses into Bushkill Township, where it reaches a diamond interchange with Henry Road serving Belfast to the east. A park and ride lot is located within the southeast quadrant of this interchange.
Past this interchange, the freeway heads east of the Jacobsburg Environmental Education Center as it continues through woodland with some farm fields and residential development. PA 33 turns north and crosses back into Plainfield Township, where it comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with PA 512 in an area of businesses that serves Wind Gap. Past this interchange, the freeway heads into forested areas, heading through a gap in the Blue Mountain ridge, with a partial diamond interchange with Broadway (Old PA 115) providing southbound access to Wind Gap and the Appalachian Trail.
Monroe County.
PA 33 crosses into Hamilton Township and continues through forested areas, turning northwest and briefly entering Ross Township before curving back northeast. The route reaches Saylorsburg, where a southbound exit and entrance connects to Wilkes Barre Turnpike (Old PA 115) and a northbound exit and entrance connects to Cherry Valley Road. From here, PA 33 turns northeast and runs through wooded areas with some fields and homes, soon making a curve to the north at a trumpet interchange with US 209, at which point US 209 joins PA 33 in a concurrency on the freeway. The two routes continue northeast through woodland with some development, crossing McMichael Creek and coming to a diamond interchange with Manor Drive that serves Snydersville.
From here, the freeway passes west of Monroe County Correctional Facility and crosses Appenzell Creek before PA 33 exits northbound from the US 209 expressway, with signs leading travelers to eastbound and from westbound I-80 via US 209. After this, PA 33 reaches a southbound exit and northbound entrance with US 209 Bus. that serves Snydersville. The route continues northeast through wooded areas, passing to the northwest of Snydersville Raceway before turning north. The freeway heads through forested areas with some homes, curving to the north-northeast and crossing Pocono Creek. The route comes to a partial interchange with I-80, with no access from northbound PA 33 to eastbound I-80 or from westbound I-80 to southbound PA 33, the missing movements being provided by US 209 at the freeway split. Past this, PA 33 crosses into Stroud Township and reaches its northern terminus at an at-grade traffic light with PA 611 in a business area.
History.
20th century.
The construction of PA 33 started in 1959, and stretched from the PA 512 interchange to Saylorsburg. Construction finished in 1960. The stretch connecting the highway to I-80 was built and completed by 1964. Construction on PA 33 was not continued until 1969 when work began on the stretch from PA 512 in Wind Gap to Henry Road in Belfast. This stretch was completed by 1970. By 1972, the road had reached what is now PA 191 in Stockertown, and was extended down to its long-term southern terminus at US 22. The highway was left at that until 1999 when construction began on a final segment that would connect the US 22 interchange to I-78. The final three-mile (5 km) stretch opened in January 2002.
21st century.
In January 2004, the freeway was shut down between Lower Nazareth Township (PA 248) and Stockertown (PA 191) because of a sinkhole that was in the area of the Bushkill Creek directly under a northbound bridge support beam. Crossovers were created, narrowing the highway to one lane in each direction through Stockertown. Studies were conducted, and came to the conclusion that the bridge was dangerous and could not be fixed. The northbound bridge was demolished in February of the same year. Just 21 days later, a sinkhole was discovered under the southbound bridge over the Bushkill Creek, and resulted in the demolition of the southbound bridge. Once the new northbound bridge was completed, another crossover was created, detouring southbound traffic onto the northbound side of the highway. On April 21, 2004, a depression formed under the new northbound bridge, and the highway was shut down once again to fill the area with bituminous material. The bridge re-opened within twenty minutes. By November 19, 2004, both bridges were completed and opened. All of this happened feet from the Bushkill Street Bridge connecting Stockertown and Palmer Township, which has been closed since 1999 because of numerous sinkholes causing the bridge to collapse.
On March 21, 2009, a tractor-trailer carrying 32,000 pounds of hydrofluoric acid overturned on southbound PA 33 in Plainfield Township, prompting the evacuation of about 5,000 people. The truck, registered to the Honeywell company, flipped over at about 2:40 a.m. after the driver swerved to avoid a deer. No one was injured, and the highway was reopened later that day. Hundreds of evacuees were taken to the Pen Argyl Area High School in nearby Pen Argyl.
On January 31, 2013, ground was broken for a new interchange at Main Street in Palmer Township to the west of Tatamy, with Governor Tom Corbett in attendance. This interchange is being constructed to serve the Palmer Industrial Park and is expected to bring economic development to the area. Completion of this interchange, which is to cost $40 million, was originally planned for November 2014. However, work on the project was halted during the winter of 2014-2015, with completion pushed back to June 2015.

Madurai Mani Iyer

Madurai Mani Iyer (; 25 October 1912 – 8 June 1968) was an Indian Carnatic music singer, who was famous for his unique style. He was one of the most highly celebrated carnatic vocalists during the first half of the 20th century. He was renowned for his adept skills at singing kalpana swarams, neraval, and raga alapana. His music continues to be highly regarded today.
Early life.
Madurai Mani Iyer, whose original name was Subramanian, was born to M. S. Ramaswamy Iyer and Subbulakshmi in Madurai on 25 October 1912. His father, a Sub-court Clerk, was the brother of the famous Vidwan Pushpavanam, who was a great classical musician himself.
Mani Iyer's tutelage in music started at the age of nine. His first guru was Sri Rajam Bhagavathar who was Disciple of Ettayapuram Ramachandra Bhagavathar. Through Rajam Bhagavathar, he came in close contact with the great musician and composer, Gayakasikhamani Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavatar who founded Shri Thyagaraja Sangeetha Vidyalayam, a music school at Madurai and became an early disciple of the School.
Awards.
Iyer's prodigious talents were recognized early in his age as he received various honours from dignitaries of that time. In 1927, a music conference took place at the Congress session in Avadi. In that was arranged a programme on the 72 melaragamalika of Maha Vaidyanatha Iyer. Mani's father expounded on the theoretical aspect of the composition while Mani sang. Father and son walked away with the awards. The Ganakaladharar in 1944, Sangeetha Kalanidhi in 1959, President's award in 1960, Isai Perarignar in 1962 and many more came his way. He is also known for his English note.
An autodidact.
Madurai Mani Iyer was indeed passionate about music but he had other interests too and one of them was the English language. Though a school drop out, Mani Iyer mastered this language and an anecdote goes that he would trudge from his house in Mylapore all the way to the Connemara Library to pick up books in English. He loved Bernard Shaw and was a fan of Charlie Chaplin. A compulsive listener of both the English and the Tamil news, Mani Iyer was a keen observer of politics too.

Tai Po Waterfront Park () is a park in Tai Po in the New Territories of Hong Kong. It is located along the Tolo Harbour, and its western end is at the northern part of the mouth of the Lam Tsuen River. It occupies an area of , and is the largest park managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. The Park opened in 1994 at a cost of $210-million, but was not completed until 1997 with the creation of the Tai Po Lookout Tower.
Every year, the Tai Po Dragon Boat Race is held in the sea off the park.
Facilities.
The park has a wide range of public facilities including rest gardens, sitting-out areas, an insect house, a promenade along the harbour front, a jogging trail with fitness stations and a 600-seat amphitheatre. The park also has the only dedicated model boat pool in Hong Kong. The park is also the start of the popular cycle route to Tai Mei Tuk. Cycle hires are available in the park.
Lookout tower.
The lookout tower is high and gives visitors a panoramic view over Tolo Harbour, the Tai Po Industrial Estate and the rugged countryside stretching back to the boundary with mainland China.
The plaques of the lookout tower depict the history of Tai Po, including the struggle with the British army when they originally entered the New Territories, the heroic resistance against the Japanese army during the occupation and prosperity after World War II.

Chris Haney

Christopher Deane Haney (born November 16, 1968) is an American former Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher. He pitched from 1991–2000 and in 2002 for the Montreal Expos, Kansas City Royals, Chicago Cubs, Cleveland Indians, and Boston Red Sox.
Haney is the son of former catcher Larry Haney. He attended Orange County High School in Orange, Virginia. Haney pitched for the Charlotte 49ers and was the All-Sun Belt selection in both 1989 and 1990 and remains the program's leader with 20 complete games.
He was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the second round of the 1990 Major League Baseball draft. A year after signing, Haney made his major league debut for the Expos, and pitched for them for 1.5 years, then was traded to the Kansas City Royals on August 29, 1992 with Bill Sampen for Sean Berry and Archie Corbin.
Haney pitched for the Royals from 1992 to 1998. He had his best season in 1996, when he served as a full-time starter, finishing the year with a 10-14 record and a 4.67 earned run average.
On August 7, 1999, Wade Boggs of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays became the first major leaguer to hit a home run for his 3,000th hit, connecting against Haney. That October, Haney was left off the Indians' playoff roster. The decision to exclude him was blamed by some for the team's collapse against the Boston Red Sox in the 1999 American League Division Series.
In 2001, he played in Japan for the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. After retiring from baseball, he returned to Orange, Virginia, the town where he grew up.
In 2002, Haney returned to MLB and pitched for the Red Sox. He made 24 appearances, all in relief. He did not pick up any wins but on June 5, 2002, he did pick up his one and only career save against the Tigers.
Haney's son, Jacob, pitched from 2017–2022 at the College of William &amp; Mary.

<doc id="6954044" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6954044" title="Bob Sutton (American football)">
Bob Sutton (American football)

Bob D. Sutton (born January 28, 1951) is an American football coach serving as a senior defensive assistant of the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL). Sutton previously was the defensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs. Sutton served as the head football coach at the United States Military Academy from 1991 to 1999, compiling a record of 44–55–1.
Coaching career.
Sutton's first job in the coaching ranks came as a graduate assistant under Bo Schembechler at Michigan in 1972 and 1973. In 1974, he moved on to Syracuse University where he served as linebackers coach for the Orange. After just one year he began the first of two stints at Western Michigan University then onto the University of Illinois, where he was defensive coordinator and linebackers coach from 1977 to 1979. He returned to Western Michigan as offensive coordinator in 1980 and 1981. In 1982, he spent one season as running backs coach at North Carolina State University before beginning a long association with the United States Military Academy in 1983.
Army.
Sutton spent eight years as an assistant coach at Army before being named the head coach in 1991.
His nine-year tenure as the head football coach at Army (1991 to 1999) is third in length only to Earl "Red" Blaik and current Army coach Jeff Monken. Sutton compiled a record of 44–55–1 and guided the 1996 Army squad to a 10–2 record, an appearance in the Independence Bowl, and a top 25 finish in both major polls. For his efforts that season, Sutton was awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award.
New York Jets.
Sutton made the transition to the NFL coaching ranks with the New York Jets in 2000, beginning his tenure with the Jets as a linebackers coach before serving as the team's defensive coordinator from 2006 to 2008, senior assistant/linebackers coach from 2009 to 2011, and as assistant head coach/linebackers in 2012.
Kansas City Chiefs.
In January 2013 Sutton was named defensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs under new head coach Andy Reid. Unlike other NFL defensive coordinators, Sutton was distinguished by his "cordial and cerebral demeanor" which was the "calming and refreshing opposite of the drill sergeant caricature". The Chiefs finished in the top seven in scoring defense in each of Sutton's first four seasons, ranking second in 2014.
Despite the gradual year-over-year improvement in the Chiefs' win–loss record, Sutton drew growing criticism as the defense cost them playoff games, starting when the team blew the 38–10 lead to lose 44–45 to the Indianapolis Colts in 2014, and then suffered eliminations at the hands of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Tennessee Titans, and New England Patriots in the 2016–2018 postseasons; in these latter three losses the Chiefs had home advantage and surrendered a considerable amount of rushing yards. The 2018 season was generally a success for the Chiefs, largely due to an offense led by young quarterback Patrick Mahomes who led the league in points and yards per game. However, the defense ranked 31st in yards allowed (405.5), 24th in yards per play (5.85), and 24th in points per game (26.3), and giving up an average of 40.2 points in the five losses including those to the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks, while the only bright spot was leading the league in sacks and quarterback hurries. The "Kansas City Star's" Sam Mellinger noted that "The offense was a rocket ship, especially early, which meant the defense was often playing with the lead in obvious passing situations. That played to the group’s strength, which was the pass rush, and away from its weaknesses — stopping the run and quick passes". Sutton had reportedly lost the support of players and coaches who felt that his "lack of adjustments has been a non-stop frustration", so he was relieved of his duties two days after the loss to the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, when the Chiefs defense twice failed to hold a 4th quarter lead and surrendered several 3rd and long conversions on New England's game-winning touchdown drive in overtime. The overtime drive highlighted Sutton's weaknesses that cost him his job, as the Patriots largely converted those 3rd downs on near-identical plays. Notably, CBS commentator Tony Romo was successfully able to predict the plays based on the formation, which led to even more criticism of Sutton.
The following season, under new defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, Kansas City posted an identical 12–4 record despite injuries to Mahomes and several other key offensive pieces, as an improved defense gave Kansas City a more balanced team that went on to win the Super Bowl.
Atlanta Falcons.
In February 2019, the Atlanta Falcons named Sutton a Senior Assistant.
Jacksonville Jaguars.
Sutton became the senior defensive assistant of the Jacksonville Jaguars during the 2023 season. He, along with several other defensive staff members, were fired after the season.
Personal life.
Sutton earned his physical education degree from Eastern Michigan University. He and his wife, Debbie, have a son, a daughter, and three grandchildren.

Directory Services Restore Mode

Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) is a function on Active Directory Domain Controllers to take the server offline for emergency maintenance, particularly restoring backups of AD objects. It is accessed on Windows Server via the advanced startup menu, similarly to safe mode.
Password.
In Windows 2000, the DSRM password is typically created as a null value (blank), which is also the Recovery Console password. Starting with Windows Server 2003, a DSRM password must be defined when the domain controller is promoted.
Anyone with the password who has access to the domain controller can reboot the machine, copy and modify the Active Directory database, and reboot the server without leaving any trace of the activity. DSRM password changes cannot be scripted, but can be accomplished manually through the command line; DSRM passwords can also be automatically changed and audited using Privileged Identity Management software.
Alternatives.
On Windows Server 2008 R2, an "Active Directory Recycle Bin" was added, which allows on-line restoration of accidentally-deleted AD objects. Its functionality is reminiscent of Windows' own Recycle Bin function.

Whitley College

Whitley College is a Baptist theological institute in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The college is associated with the Baptist Union of Victoria (Australian Baptist Ministries) and is one of the theological schools of the University of Divinity.
History.
Whitley College was established in 1891 by the Collins Street Baptist Church as "Baptist Theological College of Victoria". William Thomas Whitley was invited to come to Melbourne from England to take up the position of Principal. He remained Principal for the next ten years.
In 1912 the college relocated to Errol Street, North Melbourne, under the leadership of Principal W.H. Holdsworth.
In 1958, Professor Mervyn Himbury was appointed Principal, and under his leadership, plans were developed for a new building to accommodate both the Theological College and a new residential college of the University of Melbourne. The new building, near the university in Royal Parade, Parkville, opened in 1965, and was renamed Whitley College in honour of William Thomas Whitley.
In 1975, Whitley's theological college joined with the Churches of Christ Theological College, now named Stirling Theological College, to establish the Evangelical Theological Association, which was accredited until 2005. Whitley and Stirling are now again separate colleges of the University of Divinity.
The Geoffrey Blackburn Library at Whitley was built in 2001 and contains approximately 30,000 theological books. It also contains the Boreham Collection, which includes books by and about Frank W. Boreham, as well as items from his personal collection.
In 2016, Principal Frank Rees and the College Council announced that Whitley College would cease to be a residential college of the University of Melbourne in December 2017, and continue solely as a theological teaching college of the University of Divinity. The residential building was sold to a commercial student accommodation provider.
The college then appointed Principal, Reverend Professor René Erwich who served until September 2023. Upon Professor Erwich's departure, Whitley's Dean of Research Rev Associate Professor Darrell Jackson stepped into the Interim Principal role, and was subsequently appointed as the next Principal.
Whitley College is currently operating from the St Paschal Precinct at 90 Albion Rd, Box Hill, until renovation works are completed at the Parkville Campus.
Academics.
In conjunction with the University of Divinity, prospective students at Whitley College are provided with a variety of degrees and courses for further study. The college offers undergraduate diplomas, undergraduate degrees, as well as graduate certificates, graduate diplomas, and master's degrees.
Accreditation.
Whitley College is a teaching and research college within the University of Divinity. The University of Divinity was constituted by the "University of Divinity Act 1910" (the "Melbourne College of Divinity Act 1910"), passed by the Parliament of Victoria. The Act, most recently amended in 2016, establishes the University Council and empowers it to confer awards as a higher education provider.
Awards and prizes.
Whitley College awards an annual prize for excellence in writing, named in honour of a notable author and theologian, Frederick Buechner. All students are encouraged to submit pieces and winners of the prize are selected by faculty members.

Homogeneous differential equation

A differential equation can be homogeneous in either of two respects. 
A first order differential equation is said to be homogeneous if it may be written
where and are homogeneous functions of the same degree of and . In this case, the change of variable leads to an equation of the form 
which is easy to solve by integration of the two members.
Otherwise, a differential equation is homogeneous if it is a homogeneous function of the unknown function and its derivatives. In the case of linear differential equations, this means that there are no constant terms. The solutions of any linear ordinary differential equation of any order may be deduced by integration from the solution of the homogeneous equation obtained by removing the constant term.
History.
The term "homogeneous" was first applied to differential equations by Johann Bernoulli in section 9 of his 1726 article "De integraionibus aequationum differentialium" (On the integration of differential equations).
Homogeneous first-order differential equations.
A first-order ordinary differential equation in the form:
is a homogeneous type if both functions and are homogeneous functions of the same degree . That is, multiplying each variable by a parameter , we find
Thus, 
Solution method.
In the quotient formula_6, we can let to simplify this quotient to a function of the single variable :
That is 
Introduce the change of variables ; differentiate using the product rule:
This transforms the original differential equation into the separable form
or
which can now be integrated directly: equals the antiderivative of the right-hand side (see ordinary differential equation).
Special case.
A first order differential equation of the form (, , , , , are all constants)
where 
can be transformed into a homogeneous type by a linear transformation of both variables ( and are constants):
where
For cases where , introduce the change of variables or ; differentiation yields:
or
for each respective substitution. Both may be solved via separation of variables.
Homogeneous linear differential equations.
A linear differential equation is homogeneous if it is a homogeneous linear equation in the unknown function and its derivatives. It follows that, if is a solution, so is , for any (non-zero) constant . In order for this condition to hold, each nonzero term of the linear differential equation must depend on the unknown function or any derivative of it. A linear differential equation that fails this condition is called inhomogeneous.
A linear differential equation can be represented as a linear operator acting on where is usually the independent variable and is the dependent variable. Therefore, the general form of a linear homogeneous differential equation is 
where is a differential operator, a sum of derivatives (defining the "0th derivative" as the original, non-differentiated function), each multiplied by a function of :
where may be constants, but not all may be zero.
For example, the following linear differential equation is homogeneous:
whereas the following two are inhomogeneous:
The existence of a constant term is a sufficient condition for an equation to be inhomogeneous, as in the above example.

Jim's, most well known for its breakfast and charbroiled hamburgers, was started in 1947 when Germano "Jim" Hasslocher and his business partner and wife Veva Ball Hasslocher built their first burger stand. At its peak, Jim's had locations in San Antonio, Austin, Houston, San Marcos, Waco, and Temple.
Jim Hasslocher remained CEO until his death on November 18, 2015 at the age of 93. The current CEO is their son, Jimmy Hasslocher. As of April 2024, Frontier Enterprises operates 12 locations in the San Antonio area and 3 in Austin. 
History.
Germano "Jim" Hasslocher and his wife and business partner Veva Ball Hasslocher founded Jim's Restaurants (originally named Jim's Coffee Shop) in 1963, but his first restaurants were Frontier Drive-In, which became Frontier Enterprises, Inc. Over the years, Frontier Enterprises included:
Frontier Drive-In primarily served hamburgers, onion rings, and milkshakes and became a drive-in burger concept with carhops which eventually led to full-service restaurants in several locations. Jim's Restaurants likewise became famous for their hamburgers as well as serving breakfast diner dishes 24 hours a day.
Relationship to Shoney's and Champs.
In 1998, Jim's Restaurants bought eight Shoney's, and converted them to Jim's. These restaurants did not do well financially.
Jim's Restaurant had several locations in Houston, which they sold. Terry Parsons, who worked as a manager with Frontier Enterprises for many years, took ownership of these Houston restaurants under a new name, Champs Restaurants, and opened several other, new restaurants within the new Champs chain.
Political influence.
Founder Jim Hasslocher was president of the National Restaurant Association lobbying organization in 1986, the Texas Restaurant Association in 1960, and the San Antonio Restaurant Association in 1956. Veva Hasslocher was a founding member and two-time president of the San Antonio Restaurant Association Women's Auxiliary. Their son the current CEO, Jimmy Hasslocher, served five terms on the San Antonio City Council, was the mayor pro-tem, sits on the board of the city hospital district, and also was the president of the Texas Restaurant Association.
As such, Jim's Restaurants CEOs have often been locally influential and vocally advocated for specific policies that they feel affect restaurant owners. Some positions they have taken include:
Estate feuds and pandemic scandal.
Jim and Veva Hasslocher had five children, all of whom worked for Frontier Enterprises at some point. Frontier Enterprises was a privately held family partnership under a parent company named Hasslocher Enterprises, that was worth an estimated $30 million in 2016 (equivalent to about $39 million in 2024). The parents established a succession plan with a no-contest clause in their wills. 
Veva died in 2009, and Jim died in 2015. In 2019, daughters Caryn and Susan Hasslocher filed a lawsuit against their brother and CEO Jimmy Hasslocher over ownership interests and payments. 
In 2020, when restaurants in Texas were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, Jim's Restaurants were again in the news: they furloughed about 1,000 employees even though they accepted more than $6.8 million from the Paycheck Protection Program to cover payroll and other costs during the business closure time. 
Jim's Restaurants continue to struggle after these recent scandals: several restaurants closed, and most of the remaining ones are open under reduced hours.

Frank Cordell

Frank Cordell (1 June 1918 – 6 July 1980) was a British composer, arranger and conductor, who was active with the Institute of Contemporary Arts. He also composed music under the name Frank Meilleur or Meillear (Meillear being his mother's maiden name).
Early life.
He was born Frank Cordell in Kingston-upon-Thames. His father was a doctor who served with the Royal Army Medical Corps in the First World War. Frank had two sisters. His brother, Sid Cordell, who was a professional musician, composed music for some of the Hammer Horror films based at Pinewood Studios. As a young teenager Frank worked briefly for Homfray &amp; Company in the cotton mills in Halifax and the Midlands for a family relative, before returning to London. By age 14, he was a competent pianist. Cordell entered a citywide London music contest and won a "Melody Maker" poll at the age of 17 for the most promising jazz pianist of 1935. This enabled him to secure a job as a sound man in one of the prestigious London Warner Bros. film studios.
Military service.
When World War II broke out Cordell enlisted in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and trained as a radio navigation operator, flying the Vickers Wellington in RAF Bomber Command. In his time between dangerous flying "ops", Cordell was in constant demand entertaining his squadron with popular piano music in the mess. On completing his 33 ops he was transferred to flying stealth De Havilland Mosquito bombers on the run between Britain and the Middle East. While in RAF Middle East he was later assigned as bandleader with his own group of musicians and a small convoy of lorries to entertain the British troops in the Western Desert Campaign. He was then appointed music director of the Forces Broadcasting Service in Cairo, where he conducted a weekly radio program called Music For Moderns. Among the friends and local Cairo artists he worked with was the singer, Delores El Greco. From there he was assigned to a double role of music entertainment and intelligence work in Palestine. It is in Palestine while music entertaining that he met his first wife Magda, who was a Hungarian refugee working for the British in translating intercepted wireless signals. Magda later became a "Brutalist" artist, and along with Cordell was a participant in the This Is Tomorrow Exhibit, and both were founder members of the Independent Group at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.
BBC work.
Cordell returned to Britain in 1947, resided on Higher Drive in Banstead, and joined the BBC as a composer, arranger, and orchestra conductor. Among the recording studios he used were the Abbey Road Studios in St John's Wood, and the Aeolian sound studio in Bond Street, he also worked with George Martin. Some of his early music hits were "Sadie's Shawl" (1956, UK #29) and "The Black Bear" (1961, UK #44), conducted by his own orchestra, as well as "Wheels Cha Cha", performed by Joe Loss (1961, UK #21) and his eponymous orchestra. Cordell was commended in 1951 for his radio score of the historical drama "The Gay Galliard", starring Valerie Hobson as Mary, Queen of Scots. He worked with most of the performers and musicians of the day including Noël Coward, Charlie Chaplin, vocalists such as Alma Cogan and Ronnie Hilton, and the jazz trumpet player Humphrey Lyttelton. In 1952, Cordell was drawn to the cinema and made his music film debut. He also commenced composing music for many advertising commercials for film and TV.
The Atelier.
It was in this 1952/3 period that Frank and Magda Cordell established an artistic atelier at 52 Cleveland Square in Paddington London, which they shared and artistically collaborated with the British Modern artist John McHale. The McHale/Cordell atelier occupied three floors in a large Georgian row house in Cleveland Square. Frank used the top floor with his piano and large windows overlooking the park as his music composing studio. John McHale occupied the large sky-lit studio at the back of the atelier on the ground floor. Magda used the other large painting studio downstairs, which was also used by all three artist as a film studio. McHale used the downstairs film studio to produce his photograms for his Telemath collage series. There was also a separate downstairs workshop and photographic dark room. The living room on the ground floor was used for entertaining guests such as: Reyner Banham and other members of the ICA group, musicians, writers such as Eric Newby, dramatists such as Arnold Wesker, and international guests such as Buckminster Fuller, and Picasso's son. Cordell made numerous tape recordings of Fuller.
Musical scores.
In 1955, Cordell left the BBC to become musical director of His Master's Voice, known subsequently as EMI, a post held until 1962 when he decided to become a full-time film composer, and scored the music for the film "The Captain's Table" (1959).
In the early 1960s, Cordell divorced Magda, who went with McHale to America. Cordell married his second wife, Anja, whom he met on film location in Japan while doing the music score for the film "Flight from Ashiya" (1964). He wrote the theme music for the spy adventure TV series starring Robert Lansing called "The Man Who Never Was" (1966–67), and wrote "The White Mountain" introductory music for the science fiction episode of "" – "Mission of the Darians" in 1975. Frank Cordell composed over twenty music scores including "The Voice of Merrill" (1952), "First on the Road" (1959), "The Rebel" (1961) starring Tony Hancock, "The Bargee" (1964), "Never Put It in Writing" (1964), "Khartoum" (1966), "Mosquito Squadron" (1969), "Ring of Bright Water" (1969), "Hell Boats" (1970), "Cromwell" (1970), "Trial by Combat" (1976), and "God Told Me To" (US: "Demon", 1976). Between his film scores Cordell wrote concert hall works including the "Concerto for Cello", the "Concerto for Horn", a wind quartet entitled "Interplay"; also pieces for saxophone quartet, "Gestures and Patterns", and mood miniatures such as "Production Drive".
He wrote choral music for the Choir of King's College, Cambridge; and an arrangement for strings of the English air "Oh Dear, What Can the Matter Be", available on Guild GED5104. He was nominated for the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for his feature film score of "Cromwell", 1970. Cordell was involved in several experimental and documentary films. These included a surrealist film made in Yugoslavia in 1957 with McHale and his three sons and Arnold Bittleman the Yale trained artist. Cordell also wrote the score for the documentary film "Tiger Tiger" (1977). He appeared in the "Fathers of Pop" interviewed by Reyner Banham in a 1970s TV documentary on the origins of British pop art.
Cordell also wrote two significant scores for brass band: "Spirals" (1977) and "Movements" (1981).
Later years.
Cordell retired with his wife and son to their sheep farm in the English countryside, where they kept open house to many of Britain's leading artists and musicians including The Beatles.
Cordell died in Hastings in 1980, and his original manuscripts now reside in the archives at the Trinity College of Music in London.

United Association

The United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada, commonly known as the United Association (UA), is a labor union which represents workers in the plumbing and pipefitting industries in the United States and Canada.
History.
Journeymen in the pipe trades in the 1880s worked in three basic crafts: plumbers, steamfitters and gasfitters.
The first truly successful national body, the United Association of Journeymen Plumbers, Gas Fitters, Steam Fitters, and Steam Fitters' Helpers of the United States and Canada, was officially founded on October 11, 1889.
Gradually, former members of rival unions joined the United Association. The depression of 1893–1897 slowed the development of a stronger organization. Membership in the United Association grew to 6,700 in 1893, but fell to 4,400 by 1897. Yet, by that year 151 local unions were listed on its rolls.
Starting in 1898, the construction industry entered a period of expansion and prosperity that lasted until 1914. From 1898 to 1906 the United Association quadrupled its membership.
During its first years, the United Association was essentially a federation of local unions, rather than a truly national union of the pipe trades. The major breakthrough toward a unified national organization came at the 1902 national convention in Omaha, when delegates approved a Nationalization Committee proposal establishing a comprehensive system of sick, death and strike benefits.
As such reforms to strengthen the national organization were being made in the early part of the century, however, some locals broke ranks to form a rival union. In August 1906, members of the secessionist union realized the futility of further rivalry and agreed to affiliate with the United Association.
From 1898 to 1914, the United Association went through several phases of a struggle with the International Association of Steam and Hot Water Fitters and Helpers, a prolonged and sometimes bitter dispute both over jurisdiction over a craft (steamfitting) and work assignments (plumbers vs. steamfitters). The conflict affected other building trades when walkouts by the rival steamfitting organizations, as a result of their jurisdictional dispute, led to work stoppages by other crafts.
The strength of the United Association, and favorable rulings by the American Federation of Labor, including the revocation of the International Association's charter in 1912, ended this jurisdictional battle, but other jurisdictional issues would continue to challenge the union.
New disputes arose over the construction of chemical plants and other manufacturing and service establishments that required extensive piping systems. Large volumes of newer types of pipefitting installation in the shift from World War I wartime industries to peacetime construction caused considerable difficulties. Jurisdictional problems also developed with other national unions, but the United Association retained jurisdiction over important, growing areas of work like construction of industrial plants, public utilities, petroleum facilities and residential buildings.
In the first half of the century, the United Association moved to formalize apprenticeship training programs, including making a five-year apprenticeship mandatory in 1921, and in 1938 holding that all apprentices be members of the United Association and attend related training classes. Its National Plumbing Apprenticeship Plan of 1936 was the first set of standards governing apprenticeship to win approval of the federal government.
In the Depression, United Association membership fell from its 1929 peak of 60,000 to 26,000 by 1933.
After several constitutional changes through the years, the 1946 convention changed the name of the organization to its present name: The United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada.
Throughout World War II and after, the United Association made considerable gains in membership and prestige. Between 1940 and 1954 membership surged from 60,000 to 240,000 with veterans entering the skilled craftsmen field.
United Association member George Meany was elected in 1952 to be president of the newly formed AFL-CIO and was to provide a shaping force in the American labor movement until his death in 1980.
The New Frontier of President John F. Kennedy and Great Society of President Lyndon Johnson were movements supported by the United Association. With expanded training programs beginning in 1956, the UA was able to meet the demands of accelerated construction activity in the 1960s. With the increased work the slogan, "There is no substitute for UA skilled craftsmen" became widespread throughout the industry. By 1971 the UA was 320,000 strong.
Composition.
According to UA's reports to the Department of Labor since 2000, the union has consistently had about 93 percent members in "building trades", the remaining 7 percent in "metal trades". Out of the total membership, most are considered "journeymen", with about 12 percent considered "apprentices". As of January 1, 2017, fourth- and fifth-year apprentices are eligible to vote in the union.
From humble beginnings of 40 delegates representing 23 independent unions in 10 states and the District of Columbia, the United Association has grown to a powerful, international union representing over 300,000 members in more than 300 local unions (LU) throughout the United States and Canada.
Constitution.
"The objects of this Association are to protect its members from unjust and injurious competition, and secure through unity of action among all workers of the industry throughout the United States and Canada, claiming, as we do, that labor is capital, and is the only capital that possesses power to reproduce itself or in other words, to create capital. Labor is the interest underlying all other interests; therefore, it is entitled to and should receive from society and government protection and encouragement."

Council on Chiropractic Education – USA

The Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE) is an American agency recognized by the United States Department of Education for accreditation of programs and institutions offering the Doctor of Chiropractic degree. The CCE seeks to ensure the quality of chiropractic education in the United States by means of accreditation, educational improvement, and public information. The CCE develops accreditation criteria to assess how effectively programs or institutions plan, implement, and evaluate their mission and goals, program objectives, inputs, resources, and outcomes of their chiropractic programs. The CCE is also recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and is a member of the Association of Specialized and Professional Accreditors (ASPA).
Accreditation.
During the 1950s and 1960s many chiropractic governing bodies were attempting to secure national accreditation from the United States Government. To meet government criteria the CCE passed measures for its associated schools to require incoming students to have completed at least two years of pre-chiropractic college, and revised their educational standards to meet the expectations of higher education.
On August 26, 1974 the United States Commissioner of Education officially listed the CCE as a "Nationally Recognized Accrediting Agency". This followed the support of the organization's accreditation petition by the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards. Once the CCE secured accreditation this allowed for eligibility for federal education and research grants, student eligibility for federal loans, and gave increased legitimacy for chiropractic as a profession overall. The accreditation of the CCE also allowed organizations such as the FCLB and American Chiropractic Association to put pressure on non-compliant schools to update their curriculums to match the national expectations of all chiropractic schools.

Koenigs–Knorr reaction

The Koenigs–Knorr reaction in organic chemistry is the substitution reaction of a glycosyl halide with an alcohol to give a glycoside. It is one of the oldest glycosylation reactions. It is named after Wilhelm Koenigs (1851–1906), a student of von Baeyer and fellow student with Hermann Emil Fischer, and Edward Knorr, a student of Koenigs.
In its original form, Koenigs and Knorr treated "acetobromoglucose" with alcohols in the presence of silver carbonate. Shortly afterwards Fischer and Armstrong reported very similar findings.
In the above example, the stereochemical outcome is determined by the presence of the neighboring group at C2 that lends anchimeric assistance, resulting in the formation of a 1,2-trans stereochemical arrangement. Esters (e.g. acetyl, benzoyl, pivalyl) generally provide good anchimeric assistance, whereas ethers (e.g. benzyl, methyl etc.) do not, leading to mixtures of stereoisomers.
Mechanism.
In the first step of the mechanism, the glycosyl bromide reacts with silver carbonate upon elimination of silver bromide and the silver carbonate anion to the oxocarbenium ion. From this structure a dioxolanium ring is formed, which is attacked by methanol via an mechanism at the carbonyl carbon atom. This attack leads to the inversion. After deprotonation of the intermediate oxonium, the product glycoside is formed.
The reaction can also be applied to carbohydrates with other protecting groups. In the oligosaccharide synthesis in place of the methanol other carbohydrates are used, which have been modified with protective groups in such a way that only one hydroxyl group is accessible. 
History.
The method was later transferred by Emil Fischer and Burckhardt Helferich to other chloro-substituted purines and produced thus for the first time synthetic nucleosides. It was later improved and modified by numerous chemists.
Alternative reactions.
Generally, the Koenigs–Knorr reaction refers to the use of glycosyl chlorides, bromides and more recently iodides as glycosyl donors. The Koenigs–Knorr reaction can be performed with alternative promoters such as various heavy metal salts including mercuric bromide/mercuric oxide, mercuric cyanide and silver triflate. When mercury salts are used, the reaction is normally called the Helferich method.
Other glycosidation methods are Fischer glycosidation, use of glycosyl acetates, thioglycosides, glycosyl trichloroacetimidates, glycosyl fluorides or n-pentenyl glycosides as glycosyl donors, or intramolecular aglycon delivery.

Controversies.
In October 2020, after the George Floyd protests, some volleyball players chose to wear "together we rise" t-shirts to a volleyball game against rival North Kansas City. They had seen the slogan at the Parkville 'March for Unity' over the summer, a protest in solidarity of the plight of people of color in the United States. The interim Principal, Dr. Kerrie Herren, "stormed" onto the court to command students to take off the shirts, arguing that students shouldn't wear shirts supporting the Ku Klux Klan to athletic activities.
In October 2021, a group of freshmen football players at Park Hill South High School started and circulated a Change.org petition to "Start slavery again" online through Snapchat. Many students disliked the response by the administration, citing a lack of transparency and response. Some students responsible for the petition were suspended; they later sued the school for First Amendment infringements.
Between November 2023 and March 2024, a Park Hill South substitute teacher, football coach, and former student—Dillon Thomas—allegedly had an inappropriate relationship with a female student over text. Thomas had allegedly solicited meetings off-campus and oral sex. For this, he was arrested and terminated from his position.

Valley Forge (play)

Valley Forge is a 1934 three-act historical play by Maxwell Anderson, about the winter that George Washington spent in Valley Forge. It has four settings, a large cast, and slow pacing. It concerns Washington's struggle to keep faith with his soldiers amidst intrigue from General Howe and the British Army in Philadelphia, and despite little support and outright treachery from the Continental Congress. Like the playwright's earlier historical dramas, "Elizabeth the Queen" and "Mary of Scotland", the play's action, though set in historical circumstances, is fictional.
The play was produced by the Theatre Guild and staged by Herbert Biberman and John Houseman. A minuet dance within the play was choreographed by Martha Graham, and had music arranged by Max Weiser. The settings were designed by Kate Drain Lawson and costumes by Carroll French. The original production starred Philip Merivale as George Washington. The play has had no Broadway revival, but was adapted for television on several occasions, starting in 1950.

Synopsis.
The play opens with the interior of a one-room bunkhouse in Valley Forge. A dozen ragged Continental soldiers call it home, but not for long. Hunger, illness, the cold and lack of supplies are driving them to drift away, back to their real homes. When General Washington comes by with the Marquis de Lafayette to inspect the encampment, the men tell him of their wants and fear that Congress will neither pay nor supply them. They need to go home to hunt food for their families. Washington, though he shares their concern about Congress, implores them to stay despite their sufferings. If you leave now, he tells them, there will be no revolution left when you return.
Meanwhile, at a ballroom in Philadelphia where British officers are being entertained by loyalist families, General Howe meets Mary Philipse, now Mistress Morris, who was once close to a young George Washington. Howe decides to propose negotiations to Washington, using Mary as initial go between. He has heard that France is close to signing a Treaty of Alliance with America, and is anxious to negotiate before Washington hears the news. At first reluctant, she agrees to visit Washington at his camp, bringing Howe's offer with her. The next evening Mary meets with Washington. Though a committed loyalist she is ambivalent about persuading him to meet with Howe. Later, Washington and his staff discuss the proposal and he decides to accept the offer to meet.
The next morning, the bunkhouse soldiers argue about General Conway. He has made disparaging remarks about Washington to other senior officers. Conway has also met with two representatives of Congress in the camp, from a group trying to surrender to the British in order to restore trade. Washington confronts Conway and drives the two representatives out of camp. But he is concerned to alleviate the sufferings of his soldiers, which he feels can only be done by holding the army together to negotiate from strength.
Washington meets with Howe in a barn on Hay Island in the Delaware River. Howe warns Washington that his own tenure as commander of British forces in North America is ending, and the next general sent out may well be harder to deal with. Washington is torn by doubt, but his soldiers and aides shout to him not to give in, that they want liberty more than food or clothing. Washington breaks off the negotiations and reassures his men that their joint cause will continue its struggle. He observes to his men that "This liberty will look easy by and by when nobody dies to get it."
Original production.
Background.
The first public notice of this play came with a newspaper article in late September 1934 stating the Theatre Guild was trying to decide whether "Valley Forge" or "Rain From Heaven" by S. N. Behrman would be the second production of their subscription season. By mid-October the Guild had decided to mount both plays, with Lawrence Langner and Theresa Helburn supervising production for "Valley Forge". At the same time the Guild signed an India-born Englishman named Philip Merivale to play George Washington.
Tryouts.
The first tryout was held at Pittsburgh's Nixon Theatre on November 19, 1934. Reviewer Kaspar Monahan said the opening night audience was largely composed of Guild subscribers, and that it was "warmly responsive" to the play. Monahan himself was enthusiastic about it, on both patriotic and dramatic grounds. He was most enthusiastic about the writing and Merivale's interpretation of Washington at this time as a man beset by doubts. He also appreciated the dramatic contrast afforded by the juxtaposition of the bunkhouse and ballroom scenes, and praised the acting of Stanley Ridges and Ruth Weston. Another local reviewer had read Anderson's manuscript before seeing the opening night performance; she said there was a major difference in that Anderson originally had Mary Philipse tell Washington about the coming French aid. The stage production removed this scene, strengthing the drama of Washington's eventual decision to not negotiate, at the expense of the Mary Philipse character, whose visit now seemed inconsequential.
The production went to the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., on November 26, 1934. The local critic called it a fine play, but remarked that "it still breathes of dress rehearsal days". They found the character played by Margalo Gilmore a "strange interlude" that took the viewer away from Valley Forge. The settings lacked both "bold grandness" and "surefire frowsiness", "and if it was cold at Valley Forge than we escaped it."
Originally scheduled to hit Broadway on December 3, 1934, the production instead made a last minute detour to Ford's Theatre in Baltimore for another week's tryout. A booking change on such short notice was highly unusual for a Broadway-bound production, and made possible only by the Theatre Guild's ownership of the Manhattan venue. The Baltimore reviewer praised the playwright for presenting a human Washington rather than a legend, but noted of the storyline "there are times when it seems less like a plot than a discussion". He found the Act III dying declaiming of a consumptive soldier "as false as the sounds of skirmishing supposedly going on outside."
Premiere and reception.
"Valley Forge" premiered at the Guild Theatre on December 10, 1934. Critical reaction was positive, but nuanced with a general sense the play was neither the equal of Anderson's previous efforts nor quite up to the usual Guild production standards. Brooks Atkinson thought the scene where Mary Philipse meets Washington "runs perilously close to theatrical solemnity" but was saved by the "craggy candor of Mr. Merivale's acting." He also thought the settings undistinguished: "the traditional Theater Guild magic is wanting here", but was impressed with the caliber of acting. Burns Mantle was one of several reviewers whose patriotism colored their assessment of the play's merits: "There are some... who will get few thrills from "Valley Forge", and I think I pity them a little. Their ancestral roots are not struck deep in American soil...". He also felt the production values were "skimpier than usual", but praised the acting of Philip Merivale, Stanley Ridges, Margalo Gilmore, and Victor Kilian.
Rowland Field wrote that "Valley Forge" "is a magnificent analysis of the character of a great man", complimented the playwright and all the leading performers, but spent most of the space recounting the story as if he were writing a history rather than a review. Arthur Pollock was impressed with the writing of Maxwell Anderson's play: "It is articulate as lightning and made eloquent by liquid language that is often liquid fire." However, he thought it too lovely for the time and place: "They are a little sound-drunk, these ragamuffins, the emaciated warriors of Valley Forge." Pollock judged Philip Merivale a fine performer but sometimes felt his delivery ambiguous; was the character weighing his words or the actor trying to remember them?
Closing.
"Valley Forge" closed at the Guild Theatre on January 26, 1935. According to Burns Mantle, the play was successful and still making money, but the Guild wanted Philip Merivale, Margalo Gilmore, and Stanley Ridges to join Helen Hayes in a tour for "Mary of Scotland", which would provide greater financial returns.
Adaptations.
Radio.
On January 3, 1935, while the original production was still running, Philip Merivale performed an extract from it on Rudy Vallee's radio show over the WEAF chain.

Eucalyptus globoidea

Eucalyptus globoidea, commonly known as the white stringybark, is a tree that is endemic to near-coastal areas of south-eastern Australia. It has rough, stringy bark, often furrowed on the trunk, glossy, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, often curved leaves, oval to spindle-shaped green to yellowish flower buds, white flowers and small, more or less spherical to hemispherical fruit.
Description.
"Eucalyptus globoidea" is a tree that grows to a height of with rough bark to the thinnest branches. The bark is grey to reddish brown and stringy, often furrowed on the trunk. The leaves on young trees are glossy green, a lighter shade on the lower side, egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped long, wide and wavy. Adult leaves are egg-shaped to lance-shaped, often curved, glossy green on both sides, long and wide. The flowers are arranged in groups of mostly between eleven and fifteen on an angular or flattened peduncle long, individual flowers on a cylindrical pedicel up to long. The mature buds are green to yellowish, oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide. The operculum is cone-shaped and about as long and wide as the flower cup. The stamens are white. Flowering occurs from July to February but mostly from September to January. The fruit is a globe-shaped to hemispherical capsule, long and wide.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Eucalyptus globoidea" was first formally described in 1927 by William Blakely who published the description in "Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales". The specific epithet ("globoidea") is derived from the Latin word "globoideus" meaning "globoid", referring to the shape of the fruit.
Distribution and habitat.
White stringbark grows in forest and woodland on hills and slopes on the coast and nearby tablelands, south from Woolgoolga in New South Wales to near Melbourne in Victoria.
Globoidnan A is a lignan found in "E. globoidea". This molecule has been found to inhibit the action of HIV integrase, an enzyme which is responsible for the introduction of HIV viral RNA into a host's cellular DNA.

No. 63 Squadron RAF

Number 63 Squadron was a bomber aircraft and training squadron of the Royal Air Force that was active during various periods from 1916 to 1992. Originally using De Havilland DH.4 aircraft in World War I, it was last equipped with BAe Hawk jet trainers.
History.
First World War.
No. 63 Squadron was formed on 31 August 1916 at Stirling, Scotland as a squadron of the Royal Flying Corps. The squadron was intended to operate as a day-bomber unit over the Western Front in France, and was equipped with de Havilland DH.4 aircraft; however at the last minute the squadron was re-tasked to operate against the Turkish army in Mesopotamia (Iraq) and was re-equipped with R.E.8's for its new mission, when the squadron arrived in the Middle East in August 1917. No. 63 Squadron remained in Mesopotamia for the rest of the war, and it was disbanded on 29 February 1920.
Inter-war.
In February 1937 the squadron was refounded at Andover, Hampshire as a bomber unit, and three months later became the first unit to receive the Fairey Battle aircraft. Early in 1939 the unit was assigned an aircrew training role, and received a number of Avro Ansons, but the unit lost its separate identity in April 1940 when it became a part of No. 12 OTU.
Second World War.
On 15 June 1942 No. 63 Squadron was reformed from part of No. 239 Squadron at RAF Gatwick, West Sussex with Alison engined North American Mustang I's. In January 1944 the squadron moved to RAF Turnhouse in Scotland and was re-equipped with Hawker Hurricane IV's in April 1944, converting to Supermarine Spitfire VB's in early May 1944. By the end of May the squadron was based at RNAS Lee-on-Solent, preparing for D-Day. During the allied landings 63 Squadron flew spotter flights above the Royal Navy, providing a form of Forward Air Control (FAC) for the naval gunners supporting the troops on land. The pilots of the squadron at this stage were drawn from former Army co-operation units, The Royal Marines and as well as the RAF. On 20 September 1944 the squadron relocated to RAF North Weald. The squadron was disbanded on 1 February 1945.
Post-war: enter the jets.
On 1 September 1946, No. 164 Squadron was renumbered as No. 63 Squadron, operating Spitfires from RAF Middle Wallop. Subsequently they moved to RAF Thorney Island, and shortly after in April 1948, the squadron was re-equipped with Gloster Meteor jet fighters. The squadron moved again, this time to RAF Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, in May 1950. After re-equipping with Hawker Hunter fighters in 1956, the squadron was disbanded again on 31 October 1958.
63 Squadron reformed as a 'Shadow' unit for the Day Fighter Combat Squadron of the Central Fighter Establishment from 30 November 1958 until 1 June 1963. On the same day the number was transferred to No. 229 Operational Conversion Unit. based at RAF Chivenor, North Devon, as the 'Shadow' designation for one of its constituent squadrons. On 2 September 1970 No. 229 OCU was re-designated as the Tactical Weapons Unit and 63 squadron remained one of its 'Shadow' units. 63 squadron was transferred to No 2 TWU at RAF Chivenor, initially operating Hawker Hunter aircraft, and later, the BAE Hawk and when that unit was redesignated No 7 FTS on 1 April 1992, 63 Squadron remained a component part until 23 September 1992; when 63 Squadron last disbanded and its role was transferred to No. 19 (Reserve) Squadron.

The Other Sister

The Other Sister is a 1999 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Garry Marshall and stars Juliette Lewis, Giovanni Ribisi, Diane Keaton and Tom Skerritt. The film was written by Marshall and Bob Brunner. Malia Scotch Marmo did uncredited rewrites to the script.
Plot.
After receiving a well-earned certification from a sheltered boarding school, Carla Tate, an ambitious young woman with a mild intellectual disability, returns home to her overprotective and slightly snobby mother Elizabeth. Elizabeth seems to behave as if she is embarrassed about her youngest daughter's disability. During family discussions, Elizabeth adopts an uneasy attitude because her daughter was bullied as a child. Carla's father Radley is a dentist and recovering alcoholic. Carla's ambition is to seek more independence from her family by earning a diploma from a polytechnic school. When Carla meets Danny McMahon, another student who also has a developmental disability, they become friends and soon fall in love. Envying Danny's freedom, Carla convinces her parents she is capable of living on her own and moves into her own apartment. After a time, Carla and Danny become sexually active together.
Danny's independence is financially compromised when his wealthy and emotionally detached father abruptly stops sending subsistence money due to Danny flunking his classes. Danny begins to realize that the independence he enjoyed comes with a staggering cost. Danny gets drunk, then seeks solace and insight (and a joyride in a vintage Ford Mustang convertible) from his landlord and friend, Ernie.
During a Christmas party at the country club, nervous about his personal lot, Danny drinks too much to build up his courage to declare his love for Carla. He also tells everyone about their first time making love. A humiliated Carla bursts into tears, screaming at everyone to stop laughing at her. Although Danny did not intend to embarrass Carla, she nonetheless refuses to see him anymore. Over time, Carla realizes she still loves Danny and wants to see him again despite her mother's advising her otherwise. At her older sister Caroline's wedding, Danny surprises Carla by showing up at the church and asks her to marry him, in a scene mimicking "The Graduate", the couple's favorite film, to which she accepts.
Everyone supports their wishes except Elizabeth, who is unsure Danny can take care of himself, let alone Carla. Carla angrily tells her mother that she is sick of her combination of three behaviors: dominance, negativity and doubt. Also, Carla is sick of her mother constantly treating her like two things at once: an embarrassment and a handicap. Radley and her sisters, Heather and Caroline, support her decision, and the wedding is planned. At first, Elizabeth is determined not to attend, but Radley admonishes her. He said that he will walk Carla down the aisle. Finally, after realizing how selfish she has been behaving, Elizabeth relents. Outside the church, Danny surprises Carla with their school's marching band playing "76 Trombones" from "The Music Man", and they are chauffeured away to their honeymoon in Ernie's prized Mustang.
Production.
In January 1996, it was announced Garry Marshall would direct "The Other Sister", the story of a "semi-retarded teenager who moves into an apartment of her own and falls in love with a semi-retarded classmate", for Disney. In August 1997, it was announced Diane Keaton would play Elizabeth Tate. The following month, it was reported that Juliette Lewis was cast as Carla Tate opposite Keaton.
Soundtrack.
"The Other Sister: Music from the Motion Picture" was released on February 23, 1999. The lead song for the soundtrack was "The Animal Song" by Savage Garden. The music video for the song featured scenes from the film. It peaked at #109 on the "Billboard" 200 albums chart.
Track listing.
All track information and credits were taken from the CD liner notes.
Release.
Box office.
"The Other Sister" opened at #3 at the North American box office making $6.6 million in its opening weekend behind "Payback" and "8mm", which opened at the top spot. It ultimately grossed $27.8 million in the United States and Canada, failing to recoup its $35 million budget, becoming a box office bomb.
Critical reception.
The film received negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film maintains a 29% rating, based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The site's consensus: "Made-for-tv drama evokes anything but real emotion." Metacritic reports a 28 out of 100 rating, based on 21 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".
Roger Ebert rated the film at one out of four possible stars, and said the film was "shameless in its use of mental retardation as a gimmick, a prop and a plot device."
Accolades.

ClubONE Riviera

ClubONE Riviera (), formerly called Star Seafood Restaurant (), and earlier called Treasure Floating Restaurant (), is a restaurant in Sha Tin, Hong Kong. The restaurant was built with granite taking on the shape of a ship berthing along the shore. The building is situated at the eastern shore of Shing Mun River, near the junction of Siu Lek Yuen Road and Tai Chung Kiu Road. It served Cantonese dim sum and seafood.
As of 2007, the restaurant was the largest dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong, with 150 tables seating 12 people each.
The restaurant closed in early 2018 and reopened as 'Club One' in summer 2018.
History.
The current building was a replacement for the former Shatin Floating Restaurant that had opened in 1963 and which was later towed to Guangzhou in 1984. The relocation was mandated by the relevant government departments for several reasons. Firstly, the land that the restaurant used as a car park was allocated to the Amateur Rowing Association. Secondly, the pollution discharged by the restaurant clashed with plans to build a town park along the river, in concert with the ongoing development of Sha Tin New Town. Lastly the Shatin Lands Office stated that the construction of an underwater sewage pipe in the Shing Mun River would hamper the large vessel's ability to manoeuvre out of the channel in the future.
In its 21 years in Hong Kong, the first restaurant operated in eight locations, including the area in front of a mansion called Windermere (also called Ho Tung Lau), Sai Lam Temple, Lek Yuen, and the current site of the Sha Tin Jockey Club Swimming Pool.
In 1986 the Lands Department offered the site, near the anchorage of the old floating restaurant, for tender. It was intended from the beginning to resemble a true floating restaurant but sit on piles, as the Shatin Lands Office stated that a restaurant vessel could no longer be operated on the Shing Mun River. The office also stated that the restaurant would not pollute the river as it would have a proper sewer connection.
The restaurant, lit up at night and reflected in the still water of the Shing Mun River, has long been a local landmark of Shatin. A 1992 review in the "South China Morning Post" described it as "a hulking concrete pile that sits firmly in Sha Tin's river like a barge designed by Hollywood showmen Louis B. Mayer and Sam Goldwyn on a drunken dare [...] so electrically dazzling its sheer candle power could light the way into Kai Tak. Gaudy beyond belief, the main dining rooms' crystal chandeliers are worthy of Versailles, and the stone sculptures and pagoda towers could easily sink an ocean liner."

Siege of Dimdim

The siege of Dimdim was an operation orchestrated by the Safavid ruler Shah Abbas I (), in which his forces besieged the Dimdim Castle of the rebellious Kurdish Emirate of Bradost from November 1609 to the summer of 1610. The siege was led by the grand vizier Hatem Beg Ordubadi, who captured the castle and massacred its garrison.
Background.
Throughout the 17th-century, Safavid shahs (kings) of Iran opted to use harsh measures against the uncooperative Kurdish tribes in the western part of the country. Shah Abbas I () had to decide whether to crack down on Kurdish parties that were in a semi-subordinate position or to maintain a reasonable equilibrium between the Kurds and Turkmens. In the case of Amir Khan Lepzerin, the ruler of the Emirate of Bradost, who constructed the Dimdim Castle close to the western part of the Lake Urmia and rebelled against the Safavids, Shah Abbas I chose the first course of action.
Yılmaz Brothers alliance.
There are well documented historical accounts of a long siege from 1609 to 1610 between Kurds and the Safavids. The Kurds were at a disadvantage numerically and technologically. After a siege lasting almost a year, the Safavid Grand Vizier Hatem Beg Ordubadi captured the fort and massacred the Kurdish garrison.
Aftermath.
After a long and bloody siege led by the Safavid grand vizier Hatem Beg, which lasted from November 1609 to the summer of 1610, Dimdim was captured. All the defenders were killed. Shah Abbas I ordered a general massacre in Bradost and Mukriyan (reported by Iskandar Beg Turkoman, Safavid Historian in the Book "Alam Aray-e Abbasi") and resettled the Afshar tribe in the region while deporting many Kurdish tribes to Khorasan region. Shortly after the execution of Bodagh Soltan, the Mokri governor of Maragheh, Abbas married Bodagh’s reputable sister in 1610. No issue is recorded from this marriage. Although Safavid historians (like Iskandar Beg ) depicted the first siege of Dimdim as a result of Kurdish mutiny or treason, in Kurdish oral traditions (Beytî Dimdim), literary works (Dzhalilov, pp. 67–72), and histories, it was treated as a struggle of the Kurdish people against foreign domination. The first literary account of this siege is written by Faqi Tayran.

R v Hall

R v Hall, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 309, 2002 SCC 64 is a leading case decided by the Supreme Court of Canada on the right not to be denied bail without just cause under section 11(e) of the "Charter".
Background.
David Scott Hall was charged with the murder of a woman in a high-profile case. He applied for bail pending trial. The judge denied the application—not for reasons of ensuring appearance in court or protecting the public—but in order "to maintain confidence in the administration of justice". Paragraph 515(10)(c) of the Criminal Code allows the denial of bail for this reason.
Hall appealed the decision on the basis that section 515(10)(c) violated the right "not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause" under section 11(e) of the "Charter".
Opinion of the Court.
The Court held that the portion of section 515(10)(c) permitting detention "on any other just cause being shown”" was unconstitutional as it gave too much discretion to the judge to deny bail without just cause. The violation could not be upheld under section 1 due to proportionality.
The Court however upheld the portion of section 515(10)(c), which allows the denial of bail "to maintain confidence in the administration of justice" as it was a valid and just reason to deny bail. The standard is based on the view that the reasonable member of the community would be satisfied that the denial of bail would be necessary to maintain confidence in the system.

No. 66 Squadron RAF

No. 66 Squadron was a Royal Flying Corps and eventually Royal Air Force aircraft squadron.
History.
World War I.
The squadron was first formed at RAF Filton, Bristol, on 30 June 1916 as a training squadron equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory BE2, BE12s and the Avro 504. The squadron received its first Sopwith Pup on 3 February 1917, and deployed to Vert Galant aerodrome (between Talmas and Beauval) in the Somme département, France on 12 March 1917. The Pups were exchanged for Sopwith Camels during October 1917 and the squadron moved to join No. 14 Wing on the Italian front.
During twelve months of fighting in Italy the squadron destroyed 172 enemy aircraft. On 13 March 1918 Lieutenant Alan Jerrard engaged nineteen enemy aircraft on his own; he managed to destroy three before he was forced to land and taken prisoner. He was awarded the squadron's only Victoria Cross for his efforts.
At the end of the war the squadron stayed on in Italy for a few months, returning to the United Kingdom in March 1919 and was disbanded on 25 October 1919.

Second World War.
The squadron was reformed on 20 July 1936 from 'C' Flight, No. 19 Squadron RAF at RAF Duxford, initially being equipped with Gloster Gauntlets, before a slow conversion to Supermarine Spitfires from August 1938. The squadron was part of No. 12 Group RAF in Fighter Command and was on readiness from the start of the war in September 1939. The first contact with the enemy was an attack on a Heinkel He 111 of the Norfolk coast near Cromer, the German aircraft subsequently crashed in Denmark. The squadron moved to RAF Horsham St. Faith after Germany's invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands, the squadron destroyed its first enemy aircraft on 12 May 1940 over the Hague. At the end of August the squadron moved to the south of England as part of the Battle of Britain, it operated from RAF Kenley, RAF Gravesend, RAF West Malling and by November to RAF Biggin Hill. By the time the Germans had stopped daylight bombing the squadron had destroyed 20 aircraft with another 17 probables and also damaged another fifteen.
It conducted the first of the Rhubarb operations on 20 December 1940, with two Spitfires over Le Touquet.
On the 24th of February 1941 the squadron moved to RAF Exeter, before moving again in April to RAF Perranporth in Cornwall to operate fighter sweep missions over the Channel. It moved to Portreath in December 1941 and re-equipped with the Spitfire V. In April 1942 the squadron moved to RAF Ibsley and was involved in the support for the combined operations at Dieppe. By October 1942 the squadron was based at RAF Zeals in Wiltshire. It moved to RAF Sumburgh in the Shetland Isles in April 1943 to provide fighter cover for the British fleet based at Scapa Flow before returning to the West Country, firstly at RAF Church Stanton in Somerset and then back to Perranporth in Cornwall in October 1943.
In November 1943 the squadron moved to RAF Hornchurch and converted to the Spitfire IX and then moved to North Weald airfield in Essex at the end of February 1944. The squadron became part of the Second Tactical Air Force and provided air cover for the invasion forces in Normandy, being based in France from 22 June. After a break in South Wales the squadron continued to support the advancing allied forces being based at Abbeville in September 1944 and then on to Grimbergen in Belgium. In November the squadron converted to the Spitfire XVI before moving the Twente in the Netherlands where it disbanded on 30 April 1945.
Post-war.
The squadron was reformed at Duxford on 1 September 1946, by renumbering No. 165 Squadron RAF, initially flying Spitfires. The following year, the squadron converted to Meteors, which it flew for six years before re-equipping with Canadair Sabres. At RAF Linton-on-Ouse in March 1956 it acquired Hawker Hunters, which it flew before being disbanded again on 30 September 1960 at RAF Acklington.
On helicopters.
The squadron reformed at RAF Odiham on 15 September 1961, from the Belvedere Trials Unit equipped with Bristol Belvedere helicopters. In June 1962 it left the UK for Seletar in Singapore, where it provided heavy lift helicopter support for forces operating in Malaya. The squadron finally disbanded on 17 March 1969.

No. 72 Squadron RAF

Number 72 (Fighter) Squadron of the Royal Air Force is a training squadron that is currently based at RAF Valley using the Beechcraft Texan T1 to deliver Basic Fast Jet Training (BFJT). 
No. 72 Squadron started life in 1917 supporting the British Army during World War I on operations in the Middle East, being disbanded in 1919. It was reformed in 1937, initially with Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters, moving on to fly Supermarine Spitfires during the Battle of Britain. For the remainder of World War II it served in a variety of theatres, ending up disbanded in Austria in 1946.
Reformed again in 1947, it was equipped with de Havilland Vampire jet fighters, moving on to the Gloster Meteor, and then the Gloster Javelin, flying these until 1961.
After the jets, it moved to RAF Odiham and from 1961 until 1 April 2002 the squadron flew helicopters in the transport role. In 2002 it assumed its current role as a training unit, initially based at RAF Linton-on-Ouse using the Short Tucano T.1, before moving to RAF Valley and the Texan trainer.
The squadron nickname, "Basutoland", is derived from the fact that during both world wars, the Basutoland Protectorate, now Lesotho, donated aircraft to RAF, which were assigned to No. 72 Squadron.
History.
First World War.
No. 72 Squadron was formed on 28 June 1917 at Upavon as a squadron of the Royal Flying Corps. On Christmas Day, the squadron left for the Middle East and regrouped at Basra on 2 March. Here, they split in three flights, each assisting the Army in their various missions, and were disbanded in Baghdad on 22 September 1919.
Second World War.
No. 72 Squadron was reformed at RAF Tangmere on 22 February 1937 from 'B' flight of No. 1 Squadron, initially equipped with the Gloster Gladiators that came across from No. 1 Squadron. In 1939, these were replaced by Supermarine Spitfires, which were used for air defence and convoy protection duties following the start of World War II. Then, in May 1940, the squadron moved to RAF Gravesend to provide air cover for Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Dunkirk.
At the start of the Battle of Britain, No. 72 Squadron was in the North of England at RAF Acklington as part of No. 13 Group, before moving south to RAF Biggin Hill during September to aid the main defence force. The squadron was then moved to North Africa to support the Tunisian campaign before being supplied with the updated Spitfire Mk.IX in 1942. They then assisted the British 8th Army as they advanced through Italy and France up until the German surrender. At this point they were moved to Austria. It was here they were disbanded on 30 December 1946 at Zeltweg.
Post-War jets.
The squadron was reformed on 1 February 1947 at RAF Odiham by renumbering No. 130 Squadron. They took over No. 130 Squadron's de Havilland Vampire F.1s, making no haste to remove that units 'AP' code. The Vampire soldiered on for three versions until it gave way to the Gloster Meteor F.8 in 1952, and when the squadron was given a night-fighter role in February 1956 these were replaced with Meteor NF.12s and Meteor NF.14s. In April 1959, the squadron got the all-weather fighter role and was given Gloster Javelin FAW.4s and later Javelin FAW.5s. These were flown until the squadron was disbanded at RAF Leconfield on 30 June 1961.
Helicopters.
On 15 November 1961, No. 72 Squadron was reformed at RAF Odiham, but now as a helicopter unit. They were equipped with twin-rotor Bristol Belvederes HC.1s until the Westland Wessex HC.2 replaced these aircraft in August 1964. For the next thirty-eight years they continued to use these aircraft and in that time the squadron saw action in Malaya, provided post-disaster assistance following the "Torrey Canyon" tanker disaster in 1967 and supported the security forces in Northern Ireland from 1969. During the mid 1970s the squadron also operated a SAR 'D' flight at RAF Manston. From January 1997 the Wessex was partly supplanted with the more modern Westland Puma HC.1. The squadron's Wessex HC.2s departed RAF Aldergrove on 25 March 2002, shortly before their retirement. No. 72 Squadron was then disbanded on 1 April 2002 at Aldergrove.
Training – Tucano to Texan.
On 12 July 2002, No. 1 Flying Training School divided its strength between two new reserve squadrons – No. 72 (Reserve) Squadron and No. 207 (Reserve) Squadron, with both units operating the Short Tucano T.1 at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire. No. 72 (Reserve) Squadron became No. 72 Squadron after the (Reserve) suffix was rescinded across the RAF on 1 February 2018. The final Tucano Basic Fast-jet Training (BFJT) course graduated on 25 October 2019, which was marked with a nine-ship flypast over the local area. No. 72 Squadron disbanded on 31 October 2019.
On 28 November 2019, the squadron stood-up at RAF Valley operating the Beechcraft Texan T.1.
On 13 November 2020, No. 72 Squadron became No. 72 (Fighter) Squadron to reflect its former role as a fighter unit.

23 Years

23 Years: A Study of the Prophetic Career of Mohammad is a biographical book on the life of Muhammad written by Iranian author and scholar Ali Dashti. Although completed in 1973, the book was published anonymously in Beirut, Lebanon in 1974. The book is considered banned in Iran. 
Following the Iranian Revolution (1979), Dashti, then in his mid‑eighties, was arrested, imprisoned, and sentenced to death by Islamic Revolutionary Court for writing this critical work on Islam.
The book contains criticism of the Quran:
Although Dashti concludes his criticism with an affirmation of the Quran's eloquenceIn all fairness the Qur’an is a wonder. Its short suras of the Meccan period are charged with expressive force and persuasive power. Its style has no precedent in the Arabic language. Its effusion from the tongue of an illiterate man with no education, let alone literary training, is a phenomenon which, in this respect, can justifiably be described as a miracle.Dashti cites many devout Muslim thinkers that thought the Quran's eloquence was not what made it inimitable:Among the Moslem scholars of the early period, before bigotry and hyperbole prevailed, were some such as Ebrahim on- Nazzam who openly acknowledged that the arrangement and syntax of the Qur’an are not miraculous and that work of equal or greater value could be produced by other God-fearing persons. 
He then argued that the Qur’an is miraculous because it predicted the future, not in the oracular way of the fortune-tellers but with correct prescience of events which actually occurred... The views on the Qur’an held by Ebrahim on-Nazzam have already been mentioned, and it must be added that they were not his alone, but were also held by other scholars of the Mo'tazelite school such as Hesham b. Amr ol-Fuwati (d. ca. 218/833) and Abbad b. Solayman (d. ca. 250/864) [and more]. All were devout believers. They saw no inconsistency between their views and sincere faith.
Publication.
The first part of "23 Years" was serialized in issue 47 of Kaveh magazine, published in Munich in 1973. At the author’s request, his name was not mentioned, but in that article Javad Vahabzadeh introduced the work and provided clues that allowed readers to identify the author as Ali Dashti. The serialization continued through issue 58 (June 1975), after which the book was published independently in Lebanon. The work was later translated into English by F. R. C. Begley. According to Houshang Moinzadeh, discussions about the book’s content were held at Ali Dashti’s home, and Dashti sought assistance from Alinaqi Monzavi, an Islamic scholar and writer who had fled Iran for Beirut for political reasons. The book circulated widely and became a major factor in the difficulties Dashti faced during the last decade of his life. According to journalist Masʿud Behnoud, Dashti, then aged 80, was sentenced to death by the Islamic Revolutionary Court for authoring "23 Years". After the Iranian Revolution, others, including Monzavi, were also imprisoned partly in connection with this book.
Contents.
In "23 Years", Ali Dashti presents a rationalist interpretation of Islamic prophecy and offers one of the most critical analyses of Muhammad’s life and message. According to Dashti, Muhammad’s experience of revelation was the voice of his own conscience rather than a supernatural event, and his prophetic mission can be explained through modern psychology and sociology. Dashti rejects the doctrine of Muhammad’s infallibility and accepts accounts such as the so‑called “Satanic Verses” episode. He argues that the Quran should be regarded as the book of Muhammad rather than the word of God, noting what he describes as grammatical flaws and diverse sources, which he considers expected from an illiterate man. For Dashti, the Quran’s significance lies in its impact rather than in any literary miracle, comparing its untranslatable style to the poetry of Hafez. Dashti places blame on Arab culture for what he sees as many of Islam’s problems, particularly those associated with contemporary Arab Islamism. He writes that the Arabs retained materialism, resistance to abstract thought, and rebelliousness after adopting Islam. He regards organized religion as a force that often weakens reason, though he argues there is no inherent reason it must do so. Dashti maintains that if Muhammad is understood as fully human, then his actions can be seen as responses to psychological and social conditions rather than divine directives. He asserts that Muhammad sometimes acted according to expediency rather than spiritual or moral principles, and that certain rulings and rituals from his time, such as aspects of the Hajj, have become irrelevant in the modern era. On Muhammad’s multiple marriages and their references in the Quran, Dashti writes that “every reader of the Quran should be amazed to encounter these personal matters in the scripture and the code of ethics that is valid for all humanity at all times.”
Dashti is a strong critic of writers who interpret events in Muhammad’s life and the Quran through miracles. Instead, he emphasizes the psychological and sociological factors that, in his view, shaped Muhammad’s effort to establish a complex religion and a state. Dashti argues that the Quran originated from Muhammad’s own creative genius rather than divine revelation. While he does not deny the existence of God, he contends that God is too transcendent to be concerned with the Prophet’s personal affairs, including those of his wives, companions, and enemies. Dashti portrays Muhammad as a man with both virtues and weaknesses, subject to strong emotions and human limitations, yet generally worthy of reverence and superior to his contemporaries. "23 Years" treats the Prophet with respect and even seeks to honor him, though Dashti criticizes the growth of myths and miraculous accounts surrounding Muhammad over the centuries. He also rejects many Western misconceptions about Muhammad, particularly those from the Middle Ages.
The book is organized into several main sections:
Criticism.
Since the publication of "23 Years", a number of rebuttals have appeared, including "Betrayal in the Report of History" by Seyyed Mostafa Hosseini Tabataba’i and "The Great Secret of the Prophethood" by Ja‘far Sobhani. Both authors raise objections to Dashti’s arguments and accuse him of misquoting and misrepresenting sources. Tabataba’i in particular criticizes Dashti for lacking a basic knowledge of Arabic, questioning how someone unfamiliar with the language could comment on the Quran. As an example, he cites Dashti’s interpretation of a verse from Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26:198), arguing that Dashti’s translation is misleading. Tabataba’i’s rebuttal is noted for its harsh tone and personal attacks, which, according to researcher Paul Sparkman, reflect elements of religious fanaticism in Iran at the time. Sparkman also observes that "23 Years" contains typographical errors and minor inaccuracies that, while not central to Dashti’s thesis, have been used by critics such as Tabataba’i to challenge Dashti’s credibility. Sparkman further acknowledges that Dashti did not always provide precise citations for commentators, historians, and hadiths, even though the work remains a serious and scholarly effort.
By questioning why the capacity for evil exists in human nature, Dashti challenges the need for a divine messenger. He notes that theologians claim God did not create evil, but that humans possess a nature capable of both good and evil. Dashti asks: “Who gave these people this nature in which there is the possibility of both evil and good?” He argues that a person’s character is fixed at birth and unaffected by individual will, stating that “black people cannot be whitened by preaching,” and concludes that prophecy is therefore unnecessary.
Tabataba’i argues that Dashti contradicts himself elsewhere in "23 Years". For example, Dashti writes: “The miracle of Muhammad is that he did not sit idly by and resisted all the insults and persecutions, and did not turn away from any plan to impose Islam on the Arabian Peninsula, to bring the different tribes of the Arabs under one brigade, who are completely alien to supernatural affairs and who turn to the senses according to their primitive nature and have no other goal than to gain immediate benefit, except to encroach on the wishes of others. It is not made of them.”
In his review of "23 Years", Jay Norder attributes the book’s popularity and repeated reproduction to the controversy it provoked. He describes the work as a direct attempt to demythologize the prophethood of Muhammad and to return to early historical sources such as Ibn Ishaq and "Tarikh al‑Tabari". Norder considers Dashti well qualified to produce such a study because of his seminary background and strong command of the Arabic language.
According to Brigitte Hoffmann, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Bamberg, "23 Years" is a well‑researched and readable book. She notes that although it has been widely circulated in Iran, from a scholarly perspective it does not offer any new interpretation of Muhammad’s life.
In an article published in "Journal of the Middle East" in 1987, Hamed Elgar observed that Dashti’s approach in "23 Years" was to reduce the Prophet to one of many great historical figures. Elgar points out that Dashti even compares the Prophet to Lenin, suggesting that Lenin was “more sour” (p. 8). Elgar writes that Dashti interprets the spread of Islam as “a response to the social conditions of Mecca” (p. 195). According to Elgar, Dashti reduces the narrative of Muhammad and his companions to a story of “violence and greed, or unrest and confusion.” Elgar also argues that the book’s tone recalls older Orientalist narratives and includes sharp racial generalizations, portraying Arabs, both before and after Islam, as “wild and unintelligent” (p. 195).
Ahmad Sadri has described "23 Years" as a work containing insults toward sacred beliefs and unjust accusations against the Prophet of Islam. He interprets the limited questioning and release of Dashti after the book’s publication as evidence of some tolerance for rational critique of Islam among Muslims. By contrast, Saʿidi Sirjani reported that Dashti suffered severe mistreatment in prison, claiming that he was tortured and even sustained a pelvic injury while incarcerated.

Henrietta Marie

 
The Henrietta Marie was a slave ship that carried captive Africans to the West Indies, where they were sold as slaves. The ship wrecked at the southern tip of Florida on its way home to England, and is one of only a few wrecks of slave ships that have been identified.
History.
The "Henrietta Marie" carried a crew of about eighteen men. It was probably built in France sometime in the 17th century. The ship came into English possession late in the 17th century, possibly as a war prize during the War of the Grand Alliance. It was put to use in the Atlantic slave trade, making at least two voyages carrying Africans to slavery in the West Indies. On its first voyage, in 1697–1698, the ship carried more than 200 people from Africa that were sold as slaves in Barbados. The ship was owned by a consortium of investors, including Thomas Starke, "an experienced slave trader who was part owner of several other slaving vessels and owned five tobacco plantations in Virginia,
In 1699 the "Henrietta Marie" sailed from England on the first leg of the triangular trade route with a load of trade goods, including iron and copper bars, pewter utensils, glass beads, cloth and brandy. The ship sailed under license from the Royal African Company (which held a monopoly on English trade with Africa), in exchange for ten percent of the profits of the voyage. It is known to have traded for African captives at New Calabar on the Guinea Coast. The ship then sailed on the second leg of its voyage, from Africa to the West Indies, and in May 1700 landed 191 Africans for sale in Port Royal, Jamaica. The "Henrietta Marie" then loaded a cargo of sugar, cotton, dyewoods and ginger to take back to England on the third leg of the triangular route. After leaving Port Royal the ship headed for the Yucatán Channel to pass around the western end of Cuba (thus avoiding the pirates infesting the passage between Cuba and Hispaniola) and catch the Gulf Stream, the preferred route for all ships leaving the Caribbean to return to Europe. The "Henrietta Marie" wrecked on New Ground Reef near the Marquesas Keys, approximately west of Key West. There were no survivors, and the fate of the ship remained unknown for almost three centuries.
Discovery and salvage.
The wreck was found in 1972 during a magnetometer survey by a boat operated by a subsidiary of Mel Fisher's Treasure Salvors, Inc. (Fisher's company was searching for the "Nuestra Señora de Atocha" and other ships of the 1622 Spanish treasure fleet that had wrecked along the Florida Keys in a hurricane.) Two anchors and a cannon were found on the first visit. The wreck was visited again in 1973. Some artifacts were collected from the wreck, including bilboes, iron shackles that were used to restrain slaves. When they realized that the wreck was likely a slave ship, not a treasure ship, the company reburied the artifacts and pieces of the ship's hull that they had exposed and left the site. In 1983 through 1985 Henry Taylor, sub-contracting with Mel Fisher's company, excavated the wreck (known as the "English wreck") with the assistance of archaeologist David Moore. The wreck was identified when a bronze ship's bell carrying the inscription "The Henrietta Marie 1699" was found at the wreck site. Survey and excavation of the wreck site has continued at intervals.
The "Henrietta Marie" wreck has yielded more than 7000 objects (and more than 30,000 glass beads), the largest collection of artifacts known from a slave ship. They have contributed greatly to our understanding of slave ships and the slave trade. Parts making up more than 80 bilboes have been found at the wreck site. As bilboes were typically used to shackle pairs of slaves together, the ones found at the wreck site could have restrained more than 160 slaves. Other items found at the wreck site include trade goods apparently left over from trading for captives in Africa, goods acquired in Africa in addition to captives (including an elephant tusk), and gear belonging to the ship and crew. Part of the hull of the ship, including much of the keel and part of the stern post, have survived, and have been measured and reburied at the site.
Two copper cauldrons found at the wreck site shed light on the diet of the crew and slaves on a voyage. Malcom argues that the cauldrons were used to prepare separate meals for the crew and the slaves. One cauldron had a single chamber in capacity. This vessel was probably used to prepare a sort of mush or gruel for the slaves. As there were no slaves on the ship at the time it wrecked, the cauldron had been used to store chain. The second cauldron was smaller and had two chambers. One chamber had a capacity of , and the second a capacity of . This vessel could have been used to cook a two-course meal for the crew.
Legacy.
In May 1993, the National Association of Black Scuba Divers placed a memorial plaque on the site of the "Henrietta Marie". The plaque faces the African shore thousands of miles away, and has the name of the slave ship and reads, “In memory and recognition of the courage, pain and suffering of enslaved African people. Speak her name and gently touch the souls of our ancestors." Dr. Colin Palmer stated, "the story ends in 1700 for this particular ship, but the story of what the ship represented continues today," he says. "The importance of the "Henrietta Marie" is that she is an essential part of recovering the black experience - symbolically, metaphorically and in reality".
A 1995 documentary, "Slave Ship: The Testimony of the Henrietta Marie", was narrated by Cornel West.
The vessel was also featured on the History Channel's "Deep Sea Detectives".
An exhibition, "A Slave Ship Speaks: the Wreck of the "Henrietta Marie"", was created by the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum in 1995, and toured museums around the United States for more than a decade. A new exhibition, including a great number of artifacts from the "Henrietta Marie" will be touring North America, starting in 2019. The name of the exhibition is "Spirits of the Passage". 
In November 2024, the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum opened a new exhibit about the transatlantic slave trade and its connections with the Florida Keys, centered on artifacts from the "Henrietta Marie" along with materials sourced elsewhere.
The Mel Fisher Maritime Museum has also launched the Florida Slave Trade Center. A database and online exhibition featuring all of the artifacts from this ship wreck and a descriptive online exhibition and including other artifacts and documents from the museum's slave trade collection.

ThermaCare

ThermaCare is a brand name of a disposable heating pad made by Angelini. 
The brand was first introduced in 2001 by Procter &amp; Gamble. P&amp;G sold the Thermacare brand to Wyeth in 2008 and merged with Pfizer in 2009. Another merger occurred between Pfizer's and GlaxoSmithKline's consumer healthcare divisions, and the brand was sold to the Italian pharmaceutical company Angelini in 2021.
Application.
ThermaCare is a type of Continuous Low-level Heat-wrap Therapy (CLHT), that activates upon contact with air, providing approximately eight hours of heat directly where the heat-wrap is applied. Thermacare heat-wraps are designed for specific applications, including neck or wrist pain, lower back pain, knee pain, and menstrual cramps. Continuous Low-level Heat-wrap Therapy (CLHT) has been shown to provide better results than cold therapy in the early treatment and prevention of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) - muscle soreness that occurs within 1 to 2 days of physical exertion.
In a low back pain study conducted at the U.S. Spine &amp; Sport Foundation in San Diego, California in 2006, participants treated with Continuous Low-level Heat-wrap Therapy (CLHT) prior to exercise reported less intense pain and less trouble moving after 24 hours than the control group. Study participants treated with the heat-wraps also showed greater (138%) pain relief than those who received standard cold pack treatment, according to the study's research director, John Mayer, Ph.D. The study concluded that heat-wraps were effective in the early treatment and prevention of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) - soreness that occurs within 1-2 days of physical exertion.
Thermacare heat-wraps have been studied in 13 randomized controlled clinical trials for muscle pain relief efficacy. When applied to the lower back muscles, it provided greater pain relief for 24 hours after application when compared to ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and no treatment. When the same product was applied to the wrist, it decreased pain and improved range of motion (ROM) in patients experiencing wrist pain.
Mechanism.
It was developed in 1997 as a portable heat wrap for the treatment of back pain that didn't use counter-irritants such as menthol or capsaicin. It's designed as a cloth wrap that houses several small disks made of iron powder, activated charcoal, sodium chloride, and water. When the wrap is removed from its sealed pouch and exposed to oxygen, the disks oxidize in an exothermic reaction. This mechanism allows portable heat wraps to maintain their heat for the entire 90-minute application, compared to conventional silicate-gel hot packs that start to lose heat at 15–20 minutes. Similar to silicate-gel hot packs, the average temperature increase of the paraspinal muscles is 2.2°C, at 1.5cm depth and 1.1°C at 2cm.

No. 245 Squadron RAF

No. 245 Squadron was a squadron of the Royal Air Force. It flew as an anti-submarine squadron during World War I and as a fighter squadron during World War II. After the war it was first a jet-fighter squadron and its last role was as a radar-calibration unit.
History.
World War I.
No. 245 Squadron was formed on 20 August 1918 from No. 426 and No. 427 Flight at Fishguard. It flew Short 184 on anti-submarine patrols over the southern Irish Sea. The squadron disbanded on 19 May 1919.
World War II.
As No. 245 (Northern Rhodesian) Squadron, the squadron was reformed at RAF Leconfield on 30 October 1939 equipped with Bristol Blenheim light bombers, and from January 1940, Fairey Battle light bombers. Both of these types were replaced by Hurricanes in March 1940 and in May it moved to RAF Drem in Scotland. However, during the Dunkirk evacuation it operated a detachment from RAF Hawkinge, but in July it was transferred to RAF Aldergrove in Northern Ireland, where it remained throughout the Battle of Britain on defensive duties. In July 1941 it moved to RAF Ballyhalbert and remained there until September 1941, when it returned to England and began offensive sweeps. On 19 August 1942, the squadron took part in a preparatory attack as part of the Dieppe Raid. Ten aircraft took off at 0445 from RAF Shoreham. Three aircraft failed to return, and of the remaining seven, only one was serviceable. In January 1943 it moved to Scotland again, where it began converting to Typhoons, taking these back down south in March to RAF Westhampnett. The squadron was then allocated to the 2nd Tactical Air Force on its formation in June 1943 and soon began attacking enemy lines of communication and other suitable targets in preparation for Operation Overlord. From April it began using rocket projectiles and on 27 June 1944, it moved onto the continent, from where it continued to support the Allied advance through France, the Low Countries and into Germany. The squadron disbanded at Schleswig in Germany on 10 August 1945.
Postwar.
That same 10 August 1945 at RAF Colerne, No. 504 Squadron RAF was re-numbered as No. 245 to form part of the RAF's first jet fighter equipped wing. It was equipped with Hawker Hunters when disbanded at RAF Stradishall on 3 June 1957. On 21 August 1958 No. 527 Squadron RAF was renumbered at RAF Watton as No 245 squadron. It was now employed on radar calibration duties with Canberra B.2s, moving to RAF Tangmere on 25 August 1958 and remained there until it was disbanded by being renumbered to No. 98 Squadron RAF on 18 April 1963.

No. 247 Squadron RAF

No. 247 Squadron was formerly a squadron of the Royal Air Force. It was also known as No. 247 (China British) Squadron in recognition of the donations made by the British communities of the foreign concessions established on the Chinese coast. The financial gift to provide two fighter squadrons also included the badge in the form of a scroll with Chinese characters "Cheu Feng" meaning "fierce wind" or Hurricane, and the motto "Rise from the East". The squadron was heavily involved in air operations during the Second World War, and the defence of the United Kingdom during the early years of the Cold War.
History.
Formation and early history (1918–1919).
No. 247 Squadron was first formed in the First World War on 20 August 1918 by the amalgamation of No. 336 and 337 Flights of the Royal Naval Air Service. The squadron was equipped with Felixstowe F2A flying boats and its role was reconnaissance and anti-submarine work in the North Sea. With the cessation of hostilities, the squadron was disbanded on 22 January 1919.
The Second World War.
Formed from the Shetland Fighter Flight No. 247 Squadron was reformed at Roborough (Plymouth) on 1 August 1940, flying Gloster Gladiator biplanes. Tasked with the defence of the south west of England including the ports of Plymouth and Falmouth, the squadron's first action came on 25 September 1940, when a force of 24 Dornier Do 17s escorted by 12 Messerschmitt Bf 110s flew over the English Channel from France and crossed the coast at Start Point, heading towards Plymouth. Four of the squadron's Gladiators attempted an attack, but the formation was eventually broken up by Hurricanes from Exeter. Two Dorniers managed to reach the target, and bombs fell into the harbour. Too fast for the Gladiators to get into position, the raiders made their escape. The Luftwaffe's tactics changed to night bombing of Britain during the autumn of 1940, and the Gladiators adopted a night defence role. Although several visual night interceptions were made (aided by ground control radar), the obsolete Gladiator had no success against the heavy bombing of the city of Plymouth.
No. 247 Squadron was re-equipped with the Hawker Hurricane on 24 December 1940, and continued to operate by day and night. Due to the poor airfield conditions a detachment was sent to RAF St Eval with its better facilities. Even though the Hurricane was an improvement over the Gladiator, results in night interception were poor and the squadron made little impact in defending Plymouth and Exeter during the Blitz. After a short move to RAF Portreath, the squadron moved to RAF Predannack on 18 June 1941. It was from there on 7 July that the squadron's first 'kill' was made when a Junkers Ju 88 was shot down during a night raid on Falmouth. Various methods were adopted to improve the night fighting capability, including operating in formation with Turbinlite aircraft of 1457 Flight. This bizarre concept consisted of a high powered searchlight attached to the nose of a radar fitted Douglas Havoc, with the intention of illuminating the target, to enable the Hurricane to make its attack. There are no known instances of this being a success. The Hurricane was also tried with radar equipment, but soon heavier, improved performance machines like the Bristol Beaufighter replaced the aircraft in the night-fighting role. From September 1942 until after the war, the unit was stationed at RAF High Ercall in Shropshire, where the local parish church has a Roll of Honour to squadron members who died in the war.
As well as continuing its night defence role the squadron was involved in early offensive "intruder" attacks against Luftwaffe aerodromes in northern France. When the Hawker Typhoon replaced the Hurricane, these types of operations continued in daylight. No. 247 was involved in attacks prior to and including D-Day. Targets included transport systems, and weapon emplacements as well as providing close air support to ground forces. On 27 June 1944, the squadron moved to Coulombs in Normandy, beginning the subsequent drive through France, Belgium, the Netherlands and into Germany. Augmented memoirs of one of the squadron armourers for this period are recorded in Nash (2010).
Post war.
After the war, the squadron was re-equipped briefly with the Typhoon's successor, the Hawker Tempest. However the radical change of equipment came in March 1946 when the squadron became the first unit to operate the de Havilland Vampire jet fighter. No.247 Squadron formed part of the UK's air defence during the early Cold War years. The Vampire was replaced by the improved version of the Gloster Meteor, and then the successful Hawker Hunter fighter.
Missile defence.
Defence cuts and a change of strategy for the RAF in the late 1950s led to the squadron's second disbandment in 1957. In 1960, the squadron reformed as a Bristol Bloodhound surface-to-air missile unit, before being disbanded for the final time on 31 December 1963.
Post RAF.
The squadron number since it final disbandment from the RAF was adopted by the Air Training Corps and is currently based in Ashton-under-Lyne.
Squadron association.
An association of former serving members of the squadron was formed in 1987 and continues to the present day. An annual reunion is held, normally in September.

List of Minnesota Vikings team records

The Minnesota Vikings is an American football franchise based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The team was established in 1961 and is part of the National Football League's NFC North division. Since then, the team has taken part in the NFL playoffs 31 times, reaching four Super Bowls in 1970, 1974, 1975 and 1977.
This list encompasses the major records set by the team, its coaches and its players. The players section of this page lists the individual records for passing, rushing and receiving, as well as selected defensive records. The team has had three full-time home stadiums since its establishment – Metropolitan Stadium, Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, and U.S. Bank Stadium; attendance records, both home and away, are included on this page.
All-time series.
The Vikings have played against every other team in the NFL at least five times each in the regular season. They have a winning record against 20 teams, a losing record against 10 and an even record against one: the Cincinnati Bengals, whom they have played 14 times, winning seven each. The Vikings' best record is against the Houston Texans – they have won each of the six meetings between the two teams – and their worst record is against the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts, whom they have beaten eight times in 26 meetings for a win percentage of .327. Their fewest wins against a specific franchise is three, in seven meetings with the Baltimore Ravens (.429). The Vikings have recorded the most wins in their history against the Detroit Lions (80), as well as the most points (2,690). The Vikings have conceded the most points to the Green Bay Packers (2,802), who are also the team against whom they have suffered the most losses (63) and ties (3).
In the postseason, the Vikings have faced 18 different opponents, but they only have a win percentage of .500 or higher against six of them. The Vikings' best postseason win percentage is against the Arizona Cardinals and the Cleveland Browns, whom they have beaten every time they have met – the Cardinals twice and the Browns once; meanwhile, they have faced eight teams without recording a single win, the worst being against the Philadelphia Eagles, whom they have met four times without winning. The Vikings have recorded their most postseason wins against the Los Angeles Rams, whom they have beaten five times in seven meetings, and their most losses against the San Francisco 49ers, to whom they have lost five times in six meetings. The Vikings have also conceded their most postseason points against the 49ers (181), and scored their most against the New Orleans Saints (161). As well as meeting the Rams seven times in the postseason, the Vikings have also met the Dallas Cowboys seven times, recording three wins and four losses.

LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans

The Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans is a public university focused on the health sciences and located in New Orleans, Louisiana. It is part of the LSU System and is the home of six schools (including one of two LSU medical schools), 12 centers of excellence, and two patient care clinics. Due to Hurricane Katrina, the School of Dentistry was temporarily located in Baton Rouge but has since returned to its campus in New Orleans. As a public university, it mostly accepts residents of the state of Louisiana with the exception of combined M.D./Ph.D. students and also children of alumni.
History.
The LSU Health Sciences Center School of Medicine was founded in 1931 commissioned by Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr. It facility was originally located at 1542 Tulane Avenue, adjacent to the then-rebuilt Charity Hospital, which was completed in 1939.
Governor Long considered himself the "founder" of the LSU School of Medicine, having written in his autobiography, "Every Man a King": "There had been completed the magnificent structure for that school in the midst of the buildings of the Charity Hospital of New Orleans. That new school, upon examination, was found to have been supplied with every modern device or contrivance suggested and recommended by the national medical organizations. It was given 'A' rating by the American Medical Association before it had been in operation more than eighteen months."The School of Graduate Studies was established in 1965, followed by the School of Dentistry in 1966, the School of Nursing in 1968, and the School of Allied Health Professions in 1970. The School of Public Health followed in 2003.
In the immediate wake of Hurricane Katrina, LSUHSC-NO suffered drastically lowered capacity at its two teaching hospitals, Charity Hospital and University Hospital. LSUHSC-NO went 15 months without the use of either facility, and was forced to set up a trauma center in a vacant shopping center. University Hospital was extensively renovated before reopening on November 20, 2006. The fate of Charity Hospital was a more controversial issue. Grassroots efforts to restore the Charity Hospital building failed when it was deemed by an arbitration panel to be more than 50% damaged.
In 2011, state and LSU officials broke ground on a $1.1 billion teaching hospital in the lower mid-city area of New Orleans. On August 1, 2015, University Medical Center New Orleans opened as a state-of-the-art academic medical center for medical, dental and allied health education in addition to bioscience research. The new facility is one of the anchors of New Orleans' biomedical research corridor.

No. 222 Squadron RAF

No. 222 Squadron was a Royal Air Force fighter squadron.
History.
In the First World War.
The squadron was formally formed at Thasos on 1 April 1918 from "A" Squadron of the former No. 2 Wing, RNAS when the Royal Air Force was formed. At this time, Richard Peirse became Officer Commanding 222 Squadron. Later, on 6 April 1918, former "Z" Squadron of No. 2 Wing, RNAS was added to the strength. Renumbered No. 62 Wing and consisting of Nos. 478, 479 and 480 Flights, the squadron was given the task of maintaining raids on Turkish targets in Macedonia and Thrace, operating from islands in the Northern Aegean, officially adopting the 222 Squadron number plate on 14 September 1918. The squadron continued to carry out raids on Turkish targets in the Balkans until the end of the war, eventually disbanding on 27 February 1919.
In the Second World War.
On 5 October 1939 No. 222 Squadron was reformed at RAF Duxford flying Bristol Blenheim IF's in the shipping protection role, but in March of the following year it re-equipped with Supermarine Spitfires and became a day-fighter unit. It fought during the Battle of Britain, being based at RAF Hornchurch on 15 September 1940, under Squadron Leader "Johnnie" Hill. It later took part in Operation Jubilee, the 1942 Dieppe raid. In December 1944 the squadron converted to Hawker Tempests, which it flew until the squadron was recalled to the UK to re-equip with Gloster Meteors.
Entering the jet age.
From October 1945 the squadron flew various marks of Meteors for nine years and later, after December 1954 Hawker Hunters, being part of Scotland's defence, but on 1 November 1957 No. 222 was disbanded.
On Rockets.
In its last incarnation on 1 May 1960, No. 222 became a Bristol Bloodhound SAM unit at RAF Woodhall Spa, but after four years service in this role it disbanded on 30 June 1964.

No. 257 Squadron RAF

No. 257 Squadron RAF was a flying squadron of the Royal Air Force active during the First World War, the Second World War and also the Cold War. It was finally disbanded in December 1963.
History.
In World War I.
No. 257 Squadron was formed at Dundee on 18 August 1918 from Nos. 318 and 319 Flights. It flew both seaplanes and flying boats on anti-submarine patrols from Dundee until the end of the First World War and disbanded there on 30 June 1919.
In World War II.
The squadron was re-formed on 17 May 1940 at RAF Hendon as a Fighter Squadron, equipped with Supermarine Spitfires. It became operational at RAF Northolt, where the squadron flew Hawker Hurricanes in the Battle of Britain, during which it was part of No. 11 Group RAF. The squadron was based in south-east England throughout the Battle of Britain and in March began taking part in sweeps over France. Night fighter patrols were also flown and in July 1942 converted to Hawker Typhoons which began low-level patrols in September to intercept enemy fighter-bomber raids. Escort missions were also flown and in July 1943, it began offensive operations. The squadron started fighter-bombing sorties in January 1944, and as part of the Second Tactical Air Force moved to France in July to provide air support for the Allied armies. By October it was based in Belgium for attacks on enemy transport and battlefield targets. The squadron disbanded on 5 March 1945.
During the Second World War the squadron was the Burma gift squadron; the chinthe (a lion) in its logo is a Burmese effigy.
Post War.
On 1 September 1946 the squadron was re-formed at RAF Church Fenton as a fighter squadron, flying Gloster Meteors until January 1955. It then converted to Hawker Hunters. On 31 March 1957 the squadron was disbanded for the third time.
On 28 June 1949, two Meteors from the squadron - operating out of RAF Finningley to participate in a nine-day NATO operation called 'Exercise Foil', designed to test Britain's air defences - collided. Both pilots ejected. One was Flying officer A H Turner; the second Warrant Officer Levene. One aircraft crashed at Hatfield Moor, Lindholme, near Doncaster, and the second on a country estate near Retford called Serlby Park. A third Meteor, flown by F/O Hawes, also force-landed at Finningley due to undercarriage failure returning from the same mission to intercept 'enemy' USAF Boeing B-29 Superfortresses over the North Sea. There were no ground casualties.
On Bloodhounds.
The squadron re-emerged on 1 July 1960 at RAF Warboys in Cambridgeshire as an air defence unit using Bristol Bloodhound missiles till 31 December 1963, when the squadron was disbanded for the fourth, and final time.

No. 504 Squadron RAuxAF

No. 504 (County of Nottingham) Squadron was one of the Special Reserve Squadrons of the Auxiliary Air Force, and today is a reserve force of the RAF Regiment. It was integrated into the AAF proper in 1936. Based at RAF Cottesmore, Rutland, 504 Squadron used a variety of light bombers before being re-tasked to fighters with the Hawker Hurricane in 1939. It subsequently became a Fighter Squadron. Currently No. 504 Squadron no longer has a flying role, but as part of No 85 Expeditionary Logistics Wing of the RAF A4 Force.
History.
Formation and early years.
No. 504 squadron was formed on 26 March 1928 at RAF Hucknall, Nottinghamshire as a Special Reserve Squadron in the day bomber role. As such it flew first with Hawker Horsleys, later with Westland Wallaces and Hawker Hinds. In the meantime, on 18 May 1936, the squadron had gone over to the Auxiliary Air Force and the next change for the squadron came on 31 October 1938, when it was transferred from RAF Bomber Command to RAF Fighter Command. After a short spell with Gloster Gauntlet biplane fighters the squadron received its first really modern aircraft as their next aircraft were to be Hawker Hurricane fighters.
In World War II.
On 26 August 1939 the squadron was mobilised for active service as part of RAF Fighter Command and the Squadron was transferred to RAF Digby. In 1940 Squadron Leader ”Johnnie” Hill took command whilst the squadron was at Lille, France. When the airfield was overrun Hill had taken 12 Hurricanes into the air. Hill was shot down and shot at first by French peasants, and later by a British Army major who believed him to be a fifth columnist. On recovering from his injuries Hill was given command of 222 Squadron.
Throughout the Second World War, 504 Sqn operated from over some thirty airfields in both the UK and abroad. Roles were as diverse as Heavy Bomber escort; interdiction raids across occupied France; escort duties over Arnhem during Operation Market Garden and major involvement in the Battle of Britain. In March 1945 the Squadron was re-equipped with Gloster Meteor jets, but the war in Europe ended before they saw any action. It was re-numbered No. 245 Squadron on 10 August 1945.
Into the jet age.
The Squadron was reformed at RAF Syerston on 10 May 1946 as a light bomber squadron. It was initially equipped with Mosquito T.3 training aircraft but in April 1947 it was re-designated a night fighter unit, receiving Mosquito NF.30s. Its role was changed once more again in May 1948, now to that of a day fighter unit. For this it received Spitfire F.22s, flying these until October 1949, when Meteor F.4s began to arrive to replace them. These were in their turn replaced by Meteor F.8s in March 1952. The squadron standard was presented on 3 March 1957 by Air Chief Marshal Sir Francis Fogarty, GBE, KCB, DFC, AFC and then laid up in St Mary's Church, Wymeswold, RAF Wymeswold having been the Squadron's last operational base. Seven days later the squadron, along with all other 19 flying units of the since 1947 Royal Auxiliary Air Force, disbanded.
Notable squadron members.
Flight Lieutenant W.B. Royce of 504 Squadron became the first AAF pilot to be awarded the DFC, Sergeant Ray Holmes of 504 Squadron was forced to ram a Dornier bomber intent on attacking Buckingham Palace when his guns jammed during the attack. This event was immortalised in the film "Battle of Britain". Famous rugby player and Russian prince Alexander Obolensky flew with 504 Squadron, dying in accident on 29 March 1940. It had many international pilots too, including Emile Jayawardena from Ceylon. Sergeant Pilot, later Squadron Leader, C. 'Wag' Haw, flew with 504 during the Battle of Britain before moving to 81 Sqn for deployment to Russia in August 1941 where he was awarded the Order of Lenin.
Current role.
On 1 January 1998, the Offensive Support Role Support Squadron (OSRSS) was formed at RAF Cottesmore. This was then renamed 504 Squadron on 1 October 1999. On 1 October 2000 the reformation was celebrated with a march past in Nottingham.
Although 504 Squadron no longer had a flying role, it remained an important part of the RAF. 
As part of an Operational Support Squadron (OSS), the first role of 504 Squadron was Force Protection (FP). To this end, approximately 60% of the personnel were RAF Regiment gunners providing ground defence for all assets on deployed operations. The remaining personnel were responsible for the many other duties including: Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) warning and reporting, airbase shelter marshalling and general sentry duties. Elements of the squadron deployed operationally to Afghanistan in these roles. During 2014, the squadron re-roled from FP to Logistics. As part of the RAF's No. 85 Expeditionary Logistics Wing (85 ELW) the Squadron is now based at RAF Wittering in Cambridgeshire and is recruiting personnel to train as Chefs, Drivers and Suppliers in support of deployed RAF units worldwide.

Staten Island light rail

Staten Island light rail proposals refer to two projects in the New York City borough of Staten Island. These proposals are among the several light rail projects that have been floated in New York City in recent years. Neither proposal was funded in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 2015–2019 Capital Plan, but $4 million was allocated to a study for it.
North Shore.
The North Shore Light Rail line is a proposed long light rail line (since turned into a bus rapid transit line) serving the northern portion of Staten Island along the abandoned right of way of the former Staten Island Railway's North Shore Branch. According to PlanNYC.org, which is affiliated with the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, "[t]he proposed five mile route, which would connect Arlington and the St. George Ferry Terminal, would cost $360 million, with funding coming from federal, state and local agencies. In order to move forward, the project will require a $4 million allocation from Congress for a feasibility study which is currently awaiting approval from the House Transportation Committee. A projection of 11,000–15,000 daily passengers would ride on the North Shore Light Rail if and when it is complete. This line would serve the North Shore.
An option that was considered was light rail transit, due to its ability to operate with cars in mixed traffic. There was a plan to run the line down South Avenue from the Arlington station to the Teleport. The line would rise to street level at Arlington. Due to freight trains laying up as far west as Union Avenue, the line would have to be physically separate from the freight line or the cars would have to be built to a higher crash standard. Comments included begin raising the line at Union Avenue, since it would have to go to street level anyway, to avoid interference with the freight line.
Some advocates of improved mass transit on the island oppose the plan, however, preferring instead the option of through service between Arlington and Tottenville via the existing Staten Island Railway, this made possible by the installation of the Ball Park loop in 2001 (since discontinued but still intact).
A 2012 alternatives analysis identified bus rapid transit (Select Bus Service) rather than light rail as the preferred alternative for the region. The bus service was eventually selected. About $356 million is needed to complete the line, which will run on the North Shore Branch right-of-way, adjacent to the Kill van Kull. $5 million was allocated in the 2015–2019 Capital Program for environmental and design work. In July 2018, the MTA indicated that it was retaining a consultant to advise on an environmental impact assessment for the bus rapid transit line on the North Shore Branch for $4.8 million. On May 8, 2019, the MTA held an open house on an updated version of the North Shore Alternatives Analysis study. The two alternatives from the study are being evaluated alongside other potential transit expansion and improvement projects in the city as part of the 2025-2044 Twenty-Year Needs Assessment, which is planned to be completed by October 1, 2023.
West Shore and Kill van Kull.
The West Shore Light Rail is another proposed light rail project, which is long, and is being championed by the Staten Island Economic Development Corporation (SIEDC). Beginning at the South Shore, probably near a park-and-ride in Pleasant Plains, the proposed line would run along New York State Route 440, according to an alignment decision in March 2009. It would cross over the Bayonne Bridge to connect to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail (HBLR) in Bayonne, New Jersey.
Construction of this line could begin as soon as 2018, and serve the new Freshkills Park, but SIEDC needs $5 million in funding to complete studies for the route of the line; a campaign to raise the $5 million failed previously, but was restarted in August 2014. The line would serve 9,000 more Staten Island workers, 65,000 more Staten Island residents, and 25,000 more households. As part of the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, $4 million has been allocated for the alternative analysis of light rail on the West Shore of Staten Island.
The first public open house was held on September 25, 2019. It was announced that four modes (Heavy Rail, Bus Rapid Transit, Light Rail, Select Bus Service) and three north-south corridors (Korean War Veterans Parkway and Richmond Avenue, West Shore Expressway, West Shore Expressway and Victory Boulevrd) would be considered. 18 specific route alignments were considered.
For the West Shore Expressway option, eight alternatives were considered:
For the West Shore Expressway and Victory Boulevard option, four alternatives were considered:
For the Korean War Veterans Parkway and Richmond Avenue option, six alternatives were considered:
Alternatives from this long list were screened out based on whether they crossed multiple bridges, complimented other transit lines, served jobs and residents along the West Shore, and if right-of-way was available. Accordingly, options with two crossings off Staten Island were eliminated due to complexity of implementation, and the West Shore Expressway/Victory Boulevard corridor was dropped due to right-of-way constraints. All options were dropped for the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. Six options were kept under consideration for the recommended long list of alternatives. Bayonne Bridge or Goethals Bridge to Tottenville were kept for all modes via the West Shore Expressway, the two bus options were kept for St. George to Tottenville or the Outerbridge Crossing via the West Shore Expressway, and all but heavy rail were kept for Bayonne Bridge or Goethals Bridge to Totttenville via Korean War Veterans Parkway and Richmond Avenue.
At community board briefings in January 2020, it was announced that this list was reduced to two alternative, after additional screening factors were considered. These included whether they were supported by existing and planned land use, complimented North Shore BRT, and whether longer-term improvements could be implemented in phases. The two selected build options were both for BRT, and would not preclude their future conversion to light rail.
The first option would run between Newark Airport or St. George and Tottenville via the West Shore Expressway. Nine stops were proposed: Arthur Kill SIR station, Sharrots Road, Bloomingdale Road, Huguenot Avenue/Arthur Kill Road, Victory Boulevard, South Avenue, Bloomfield Avenue, Old Place/Western Avenue, and Newark Liberty International Airport. There would be a dedicated right-of-way in the highway's median between Arthur Kill station and Old Place and Western Avenue, with service in mixed traffic via the Goethals Bridge and the New Jersey Turnpike to AirTrain P1 Parking Lot. Some buses would diverge at South Avenue onto the North Shore BRT to St. George.
The second option would run between Tottenville and Bayonne via Korean War Veterans Parkway and Richmond Avenue. Thirteen stops were proposed: Arthur Kill SIR Station, Foster Road, Huguenot Avenue, Arden Avenue, Annadale Road, Eltingville Transit Center, Staten Island Mall, Travis Avenue, Victory Boulevard, College of Staten Island, Forest Avenue, Elm Park (Walker Street), and 8th Street HBLR Station. The service would run in mixed traffic from Bayonne and across the Bayonne Bridge, and would run in a dedicated right-of-way between Elm Park station and Arthur Kill via Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway, Richmond Avenue, and the Korean War Veteran Parkway. 
In March 2020, the MTA was expected to select its preferred alternative by the end of April, and the project did not have funding for its environmental impact study. However, in Spring 2020, the MTA announced that all planning studies, including the West Shore Alternative Analysis, would be put on hold due to financial issues resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2022, after the SIEDC urged the MTA to release the study's results, an MTA spokesperson said public outreach for the study was expected to resume in the following weeks. The two alternatives from the study are being evaluated alongside other potential transit expansion and improvement projects in the city as part of the 2025-2044 Twenty-Year Needs Assessment, which is planned to be completed by October 1, 2023.
Kill van Kull transit.
In September 2007, bus service was introduced between Richmond Avenue in Staten Island and the 34th Street HBLR station. , weekday peak limited stop service from Staten Island terminates at 34th Street with a connection to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail to Exchange Place.
The Bayonne Bridge was originally built to accommodate two extra lanes that could be used for light rail service. In 2019 the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey completed its project to raise the roadbed of the bridge by , in order to provide the clearance required by the newer post-Panamax container ships to pass under it. While not having begun any studies, New Jersey Transit was investigating the feasibility of extending HBLR from the 8th Street Station across the raised bridge. It is not clear whether such a system would fall under the supervision of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, although this is likely. Completing any such extension would involve a collaboration between New Jersey Transit, New York State, and New York City. The development of a Staten Island light rail system which could connect with the HBLR system has gained political support in New York. US Senator Robert Menendez supported the HBLR extension conceptually, but questioned the benefit for New Jersey.
Another proposal for transit over the Kill van Kull is an aerial gondola connecting Bayonne and the North Shore.

Shear band

In solid mechanics, a shear band (or, more generally, a strain localization) is a narrow zone of intense strain due to shearing, usually of plastic nature, developing during severe deformation of ductile materials.
As an example, a soil (overconsolidated silty-clay) specimen is shown in Fig. 1, after an axialsymmetric compression test. Initially the sample was cylindrical in shape and, since symmetry was tried to be preserved during the test, the cylindrical shape was maintained for a while during the test and the deformation was homogeneous, but at extreme loading two X-shaped shear bands had formed and the subsequent deformation was strongly localized (see also the sketch on the right of Fig. 1).
Materials in which shear bands are observed.
Although not observable in brittle materials (for instance glass at room temperature), shear bands or, more generally, ‘localized deformations’ usually develop within a broad range of ductile materials (alloys, metals, granular materials, plastics, polymers, and soils) and even in quasi-brittle materials (concrete, ice, rock, and some ceramics).
The relevance of the shear banding phenomena is that they precede failure, since extreme deformations occurring within shear bands lead to intense damage and fracture. Therefore, the formation of shear bands is the key to the understanding of failure in ductile materials, a research topic of great importance for the design of new materials and for the exploiting of existing materials in extreme conditions. As a consequence, localization of deformation has been the focus of an intense research activity since the middle of the 20th century.
Mathematical modeling.
Shear band formation is an example of a material instability, corresponding to an abrupt loss of homogeneity of deformation occurring in a solid sample subject to a loading path compatible with continued uniform deformation. In this sense, it may be interpreted as a deformation mechanism ‘alternative’ to a trivial one and therefore a bifurcation or loss of uniqueness of a ‘perfect’ equilibrium path. The distinctive character of this bifurcation is that it may occur even in an infinite body (or under the extreme constraint of smooth contact with a rigid constraint).
Consider an infinite body made up of a nonlinear material, quasi-statically deformed in a way that stress and strain may remain homogeneous. The incremental response of this nonlinear material is assumed for simplicity linear, so that it can be expressed as a relation between a stress increment formula_1 and a strain increment formula_2, through a fourth-order constitutive tensor formula_3 as
where the fourth-order constitutive tensor formula_4 depends on the current state, i.e. the current stress, the current strain and, possibly, other constitutive parameters (for instance, hardening variables for metals, or density for granular materials).
Conditions are sought for the emergence of a surface of discontinuity (of unit normal vector formula_5) in the incremental stress and strain. These conditions are identified with the conditions for the occurrence of localization of deformation. In particular, incremental equilibrium requires that the incremental tractions (not the stresses!) remain continuous
(where + and - denote the two sides of the surface) and geometrical compatibility imposes a strain compatibility restriction on the form of incremental strain:
where the symbol formula_6 denotes tensor product and formula_7 is a vector defining the deformation discontinuity mode (orthogonal to formula_5 for incompressible materials). A substitution of the incremental constitutive law (1) and of the strain compatibility () into the continuity of incremental tractions () yields the necessary condition for strain localization:
Since the second-order tensor formula_9 defined for every vector formula_10 as
formula_11
is the so-called 'acoustic tensor', defining the condition of propagation of acceleration waves, we can conclude that the condition for strain localization coincides with the condition of singularity (propagation at null speed) of an acceleration wave. This condition represents the so-called 'loss of ellipticity' of the differential equations governing the rate equilibrium.
State-of-the-art.
The state-of-the-art of the research on shear bands is that the phenomenon is well understood from the theoretical and experimental point of view and available constitutive models give nice qualitative predictions, although quantitative predictions are often poor. Moreover, great progresses have been made on numerical simulations, so that shear band nucleation and propagation in relatively complex situations can be traced numerically with finite element models, although still at the cost of a great computational effort. Of further interest are simulations that reveal the crystallographic orientation dependence of shear banding in single crystal and polycrystals. These simulations show that certain orientations are much more prone to undergo shear localization than others.
Shear banding and crystallographic texture.
Most polycrystalline metals and alloys usually deform via shear caused by dislocations, twins, and / or shear bands. This leads to pronounced plastic anisotropy at the grain scale and to preferred grain orientation distributions, i.e. crystallographic textures. Cold rolling textures of most face centered cubic metals and alloys for instance range between two types, i.e. the brass-type texture and the copper-type texture. The stacking fault energy plays an important role for the prevailing mechanisms of plastic deformation and the resultant textures. For aluminum and other fcc materials with high SFE, dislocation glide is the main mechanism during cold rolling and the {112}&lt;111&gt; (copper) and {123}&lt;634&gt; (S) texture components (copper-type textures) are developed. In contrast, in Cu–30 wt.% Zn (alpha-brass) and related metals and alloys with low SFE, mechanical twinning and shear banding occur together with dislocation glide as main deformation carriers, particularly at large plastic deformations. The resulting rolling textures are characterized by the {011}&lt;211&gt; (brass) and {01 1}&lt;100&gt; (Goss) texture components (brass-type texture). In either case non-crystallographic shear banding plays an essential role for the specific type of deformation texture evolved.
A perturbative approach to analyze shear band emergence.
Closed-form solutions disclosing the shear band emergence can be obtained through the perturbative approach, consisting in the superimposition of a perturbation field upon an unperturbed deformed state.
In particular, an infinite, incompressible, nonlinear elastic material, homogeneously deformed under the plane strain condition can be perturbed through superposition of concentrated forces or by the presence of cracks or rigid line inclusions.
It has been shown that, when the unperturbed state is taken close to the localization condition (4), the perturbed fields self-arrange in the form of localized fields, taking extreme values in the neighbourhood of the introduced perturbation and focussed along the shear bands directions. In particular, in the case of cracks and rigid line inclusions such shear bands emerge from the linear inclusion tips.
Within the perturbative approach, an incremental model for a shear band of finite length has been introduced prescribing the following conditions along its surface:
Employing this model, the following main features of shear banding have been demonstrated:

Velocita Wireless

Velocita Wireless is a national wireless-telecommunications service provider that is based in Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States. Known by several names over the years, Velocita Wireless has been in existence for over 17 years as the operator of the Mobitex network in the United States. Previously known as Cingular Interactive, L.P., BellSouth Wireless Data and prior to that RAM Mobile Data, Velocita Wireless carved a market for itself with the acquisition of the Mobitex network from Cingular and rebranding itself overall as Velocita in 2004.
History.
In 2001, the company's Mobitex network proved to be effective in communications in Manhattan during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Most other cellular and wireless telecommunications services were knocked-out or overloaded in New York City. The effectiveness of the network led to Velocita developing a small 'following' amongst emergency responders in the United States.
In 2006, Velocita Wireless became a strategic buyout for the Sprint Nextel Corporation.
Based in the Commonwealth of Virginia, Sprint was overcoming various shortcomings of the NEXTEL Communications Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN) which it acquired in 2005. The spectrum holdings of Velocita were intended to supplement Nextel's frequencies in the 900 MHz band and help relieve expected congestion in its network's 800 MHz band.
On July 2, 2007 Velocita Wireless was bought by United Wireless.
In 2010, Velocita Wireless emerged from internal restructuring to focus its narrow-band nationwide wireless data networks on machine-to-machine telemetry solutions for Point-of-Sale credit card transactions, utility/energy smart grid applications, automatic vehicle location (AVL), home and business security, and wireless vending.

Eric Parker (American football)

Eric Samuel Parker (born April 14, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Tennessee Volunteers and was signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted free agent in 2002.
Parker spent the first six seasons of his career with the San Diego Chargers.
Early life.
Parker attended Joliet West High School in Joliet, Illinois.
College career.
Parker attended the University of Tennessee after graduating from Joliet West.
Professional career.
Houston Texans.
Coming out of college, Parker was labeled as injury-prone and thus was passed over in the draft. He was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted free agent, but was released by in July.
San Diego Chargers.
Shortly after his release from the Texans, Parker was signed by the San Diego Chargers. He spent some time on the practice squad and eventually made the active roster in late 2002.
Parker had a productive campaign in 2003 before a shoulder injury cut his season short. His best season was in 2005 when he caught 57 passes for 725 yards. During the 2006 offseason, the Chargers signed Parker to a new five-year deal.
In 2006, Parker and then #1 wide receiver Keenan McCardell both ended the season with zero touchdown catches. Teammates LaDainian Tomlinson, tight end Antonio Gates and wide receiver Vincent Jackson accounted for the majority of the Chargers' scores.
Parker's 2006 season came to a disappointing end in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. In a game the Chargers lost to the New England Patriots by three points, Parker dropped two passes and fumbled a crucial third-quarter punt, which led to three points for the opposing team.
In 2007, Eric Parker injured his toe during training camp. This led to the Chargers putting him on season-ending injured reserve. He was released by the team on July 23, 2008.
In March 2009, Eric Parker joined the coaching staff of the San Diego Chargers as a wide receivers and conditioning assistant.
He also coaches track at Helix Charter High School.

Prema Tarangalu

Prema Tarangalu () is a 1980 Indian Telugu-language film directed by S. P. Chitti Babu. The film stars Krishnam Raju, Jayasudha, and Chiranjeevi. It is a remake of the Hindi film "Muqaddar Ka Sikandar" (1978).
Plot.
Orphaned and abused at a very young age, a young boy, Vijay struggles to make a living by slaving day and night, working in the house of a wealthy man named Ranga Rao (Kanta Rao). Rao does not like Vijay. It is later revealed that another orphan had taken advantage of his kindness in the past, hence his animosity. Rao's young daughter Sujata, however, empathizes with the boy and they form a friendship. Eventually, he is adopted by a woman (Savitri) who also works for Ranga Rao. On Sujata's birthday, Vijay who promised to replace one of her dolls which he had broken, steals an expensive doll from a shop to give as a gift. However, Rao refuses to let the boy attend the party and when Vijay breaks into Sujata's room to deliver the doll he is caught and accused of trying to rob the house. He and his mother are banished from the Rao household. Shortly thereafter, Vijay's mother dies, leaving him with the responsibility of looking after her daughter.
As Vijay is crying in the graveyard, a fakir comes to him and asks him to embrace the woes of life and find happiness in sadness, for then he would become the conqueror of fate. A grown up Vijay (Krishnam Raju) has amassed a fortune by turning in smuggled goods to the police and receiving the reward payouts. With all his wealth, he has built an impressive house for himself and set up a profitable business.
Vijay still has not forgotten Sujata (Sujatha) from his childhood. She and her father have fallen on hard times, and Vijay is anonymously supporting them. Eventually, he gets up the nerve to try to talk to Sujata, but she still believes that he betrayed her family, and she snubs him. Vijay is upset by the refusal and becomes a heavy drinker. He also visits Jaya Sudha's brothel on a regular basis. One night, in the bar Vijay meets up with Kumar (Chiranjeevi) and a friendship, is formed between them when Kumar risks his own life to save Vijay from a bomb blast. Vijay introduces Kumar to Ranga Rao and the two begin to work together.
Jaya eventually falls in an unrequited love with Vijay, and this in turn angers Gangulu (Kaikala Satyanarayana), a hardcore criminal who loves Jaya and will kill anyone who lays an eye on her. Upon finding that Vijay is frequently visiting Jaya, Gangulu confronts Vijay and in the ensuing fight is thrashed by him. He swears to kill Vijay.
Sujata discovers Vijay's kindness to her family and goes to thank him. Encouraged, Vijay tries to profess his love to Sujatha through a love letter. Because Vijay himself is illiterate, Kumar transcribes the letter for him, but the plan backfires when Sujata mistakes the letter as actually being from Kumar. Kumar, unaware that Sujata is the girl Vijay loves, reciprocates her love, and the two begin to date. Vijay, upon learning this, struggles with his emotions but decides he must sacrifice his love for the sake of his friendship with Kumar. Kumar and Sujata plan to marry.
Vijay's visits to Jaya have hampered his reputation, and the upcoming marriage of his sister is at risk of being canceled over his behavior. Kumar, knowing Vijay don't change, visits Jaya and offers to pay her if she abandons Vijay. Jaya, upon learning the reason, promises Kumar that she would sooner die than let Vijay visit her again. Later, Vijay arrives at Jaya's brothel and she refuses to let him in. Vijay demands entry and when Jaya is unable to stop him she kills herself by swallowing a diamond and dies in his arms.
Gangulu, in the meanwhile, has formed an alliance with Vijay's arch enemy and upon learning of Jaya's death hatches a plan to destroy Vijay and his family. Sujata and Vijay's sister are preparing for their weddings; the goons kidnap Vijay's sister but Kumar follows them and rescues her. Gangulu kidnaps Sujata, but Vijay follows him. He rescues Sujata and sends her home while he fights Gangulu. In the final battle, both Gangulu and Vijay are mortally wounded and Vijay tells Gangulu that he never loved Jaya. Gangulu feels regret and dies. A dying Vijay reaches the wedding of Sujata and Kumar. Just as the wedding ceremony is completed, Vijay collapses. His dying words inadvertently reveal his love for Sujata and he dies.

Precision 15

The Precision 15, also called the Precision 15 K (for keel), is an American trailerable sailboat, that was designed by Jim Taylor and first built in 1995.
A sailing dinghy version with a centerboard and no ballast was also built and designated the Precision 15 CB.
Production.
The design was built by Precision Boat Works in Palmetto, Florida, United States from 1995 to 2018. More than 800 examples of both models were produced.
Design.
The Precision 15 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with a vinyl ester resin skin coat. It has a fractional sloop rig with anodized aluminum spars and a hinged mast step. The hull has a raked stem, a plumb transom, a transom-hung, kick-up rudder controlled by a wooden tiller, with a tiller extension and a fixed keel. The boat has foam flotation, a boom vang and jib tracks.
The design displaces and carries of ballast. The boat has a draft of , enabling ground transportation on a trailer.
The manufacturer lists the boat's design goals as "safety, stability, reliable handling, and sprightly speed under sail".
An optional mount may be fitted for a small outboard motor for docking and maneuvering.
Operational history.
In a 2003 review of the Precision 15 K by naval architect Robert Perry, he wrote, "the target market for this boat could be family day-sailing, but the 15 would also make a very nice trainer. The hull is broad enough to provide stability without acrobatics. At 600 pounds the boat is also light enough to be fast and responsive. The broad and flattish sections aft mean that the 15 will be stable off the wind in a breeze. In light air you can move crew weight forward and get the tail out of the water to reduce wetted surface. The keel is a bulb-end plate-type with a draft of only 1 foot, 8 inches. The rudder is considerably deeper than the keel. I'd like to see a deeper keel, but I realize that Taylor and Precision have become very adept at doing these minimal-draft appendages."

Shafston College

Shafston International College is a private education institution for international students located in Brisbane and the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. It offers vocational training, Adult English language programs, High School Preparation, Study Tour and University Pathway programs. In November 2020, it was announced that Shafston would temporarily close, with the building and contents to be auctioned. In the mid of 2021, Shafston International College has completed the ownership transition and re-open the campus to the international market.
Shafston was established in 1996 and has grown rapidly with over 70,000 students having attended since its inception. Shafston has a diverse student population with over 40 different nationalities on campus at any given time.
Shafston features four campuses, one in the heart of Brisbane, two in Southport on the Gold Coast and the other in Sydney. The original Kangaroo Point Campus, which is centred on Shafston House, a heritage-listed building constructed in 1851, is located on the banks of the Brisbane River and covers an area of five-acres. The Sydney campus which is nearby Hyde Park will open at the beginning of 2025 for Study Tour and English Language Programs.
Shafston is accredited by the National ELT Accreditation Scheme (NEAS) and a member of English Australia. The college is a Public Testing Centre for TOEIC (Test of English for International Communication) and TOEFL Testing Centre (Test of English as a Foreign Language), and a preparation centre for University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations. Shafston’s Kangaroo Point and Gold Coast campuses are also home to Shafston Cambridge Exam Centre, approved by the University of Cambridge to administer ESOL examinations in south-east Queensland. Shafston also offers TESOL accreditation.
Shafston College has been rocked by a series of scandals, with regular appearances on television current affairs shows leaving the reputation of the college somewhat tainted. In 2004, the former college president, Keith Lloyd, was accused of paying teenage students for sex. This was widely reported in the Australian and overseas media and featured a secretly taped conversation. In early 2008, the college was again in the news as reports surfaced of lecturers directed that "no student should fail" a tertiary level nursing course because "you can't do this because students are paying good money for the course". The resultant media coverage and subsequent investigation of practices at Shafston College resulted in the course being deaccredited by the Queensland Nursing Council. In September 2011, it was reported in the media that Shafston could possibly face liquidation proceedings in the Supreme Court over unpaid commissions to an agent; the matter was subsequently settled out of court.
In July 2011, the Shafston House Estate celebrated its 160th year.
In 2024, Shafston was a finalist in the International Education and Training category of the Premier of Queensland's Export Awards 2024.

The Magic Comic

The Magic Comic was a British comics magazine. It was the ill-fated third comics magazine from DC Thomson (after "The Beano" and "The Dandy"). It was aimed at a younger audience, with more emphasis on picture stories. The first issue was published on 22 July 1939. The comic ran for only 80 issues until 25 January 1941. Paper rationing resulting from the outbreak of the Second World War caused its demise. Its Editor Bill Powrie promised that 'the Magic' would return; however, he was killed in action in 1942.
Two annuals, named "The Magic Fun Book", were also published in 1941 and 1942. From 1943 to 1949, "The Magic Comic" would share its annual with "The Beano", under the title, "The Magic-Beano Book". The cover star was Koko the Pup who would later team up with Big Eggo in the Magic-Beano Books between 1943 and 1950 in the story named Eggo and Koko.
A first issue of "The Magic comic" was sold on eBay in February 2006 for £1,250 to a collector, and it was one of only 6 copies known to exist. A 'Very Fine' copy was also sold in 1997 for £2,975. On 20 January 2015 the first 24 issues of The Magic Comic were sold for £13,000 (+20% commission; 15,600); it came to £650 per comic.
On 31 January 1976 DC Thomson revived the Magic Comic. This incarnation would go on to last until 1979. The new version was aimed at younger audience than "The Beano" and "Dandy" and was more of a pre-school comic than the original "Magic" comic. The comic was loosely concerned with magic of all kinds. Even though this new comic was considered a revival it contained none of the characters that appeared in the earlier "Magic". However it did contain characters from "The Beano" with a spinoff of Biffo the Bear involving his niece and nephew, Cuddly and Dudley, appearing in the new comic.

KAHI

KAHI (950 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a news/talk format. Licensed to Auburn, California, United States, the station serves the Auburn area. The station is owned by Relevant Radio; the KAHI Corporation programs the station under a time brokerage agreement. KAHI is paired with expanded band station KSMH (1620 AM), which serves as Relevant Radio's Sacramento station.
Programming.
The station broadcasts locally produced programming, San Francisco Giants baseball, Sacramento Kings basketball, San Jose Sharks hockey, Sierra College and local high school football. When not carrying live broadcasts, KAHI carries nationally syndicated talk radio shows.
, the station produced several local programs that aired weekdays, including news blocks during drive time and in the noon hour, along with an evening talk show hosted by Mary Jane Popp. The station's moniker then was "The Voice of the Foothills".
KAHI carried Oakland Athletics baseball as an affiliate of the Oakland Athletics Radio Network for 57 years through 2024. Concurrent with the temporary move of the Athletics (A's) to West Sacramento as part of their relocation to Las Vegas, and the move of the team's Sacramento radio broadcasts from KHTK to KSTE, KAHI announced that it would no longer carry A's baseball. On March 12, 2025, KAHI reached a deal with the San Francisco Giants and flagship station KNBR/KNBR-FM to carry that team's games.
History.
KAHI began broadcasting in 1957, originally licensed to Placer Broadcasters for 500 watts on 950 kHz, daytime-only.
Expanded Band assignment.
On March 17, 1997, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that 88 stations had been given permission to move to newly available "Expanded Band" transmitting frequencies, from 1610 to 1700 kHz. KAHI was authorized to move to 1620 kHz, and in 1998 the expanded band station began broadcasting as KSMH.
The FCC's initial plan provided that both the original station and its expanded band counterpart could optionally operate simultaneously for up to five years, after which owners would have to turn in one of the two licenses, depending on whether they preferred the new assignment or elected to remain on the original frequency. However, this deadline has been extended numerous times, and both KAHI and KSMH have remained authorized. One restriction is that the FCC has generally required paired original and expanded band stations to remain under common ownership.

Lido 14

The Lido 14 is an American sailing dinghy that was designed by Barney Lehman and William D. Schock and first built in 1958.
The design was derived from the Lehman 14.
Production.
The design is built by W. D. Schock Corp in the United States. When it was introduced it became a quick commercial success, with 1,000 boats completed in the first three years and almost 3,000 by 1970. The success of the design was instrumental in the company expanding to become a major builder of sailboats. A total of 6,100 boats have been completed and it remains in production.
Design.
The Lido 14 is a recreational sailboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a fractional sloop rig, with gold-colored anodized aluminum spars and a loose-footed mainsail. The hull features a spooned plumb stem, a near-vertical transom, a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable centerboard that is raised with stainless steel straps. Both the rudder and centerboard are made from foam-cored fiberglass. It displaces and has positive flotation under the seats and in the bow compartment.
In 1995 the boat was redesigned with a new two-piece mold to simplify construction, plus many other changes.
The boat has a draft of with the centerboard extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer.
For sailing the design is equipped with a 2:1 mechanical advantage outhaul and a boom vang. The jib has a pad eye for a whisker pole, which is a factory option, along with hiking straps.
The design is used as a one-design racer and has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 99.6. It has a large cockpit that can accommodate six adults, but it is raced with a crew of two sailors.
Operational history.
In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood described the boat as a "child's boat, racer and sailer. The Lido 14 evolved from the earlier Lehman 14 via a rather complete redesign including sheer, seats, foredeck, and sail plan. The cockpit length allows for six adults on full-length seats. The seats, with a bow compartment, provide flotation. Only limited modifications are allowed for racing, as the intention is to keep Lido a simple, limited boat."

Caribbean Airlines

Caribbean Airlines Limited is the state-owned airline and flag carrier of Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica. Headquartered in Iere House in Piarco, the airline operates flights to the Caribbean, North America and South America from its base at Piarco International Airport, Trinidad. Presently Caribbean Airlines employs more than 1,600 people and is the largest airline in the Caribbean. The company slogan is "The Warmth of the Islands."
History.
Early years.
Caribbean Airlines was incorporated in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago on 27 September 2006.
In September 2006, following the recommendation of Peter Davies, the CEO of BWIA West Indies Airways, Caribbean Airlines got approval from the Trinidad and Tobago government to begin operations, after the failed negotiations between the unions and the management of its predecessor, BWIA. As a result, it was announced on 8 September 2006, that BWIA was to be shut down before the launch of Caribbean Airlines. During the last quarter of 2006, in an effort to scale down operations for the start of Caribbean Airlines, BWIA's management cut routes such as Manchester Airport, London Heathrow Airport, New York City and Toronto, with intermediate stops at Barbados or Antigua, ceased services to and from Saint Lucia, cut its fleet to six Boeing 737-800 jet aircraft retrofitted with wingtip devices (winglets) and reduced its staff to 800, with a majority of the staff former BWIA workers now contracted.
The new airline's capital included funds to close and settle BWIA's operations. The company commenced operations on 1 January 2007, servicing the remaining routes of BWIA.
Caribbean Airlines began operations with a fleet of six Boeing 737-800 aircraft and one Airbus A340-313 with the latter aircraft type operating the London Heathrow route until May 2007. The airline offered two classes of service, first/business class and economy class on both the Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Caribbean Airlines operated daily direct services to Miami, Toronto, New York, Jamaica (with stops in Barbados and Antigua/St. Maarten), Guyana, Suriname and London Heathrow till May 2007 due to the ICC 2007 Cricket World Cup, all out of its hub at Piarco International Airport. Peter Davies resigned from his position as CEO, effective 30 September 2007, but remained as a strategic advisor to Caribbean Airlines. In the first half of 2007, two Airbus A340-200 planes and a Boeing 737 Next Generation Boeing 737-800, 9Y-GND, were returned to International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and GE Commercial Aviation Services (GECAS), respectively.
On 1 October 2007, Philip Saunders, Star Alliance VP Commercial, was appointed the new chief executive officer of Caribbean Airlines. Subsequently, the airline took over operations of Tobago Express, its domestic arm at a cost of US$24 million with the intentions to upgrade the fleet of Bombardier Dash-8 Q300 to international standards and also adding new Caribbean destinations to be served via this regional airline subsidiary.
In March 2008, the airline added a daily direct service to the Simón Bolívar International Airport in Caracas, using the Dash 8 aircraft. In May 2008, Caribbean Airlines acquired a seventh Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The airline added a new U.S. route on 22 May to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport from Piarco International Airport. This route began operations on a four times per week schedule and later in July of the same year, the frequency was increased to daily service.
On 15 November 2008, Transavia Airlines agreed to operate a wet-lease operation on behalf of Caribbean Airlines, it increased its fleet to eight Boeing 737-800. The aircraft was re-fitted to the standard 16/138 configuration including an extra nine inches of seat pitch in the business class cabin, due to a different galley and closet placement. This allowed the airline to increase flight frequency to meet demand for the peak travel periods. The lease was contracted to be in effect until 15 April 2009. The aircraft was returned in June 2009, and Sun Country Airlines, a U.S. air carrier, then leased a Boeing 737-800 to Caribbean Airlines.
In April 2009, the airline increased its frequency of service to Simón Bolívar International Airport in Caracas from a daily service to ten flights per week. The route was operated by the Bombardier Dash-8 Q300, configured for 50 passengers in an all economy service. Daily flights to its gateways Fort Lauderdale and Miami continued. Services to Toronto and New York City remained at twice daily and 20 weekly (up to 28 weekly in peak season), respectively.
On 27 July 2009, Philip Saunders announced his resignation as CEO of Caribbean Airlines, for personal reasons. Caribbean Airlines appointed Captain Ian Brunton in October 2009 as CEO of the airline. Also in 2009, Caribbean Airlines operated services from the southern Caribbean to Jamaica, as well as South America, including Suriname, Guyana and Venezuela. The airline also continued to serve the United States and Canada, in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, New York City and Toronto, having also established a codeshare agreement with British Airways, for services to London and beyond. As of 2009, the airline operated a fleet of eight Boeing 737-800 aircraft and five Bombardier Dash-8 Q300 aircraft, out of its main hub at Piarco International Airport, Trinidad. The Dash 8 aircraft have since been replaced with new ATR 72-600, a larger turboprop aircraft.
Acquisition of Air Jamaica.
Caribbean Airlines Limited, through the government of Trinidad and Tobago, announced plans to operate a base in Jamaica following the divestment of Air Jamaica which was slated to occur between 30 April 2010 to that same period in 2011. Caribbean Airlines provided a seamless transition following Air Jamaica's closure. When the deal was finalized, Caribbean Airlines Limited became the largest airline in the Caribbean with a new hub in Kingston Jamaica's Norman Manley International Airport. The divestment was scheduled to become effective on 30 April 2010 after it was rescheduled from 12 April 2010. On this day, it was planned that Air Jamaica would cease operations and Caribbean Airlines will then acquire the airline's most profitable routes and their remaining six aircraft. Plans were also announced to replace the aircraft fleet with all Boeing 737-800 Next Generation jets.
On 4 March 2010, Caribbean Airlines announced they would terminate their codeshare agreement with British Airways for the Port of Spain-London Gatwick route effective 27 March 2010 thus paving the way for a nonstop service to be operated by Caribbean between Piarco International Airport and London, UK.
On 28 April 2010, Caribbean Airlines Limited and Air Jamaica signed a final agreement for the purchase of Air Jamaica by Caribbean Airlines Limited, following the signing of a letter of intent to merge in January of the same year. The agreement stated that Caribbean would continue operating Air Jamaica's routes and also retain 900 of Air Jamaica's employees. Financing was provided by the government of Trinidad and Tobago, which contributed around $50 million to complete the merger, and Jamaica, which assumed more than $800 million in costs related to the closure of Air Jamaica.
In August 2010, Caribbean Airlines and Air India signed a travel pact for Trinidadians travelling to India. In October, the airline announced a fleet renewal consisting of fifteen (15) Boeing 737-800 Next Generation jets and nine ATR 72-600 turboprop aircraft. The new Boeing jets were intended to replace Air Jamaica's operating fleet of Airbus aircraft.
On 27 May 2011, the acquisition of Air Jamaica was completed, with Finance Minister Winston Dookeran and Jamaican Finance Minister Audley Shaw at the Prime Minister' St. Clair office, signing the shareholding agreement. This agreement allows the Jamaican government to own a 16% stake of Caribbean Airlines Limited. On 28 October 2011, the U.S. Department of Transportation fined Caribbean Airlines $60,000 for limiting reimbursements for lost, damaged and delayed baggage to less than consumers were entitled under the Montreal Convention.
According to chairman of the board of Caribbean Airlines George Nicholas III, Caribbean Airlines is pursuing a relationship with Star Alliance, the world's largest airline alliance, in an effort to support Jamaican hoteliers. It is also reported they are preparing to start a route to Mumbai, but no date has been given. Also, Nicholas announced that Johannesburg, Nigeria, and Brazil are possible contenders for new routes. Chicago and Atlanta are the two new U.S. gateways that are being considered, Nicholas stated.
On 29 March 2013, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) fined the airline $100,000 for not providing passengers with an opportunity to leave a plane that was delayed on the tarmac at New York's JFK Airport for more than four hours.
In early 2016, the management of Caribbean Airlines has set as an agenda to consider replacing its ATR fleet with comparable turboprops sourced from Bombardier due to persistent reliability problems. The former chief executive officer (CEO) Michael Di Lollo described the ATRs as "not mission capable" after they suffered from frequent AOG (Aircraft On Ground) occurrences. On his recommendation, efforts were made to sourcing Dash 8-400 aircraft to replace the carrier's fleet of five ATR72-600s.
Also in early 2016, the airline returned its two Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to their lessor, coinciding with termination of its only European route to London Gatwick Airport on 10 January 2016, as part of a streamlining exercise to remove unprofitable routes.
In 2018, the airline posted an order for 737 MAX-8 aircraft, to replace the aging fleet of 737-800 aircraft. The order was initially placed in 2018, and put on hold after the grounding of the 737 MAX family.
Also in 2018, the services Caribbean Cafe and Caribbean Plus were launched for the first time. Caribbean Plus served as an upgraded economy class with larger seats and extra legroom, but with the same service. Caribbean Cafe offered buy-on-board local snacks, drinks and amenities.
In 2019, the airline posted its first profit of four million ($4,000,000 U.S.) dollars.
Rebranding and revitalization.
In 2020, the airline began a rebranding exercise, introducing a new logo and livery. The first aircraft to receive the new livery, was an ATR 72-600, 9Y-TTI. The new logo retains the iconic hummingbird while infusing fluid lines and brighter hues to embody the spirit of flight, the vibrancy of Caribbean culture and connectivity within the region. The rest of the existing ATR fleet was repainted gradually, with the last aircraft being repainted in 2024. 
In late 2021, the airline began receiving the first of 12 737 MAX-8 aircraft, ordered previously in 2018. The delivery came a year after the 737 MAX was cleared for service by the FAA. Over the course of the next few months, the airline received 9 of these aircraft, ultimately phasing out the 737-800 entirely by 2023.
The new aircraft were painted in the rebranded livery, with a vastly modernized cabin. The cabin configuration was very similar to that of the 737-800, albeit with slightly more seats. Caribbean View, a stream-to-your-device onboard entertainment system was implemented previously, but was improved on the new aircraft including personal touchscreens for Business Class Passengers.
In 2023, the airline announced that flights to Caracas, Venezuela would be restarted on a weekly basis, with frequency expected to increase. Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, Caribbean Airlines began flights to Dominica, restarted flights to Ft. Lauderdale and Caracas, introduced a temporary route from Georgetown, Guyana to Houston and stated their plans for fleet expansion and additional destinations in the Caribbean.
In July 2023, it was announced that new flights to Tortola, British Virgin Islands and San Juan, Puerto Rico were tentatively approved. An Eastern Caribbean route expansion, including flights to Basseterre, St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, was also announced with new flights from Barbados, St. Lucia-Castries, St. Vincent-Argyle, Dominica-Douglas Charles and Antigua. This route expansion coincided with the airline's order for additional ATR 72-600 aircraft.
In July 2024, the airline began nonstop service between Port of Spain and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Flights to Tortola, British Virgin Islands were announced for October 2024 operating on a milk-run service between Trinidad, Antigua/Barbados, Tortola and San Juan. In October 2024, flights to both Martinique and Guadeloupe were announced for December 2024, and the airline was given further clearance from the government to acquire additional aircraft for expansions into North and South America. 
As of October 2024, the TSA PreCheck program announced that Caribbean Airlines has been added to the list of new participating airlines.
Corporate affairs.
Branding.
The colors of Caribbean Airlines are blue, green and purple and are represented in the new staff uniforms, all featuring the hummingbird, the logo of Caribbean Airlines.
BWIA's logo was a steelpan. Caribbean Airlines' image is a hummingbird in flight. The image is a reference to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, where the island of Trinidad is known as "the land of the hummingbird". All aircraft in the fleet carry the flag of Trinidad and Tobago, as well as the flag of CARICOM.
The airline had four designs on the tails of its de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 regional aircraft before these twin turboprops were phased out of the fleet (9Y-WIT was not painted). One of the designs raised controversy, due to its usage of the Balisier flower, the symbol of the former ruling People's National Movement political party. The logo was subsequently redesigned without the flower and replaced with fruits. The tail designs featured a steelpan, cricket balls, fruits, corals, fish and butterflies.
Caribbean Airlines has a theme song arranged in a traditional Trinidadian calypso music style. It was originally recorded by Explainer and the song is called "Lorraine". The original lyrics, which talk about a man who needs to escape the cold United States and get back to the Caribbean, were modified to fit Caribbean Airlines.
In 2020, the airline rebranded itself by launching a new logo and livery. The first aircraft to receive the new livery, is the airline's 9Y-TTI ATR aircraft. The new logo retains the iconic hummingbird while infusing fluid lines and brighter hues to embody the spirit of flight, the vibrancy of Caribbean culture and connectivity within the region.
Inflight magazine.
Caribbean Beat Magazine, established in 1992, is Caribbean Airlines' complimentary, bi-monthly in-flight magazine. It has been produced since inception by Media and Editorial Projects Limited. When the print magazine had to be temporarily removed from flights because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a digital-only version was introduced in July 2020, followed by a digital-only brand extension called "Wanderer by Caribbean Beat" in October 2020. "Caribbean Beat Magazine" returned to print format in March 2021.
Frequent flyer program.
The airline's frequent-flyer program is called "Caribbean Miles". The three tiers of the program are called Silver, Gold and Executive Gold.
Destinations.
Caribbean Airlines operates scheduled services to many destinations.
Interline agreements.
While there was a prior codeshare agreement between the carrier and Air Canada, Caribbean Airlines no longer undertakes these arrangements and instead has the more streamlined interline agreement alongside their partner airlines:
Caribbean Airlines has also Interline agreements with:

Iddaru Mitrulu (1999 film)

Iddaru Mitrulu () is a 1999 Indian Telugu-language drama film which was directed by K. Raghavendra Rao. This film stars Chiranjeevi, Sakshi Sivanand and Ramya Krishna. The film was released on 30 April 1999 to positive reviews. It was dubbed into Tamil as " Singanadai ".
Story.
Vijay (Chiranjeevi) and Anita (Sakshi Sivanand) are best friends. They share their thoughts, happiness, and pain with each other. One day Anita finds love in a photographer, Prakash (Suresh) and marries him, while Vijay plays a lover boy and marries Shanti (Ramya Krishna). However, Anita's happiness ends when she finds out that her husband is two-timing her. Vijay consoles her but his wife is unhappy that he spends so much time with her and gives him an ultimatum. He chooses his friend and takes care of her and her unborn child and later reunites her with her husband. Anita wants to see her friend in a happy state as well and reunites him with Shanti. The film ends on a happy note, with the happy couples holding the newborn baby.
Soundtrack.
The music for this film was composed by Manisharma. The audio was a huge hit and all the songs were chartbusters. All the tracks were massive hits, especially the tracks "Hey Rukku" featuring Rambha, "Nootokka Jillalo" gained much mass attention due to heavy dance steps. The track "Bangaram Techhi" sung by K. S. Chithra and Partha Sarathi was critically acclaimed due to the emotional rendition provided by Chitra in the song suiting the situation in the movie.
Reception.
"Idlebrain" wrote "It is a very atypical of Raghavendra Rao and Chiru combination to select such a soft story. He did not do complete justice to direction as he seem to have lost his grip over subject during the last two reels. Muthaya Subbaiah or Jayanth would have handled this story in a better manner. He hurried at the end giving a complete anti-climax". "Andhra Online" wrote "You have great expectations when it is a Chiranjeevi film. More so when it is directed by Raghavendra Rao. Sad to say, expectations fall flat, at least when it comes to the story which is anything but new. How many times, Oh! How many times has friendship between a man and a woman and the misunderstandings about it been dealt with? Innumerable".

Maxivision

Maxivision 24 and Maxivision 48 are 35 mm film motion picture film formats. The system was designed by Dean Goodhill in 1999. The system uses normal thirty-five millimetre motion picture film, capturing images on three perforations of film per frame. The format can run either at the standard twenty-four frames per second, or at forty-eight frames per second, which reduces strobing effects and increases apparent resolution when combined with a system for reducing film movement in the gate and eliminating scratching.
Because Maxivision uses only three film perforations per frame, the twenty-four-frame-per-second format uses 25% less film than standard four-perforation formats, and the 48 frame-per-second format only requires a 50% increase in the amount of film to yield twice the frame rate. The image is exposed into the region ordinarily reserved for the analog optical sound track which is rarely used now. This allows for a wider image on the same size film. This also reduces the need for cropping of the image and makes for a 30% larger total frame area than traditional projection even though less film is used.
The advancements of this system go beyond simply a larger image with less waste, however. The projector head is far more stable than traditional projection systems. It uses a sophisticated grid tracking charge-coupled device to automatically detect and compensate for any changes in the film type and position making projection of even traditional thirty-five millimeter prints sharper, more steady and with less chance of damage to the film.
Critic Roger Ebert repeatedly praised the system, saying that the picture quality is "four times as good" as traditional film projection, and "provides a picture of startling clarity."
The format uses a custom-built projector head that can be switched between standard 35 millimeter formats and Maxivision. Furthermore, the new projector head is able to change from anamorphic to Maxivision and standard matte prints on the fly. This reduces the chances of operator error and cuts the costs of having to order special trailers for different movie formats.

Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)

"Real Love" is a song written by David Malloy, Richard "Spady" Brannon and Randy McCormick, and recorded as a duet by American entertainers Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers that topped the US country singles chart in August 1985. It was released in April 1985 the second single and title track from Parton's "Real Love" album. Released after the top-ten success of "Don't Call It Love", the song became Parton and Rogers' second country chart-topper as a duet act. However, "Real Love" did not fare as well on the pop singles charts as 1983's "Islands in the Stream" had done, stalling at number 91 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and number 13 on the Adult Contemporary chart.
Unlike "Islands in the Stream", "Real Love" was not composed by the Bee Gees, who had composed and produced Rogers' 1983 chart-topping album "Eyes That See in the Dark". That album also included another four of Rogers' hit singles from 1983 and 1984, namely "Buried Treasure", "This Woman", "Midsummer Nights" and "Evening Star".
Parton and Rogers embarked on a nine-city US concert tour in February 1985, from which an HBO concert special, "Real Love" was filmed; a music video for the "Real Love" single was produced using footage from the HBO special.
Parton also recorded a solo version in November 1984, which was later included on the 1995 album "I Will Always Love You: The Essential Dolly Parton One".

Everybody Loves Somebody

"Everybody Loves Somebody" is a song written in 1947 by Irving Taylor and pianist Ken Lane, and made famous by Dean Martin who recorded and released his version in 1964.
History.
Written almost 20 years earlier, by 1964 the song had already been recorded by several artists. The song was first recorded by Peggy Lee with Dave Barbour and his orchestra on November 20, 1947 for Capitol. Two weeks later Frank Sinatra recorded the song for Columbia with Axel Stordahl conducting the orchestra on December 4, 1947, but wasn’t released and issued until mid- 1948. Though none of the recordings were a success. Lane was playing piano for Dean Martin on his "Dream with Dean" LP sessions, and with an hour or so of studio time left and one song short, Lane suggested that Martin take a run at his tune. Dean was agreeable, and the small combo of piano, guitar, drums, and bass performed a relatively quiet, laid-back version of the song (coincidentally, Martin had sung it almost 20 years earlier on Bob Hope's radio show in 1948, and also on Martin and Lewis's NBC radio program at about the same time). Almost immediately Martin re-recorded the song for his next album, this time with a full orchestra and chorus. His label, Reprise Records, was so enthusiastic about the hit potential of this version they titled the LP "Everybody Loves Somebody" to capitalize on it.
Although still a major recording artist, Dean Martin had not had a top 40 hit since 1958. With the British Invasion ruling the U.S. charts, few had hopes that an Italian American crooner who had been singing mainly standards for almost 20 years would sway many teenagers. Martin resented rock n' roll, and his attitude created conflict at home with his 12-year-old son Dean Paul Martin, who like many young people at the time worshipped pop groups like The Beatles. He told his son, "I'm gonna knock your pallies off the charts," and on August 15, 1964 he did just that: "Everybody Loves Somebody" knocked The Beatles' "A Hard Day's Night" off the No. 1 slot on "Billboard", going straight up to the top of both the "Billboard" Hot 100 and the Pop-Standard Singles chart, the latter for eight weeks.
It ultimately replaced "That's Amore" as Martin's signature song, and he sang it as the theme of his weekly television variety show from 1965 to 1974. The song has become so identified with Martin that later versions are invariably compared to his take.
"Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime" appears on Martin's grave marker in Los Angeles.
In 1999, the 1964 recording of "Everybody Loves Somebody" on Reprise Records by Dean Martin was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.
Covers.
Ray Gelato recorded a cover of the song inserted in the 2004 self-titled album (T2, TWR0131-2), released in the UK.
In 1965 the Danish trio, 3 Jacks, had recorded a Danish version called "Alle og enhver kan blive forelsket" (Any and everyone can fall in love). It never became a hit.
In 1975 Danish singer Gustav Winckler recorded a Danish version called "Gem et lille smil til det bli'r gråvejr" (Save a little smile 'till it's rainy). This became a big hit, and was released on Wincklers 25 years anniversary album.

Ward Chipman Jr.

Ward Chipman (July 10, 1787 – November 26, 1851) was a lawyer, judge and political figure in the pre-Confederation Province of New Brunswick, Canada.
He was born in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1787, the son of Ward Chipman and Elizabeth Hazen Chipman. He studied in Salem, Massachusetts, and then at Harvard College. He studied law in his father's office and became an attorney in 1808. In 1810, he went to London and continued his studies in law with George Sowley Holroyd, being admitted to the bar in England in 1812. On his return, he resumed practice and, in 1815, was named recorder for the city of Saint John. He later became a director of the Bank of New Brunswick. He assisted his father during negotiations held in 1816 with the state of Maine to determine the ownership of certain islands in Passamaquoddy Bay. In 1820, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick for Saint John County. In 1824, he was elected Speaker for the assembly. In 1825, after his father's death, he was named to the New Brunswick Supreme Court. In 1834, he was named chief justice for New Brunswick, which also made him president of the Legislative Council. He resigned from the council in 1842 and from his position as judge in 1850 due to illness.
He died in Saint John in 1851.

Newton College (Peru)

Newton College is a Peruvian British co-educational private school in Lima, Peru. It was founded in 1979 with the purpose of offering a modern, humanistic, technological education. It was to be British in outlook but with an international philosophy.
It is a semi-immersion, bilingual school delivering 50% of the curriculum in English and 50% in Spanish up to Year 3. As students progress through the school more of the curriculum is taught in English and for the IB Diploma Programme students may study five of their six chosen courses in English. Newton College was the first school in Peru to deliver the International Baccalaureate curriculum. It offers all its students the Primary Years Programme (2-11 year olds), the Middle Years Programme (11-16 year-olds), and the Diploma Programme (16-18 years olds).
The curriculum gives equal importance to all subjects and all three creative arts (Music, Drama and Visual Art) are taught to all students up to Year 8, when they become optional courses. All students learn to play a musical instrument from the age of 5. The school also offers a wide range of extra-curricular activities: community service projects, all major sports, Drama Club, Model United Nations, debating, gardening, scouts, etc. 
Newton College has approximately 1,560 students, 85% of whom are Peruvian. It is located in an 11 hectare campus next to a lake in the leafy suburb of la Molina. It has facilities, extensive sports fields and beautiful gardens. In addition, the school owns a large plot of land in the Amazon rainforest - the Sachavacayoc Centre, in the district of Tambopata (Madre de Dios), where there is a purpose-built study centre that allows secondary- aged students to study the different ecosystems and collect data for their IBDP Geography and Biology investigations; university students may apply to do postgraduate research at the centre.
In 2006, the British newspaper, "The Guardian Weekly", listed it as "one of the eight leading British-style, bilingual, international schools in the world".
The House System.
At Newton College students are divided into four houses that compete throughout the year in academic, cultural and sports activities such as football, volleyball, rugby, swimming, cross country, chess, quizzes, scavenge, debates, among others, in order to obtain the school shield. The four houses are Lancaster, Tudor, Windsor, and York, named after the British royal houses.

Subgame perfect equilibrium

In game theory, a subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE), or subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE), is a refinement of the Nash equilibrium concept, specifically designed for dynamic games where players make sequential decisions. A strategy profile is an SPE if it represents a Nash equilibrium in every possible subgame of the original game. Informally, this means that at any point in the game, the players' behavior from that point onward should represent a Nash equilibrium of the continuation game (i.e. of the subgame), no matter what happened before. This ensures that strategies are credible and rational throughout the entire game, eliminating non-credible threats.
Every finite extensive game with complete information (all players know the complete state of the game) and perfect recall (each player remembers all their previous actions and knowledge throughout the game) has a subgame perfect equilibrium. A common method for finding SPE in finite games is backward induction, where one starts by analyzing the last actions the final mover should take to maximize his/her utility and works backward. While backward induction is a common method for finding SPE in finite games, it is not always applicable to games with infinite horizons, or those with imperfect or incomplete information. In infinite horizon games, other techniques, like the one-shot deviation principle, are often used to verify SPE.
Subgame perfect equilibrium necessarily satisfies the one-shot deviation principle and is always a subset of the Nash equilibria for a given game. The ultimatum game is a classic example of a game with fewer subgame perfect equilibria than Nash equilibria.
Example.
Determining the subgame perfect equilibrium by using backward induction is shown below in Figure 1. Strategies for Player 1 are given by {Up, Uq, Dp, Dq}, whereas Player 2 has the strategies among {TL, TR, BL, BR}. There are 4 subgames in this example, with 3 proper subgames.
Using the backward induction, the players will take the following actions for each subgame:
Thus, the subgame perfect equilibrium is {Dp, TL} with the payoff (3, 3).
An extensive-form game with incomplete information is presented below in Figure 2. Note that the node for Player 1 with actions A and B, and all succeeding actions is a subgame. Player 2's nodes are not a subgame as they are part of the same information set.
The first normal-form game is the normal form representation of the whole extensive-form game. Based on the provided information, (UA, X), (DA, Y), and (DB, Y) are all Nash equilibria for the entire game.
The second normal-form game is the normal form representation of the subgame starting from Player 1's second node with actions A and B. For the second normal-form game, the Nash equilibrium of the subgame is (A, X).
For the entire game Nash equilibria (DA, Y) and (DB, Y) are not subgame perfect equilibria because the move of Player 2 does not constitute a Nash equilibrium. The Nash equilibrium (UA, X) is subgame perfect because it incorporates the subgame Nash equilibrium (A, X) as part of its strategy.
To solve this game, first find the Nash equilibria by mutual best response of Subgame 1. Then use backwards induction and plug in (A,X) → (3,4) so that (3,4) become the payoffs for Subgame 2.
The dashed line indicates that player 2 does not know whether player 1 will play A or B in a simultaneous game. 
Player 1 chooses U rather than D because 3 &gt; 2 for Player 1's payoff. The resulting equilibrium is (A, X) → (3,4). 
Thus, the subgame perfect equilibrium through backwards induction is (UA, X) with the payoff (3, 4).
Repeated games.
For finitely repeated games, if a stage game has only one unique Nash equilibrium, the subgame perfect equilibrium is to play without considering past actions, treating the current subgame as a one-shot game. An example of this is a finitely repeated Prisoner's dilemma game. The Prisoner's dilemma gets its name from a situation that contains two guilty culprits. When they are interrogated, they have the option to stay quiet or defect. If both culprits stay quiet, they both serve a short sentence. If both defect, they both serve a moderate sentence. If they choose opposite options, then the culprit that defects is free and the culprit who stays quiet serves a long sentence. Ultimately, using backward induction, the last subgame in a finitely repeated Prisoner's dilemma requires players to play the unique Nash equilibrium (both players defecting). Because of this, all games prior to the last subgame will also play the Nash equilibrium to maximize their single-period payoffs.
If a stage-game in a finitely repeated game has multiple Nash equilibria, subgame perfect equilibria can be constructed to play non-stage-game Nash equilibrium actions, through a "carrot and stick" structure. One player can use the one stage-game Nash equilibrium to incentivize playing the non-Nash equilibrium action, while using a stage-game Nash equilibrium with lower payoff to the other player if they choose to defect.
Finding subgame-perfect equilibria.
Reinhard Selten proved that any game which can be broken into "sub-games" containing a sub-set of all the available choices in the main game will have a subgame perfect Nash Equilibrium strategy (possibly as a mixed strategy giving non-deterministic sub-game decisions). Subgame perfection is only used with games of complete information. Subgame perfection can be used with extensive form games of complete but imperfect information.
The subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is normally deduced by "backward induction" from the various ultimate outcomes of the game, eliminating branches which would involve any player making a move that is not credible (because it is not optimal) from that node. One game in which the backward induction solution is well known is tic-tac-toe, but in theory even Go has such an optimum strategy for all players. The problem of the relationship between subgame perfection and backward induction was settled by Kaminski (2019), who proved that a generalized procedure of backward induction produces all subgame perfect equilibria in games that may have infinite length, infinite actions as each information set, and imperfect information if a condition of final support is satisfied.
The interesting aspect of the word "credible" in the preceding paragraph is that taken as a whole (disregarding the irreversibility of reaching sub-games) strategies exist which are superior to subgame perfect strategies, but which are not credible in the sense that a threat to carry them out will harm the player making the threat and prevent that combination of strategies. For instance in the game of "chicken" if one player has the option of ripping the steering wheel from their car they should always take it because it leads to a "sub game" in which their rational opponent is precluded from doing the same thing (and killing them both). The wheel-ripper will always win the game (making his opponent swerve away), and the opponent's threat to suicidally follow suit is not credible.

Bussey Institution

The Bussey Institute (1883–1936) was a respected biological institute at Harvard University. It was named for Benjamin Bussey, who, in 1835, endowed the establishment of an undergraduate school of agriculture and horticulture and donated land in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts that became the Arnold Arboretum. Bussey, a silversmith, had bought the land from the Weld family in 1806, and built a mansion in 1815. When he died, he left to Harvard. By 1871 the Bussey Institute had been built to a design by Peabody &amp; Stearns.
Notable alumni.
James Drummond Dole obtained a bachelor in agriculture at the Bussey Institute before moving to Hawaii and developing pineapple production and the canning industry there. Alfred Kinsey, an American biologist who became famous for his work on human sexuality, studied at the Bussey Institute under famed entomologist William Morton Wheeler. Edward Murray East, a pioneer in plant genetics, also worked there when he studied Mendelian inheritance. The geneticist William E. Castle worked there from 1908 until it closed in 1936, first on the genetics of fruit flies and also on hooded rats, studying basic evolution.

Forney locomotive

The Forney locomotive is a type of tank locomotive patented by Matthias N. Forney between 1861 and 1864 and used predominantly in the US.
Forney design.
Forney locomotives include the following characteristics:
History.
The locomotives were set up to run cab (or bunker) first, effectively as a (or ), though the type achieved popularity for its ability to operate well in either direction. The wheel arrangement, with its three-point suspension, was noted for its good tracking ability, while the flangeless middle wheels allowed the locomotive to round tight curves. Placing the fuel and water over the truck rather than the driving wheels meant the locos had a constant adhesive weight, something other forms of tank locomotive did not.
Large numbers of Forney locos were built for the surface and elevated commuter railroads that were built in cities such as New York, Chicago and Boston. These railroads required a small, fast locomotive that tracked well and could deal with tight curves. Their short runs meant the limited fuel and water capacity was not a problem, making the Forney ideal. However, their noise, smoke and tendency to drop ash and cinders (particularly from overhead tracks) made them unpopular. As these railroads began to electrify or were replaced by subways at the end of the 19th century, Forneys began to disappear.
Forneys were also popular on the narrow gauge railroads of Maine. The use of these locomotives differed in that they were run smokestack leading, like a conventional locomotive, and all driving wheels were flanged. The latter resulted in Maine narrow gauge railroads having comparatively broad radius curves. Further developments included the introduction of locomotives with a leading pony truck, giving a wheel arrangement. This was done to improve tracking ability in these locomotives.
Related designs.
The 0-4-4RT type was a precursor of other designs which may have drawn on the Forney, such as the Boston &amp; Albany and Central of New Jersey .
The Mason Locomotive Works, developed the Mason Bogie locomotive, a type of British Single Fairlie. Unlike the Forneys, the Mason Bogies were articulated locomotives: the boiler and fuel/water tank were on the main frame and the engine was on a separate steam "bogie" that was articulated to pivot beneath the boiler. Because the bogie was articulated, the reach rod and reversing lever were positioned above the main frame earning the locomotives the nickname "sewing machines."
Surviving locomotives.
Today, Forney locomotives can still be seen on Maine Narrow Gauge Railroad Museum The Hoosier Valley Railroad Museum and at the Forney Transportation Museum. The No. 3 and No. 5 locomotives on the Disneyland Railroad were originally built as Forneys, but are now Boston-type locomotives.

Mrs. Hume's pheasant

Mrs. Hume's pheasant (Syrmaticus humiae) (; literally, "one who follows the track of rain", Mizo: Vavu), also known as Hume's pheasant or the bar-tailed pheasant, is a large forest pheasant. It is the state bird of the Indian states of Mizoram and Manipur. The name commemorates Mary Ann Grindall Hume, wife of the British naturalist Allan Octavian Hume, one of the key founders of the Indian National Congress. 
Description.
The pheasant is up to long with a greyish brown head, bare red facial skin, chestnut brown plumage, yellowish bill, brownish orange iris, white wingbars and metallic blue neck feathers. The male has a long greyish white, barred black and brown tail. The female is a chestnut brown bird with whitish throat, buff colour belly and white-tipped tail.
Taxonomy.
Mrs. Hume's pheasant's has two recognised subspecies,
Distribution and population.
This rare and little known pheasant is found throughout forested habitats of the Mizoram, Patkai Range, Manipur, Yunnan and northern parts of Myanmar and Thailand. Its diet consists mainly of vegetation matter. The female lays three to twelve creamy white eggs in nests of leaves, twigs and feathers.
It is the state bird of Mizoram and Manipur.
Owing to ongoing habitat loss, fragmented population and being hunted for food, the Mrs. Hume's pheasant is evaluated as 'Vulnerable' on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.

Fred Phillis

Dennis Keith "Fred" Phillis (born 9 September 1948) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Glenelg Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL).
Background.
Born Dennis Keith Phillis, his schoolmates likened him to noted English Test cricket pace bowler Fred Trueman. He is almost exclusively known by his nickname.
Phillis is the brother of fellow Glenelg player and businessman Wayne Phillis.
History.
Phillis began his senior career with Glenelg in the SANFL in 1966 as a Centre half back under the coaching of Len Fitzgerald. He was soon moved to Centre half-forward and later Full-forward by incoming 1967 coach Neil Kerley. This lateral thinking paid off with Phillis kicking a then SANFL record of 137 goals in 1969.
He polled 18 votes in the 1969 Magarey Medal to be the first player to win the medal having played chiefly at full-forward for the season.
He played in Glenelg's 1973 Grand Final win over North Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval, and in losing Grand Finals for Glenelg against Sturt in 1969 and 1974, Norwood in 1975, and Port Adelaide in 1977 and 1981. Quirkily enough, in the 1973 grand final win by Glenelg over North Adelaide, he failed to kick a goal.
In perhaps Glenelg's most memorable non-finals game, Phillis scored 18 goals at Glenelg Oval in Round 18 of the 1975 SANFL season as part of the team's record-breaking 49.23 (317) to 11.13 (79) win over Central District, and kicked his 100th goal for the season during the match.
Phillis is the highest goal scorer in the history of the Glenelg club, having kicked 836 goals in his 268-game, 14-year career, an average of 59.8 goals per season and 3.12 goals per match. He also kicked 48 goals in twelve night series matches for Glenelg, bringing his overall total to 884 goals from 280 matches in Glenelg colours.
This is all the more remarkable when considering that former league leading goal kickers Jack Owens (1927–1928, 1932) and Colin Churchett (1948–1951) are also Glenelg champions.
, Phillis is third on the all time SANFL goal scoring list behind legendary North Adelaide full-forward Ken Farmer (1,417 from 1929–41), and Port Adelaide champion Tim Evans (992 from 1975–86): Owens sits 4th on the list with 827 goals, while Churchett is 15th with 555.
After retiring as a player, Phillis continued to pursue his chosen career as an architect.
