Azerbaijanis in Russia

Azerbaijanis in Russia or Russian Azerbaijanis ( (Latin), Русија азәрбајҹанлылары (Cyrillic); , "Azerbajdzhantsy v Rossii") are people of Azeri descent in Russia. These may be either ethnic Azeris residents in the country or recent immigrants who profess Azeri ancestry.
Aside from the large Azeri community native to Russia's Dagestan Republic, the majority of Azeris in Russia are fairly recent immigrants. Azeris started settling in Russia (with the exception of Dagestan) around the late nineteenth century, but their migration intensified after World War II, and especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. According to the 2010 All-Russian Population Census, there are 603,070 Azeris residing in Russia, however the actual numbers may be much higher due to the arrival of guest workers in the post-Soviet era. The estimated total Azeri population of Russia as of 2002 might have reached as many as 3,000,000 people, with more than one and half million of them living in Moscow, though in the following decade there was a tendency for many Azeris to move back to Azerbaijan. The majority of post-1991 ethnic Azeri migrants have come to Russia from rural Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia. Today most provinces of Russia have more or less significant Azeri communities, the biggest ones, according to official numbers, residing in Dagestan, Moscow, Khanty–Mansi, Krasnoyarsk, Rostov-on-the-Don, Saratov, Sverdlovsk, Samara, Stavropol, etc.
Dagestan.
As of 2010, 130,919 Azeris lived in the Dagestan Republic, which makes them the region's sixth-largest ethnic group and 4.5% of its total population. Most of them are natives of the city of Derbent living in the historical quarter Mahal and making up about one-third of the city's population. Azeris constitute 58% of the population of the Derbentsky District (more than 20 towns and villages), 18% of that of the Tabasaransky District 2.35% in the Kizlyarsky District (villages of Bolshebredikhinskoye and Persidskoye), 1.64% in the Magaramkent Rayon, and 1.56% in the Rutul Rayon. The rest live in the cities of Makhachkala, Khasavyurt, Buynaksk and Kizlyar.
Among cultural benefits, available to Dagestani Azeris, there are newspapers and magazines printed in the Azeri language, 72 public schools where Azeri is taught as a second language, and the Azeri Folk Theater in Derbent, founded in 1904. Historically Azeris of Dagestan were engaged in carpet weaving, currying, jewellery- and copper utensils making. Rural Azeris were occupied in farming. Most Azeris of Dagestan are Shia, although Sunni Muslims are found among the rural population.
In 2000, in a presidential decree, Azeris along with 13 other ethnic groups of Dagestan received the status of a native community of Dagestan. As of 2011, there are four Azeri members of the Dagestan State Council.
Beginning in 2014, the Azeri population of Derbent voiced its concern due to the government's indifference towards the poor state of infrastructure and frequent acts of vandalism and unauthorised removal of Azeri cultural landmarks in the city. These concerns led to protests and demands for a better representation at the municipal level. American political analyst Paul A. Goble characterised these events as "the boiling point" in the interethnic relations in Derbent and did not exclude the possibility of them leading to an ethnic conflict that would threaten to extend across the Russian–Azerbaijani border.
Azerbaijanis in Derbent.
After the disintegration of the Caliphate, the city of Derbent and the surrounding area (currently the Derbent Rayon) became an independent emirate closely allied with the neighbouring state of Shirvan (present day northeastern Azerbaijan). During this period, the emirate became destination for the migration of numerous Turkic tribes. This factor, as well as the influence of the Seljuq Empire, ensured the spread of an Oghuz Turkic idiom in Derbent already in the eleventh century. The Mongol invasion put an end to the emirate's independence for the next two centuries. In the fifteenth century, Ibrahim I, who hailed from Derbent, became the new ruler of Shirvan and incorporated Derbent into Shirvan.
The ethnic make-up of Derbent remained unchanged until the city became part of the Safavid Empire in the early sixteenth century. The Safavid rule was characterised with active resettlement policies, aimed at securing Shia Muslim dominance in the conquered lands. In 1509, 500 Karamanli Turkic families from Tabriz settled in Derbent. An unknown number of Turkic-speakers from the Kurchi tribe were resettled her in 1540. Half a century later, 400 more families of the Turkic-speaking Bayat clan were relocated to Derbent on the orders of Abbas I. Finally, in 1741, Nadir Shah relocated Turkic-speakers from the Mikri clan to Derbent. By 1870 the settlers were all regarded as speaking a common language, Azeri. Due to their Shia adherence, the new migrants were referred to by contemporary historians as "Persians" (), a term that was erroneously applied to Shia Azeris of Dagestan way into the twentieth century. Adam Olearius who visited the region around 1635 described Shirvan as a state of many peoples, all of whom, however, besides their own language, also spoke Turkic. At the time of Peter the Great's conquest of the Caspian coastline in 1722, the city of Derbent was predominantly inhabited by Azeris.
The northern part of the Derbent Rayon was historically populated by the Tarakama, a Turkic-speaking people akin to the Karapapak, who were sometimes classified as a separate ethnic group until the twentieth century. In Dagestan, they are also sometimes referred to as Padars. The Tarakama originated in various parts of Shirvan and were resettled by Khan Muhammad of Kaitag to the north of the city of Derbent around 1600. From then on, the area inhabited by them has been referred to as the Tarakama mahal (district) and constituted an administrative unit until the early twentieth century. The district included 10 villages. In 1736, around 300 Tarakama families from Kaitag advanced further across the Sulak River and settled on the Terek Valley in three villages, where they later mixed with the Kumyks. The rest gradually assimilated among Azerbaijanis and today for the most part consider themselves Azerbaijani. They are mainly Sunni and speak a variety of Azeri, close to the dialect of Shamakhy.
Such assimilation notably affected not only Turkic-speaking peoples of Dagestan. In the past, southern Dagestan had a large Tat population which originally spoke an Iranian language like other Tats. In 1866, they numbered 2,500 people and by 1929 lived in seven villages, including Zidyan, Bilgadi, Verkhny Chalgan, and Rukel. However, by the beginning of the twentieth century most of them had become Azeri-speaking and assumed Azeri identity in the later decades. Today, 16 out of 40 settlements in Derbent are majority-Azeri populated, and in nine more, Azeris constitute either a relative majority or a significant minority: Berikei, Delichoban, Velikent, Verkhny Chalgan, Nizhny Chalgan, Sabnova, Dzhemikent, Zidyan, Zidyan-Kazmalyar, Mitagi, Mitagi-Kazmalyar, Kala, Mugarty, Muzaim, Padar, Kommuna, Rukel, Tatlyar, Karadagly, Bilgadi, Belidzhi, Arablinsky, Arablyar, Gedzhukh, Chinar, Nyugdi, Rubas, Salik, Ullu Terekeme, Khazar, the town of Mamedkala.
Derbent was still a predominantly Azeri (called "Transcaucasian Tatars" in older Russian sources) town in 1897, with 9,767 persons constituting 66.7% of its population. Decades later, even though their numbers continued to grow, due to heavy immigration in the town, as of 2010, Azeris constituted just 32.3% of its total population with 38,523 persons.
Azerbaijanis in Tabasaran.
In the historical region of Tabasaran, ethnic Azeris populate the left bank of the Rubas river. The growth and establishment of ethnic Azeris in this region has heavily depended on assimilation processes. In 1876, many Tabasarans were already in the process of switching from Tabasaran to Azeri as their first language. In addition, from the Middle Ages, the population of a number of villages in Tabasaran, namely Arablyar, Gimeidi, Darvag, Yersi, and Kemakh consisted of ethnic Arabs who were gradually being absorbed by the neighbouring population, mainly Azeri, such as in Yersi. In 1929, Kemakh was listed among Tat-populated villages, whereas Gimeidi (abandoned in 1976) was described as mixed Tat and Azeri. These Tats, in turn, were assimilated by Azeris in the following decades. Arablyar, which is now part of the Kurakh Rayon, currently has mixed Lezgin and Azeri population. Residents of Darvag retained the knowledge of Arabic as a first language until the 1930s, after which they also integrated linguistically and ethnically into the Azeri surrounding.
Currently ethnic Azeris constitute majority in the villages of Maraga, Hili-Pendzhik (including the settlement of Yekrag), Tsanak, Arak, Yersi, Darvag, and Zil. The villages of Arkit and Khurvek, as well the district capital Khuchni are mixed Azeri and Tabasaran. Azeris of Tsanak, Arak, Yersi, and Khuchni are normally bilingual in Azeri and Tabasaran, showing preference for Tabasaran when talking to their Tabasaran neighbours even if the latter know Azeri.
Azerbaijanis in Rutul.
Nizhny Katrukh is the only Azeri village in the Rutul Rayon. Azeris of Nizhny Katrukh consider themselves descendants of the people of Shirvan who were captured by the mountaineers during one of their raids into the plains around 1700, taken to the Shamkhalate of Kazi-Kumukh (a Lak state of the time) and made subjects of the Shamkhal. According to a local legend, only two of the original seven settlers were Azeri, though it was the Azeri identity that came to dominate. The village today consists of seven quarters, populated by people of various waves of pre-Czarist immigration. Azeris of Rutul speak a distinct dialect of Azeri, which displays a heavy Lak substratum (despite general ethnic Rutul dominance in the district). The first newspaper in Rutul, "Gizil Choban", established in 1932, was printed in Azeri.
Role of the Azerbaijani language and culture.
For centuries Azeri has been the "lingua franca" of Southern Dagestan, used both to communicate with Azeris and with mountaineers whose languages were unrelated or considered unintelligible. In the sixteenth century, it became widespread in the Samur Valley and by the nineteenth century, the Azeri language spread across all of the foothill and lowland regions of Dagestan, and was one of the languages of trade and interethnic communication, along with Kumyk and Avar.
Historically the peoples of Southern Dagestan were oriented toward the cultural and behavioural norms of Azerbaijan, as well as depended on its economy. In the course of history, they found themselves almost fully immersed in the Azeri linguistic and cultural milieu. According to Dagestani anthropologist Magomedkhan Magomedkhanov, through the Azeri language, the people of this region "achieved material benefits, satisfaction of cultural needs, as well as creative and spiritual inspiration." Lezgian, Tabasaran, Rutul, and Aghul poets were creating poetry in Azeri already in the seventeenth century. Beginning in 1917, the works of Kumyk authors have displayed influences of Azeri literature. First plays in the amateur Lezgian theatre established in 1907 were performed in the Azeri language. Azeri music and singing traditions played a major role in the cultural integration of the peoples of Southern Dagestan. Music was performed through Azeri folk instruments, such as tar and kamancha and the Azeri mugham became a well-celebrated genre of music among the peoples of Dagestan. Lezgian music in particular shares many similar features with Azeri music. Azeri songs were played and performed at Tabasaran weddings as late as in the 1980s. According to Belarusian Jewish traveller Joseph Cherny, who visited the region in 1870, Mountain Jews of Dagestan had largely adopted Azeri cultural values and lifestyles, and even read liturgical prayers with a Tat translation and an Azeri tune. As for the Lezgian, Rutul, Tsakhur and other Nakh-Dagestani-speaking population, the Azeri language affected their cultural sphere and was a primary source for many loanwords, leaving their everyday speech behaviour mostly intact. The Tabasaran language is considered the most influenced by Azeri, which has contributed many nouns, adjectives, adverbs, verb forms and even auxiliary words and morphemes.
In 1861, the first secular school in Southern Dagestan opened in the Lezgian village of Akhty, and Azeri was taught there along with Russian. The learned masses preferred to use Arabic in formal communication, which is why in 1920, Arabic was chosen over the largely unwritten indigenous languages of Dagestan as a means of public education. The atheist policies of the Soviet government, however, attempted to eliminate religion from everyday life. Arabic soon became seen as a link between the Dagestanis and their Islamic heritage. Thus in 1923, Azeri became the language of education in all of Dagestan. According to Alibek Takho-Godi, Dagestani People's Commissar (minister) of Justice in the 1920s (himself of Dargwa origin), local Nakh-Dagestani languages were "not taken seriously as a means of nation-building due to their excessive number." Azeri retained its status until 1928, when education in other local languages, as well as in Russian, was introduced.
Azeri remained as the most popular second language in Southern Dagestan at least until the 1950s, spoken with various degrees of popularity as far north as in the Tindi villages of Tsumada. It is noteworthy that historically among Tindis and especially Aghuls, who lived relatively far from the Azeri settlements, usually only males spoke Azeri or any second language; and only those who visited the lowlands for seasonal labour. Beginning in the 1950s, the use of Azeri as a common second language and lingua franca has been in decline, as it could no longer compete with Russian. As of 2010, 13,648 Lezgians (2.93%), 5,665 Tabasarans (3.96%), 3,105 Avars (0.35%), and 1,379 Dargwa (0.24%) living in Russia claimed speaking Azeri, mostly as a second language (the figures in brackets indicate the percentage of the speakers of Azeri in relation to the overall ethnic population that reported language command). In Dagestan, the number of non-Azeri speakers of the Azeri language (as either a first or second language) was still in the thousands in 2010.
According to the Dagestani constitution, the official languages of Dagestan are Russian and "all local languages", though only 14 of the republic's numerous languages have writing systems, one of them being Azeri.
Rest of Russia.
Diplomatic missions and merchants from Shirvan and the Safavid Empire first appeared in Russia in the fourteenth and fifteenth century. Despite the Russian Empire conquering what is now Azerbaijan in the early nineteenth century and its incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1920, the Azeri population did not tend to leave its traditional areas of settlement until the second half of the twentieth century. However, isolated communities of Azeris in Russia can trace their existence to the mid-nineteenth century.
The population of maritime Caspian regions has historically had strong economic ties with the city of Astrakhan on the northern Caspian shore. Starting in the 1830, Azeri merchants began settling in this city, with three of them controlling up to 80% of commercial navy later in the century. Azeris, known to the local population as "Persians" or "Shamakhy Tatars", numbered around one thousand persons in 1879. Azeri oil industrialist, first-guild merchant Shamsi Asadullayev, founder of the Asadullayev Trade Affairs, built an oil base not far from Astrakhan, in a settlement presently known as Asadullayevo. The Azeri community of Astrakhan grew in the Soviet times and in 2010 consisted of 5,737 people, making Azeris the fourth largest ethnicity in the oblast and 1.31% of its total population. The religious life of the Azeris in Astrakhan is centred around the 1909 Kriushi Mosque, which was closed down in 1932, and recently reopened and renovated as a Shiite mosque and named the Baku Mosque (by virtue of being located on Baku Street). The Azeri language is taught as a subject at the Astrakhan State University.
Shamsi Asadullayev was based in Moscow from 1903 until his death in 1913. He allocated money for the construction of a secular school for Muslim boys and girls and a Muslim community centre in Moscow. The four-story building erected after his death on Maly Tatarsky Lane came to be known as the Asadullayev House. It is currently owned by the Tatar National Cultural Autonomy of Moscow.
Similarly to all Muslims of the Caucasus and Central Asia, Azeris were exempt from compulsory military service in the Russian Imperial army, but were required to pay a special tax. Those willing to serve were allowed to enlist in irregular units, such as the Savage Division. At the same time, there was no restriction for Azeris (and other Muslim subjects of the Russian Empire) to be trained as officers. In 1805, Mammad Hasan agha Javanshir became one of the first Russian major generals of Azeri origin. Ethnic Azeri officers commanded Russian troops in a series of wars, including the Russo-Persian wars of 1804–1813 and 1826–1828, Russo-Turkish wars of 1828–1829 and 1877–1878, the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Crimean War, the Caucasian War, and the Russian conquest of Central Asia.
In 1905, Azeri political figures were among those who established the first Islamic party of Russia, Ittifaq al-Muslimin, in the city of Nizhny Novgorod. An Azeri member, lawyer Alimardan Topchubashov, was elected its leader. The party was officially registered in 1908. There were six ethnic Azeris elected in the State Duma of the Russian Empire in the 1906 Russian legislative election, six more in the February 1907 election and one in each of the following elections.
In the decades following World War II, Azeris have played significant a role in developing Russian economy. Azerbaijani geologist Farman Salmanov, who later established himself in Moscow, discovered rich oil reserves in Siberia which had previously been considered as an unlikely oil-bearing region. Surgut International Airport, the third busiest airport in Western Siberia, is was renamed after Salmanov following online voting. With many of them involved in entrepreneurship, Azeris have been employed in major economical areas, such as trade and oil industry. Among Russia's 100 richest people ranked by "Forbes" in 2004, three ethnic Azeris were ranked 10, 66 and 74.
Azeris have established numerous cultural communities, the largest one being the All-Russian Azeri Congress and the Azeri Federal National Culture Autonomy, which control smaller communities across Russia. In addition, the Moscow Public Secondary School No. 157 is set up for students with keen interest in the Azeri language and culture.
A 2005 study indicated noticeable social differences between two groups of Azeris: those who are native to or have lived considerable parts of their lives in Moscow and those who are recent immigrants. About half of the people in the first group have a post-secondary degree, whereas among immigrant Azeris only 25% do. Fluency in the Russian language is characteristic of virtually all of those in the first group (moreover, 24% of Azeris from this group reported it as their first language), while almost one-third of those in the second group speak very limited Russian. About half of Azeri newcomers are engaged in commerce and service sector, compared to the native and earlier immigrant Azeris who tend to pursue careers in sciences, health care, education and the arts.
In general, among ethnic Caucasus diasporas in Moscow, Azeris stand out as the least integrated into Russian society. They have been described as the strongest adherents to their traditions and marriages within their own ethnic community compared to local Armenians, Georgians, Ukrainians, and Tatars. According to a 2006 survey, 71% of Moscow Azeris described themselves as being religious. A great number of them have retained Azerbaijani citizenship and is willing to relocate back to Azerbaijan at some point. The 2010 Russian census saw a decrease in the number of Azeris in Russia compared to the previous census, with 603,070 Azeris (with 21.7% of them in Dagestan) compared to 621,840 in 2002 (with 18% in Dagestan). Over 97% of Azeris living in Russia know the Russian language. Close to 84% considers Azeri their first language. Among Azeris of Dagestan, the number of speakers of Azeri as a first language is over 99%.
Discrimination.
Azeris in the Russian Federation have faced discrimination, although racial conflict has had a rapid decline since 2008.
On 29 June 2025, Azerbaijan's Ministry of Culture canceled all Russian-related cultural events nationwide in response to the deaths of two Azerbaijanis in police custody in Yekaterinburg.

Manibhai Desai

Manibhai Bhimbhai Desai (27 April 1920 – 14 November 1993) was an Indian social activist, associate of Mahatma Gandhi, and a pioneer of rural development.
Early life.
Manibhai Desai was born to Ramiben and Bhimbhai Desai, on April 27, 1920, in the village of Kosmada, Surat District, Bombay presidency (now in State of Gujarat), British India. His father, Bhimbhai, was a well-to-do farmer and respected leader among the farmers of the 10 or 15 villages in the area. The couple had five boys and one daughter.
When Bhimbhai died in 1927, the eldest son took charge of the ancestral farm while the next two sons pursued careers in the textile industry, one becoming a gold medal spinner and the other an expert weaver and the general manager of one of India's largest textile units.
At the time of his father's death Manibhai was in first grade at the elementary school in his native village. For the five years he attended that school (1927-1931) he ranked first in his class; he was also good in sports and a leader in the Boy Scouts. India in these years was being shaken by Mahatma Gandhi's civil disobedience against British rule. Desai credited an incident that happened when he was ten that influenced his future life. A young man from the village, Narottambhai Patel, joined Gandhi on his march from Ahmadabad to Dandi where the demonstrators raided the salt stocks as a protest against the imposition of a salt tax. It was Patel's duty on his return to the village, to see that a pinch of salt, which had become a symbol of the struggle for independence, was distributed to each household. He chose young Manibhai to carry out the task. Deeply moved by the sight of villagers bowing down as they ate the salt, Manibhai felt at age 10 the call of Mahatma Gandhi. Later Manibhai attended high school in Surat. Since his family wanted him to pursue a career in Engineering, young Manibhai selected Physics and Mathematics for his undergraduate studies. However, in his final year of Manibhai's study, Gandhi started the Quit India movement against the British rule that Manibhai joined and was even imprisioned by British
Career.
After graduation Manibhai joined Mahatma Gandhi in the independence struggle. Mahatma Gandhi stayed in the village of Uruli Kanchan near the city of Pune in 1946. At that time Gandhi had lost trust in western medicine and wanted to explore Nature therapy. For this purpose he nominated Manibhai as the manager of the newly established Nature therapy Ashram at Urali. The young Manibhai gave a pledge to Mahatma Gandhi to devote his life to uplifting of Uruli. His first major activity there was to manage the Nature cure Ashram which continues to this day and is well known throughout India. The Nature cure therapy at the ashram followed guidelines issued by Gandhiji. They included regulation of diet, fast, sun-bath, fomentations, steam-bath, mud- bandage, massage and non-injurious indigenous herbs. Manibhai followed this by opening a high school in Uruli. Although Gandhian principles were central to Manibhai's work, he believed the rural poor can benefit from scientific advances During his work at the Nature cure ashram, Manibhai self-taught himself aspects of horticulture and cattle breeding. To take this to next stage, he founded the NGO Bharatiya Agro-Industries Foundation (BAIF) in 1967. BAIF has been a pioneer in cross breeding of high yielding European cattle such as Holstein Freisian and 
Jersey with the sturdy Indian breeds such as Gir from Gujarat. During this period Manibhai visited numerous countries around the world such as Denmark, Great Britain, United States, Canada and Israel to learn about cattle breeding, farming techniques and to raise funds. Indian politicians at the highest level used to visit Urali to see for themselves the cow breeding activities. Later Manibhai expanded the scope of activities for BAIF to include animal health, nutrition, afforestation wasteland development, and tribal development.
Although Manibhai did not pursue high political office, he served as the Sarpanch Council chjief) of Uruli Kanchan Gram panchayat (village council) for many years. He also served on the board of Yeshwant sahakari sakhar karkhana (Yeshwant cooperative sugar mill) at nearby village of Theur for many years.
Awards and honours.
In 1968, the Indian government honoured Manibhai with the Padmashree award. In 1982, Manibhai accepted the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service. In 1983, he received the Jamnalal Bajaj Award for Gandhian values, community values and social development.
Death and legacy.
Manibhai died on 14 November 1993 at Pune. The institutes he established have continued and prospered.
"ManiBhai is a revered figure for people in Village of Dulba, District Patiala, Punjab.His birthday every year is marked by celebrations and by paying respect and thanking him for his work in rural areas.

Pristerognathus Assemblage Zone

The "Pristerognathus" Assemblage Zone is a tetrapod assemblage zone or biozone which correlates to the upper Abrahamskraal Formation and lowermost Teekloof Formation, Adelaide Subgroup of the Beaufort Group, a fossiliferous and geologically important geological Group of the Karoo Supergroup in South Africa. The thickest outcrops, reaching not more than , occur just east of Sutherland through to Beaufort West in the south and Victoria West in the north. Exposures are also found west of Colesberg and south of Graaff-Reinet. The "Pristerognathus" Assemblage Zone is the third biozone of the Beaufort Group.
The name of the biozone refers to "Pristerognathus polyodon", a medium-sized carnivorous therocephalian therapsid. It is characterized by the presence of this therocephalian species in association with "Diictodon feliceps", a small, fossorial dicynodont whose fossils are especially common in this biozone.
History.
The first fossils to be found in the Beaufort Group rocks that encompass the current eight biozones were discovered by Andrew Geddes Bain in 1856. However, it was not until 1892 that it was observed that the geological strata of the Beaufort Group could be differentiated based on their fossil taxa. The initial undertaking was done by Harry Govier Seeley who subdivided the Beaufort Group into three biozones, which he named (from oldest to youngest):
These proposed biozones Seeley named were subdivided further by Robert Broom between 1906 and 1909. Broom proposed the following biozones (from oldest to youngest):
The "Pristerognathus" Assemblage Zone as it currently stands was defined by Keyser and Smith in the late 1970s. Initially the biozone included the upper 300m of the underlying "Tapinocephalus" Assemblage Zone due to the disappearance of Dinocephalian fossils in those rock deposits and had been named the "Pristerognathus-Diictodon" Assemblage Zone. After further research on the rocks of the middle Permian, it was understood that the disappearance of the dinocephalians was not an indication of the boundary of the "Tapinocephalus" Assemblage Zone, and the extra 300m of rock was subsequently restored to the underlying Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone.
Lithology.
The "Pristerognathus" Assemblage Zone correlates with the upper Abrahamskraal Formation, the lowermost Teekloof Formation west of 24°E and to the Middleton Formation east of 24°E, Adelaide Subgroup of the Beaufort Group. This biozone is considered to be Middle Permian (Guadalupian) in age.
The rocks of the "Pristerognathus" Assemblage Zone are similar to the underlying "Tapinocephalus" Assemblage Zone although is dominated by multistory sandstone deposits. The sandstones are interspaced with silt-rich greenish-grey mudstones and subordinate reddish-brown mudstone layers. Calcareous nodules, which weather out brown, are often found in the mudstone layers. Pinkish chert bands are found in the lowermost mudstone deposits of this biozone. The "Pristerognathus" Assemblage Zone is also known for containing uranium deposits. The presence of the chert band confirms that there was volcanic activity taking place during the time the rock sediments were deposited. The rocks of the lower "Pristerognathus" Assemblage Zone were deposited at the end of the middle Permian (end-Guadalupian) extinction event, which is currently thought to have been caused by the eruption of the Emeishan Large Igneous Province.
The depositional environment of the "Pristerognathus" Assemblage Zone was likewise similar to the "Tapinocephalus" Assemblage Zone, having been formed by sedimentary material being deposited by vast, fluvial plains. These fluvial plains flowed northwards from a foreland basin that was being formed from the rising of the Gondwanide mountains in the south. The Gondwanides were the result of crustal uplift that had previously begun to take course due to tectonic activity. The pressure of the growing Gondwanides mountain chain caused the formation of the Karoo Basin where the deposits of the "Pristerognathus" Assemblage zone, and all other succeeding assemblage zone deposits, were deposited over tens of millions of years.
Paleontology.
Vertebrate fossils are most commonly found in the mudstone deposits of the "Pristerognathus" Assemblage Zone, especially within the calcareous nodules. This biozone is characterized by the presence of "Pristerognathus polyodon" and its other subspecies "Pristerognathus baini" and "Pristerognathus vanderbyli". "Pristerognathus" fossils are usually found associated with those of "Diictodon". The fossils of both these taxa are the most commonly found; other fossil taxa are markedly more rare. Species diversity dropped off after the end-Guadalupian extinction, which is the reason that this biozone is lacking in species richness. Other taxa that have been found in this biozone include a couple pareiasaur species, namely "Bradysaurus", the putative pantestudine "Eunotosaurus africanus", and the varanopid pelycosaur "Heleosaurus scholtzi". Fossils of the biarmosuchian "Hipposaurus boonstrai" are likewise found including some gorgonopsid species. Other dicynodont species found include "Endothiodon uniseries" and "Pristerodon mackayi". Finally, fossils of temnospondyl amphibians such as of "Rhinesuchus whaitsi", the fishes "Namaichthys" and "Atherstonia", invertebrate trackways, burrows, and feeding trails such as of Planolites and a variety of plant fossils, namely of "Glossopteris", "Phyllotheca", and "Schizoneura", have been recovered. Some fossil taxa that have been found from this biozone, namely "Hipposaurus", have been recovered from geological formations from different countries which correlate in age. Hipposaurus fossils have been found in the Madumabisa Mudstone Formation in Zambia.

Luigi Bertolini

Luigi Bertolini (; 13 September 1904 – 11 February 1977) was an Italian footballer who played as a midfielder.
Club career.
Born in Busalla, province of Genoa, Bertolini played in the 1920s for Savona, Alessandria and Juventus. He moved from Alessandria to Juventus in 1931, becoming an integral part of the remainder of their five-year championship run. In total, he played 137 matches for Juventus, scoring five goals, helping the team to win four Serie A tournaments. He retired from playing football in 1940.
International career.
With the Italy national football team, Bertolini made his debut in 1929, and was a member of the teams that was runner-up at the 1931-32 Central European International Cup &amp; winner at the 1933–35 Central European International Cup but most notably he was also a member of the team that won the 1934 FIFA World Cup. Alongside Luisito Monti and Attilio Ferraris, Luigi Bertolini made up the legendary Italian midfield established at the 1934 World Cup. In that tournament he started every game and was only rested by Pozzo in the first quarter-final encounter against Spain. Bertolini is very recognisable in the photos of the 1934 Italian World Cup-winning team by virtue of his big white bandana which he used to protect his head from the seams of the ball when attempting headers. He was also one of the 'Lions of Highbury' in the narrow loss to England in November 1934 known as the Battle of Highbury. As the story goes, during the second half he was disoriented from fatigue and with the English constantly in attack, he kept calling out for Luisito not realising that Monti was not on the field (due to a broken bone) and the midline was just himself and Ferraris.
Managerial career.
Following his retirement, Bertolini began his coaching career with Tigullia in 1938.

Chetpet (Chennai)

Chetpet is a neighbourhood in the Indian city of Chennai It is served by the Chetpet railway station in the Beach–Tambaram line of Chennai Suburban Railway. Chetpet has a pond between the Chetpet railway station and the Poonamallee High Road, one of the last surviving natural water bodies in the city. It is the locality in Chennai where the mathematician Ramanujan died.
It has a bridge and two subways (Harrington Road and East Spur Tank Road) that provide a way to cross the railway surrounding all 3 sides.
History.
Along with Egmore and Nungambakkam, Chetpet is considered one of the original villages merged by the British to form Chennai.
McNichols Road existed in 1798 as an avenued highway for the greater part of its course from Spur Tank Road towards Poonamallee High Road. It derives its name from Robert McNichol who was Assistant Master Attendant between 1811 and 1822.
Spur Tank.
The Spur Tank was a tank which was present in the southern skirt of EVR Periyar Road (Poonamalee High Road) in the Chetpet area. The tank was slowly encroached upon by 1939 and eventually was completely silted up. The name likely comes due to its "spur-like" shape.
The nearby Spur Tank Road (or Mayor Ramanathan Salai) was named after the tank. The first mention of the Spur Tank was in 1718 by Henry Davidson Love in his "Vestiges Of Old Madras." The oldest available map on the internet (1854) indicates the Spur Tank more as a rectangular water body.
The Asiatic Annual Register, Vol. X, published in 1811, refers to the arrival and settling in of Thomas Andrew Strange, who was to become the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. This note mentions that Strange met several officials belonging to the Madras administration at the Chief Justice’s garden on the Spur Tank, at 9 o’clock on July 12, 1808.
Although some lamented on the shrinking of the Spur Tank in 1939, Some refer to deliberate filling of tanks, including the Spur Tank because of the high amount of mosquitos present there.
Today, there is little to no evidence of the existence of a tank as most of it has been silted up and replaced with subways and playgrounds.
Development.
Until recently, the waters of Chetpet lake supplied groundwater recharge for the surrounding neighbourhoods.
Location – Chetpet.
Chetpet is located at the center of Chennai, with a suburban station of its own,not far from Chennai Egmore Railway Station. CMBT is 8 km from Chetpet.
Chetpet Eco Park is a famous landmark in this locality. The Karukatthaman Koil is one of the temples in the locality inaugurated on July 12, 1924.

Dakota Johnson

Dakota Mayi Johnson (born October 4, 1989) is an American actress. Her accolades include a nomination for a British Academy Film Award.
The daughter of actors Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, Johnson made her film debut at age ten with a minor role in "Crazy in Alabama" (1999), directed by her then-stepfather Antonio Banderas, and also starring her mother. After graduating from high school, she began auditioning for roles and had a minor part in "The Social Network" (2010). Johnson had her breakthrough playing the lead role in the erotic "Fifty Shades" film series (2015–2018). In 2016, she received a BAFTA Rising Star Award nomination and was featured in a "Forbes" 30 Under 30 list.
Johnson's profile grew with roles in the crime drama "Black Mass" (2015), the drama "A Bigger Splash" (2015), the romantic comedy "How to Be Single" (2016), the horror film "Suspiria" (2018), the thriller "Bad Times at the El Royale" (2018), the coming-of-age film "The Peanut Butter Falcon" (2019), the psychological drama "The Lost Daughter" (2021), the romantic drama "Cha Cha Real Smooth" (2022), and the romantic film "Materialists" (2025).
Early life.
Dakota Mayi Johnson was born on October 4, 1989, in Austin, Texas, to actors Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith. Her father was shooting the film "The Hot Spot" (1990) in Texas when she was born. Her maternal grandparents are advertising executive and former child actor Peter Griffith, and actress Tippi Hedren. She is a half-niece of actress Tracy Griffith and production designer Clay A. Griffith. Actor Antonio Banderas is her former stepfather. Johnson has a complex family as each of her parents had children by three different people. Her six half-siblings are: Jesse Johnson (b. 1982), from her father's relationship with Patti D'Arbanville; Alexander Bauer (b. 1985), from her mother's marriage to Steven Bauer; Stella Banderas (b. 1996), from her mother's marriage to Antonio; Grace (b. 1999), Jasper (b. 2002), and Deacon Johnson (b. 2006), from her father's marriage to Kelley Phleger.
Owing to her parents' occupations, Johnson spent much of her childhood in their various filming locations and accompanying them to premieres, though she spent time in Aspen and Woody Creek, Colorado, where, in her teen years, she worked summers at the local market. In Woody Creek, she was neighbors with Hunter S. Thompson. She attended the Aspen Community School for a time. "I was so consistently unmoored and discombobulated, I didn't have an anchor anywhere," Johnson recalled. She attended the Santa Catalina School in Monterey, California, for her freshman year of high school before transferring to the private New Roads School in Santa Monica, California.
Johnson became interested in modeling at age 12 after participating in a photo shoot with other celebrities' children for "Teen Vogue." She subsequently earned an income modeling while attending high school in Santa Monica. She has struggled with depression since around age 14 and checked into rehabilitation. Even as a child, Johnson was interested in acting, having spent significant time on film sets with her parents, but they discouraged her from pursuing the profession until she graduated high school. After reaching that milestone, she applied to Juilliard School, performing in her audition monologues by Shakespeare and Steve Martin, but was not accepted.
Career.
1999–2014: Beginnings.
In 1999, Johnson made her film debut in "Crazy in Alabama", where she and her half-sister Stella Banderas played daughters to their real-life mother, Melanie Griffith. The film was directed by Antonio Banderas and was based on the 1993 novel by Mark Childress. In 2006, she was chosen as Miss Golden Globe, where she served as the first second-generation Miss Golden Globe in the Globes' history.
That same year, Johnson signed with IMG Models. Though acting is her primary work, she has since modeled for MANGO brand's jeans line in 2009 and shot the "Rising Star" campaign for Australian fashion label Wish in 2011.
After graduating from high school, Johnson took acting classes with teacher Tom Todoroff until 2008. She signed with the William Morris Agency and started her acting career. She had a minor role in David Fincher's biographical film "The Social Network" (2010). She had a small role in the fantasy film "Beastly" (2011). Johnson starred in So Yong Kim's drama "For Ellen" (2012), alongside Paul Dano and Jon Heder. The film is about a struggling musician in the midst of a custody battle. Also in 2012, she played a student at a prep school in Christopher Neil's independent comedy "Goats". Johnson starred in Nicholas Stoller's romance film "The Five-Year Engagement" and the comedy "21 Jump Street". She had a leading role for Chris Nelson's film "Date and Switch".
In March 2012, Johnson had a leading role in the Fox comedy television series "Ben and Kate". It was canceled on January 25, 2013, after one season. Johnson continued acting in films, with a small role in "Need for Speed" (2014). In 2013, she had a role as one of the new hires on the series finale episode of the NBC comedy series "The Office".
2015–2019: Breakthrough.
Johnson's breakthrough came with her leading role as Anastasia "Ana" Steele in the erotic romantic drama film "Fifty Shades of Grey", which was released in February 2015 and brought her international recognition. Johnson won the role over Lucy Hale, Felicity Jones, Elizabeth Olsen, Danielle Panabaker, and Shailene Woodley. In response to questions regarding her stance on gender rights concerning her character in the "Fifty Shades" film series, Johnson stated: "I'm proud of [the film]. I completely disagree with people who think Ana's weak. I think she's actually stronger than "he" is. Everything she does is her choice. And if I can be an advocate for women to do what they want to do with their bodies and not be ashamed of what they want, then I'm all for that." While the trilogy was widely criticized, Johnson received praise for often being the standout performer. However, her role in the first film won her first Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress, as well as an Award for Worst Screen Combo, which she shared alongside Jamie Dornan. She received nominations in the same categories for "Fifty Shades Darker" (2017), though she did not win. She would reprise her role for the trilogy's final film, "Fifty Shades Freed" (2018).
On February 15, 2015, Johnson appeared on "Saturday Night Live"s 40th anniversary special and hosted "SNL" on February 28, 2015, making her the second daughter of a former "SNL" host (after Gwyneth Paltrow, whose mother Blythe Danner hosted during the show's seventh season in 1982) to host the show. Also in 2015, she reunited with her "21 Jump Street" cast member Johnny Depp, playing the mother of his character's child in the feature film "Black Mass". Jessica Kiang of IndieWire said that she "makes something of nothing" in her role. In 2015, Johnson starred in Luca Guadagnino's thriller "A Bigger Splash", alongside Tilda Swinton, Matthias Schoenaerts, and Ralph Fiennes. Writing for "Rolling Stone", Peter Travers stated that Johnson showed that her character "has more on her mind than slithering seductively". According to Christy Lemire from "RogerEbert.com": ""A Bigger Splash" allows Johnson to be both funnier and sexier than she was in "Fifty Shades of Grey"". The same year saw the release of "Cymbeline", a modern film adaptation of the William Shakespeare play, in which she starred alongside Ethan Hawke and Ed Harris. She also played a lead in the 2016 comedy "How to Be Single", with Leslie Mann and her "Date and Switch" co-star Nicholas Braun. She performed a cover of the song "Can't Take My Eyes Off of You", alongside Zani Jones Mbayise, Vanessa Rubio and Damon Wayans Jr. for the soundtrack of the film. Johnson was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in June 2016.
Johnson starred in Luca Guadagnino's supernatural horror film "Suspiria" (2018), a remake of the 1977 film, in which she played an American dancer in Berlin who enrolls in an academy run by a coven of witches. David Ehrlich of IndieWire described Johnson's performance in the film as "thrillingly unrepentant". Also in 2018, she starred in Drew Goddard's neo-noir thriller "Bad Times at the El Royale", with Jeff Bridges, Jon Hamm, and Chris Hemsworth. In the film, she played a hippie staying at a resort on the California-Nevada border where the lives of various people with suspicious pasts intersect. "Screen Rant" ranked Johnson's performance as the fourth-best in the film and stated that "she brings a reserved, under-the-surface power to her role".
In 2019, Johnson starred opposite Armie Hammer in Babak Anvari's psychological horror film "Wounds", which is based on Nathan Ballingrud's horror novella "The Visible Filth". It had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2019. Johnson starred in the well-reviewed independent adventure film "The Peanut Butter Falcon", alongside Shia LaBeouf, Zack Gottsagen, and Bruce Dern. The film premiered at South by Southwest on March 9, 2019. It became the highest grossing independent film of the year. She starred in Gabriela Cowperthwaite's drama film "Our Friend", alongside Casey Affleck and Jason Segel. The film is based upon real life couple Nicole and Matthew Teague, faced with Nicole's impending death, see their best friend move in with them to help them out. She sang on three covers of songs for the film's soundtrack, including one of "If I Had the World to Give" by Grateful Dead. Joe Morgenstern of "The Wall Street Journal" wrote that the "intimacy of Ms. Johnson's performance is extraordinary. She is the least assertive of movie stars, yet the courage, despair and fury she finds in Nicole will lift you up and spin you around". While Gary Goldstein from the "Los Angeles Times" stated that Johnson "impresses with affecting range — from flirty, ebullient and adoring to stalwart, enraged and resigned; it's a lovely performance".
2020–present.
Johnson founded the production company TeaTime Pictures, alongside former Netflix development executive Ro Donnelly, to develop films and television series. In 2020, Johnson made her directorial debut, co-directing (with Cory Bailey) the music video for Coldplay's "Cry Cry Cry", which featured her boyfriend Chris Martin. Johnson starred alongside Tracee Ellis Ross in the dramedy film "The High Note", which was released on May 29, 2020. Ann Hornaday of "The Washington Post" wrote that "she's lovely to look at and can never be accused of overacting, but in terms of conveying single-minded drive, Johnson is no match for [Tracee Ellis] Ross's carefully calibrated tonal swings between imperiousness, self-awareness, isolation and down-to-earth intimacy." Conversely Richard Roeper of the "Chicago Sun Times" saw it as "maybe her best and certainly most lovable performance."
In 2021, she co-starred in "The Lost Daughter", directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal and based on Elena Ferrante's novel of the same name. In December 2021, Boat Rocker Media acquired a minority interest for TeaTime Pictures. In 2022, she starred in the Netflix film adaptation of author Jane Austen's "Persuasion". Johnson co-produced and starred in several films. She played a lesbian in "Am I Ok?", which was directed by Stephanie Allynne and Tig Notaro. She played a young mother with an autistic child in "Cha Cha Real Smooth", in which she starred opposite Cooper Raiff. Johnson played a cab passenger who has an emotionally profound interaction with a cabbie in the film "Daddio", in which she starred opposite Sean Penn. Her performances in "The Lost Daughter", "Persuasion", "Cha Cha Real Smooth", and "Daddio" were met with positive reception from critics and audiences.
In November 2023, Johnson departed WME and signed a representation deal with Creative Artists Agency. She played the title role in the superhero film "Madame Web" (2024), set in Sony's Spider-Man Universe. It was produced on a budget of $80 million and was critically and commercially unsuccessful, earning her a second Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress. Speaking about the film's failure, Johnson went on to say "We don’t have control over how something turns out. (I) signed on to a movie that, by the end of shooting it, (was) a completely different script than what I attached to, and that is a crazy journey to go on as an artist. Because you’re like, ‘OK, I’m doing something with my actual body and my actual mind and my heart and my emotions,’ and it’s just being taken and fucked with, but you can’t do anything about it. Like, what am I going to do, fucking cry about "Madame Web"? No. I’m gonna laugh."
In 2025, she took a supporting role in the comedy "Splitsville" which she also served as a producer. That same year she took a leading role in the Celine Song directed romance "Materialists" (2025) co-starring opposite Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal.
Personal life.
Johnson was previously involved in long-term relationships with musician Noah Gersh and actor Jordan Masterson. She dated Matthew Hitt, the lead vocalist of Welsh indie rock band Drowners, intermittently for almost two years until 2016. She had been in a relationship with Coldplay's vocalist Chris Martin since October 2017. They resided together in Malibu, California and were engaged. It was reported in June 2025 that the couple split up after eight years of dating.
Johnson is a tattoo enthusiast and has been named a brand ambassador for luxury fashion brand Gucci. In November 2020, it was announced that she had become an investor and co-creative director of Maude, a sexual wellness brand. In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the Time's Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination.
Johnson is an avid reader. She launched a book club in March 2024.
Awards and nominations.
Among her accolades, Johnson received the Robert Altman Award from the Independent Spirit Awards as a part of the ensemble for "Suspiria". For her role in the "Fifty Shades" film series, she received a People's Choice Award, as well as nomination for two MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards. She was nominated for BAFTA Rising Star Award in 2016.

<doc id="7000819" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7000819" title="Mogami Yoshiaki">
Mogami Yoshiaki

 was a "daimyō" of the Yamagata Domain in Dewa Province, in the late Sengoku and early Edo periods. He was known as the "Fox of Dewa".
His younger sister, Yoshihime, later became the wife of Date Terumune and gave birth to Masamune, making him the uncle of Date Masamune.
It was recorded in historical documents that his height was over 180 cm.
Biography.
Early life.
Mogami Yoshiaki was born on the first day of the first month of the Tenbun era (1546) to his father, Yoshimori, and his mother, Nagaura. His birth name was Hakujumaru and he succeeded his father as "daimyō" of Yamagata Prefecture. The Mogami clan which he hailed from has a prestigious bloodline that descended from the Shiba clan, a branch of Ashikaga clan, and the "Yoshi" character of his name "Yoshiaki" was bestowed directly by the 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru. Furthermore, the Mogami clan was in the position as direct vassals of the Ashikaga shogunate. As a boy who was raised in a samurai and aristocratic clan, Yoshiaki had the literary ability to compose letters over three meters long and was able to enjoy renga in Kyoto alongside famous renga poets such as Satomura Shōha.
On June 14, 1563 (Eiroku 6), Yoshiaki, aged 17, and his father went to Kyoto to have an audience with Shogun Yoshiteru and present him with a horse and a sword.
In 1564, when his sister Yoshihime married Date Terumune, the Mogami clan became allied with the Date clan. At some point during this period, the Mogami clan underwent a succession conflict.
In 1570, at the age of 25, Yoshiaki inherited the clan leadership from his father and set upon his goal of reviving the hereditary position of his clan as "Oshu Tandai" (Overseer of Dewa Province, the areas of which encompass modern-day Akita and Yamagata prefectures). He expanded not only into the northern and western parts of Yamagata Prefecture, but also into the southern part of Akita Prefecture.
Due to the confusion over the succession of the Mogami clan, local lords in the Dewa Province, such as Tendo Yorisada, and his clan members Higashine Yorichage, Kaminoyama Mitsukane, and Shiratori Nagahisa, tried to become independent. Yoshiaki, who inherited the family headship, used fairly forceful methods to suppress their attempts to declare independence from the Mogami clan. Mogami had Kaminoyama's vassal Satomi Minbu betray and kill him. Mogami also had Higashine's vassal Satomi Kageyori betray and kill him. Having destroyed the unity of the Tendo family, Yoshiaki exiled Tendo Yorisada's son Yorimizu, who had succeeded him after his death.
Unification of Dewa province.
In 1571, Mogami Yoshiaki officially became the head of the Mogami clan. During this time, Yoshihime sent information about the Date clan to Yoshiaki, her and Yoshiaki's actions made the Date clan distrust the Mogami family. Yoshiaki fought against the Date clan twice in different years, 1574 and 1578, in both battles Yoshihime advanced to the middle of the battlefield to create a peace treaty. Yoshiaki married a woman from the Osaki clan of the Mutsu province, who was his relative. When Date later attacked the Osaki clan the relationship between Yoshimitsu and Date Masamune deteriorated.
In 1580, he got help from Satomi Minbu allowing him to successfully take over the Kaminoyama Castle which lead to Kaminoyama Mitsukane committing suicide.
In 1581, he expanded his power to Murayama District and took over Oguni Castle. Yoshiaki also attacked Sakenobe Castle and forced Sakenobe Hidetsuna to surrender. Later, Hidetsuna became Yoshiaki's chief vassal. In 1583, he expanded the Semboku areas, and threatened Daihōji Yoshiuji. Daihōji declared war against the Mogami clan as result. Later, Yoshiuji was defeated and committed suicide.
In 1584, Yoshiaki defeated the Sagae clan which was led by Sagae Takamoto who committed suicide. Yoshiaki then attacked the Tendo clan, who were based in Tendo, just north of Yamagata, into Kokubu (present-day Miyagi Prefecture), led by Tendō Yorizumi. Later, Yorizumi fled to the territory of Kokubun Morishige, causing the Tendō clan to collapse. Furthermore, he also defeated the Shiratori clan within the same area.
Meanwhile, in Dewa Province, one of the remaining local lords in conflict with Yoshiaki was Nagahisa Shiratori. Nagahisa Shiratori's territory was in Murayama County, Dewa Province, near present-day Murayama, Yamagata. He was an obstacle to Yoshiaki, who was trying to pacify Dewa, but he also had connections with Oda Nobunaga and was plotting to obtain the title of "Dewa no Kami" (Lord of Dewa). Yoshiaki, who had read of these developments, invited Shiratori Nagahisa to his castle, Yamagata Castle, in 1584, claiming to be seriously ill. According to the "Tale of Mogami Yoshiaki" written in the early Edo period, Yoshiaki, who was bedridden, asked Shiratori Nagahisa to "serve as guardian until my eldest son, Yoshiyasu, comes of age," and handed him a family tree that had been passed down from his ancestors. It is recorded that when Shiratori Nagahisa was about to receive the family tree document, Yoshiaki suddenly killed him with a sword that he had hidden. With the elimination of Nagahisa, the Mogami clan finally asserted their dominance of the region. It was reported that the assassination of Nagahisa was ordered by Oda Nobunaga several years prior, before the Honnō-ji Incident in 1582, when Nagahisa enraged Nobunaga by lying to Nobunaga claiming that he was the ruler of Dewa province.
In 1586, Yoshiaki fought against Onodera Yoshimichi. Yoshiaki's eldest son, Mogami Yoshiyasu and Tateoka Mitsushige succeeded in defeating the Onodera reinforcements. In October, Yoshiaki crossed the Rokuji Highway and invaded Shōnai in an effort to reinforce Tōzenji Yoshinaga, lord of Tozenji Castle, against the attack of his enemy, Daihōji Yoshioki. Yoshioki was defeated in battle the same month and committed suicide, causing the Daihōji clan to go extinct. In 1587, he succeeded in taking control of Shonai (western Yamagata prefecture). However, his nephew, Date Masamune, was also expanding his own ambitions at the same time, and he was targeting domains within the Mogami clan.
Conflict with Date Masamune.
In 1588, an internal conflict broke out within the Osaki clan, the former "Oshu Tandai", protector of Oshu region, with the Mogami and Date clans, who had each requested reinforcements, entered into a state of war. This conflict was brought to a peace agreement through the desperate pleas of his younger sister, Yoshihime, but while they were distracted by the conflict with the Date clan, Honjo Shigenaga, a subordinate of the Uesugi clan from Echigo Province, took over Shonai. In response to this, Yoshiaki sought to recapture the region from the Uesugi clan. However, when Toyotomi Hideyoshi came to power In 1590, he forbade any private wars among daimyo or feudal lords in Japan. Yoshiaki then submitted to Hideyoshi's authority. In the same year, Yoshiaki was given about 200,000 koku by Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
In 1589, on May, Tokugawa Ieyasu sent a letter to Katakura Kagetsuna, imploring him that Date Masamune reconcile with Yoshiaki.
Incident of Yoshiaki daughter.
In 1591, after the Siege of Odawara, he participated in the Kunohe Rebellion. During this time, Toyotomi Hidetsugu, who had been chosen as Toyotomi Hideyoshi's successor, fell in love with Yoshiaki's daughter, Komahime, and married her, and Yoshiaki became an important Toyotomi daimyo as because of his relation to the Toyotomi clan. In 1591, Yoshiaki was allowed to use the surname of Toyotomi, and usually called himself Hashiba Yoshiaki. Although he did not end up sailing to Korea during the Bunroku Invasion, in 1592, he went to Nagoya Castle in Hizen with 500 of his retainers to prepare for passage to Korea.
In July 1595, an incident occurred which involved his daughter, who had been betrothed to Hidetsugu. This incident was triggered by the birth of Hideyori, a male heir, to Hideyoshi's second wife Yodo-dono. This resulted in Hidetsugu being accused of treason and forced to commit seppuku at Mount Kōya on the order of Hideyoshi, presumably to secure the inheritance of Hideyori. Besides Hidetsugu, Hideyoshi also killed Hidetsugu's wife, concubines, and children, who were also executed at Sanjogawara. Yoshiaki's daughter, Komahime, who was only 15 years old had recently married Hidetsugu, was also executed as a result. Yoshiaki begged for her life but was refused. Komahime was beheaded along with Hidetsugu's other wives and concubines, and her body was dumped in the Sanjogawara River on August 2 of the same year. Furthermore, Yoshiaki was suspected of participating in Hidetsugu's rebellion, but he was pardoned with the assistance of Tokugawa Ieyasu's intercession on his behalf. As result of the execution of Komahime, Yoshiaki's wife Osaki-dono was struck with deep grief by the sudden death of her daughter, and she died on August 16. After this incident, Yoshiaki grew closer to Ieyasu and became his strongest supporter.
In 1597, Yoshiaki's son Yoshiyasu was eventually given the official title of Shūri-daifū as the eldest son of the Mogami family.
Sekigahara Campaign.
In 1600, when the Sekigahara campaign broke out between Ieyasu and his enemies led by Ishida Mitsunari, Ieyasu entrusted Yoshiaki with command of northern Oshu. On April 19, Ieyasu instructed the Nanbu, Onodera, and Akita clans to obey Yoshiaki's command, after Ieyasu turned his army back to face Mitsunari's forces on July 25, while he was at Oyama (Oyama City, Tochigi Prefecture). Yoshiaki was also informed by Ieyasu that the campaign against the Uesugi clan was cancelled. As a result, the troops that had gathered in Oshu returned to their home provinces. The Uesugi clan became emboldened and began to actively work against Ieyasu, contacting Yoshiaki and others to encourage them to join the Uesugi side.
Mogami faced a dilemma because he still supported Ieyasu, but if he did not join the Toyotomi side, there was a high possibility that he would be attacked by the Uesugi. As Yoshiaki believed in Ieyasu's victory in the Kamigata region, he tried to buy time, but in the end, the Uesugi forces invaded the Mogami territory on September 8. Yoshimichi Onodera, who was based at Yokote Castle (present-day Yokote City, Akita Prefecture), also responded to the Uesugi and invaded the Mogami territory. This resulted with now the Mogami clan withstand the invasion of battled Uesugi Kagekatsu.
The Uesugi forces which numbered more than 20,000, were invaded from the south by the main force commanded by Naoe Kanetsugu via the Kitsunegoe Highway, and from the west by the Shonai area. Because the difference in military strength between the Mogami forces and the Uesugi forces were huge, Yoshiaki requested reinforcements from Date Masamune. The message was relayed through Yoshiaki's eldest son, Yoshiyasu. Masamune decided to send reinforcements out of obligation for his mother, Yoshihime, who was a sister of Yoshiaki, and also loyalty to Ieyasu. In the same campaign, Yoshiaki aided in Date's siege of Shiroishi, and was then attacked in his own home castle of Hataya and Kaminoyama. He used geographical advantages to resist the invasions. Yoshiaki concentrated his forces in Hasedō Castle, Yamagata Castle, and Kaminoyama Castle. Naoe Kanetsugu's forces launched an all-out attack on Hasedō Castle, which was defended by 1,000 men. with the cooperation of the reinforcements sent by Yoshiaki from Yamagata Castle and the soldiers of Hasedō Castle, and their high fighting spirit, the defenders of Hasedō Castle fought well.
Based on the estimation by a team from Mogami Yoshimitsu History Museum research, on the battle ground sites along with the Uesugi clan's estimated route, and the estimation of both forces' composition, Hasedō Castle should have fallen easily. However, it was concluded that the guerrilla warfare conducted by Yoshiaki to harass the route of the Uesugi army played a role in the successful defense of the castle. The Uesugi forces were defeated in the attack on Kaminoyama Castle, and fled back to Yonezawa in disarray. It was said that at one occasion, a group of Mogami clan's ninja infiltrated the camp of Naoe Kanetsugu, stealing his battle standard, which later hoisted on the Hasedō Castle's gate, which greatly demoralized the Uesugi troops. In the 15 days of ineffective siege against the Hasedō Castle, the Uesugi troops cannot capture it from the persistent Mogami forces. In the final phase of this siege, the Uesugi forces launched another all-out attack on Hasedō Castle, but with the help of Date's reinforcements, they were able to hold out against the large Uesugi forces. In the end, when information came in that Tokugawa Ieyasu emerged victorious in the main Sekigahara battle, The uesugi forces under Kanetsugu began to withdraw from Hasedō Castle. Switching positions, Yoshiaki began to pursue them, but Kanetsugu himself concentrated his riflemen to defend his retreating army, and managed to withdraw safely back to Yonezawa.
In 1601, Yoshiaki also progressively recaptured the districts of Tagawa, Kushibiki, and Yusa from the Uesugi clan. After the campaign ended, the Mogami clan was rewarded with an increase in size from 200,000 to 570,000 "koku" for their domain in return for their loyalty to the Eastern army during the war. This made the Yamagata domain the fifth largest in Japan at the time, excluding the land held by Tokugawa. On May 11, Ieyasu, who had established his hegemony over the Toyotomi government, visited the Imperial Palace to receive an audience with the Emperor. He was accompanied by Mogami Yoshiaki as well as Mori Tadamasa, who had been instrumental in the attack on the Sanada clan, and Ii Naomasa, who had led the vanguard in the Battle of Sekigahara, and Oda Nagamasu.
Edo Period.
After the Tokugawa shogunate in Edo was established, Yoshiaki became the first ruler of the Yamagata Domain and implemented various policies. One of these was the establishment of a provincial law called the "Mogami Family Law".
During this era, Yoshiaki also attempted many construction projects such as restoring temples and shrines, including all the old temples in the Mogami clan domain that had existed since ancient times. The five-story pagoda at Mount Haguro, a national treasure, was also repaired by Yoshiaki. He also made great efforts in improving water transportation on the Mogami River. There were three difficult spots along the Mogami River, but he improved them to facilitate shipping between Kyoto and Yamagata . He also constructed a massive irrigation system (called "Kitadate Ozeki") in Shonai, with a total length of over 30 kilometers, and created 4,200 hectares of vast rice fields. He followed the advice of his vassal Kitadate Toshinaga, to override opposition from those around him and give permission for the construction projects, providing financial and material support to ensure their success.
It was noted that the Yamagata Castle is notable for not having a castle tower, despite being the second largest castle north of the Kanto region after Edo Castle. According to the record "Ugenki," despite the pressure from Mogami senior vassals who urged him to build a castle tower, Yoshiaki refused to allow it, as he did not want to overwork the citizens of his territory just to build castle towers.
However, after this, the relationship between Yoshiaki and his eldest son, Yoshiyasu, deteriorated due to a power struggle between their respective vassals. As the conflict continued, Yoshiaki worried that this could led to a civil war which would potentially cause the shogunate to strip the Mogami clan's control from their regions. Therefore, he decided to pass on the family headship to his second son, Iechika. It was believed the decision was also due to Tokugawa Ieyasu's fondness for Iechika, as Ieyasu had given Iechika a character from his own name, and he was well remembered by Ieyasu. During that time, Iechika was under the service of Ieyasu's son, Tokugawa Hidetada. Yoshiaki thought that if he allowed Iechika to succeed him as head of the family, he would be able to avoid the Mogami clan being punished by the shogun. In 1605, Yoshiaki ordered Yoshiyasu to enter Mount Koya and become a monk. Yoshiyasu followed his father's orders and set off for Mount Koya, but was murdered by one of Yoshiaki's retainers on the way. It is not known whether Yoshimitsu ordered Yoshiyasu's assassination. However, after the assassination, Yoshiaki made Jonenji Temple under Yamagata Castle into his family temple in order to pray for Yoshiyasu's soul.
Death.
Mogami Yoshiaki died from illness at Yamagata Castle in 1614 at the age of 68. Yamagata maintains the Mogami Yoshiaki Historical Museum, just outside the rebuilt Great Eastern Gate of Yamagata Castle, which displays his helmet, battle command baton and other implements he actually used.
It was reported that during his reign as Mogami clan's head not a single local uprising occurred within the territories of Mogami clan.
Legacy.
Mogami Yoshiaki laid out and built the castle town, which became the foundation of modern-day Yamagata City. He controlled the "Three Difficult Places" on the Mogami River, making navigation safer from the Sea of Japan inland, and bringing the culture of Kyōto and Ōsaka to Yamagata. His dam building projects at Kitadaseki, Inabazeki and other places, and other irrigation control measures helped develop rice cultivation in the Shōnai plain.
A museum named after Mogami Yoshiaki, who built the foundations of Yamagata city, was built by the officials of Yamagata City on December 1, 1989, to collect, preserve and study all the materials related to the Mogami clan who ruled the city from the Azuchi–Momoyama period until early Edo period.

Alexander Hamilton (sailor)

Alexander Hamilton (before 1688 – after 1733) was a Bombay Marine officer, sea captain, privateer and merchant.
Biography.
In his early years he travelled widely through Europe, the Barbary coast, the West Indies, India and Southeast Asia. On his arrival in Bombay in 1688 he was briefly pressed into the employ of the East India Company in a local war, and then set up as a private country trader, operating from Surat, India. 
He was appointed commander of the Bombay Marine in June 1717, in which post he suppressed piracy. In 1718, he visited the Ayutthaya Kingdom and his account of his visit there survives.
The main extant source of information on Hamilton is his own book, "A New Account of the East Indies" (1727). The term 'East Indies' then covered a much wider geographic area than it does today – 'most of the countries and islands of commerce and navigation, between the Cape of Good Hope and the island of Japan'. Illustrated with lively anecdotes, it provides a valuable insight into British involvement in and perception of early modern Asia. 
Confusingly, he used the English name "Canton" to refer to both the walled city (Guangzhou) and the province (Guangdong), but used "Canton" more often for the city and "Quantung" occasionally for the province.

Chennai Beach railway station

Chennai Beach (formerly known as Madras Beach) (station code: MSB) is a railway terminus of the Southern Railway network in Parry's Corner, Chennai, India. Built on reclaimed land, the station serves the suburban services of the Chennai Suburban Railway and Mass Rapid Transit System (Chennai) and a few passenger trains. It serves as the northern terminus for the Chennai MRTS line. The station is named after High Court Beach, which was later built up as part of Chennai Port, and not after the Marina Beach, which is located a few kilometres away and is served by , Triplicane and Lighthouse stations of the MRTS line. The station consists of 1500 square metres of open parking area.
The station is located adjacent to the High Court and Broadway. There is also Burma Bazaar, which sells foreign merchandise in small shops outside of the station. Most of the government offices and headquarters of some banks, and Parry Group's offices are also located near the station.
In addition to being a focal terminus for much of Chennai's rail network, the station is also a major bus transportation hub for passengers destined to north and northwest Chennai. Most of these local buses are situated near the station.
It acts as the access point for Chennai port for the port employees.
History.
With the development of the port, the surrounding areas were reclaimed and railway lines to connect the port were laid on the reclaimed land with a station built on it. Until the introduction of the electric trains, the city had the single steam rail line between Harbour and Tambaram, used by both passenger and goods trains. The plan to electrify railway lines in Madras was first initiated in 1923 by Sir Percy Rothera, an agent of the South Indian Railways, who felt the need for such a service. This was in a time when the city was expanding, with largely agricultural areas such as Saidapet, St. Thomas Mount and Tambaram developing into residential quarters. However, the plan was realised only in the following decade. Plan to build a new line between Beach and Egmore and two lines between Egmore and Tambaram was announced as part of the suburban remodelling initiative of South Indian Railways. On 27 December 1930, the first consignment of 25 electric carriages from England was received by the railway. The trains were painted in dull green with a black wheel base and featured wide sliding doors, a better-designed seating arrangement, and thick glass fronts. The new carriages were parked in Tambaram station.
The first electrically operated rail service in Madras began on 2 April 1931 between Madras Beach and , which became the earliest metre gauge to be electrified in the country. It was launched by Sir George Fredrick Stanley, the then governor of Madras, who was reported to have said at the opening ceremony that the new train services would transform "desolate south Madras into burgeoning garden cities". However, the service was opened to the public only a month later on 11 May 1931. The Madras Electricity Supply Corporation, which powered the railway lines, was aided by sub-stations in Egmore and Meenambakkam. Soon, the number of trains shuttling passengers was increased to 45 a day, running every 10 minutes at peak hours, and every 30 minutes, otherwise. The running time between Madras Beach and Tambaram stations, which was 2 hours until then, was reduced to 49 minutes. The train service was made available from 4:00 in the morning up to 12:00 at night.
The station was controlled by power-operated signalling from a cabin. When the double metre-gauge line from the station up to Tambaram was electrified in 1931 with the 1,500 V DC overhead system, automatic signalling was provided between the station and Madras Egmore. However, it does not signal the broad-gauge line of the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway from Rayapuram, which also serves the station. The single line to Rayapuram was controlled by the Theobald's Token instrument, invented by an engineer of the Madras Railway and manufactured locally in the city by a firm named Orr &amp; Co, which was used extensively on the lines of both the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway and the South Indian Railway. It was housed in the station office. The signalling of the station is controlled from Siemens all-electric power frame of 1935.
A subway connecting South Beach Road with North Beach Road near the station before Parry's Corner was built in 1967. In 1978, the Beach Station subway was built. The cabin was closed and demolished in August 2002 during remodelling of the station layout in view with the gauge conversion of the lines.
Location.
Built on a reclaimed land, the terminus lies on the far-eastern tip of the city, abutting the harbour coast. It is located in the historical neighbourhood of Georgetown and serves as the converging point of the northern and southern lines of the railways, making it the de facto focal point of the Chennai Suburban Railway Network. The terminus is located about from Chennai International Airport. The station premises is bordered by Rajaji Salai on the west and Chennai Port on the east. The main entrance is located on Rajaji Salai opposite General Post Office. The station is connected with Chennai Port by means of a footbridge.
Passenger Facilities.
There are two footbridges in the station, one each at the northern and the southern ends of the station, connecting platforms 4 through 8. The footbridge at the southern end extends into the Chennai Port, connecting the harbour with the railway station.
A project to extend one of the footbridges in the station over the Rajaji Salai on the western side was mooted in 2009–2010 at a cost of 5.2 million, and the foundation stone was laid in February 2011. The extension will be 33 metres long crossing the Rajaji Salai to reach the State Bank of India's new building complex.
A new reservation centre with ten reservation counters and a huge visitor's hall was built in 2013 from the general funds under the Railway Scheme. However, the centre has not yet been opened to public.
Projects and development.
It is one of the 73 stations in Tamil Nadu to be named for upgradation under "Amrit Bharat Station Scheme" of Indian Railways. In 2013, Chennai Corporation planned larger bus bays outside the station on Rajaji Salai after evicting about 41 shops along the pavement. The bus bays were being planned to hold at least three buses at a time, inside the existing bus stop. Ten years later, in 2023, a 4.3-km-long 4th line between Chennai Beach and Egmore (doubling work) has been started; it is slated to be completed in 7 months.
Services.
Chennai Beach station is one of the busiest railway stations in the city. Around 400 trips are operated from the station every day. This includes close to 250 services in the Beach–Tambaram–Chengalpattu sector and 134 services in the Beach—Velachery MRTS sector, in addition to services to Gummidipoondi and Ennore in the north and Avadi, Pattabiram, Tiruvallur, and Thiruttani in the west, and the less-frequent services to Chennai Central. The station sees close to 100,000 passengers every day using the city's suburban rail network, with more than 40,000 commuters buying tickets from the station every day. On an average, about 1,500 commuters book tickets every day at the passenger reservation counters at the station, with a revenue generation of around 250,000 per day.
Security.
In 2012, the station was brought under the 400-million Integrated Security Surveillance System (ISSS) project, when the first phase of the project was implemented in July 2012. The project, implemented jointly by the Southern Railways and HCL Infosystems, includes installation of CCTV cameras that would record visuals around the clock and store the data for 30 days. A total of 16 CCTV cameras have been installed at the station at a cost of 4.557 million, and footage will be transmitted and stored using an Internet Protocol system. The control room is located at the Railway Protection Force inspector's office on the first floor, with two 42-inch high-definition LCD TVs.

Cabri, Saskatchewan

Cabri is a town in southwestern Saskatchewan directly north of Gull Lake, northwest of Swift Current and east of the Great Sand Hills. It was incorporated as a village in 1912 and as a town in 1917.
The Cabri ferry started operation in 1912, crossing the South Saskatchewan River between the village of Cabri and the town that is now known as Kyle.
Name.
There are several interpretations surrounding the origin of the town's name, all of which revolve around the indigenous pronghorn antelope. Local folklore suggests that it was the early settlers' pronunciation of the First Nations word for "antelope". Another possibility is that it was derived from the Latin word "Antilocapridae", the genus to which the pronghorn belongs. Another suggestion is that voyageurs and Metis thought that pronghorns look like goats, and called them "cabri", a French equivalent word for goat.
Demographics.
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Cabri had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
Education.
Cabri School, part of the Chinook School Division, is a small school with about 100 students.
Transportation.
Cabri is along Highway 32, which runs from the city of Swift Current to the town of Leader. It is also along the Great Sandhill Railway line from Swift Current to Burstall. There is a small local airport, the Cabri Airport.
Cabri Area IBA.
The town of Cabri is at the centre of the Cabri Area (SK 045) Important Bird Area (IBA) of Canada. The IBA is roughly circular in shape and covers an area of and spans three RMs: Riverside No. 168, Miry Creek No. 229, and Pittville No. 169. The site is an important habitat for the burrowing owl, ferruginous hawk, Ross's goose, and the mallard duck.

Strained Relations

"Strained Relations" is an episode of the BBC sitcom "Only Fools and Horses". It was the second episode of series 4, and was first screened on 28 February 1985.
Synopsis.
It is a sad day for Del Boy and Rodney, as their Grandad has died. They have attended Grandad's funeral, along with Mike, Boycie, Trigger, and the North London branch of the Trotter family.
Back at the wake in Nelson Mandela House, Rodney is angry to find that Del is drinking and laughing with his friends instead of mourning. Del and Rodney also meet Grandad's younger brother, their Uncle Albert, who lives with Del and Rodney's cousins Stan and Jean in North London.
Later that night, Del and Rodney are alone in the flat, until a hungover Albert appears from the bathroom. He is informed by his nephews that Stan and Jean have gone home. Del agrees to let Albert stay for the night but does not allow him to sleep in Grandad's bedroom, since it is now a shrine to him (though this does not prevent him using it as a temporary storage area).
Del drives Albert home the next morning, only to return with him after discovering that Stan and Jean (who live in a caravan) have moved. Though Del initially decides to allow Albert to stay with them for a few days until he finds a place of his own, Albert mentions that this is not the first time he has been abandoned; the first relatives he stayed with emigrated while he was out shopping, and the second set fire to the house six months later. Worried that Albert may never leave, Del refuses to shelter Albert and orders him to go to the local Seaman's Mission. As Albert goes off to the kitchen to have a quick drink before leaving, Rodney scolds Del for his nasty attitude towards Albert and for his jolly behaviour during Grandad's wake. Del shouts back at Rodney, explaining that he does not know how to grieve, since always being forced to play the tough guy has led to him becoming a figure of great (but false) admiration, which he detests. Rodney finally understands and meekly apologises.
Later, at The Nag's Head, Albert shows up again, claiming that the Seaman's Mission has been torn down. Del finally relents and decides to let Albert stay with him and Rodney, and a new era for the Trotters begins. As they leave to get a curry, Mike gets hold of Albert and informs him that the Seaman's Mission just called saying they have a room available. Albert quickly tells Mike to be quiet.
Production.
This episode, along with "Happy Returns", was added in at the last minute, due to Lennard Pearce's illness and subsequent death. This left the producers with eight episodes instead of the standard six episodes in Series 4. "From Prussia with Love" was moved to Series 5 leaving seven episodes in Series 4.

Hydrogen-powered aircraft

A hydrogen-powered aircraft is an aeroplane that uses hydrogen fuel as a power source. Hydrogen can either be burned in a jet engine or another kind of internal combustion engine, or can be used to power a fuel cell to generate electricity to power an electric propulsor. It cannot be stored in a traditional wet wing, and hydrogen tanks have to be housed in the fuselage or be supported by the wing.
Hydrogen, which can be produced from low-carbon power and can produce zero emissions, can reduce the environmental impact of aviation. Airbus plans to launch a first commercial hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2040–2045, while Boeing is less optimistic. McKinsey &amp; Company forecast hydrogen aircraft entering the market in the late 2030s and scaling up through 2050, when they could account for a third of aviation's energy demand.
Hydrogen properties.
Hydrogen has a specific energy of 119.9 MJ/kg, compared to ~ MJ/kg for usual liquid fuels, times higher.
However, it has an energy density of 10.05 kJ/L at normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, compared to ~ kJ/L for liquid fuels, times lower.
When pressurised to , it reaches 4,500 kJ/L, still times lower than liquid fuels.
Cooled at , liquid hydrogen has an energy density of 8,491 kJ/L, times lower than liquid fuels.
Aircraft design.
The low volumetric energy density of hydrogen poses challenges when designing an aircraft, where weight and exposed surface area are critical. To reduce the size of the tanks, liquid hydrogen will be used, requiring cryogenic fuel tanks. Cylindrical tanks minimise surface for minimal thermal insulation weight, leading towards tanks in the fuselage rather than wet wings in conventional aircraft. Airplane volume and drag will be increased somewhat by larger fuel tanks. A larger fuselage adds more skin friction drag due to the extra wetted area. The extra tank weight is offset by dramatically lower liquid hydrogen fuel weight.
Gaseous hydrogen may be used for short-haul aircraft. Liquid hydrogen might be needed for long-haul aircraft.
Hydrogen's high specific energy means it would need less fuel weight for the same range, ignoring the repercussions of added volume and tank weight. As airliners have a fuel fraction of the Maximum Takeoff Weight MTOW between 26% for medium-haul to 45% for long-haul, maximum fuel weight could be reduced to % to % of the MTOW.
Fuel cells make sense for general aviation and regional aircraft but their engine efficiency is less than large gas turbines. They are more efficient than modern 7 to 90-passenger turboprop airliners such as the DASH 8.
The efficiency of a hydrogen-fueled aircraft is a trade-off of the larger wetted area, lower fuel weight, and added tank weight, varying with the aircraft size. Hydrogen is suited for short-range airliners. While longer-range aircraft need new aircraft designs.
Liquid hydrogen is one of the best coolants used in engineering, and precooled jet engines have been proposed to use this property for cooling the intake air of hypersonic aircraft, or even for cooling the aircraft's skin itself, particularly for scramjet-powered aircraft.
A study in the UK, NAPKIN (New Aviation, Propulsion Knowledge and Innovation Network), with collaboration from Heathrow Airport, Rolls-Royce, GKN Aerospace, and Cranfield Aerospace solutions, has investigated the potential of new hydrogen-powered aircraft designs to reduce the environmental impact of aviation. The aircraft designers have proposed a range of hydrogen-fuelled aircraft concepts, ranging from 7 to 90 seats, exploring the use of hydrogen with fuel cells and gas turbines to replace conventional aircraft engines powered by fossil fuels. The findings suggest that in the UK hydrogen-powered aircraft could be commercially viable for short-haul and regional flights by the second half of the 2020s with airlines potentially able to replace the entire UK regional fleet with hydrogen aircraft by 2040. However, the report highlighted that national supply, and the price of green liquid hydrogen relative to fossil kerosene are critical factors in determining uptake of hydrogen aircraft by airline operators. Modeling showed that, if hydrogen prices approach $1/kg, hydrogen aircraft uptake could cover almost 100% of the UK domestic market.
Emissions and environmental impact.
Hydrogen aircraft using a fuel cell design are zero emission in operation, whereas aircraft using hydrogen as a fuel for a jet engine or an internal combustion engine are zero emission for (a greenhouse gas which contributes to global climate change) but not for (a local air pollutant). The burning of hydrogen in air leads to the production of , i.e., the + ½ → reaction in a nitrogen-rich environment also causes the production of . However, hydrogen combustion produces up to 90% less nitrogen oxides than kerosene fuel, and it eliminates the formation of particulate matter.
If hydrogen is available in quantity from low-carbon power such as wind or nuclear, its use in aircraft will produce fewer greenhouse gases than current aircraft: water vapor and a small amount of nitrogen oxide. However, as of 2021, less than 5% of all hydrogen produced is emissions free, and the majority comes from fossil fuels.
A 2020 study by the EU Clean Sky 2 and Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertakings found that hydrogen could power aircraft by 2035 for short-range aircraft. A short-range aircraft (&lt; ) with hybrid Fuel cell/Turbines could reduce climate impact by 70–80% for a 20–30% additional cost, a medium-range airliner with H2 turbines could have a 50–60% reduced climate impact for a 30–40% overcost, and a long-range aircraft (&gt; ) also with H2 turbines could reduce climate impact by 40–50% for a 40–50% additional cost. Research and development would be required, in aircraft technology and into hydrogen infrastructure, regulations and certification standards.
Water vapor is a greenhouse gas – in fact, most of the total greenhouse effect on earth is due to water vapor. However, in the troposphere the content of water vapor is not dominated by anthropogenic emissions but rather the natural water cycle as water does not long remain static in that layer of the atmosphere. This is different in the stratosphere which – absent human action – would be almost totally dry and still remains relatively devoid of water. If hydrogen is burned and the resulting water vapor is released at stratospheric heights (the cruising altitude of some commercial flights is within the stratosphere – supersonic flight takes place almost entirely at stratospheric altitude), the content of water vapor in the stratosphere is increased. Due to the long residence time of water vapor at those heights, the long term effects over years or even decades cannot be entirely discounted.
History.
Demonstrations.
In February 1957, a Martin B-57B of the NACA flew on hydrogen for 20 min for one of its two Wright J65 engines rather than jet fuel. On 15 April 1988, the Tu-155 had a hydrogen fuel tank installed in the fuselage, and used a hydrogen fuelled engine in one nacelle, the other two engines were standard an adapted Tu-154 airliner.
Boeing converted a two-seat Diamond DA20 to run on a fuel cell designed and built by Intelligent Energy. It first flew on April 3, 2008. The Antares DLR-H2 is a hydrogen-powered aeroplane from Lange Aviation and the German aerospace center. In July 2010, Boeing unveiled its hydrogen powered Phantom Eye UAV, that uses two converted Ford Motor Company piston engines.
In 2010, the Rapid 200FC concluded six flight tests fueled by gaseous hydrogen.
The aircraft and the electric and energy system was developed within the European Union's project coordinated by the Politecnico di Torino.
Hydrogen gas is stored at 350 bar, feeding a fuel cell powering a electric motor along a lithium polymer battery pack.
On January 11, 2011, an AeroVironment Global Observer unmanned aircraft completed its first flight powered by a hydrogen-fueled propulsion system.
Developed by H2Fly, which is a spinoff of Germany's DLR Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics. The DLR HY4 four-seater was powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. Its first flight took place on September 29, 2016.
The German company H2FLY built the HY4. The aircraft completed the world's first piloted flight of an electric aircraft powered by liquid hydrogen. It carried out four test flights from Maribor, Slovenia, using only liquid hydrogen to power its fuel-cell propulsion system. According to H2FLY, the use of cryogenically stored liquid hydrogen instead of a gaseous alternative enabled a doubling of the aircraft's range, from 750 km (466 miles) to approximately 1,500 km (932 miles), due to significantly lower tank weight and volume.
The HY4 can seat four passengers and features a twin-fuselage design. It has a maximum speed of 125 mph and a cruising speed of 90 mph.
It has the possibility to store of hydrogen, 4x11 kW fuel cells and 2x10 kWh batteries.
On 19 January 2023, ZeroAvia flew its Dornier 228 testbed with one turboprop replaced by a prototype hydrogen-electric powertrain in the cabin, consisting of two fuel cells and a lithium-ion battery for peak power. The aim is to have a certifiable system by 2025 to power airframes carrying up to 19 passengers over .
On 2 March 2023, Universal Hydrogen flew a Dash 8 40-passenger testbed with one engine powered by their hydrogen-electric powertrain. The company has received an order from Connect Airlines to convert 75 ATR 72-600 with their hydrogen powertrains.
On 8 November 2023, Airbus flew a modified Schempp-Hirth Arcus-M glider, dubbed the Blue Condor, equipped with a hydrogen combustion engine for the first time, using hydrogen as its sole source of fuel.
On 24 June 2024, Joby Aviation's S4 eVTOL demonstrator, refitted with a hydrogen-electric powertrain in May, completed a record 523 miles non-stop flight, more than triple the range of the battery powered version. It landed with 10% liquid hydrogen fuel remaining in its cyrogenic fuel tank, and the only in-flight emission was water vapor. A hydrogen fuel cell system provided the power for the six electric rotors of the eVTOL during its flight, and a small battery provided added takeoff and landing power.
The American aerospace company acquired German hydrogen flight developer H2FLY, known for its advancements in hydrogen-electric propulsion. Based on this technology, Joby integrated similar liquid hydrogen (LH2) systems into a hydrogen-electric vertical take-off and landing eVTOL demonstrator, which is SHy4. On 11 July, Joby Aviation announced that its demonstrator aircraft had completed a 523-mile flight in June, more than five times the range achievable using the company's standard battery electric powertrain. The pre-production prototype had a liquid hydrogen fuel tank and a hydrogen fuel cell system. According to its manufacturers, the aircraft, which had previously flown more than 25,000 miles using battery electric power, landed with 10 per cent of its hydrogen fuel load remaining. Joby's engineering team collaborated with hydrogen propulsion specialists H2Fly, based in Stuttgart.
Aircraft projects.
In 1975, Lockheed prepared a study of liquid hydrogen fueled subsonic transport aircraft for NASA Langley, exploring airliners carrying 130 passengers over 2,780 km (1500 nmi); 200 passengers over 5,560 km (3,000 nmi); and 400 passengers over 9,265 km (5,000 nmi).
Between April 2000 and May 2002, the European Commission funded half of the Airbus-led "Cryoplane" Study, assessing the configurations, systems, engines, infrastructure, safety, environmental compatibility and transition scenarios.
Multiple configurations were envisioned: a 12-passenger business jet with a range, regional airliner for 44 passengers over and 70 passengers over , a medium range narrowbody aircraft for 185 passengers over and long range widebody aircraft for 380 to 550 passengers over .
In September 2020, Airbus presented three "ZEROe" hydrogen-fuelled concepts aiming for commercial service by 2035: a 100-passenger turboprop, a 200-passenger turbofan, and a futuristic design based around a blended wing body. 
The aircraft are powered by gas turbines rather than fuel cells.
In December 2021, the UK Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) presented its "FlyZero" study of cryogenic liquid hydrogen used in gas turbines for a 279-passenger design with of range. ATI is supported by Airbus, Rolls-Royce, GKN, Spirit, General Electric, Reaction Engines, Easyjet, NATS, Belcan, Eaton, Mott MacDonald and the MTC.
In August 2021 the UK Government claimed it was the first to have a Hydrogen Strategy. This report included a suggested strategy for hydrogen powered aircraft along with other transport modes.
In March 2022, FlyZero detailed its three concept aircraft:
Propulsion projects.
In March 2021, Cranfield Aerospace Solutions announced the Project Fresson switched from batteries to hydrogen for the nine-passenger Britten-Norman Islander retrofit for a September 2022 demonstration. Project Fresson is supported by the Aerospace Technology Institute in partnership with the UK Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy and Innovate UK.
Pratt &amp; Whitney wants to associate its geared turbofan architecture with its Hydrogen Steam Injected, Inter‐Cooled Turbine Engine (HySIITE) project, to avoid carbon dioxide emissions, reduce NOx emissions by 80%, and reduce fuel consumption by 35% compared with the current jet-fuel PW1100G, for a service entry by 2035 with a compatible airframe.
On 21 February 2022, the US Department of Energy through the OPEN21 scheme run by its Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) awarded P&amp;W $3.8 million for a two-year early stage research initiative, to develop the combustor and the heat exchanger used to recover water vapour in the exhaust stream, injected into the combustor to increase its power, and into the compressor as an intercooler, and into the turbine as a coolant.
In February 2022, Airbus announced a demonstration of a liquid hydrogen-fueled turbofan, with CFM International modifying the combustor, fuel system and control system of a GE Passport, mounted on a fuselage pylon on an A380 prototype, for a first flight expected within five years.
In April 2025, startup Green Aero Propulsion demonstrated its Blue Dragon turbojet, the first hydrogen based aero engine in India. Key components were additively manufactured, like single piece metal 3D printed liners and critical components. Green Aero previously researched hydrogen injectors and combustion chambers with dedicated test rigs featuring optical access into the combustion chamber enabling a real-time analysis of flame stabilization and flame flash back phenomenon.
Decline.
By 2025, multiple projects were scaled down or terminated as major changes are needeed in infrastructure, while hydrogen is also used for power to liquid synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
Lacking new funding, Universal Hydrogen closed down in June 2024 while Airbus pushed back its hydrogen-powered projects by five to 10 years, and Embraer followed.

Jean Passepartout

Jean Passepartout () is a fictional character in Jules Verne's novel "Around the World in Eighty Days", published in 1873. He is the French valet of the novel's English main character, Phileas Fogg. His surname translates literally to "goes everywhere", but “passepartout” is also an idiom meaning "skeleton key" in French. It can also be understood as a play on the English word "passport"—or its French equivalent .
Fictional biography.
At the beginning of the novel, Passepartout has just been hired by Phileas Fogg after Fogg's previous valet failed to meet his exacting standards on 2 October 1872 at twenty eight minutes past eight. Passepartout, who has lived an irregular and well-travelled life, is looking forward to a restful employment, as Fogg is known for his regular habits which never take him farther afield than the Reform Club.
On Passepartout's first day at work, Fogg makes a bet with his friends at the Club that he can circumnavigate the world within 80 days and Passepartout is obliged to accompany him. In addition to the wager, the valet has an additional incentive to complete the journey quickly: he left a gaslight burning in his room and the resulting expense of wasted gas will be docked from his salary.
During the journey, Passepartout plays a needed role in Fogg's adventures, such as rescuing a young woman named Aouda from a forced sati and becoming a friend of Fix, a police detective who suspects Fogg of robbing a bank. Passepartout learns of Fix's suspicions, but keeps them to himself as he believes Fogg already has enough to worry about concerning his wager, and comes to suspect Fogg may possibly have committed the crime considering the extraordinary spending his master does through the trip's more desperate moments. Due to his silence, however, Fogg and Fix never have a chance to discuss the case in neutral territory, and Fix arrests Fogg as soon as they return to England. This critically delays Fogg before he is exonerated and the company arrives in London, seemingly too late and leaving Passepartout in almost suicidal despair at his foolishness.
The next day home, Aouda proposes to Fogg to help him in his hard life ahead. While searching for a minister to marry the couple, Passepartout discovers that the date is one day earlier than he thought, due to the party having traveled east across the International Date Line. Once Fogg learns of the error, he dashes to the Reform Club and arrives just in time to win the bet.
Fogg marries Aouda, with Passepartout giving away the bride, and divides the net proceeds from the journey between Passepartout and Fix - but not without deducting the cost of the gaslight use from Passepartout's share.
The character Passepartout serves several purposes in the narrative - as a point-of-view character for Verne's French readers and as comic relief, both in his reactions to the strange places and events he encounters, and in a tendency to get trapped, abducted, or, on at least one occasion, left behind.

Joe Gilmore

Joseph "Joe" Gilmore (19 May 1922 – 18 December 2015) was a renowned bartender and famous mixologist during the 20th century. He was Head Barman at The Savoy Hotel's American Bar from 1954 to 1976 and is recognised as the creator of numerous cocktails to mark special events and important guests, a longstanding tradition at the American Bar. Gilmore's most famous creations include Moonwalk, Link-Up, The Corpse Reviver, Lorraine, and Missouri Mule.
Early life.
Joseph Patrick Gilmore was born on 19 May 1922 in Belfast, Northern Ireland to John Gilmore, a tobacconist, and Margaret O'Connor, a tailoress, from Belfast, Ireland.
He was the third of nine children.
In 1938, aged 16, Gilmore moved to London looking for work and "adventure". He began working as a wallpaper packer at the Arthur Sanderson &amp; Son's factory in Perivale, London, later taking up work as a kitchen hand.
Gilmore began his early bartender training at La Coquille, a French restaurant on St Martin's Lane, Covent Garden, among other places. While working at The Olde Bell he met and served Welsh millionaire steel-baron Kenneth Davies and the aviator Amy Johnston. The couple reportedly asked Gilmore for a dry martini, which he attempted unsuccessfully. Despite his attempt being enjoyed by the couple, Davies and Johnston politely demonstrated how to make one. Gilmore cited this interaction as the spark that fuelled his passion of cocktail mixology. After this first encounter, Davies and Gilmore became life long friends.
Career.
Gilmore first began working at The Savoy as a commis waiter at The American Bar of the Savoy Hotel. By 1940, aged 18, he was promoted to trainee barman and began his apprenticeship with Harry Craddock, earning £3.10s a week.
In 1954, Gilmore took over as head bartender. Over the following two decades Gilmore created new cocktails, especially to honour special occasions and important guests, including Princess Diana, Prince William, Anne, The Princess Royal, The Queen Mother, Sir Winston Churchill, and American Presidents Harry S. Truman and Richard Nixon.
In addition to serving five generations of royals at private receptions and parties, Gilmore frequently served Errol Flynn, Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chaplin, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Grace Kelly, George Bernard Shaw, Ernest Hemingway, Noël Coward, Agatha Christie, Alice Faye, Ingrid Bergman, Julie Andrews, Laurence Olivier, Joan Crawford, Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli, Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra and Winston Churchill.
In 1969, he created one of his most famous cocktails, the "Moonwalk", to commemorate the Apollo 11 Moon landing. The cocktail is a combination of grapefruit juice, orange liqueur and rose water, topped with champagne. This was the first drink astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had upon returning to Earth.
Frank Sinatra was a frequent guest to the American Bar whenever he was in London and insisted only Gilmore was to serve him. It is widely believed the line from Sinatra’s One For My Baby "set’em up Joe" is in reference to Gilmore.
Gilmore retired from the Savoy in 1976.
Cocktails created.
The Blenheim.
Created for Sir Winston Churchill’s ninetieth birthday. It is also known as the Four Score and Ten.
Churchill.
Created for Sir Winston Churchill on one of his many visits to The Savoy.
Common market.
Created to mark Britain’s entry into the European Economic Community in 1973, using drinks from all the member states. 
Four score (1955).
Created for Sir Winston Churchill’s eightieth birthday. 
Golden doublet.
Created in 1973 to commemorate the wedding of Princess Anne to Captain Mark Phillips. Doublet was the name of the Princess’s horse on which she participated in the European Championships in 1973. 
Kensington Court special.
Created for Sir David Davies.
Link up.
Created in 1975 to mark the American and Russians link up in Space, the Apollo–Soyuz project. The link up cocktail was sent to the U.S. and U.S.S.R. for the astronauts to enjoy when they returned from their mission. When told this by NASA as they linked up in Space, they responded, "Tell Joe we want it up here." 
Lorraine.
Created to mark President Charles de Gaulle’s State visit to Britain after the Second World War. 
Missouri mule.
The Missouri mule cocktail was created for President Harry S Truman. The cocktail commemorates Truman's home state of Missouri and the donkey mascot of the Democratic Party (a mule is a hybrid of a donkey and a horse).
Moonwalk.
Created in 1969 to mark the first human Moon landing. The cocktail was the first drink the American astronauts had when they returned to Earth. A letter of thanks was later sent from Neil Armstrong to Joe Gilmore. 
My Fair Lady.
Created to mark Julie Andrews’ first night in the musical "My Fair Lady". 
Nixon.
Created in 1969 to mark American President Richard Nixon's visit to Britain. The cocktail was mixed at the American bar and then sent over to Claridge's where Nixon was staying.
Powerscourt.
Created for Sarah, Duchess of York’s
The Ed Shelly.
Created for Edward Shelly at his request. 
Royal arrival.
Created in 1960 to mark the birth of Prince Andrew.

Savoy royale.
Created for The Queen Mother on one of her private visits to The Savoy.
Savoy corpse reviver.
The Corpse Revivers are a series of hangover cures invented during prohibition. This recipe is a variation invented by Gilmore in 1954.
Wolfram.
Created in 1990 to commemorate the election of John Wolff Director of Rudolf Wolff as Chairman of the London Metal Exchange. "Wolfram" is another name for the element tungsten.
Personal life.
Gilmore married Marie Jeanne Zambelli in 1943. They had three sons.
During The Blitz, Gilmore helped protect The Savoy by working as a fire warden from its roof.
Gilmore never returned to Ireland, but "...never forgot his Irish roots or family background and never lost his soft Belfast accent." He remained a Roman Catholic throughout his life, and died on 18 December 2015, aged 93.

Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone

The "Tropidostoma" Assemblage Zone is a tetrapod assemblage zone or biozone which correlates to the lower Teekloof Formation, Adelaide Subgroup of the Beaufort Group, a fossiliferous and geologically important geological Group of the Karoo Supergroup in South Africa. The thickest outcrops, reaching approximately , occur from east of Sutherland through to Beaufort West and Victoria West, to areas south of Graaff-Reinet. Its northernmost exposures occur west/north-west of Colesberg. The "Tropidostoma" Assemblage Zone is the fourth biozone of the Beaufort Group.
The name of the biozone refers to "Tropidostoma microtrema", a herbivorous dicynodont therapsid. This biozone is characterized by the presence of this species in association with another dicynodont species, "Endothiodon uniseries".
History.
The first fossils to be found in the Beaufort Group rocks that encompass the current eight biozones were discovered by Andrew Geddes Bain in 1856. However, it was not until 1892 that it was observed that the geological strata of the Beaufort Group could be differentiated based on their fossil taxa. The initial undertaking was done by Harry Govier Seeley who subdivided the Beaufort Group into three biozones, which he named (from oldest to youngest):
These proposed biozones Seeley named were subdivided further by Robert Broom between 1906 and 1909. Broom proposed the following biozones (from oldest to youngest):
The current stratigraphic range of the "Tropidostoma" Assemblage Zone was previously included within the "Endothiodon" beds ascribed by Broom. Decades later between the 1970s and early 1990s, Keyser and Smith collaborated on several field trips into known outcrop areas in order to re-evaluate the fossil biostratigraphy. After relevant fossil taxa data had been collected, the biozone was renamed the "Tropidostoma" Assemblage Zone due to the discovery that "Tropidostoma" fossils were only found within the confines of a certain area.
Lithology.
The "Tropidostoma" Assemblage Zone correlates with the lower Teekloof Formation, Adelaide Subgroup of the Beaufort Group. This biozone is considered to be early Late Permian in age. The rock composition of this biozone is dominated by mudstones and siltstones, ranging from greenish-grey, grey, and dark reddish brown in colour. The mudstones and siltstones, measuring approximately 3 m thick in most outcrops and exposures, frequently contain calcareous or micritic nodule horizons and rhizocretions. Sheet-type single-storied channel sandstones are also found, the lower portion of the biozone often containing fining upward sequences. Calcium carbonate precipitation crusts and gypsum “desert rose” crystals have been uncovered in the sandstone layers.
The preserved rocks show that the depositional environment of this biozone was formed in a lacustrine and overbank environment, which flowed northwards in long, meandering rivers. This low energy environment is conducive for preferential deposition of finer sediment types which formed the mudstone and siltstone deposits. However, the climate was seasonally dry due to the presence of calcium carbonate precipitation in the sandstones. Coarser clastic material was only deposited during seasonal floods. The meandering rivers flowed from a foreland basin that was being formed from the rising of the Gondwanide mountains in the south. The Gondwanides were the result of crustal uplift that had previously begun to take course due to tectonic activity. The pressure of the growing Gondwanides mountain chain caused the formation of the Karoo Basin where the deposits of the "Tropidostoma" Assemblage zone, and all other succeeding assemblage zone deposits, were deposited over tens of millions of years.
Paleontology.
Vertebrate fossils of the "Tropidostoma" Assemblage Zone are predominantly found in the thick mudstone and siltstone sequences. Fossils are often encrusted within the calcareous or micritic nodules. The biozone is characterized by the presence of "Tropidostoma" in association with "Endothiodon". However, the occurrence of these taxa are fairly rare in this biozone and their presence is characterized together with the more numerous fossils of the dicynodont species "Pristerodon" and "Diictodon". "Diictodon" fossils are particularly ubiquitous in this biozone with isolated skull and post-cranial material being most commonly found. In the lower deposits, complete fossil skeletons of "Diictodon" are more commonly found, often in pairs and curled up together. These intriguing paired "Diictodon" fossils are invariably recovered from the bottom of helical burrow casts, which have been attributed to "Diictodon". The helical burrows - a generally accepted feature of the "Tropidostoma" Assemblage Zone - are vertical, spiralling tubes measuring just under 1 m in length. The burrows are found infilled with either fine sandstone or siltstone with calcareous concretions. The burrows were likely infilled during single flood events, suddenly trapping and burying the "Diictodon" pairs inside alive. This provides an explanation for the near perfect preservation of the "Diictodon" pairs found in the burrow casts.
Other notable fossil material from the "Tropidostoma" Assemblage Zone includes the first appearance of larger gorgonopsid species such as "Lycaenops ornatus", "Cyonosaurus longiceps", and "Gorgonops torvus". It is noted that gorgonopsians take over from the basal therocephalians as the top predators from this biozone through to the end of the Permian period. However, smaller therocephalian species such as "Ictidosuchoides longiceps" remained present. The cynodont species "Procynosuchus delaharpeae" has been recovered from the upper sections of this biozone. Dicynodont species diversified greatly in this biozone, a speciation trend that continued with this group until the end of the Permian period. A pareiasaur species, "Pareiasaurus serridens", various subspecies of the temnospondyl amphibian "Rhinesuchus", the fishes "Namaichthys" and "Atherstonia", and fossil plant material of "Glossopteris" and "Dadoxylon" have been found. Finally, vertebrate burrows left by "Diictodon" as previously discussed, vertebrate trackways left by various therapsid species, and coprolites have been recovered.

Nothing Broken but My Heart

"Nothing Broken but My Heart" is a song by Canadian singer Celine Dion, recorded for her second English-language album, "Celine Dion" (1992). It was released as the third single in Canada, the United States and Japan in August 1992, and fourth in Australia in January 1993. Written by Diane Warren and produced by Walter Afanasieff, it topped the adult contemporary charts in both the United States and Canada. The song was Dion's second single to reach the number-one position on the US "Billboard" Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. It peaked at number three in Canada and number 29 in the United States. In 1994, "Nothing Broken but My Heart" won an ASCAP Pop Award for most performed song in the United States.
Critical reception.
Larry Flick from "Billboard" magazine described the song as a "melodramatic power ballad", noting that its "booming production values and a tearful vocal will push all the right buttons". Randy Clark from "Cashbox" felt it is "full of Celine's brilliant power, and sounds like it might be another AC success." Rufer and Fell from the "Gavin Report" commented, "A Diane Warren song sung by Ms. Dion's velvet hammer voice. An unbeatable combination does it again". In a retrospective review, Christopher Smith of Talk About Pop Music stated that it "throws everything possible in, some electric guitars, Celine's soaring vocals and a beautiful, long fade out".
Music video.
The accompanying music video for "Nothing Broken but My Heart" was made for the edited version, because the original track lasts almost six minutes. It was released in August 1992 and features actors practicing the "Romeo and Juliet" play. It was directed by Lyne Charlebois and filmed in Montreal. The video was later published on Dion’s official channel in August 2012 and has amassed over 5.7 million views.
Live performances.
Dion performed the song for the first time on 14 July 1992 during her appearance on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno". Later, she performed this song at the MuchMusic Canadian Video Awards in September 1992. She also performed it during her Celine Dion in Concert tour in 1992 and 1993.

Collaborationist Chinese Army

The term Collaborationist Chinese Army refers to the military forces of the puppet governments founded by Imperial Japan in mainland China during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. They include the armies of the Provisional (1937–1940), Reformed (1938–1940) and Reorganized National Governments of the Republic of China (1940–1945), which absorbed the former two regimes.
Those forces were commonly known as puppet troops but went under different names during their history depending on the specific unit and allegiance, such as Nanjing Army. In total, it was estimated that all pro-Japanese collaborationist Chinese forces combined had a strength of around 683,000.
Provisional Government.
Originally, the Japanese did not allow Wang Kemin's Provisional Government of the Republic of China to have an army of its own and instead relied on a police force of 5,000 men for security. In May 1938 steps were taken towards forming an actual army for his government by opening a military academy in Beijing, with an initial intake of a hundred cadets for a one-year course. In February 1939, a Training School was opened for non-commissioned officers with one thousand cadets undergoing a six-month course. The target strength the Provisional Government wanted to reach was 13,200 men divided into 8 infantry regiments, with six of them being formed into brigades, commanded by a Chinese major general and a Japanese advisor. Along with graduates of the academies, who were given the rank of lieutenant or second lieutenant, there were also former Nationalist and warlord officers. In addition, there was also a 400-man bodyguard unit for Wang.
The Provisional Government Army's order of battle was as follows:
Reformed Government.
The poorly-organized Reformed Government of the Republic of China, which managed the occupied zones in central China, raised a minimal armed force of generally poor quality. In December 1938, Pacification Minister Ren Yuandao announced that the army consisted of 10,000 troops. A military academy was established with 320 cadets between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five, with the intent of creating a new officer class "untainted" by prior service in the Nationalist Army and loyal to the Reformed Government. The year-long training course was given by Japanese officers. However, their training was cut short as the expanded army, which numbered 30,000 men by November 1939, needed officers. Its quality was low, as reports indicated that Reformed Government troops fled from guerillas that they engaged.
The Reformed Government Army was initially organized as follows:
In addition, a 'water patrol corps' was created in June 1939 to police the coastline and inland waterways. It was commanded by Vice Admiral Xu Jianding, the former commander of the Nationalist navy's Yangtze Squadron. A water police training school was established with 150 cadets trained by 30 Japanese and 30 Chinese instructors. However, it had few vessels to carry out its duty with. There were also plans to form an air force and several training gliders were purchased from Japan, but these plans never came to fruition by the time the Reformed Government was merged with the newly-formed Reorganized National Government of China as the Nanjing Army in 1940.
Nanjing Government.
Army.
During its existence, the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China fielded a force that was estimated by Western sources to have been between 300,000 and 500,000 strong. Wang Jingwei initially planned to raise a force of twelve divisions under his personal command, although most Nanjing Government troops were only under his nominal control throughout the war. All military matters were theoretically managed by the Central Military Commission, but in reality the body was largely symbolic and had little authority. The Nanjing Army commanders were able to operate without much interference from Wang's government and in many cases were former warlords or officers of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Army. Wang initially recruited his troops from former Nationalist soldiers and the collaborationist troops that had previously served the Provisional and Reformed Governments, which were both united under Wang's command. In the "Japan–China Military Affairs Agreement" signed by Japan and the Reorganized National Government, the Japanese agreed to train and equip an unspecified number of divisions for the Nanjing Army. They were provided with mostly captured Nationalist equipment along with small amounts of Japanese weapons.
Their Japanese advisors viewed the army as a strictly infantry force, providing it only with minimal artillery and armor, and what little they did receive was mostly used by Wang's three Capital Guard divisions. The main type of artillery in use by the Nanjing Army were medium mortars, with 31 field guns (including Model 1917 mountain guns) being in use by the Guards divisions. The Japanese provided 18 Type 94 tankettes in 1941 so that the Wang Jingwei regime would have at least a token armored force. Records indicate that the Nanjing Army was also given 20 armored cars and 24 motorcycles. Since there were few factories in the Nanjing Government's territory, it had to rely on weapons captured from Nationalist troops and those provided by Japan. Due to this the quality and quantity of small arms used by the Nanjing Army varied greatly. Two of the most widely used rifles were the Chinese version of the Karabiner 98k and the Hanyang 88, though various other kinds also found their way to the army. In 1941 the Japanese sold some 15,000 captured Carcano rifles and 30,000 new Arisaka rifles which were issued to the best Nanjing Army units. Various machine gun models were also used, including the Czech ZB-26 light machine gun and Type 3 heavy machine gun. Even when Nanjing troops were decently armed, the amount of ammunition they received was limited, but later in the war the Nanjing regime was producing some equipment in its own factories.
Among those targeted for recruitment by the Nanjing Nationalist Government and Japanese were former warlord officers of the 1911–1928 period. Due to the personal loyalty of Chinese troops to their commanders, several Nationalist Chinese generals that defected brought their armies over with them. Many Nationalist units defected on orders of Chiang Kai-shek in order to preserve them for the later war against the Chinese Communists that he knew he would fight after Japan's defeat. As a result, the Nanjing Army was never fully trusted due to its suspect loyalties and therefore received limited heavy weapons, but the worsening war situation for Japan meant that they had to rely on it more often and thus Nanjing units were granted better equipment. These troops were mostly used for defending important locations and for combating Communist partisans. In addition, many local irregular units were raised as well, including militias, volunteer and rural guards, which were mainly formed in order to counter guerrilla fighters. However, their quality was very low due to their limited training and lack of arms, and they were regarded as unreliable.
The units that were considered to be the most reliable and loyal by Wang Jingwei included the three Guards divisions in Nanjing (about 10,000 men per division), the 1st Front Army (about 20,000 men), based throughout the Lower Yangtze, and the Taxation Police Corps (about 3,000 men), which had been raised personally by Zhou Fohai and were loyal to him. The Capital Guards Divisions were formed from an independent brigade created in May 1941 in Nanjing, which was considered a success and raised to the size of a division. Shortly afterwards another two divisions were created. These Guards units were given the best equipment, weapons, and uniforms, with a personal loyalty to Wang himself. The Taxation Police Corps was created in Shanghai by Finance Minister Zhou Fohai for his own protection and owed its loyalty to him, and he sought to raise its quality to that of a regular IJA division. It increased in size from 3,000 to around 20,000 men. They, like Wang's Capital Guard divisions, received some of the best supplies and were highly regarded as among the Nanjing regime's best units. They were later moved out of Shanghai and were used for fighting guerillas. Morale and reliability of the average Nanjing Army units was a matter of their location. Intelligence reports from 1944 indicate that those units who were stationed near Nanjing and took orders from Wang Jingwei's government were more effective and motivated than those who were further away and commanded by others.
Organization.
The standard divisional organization of the Nanjing Army was as follows:
However, this structure was rarely followed and there was a disparity in the sizes of different units. For example, some units referred to as "armies" had a strength of a few thousand men while others that were called "divisions" had more than 6,000. Only the elite Guards divisions in Nanjing actually followed the standard structure. In order to improve organization, a central wireless station was built in Nanjing and smaller relay posts throughout occupied China were also established to improve communications between the general staff and outlying units. By January 1943 it was reported that the units in and around Nanjing were organized into a "Metropolitan Defense Army" of some 30,000 men, consisting of the three Guards divisions. Reports from October 1943 claimed that the strength of the Nanjing Army in south and central China was 42 divisions, 5 independent brigades, and 15 independent regiments. Information regarding the Nanjing Army is incomplete and creating a full picture of the Wang Jingwei regime's order of battle is impossible. There were different estimates for their total troop numbers, ranging from 300,000 to as much as 683,000.
In effect, most military forces in north China that were part of the Nanjing Army were really under the authority of the semi-autonomous North China Political Council, led by former Provisional Government leader Wang Kemin. In 1940, it was reported that the total strength of the units in North China was 22 regiments, along with 8 independent and training regiments. As a result of a recruitment drive in November 1940, the North China Political Council's army increased from 26,000 to 41,000 men. The number of collaborationist police in the region was about 135,000 and local militia numbered about 200,000. Following a reform in 1942, the army increased to 30 regiments. The regimental structure of the North China Council forces was as follows:
The first Nanjing Army military academy was actually established before the government, in 1939 near Shanghai, to train the forces of earlier puppet governments. The academy was first commanded by Ye Peng, a former Nationalist officer, and included 800 cadets divided into two battalions. The academy was issued with some of the best equipment by the Japanese and was intended to allow for the rapid expansion of the Nanjing Army. In September 1941 a Central Military Academy was established in Nanjing with and initial enrollment of one thousand cadets between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five. The training course was provided for two years before they were intended to join the army as junior officers, and Wang hired reserve Japanese officers to serve as instructors. US intelligence reports indicate that later on they formed a branch of the Central Military Academy in Canton, and another military academy in Beijing, the latter of which probably was used to prepare officers for the units under the North China Political Council's authority.
Operations.
The majority of the work undertaken by the Nanjing Army was guard and police duty in the occupied territories, in order to free up Imperial Japanese Army troops to fight on more important fronts. One of their main tasks was to combat Communist guerrillas fighting in occupied zones. The other main task was to provide support for Japanese army units during their campaigns. Information on the exact details of their operations remain vague and hard to find, however it was known that they took part in several major actions during the war against both Communist partisans and the Nationalist Army. Their first major pacification operation occurred to the east and northeast of Suzhou in May 1941. They fought in support of Japanese forces against the Communist New Fourth Army and gave the insurgents heavy casualties before they retreated out of the area. By fall, it was considered a success. From 1941 to 1944 the troops of Wang's military fought with Japanese forces in a campaign to eliminate Nationalist insurgents in the area between Hangzhou and the Yangtze River. Late in the war, with the defeat of Japan inevitable, several army units redeployed themselves in the Lower Yangtze region on orders of President Chen Gongbo.
After the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the Nanjing Government fell quickly and few military units remained loyal to it. Among those were Central Military Academy cadets, who built fortifications in Nanjing before fights broke out between the pro-Chen Gongbo and pro-Chiang Kai-shek factions. Most Nanjing units, however, surrendered peacefully and joined the Nationalists. Reportedly, the Guards Divisions and some of the cadets from the Shanghai Naval Academy later distinguished themselves fighting for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War.
Navy.
The Navy of the Reorganized National Government was first created on 13 December 1940 by the Japanese, with an inauguration ceremony taking place in Weihaiwei. It was attended by officials, including vice chief of naval staff, Zhang Xiyuan, along with the commander of the Japanese naval forces operating in north China. Several former Nationalist navy vessels were handed over by Japan, along with several naval bases, including Weihaiwei and Qingdao. There are reports that the former Nationalist cruisers "Ning Hai" and "Ping Hai" were given to the Nanjing Navy by Japan and were commissioned in a large ceremony, becoming useful propaganda tools. They were used until 1943 when the Imperial Japanese Navy took them for its own use. By 1944, the Nanjing Navy was under the direct command of Naval Minister Ren Yuandao and mostly functioned as a coastal patrol force.
At that time, it was reported that the total strength of the Nanjing Navy was 19 warships, 12 gunboats, 24 special gunboats, and 6 survey craft. There were also 37 small vessels that were under construction since 1942. The navy also included two regiments of marines, one based at Canton and the other at Weihaiwei. A Naval Academy was also set up in Shanghai. The navy uniform was that of the IJN. Ratings wore white jumpers, trousers and cap with the jumper having a large blue collar with a white border, and the name of the sailor's ship in Chinese. Officers wore white jackets and trousers with a white peaked cap. High-ranking officers wore black tunics. That was worn with black trousers and black peaked cap with gold trimming and a woven cap badge. The badge was a wreath with a gold anchor along with a blue sky and sun badge above that.
Air force.
The air force of the Nanjing Government was first formed in May 1941 with the founding of an Aviation School that took in a hundred cadets, and its first aircraft–three Tachikawa Ki-9 trainers–were received around that time. The Japanese eventually provided more Ki-9s and Tachikawa Ki-55 advanced trainers in 1942, in addition to some transports, including a Fokker Super Universal as Wang Jingwei's personal transport, and several Mitsubishi Ki-57 medium and Tachikawa Ki-54c light transports. Along with them there were also an L2D3 transport and Nakajima Ki-34 eight-passenger planes. Wang Jingwei planned to expand the air force and to form a fighter squadron with some Nakajima Ki-27 fighters. However, the Japanese did not trust the Nanjing Air Force enough to give them any combat aircraft, worrying that the pilots might defect to the Nationalists along with them. Morale was reportedly low and a number of Nanjing Air Force pilots made contacts with the Nationalist intelligence service. Some defections by pilots also took place, though the exact number is unknown.
The only offensive craft that the Nanjing Air Force possessed were two Tupolev SB bombers which had been flown by defecting Nationalist pilots. In September 1940 another one defected, piloted by the crew of Captain Zhang Diqin and Lieutenants Tang Houlian and Liang Wenhua. They were given a substantial monetary reward for their defections.
An entirely new uniform was designed for the Air Force but were restricted to the officers in command positions. It consisted of a khaki peaked cap, wool jacket with open collar worn with a white shirt and a black tie, along with khaki wool slacks worn with leather shoes. The peaked cap had a gold band round it and a golden woven cap badge with a winged propeller mounted on a wreath.
Police.
The Japanese raised various local police and militia units to maintain order. Many of these organizations were given names such as "pacification committee" or others. In northern China, there were 63,000 local police officers, or about 130 per district. In addition there was an internal security police which consisted of 72,000 men, or about 200 per district, although its role was ambiguous. Sources report that different militias reached a total strength of about 200,000 in north China, although they were very poorly armed. Other militias included rural and volunteer guards, which were collectively known as the "Peace Preservation Corps".
In Shanghai, the "Great Way Government" set up its own police force to keep public order in the city following the retreat of the Nationalist Army after the Battle of Shanghai. The first police were established under the leadership of Zhang Songlin, the former Jiangsu provincial police commander. Taxes were levied on imports and exports to provide the funding for this new force. This new Shanghai police force accepted anyone, including former criminals that had been released by the retreating Nationalists, and thus it was considered totally unreliable by the Japanese. It was recorded of having committed many crimes and was encouraged to rob citizens of their money because they were paid almost nothing. The police often looked the other way when crimes were being committed by others in return for bribes. Efforts to improve its performance included the setting up of a cadet training course which took in 300 cadets. It grew from an initial strength of 64 men upon its creation in 1938 to 6,125 personnel by February 1939, and had 11 branch bureaus, 5 police stations, and 8 special units, including a training center, river police corps, and a hospital. The Shanghai police continued to function after the creation of Wang Jingwei's government and the dissolution of the Great Way municipal authority, and further increased to 7,501 as of January 1941.
A Gendarmerie Command was also organized in Beijing.

There were numerous other collaborationist units that operated in other parts of China under the Japanese. The most notable were the armed forces of the separate puppet state of Manchukuo, along with minor units, such as the early East Hebei Army (1935–37, later merged with the Provisional Government Army), and the Inner Mongolian Army, mainly operating in the puppet state of Mengjiang (which was made an autonomous region of the Reorganized National Government, but was de facto independent).

Bisset

Bisset is a surname of Scottish origin.
History.
Sir Thomas Gray in his Scalacronica states that William the Lion in 1174, on his return from captivity in Falaise and in England, brought back young Englishmen of family to seek their fortune in the Scottish Court; and among these were named the "Biseys". The first of the name recorded in Scotland is Henricus Byset, who witnessed a charter by William the Lion granted before 1198. His son, John Byset, who witnessed a charter by Henry de Graham in 1204, was the individual who obtained from the king the grant of lands in the north.
In 1242 the power of the Bissets was brought to a sudden end, though they still continued to be a family of importance. At a tournament held at Haddington in that year Walter Byset, lord of Aboyne, was worsted by the young earl of Atholl. In revenge Byset is stated to have burned the house in which the earl slept, and the earl with it. For this crime Walter Byset and his nephew, John Byset (founder of the Priory of Beauly in 1231), were exiled the kingdom, their property devolving to others of the family. At the desire of Sir William Byset and to free him of suspicion of guilt, Ralph, bishop of Aberdeen excommunicated those who had partaken of the murder of the earl at Haddington:
Bissets still flourish in Aberdeenshire and Moray. The surname is a personal one, a diminutive of bis, OF. for "rock dove." Basok 1583, Beceit 1429, Besack 1677, Besate 1408, Besek 1584, Beset 1362, Biscet 1292, Biseth 1231, Bissait 1529, Bissaite 1468, Bissart 1542, Bissat 1579, Bissate 1543, Bissed 1640, Bissott 1674, Bizet 1686, Byssot 1489. A spelling of 1294, Buset, almost represents the present Gaelic pronunciation, Buiseid.
At the time of the British Census of 1881, its relative frequency was highest in Aberdeenshire (rate of 1:473), closely followed by Kincardineshire (rate of 1:474), Fife, Perthshire, Ross-shire, Linlithgowshire, Haddingtonshire, Forfarshire, Edinburghshire and Elginshire.

Nomarski prism

A Nomarski prism is a modification of the Wollaston prism that is used in differential interference contrast microscopy. It is named after its inventor, Polish and naturalized-French physicist Georges Nomarski. Like the Wollaston prism, the Nomarski prism consists of two birefringent crystal wedges (e.g. quartz or calcite) cemented together at the hypotenuse (e.g. with Canada balsam). One of the wedges is identical to a conventional Wollaston wedge and has the optical axis oriented parallel to the surface of the prism. The second wedge of the prism is modified by cutting the crystal so that the optical axis is oriented obliquely with respect to the flat surface of the prism. The Nomarski modification causes the light rays to come to a focal point outside the body of the prism, and allows greater flexibility so that when setting up the microscope the prism can be actively focused.

Eodicynodon Assemblage Zone

The "Eodicynodon" Assemblage Zone is a tetrapod assemblage zone or biozone which correlates to the Abrahamskraal Formation, Adelaide Subgroup of the Beaufort Group, a fossiliferous and geologically important geological Group of the Karoo Supergroup in South Africa. The thickest outcrops, reaching approximately , occur south-east of Sutherland, north of Prince Albert, and south-east of Beaufort West. The "Eodicynodon" Assemblage Zone is the lowermost biozone of the Beaufort Group.
The name of the biozone refers to "Eodicynodon oosthuizeni", a small to medium-sized herbivorous dicynodont therapsid. It is characterized by the presence of this dicynodont genus along with the "Nyaphulia", and the dinocephalian "Tapinocaninus pamelae".
History.
The first fossils to be found in the Beaufort Group rocks that encompass the current eight biozones were discovered by Andrew Geddes Bain in 1856. However, it was not until 1892 that it was observed that the geological strata of the Beaufort Group could be differentiated based on their fossil taxa. The initial undertaking was done by Harry Govier Seeley who subdivided the Beaufort Group into three biozones, which he named (from oldest to youngest):
These proposed biozones Seeley named were subdivided further by Robert Broom between 1906 and 1909. Broom proposed the following biozones (from oldest to youngest):
These biozone divisions were approved by paleontologists of the time and were left largely unchanged for several decades. The rocks composing the current "Eodicynodon" Assemblage Zone were previously included in the upper Waterford Formation of the underlying Ecca Group. This was due to prior observations of the biozone rock colours not being consistent with the known reddish to purple colours that are diagnostic of the Beaufort Group. After further stratigraphic reorganization of the Beaufort Group was conducted from the 1970s, it was discovered that the "Eodicynodon" Assemblage Zone correlated with the lower Abrahamskraal Formation, the lowermost geological formation of the Beaufort Group, and that the fossils of "Eodicynodon sp." were only known from these specific rocks. The "Eodicynodon" Assemblage Zone is currently accepted as the oldest biozone of the Beaufort Group.
Lithology.
The "Eodicynodon" Assemblage Zone correlates with the lower Abrahamskraal Formation, Adelaide Subgroup of the Beaufort Group.Outcrops of this biozone are only known from the south-western margins of the Abrahamskraal Formation and is considered to be Middle Permian (Guadalupian) in age.
The rocks of the "Eodicynodon" Assemblage Zone comprise mudstones, siltstones, and fine-grained, siliceous sandstone. The mudstones are olive green to moderate yellowish brown in colour and contain thinner light reddish-brown layers. The reddish-brown layers frequently contain calcareous nodules. Desiccation cracks - indicative of seasonal dry periods - and raindrop impressions are sometimes found in the mudstone layers. Argillaceous layers are also common. The siltstones are extremely fine-grained, often containing ripple marks from being deposited in low energy streams, and vary from being dark grey, greenish-grey, and blueish-grey in colour. Thin sheets of chert occur in the mudstone and less commonly in the siltstone layers. The sandstones are fine-grained and vary from being greyish olive green to dark yellowish brown. Some sandstone layers either contain or are capped by pebble-sized mudstone-clast conglomerates. These conglomerates also contain isolated fossils in some localities. The sandstones are more common and at their thickest towards the upper sections of the biozone. The rocks of this biozone were likely deposited in a subaerial deltaic environment which included floodplains. The presence of calcareous nodules also indicates that the environment was warm with seasonal dry periods.
The depositional environment of the "Eodicynodon" Assemblage Zone was formed by sedimentary material being deposited in the Karoo Basin - a retro-arc foreland basin - by vast, low-energy alluvial plains flowing northwards from a southerly source area in the rising the Gondwanide mountains. The Gondwanides were the result of crustal uplift that had previously begun to take course due to subduction of the Palaeo-pacific plate beneath the Gondwanan Plate. Orogenic pulses from the growing Gondwanides mountain chain and associated subduction created accommodation space for sedimentation in the Karoo Basin where the deposits of the "Eodicynodon" Assemblage zone, and all other succeeding assemblage zones, were deposited over millions of years.
Paleontology.
The "Eodicynodon" Assemblage Zone is characterized by the presence of the dicynodont species "Eodicynodon" and the dinocephalian "Tapinocaninus pamelae". The biozone is not especially fossiliferous with the fossils of dicynodonts "Eodicynodon sp". and the dinocephalians "Tapinocaninus" and "Australosyodon nyaphuli" being most commonly found. The preservation of these fossil taxa are good with the majority of fossils being found in the mudstone layers. This is especially true of the reddish-brown mudstones containing calcareous nodules. Interestingly, dinocephalian fossils have been more commonly found in the sandstones, and fossil fragments have been found in the mudstone-clast conglomerates. However, tantalizing remains of more numerous fossil species have been found to date, hinting at the true level of fossil diversity that could be discovered in the future. The fragmented material includes the scales of the fish "Namaichthys digitata""," species of temnospondyl amphibians, and skull material of gorgonopsids. Rarer fossils encountered in this biozone include skull material of therocephalians, various anomodonts such as "Patranomodon nyaphulii", trace fossils of planolites and arthropod trackways, molluscs, and the plant remains of "Glossopteris symmetrifolia", "Equisetum modderdriftensis," and "Schizoneura africana".

Tongzhou mutiny

The Tongzhou mutiny (), sometimes referred to as the Tongzhou Massacre, was an assault on Japanese civilians and troops by the security forces of East Hebei Autonomous Government in Tongzhou, China, on 29 July 1937, shortly after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which triggered the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Approximately 260 Japanese and Korean residents were killed in the assault. This event escalated tensions between China and Japan, contributing to the further deterioration of relations following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident.
Background.
Tongzhou was the capital of Tongxian (now the northern part of Tongzhou District, Beijing) and was located about 30 km east of Beiping (now Beijing). As a result of the Japanese operation to divide the five provinces of North China for political purposes, Tongzhou became the capital of the East Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Government, established by Yin Ju-keng, who declared autonomy from the Kuomintang government in Nanjing.
At the time, the main force of the Japanese army defending Tongzhou had been deployed, and only a small unit with poor combat capabilities remained in Tongzhou. The Japanese army considered the East Hebei Autonomous Government's security forces defending Tongzhou to be friendly forces, so the attack was an unexpected event.
There are various theories about the reason for the incident.
On July 7, three weeks before the Tongzhou Incident, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out, in which Song Zheyuan's 29th Army clashed with the Japanese garrison in China.
Originally, the Tanggu Agreement of May 1933 established a demilitarized zone to avoid military conflict between Japan and China, prohibiting both sides from entering, and the Chinese police force was to maintain public order. For this reason, the security force was mainly made up of Han Chinese and horse bandits who had fled from Manchuria to avoid the Japanese army, and these were commonly called "miscellaneous troops."
The East Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Government was established as a result of Japan's efforts to separate North China, which was still seeking to expand its influence in the region.[8] Led by Yin Ju-keng, a pro-Japanese graduate of Waseda University, the Self-Government Declaration was announced in Tongzhou on November 25, 1935, and in December the autonomous government began to operate, with two autonomous government security forces established. In opposition to the East Hebei Autonomous Government, the Kuomintang government established the East Hebei Administrative Affairs Committee (Jidong Government) (chairman: Song Zheyuan).
The East Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Government's Security Forces were a security force that was trained by soldiers dispatched from the Japanese Army's China Garrison, and were made up of the Training Corps and five General Corps, the First, Second, Third, and Fourth. In reality, they were paramilitary organizations, but in principle they were called the Security Forces, as an organization for maintaining public order. Although some of the aforementioned "miscellaneous forces" still had strong anti-Japanese sentiments, many of them were employed as part of the Security Forces in order to avoid conflict with them. Within Tongzhou city, one division of the First Security Forces General Division (Commander: Zhang Qingyu) and one division of the Training General Division (Commander: Yin Ju-Keng, Deputy Commander: Zhang Qingyu) were stationed, while one division of the Second Security Forces General Division (Commander: Zhang Yantian) was stationed outside the city. The Second Division of the First Security Forces General Division was also equipped with heavy machine guns and field artillery. However, the unit was formed from part of the former Northeast Army (Chinese version), and anti-Japanese sentiment was by no means favorable, and some of the troops were cadres with strong anti-Japanese sentiment, anti-Japanese units, and bandits.[12][15] At around 7 p.m. on November 20, 1936, about 400 men from the 5th and 6th companies of the Changli Security Force stopped their locomotives on the Beining Railway between Tongzhi and Kaiping, and abducted Major Furuta Ryuzo, commander of the Shanhaiguan garrison, Captain Matsuo Shinichi, commander of the Luanxian garrison, Captain Nagamatsu Kyoichi, medical doctor Katagi Eikyu, and Kazue Kusumi, along with 10 other Japanese passengers.[16][17] The rebellion was put down, but Major Furuta took responsibility and committed seppuku.[16][18]
In Tongzhou, like the Western powers, Japanese troops were stationed for the purpose of protecting Japanese residents, based on the Beijing Protocol following the Boxer Rebellion. This Tongzhou unit was originally intended to be stationed in Tongzhou, but Vice Minister of the Army Umezu Yoshijiro strongly opposed it, stating that stationing in Tongzhou, far from the Beijing-Tianjin Line, was not permitted under the spirit of the Beijing Protocol. Instead, the unit was stationed in Fengtai, southwest of Beiping.[19] At the time of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, about 45 members of a platoon (platoon leader: Lieutenant Fujio Shinichi) of the China Garrison Infantry First Battalion and seven members of the Tongzhou Military Police were stationed in Tongzhou, and on the night of July 18, the China Garrison Infantry Second Regiment (regiment commander: Lieutenant Colonel Kayashima Takashi) arrived from Tianjin and stayed at Tongzhou Normal School.[20] According to the "Development of Operational Plans for the China Garrison Army" dated July 15, 1937, supply bases were established in Tongzhou and Fengtai in preparation for the "First Phase of the Clean-up Campaign" [note 1], and it was assumed that the combat command post would advance to Tongzhou or Fengtai between battles [note 2].
At the time of the Tongzhou Incident, the main force of the Japanese Second Regiment, which was defending Tongzhou, was deployed to Nanyuan, south of Beijing, and there were only personnel in Tongzhou who were not combat-capable [8]. Japan considered the Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Government Security Force to be a friendly force [8].
Causes.
There are several views as to the cause of the mutiny of the East Hebei Army.
Aftermath.
In addition to Japanese military personnel, approximately 260 non-Chinese civilians living in Tongzhou in accordance with the Boxer Protocol of 1901 were killed in the uprising. An American journalist who visited the site reported that 117 Japanese and 106 Korean civilians were killed; Chiang Kai-shek's private diaries (published in the 1970s) recorded 104 Japanese and 108 Korean casualties. Approximately 60 foreign civilians survived and they provided both journalists and later historians with firsthand witness accounts. The Chinese set fire to and destroyed much of the city.
Anti-Chinese sentiments were further intensified in Japan. The popular Japanese slogan in those days was "To punish China the outrageous", or its shorter version . The Japanese military adventurists stationed in China used this incident to justify further military operations under the pretext of protecting Japanese lives and properties in and around Beijing. After World War II the Japanese defense team at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal) submitted the official statement made in 1937 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan as the inevitable cause of the Sino-Japanese conflicts, but presiding judge Sir William Webb KBE rejected it as evidence.

Joel Lynch

Joel John Lynch (born 3 October 1987) is a professional footballer who plays as a defender for UAE Second Division League club Precision. He previously played for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Nottingham Forest, Huddersfield Town and Queens Park Rangers. Born in England, he has represented the Wales national team.
Club career.
Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.
Lynch came through Brighton &amp; Hove Albion's youth set up and was part of a history breaking youth team which saw them reach the quarter-finals of the FA Youth Cup. His reward, along with teammate Joe Gatting, was a place in the squad for the first team which saw him make his debut against Southampton on 3 January 2006.
In summer 2006, Lynch signed a professional three-year contract with Brighton, a deal which was later extended.
Lynch attracted the interest of several Premier League and Championship clubs during his career with Brighton, with Nottingham Forest and Portsmouth keeping a close scrutiny on the player.
After starting the 2008–09 season out of the Brighton first-team, Lynch handed in a written transfer request which was formally rejected by the club. Lynch then handed in a second written transfer request during September 2008 and Brighton reluctantly allowed him to join Nottingham Forest on loan, initially for a month.
He made only one start and two substitute appearances for Brighton in the 2008–09 season.
Lynch made a total of 68 league starts for Brighton and scored a total of two goals.
Nottingham Forest.
Loan spell 2008–09.
Lynch joined Nottingham Forest on loan in September 2008. After five appearances, the following month this loan spell was extended until 28 December, then the loan deal was further extended to keep Lynch at the City Ground for the remainder of the season. Forest paid the player's contractual wages and paid Brighton a fee of £25,000 where he made 23 appearances for Forest. He found himself playing at left full-back, covering for the long term absence through injury of Julian Bennett.
2009–10 season.
On 21 July 2009, Lynch was signed permanently by Forest on a three-year contract for a fee of £200,000. As part of this transfer deal, Forest loaned midfielder Matt Thornhill to Brighton for an initial six months. Lynch's first team opportunities at Forest were limited, especially in his favoured position of centre-back as he has been down the pecking order to Wes Morgan, Kelvin Wilson and Luke Chambers. He has also suffered from injuries. Most of his appearances have come from filling in at left full-back. In the 2009–10 season, Lynch made only 11 starts in all competitions (3 at centre-back; 8 at left-back).
2010–11 season.
Lynch made his first appearance of the 2010–11 season playing 101 minutes in Forest's Football League Cup first round exit to League Two side Bradford City on 10 August 2010 when they lost 2–1 after extra time. His first appearance in the league didn't come until 20 November 2010 when he was used as an 85th-minute substitute in the sides 2–0 away win over Cardiff City. He made his first league start in a 1–0 away win over Ipswich Town on 3 January 2011 being substituted in the 81st minute and would go on to start Forest's next five games. Lynch would only play 15 times during the 2010–11 season making only 11 starts in all competitions and playing mostly at left back over his more natural centre back position.
2011–12 season.
During the 2011–12 season, he was given a chance to play in his preferred position in the centre of defence, alongside Wes Morgan, then Luke Chambers when Morgan joined Leicester City. He put in a series of very impressive displays and began to regularly hold down a starting place and showing signs of fulfilling his potential. On 19 November, Lynch scored his first goal for Nottingham Forest in the 3–2 win against Ipswich Town. His second came in a 2–1 loss to Middlesbrough, and his third was a header against former club Brighton.
Huddersfield Town.
On 11 July 2012, Lynch signed a 3-year deal with Huddersfield Town after turning down a new deal at former club Forest becoming manager Simon Grayson's fifth signing of 2012–13 season. Lynch was given the number 33 shirt for the 2012–13 season by manager Simon Grayson on 14 July 2012. He made his league début in the 1–0 defeat by Cardiff City at the Cardiff City Stadium on 17 August. On 25 August he scored his first goal in a league match against Burnley when he gave Huddersfield a 1–0 lead, where Huddersfield won 2–0 in the end. Lynch received his first red card of his Huddersfield career at Hillsborough Stadium in Huddersfield's 3–1 win over Sheffield Wednesday.
Lynch's first goal of the 2013–14 season came in the 3–2 League Cup win against Charlton Athletic on 27 August 2013. Less than a month later Lynch would again score against Charlton, this time in League action on 17 September, before picking up a red card against Reading on 14 December. 15 days later Lynch scored again, this time in a 5–1 rout against Yeovil Town. On 12 April 2014 Lynch received his second red card of the season, this time on 12 April 2014 against Derby County in what proved to be Lynch's penultimate appearance of the season.
His first goal of the 2014–15 season came against former club Nottingham Forest, just 43 seconds into their Championship clash on 1 November 2014.
Queens Park Rangers.
On 29 June 2016, Lynch joined fellow Football League Championship side Queens Park Rangers on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £1.2 million, potentially rising to £1.5 million. He scored his first goal for QPR in a 2–1 loss to Wolverhampton Wanderers on 1 December 2016.
Sunderland.
Following release from QPR, Lynch joined League One side Sunderland. On 17 June 2020, the club confirmed Lynch would be leaving.
Crawley Town.
On 7 September 2021, Lynch signed for EFL League Two club Crawley Town on a contract until 3 January 2022. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2-2 draw with Harrogate Town on 21 September 2021.
On 13 August 2023, it was announced that Lynch had left Crawley after he agreed to terminate his contract with the club.
Precision Football.
Following his departure, Lynch joined UAE Third Division League club Precision Football, founded by former Brighton &amp; Hove Albion academy teammate Sonny Cobbs. During the 2023–24 season, Lynch scored five goals as the club were promoted. He signed a new contract with the club in August 2024.
International career.
Born and raised in England, Lynch qualified for Wales through his father who was born in Barry. On 17 May 2012, Lynch was called up to the Wales squad for a friendly match against Mexico. He was a substitute, but did not feature in the match. On 12 August 2012 Lynch received his second international call up to the Wales squad for the friendly with Bosnia and Herzegovina. He made his debut as a 78th-minute substitute in that game on 15 August 2012.

Britain's Real Monarch

Britain's Real Monarch is a historical documentary presented by Tony Robinson first shown on Channel 4 on 3 January 2004. It has also been broadcast in Australia and in the United States. The documentary discusses the descendants of George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence, and their claim to the throne of England.
Thesis.
The programme based its thesis on the centuries-old claim that Edward IV was illegitimate, born to Cecily, Duchess of York, by an English archer (surnamed Blaybourne by some) while her husband, Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, was fighting elsewhere in France. The legitimacy of Edward IV was the subject of speculation at the time, and a document in Rouen Cathedral is presented by Dr Michael Jones as indicating that Richard and Cecily were about apart during the five-week period when Edward's conception must have occurred (assuming that the pregnancy went to a normal term). A number of historians have since challenged the conclusions reached by the programme.
If Edward were indeed illegitimate, then he and his descendants would have had no valid claim to the throne, so the programme suggests that the 'real' monarchs were the heirs of his legitimate brother George, Duke of Clarence. At the time, this line was represented by The 14th Earl of Loudoun (who usually styled himself simply as Michael Hastings), who had emigrated to Australia in 1960, married, fathered five children, and lived in Jerilderie, New South Wales, until his death in June 2012.

Felice Borel

Felice Placido Borel (; 5 April 1914 – 21 February 1993) was an Italian football player who played as a striker. He was a member of the Italy national football team that won the 1934 FIFA World Cup.
Club career.
Borel was born in Nice, France. During his career, he played for Juventus and cross-city rivals Torino in Serie A and, in Serie B, for Alessandria, and finally for S.S.C. Napoli, where he finished his career.
He scored 158 goals for Juventus, winning three Serie A titles (1933, 1934, and 1935) and a Coppa Italia (1938) during his time with the club, as well as the Serie A top-scorer award on two occasions (1933 and 1934); he is currently Juventus's sixth highest goal scorer. During his second spell with the club in the 1940s, he held the position of player-manager.
He still holds the record for most goals, in winning the Capocannoniere/Top scorer title, in Serie A while playing for Juventus with 31 goals. Although Ferenc Hirzer still holds the record for most goals in winning the Capocannoniere/Top scorer title, in the Best Italian League while playing for Juventus with 35 goals (in only 24 matches) but then it was called Prima Divisione.
International career.
Borel made three appearances for the Italy national team between 1933 and 1934, scoring his only international goal on his debut against Hungary on 22 November, in Budapest, during the gold winning 1933-35 Central European International Cup campaign. He was part of the 1934 FIFA World Cup winning national team, appearing once throughout the tournament, during the quarter-final victory over Spain on 1 June.
Style of play.
Nicknamed "farfallino" ("little butterfly," in Italian), Borel usually played as a centre-forward, and is regarded as one of Italy's and Juventus's greatest forwards of all time. He was known for his speed, movement, shooting, goalscoring, dribbling, team-play, and technical ability. In his later career he usually played as an inside forward or "mezzala", or even as an offensive–minded central midfielder. Despite his ability, however, he was also injury prone.
After retirement.
During the 1958–59 season, he was technical director of Catania.
Personal life.
Felice's older brother Aldo Borel played football professionally, spending 10 seasons in the Serie A, and their father Ernesto Borel played for OGC Nice, AS Cannes and Juventus in the 1900s and 1910s, and later also served as a manager. To distinguish the brothers, Aldo was known as Borel I and Felice - as Borel II.

British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy

The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) is a professional body for counsellors and psychotherapists practising in the United Kingdom.
History.
Originally founded in 1977 as the British Association for Counselling, aided by a grant from the Home Office Voluntary Service Unit, it had emerged from the Standing Conference for the Advancement of Counselling. This body was inaugurated in 1970 at the instigation of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. It was co-founded by the humanist activist Harold Blackham, and drew on detailed work Blackham had done for a non-religious counselling service for the British Humanist Association, which he led at the time. The organisation's Chair was Nicholas Tyndall, Chief Officer at the National Marriage Guidance Council (which later become Relate).
In 1978, the headquarters were relocated from London to Rugby courtesy of the National Marriage Guidance Council which provided free accommodation to help the association establish itself. The Association is now located in Lutterworth.
In September 2000, the Association recognised that it no longer represented only those involved in counselling, but also psychotherapy, and changed its name to the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.
In September 2017, the branding was refreshed introducing a new logo, colour scheme, typeface and the slogan "counselling changes lives", based on a belief in the impact and benefits of the profession. This was Highly Commended in the 2018 memcom membership excellence awards stating that it "found success over various mediums" and "had a clear rationale for the brand relaunch and a strong proposition that counselling changes lives".
In November 2019, the membership was reported to have surpassed 50,000, prompting the Association to share celebratory and rewarding comments from its members as a way to mark the achievement. Individual members pay £178 per year for membership. 
In October 2024, investigations led by the i newspaper showed that regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists was inadequate and exposed vulnerable members of the public to exploitation by 'rogue therapists'. These concerns were echoed by leading mental health campaigners and by members of the UK Parliament. Tougher regulation was called for.
Governance.
BACP is a company limited by guarantee and a registered charity, monitored by the Charity Commission to ensure that aims are charitable and funds used for the benefit of the public and in particular, those who receive counselling and psychotherapy, and for public education. BACP follows the Charity Commission's Charity Governance Code as a tool for continuous improvement.
The governing instrument is the Memorandum and Articles of the Association.
The Trustees, known collectively as the Board of Governors, govern the Association.
Committees.
BACP operates four governance committees to oversee the activities of the association:
Operations.
BACP works with commissioners and government to promote the counselling professions, seeking to advise and inform national and international policy and procedures concerned with counselling and psychotherapy, offering information and guidance to involved parties. BACP is consulted by government bodies, professional bodies, funding organisations, teaching institutions and many others on important issues concerning counselling and psychotherapy.
The Association sets and maintains standards for the profession. The Ethical Framework for Good Practice in Counselling and Psychotherapy along with the Professional Conduct Procedure is intended to ensure that members of BACP abide by an accepted code of conduct and accountability. The Association accredits counsellors with the appropriate training and experience via a rigorous accreditation process that requires continued education to maintain accreditation. The BACP has a Professional Conduct Procedure for complaints made against members and publishes details of all complaints upheld under the Professional Conduct Procedure where it believes it is appropriate to do in the interests of public protection.
In October 2015, the Collaboration" of the "Counselling and Psychotherapy Professions (CCPP) was announced between BACP, BPC and UKCP. Whilst promising to maintain their unique differences, each organisation expressed their recognition of shared goals and a commitment to improving the nation's mental health and wellbeing.
In June 2017, BACP presented their Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) research as a paper at the Society for Psychotherapy Research conference in Canada. Key research papers, including the FGM paper and a paper analysing data from the National Audit of Psychological Therapies, were published gold open access.
In March 2018, BACP and the SQA announced a unique partnership which promises to improve access to the counselling profession for students in Scotland through a new BACP Approved Qualification scheme.
Strategic priorities.
Following consultation with their members and stakeholders, BACP identified three key areas for particular focus where the value of counselling has the greatest potential to improve lives.
Specialist interest divisions.
BACP represent and promote specialist areas of interest within the profession by operating seven divisions, each managed by an executive committee of volunteers which run their own meetings and formulate strategies in line with BACP objectives, overseen by the BACP Board of Governors.
Regulation.
Although counselling and psychotherapy are not statutorily regulated professions, BACP works alongside other associations to advise and appeal to government in attempts to ensure members of the public who access the counselling professions are safeguarded.
The BACP is registered for accreditation under the scheme set up by the Department of Health and regulated by the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care. The Accredited status of the BACP Register is reviewed annually by the Professional Standards Authority to ensure that the highest standards are being met and good practices are being followed. 
During October 2024 newspapers in Britain signalled the inadequacy of regulation of therapists after an investigation. It showed that some therapists and counsellors, including at least one GP, were able to set up in practice after having been struck off for misconduct by their member organisations, such as the BACP and UKCP. Misconduct was reported to include drug and sexual abuse. The majority of perpetrators were male practitioners exploiting female clients. Campaigners and MPs have called for stronger measures to protect the public.
Publications.
"Therapy Today".
The organisation's "Therapy Today" magazine, with a circulation of 44,386 (ABC Jan – Dec 2016), is the most widely read specialist magazine for counsellors and psychotherapists in the UK, and has a strong international presence, publishing articles on topics crossing the breadth of counselling and psychotherapy practice, modalities and theoretical approaches.
Journals.
The BACP publishes eight member-only journals:

Astereae

Astereae is a tribe of plants in the family Asteraceae that includes annuals, biennials, perennials, subshrubs, shrubs, and trees. They are found primarily in temperate regions of the world. Plants within the tribe are present nearly worldwide divided into over 250 genera and more than 3,100 species, making it the second-largest tribe in the family behind Senecioneae.
The taxonomy of the tribe Astereae has been dramatically changed after both morphologic and molecular evidence suggested that large genera such as "Aster", as well as many others, needed to be separated into several genera or shifted to better reflect the plants' relationships. A paper by R. D. Noyes and L. H. Rieseberg showed that most of the genera within the tribe in North America actually belong to a single clade, meaning they have a common ancestor. This is referred to as the North American clade. Guy L. Nesom and Harold E. Robinson have been involved in the recent work and are continuing to re-categorise the genera within the tribe worldwide.
Subtribes.
, tribe Astereae is divided into 36 accepted subtribes.

Ecca Group

The Ecca Group is the second of the main subdivisions of the Karoo Supergroup of geological strata in southern Africa. It mainly follows conformably after the Dwyka Group in some sections, but in some localities overlying unconformably over much older basement rocks. It underlies the Beaufort Group in all known outcrops and exposures. Based on stratigraphic position, lithostratigraphic correlation, palynological analyses, and other means of geological dating, the Ecca Group ranges between Early to earliest Middle Permian (Asselian - Roadian) in age.
Background.
During the time of the deposition of the Ecca Group, the depositional environment, with some exceptions, was predominantly marine. The Ecca sea was vast but shallow, reaching only around 500 m at its deepest in its west/northwestern and southern facies where the Tanqua and Laingsburg Depocenters are situated respectively. The marine environment ranged from deep pelagic, submarine fan systems in the lower deposits which grade steadily north-eastwards to shallow marine deposits including shelf (continental) marine and marginal marine facies, and finally to beach deposits in younger successions. Coal-bearing fluvial-deltaic, and peatbog settings are also well known from the Ecca Group.
The Ecca Group was deposited in a vast retroarc foreland basin. This foreland system was caused by crustal uplift (orogenesis) that had previously begun to take course due to the subduction of the Palaeo-pacific plate beneath the Gondwanan Plate. This resulted in the rise of the Gondwanide mountain range in what is known as the Gondwanide orogeny. The mountain-building and erosion caused by the growing Gondwanide mountain range was the initial subsidence mechanism acting on the Karoo Basin. Flexural tectonics partitioned the Karoo Basin into the foredeep, forebulge, and backbulge flexural provinces. This resulted in deposition of the Karoo Basin.
Geographic extent.
The rocks of the Ecca Group first appear near Sutherland in its westernmost deposits, and continues east through Laingsburg, Prince Albert, Jansenville, Grahamstown, and up until the coast near Port Alfred. In the central north deposits are found near Britstown, running along the Orange River between Petrusville and Hopetown. In the extreme northeast deposits are found east of Johannesburg past Vryheid, Durban, Pietermaritzburg and all the way down to Port St. Johns in the southeast.
Stratigraphic units.
The Ecca Group comprises sixteen recognized geological formations. These individual formations have been grouped into three geographical areas, which are the southern, western/northwestern, and northeastern facies successions. In the east of South Africa there are deposits of as of yet undifferentiated mudstone sequences attributed to the Ecca Group.
With the exception of the Prince Albert, Whitehill, Collingham, and the uppermost Waterford Formations which are found in both the southern and western/northwestern facies, the geological formations of the Ecca Group can only be found in one of the three previously aforementioned facies successions. This is because each of these facies successions represents differing preserved environments that can be observed in their diagnostic geological features. The facies successions, along with their geological formations, are described below:
Western/Northwestern Ecca facies
This facies succession is purely marine. The rocks contain a complete transition, grading laterally into one other, from basin-floor marine deposits through to channelized submarine slope to shelf, pro-delta and beach environment deposits. The deposits of the western/northwestern facies fall within the Tanqua Depocenter, one of the vast submarine fan systems known from the marine Ecca. Associated formations are listed below (from oldest to youngest):
Southern Ecca facies
This facies succession is the largest of the three facies succession. Its lowermost formations are deep marine comprising basin floor pelagic sediments and submarine fan systems that grade upwards into channelized submarine slopes to shelf marine and beach environments. The Laingsburg Depocenter is found in this facies succession and include the following formations (from oldest to youngest):
Northeastern Ecca facies
The northeastern facies is shallow marine in its lowermost and uppermost sections, and then changes to coal-bearing fluvial-deltaic peat swamp settings in its central deposits. The northern facies often overlies unconformably on much older basement rocks unlike the other facies of the Ecca Group. It comprises three geological formations (from oldest to youngest):
Correlation.
The lower geological formations of the Ecca Group, particularly the rocks of the Whitehill Formation, correlate in age with the Huab Basin of northwestern Namibia, and lower formations of the Kalahari Basin found in Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. Near the small town of Khorixas in Namibia there is a locally well-known national monument called the Petrified Forest. Petrified logs were brought into the area and are considered to have been sourced from the nearby deposits of the Huab Basin.
Abroad, Ecca-aged deposits are known from the Paraná Basin of Brazil and the Petolas Basin of both Brazil and Uruguay where fossils of "Mesosaurus" and "Glossopteris" have also been recovered. Finally, geological dating has also proven the lower Ecca formations to correlate with the Barnett Shale and Marcellus Formation of the United States.

Goudy Old Style

Goudy Old Style (also known as just Goudy) is an old-style serif typeface originally created by Frederic W. Goudy for American Type Founders (ATF) in 1915.
Suitable for text and display applications, Goudy Old Style matches the historicist trend of American printing in the early twentieth century, taking inspiration from the printing of the Italian Renaissance without a specific historical model. Eccentricities include the upward-curved ear on the g and the diamond shape of the dots of the i, j, and the points found in the period, colon and exclamation point, and the sharply canted hyphen. The design is relatively light in colour.
History.
In Goudy's autobiography, he described the italic based on study of sixteenth-century italics: "I studied many of the older italics and came to the conclusion that...some of the outstanding italics of the sixteenth century had little or no inclination and yet preserved their italic character".
Several variants, designed by several designers, were released in the ensuing years (all faces ATF unless otherwise specified).
By Goudy:
By Morris Fuller Benton:
By others:
The face was an instant best seller, prompting ATF to issue a special 124-page specimen book of the series in 1927. The descenders of Goudy Old Style were kept short at ATF's insistence to allow tight line setting on their common line system, to Goudy's irritation. In addition, he sold the design to ATF for $1500 and received no royalty, causing his relationship with the foundry to deteriorate.
Hot metal copies.
The face was immediately licensed to Lanston Monotype and some of the weights were issued by Intertype as well. Ludlow called its 1924 knock-off the "Number Eleven series". Monotype's designer F.H. Pierpont, better known for Rockwell and Monotype Grotesque, designed a similar face named "Horley Old Style", adding a distinct influence of Caslon designs.
Cold type copies.
As the face was a "classic" almost from the day of its issue, producers of cold type offered their own versions of "Goudy Old Style" under the following names:
Digital copies.
Commercial releases have been made by Monotype, Fontsite, DTP Types, Electric Typographer, Lanston Type, Bitstream, URW++ (bundled with Microsoft Office), Adobe, and Linotype. As many early digitisations were sublicensed, several of these may represent the same digitisation marketed by different rights-holders, possibly upgraded with modern features such as contextual ligature substitution and small caps. LTC's digitisation includes the calligraphic and swash alternate characters, as well as small caps. "Goudy Catalog" has been copied by Scangraphic, Bitstream, URW++, and Elsner+Flake. A version called "Goudy Schoolbook" also exists, with single-story versions of the letters "a" and "g", but it is not for sale to the general public. (The digitisation bundled with Microsoft Office lacks all these features; it does include ligatures, but they must be inserted manually.)
'Sorts Mill Goudy' is an open-source revival created by Barry Schwartz as part of the League of Movable Type project, which contains small capitals and other OpenType features. Bhikkhu Pesala expanded this under the name 'Sukhumala', adding bold, bold italic and handtooled styles.
ATF's other related fonts, Goudy Handtooled and Goudy Catalog, have also been digitised, again with a variety of companies holding some rights although only LTC's release includes Handtooled Italic. Goudy Title has not been digitised under that name.
Usage.
"Goudy Old Style" is the text typeface used in "Harper's Magazine". It is also the typeface used for headings in "The Spectator". It is the official typeface of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland, Oregon, Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina, and Hamilton College in Clinton, New York. It is also used by the National University of Colombia. It is also the standard body text font for Key Club publications. The bold italic weight is used for the wordmark of Whittard's.

Coolavokig ambush

The Coolavokig ambush () was carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) on 25 February 1921, during the Irish War of Independence. It took place at Coolavokig, on the road between Macroom and Ballyvourney, County Cork. A 60-man flying column of the IRA's 1st Cork Brigade under Seán O'Hegarty, ambushed a 70-man convoy of the Auxiliary Division under Major Seafield Grant, sparking a four-hour battle. Ten Auxiliaries were killed, including Major Grant, and others wounded. The IRA column left the area when British reinforcements arrived. After the ambush, British forces stopped carrying out raids and patrols in the area.
Preparations.
The IRA flying column had been attempting to ambush the Auxiliaries for two weeks but had always missed them. As they occupied the ambush position over a few days, their position became known and a force of 70 Auxiliaries and 7 RIC constables moved against them, heavily armed with rifles, machine-guns and grenades. The sixty-two IRA volunteers included units from the 1st, 7th, and 8th battalions of the 1st Cork Brigade, and was divided into four sections. Apart from commander Seán O'Hegarty, the main IRA officers were Dan "Sandow" O'Donovan and Dan Corkery. The IRA was armed with sixty rifles, several shotguns and revolvers, and two Lewis guns, but significantly, no grenades. The British forces, travelling in eight lorries and two cars, also carried four Irish hostages with them.
Battle.
Around 8am on 25 February, IRA scouts signalled the approach of the British force. They were forewarned about the IRA position however, and approached with caution, when a republican leaving his post turned to run back, and was seen from the leading lorry. When half of the lorries came into the ambush position the IRA opened fire. According to "An Cosantóir", one lorry immediately turned around and sped back to Macroom.
Rifles and a Lewis machine-gun from the IRA's no.1 section, and ten rifles from no.4 section, opened fire, as they were the only republican units that had a field of fire on the lorries. They then dropped to the ground to avoid return fire. Sections no.2 and no.3 swung round to the east, on a hillside, in an attempt to encircle the British northern flank, but they could get no closer than 500 yards.
The Auxiliaries were quickly losing ground and taking casualties. Major Grant was killed while rallying his forces. The British forces retreated into two nearby cottages. The IRA closed in and as they were preparing to bomb the cottages, large numbers of RIC reinforcements approached and began encircling the area. After fighting a half-hour rear guard action the IRA flying column retreated towards the north-west. The engagement at Coolavokig lasted four hours, until soldiers of the Manchester Regiment arrived.
Aftermath.
It later transpired that the Auxiliary forces were just part of a large round-up operation planned for that day which included 600 British Army troops from Cork, Ballincollig, Bandon, Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Bantry, Dunmanway, Millstreet, Macroom, and Killarney. After the ambush, British forces ceased raiding and patrolling the area west of Macroom, effectively handing it over to IRA control. They were reluctant to enter the area, and only did so later with a strong force of 2,000 men.
The IRA suffered no casualties. However, the number of British casualties has been disputed to this day. The British claimed that only Major (Auxiliary Commandant) James Seafield-Grant was killed during the ambush, and that two other Auxiliaries later died of their wounds. The IRA claimed that between 14 and 16 members of the British force were killed. The Digest of Service for the 1st Battalion, Manchester Regiment recorded that on 18 March 1921, a party proceeded to Coolavokig to destroy houses believed to have been used by the IRA.

Shigeki Hosokawa

 is a Japanese actor.
Biography.
Shigeki Hosokawa attended Ogaki Municipal North Elementary School and Ogaki Municipal North Junior High School. He then graduated from Ogaki Public High School in 1988. He had his first acting role in a TBS J-Drama (Japanese drama) in 1994. He then made a brief appearance on a variety game show in the same year.
From 1995 to 2000, he was a professional model. He took time off from modeling in 2002 to study acting more thoroughly. He did not go to an acting school after his high school graduation so he used this time to improve his skill. Though mainly a model from 1995 to 2002, he had bit parts in commercials and drama series. One of his more notable roles during his "time off" from acting was as Takeda-sensei, a teacher in the hit live-action adaptation of "GTO".
In late 2004, it was announced that Shigeki Hosokawa would be the lead in the then upcoming season of the long running Kamen Rider franchise, "Kamen Rider Hibiki". He drew fans from both the target demographic of children and house wives alike. His role as Hibiki garnered many good reviews from Japanese critics. After "Kamen Rider Hibiki" finished airing, he then landed the role of Taira no Shigehira in the Samurai Drama, "Yoshitsune". Both "Kamen Rider Hibiki" and "Yoshitsune" aired in the 8:00 time slot, AM and PM respectively. Because both shows aired in different 8 o'clock timeslots, he has been given the nickname "The 8 o'clock man" in Japan. Hosokawa's next major role was that of the ill-fated F.B.I. agent, Raye Iwamatsu, in the live action adaptations of the "Death Note" manga. He then went on to play the father character in the TV movie, Kaigo Etoile ("The Nursing Care Star") which will start its Japanese airing on September 18, 2006. He played the father of the main character. His role is that of an aging and divorced father who has developed dementia.
He played the lead role in a one-hour live action special that served as a prologue to the "Skullman" anime series.
In 2016, Shigeki Hosokawa's contract period of the affiliated office "Samday" was unilaterally canceled, with Hosokawa applying to the Tokyo District Court in January 2017 to protest this sudden cancelation. The next month, a provisional disposition was decided to continue Hosokawa's contract, with it formally ending in May 2017. During and after this time period, the Japanese media would portray Hosokawa in an unpleasant manner, accusing his sudden contract termination as the result of him committing acts of "harassment".
In response to these broadcast, Hosokawa submitted a petition to the BPO in January 2018, stating that "there was a malicious aim to infringe on my honor and credibility." Ultimately, the Tokyo District Court accepted Hosokawa's claim, proving his innocence. However, despite having been a victim of misinformation, Hosokawa's career as an actor was severely affected by this incident, with his reprisal of Hitoshi Hidaka/Kamen Rider Hibiki being a difficult issue altogether.

Life Begins at the Hop

"Life Begins at the Hop" is a song written by Colin Moulding. It was recorded by XTC and released in 1979 as the group's fifth single. Keyboardist Barry Andrews was replaced by second guitarist Dave Gregory prior to its recording. The song recalls Friday night youth dances that Moulding, in his teenage years, had attended at St. Peter's Church in Penhill, Swindon. 
The single's B-side, "Homo Safari" was the first in Andy Partridge's "Homo Safari Series", a six-part series of ambient, impressionistic instrumentals, initially released on the b-sides of various XTC 7" and 12" singles. The song would later be put on the 2014 expanded edition as a bonus track, alongside its A-side, which was also put on the album's original US release, as the opening track.

Milhosť

Milhosť ( or ; ) is a village and municipality in Košice-okolie District in the Košice Region of eastern Slovakia. It is situated 21 km from Slovakia's second biggest city, Košice. Milhosť is surrounded by two neighbouring villages Kechnec and Seňa. Moreover, it is a border crossing village between Hungary (Tornyosnémeti) and Slovakia (Milhosť).
Etymology.
The name comes from a Slavic personal name "Milgost" (see also e.g. "Gemerský Milhosť", "Milhosťov", "Milhostice", "Milhošť"). It got its second name "Németi" (in Hungarian "German") after the arrival German colonists.
Village names:.
History.
The first historical records of Milhosť are from [1220]. At this time German colonists, who came during the years 1205-1209 A.D., were living in this area. The village had not been an independent ham in the 13th century. It was just a settlement which belonged to a village called Középnémeti. The first written record of Milhosť appears in the 14th century, which mentioned a St. Michael´s chapel from 1322,however the chapels' location is not known today. The name of the village changed over the years. It varied from Felsekysnemethy to its present form Milhosť.
Only Germans were living in this area till 1500 AD. At the beginning of the 16th century Hungarian families arrived and as a result the number of the German population decreased. There are no records of German families after 1600 AD but there was an increase in Slovak settlers. In 1720 AD the number of Hungarian and Slovak inhabitants was equal. The arrival of the first Jews began in 1787 and Romani people in the year 1850.
Geography.
The village lies at an altitude of 166 metres and covers an area of 7.782 km².
It has a population of 344 people (2001).
Ethnicity.
Approximately half of the population is Slovak (54.9%) in ethnicity, the other half is Magyar (41.8%) and Romani people.
Culture.
The village has a public library and a petrol station.
A non-professional drama club functions in the village, associated with the CSEMADOK (Csehszlovákiai Magyar Dolgozók Kulturális Szövetsége / Czechoslovak Hungarian Workers´ Cultural Association), with around 10-15 Hungarian speaking members. A variety is performed by them each winter to entertain the villagers. A couple of the members are invited to various occasion to the neighbouring villages, to Hungarian villages as well, to perform small plays or sing.

Mueang Samut Sakhon district

Mueang Samut Sakhon (, ) is the capital district ("amphoe mueang") of Samut Sakhon province, central Thailand.
History.
"Mueang" Tha Chin dates back to the Ayutthaya Kingdom and was once administered by the Ministry of Defence. During his reign, King Maha Chakkraphat ordered the establishment of "Mueang" Sakhon Buri. Later, King Mongkut (Rama IV) renamed the city Samut Sakhon. In 1897, it was formally designated as Mueang Samut Sakhon District.
Despite the official name, locals still commonly refer to Mueang Samut Sakhon as "Mahachai".
In addition to Mahachai, the city is also known by the Teochew name "Lang-Ka-Su" (; pinyin: "Lóng zǐ cuò"), which literally means "home of dragon descendants". This name has been recorded in Chinese historical texts for over a thousand years, suggesting that Samut Sakhon has long been home to Chinese settlers and people of Chinese descent. Its strategic location at the mouth of the Tha Chin River made it a prime site for maritime trade. To this day, Lang-Ka-Su remains a widely recognized informal name for the area.
In September 2013, the wreck of an ancient Arab trading ship was discovered at a shrimp farm in Phanthai Norasing Subdistrict, Mueang Samut Sakhon District. The ship was named the "Phanom-Surin Ship" after the couple who owned the land. It is considered the oldest shipwreck archaeological site ever found in Thailand and Southeast Asia.
The ship is believed to date back to the 9th century, corresponding to the Dvaravati period, and serves as compelling evidence that the Tha Chin River was once a key maritime route linking the Dvaravati Kingdom with the wider world.
Geography.
The general topography of the district is a coastal lowland about 1 meter above sea level. There are no islands, mountains or minerals. The main watercourse of Samut Sakhon, Tha Chin River flows into the Gulf of Thailand at Bang Ya Phraek subdistrict.&lt;br&gt;
Neighbouring districts are (from the west clockwise): Mueang Samut Songkhram of Samut Songkhram province; Ban Phaeo and Krathum Baen of Samut Sakhon province; and Bang Bon and Bang Khun Thian of Bangkok. To the south is the Bay of Bangkok.
Environment.
Samut Sakhon province has more than 6,000 small- and medium-sized factories, many of them in this district. Soil and water samples from the industrial area of Mueang district were found to be contaminated with high levels of arsenic, lead, cadmium, chromium, zinc, copper, and nickel. High levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPS), byproducts of industrial processes, were present in eggs from free-range chickens. An egg tested by researchers was found to have 84 nanograms per kilogram of dioxins and furans, a level 33 times higher than the safety limit observed by the European Union.
Administration.
Provincial government.
The district is divided into 18 subdistricts ("tambons"), which are further subdivided into 116 villages ("mubans").
Local government.
As of December 2024 there are: seven municipalities ("thesaban"), of which Samut Sakhon itself has city status ("thesaban nakhon") and covers the combined area of Mahachai, Tha Chalom and Krokkrak subdistricts. Phanthai Norasing is a town municipality ("thesaban mueang") and covers the whole subdistrict. Bang Pla is a subdistrict municipality ("thesaban tambon") which covers only village 4 of subdistrict Ban Ko. Four subdistricts completely form a subdistrict municipality: Bang Ya Phraek, Na Di, Tha Chin and Khok Krabue. The non-municipal areas are administered by ten subdistrict administrative organizations - SAO ("ongkan borihan suan tambon" - o bo toh).
Healthcare.
Hospitals.
There are in the district: Samut Sakhon Hospital with 600 beds, Ekachai Hospital with 142 beds, Mahachai 3 Hospital with 180 beds, Jesada Vechakarn Hospital with 10 beds and Metropolitan Hospital Tha Chalom.
Health promoting hospitals.
There are total twenty-three health-promoting hospitals in the district, of which; one in every subdistrict, but Ban Bo, Ban Nam Chuet, Khok Kham, Ban Ko, Ban Krachao and Bang Ya Phraek each have two and Phantai Norasing has three.
Religion.
There are seventy Theravada Buddhist temples in the district.&lt;br&gt;
One in Krokkrak, two in Tha Chalom, Na Di, Khok Krabue and Bang Nam Chuet, three in Ka Long, four in Ban Bo, Na Khok, Tha Sai, Khok Kham, Bang Ya Phraek and Chai Mongkhon, five in Mahachai, Tha Chin and Bang Krachao, six in Phanthai Norasing and Ban Ko and seven in Bang Tho Rat.
Transportation.
The district is the intersection of highway 35 eastbound (Bangkok route), highway 35 westbound (Pak Tho district, Ratchaburi province), Ekkachai road (no. 3242) (Chom Thong district, Bangkok).&lt;br&gt;
There is Maeklong Railway a Wongwian Yai - Mahachai train service, starting from Wongwian Yai station, Bangkok, to Mahachai station (distance ) every day from 05.30-20.00 hrs, and a Tha Chalom - Mae Klong train service, starting from Ban Laem station, Tha Chalom subdistrict, to Maeklong station, Samut Songkhram (distance ).

Sediment trap

Sediment traps are instruments used in oceanography and limnology to measure the quantity of sinking particulate organic (and inorganic) material in aquatic systems, usually oceans, lakes, or reservoirs. This flux of material is the product of biological and ecological processes typically within the surface euphotic zone, and is of interest to scientists studying the role of the biological pump in the carbon cycle.
Sediments traps normally consist of an upward-facing funnel that directs sinking particulate matter (e.g. marine snow) towards a mechanism for collection and preservation. Typically, traps operate over an extended period of time (weeks to months) and their collection mechanisms may consist of a series of sampling vessels that are cycled through to allow the trap to record the changes in sinking flux with time (for instance, across a seasonal cycle). Preservation of collected material is necessary because of these long deployments, and prevents sample decomposition and its consumption by zooplankton "swimmers".
Traps are often moored at a specific depth in the water column (usually below the euphotic zone or mixed layer) in a particular location, but some are so-called Lagrangian traps that drift with the surrounding ocean currents (though they may remain at a fixed depth). These latter traps travel with the biological systems that they study, while moored traps are subject to variability introduced by different systems (or states of systems) "passing by". However, because of their fixed location moored traps are straightforward to recover for analysis of their measurements. Lagrangian traps must surface at a predetermined time, and report their position (usually via satellite) in order to be recovered.

Campylognathoides

Campylognathoides is an extinct genus of pterosaur discovered in the Württemberg Lias deposits (dated to the early Toarcian age) of Germany; this first specimen however, consisted only of wing fragments. Further better preserved specimens were found in the Holzmaden shale; based on these specimens, Felix Plieninger erected a new genus.
Discovery.
In 1858 Friedrich August Quenstedt named a new species of "Pterodactylus": "P. liasicus". It was based on a fossil, holotype GPIT 9533, consisting of some wing bones, found on the Wittberg near Metzingen in layers dating from the early Toarcian, about 180 million years old. The specific name referred to the Lias. Quenstedt thought he had identified long metacarpals in the wing, concluding that the new species was therefore not belonging to more basal genera, like the long-tailed "Rhamphorhynchus".
In 1893 commercial fossil collector Bernhard Hauff sr. discovered a skeleton of a large pterosaur near Holzmaden. In 1894 Felix Plieninger based a new genus on this specimen: "Campylognathus". The genus name is derived from Greek "kampylos", "bent", and "gnathos", "jaw", in reference to the bent lower jaw. The type species is "Campylognathus zitteli". The specific name honours Alfred von Zittel. The holotype is SMNS 9787.
In 1897 Hauff prepared another specimen that eventually in 1903 was acquired by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History at Pittsburgh. This fossil, CM 11424, is due to its completeness the best source of information about the genus.
In 1901 Plieninger for the first time studied "P. liasicus" and discovered that Quenstedt had mistaken the, in reality short, metacarpal, for a coracoid, meaning it was a basal pterosaur. In 1906 Plieninger referred "P. liasicus" and the Pittsburgh specimen to "Campylognathus", though not yet establishing the specific status of each of the three exemplars. In 1907 however, Plieninger recognised a second species of "Campylognathus": "C. liasicus", to which CM 11424 was referred also.
Norwegian entomologist Embrik Strand discovered in the 1920s that the name "Campylognathus" had previously been used for the African bug "Campylognathus nigrensis", a genus of the Heteroptera named in 1890. As the name was thus preoccupied, he renamed the pterosaur "Campylognathoides" in 1928.
During the twentieth century new finds have brought the number of known specimens to about a dozen.
Species.
Three species of "Campylognathoides" have been named:
The distinction between "C. liasicus" and "C. zitteli" is problematical. Plieninger merely recognised the smaller species because he considered its fossil too poor in quality to refer other specimens to. However, in 1925 Swedish researcher Carl Wiman, studying specimen UUPM R157, concluded that a fundamental morphological difference could distinguish the two species: "C. zitteli" has a proportionally much longer wing. In 2008 however, Padian pointed out that this might well have been a matter of ontogenetic development, larger individuals growing extra large wings to limit the wing load. Other differences, such as the larger number of teeth in the lower jaw, a longer snout and nares, five instead of four sacrals, perpendicular sacral ribs and a longer leg, might conceivably also be size-related. Final proof could only be given by a continuous growth series, as previously has been done in the case of "Rhamphorhynchus" and "Pterodactylus". Provisionally Padian kept distinguishing two species, but moved two specimens to "C. zitteli": SMNS 51100 and GPIT 24470, because of their larger size and morphological similarities.
Description.
Compared to its contemporary from the same layers "Dorygnathus", the snout on this genus is relatively short, though the skull is still in general elongated, be it much lighter built. The large eye sockets, placed low in the skull above a narrow jugal, have caused some researchers to speculate that "Campylognathoides" had especially acute vision, or possibly even a nocturnal lifestyle. The back of the skull is relatively high and flat, with a sudden downturn just in front of the eyes. The snout ends in a slender point curving a bit upwards at its very end. A large part of the snout is occupied by long bony nares. Below them a small triangular skull opening, the "fenestra antorbitalis" is present.
Reflecting the more shallow snout, the teeth of "Campylognathoides" are also short and not at all laniaries or fang-like as in the markedly heterodont "Dorygnathus". They are conical and recurved but have a broad base with the point bevelled off from the inside forming a sharp and strong cutting surface. In the upper jaw there are four rather widely spaced teeth in the praemaxilla gradually increasing in size from the front to the back; the fourth pair of teeth is the largest. Behind them are ten smaller teeth in the maxilla, gradually decreasing posteriorly. In the lower jaw there are twelve to fourteen teeth present in "C. liasicus", sixteen to nineteen in "C. zitteli". The largest total number is thus 66.
According to a study by Kevin Padian there are eight cervical vertebrae, fourteen dorsals, four or five sacrals and up to 38 caudal vertebrae. The tail base is flexible with about six short vertebrae; behind them the caudals elongate and are stiffened by very long extensions allowing the tail to function as a rudder.
The sternum of "Campylognathoides" was a rather large rectangular plate of bone with a short forward-facing crest called a cristospina. The upper arm is short but robust with a square deltopectoral crest. The lower arm too is short but wing length is considerable due to the hand, which has short metacarpals but a very long wing finger for a basal pterosaur, of which the second phalanx is the largest. The pteroid is short and robust.
The pelvis is not very well known. A fossil collector found a well preserved "Campylognathoides" hip in a Braunschweig shale quarry in 1986. This pelvis, BSP 1985 I 87, proved to be scientifically significant because the hip socket was according to Peter Wellnhofer in an upward lateral position, preventing the animal from being able to orient its legs erectly like in dinosaurs, birds and mammals. This would prove that "Campylognathoides" was not well able to walk on its hind legs but must have walked quadrupedally. This gait posture has been confirmed in other "rhamphorhynchoids" (i.e. basal pterosaurs) as well. However, Padian in 2009 concluded the opposite, stating that an erected position was necessary to place the feet on the ground and that, though a quadrupedal gait was possible, a bipedal way of locomotion was a precondition for a fast gait. This subject remains highly controversial.
The leg is rather short and the feet are small. The fifth toe, often interpreted as carrying a membrane between the legs, is exceptionally short for a basal pterosaur.
Classification.
Plieninger in his later publications assigned "Campylognathus" to the "Rhamphorhynchoidea". As this suborder is a paraphyletic assemblage of not specially related basal pterosaurs, this classification merely states the negative fact that it was not a pterodactyloid. A positive determination was first attempted by Baron Franz Nopcsa who in 1928 assigned the genus to the subfamily Rhamphorhynchinae within the family Rhamphorhynchidae. After a period in which very little work was done on pterosaur systematics, in 1967 Oskar Kuhn placed "Campylognathoides" in its own subfamily within the Rhamphorhynchidae, the Campylognathoidinae. However, in 1974 Peter Wellnhofer concluded that it was placed in a more basal position in the phylogenetic tree, below the Rhamphorhynchidae. In the early twenty-first century this was confirmed by the first extensive exact cladistic analyses. In 2003 both David Unwin and Alexander Kellner introduced a clade Campylognathoididae; within Unwin's terminology this clade is the sister clade of the Breviquartossa within the Lonchognatha; applying Kellner's terminology it is the most basal offshoot within the Novialoidea. There is no material difference between the two positions.
According to the analyses "Campylognathoides" would be closely related to "Eudimorphodon", to which it is similar in skull, sternum and humerus form. This was confirmed by Padian in 2009, though Padian also pointed out several basal features present in "Eudimorphodon" but lacking in "Campylognathoides". In 2010 an analysis was published by Brian Andres showing that "Eudimorphodon" together with "Austriadactylus" formed a very basal clade, leaving "Campylognathoides" as the only known member of the Campylognathoididae. Other recent phylogenetic analyses confirm these results, and suggest that "Campylognathoides" is more derived than all Triassic-aged pterosaurs, as well as the Early Jurassic "Dimorphodon" and "Parapsicephalus". "Campylognathoides" is the basalmost member of the Novialoidea which is defined as a node-based taxon consisting of the last common ancestor of "Campylognathoides", "Quetzalcoatlus" and all its descendants.
Paleobiology.
In the past, some paleontologists thought "Campylognathoides" had a piscivorous lifestyle, while other paleontologists have suggested an alternative interpretation that it might have been a predator of small terrestrial animals, or that it had a fast aerial lifestyle comparable to those of falcons and mastiff bats. Direct dietary evidence based on gut contents suggests that "Campylognathoides" fed on a belemnoid cephalopod "Clarkeiteuthis conocauda", indicating that it had a teuthophagous diet.

The Last Resort (1988 TV series)

The Last Resort was an Australian television drama series which originally screened by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The show premiered on 27 April 1988 and ended 13 December 1988 for a total of 30 weekly episodes of fifty minutes each. The series was created and co-written by Louis Nowra. The plot revolves around three adult sisters, Elizabeth Parker (Kate Fitzpatrick), Jennifer Shannon (Kris McQuade), and Louise Shannon (Nell Schofield), who attempt to live together and help in the management of the dilapidated seaside Hotel Isis. The series is set in Sydney's Bondi area and was "part of the initiative to increase the network's Australian drama output to 100 hours for [the year]." It featured original music by Martin Armiger.
Contemporary reviews from "The Canberra Times" in 1988 include David Vine's: "acclaimed almost universally as a disaster of epic proportions" and Jeannie Zakharov's: "the national broadcaster did not have much luck with bomb's like ... the aptly named "The Last Resort", which finally ground to a halt last week." More recent descriptions include "The Age"s Brenda Niall in 2004, who discussed Nowra's work "[it] ended badly ... [he] became aggressive and abusive. The series was a disaster." Also in 2004 Susan Lever of National Centre for Australian Studies, "thought [it was] fascinating and found its very mix of styles led to almost obligatory viewing during its run" and that, "Critical damnation, final though it seems, really is as transient as television broadcasting itself."
Production.
The series was created and written by Louis Nowra. It was produced by Jan Chapman and Wayne Barry with Bert Deling, Tim Gooding, Gabrielle Lord and Johanna Pigott as scriptwriters; it was directed by Geoffrey Nottage, Ron Elliott, Denny Lawrence, Colin Englert and Kate Woods. It was filmed at Langley Place Studios, the former GIO building, which "The Sydney Morning Herald"s Robin Oliver described as, "a building where the leaking roof is supported on a mass of internal columns – a nightmare for camera operators and set decorators – where the floor can be flooded in any decent rainstorm, where the ceiling is so low that the lighting can almost singe the hair of the actors, and where outside broadcast vans have had to be brought in."
Critical reception.
In a contemporary review, David Vine of "The Canberra Times" summarised, "If they handed out Golden Turkey awards for television in Australia, there is little doubt "The Last Resort" on the ABC would be up there with the best of them. Though acclaimed almost universally as a disaster of epic proportions. I heard it promoted, rather desperately, as a 'sensuous Australian drama'. There are many things "The Last Resort" is not - and sensuous is one of them." Nowra's memoir, "Shooting the Moon" (2004), was reviewed by Brenda Niall of "The Age", and she describes how, "His work on "The Last Resort" with ABC producer Jan Chapman and writer Tim Gooding ended badly. Using cocaine and alcohol to keep up the pace of writing a 30-episode series, Nowra became aggressive and abusive. The series was a disaster."
"The Canberra Times" Jeannie Zakharov reviewed ABC's shows for 1988 and concluded, "...the national broadcaster did not have much luck with bombs like the shortlived "Gerry Connelly Show"... and the aptly named "The Last Resort", which finally ground to a halt last week..." Susan Lever of National Centre for Australian Studies at Monash University discussed the works of Nowra and addressed the criticism of "The Last Resort", "I was one of the viewers who thought [it was] fascinating and found its very mix of styles led to almost obligatory viewing during its run. I remember with particular fondness the scene in which the mother was struck by lightning while playing lawn bowls – a wonderful parody of the way characters are disposed of in conventional soaps. [The series] goes down in the annals as a failure not only because it did not win audiences... but because it also attracted critical damnation... Critical damnation, final though it seems, really is as transient as television broadcasting itself."

Gesù Nuovo

Gesù Nuovo ("New Jesus") is the name of both a church and a square in Naples, Italy. It is located just beyond the western edge of the city's historic center. To the southeast of the spire, one can see, just a block away, the Fountain of Monteoliveto and the piazza in front of the church of Sant'Anna dei Lombardi.
The square emerged as part of Naples' westward expansion in the early 16th century, under the rule of the Spanish viceroy Pedro Álvarez de Toledo.
Three notable landmarks can be found in the Gesù Nuovo square:
Church of Gesù Nuovo.
History.
The Church of Gesù Nuovo was originally a palace built in 1470 for Roberto Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno. The Jesuits had already built a church with this name in Naples, now called "Gesú Vecchio". Political intrigues by the Sanseverino family caused the property to be confiscated, and eventually sold in the 1580s to the Jesuits for 45,000 ducats to construct a church (1584–1601) under architect Giuseppe Valeriano. The construction was also helped by local support including that of Roberta Carafa, Countess of Maddaloni. The adjacent gardens of Isabella Feltria, Principessa di Bisignano were also included in the construction. Construction of the church began in 1584. The new church retained the unusual facade, originally built for the palace, faced with rustic ashlar diamond projections.
When the Jesuits were expelled from Naples in 1767, the church passed to the Franciscan order. The Jesuits returned in 1821, only to be expelled again in 1848.
Art.
The vault frescos, representing biblical and saintly narratives that exalt the name of Jesus, were carried out by Belisario Corenzio and Paolo de Matteis. At the back of the facade is "The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple" (1725), a baroque masterpiece by Francesco Solimena. On the four pillars which support the dome are frescos of the four Evangelists, carried out by Giovanni Lanfranco. The inside of the dome had also been decorated by Lanfranco, but this was destroyed in the earthquake of 1688. Paolo de Matteis then repainted a new dome. The frescos of the life of the Virgin, placed on the second part of the vault up to the apse, are by Massimo Stanzione.
Surrounding the altar are three bronze bas-reliefs on a black marble base: on the left, "The Supper at Emmaus" (by Salvatore Irdi), on the right, "The Promise of the Eucharist at Capernau"m, and in the middle a reproduction of the "Last Supper" by Leonardo da Vinci. These last two bas-reliefs are by Gennaro Calì.
Above the altar, with didactic and historical symbols concerning the mystery of the Eucharist, are eight busts of saints who glorified the Eucharist. From left to right are medallions of Saints Juliana of Liège, Stanislaus Kostka, Thomas Aquinas, Francis Borgia, Gaetano Thiene, and the blessed Lanfranc of Canterbury. Gennaro Calì completed four medallions; the third and the fourth busts are by Costantino Labarbera.
Chapel of the Visitation.
The chapel of the Visitation has an altar-piece by Massimo Stanzione. Under the altar there is a bronze urn containing the mortal remains of St. Joseph Moscati (1880–1927), a biochemistry teacher at the University of Naples and head physician of the Ospedale degli Incurabili, canonized on 25 October 1987 by Pope John Paul II. His medical activities are shown in the triptych sculptured on the urn by Amedeo Garufi. The left panel shows the professor with his students, the middle the saint enlightened by the Eucharist, the right one the doctor, giving comfort to suffering and sick people at the Hospital. In 1990, a bronze statue of the saint, by Pier Luigi Sopelsa, was erected to the left of the altar.
Chapel of Saint Francis Xavier.
In the chapel of Saint Francis Xavier, the altar-piece shows Saint Francis Xavier receiving a vision of the Virgin Mary, attributed to Giovanni Bernardino Azzolino. On the upper part, three paintings on the wall by Luca Giordano and the vault frescos by Corenzio and De Matteis represent episodes from the saint's life.
Chapel of St. Francis Borgia.
The canvas placed in the chapel of St. Francis Borgia (1510–1572) is attributed to Sebastiano Conca.
Sacred Heart Chapel.
At the end of the right aisle, there is the Sacred Heart chapel, once dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The frescos on the side walls were carried out by Belisario Corenzio. The picture representing the holy Trinity with Groups of Saints, whose author is Guercino, is now placed on one side of the chapel of St. Ignatius.
The altar-piece displays the "Virgin with Child Jesus and 3 Saint Martyrs", attributed to Giovanni Bernardino Azzolino (1560–1610).
Nativity Chapel.
This has an altarpiece by Girolamo Imparato.
Chapel of St Ignatius of Loyola.
In this chapel are two statues of "David" and "Jeremiah" by Cosimo Fanzago. He also helped complete the decoration of the chapel, rebuilt after the 1688 earthquake. On the upper part, paintings by Ribera portray episodes in the life of the Saint: when he received the rules of the order from the Virgin, when he received approval of the order from Pope Paul II, and a glorification of the Saint. The vault frescos, with "episodes from St. Ignatius’s life" by De Matteis. The Prince of Venosa, Carlo Gesualdo, who was a famous composer and infamous murderer of his wife and her lover, is buried in front of the St. Ignatius Chapel.
Chapel of the Crucifix.
The chapel has a wooden statue of "Christ crucified, with the Blessed Virgin and St. John", sculpted by Francesco Mollica, a pupil of Michelangelo Naccherino. The "Angels holding Veronica's Veil" were painted b the school of Vaccaro. The ceiling frescos with the "Story of Christ" were painted by Giovanni Battista Benaschi, and retouched by Petronsio. Benaschi also painted the triangular lunettes on the altar.
The two imposing side Reliquaries, with 70 busts of saint martyrs in golden wood, were made in the most part in 1617 by the Neapolitan woodcarver Giovan Battista Gallone.
The Sacristy contains frescos by Aniello Falcone. The Lavabo, at the back, is a work in polychrome marbles made by Dionisio Lazzari.
The Church of Santa Chiara.
The Church of Santa Chiara is a Gothic style church-convent built between 1310 and 1328 for the wife of Robert, King of Naples. It has a belfry that stands within the grounds at the northeast corner. The complex retains the citadel-like walls setting it apart from the outside world. The walls contained a vast religious community, and today contain the more modest convent of the Poor Clares and a community of the Grey Friars. The complex was expanded along Baroque architecture lines in the 18th century. It was almost entirely destroyed by bombing in WW II and was restored to its original Gothic form in 1953. The noteworthy monastic courtyard at the rear of the church is the result of renovation carried out by Domenico Antonio Vaccaro in the 1730s, for Maria Amalia of Saxony, wife of Charles III of Bourbon, King of Naples. The majolica tilework is characteristic of the school of Neapolitan ceramic from that period and was crafted by Donato Massa and his son, Giuseppe.
Spire or "Guglia" of the Immaculate Virgin.
The "Guglia dell'Immacolata" is a monument that stands in the square in front of the church of Gesù Nuovo. It is the tallest and most ornamental of three such "plague columns" in Naples. Putatively, it was built to invoke the Virgin Mary's protection from the plague. Begun in the 17th century, it was completed only in 1750 after decades of pauses in construction. Sculptors Francesco Pagani and Matteo Bottiglieri worked on the rich Baroque decoration, prototypic of Neapolitan Baroque. It contains bas-relief depictions of the "Presentation of Jesus at the Temple", the "Birth of the Virgin Mary" and the "Annunciation".

<doc id="7001309" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7001309" title="Mnozil Brass">
Mnozil Brass

Mnozil Brass is an Austrian brass septet. They play classical, jazz and other styles of music using traditional brass instruments and more unusual instruments such as the customized rotary valved trumpet and bass trumpet. Music is presented with a typical Austrian style of humour, which can be approximately characterized as "jet black" and "here and there" absurd. Elements of slapstick exist next to virtuosic brass playing. They are often popularly referred to as "The Monty Python of the musical world". Austrian and German schlager songs of the 20th century are often caricatured.
History.
All the founding members are graduates of the renowned Vienna College of Music, who met while playing at the Mnozil pub in Vienna's first inner-city district. The band was founded in 1992 although its first official outing was in 1993.
Former member Sebastian Fuchsberger was a great talent in imitating, for example, Johannes Heesters and Udo Jürgens. Mnozil Brass is able to convince the audience that playing music is not just serious business.
The septet cooperates with freelance director Bernd Jeschek who developed the stage programs "Smoke", "Ragazzi" and "Seven" and the "first operetta of the 21st century" titled "Das Trojanische Boot" ("The Trojan Boat"), whose world premiere was in 2005 during the German art festival RuhrTriennale.
The group has toured internationally and won praise from artists such as Barry Tuckwell, Chuck Findley, Jeff Nelson and Wycliffe Gordon.
Repertoire from Seven Show.
Mnozil has a wide repertoire. Their two-hour-long concerts feature the group playing all manners of music, always without sheet music, along with comedic antics and sketchlike parts. While the majority of items feature the band playing their brass instruments, they incorporate other instruments such as the recorder, as well as singing ("Bohemian Rhapsody" being a key example).
Genres include Austrian drinking and folk songs, jazz, pop, rearrangements of classical pieces, movie soundtracks and schlager.

Equestrian statue of Charles IV of Spain

The equestrian statue of Charles IV of Spain (also known as "El Caballito") is a bronze sculpture cast by Manuel Tolsá built between 1796 and 1803 in Mexico City, Mexico in honour of King Charles IV of Spain, then the last ruler of the New Spain (later Mexico). This statue has been displayed in different points of the city and is considered one of the finest achievements of Mr. Tolsá. It now resides in Plaza Manuel Tolsá.
History.
The project was initiated by Miguel de la Grúa Talamanca, Marquis of Branciforte, who was Viceroy of the New Spain. Once he obtained permission for the monument, he appointed people to perform the work and construction began. To that end, he emptied the main plaza (the Plaza de la Constitución, or “Zocalo”) and erected an elliptical railing with four access gates.
The pedestal for the statue was inaugurated with large and well-attended parties and bullfights on 8 December 1796. A temporary statue, constructed out of wood and gilded stucco, was placed on top of the pedestal; it also represented the Spanish monarch.
The Equestrian Statue of Charles IV was melted and cast in one operation under the supervision of Tolsá, who was director of the Academy of San Carlos. The statue required between 450 and 600 quintales of bronze (one quintal being equivalent to 46 kg), and was cast in the area near the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul. The sculptor modeled the frame after a horse owned by the Marquis of Jaral of Berrio named "Tambor" (or "drum"). After being polished and engraved, the statue was taken to its pedestal and inaugurated on 9 December 1803. The celebrations and bullfights were repeated, with great jubilation. The Baron Alexander von Humboldt was present at the unveiling. In his opinion, and for this genre, the statue produced by Tolsá is second only to the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, in Rome.
In 1821, due to anti-Hispanic sentiment manifesting during the Mexican independence, and due to a desire to replace the monument, the statue was covered in a blue tent. It was not long before people considered destroying the monument, to melt it down to reuse the bronze for guns or coins. Aggravating matters, underneath one of the hooves of the statue one will find the mark of an Aztec quiver, perhaps a sign of allegiance to Spain.
The statue was saved by Lucas Alamán, who convinced Guadalupe Victoria to retain the statue on the merit of its aesthetic qualities. This resulted in the statue being relocated in 1822 to the courtyard of the ancient university, to prevent people from destroying it. It wasn't until 1824 that the public was permitted to access the statue, but the statue was much safer in this location. In 1852, after years had passed and tempers had calmed, the statue was moved to the intersection Paseo de la Reforma and Avenida Bucareli, although this time it was protected from potential damage by a grille. In 1979 it was relocated to its current location, Plaza Manuel Tolsá, overlooking the Palacio de Minería. Currently, in response to the earlier controversy surrounding the statue, the plaque on the pedestal indicates that Mexico conserved the statue as a monument to art, and not as a sign of praise to a Spanish king. A smaller, slightly different version of the sculpture can be seen in the Tolsá museum opposite the statue.
The statue weighs 26 tonnes and is the second largest cast bronze statue in the world.

Culture of Thiruvananthapuram

The city of Thiruvananthapuram has been the centre of cultural activities of Kerala (India) from the time it was made capital of Travancore in 1745. The capital city is a major intellectual and artistic center. The Thiruvananthapuram Museum and Thiruvananthapuram Zoo were started during the reign of Swathi Thirunal (1813–1847) and are one of the oldest of their kind in India. The city's libraries include the Thiruvananthapuram Public library, which was started in 1829. The Swathi Thirunal College of Music and 'College of fine arts' are the leading institutions related to music and arts.
Literature.
Many great poets and men of letters from ancient times belonged to Thiruvananthapuram. One such poet was Ayyipillai Asan (15th or 16th Century AD) of Avaaduthura near Kovalam. He wrote his work "Ramakadhapattu", which represents a stage in the evolution of the southern dialect of Malayalam. Two most outstanding poets patronized by the royal family of Travancore were Unnayi Variyar and Kunchan Nambiar. The reign of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal (1813–1846), the royal composer, saw the golden age of Carnatic music in Kerala. The contribution of Swathi Thirunal in the realm of music has enriched even the cultural heritage of India. Irayimman Thampi (1782–1856), a contemporary of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal, was another composer of great originality and deep learning. Vidwan Raja Raja Varma Koithampuran was also a scholar and poet who belonged to this period.
Thiruvananthapuram witnessed a cultural renaissance in twentieth century. Kerala Varma Valiakoi Thampuran (1845–1914), who spent a major part of his life in Thiruvananthapuram, translated Kalidasa's Abhijñānaśākuntalam into Malayalam which won him the title of " Kerala Kalidasa ". He is also regarded as the father of modern Malayalam prose.
The contributions of A. R. Raja Raja Varma (1863–1918), known as "Kerala Panini", marked an important stage in the development of Malayalam literature. Another notable writer is C. V. Raman Pillai (1858–1922), who was a novelist par excellence. Mahakavi Kumaran Asan (1873–1924) and Mahakavi Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer (1877–1949) were the two outstanding poets from Thiruvananthapuram. Kumaran Asan was the true representative of the cultural renaissance. Ulloor was not only a poet, but also a scholar, researcher and historian.
Shabdatharavali, the comprehensive dictionary in Malayalam was written by Sreekanteswaram Padmanabha Pillai who hailed from here. The two all-time great social reformers in Kerala Narayana Guru and Chattampi Swamikal also were born here. They contributed much to the Malayalam literature through their books.
Thiruvananthapuram hosts the literary festival known as Kovalam Literary Festival. Started from 2008, this literary festival is held every year on October. Although the event aims in boosting the literature and arts it has an eye on the tourism prospectus of the state.

Goethe Zentrum - Thiruvananthapuram's relation with Germany goes back to Basel missionary Hermann Gundert, who in a pivotal meeting with the Travancore Maharajah decided to stay back in Kerala. He wrote the first formal dictionary of sorts of Malayalam thus playing a pivotal role in the state's education and language.

Contributions of Thiruvananthapuram to painting are immense. The earliest of murals that can be attributed to the Kerala tradition are found in a small cave-shrine at Thirunandikkara in south Travancore, now a part of Tamil Nadu.

Siva, Parvathi and Ganapathi are among the figures represented. Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple at Thiruvananthapuram has several murals, which belongs to the 18th century. The paintings at Koikal Temple at Attingal bear close resemblance to those in the Padmanabha Swami Temple, which are examples of 16th century Kerala
paintings. 
Raja Ravi Varma (1848–1905), an illustrious painter of the district, stands at the cross-roads of Indian art history. Ravi Varma's contribution to Indian painting is substantial and singular. He is officially regarded as "a prince among painters and painter among princes" by the Kerala government. Some of the most paintings of Raja Ravi Varma are preserved in the Sri Chitra Art Gallery.

Valet boy

Valet boy () is a term used in some countries to refer to young people who ask for fees from those who park at the roadside. Valet boys usually work in groups, and demand an RM 1-5 "parking fee" from car owners, under an agreement that they will protect the car. If the driver refuses to pay, the valet boys will vandalise the vehicle. This "protection" service is thus a form of extortion. The valet boys do not park the cars for the owners, but direct the owners into parking lots. 
This practice has become common in large Brazilian cities, such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, where numerous cases of "valet boys" vandalizing cars are reported every day. Similar schemes are also run in other countries, although the person is not necessarily a boy. In the Philippines, however, this scheme is mostly run by street children.
In Indonesia, this practice is so commonplace and generally accepted that a local government may hire a mob to collect the parking fee, which is usually shared between them.

The DG834 series are popular ADSL modem router products from Netgear. The devices can be directly connected to a phone line and establish an ADSL broadband Internet connection to an internet service provider (ISP) and share it among several computers via 802.3 Ethernet and (on many models) 802.11b/g wireless data links.
These devices are popular among ISPs as they provide an all in one solution (ADSL modem/router/firewall/switch), which is ideal for home broadband users. The Netgear UK website claims the DG834G is the most popular wireless router in the UK and lists five awards that it has received.
The DG834G is perhaps the most popular product of the series, and has been produced in five versions. All versions have Wi-Fi.
The DG834 (without the G suffix) is the same product but without Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi can be added later by plugging in a wireless access point although this then occupies one of the RJ45 ports.
The DG834GT is a similar product - it looks like a DG834G v2 or v3, but has a Broadcom chipset like a DG834G v4 and supports Atheros Super G which can achieve a 108 Mbit/s signaling rate (double that of standard 802.11g). In the United Kingdom, many DG834GT routers were supplied by Sky Broadband and are branded with a Sky logo. Sky later supplied a DG934G router, which is a DG834G v3 router in a black case.
The DG834 GB is similar to DG834GT, have Broadcom chipset, but support only 54 Mbit/s wifi. It has modifications to support Annex-B ADSL.
The DG834PN model has Wi-Fi but no external antenna. It has six internal antennas, and is easily recognised by the blue dome on the top of its case.
The DG834GSP model is locked to a particular ISP.
Firmware.
Netgear's stock firmware on all products in the series runs Linux. This has led to popularity among computer enthusiasts as it provides a cheaper alternative to a Linux router. Much of the Netgear firmware is built from open-source software, and Netgear provide this source code and the build system to enable users to reassemble a new firmware image. As a result, various individuals and projects have produced modified firmware which extend the capabilities of the built-in firmware. It is also possible to completely replace the built-in firmware for TI-AR7 and Broadcom chipsets with firmware from other projects, such as OpenWRT. All products except the DG834(G) v5 run on a MIPS architecture CPU, the DG834(G) v5 runs on an ARM architecture CPU.
Security issue.
Any person who can access the router using a web browser, can enable "debug" mode using and then connect via Telnet directly to the router's embedded Linux system as 'root', which gives unfettered access to the router's operating system via its Busybox functionality. Additionally, a 'hidden' URL also allows unfettered access (On a v5 model a username and password are requested). There is no user option provided to disable this. On default Netgear firmware Telnet access lacks password or other control; on ISP modified versions (such as Sky) a Telnet password exists based on the MAC address which can be found via online websites.
Differences between revisions/versions.
DG834GT.
Only one version produced. White case with a white removable antenna to the rear left of the unit which utilises an RP-SMA connector. Inclusion of a Broadcom BCM6348 chipset make this model notable, particularly as the Broadcom chipset offers superior compatibility over the Texas Instruments AR7 chipset (used in the DG834G v1-3) with ADSL2+ / LLU lines in the UK, partly due to power spectrum density (PSD) masks applied at the DSLAM.

Charles Lawrence (cricketer)

Charles Lawrence (16 December 1828 – 20 December 1916) was an English cricketer, who played for Scotland, Ireland, Surrey and England. 
After the touring with the England side of 1861–62, he settled in Australia, where he became captain-coach for New South Wales, and then captain-coach of the Aboriginal cricket team that toured England in 1868, the first ever tour of England by an Australian team.
Career.
British Isles.
At the age of 17 Lawrence was engaged by the Perth Cricket Club in Scotland. In 1849 he played against the All English XI on tour in Scotland and he took all the English wickets for 24 runs. While in Scotland he also played for the Caledonian Cricket Club of Glasgow.
In 1851 Lawrence played for the Phoenix Cricket Club in Dublin, and in 1856 he formed and captained the United All Ireland XI, where he became friends with Tom Wills who played for that team. He played for Surrey between 1854 and 1857. He was selected for England to take part in one of the first international cricket tours, when the first All England XI, captained by H. H. Stephenson, toured Australia in 1861–62. The team travelled on the SS "Great Britain". The players in this team were professionals, with each player paid £150 and guaranteed first class travelling expenses by the sponsors, Melbourne-based businessmen Spiers and Pond.
Australia.
After the 1861–62 tour, Lawrence settled in Australia and was appointed Australia's first professional cricket coach for the Albert Cricket Club in Redfern, Sydney, to raise the standard of cricket in the state. Appointed captain of NSW, Lawrence took a match-winning 14 for 73 against Victoria in his first game, still a record. He played five times for New South Wales cricket team, and in 1863-64 took 4 for 42 and 6 for 48 for New South Wales against an England XI. Four of Australia’s first 15 Test cricketers would later have Albert CC pedigrees.
The 1868 Aboriginal XI.
Lawrence first saw the indigenous team under the instruction of Tom Wills playing a match at the Albert Ground. On this occasion there was some contract disagreement between the failed sponsor Gurnett and Wills, and the players were left in Sydney. Lawrence was instructed to look after the Aboriginal players. At this time Lawrence was a publican and billeted the players in his hotel in Manly until he could arrange some cricket matches to raise money to return the players to the Western District of Victoria.
In 1868 Lawrence was contracted to coach and captain Australia's 'First Eleven' that toured England. He trained the players for two months at "Lake Wallace" in Edenhope in the Western District before selecting a side to tour England. The tour was financed by Sydney Lawyer George Graham along with his cousin George Smith (who had been Mayor of Sydney in 1859) and William Hayman; they all travelled to England for the tour.
After arriving in England, the Aboriginal XI proceeded to play 47 matches against county and local teams, between May and October 1868, including a match at Lord's. The Australian team won 14, drew 19 and lost 14 of their matches.
Subsequently.
On his return to Sydney, the tour having lost £2,000, Lawrence sold the hotel, which fell into disrepair for some time, and moved up the coast to Newcastle where he worked for 24 years as an official for NSW Railways. Here, aged 55, he played for XVIII of Newcastle v Ivo Bligh's 1882/83 tourists.
Lawrence coached the juniors of the Melbourne Cricket Club from 1891 for eight years.
Family life.
When Lawrence sailed for Australia with Stephenson, he and his wife Anne had a son and two daughters, all Dublin-born. The family joined him in Australia, but his wife Anne died at their hotel in November 1866. Five days later, their Sydney-born daughter also died. His eldest daughter Anne may have accompanied the team to England in 1868, as she is recorded as being with them on the return voyage. In 1871, he married again, to Yorkshire-born Emmaretta Denison. They had three daughters, two of whom died in infancy. Emmaretta was to die before her husband, in hospital, in December 1915.
Lawrence died in December 1916. His death notice reads "The Father of Australian Cricket tours".

Forum (shopping centre)

Forum is a shopping centre in Helsinki, Finland, opened in 1985 and located between the streets of Mannerheimintie, Simonkatu, Yrjönkatu and Kalevankatu.
The original Forum building is located in the corner of Mannerheimintie and Simonkatu. The shopping centre has been constantly expanded to also fill other buildings in the city block.
The shopping centre includes an underground parking lot, with connections to the nearby surroundings, including to Stockmann.
As well as numerous businesses, the Forum city block includes the privately owned Amos Anderson art museum and the Forum medical and dental health centre.
Forum is the only privately owned shopping centre in the Finnish capital area. Bilinguality is emphasised in the shopping centre, because it is owned by Finland-Swedish organisations, most notably Föreningen Konstsamfundet, which was founded in 1940 by Amos Anderson. The organisation supports Finland-Swedish culture and publications, and deals out grants, which amount up to 3 million euro per year. This is financed by the rent from the Forum shopping centre building.

Coach (basketball)

Basketball coaching is the act of directing and strategizing the behavior of a basketball team or individual basketball player. Basketball coaching typically encompasses the improvement of individual and team offensive and defensive skills, as well as overall physical conditioning. Coaches also have the responsibility to improve their team by player development, strategy, and in-game management. Coaches also teach and inspire their team to be their best.
Coaching is usually performed by a single person, often with the help of one or more assistants.
Coaching tools.
A dry erase clipboard or tablet computer with a basketball court outline is often used mid-game to describe plays and provide an overview of the strategy of the opposing team. Coaches strategize and scout opposing teams and find ways to defeat them as easily as possible. At the same time, they overlook their own personal team to start the best five players (only five players can be on floor at one time). Coaches, also, have to be aware of substitutes to put in throughout the game so they can be fresh.
A drill designer is used to sketch drills, plays and information. Coaches also utilise file managers to store all coaching materials in one place and access from anywhere. Planners are also used to blueprint strategies and game plans.
College basketball coach John Wooden would spend two hours each morning with assistants planning out a day's practice minute-by-minute on three-by-five cards. He kept each card year over year to adjust and improve. He would train his players with "mental and emotional" conditioning by always making practice more intense than the game. Players would run faster than what a game would require so that they could be prepared to dominate in the game.
Coaching strategy.
A coach's job is to draw up plays and implement systems for the offense and defense. These strategies can mean the difference between winning and losing a game. An offensive coach that is playing against a zone defense needs to create a play for his team to score. Kimble explains that a coach must have a fundamental set that is the base for every play against a zone, because each zone defense is so different (Kimble, 30).
Offensive strategy.
Against a man to man defense.
A coach needs to have a basic play to call against a zone defense and a man to man defense. With a man defense, a coach has an offense that is continuous. A popular offensive schematic is called the flex offense. In the flex offense, we have two guards on the wings, two post on the blocks, and a shooting guard in the corner. The point guard drives the ball to the wing on the side that has the shooting guard. He then swings the ball to the guard on the offside wing and the shooting guard runs his flex cut, past the screen given by the post on the block. The other post pops out to the corner and, ideally, the shooting guard is open in the key and gets an easy layup. If not, the point guard screens down to the post, the post pops up and gets the pass and we are now in position for the other corner to flex cut again. This offense can run continuously until there is a score or a turnover. This offense only works if the coach can teach his players how to cut and screen effectively. 4
Against a zone defense.
When playing against a zone, the idea is to spread the defense thin and then exploit the soft spots in the middle of the zone and when it shifts, use the shooters on the outside. The general layout for any zone offense is a point guard at the top, two shooting guards on the wings, and two posts down low. When the point guard passes to the left, the left post drops to the short corner between the block and the baseline in that soft spot. The other post comes up to the freethrow line extended and makes himself big at the high post. Coaches teach a tactic called inside out. This means that the goal is to feed the ball from the wing into one of the posts. If the high post gets the ball, he faces the basket and has a ton of options. He can drive and score, shoot the ball, feed the low post that cuts to the basket, feed the offside shooting guard that cuts backdoor, or kick it back out to the guard that gave him the ball so he can shoot or drive. The goal is to find the open man, because each time a pass is made, the defense has to shift. The coach must teach the players to look up, run the play, and find the soft spots in the zone with and without the ball. This play base only works if players find open lanes and the players with the ball find the open man. Quick passes cause more shift in the defense.
Defensive strategy.
No matter what type of defense that is drawn up by a coach, the players must be taught some basic fundamentals. Some important ones are how to get over a screen, how to box out and rebound, and how to close out a shooter. To do this, a coach must teach positioning over all else so that the rest of these skills come easier. Players need to be aggressive. This throws off the offense so they don't pass as well, they rush shots, and forget their fundamentals. A coach needs to teach two things to all his players so they can be confident in taking risks and playing this aggressive style.
Especially guards need to be taught to overplay the passing lanes. This means that they anticipate the pass and jump into the lane when the ball is thrown. This gets steals and scares the offensive guards. The problem is that if your defense does this too often, it leaves the rest of your players vulnerable to an attack when a pass is faked, and the offensive guard cuts back door. This leaves your guard out of position, however, this doesn't have to be a bad thing if you teach your players the second fundamental.
Players must be taught helpside defense. This is a system that must be used no matter what defense you run as a coach. The premise is that the player guarding the ball is right on him, the players guarding someone that is one pass away from the ball, need to play close to them or denying a pass. The other players that are guarding guys that are further from the ball need to sag into the middle to help their teammates. If a defensive player jumps a passing lane, or someone gets beat off the dribble, there must be players that sag off their man to help stop the ball. Once this happens, the defensive player that got beat is responsible to recover and get down to switch with their helpside player. Teaching helpside defense gives a coach's defensive players the confidence to play aggressive defense because they know there is help behind them if they need it.

Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)

"Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)" is a doo-wop style novelty song from 1961 by the American songwriter Barry Mann, who wrote it with Gerry Goffin. It was originally released as a single on the ABC-Paramount label (10237).
Lyrics.
In this song, Mann sings about the frequent use of nonsense lyrics in doo-wop music, and how his girl fell in love with him after listening to several such songs.
Examples of the type of song referred to include The Marcels' version of "Blue Moon" (in which they sing "Bomp bomp ba bomp, ba bomp ba bomp bomp" and "dip-de-dip-de-dip") and The Edsels' "Rama-Lama-Ding-Dong", both of which charted earlier the same year. The spoken section is a reference to the song "Little Darlin'" by the Diamonds. "Boogidy shoo" can be found in the lyrics to "Pony Time" by Chubby Checker, released earlier that year. Mann was backed up by the Halos, a doo-wop group of its own renown that had a single top-40 hit with "Nag" and also sang on Curtis Lee's hit "Pretty Little Angel Eyes."
"Who Put the Bomp" is an example of a song about the genre it belongs to, in this case doo-wop. This is accentuated by the fact that Mann is a songwriter singing about songwriters.
Chart performance.
The single debuted on "Billboard"'s Hot 100 on August 7, 1961, and remained for twelve weeks, peaking at #7. In Canada the song was #1 for 3 weeks, starting August 14, 1961. Mann's version did not chart in the UK, though a cover version by the Viscounts reached #21 there in September 1961. The Viscounts' record was in turn covered by comedians Morecambe and Wise, with the same melody and modified lyrics ("We put the Bomp in the..."); the record was titled "We're the Guys (Who Drive Your Baby Wild)".
A newer version, by Showaddywaddy, charted at #37 in August 1982.

Banoo Jehangir Coyaji

Banoo Jehangir Coyaji (7 September 1917 – 15 July 2004) was an Indian physician and activist in family planning and population control. She was director of King Edward Memorial Hospital in Pune, and started programmes of community health workers in rural areas of Maharashtra, the third largest state in India. She became an advisor to the union government and an internationally recognised expert.
Biography.
Early life.
Banoo Pestonji Kapadia was born in Mumbai on 7 September 1917 into a Parsi family. Her father was a well known civil engineer by the name of Pestonji Kapadia. At a young age, Banoo was sent to live with her grandparents in Pune where she experienced a life of wealth and luxury. Her parents' constant visits and her close relationship with her grandparents led her to live a self-proclaimed fulfilled childhood.
Education.
While living with her grandparents, Banoo became the first girl to matriculate from St. Vincent's, an all boys school, and attended the Convent of Jesus and Mary where she often placed first in rankings. After her schooling at the Convent, Banoo took the Senior Cambridge and passed with distinction in five classes. She went on to do pre-medical sources at St. Xaviers College and then studied medicine at Grant Medical College where she graduated with an M.D. degree in 1940. Banoo trained to become a gynecologist during her residency with the renowned Dr. V.N. Shirodkar but pursued general practice under Dr. Edulji Coyaji when she returned to Pune in 1943.
Marriage.
When Banoo visited Mahabaleshwar in 1937, she was introduced to her future husband Jehangir Coyaji by Edulji Coyaji, Banoo's mentor and Jehangir's brother. Jehangir was an engineer by trade and had recently completed his degree at Purdue University. Banoo and Jehangir were married on 24 February 1941, five years after they began their courtship. On 7 August 1942, the couple had their first child, a boy by the name of Kurus. In 1943, they went on to build a house in Pune and settled there.
Professional life.
In April 1944, Sardar Moodliar requested Dr. Edulji Coyaji to recommend a highly trained doctor capable of taking over the King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEM), a small maternal care hospital located in Pune. Dr. Edulji Coyaji suggested Dr. Banoo Jehangir Coyaji for the job and six months later, she assumed the position of Chief Medical Officer. In her 55 years in this role, Banoo grew the hospital from 40 beds in 1944 to 550 beds in 1999. She also transformed KEM into a teaching hospital and research institute and established an affiliation with B. J. Medical College.
Banoo also developed a primary health center in Vadu in 1972 that eventually grew into a hospital catering nearby rural areas. In 1977, she created a program directed towards improving rural community healthcare. She trained approximately 600 girls in matters of hygiene, family planning, and nutrition so they could assist their communities. Over time, Banoo's model was adopted in locations across the country. Furthermore, Banoo realized the lack of education and workforce skills in many young women and mothers. As a response to this crisis, she founded the Young Women's Health and Development Project in 1988. This project was aimed at teaching young women necessary skills such as reading and embroidery, and supplementing these skills with conversations about caste and gender roles.
Banoo was a member of the Scientific and Technical Group in Human Reproduction, WHO, Women's Health and Development, and Health, Manpower and Development at WHO. She was a Consultant to the Government of Maharashtra, the Government of India, the World Bank, Ford Foundation, UNFPA and many other bodies of national and international importance. She was also a member of the Management Council as well as Professor Emeritus, Pune University. Her major contribution has been in the areas of family planning, urban and rural health and children's health.
Interests.
Banoo had a persistent interest in literature that was passed on to her from her father. She pursued this interest through her involvement in the Sakal Group of Newspapers as its director for 30 years. In addition to this, she obtained honorary degrees in literature in 1994 from the University of Pune and SNDT University.
She also learned Western classical music during her time at the Convent of Jesus and Mary and enjoyed playing piano at her grandparents' house. Banoo performed for examiners from London's Trinity College of Music.
In addition to literature and music, Banoo enjoyed attending parties and ballroom dancing with her husband, Jehangir.

Mater Infirmorum Hospital

The Mater Infirmorum Hospital, commonly known as The Mater, is an acute hospital in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It provides services to most of North Belfast and South Antrim, reaching as far as Glengormley, Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey It is managed by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust.
History.
The Mater Infirmorum ("Mother of the Sick") Hospital has been serving the people of Belfast since it admitted its first patients in premises on the Crumlin Road in Belfast, known as Bedeque House, on 1 November 1883. It was initially founded by the Sisters of Mercy but has always treated patients without regard to class or creed. Between 1841 and 1891, the population of Belfast dramatically increased from 75,308 to 255,922. In 1895, Dr Patrick MacAlister, the Bishop of Down and Connor, arranged for expansion of the Mater Infirmorum Hospital with construction of a new building on Mountview Terrace.
The main hospital, which was designed by William Fennell, was officially opened by Sir Robert McConnell, Lord Mayor of Belfast, on 22 April 1900. The hospital was officially recognised as a university teaching hospital for university students of Queen's University in 1908.
In June 1922, the hospital was subjected to an armed attack: the hospital management wrote to King George V, David Lloyd George, Winston Churchill and Michael Collins seeking protection and the incident did not happen again. A landmine exploded outside the hospital leading to numerous casualties in April 1941 during the Belfast Blitz of the Second World War. A new maternity wing opened in 1945.
Much of the fund raising for modernisation of the hospital in the 1950s was carried out by the Young Philanthropists Association. This included the first neuro-psychiatry department which opened in 1952. It was the first hospital in Northern Ireland to treat injured soldiers from the British Army in October 1969 and became fully integrated into the National Health Service in 1972. A new block, incorporating a new accident and emergency unit, a new out-patients department, a new radiology department, an operating theatre suite and a 35-bed maternity unit, opened at the hospital in 1989.
During the COVID-19 pandemic the Mater became Belfast's dedicated hospital for COVID-19 patients.

Giant white-tailed rat

The giant white-tailed rat (Uromys caudimaculatus) is an Australian rodent native to tropical rainforest of north Queensland, with subspecies occurring in New Guinea and the Aru Islands. It is one of the largest rodents in Australia, reaching up to 1 kg in weight. It is grey-brown above, cream to white below, and has a long, naked tail of which the distal section is white (Moore 1995).
Breeding commences in September or October, peaking in December and January at the height of the wet season. After a gestation of 36 days, a litter of two to three (rarely four) young are born, and remain with the mother for approximately three months (Moore 1995).
Common names.
The common name of this species has long been white-tailed rat or giant white-tailed rat. During the 1990s there was a push for such descriptive English common names to be replaced with indigenous Australian names, and accordingly, in 1995 the Australian Nature Conservation Agency published recommendations for the common names of rodents. They compiled six indigenous names for this species: the Yidiny name "Durrgim"; the Jaabugay name "Durrkin"; the Gnog names "Jikoy", "Koojang" and "Parrongkai"; and the Kuuku Ya'u name "Thupi". Despite this they recommended the adoption of the name Mati, which is a general name for rats and mice recorded from the vicinity of the Peach River on Cape York. However this recommendation was not prescriptive, and it remains to be seen to what extent it will be adopted.
It is known as kabkal in the Kalam language of Papua New Guinea.

King's College Criteria

The King's College Criteria or the King's College Hospital criteria were devised in 1989 to determine if there were any early indices of poor prognosis in patients with acute liver failure. Acute liver failure is defined as the onset of encephalopathy (altered mental status) or coagulopathy (altered bleeding tendencies) within 26 weeks of a patient diagnosed with liver disease. Patients with hepatitis B acquired at birth, Wilson's disease and autoimmune hepatitis are included if their disease was identified within the past 26 weeks. These patients are very ill, and have a very high risk of dying of their illness without adequate treatment which may include liver transplantation. It is important that physicians find ways of identifying patients with acute liver failure early in their course who will do poorly, and may require liver transplantation. The King's College Criteria have consistently shown excellent operating characteristics for determining prognosis in these patients. As liver transplantation becomes a more accessible option for patients with acute liver failure, the King's College Criteria serve a role in determining which patients may require transplantation.
Criteria.
The King's College criteria were described in a seminal publication in 1989 by J.G. O'Grady and colleagues from King's College School of Medicine. 588 patients with acute liver failure who presented to King's College Hospital from 1973 to 1985 were assessed retrospectively to determine if there were particular clinical features or tests that correlated poorly with prognosis. The criteria were stratified into acetaminophen and non-acetaminophen causes of acute liver failure, due to the different operating characteristics of parameters correlating with prognosis in the two causes.
Paracetamol induced acute liver failure.
Acetaminophen (or paracetamol) is an analgesic medication that can affect the liver when administered in high doses. Acetaminophen is predominantly conjugated into glucuronate and sulfate moieties by Phase II metabolism. A small percentage is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 pathway to a toxic metabolite, NAPQI. NAPQI is conjugated by glutathione to non-toxic cysteine and mercapturic acid moieties. In cases of acetaminophen toxicity, the Phase II conjugation enzymes are saturated, and a higher fraction is converted to NAPQI. The conjugation of NAPQI to glutathione occurs until glutathione is depleted from hepatic reserves, after which the toxic NAPQI accumulates and causes damage to the hepatocytes. This occurs primarily in areas of the liver that are relatively poorly perfused with oxygen, or furthest away from the hepatic artery, termed "Zone 3". Acetaminophen overdose is associated with Zone 3 necrosis, to the point that acute liver failure may result.
The King's College Criteria identify two groups of patients that have a poor prognosis with acetaminophen induced liver failure:
Non-paracetamol acute liver failure.
There are many causes of acute liver failure aside from acetaminophen toxicity; these include viral hepatitis—including hepatitis A (rarely), hepatitis B, hepatitis C (rarely), hepatitis E (especially in pregnant women), Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and varicella zoster virus -- Wilson's disease, the toxin of the death cap mushroom ("Amanita phalloides"), alcohol, autoimmune hepatitis, Budd–Chiari syndrome, other medications (including halothane, hormonal contraception, and isoniazid), recreational drugs (including ecstasy ) and, rarely, tumours infiltrating the liver.
In patients with non-acetaminophen acute liver failure, the following criteria were identified as being associated with a poor prognosis:
Utility in prediction.
The utility of the criteria in determining the prognosis of patients with acute liver failure is defined by their operating characteristics. The positive predictive value of the criteria in predicting death from acute liver failure has ranged from 70% to 100%. A Canadian meta-analysis assessing various prognostic indices found that the specificity of the King's College criteria in predicting mortality exceeded 90%, with a sensitivity of 69%. As a result, the American Society for Study of Liver Diseases has recommended the King's College Criteria as being helpful early parameters in ascertaining the need for liver transplantation in patients with acute liver failure.
Alternatives.
A variety of other calculations have been done based on similar parameters to determine the risk of mortality in acute liver failure. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score has a comparable sensitivity to the King's College Criteria in determining prognosis.

Addio, addio

"Addio, addio" ("Farewell, Farewell") was the entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1962, held in Luxembourg, performed in Italian by Claudio Villa.
Sanremo.
The song had placed first in Sanremo Music Festival 1962 in February 1962, where it had been performed by Domenico Modugno and Claudio Villa as a duo, receiving almost 1.5 million votes from the public.
Eurovision.
With music by Domenico Modugno and lyrics by Franco Migliacci (the same duo had collaborated on Modugno's previous entry "Nel blu dipinto di blu"), the song is a ballad, in which Villa attempts to deal with the end of a relationship. He sings that "our love has become salt like sea water / our parched lips don't have words any longer", but clings to the hope that "it isn't true that our love has ended", indeed even as he farewells his former lover for the last time he sings "we love each other and that we're breaking up".
The song was performed fifteenth on the night, following 's Camillo Felgen with "Petit bonhomme" and preceding 's François Deguelt with "Dis rien". At the close of voting, it had received 3 points, placing 9th in a field of 16. The comparatively high place for a low-scoring song is partly explained by the fact that four entries at this Contest failed to record a point.
It was succeeded as Italian representative at the 1963 contest by Emilio Pericoli with "Uno per tutte".
Single Release.
The song was released as a single by Claudio Villa with the song "Quando il vento d'aprile" as the B side. In addition, Domenico Modugno also released his version of the song as a single, with the song "Lupi e pecorelle" as the B side.

Box Hill Institute

Box Hill Institute is a provider of vocational and higher education, situated in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria. The institute operates across multiple campuses, including three in Box Hill (Elgar, Nelson, and Whitehorse), one in Lilydale (Lilydale Lakeside), and a city campus in Melbourne's central business district, where it is co-located with the Centre for Adult Education.
History.
Box Hill Institute is the descendant of two Box Hill area technical schools.
"Box Hill Technical School for Girls and Women" was opened on the 4th of September 1924, having welcomed 65 Junior pupils some six months before. The girls primary studied domestic subjects like housewifery, cookery, millinery and dressmaking. Some girls also took courses like accounting and secretarial work.
On the 2nd of February 1943 the "Box Hill Technical School for Boys" was established because many boys in the eastern suburbs were being turned away from Swinburne Technical School. They studied subjects like sheetmetal work, technical drawing and carpentry.
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s both technical schools added post-secondary options like certificates in business studies and engineering. The Girls' Technical School started the first business certificate course in 1967.
The Girls' Technical School was renamed "Whitehorse Technical School" in 1971. Around this time the Boys' Technical School separated its tertiary technical offerings from the secondary ones, the tertiary section becoming "Box Hill Technical School". Both schools were declared colleges of Technical and Further Education in late 1981.
On the 25th of January 1984, Whitehorse Technical School and Box Hill Technical School merged to become "Box Hill College of TAFE". 
On the 12 September 1995, the Governor in Council approved orders to change the name of Box Hill College of TAFE to Box Hill Institute of TAFE. The College was renamed "Box Hill Institute" ten years later.
Courses.
Higher education.
Box Hill Institute offers a range of higher education courses at a Masters, Graduate, and Undergraduate level. It covers areas such as biotechnology, animal science, music, music business, fashion, business, IT and more.
Vocational education.
Box Hill Institute offers a large range of vocational courses. It covers areas including hospitality, tourism, health, beauty, automotive, transport, carpentry, electrical, refrigeration, construction, plumbing, engineering, business, commerce, art, graphic design, dance, music, fashion, live production, English, English as an additional language, ELICOS, VCAL, VCE and more.

Impedance of free space

In electromagnetism, the impedance of free space, , is a physical constant relating the magnitudes of the electric and magnetic fields of electromagnetic radiation travelling through free space. That is,

where is the electric field strength, and is the magnetic field strength. Its presently accepted value is
where Ω is the ohm, the SI unit of electrical resistance. The impedance of free space (that is, the wave impedance of a plane wave in free space) is equal to the product of the vacuum permeability and the speed of light in vacuum . Before 2019, the values of both these constants were taken to be exact (they were given in the definitions of the ampere and the metre respectively), and the value of the impedance of free space was therefore likewise taken to be exact. However, with the revision of the SI that came into force on 20 May 2019, the impedance of free space as expressed with an SI unit is subject to experimental measurement because only the speed of light in vacuum retains an exactly defined value.
Terminology.
The analogous quantity for a plane wave travelling through a dielectric medium is called the "intrinsic impedance" of the medium and designated (eta). Hence is sometimes referred to as the "intrinsic impedance of free space", and given the symbol . It has numerous other synonyms, including:

Aleksandr Petrovich Burago () was an officer of the Russian Imperial army. Serving as a captain under Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko, he commanded the force that liberated Plovdiv from the Ottoman rule on 16 January 1878. Later on Burago became a colonel. He died of tuberculosis at the age of 30, in 1883, on Madeira, and was buried in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in Saint Petersburg.
In recognition of his "excellence demonstrated in the battle ... whereupon, together with a squadron of dragoons, having crossed the Maritsa river ... entered the city, still occupied by the Turkish division ... an almost 25 times greater in numbers enemy force", Burago was awarded the Order of St. George of the 4th degree.
Citizens of Plovdiv traditionally honour captain Burago annually on January 16, the anniversary of the liberation of the city. Wreaths and floral tributes are brought to the monument to Burago in the Plovdiv City Garden. A street in Plovdiv was named after captain Burago. In November 2006, along with several other prominent personalities, Aleksandr Burago was, "for exceptional service in development of the city of Plovdiv" posthumously awarded the title of "Honorary citizen of Plovdiv", by decision of the local community council.

Davina Whitehouse

 
Davina Whitehouse (born Eileen Eliza Smith; 16 December 1912 – 25 December 2002), also known by the stage name Davina Craig before her marriage, was an English-born actress, acclaimed for her roles on stage and film in her native land in the 1930s and early 1940s and in New Zealand from the 1950s where she continued her career as an actress. She was also a radio and stage producer and director, and from the early 1970s she worked in Australia primarily in television serials.
Early life and family.
Born Eileen Eliza Smith in London on 16 December 1912, Whitehouse was the daughter of Scottish-born David Smith and Florence Smith (née King). Her father died when she was two years old, and she was renamed Davina in his memory. Her mother remarried an ex-soldier 10 years later.
In 1941 she married John Henry Archibald Whitehouse, and in 1952 they and their children emigrated to New Zealand. Davina Whitehouse became a naturalised New Zealand citizen in 1977.
Career.
Britain (1929–1952).
Whitehouse having attended a boarding school, was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art aged 15, and graduated in 1929. Using the stage name Davina Craig, her acting roles were initially rare, but in 1932 she was seen by Ivor Novello and he offered her a role in a touring play, "I Lived with You", which later was made into the 1933 film of the same name, for which Whitehouse receive critical praise. She was then signed by Twickenham Film Studios, and between 1933 and 1939, Whitehouse appeared in over 40 films, most commonly playing a comic servant, but she also had some larger roles, including in "The Private Secretary" in 1935.
New Zealand and Australia (1952–2001).
In New Zealand Whitehouse soon gained work as an actor and director of radio drama, and became the executive producer of radio drama for the NZBC. She also acted at Downstage Theatre following its establishment in 1964. In 1984 Whitehouse played Granna in the world premiere of Renée's "Wednesday to Come" at Downstage Theatre.
Whitehouse's television career began in 1972, appearing in the TV play "An Awful Silence". In 1977 became co-host of the TV chat show "Two on One" with Ray Woolf. For eight years, Whitehouse was a regular panellist on the advice show "Beauty and the Beast", hosted by Selwyn Toogood. She had acting roles in New Zealand's first TV soap opera, "Close to Home", as well as "Country GP", the third season of "Gloss" (1989), "Marlin Bay", and a 30-minute monologue in the series "Face Value" (1995).
On Australian television, Whitehouse appeared in numerous of the Crawford Productions series, including "Matlock Police" and "The Box", as well as playing the role of Maggie May Kennedy in the Grundy production, "Prisoner". She made cameo appearances in films including "Sleeping Dogs" (1977), "Solo" (1977), and "Braindead" (1992). She played a former opera diva in the 1977 Australian TV movie "The Night Nurse", and appeared as herself in Peter Jackson's 1995 mockumentary, "Forgotten Silver".
Beginning in 1978, Whitehouse served a four-year term on the board of the New Zealand Film Commission.
Honours and awards.
Whitehouse won for Best Actor at the 1973 Feltex Awards for her role in "An Awful Silence". In 1978 she won the Best Actress "Sammy" for "The Night Nurse" at the Australian Film and Television Awards.
In the 1985 Queen's Birthday Honours, Whitehouse was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the performing arts, and in 1987 she was the subject of an episode of the New Zealand version of "This is Your Life". In 1990, Whitehouse was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. Whitehouse received a best actress nomination for "Face Value" at the 1997 New Zealand film and television awards, and she received the Rudall Hayward Award for lifetime achievement in films at the 1998 New Zealand film and television awards.
Later life and death.
Whitehouse wrote her autobiography, "Davina – An Acting Life", published in 1999. She died on 25 December 2002 in Auckland, following a series of strokes. She was predeceased by her husband, Archie Whitehouse, and survived by their two children.

Khlong Phasi Charoen

Khlong Phasi Charoen (, ) is a canal west of the Chao Phraya River in the Thonburi area of the Bangkok conurbation. The canal links the Tha Chin River to Khlong Bangkok Yai. It starts at Khlong Bangkok Yai near "Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen", Bangkok and ends south of "Wat Ang Thong", Tambon Don Kai Di, Krathum Baen District, Samut Sakhon Province. It is approximately long.
The canal project was initiated by Phra Phasi Sombat Boriboon (พระภาษีสมบัติบริบูรณ์), who later became Phraya Phison Sombat Boriboon (พระยาพิสณฑ์สมบัติบริบูรณ์). Originally Phasi Charoen proposed to fund the project in exchange for the right to collect tolls. It was approved by King Mongkut (Rama IV). Its 112,000 baht cost was financed via tax deductions from the amount Phra Phasi Sombat Boriboon collected, thus making the canal toll-free. Construction began in 1866 and was completed in 1872. Water flows were controlled by two advanced mechanical water gates, designed by a Dutch architect to use in transporting sugar.
The expansion of Khlong Phasi Charoen to reach the Tha Chin River, which is the route to the Gulf of Thailand, is due to the French blockade of Gulf of Thai estuary in 1893 (Paknam incident). King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) concerned about no passage to the sea during the blockade. He decided that the canal should be built to provide another area passage. 
Khlong Phasi Charoen was the location used for filming the boat chase scene in "The Man with the Golden Gun" in 1974.

Love Can Move Mountains

"Love Can Move Mountains" is a song by Canadian singer Celine Dion, recorded for her second English-language studio album, "Celine Dion" (1992). Written by Diane Warren and produced by Ric Wake, it was released as the fourth single in October 1992 by Columbia and Epic Records. It is an up-tempo dance-pop song drawing influence from gospel, and its lyrics detail the abilities that love has as an emotion. The accompanying music video was directed by Jeb Brian, featuring Dion performing in a county fair. "Love Can Move Mountains" was later included on Dion's greatest hits albums, "All the Way... A Decade of Song" in 1999 and "" in 2008.
Commercial performance.
"Love Can Move Mountains" was a hit on the club charts in the US, reaching number five on the "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Play chart. The single hit number two in Canada and reached number 36 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 in the US. It enjoyed a moderate success in the rest of the world.
The B-side, an unreleased track "Cry Just a Little", produced by Ric Wake, and written by the songwriting team of Lotti Golden and Tommy Faragher, is a cover of a song from E. G. Daily's 1989 album "Lace Around the Wound". It is the second cover of Daily that Dion recorded as in 1987 she did a French adaptation of "Love in the Shadows" called "Délivre-moi".
"Love Can Move Mountains" was remixed for the clubs by Tommy Musto (Tommy Musto's 7" Edit, Club Mix, Underground Vocal Mix, Underground Instrumental, Club Dub, Underground Dub), Ric Wake and Richie Jones (Wake &amp; Jones Dub), and by Daniel Abraham (Daniel Abrahams 7" Edit).
"Love Can Move Mountains" (Club Mix) won the Juno Award for Dance Recording of the Year and the original version was nominated for the Juno Award for Single of the Year.
Critical reception.
AllMusic editor Jose F. Promis gave the song a score of three out of five stars, noting that there are two remixed radio edits of "Love Can Move Mountains", "one bouncy and the other sleek, and two housey club versions, similar to most dance music from the early '90s in that it seemed to possess a since-lost elegance and a since-lost innocence". Another AllMusic editor, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, named the song a standout of the album, along with "If You Asked Me To" and "Beauty and the Beast". Larry Flick from "Billboard" magazine complimented it as a "delicious, gospel-influenced pop/dance anthem with open arms" and a "uplifting, rousing gem". He noted that Dion "takes advantage of the opportunity to cut loose with a big, belted vocal-though she wisely keeps her usual penchant for melodrama down to a minimum". Randy Clark from "Cashbox" felt the "upbeat, gospel-flavored" single "proves once again this Canadian import is a force to be reckoned with in the '90s." He added, "Celine is now expanding her commerciality with this soulful, yet danceable track on which she is backed with a rich choir." 
"Chicago Tribune" editor Jan DeKnock named it "an effective journey into gospel". Dave Sholin from the "Gavin Report" wrote that producer Ric Wake is best known for his work with Taylor Dayne, "but this time he adds just the right edge to Celine Dion's powerful vocal approach. It's evident that she was pouring every ounce of emotion possible into this Diane Warren song, giving it a gospel-like quality. Since she's best known for her stirring ballads, 'Love Can Move Mountains' will acquaint the public with yet another side to this wonderfully gifted and very versatile songstress". A reviewer from "Music &amp; Media" described it as a "gospel-framed song set to modern beats". Parry Gettelman from "Orlando Sentinel" felt Dion "really excels", on a dance track "in the Lisa Stansfield mold".
Music video.
The music video for "Love Can Move Mountains", which shows Dion singing the song in a county fair, was made for the Daniel Abraham's 7" edit, by director Jeb Brian and released in November 1992. It appeared on Dion's DVD video collection "All the Way… A Decade of Song &amp; Video" (2001).
Live performances.
"Love Can Move Mountains" has been a part of every one of Dion's tours since 1992. Dion performed this song also five nights a week during her show "A New Day..." at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas and during her BST Hyde Park concert in London on 5 July 2019.
Dion performed the song during the halftime show at the 1992 Grey Cup game in Toronto.
Live versions of "Love Can Move Mountains" can be found on the 1994 "À l'Olympia" CD, the "Au coeur du stade" DVD, the "" DVD/CD, and the "Céline une seule fois / Live 2013" DVD/CD.
In 1998, Dion re-recorded "Love Can Move Mountains" with a gospel group God's Property, for the soundtrack of the popular CBS-TV drama "Touched by an Angel". She also appeared as herself on one episode of the series, titled "Psalm 151", and performed the song.

Kurdaitcha

A kurdaitcha, or kurdaitcha man, also spelt gadaidja, cadiche, kadaitcha, karadji, or kaditcha (Arrernte orthography: kwertatye), is a type of shaman and traditional executioner amongst the Arrernte people, an Aboriginal group in Central Australia. The name featherfoot is used to denote the same figure by other Aboriginal peoples.
The kurdaitcha may be brought in to punish a guilty party by death. The word may also relate to the ritual in which the death is willed by the kurdaitcha man, known also as bone-pointing. The word may also be used by Europeans to refer to the shoes worn by the kurdaitcha, which are woven of feathers and human hair and treated with blood.
Background.
Among traditional Indigenous Australians there is no such thing as a belief in natural death. All deaths are considered to be the result of evil spirits or spells, usually influenced by an enemy. Often, a dying person will whisper the name of the person they think caused their death. If the identity of the guilty person is not known, a "magic man" will watch for a sign, such as an animal burrow leading from the grave showing the direction of the home of the guilty party. This may take years but the identity is always eventually discovered. The elders of the mob that the deceased belonged to then hold a meeting to decide a suitable punishment. A kurdaitcha may or may not be arranged to avenge them.
Illapurinja.
An "illapurinja", literally "the changed one", is a female kurdaitcha who is secretly sent by her husband to avenge some wrong, most often the failure of a woman to cut herself as a mark of sorrow on the death of a family member. Believed to be entirely mythical, the fear of the illapurinja would be enough to induce following the custom.
20th century.
The practice of kurdaitcha had died out completely in southern Australia by the 20th century although it was still carried out infrequently in the north.
In a report in by the "Adelaide Advertiser" in 1952, some Indigenous men had died in The Granites gold mine in the Tanami Desert, after reporting a sighting of a kurdaitcha man. They were very scared and danced a corroboree to chase evil spirits away. Anthropologist Ted Strehlow and doctors brought in to investigate said that the deaths were most likely caused by malnutrition and pneumonia, and Strehlow said that Aboriginal belief in "black magic" was in general dying out.
Kurdaitcha shoes.
Europeans also used the name kurdaitcha (or kadaitcha) to refer to a distinctive type of oval feathered shoes, apparently worn by the kurdaitcha (man). The Indigenous names for these shoes are "interlinia" in northern Australia and "intathurta" in the south. The soles are made of emu feathers, and the uppers of human hair or animal fur. Most of the early European descriptions state that human blood was used as the principal binding agent; however Kim Akerman noted that although human blood might indeed have been used to charge the shoes with magical power (turning invisible), it is likely felting was the main method used to bind the parts together. The upper surface is covered with a net woven from human hair. An opening in the centre allows the foot to be inserted.
In some instances the shoes were allowed to be seen by women and children; in others, it was taboo for anyone but an adult man to see them. When not in use they were kept wrapped in kangaroo skin or hidden in a sacred place. Although they were permitted to be used more than once, they usually did not last more than one journey. When in use, they were decorated with lines of white and pink down and were said to leave no tracks.
Spencer and Gillen noted that the genuine kurdaitcha shoe has a small opening on one side where a dislocated big toe can be inserted.
In 1896 Patrick Byrne, a self-taught anthropologist at Charlotte Waters telegraph station, published a paper entitled "Note on the customs connected with the use of so-called kurdaitcha shoes of Central Australia" in the "Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria". The paper was described as a "...careful piecing together of kurdaitcha revenge technique from accounts obtained from old men in the Charlotte Waters area in 1892".
Aboriginal people also began to make kurdaitcha shoes for sale to Europeans, and Spencer and Gillen noted seeing ones that were in fact far too small to have actually been worn. Until the 1970s these shoes were a popular craft item, made to sell to visitors to many sites in the central and Western Desert areas of Australia.
Bone pointing.
The expectation that death would result from having a bone pointed at a victim is not without foundation. Other similar rituals that cause death have been recorded around the world. Victims become listless and apathetic, usually refusing food or water with death often occurring within days of being "cursed". When victims survive, it is assumed that the ritual was faulty in its execution. The phenomenon is recognised as psychosomatic in that death is caused by an emotional response—often fear—to some suggested outside force and is known as "voodoo death". As this term refers to a specific religion, the medical establishment has suggested that "self-willed death", or "bone-pointing syndrome" is more appropriate. In Australia, the practice is still common enough that hospitals and nursing staff are trained to manage illness caused by "bad spirits" and bone pointing.
Examples.
The following story is related about the role of kurdaitcha by anthropologists John Godwin and Ronald Rose:
In 2004, an Indigenous Australian woman who disagreed with the abolition of the Aboriginal-led government body Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission cursed the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, by pointing a bone at him.
In popular culture.
An act of kurdaitcha initiates both legal and cultural conflict in Peter Weir's 1977 film "The Last Wave."

<doc id="7001850" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7001850" title="Pallasca District">
Pallasca District

Pallasca District is one of 11 districts of the Pallasca Province in the Ancash region in Peru.
Location.
Located in the North end of the Ancash Mountain range, Pallasca is one of eleven districts of the Province of the same name and is bordered, in the south, by the districts of Huacaschuqué and Huandoval;
in the east, by Lacabambá and Pampas; in the west, by Bolognesí, and in the north by Santiago de Chuco Province in La Libertad. It is situated approximately 3150 metres above sea level.
The population of the District of Pallasca is 5000 inhabitants.
Geography climate, economy, flora and fauna.
According to the geographic classification made by Dr. Javier Pulgar Vidal, Pallasca lies within the denominated Quechua Region. For that reason, its climate is relatively tempered, which does not prevent torrential rains between the months of November and March which feed the territory's crops which are the basic sustenance of the town.
The fact that it belongs to the Quechua Region does not, however, mean that the ancestral Language of the Incas is spoken there.
Pallasca is basically an agrarian district, dedicated mainly to the culture of la papa, maize and wheat; being, in addition, significant the gained raising of "ganado vacuno"and "lanar"; another occupation, in smaller scale, is artisanal crafts, mainly in the weave of "bayetas" (floorcloths), ponchos, "etc."
Among the typical vegetation of the zone, it is possible to cultivate two aromatic plants, "úñicá" and " panizará", used locally as infusions; these plants which could be commercialized on a great scale, would generate significant economic income for the population and, would also be an alternative (and perhaps more pleasant) beverage to the tea and other products.
The pallasquina flora is rich and varied. Some of the known plants or typical vegetation are as follows: yerba santa, Shiraque, tarsana, penca (maguey), molle, willows, carhuacasha; mora (blackberry), payaya, shugurom, purpuro (tumbo); Panizo, úñica; chulco, Achupallas; Aliza, eucalyptus. 
In addition, there are: wheat, potatoes, maize, quinoa, Coy (quiwicha), oca, etc.
Access.
The District of Pallasca can be accessed from Chimbote on the Coast, by a hard road whose construction in the final section, from Sacaycacha, was obtained thanks to the collective efforts of inhabitants in 1973, led by Orlando Alvarez Castro, a Captain of the Peruvian Army. Pallasca is practically interconnected with all the towns of the Province by means of hard roads that they had, because is enough, to be paved to obtain a faster, comfortable and advisable access.
Folklore.
In June each year, Pallasca celebrates the Feast in the honor of the region's patron saint, San Juan Baustista. In such occasion some beautiful folkloric patterns/tapestries (known as "festejos" in Pallasca), among which are the Suplicio and death of the Atahualpá Inca, the one of whose typical characters is "Quishpe"; the Osos, Quiyayas, Blanquillos, Indian Culculbambá, etc. also appear.
Other pleasing elements of the festival are the races of "cintas" and "pedradas". Its centrepiece is the massive and fervent processions in tribute to the patron saint.
History.
Pallasca has history that goes back to the earliest times of la Spanish Conquest. Serious studies indicate that its name would come from Apollacsa Vilca Yupanqui Tuquiguarac, important noble Peruvian native who served during the passage of the first conquistadores, thus would have received coat of arms, according to the historian Felix Álvarez Brun in his book "Ancash, a regional Peruvian history".
A fact which is apparently not so well known is that the corpse of Huáscar, the last legitimate heir of the Incan Empire, was thrown in waters of the River Tablachacá (formerly, Andamarca) by the Spanish conquistadores.
In the independence war, the district shared in the goals of the Peruvian people and the region contributed to its quota of men and equipment for the formation of the Army of liberation.
When the Chilean invasion took place, patriotic Peruvians refused to follow the abusive orders of the military leaders of the enemy force and preferred to face the enemy in unequal battle, with sticks, stones and hand-thrown weapons, resulting in thousands of dead and injured.

The American Band

The American Band is a community band based in Providence, Rhode Island. It was founded as a military band in 1837 by Joseph C. Greene. During its early years, the members were the highest paid in the country – even higher than the New York Philharmonic in its first season. Since its founding, the band has performed near-continuously until the present day, and is one of the oldest bands in the country still performing. Many of the members are music educators, and others are involved in other careers.
History.
The band was incorporated in 1837 as the American Brass Band, a 15-piece ensemble of brass instruments and drums, by bugle soloist Joseph C. Greene.
The D.W. Reeves years.
The band was directed by noted march composer D. W. Reeves, one of America's foremost conductors, from 1866 until his death in 1900. In the years following the American Civil War, Reeves grew the ensemble into a professional organization, performing on tours across the United States. Reeves added flutes, clarinets, oboes, bassoons and the recently invented saxophones to the band's repertoire.
Bowen R. Church.
Valley Falls native Bowen R. Church (1860–1923) was a master cornet soloist. Reeves invited Church, then a young musical prodigy, to join the band after an impromptu audition on a train, and thereafter became his mentor. Church eventually became a headliner of the band, and briefly led the band after Reeves' death in 1900.
Warren Fales.
A 1914 advertisement listed Warren R. Fales as the director of the band, and noted that band members "are exempt from Jury Duty." The ad noted that the band had performed at Brown University's commencement "every year for the past 50 years."
Decline and revival.
Following Reeves' death in 1900, the band became more of a local community group playing local concerts and parades. By the 1970s, facing dwindling membership, the band eventually ceased performing entirely, until it was revived by Dr. Francis Marciniak in 1978. Marciniak led the band until 1996.
In the 21st century, the band has been recognized as one of the best symphonic bands in southeast New England, and was inducted into the Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame in 2020.

Alavere, Harju County

Alavere is a village in Anija Parish, Harju County in northern Estonia. The population was 345 in 2019.
History.
Alavere was first mentioned in 1241 in the "Liber Census Daniæ," during the reign of King Valdemar II of Denmark, as "Hauaueeræ". The village center of present-day was built up around a manor house, dating from the 1620s. The Allafer Manor () of the former passed between the hands of several families throughout the centuries, notably the Baltic German Löwensterns in the 18th century and the Ungern-Sternbergs in the 19th century. The main building of the mansion, built by Baron Gregor von Ungern-Sternberg in 1852, was heavily damaged by local peasants during the 1905 Revolution but was rebuilt.

Strauss Group

Strauss Group Ltd. (), formerly known as Strauss-Elite (), is an Israeli manufacturer and marketer of consumer foods sold through retail stores. It is among the largest food manufacturers in Israel. Strauss Group focuses on dairy products, coffee, water, snacks, salads, and dips. Its subsidiary Strauss Coffee is a leading coffee company in Eastern Europe and Brazil. Strauss Group is a public company traded in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, with the majority of its shares (57%) owned by the Strauss family.
Strauss Group has 15,000 employees worldwide and is active in more than 20 countries.
History.
In 1918, Eliyahu Fromenchenko (also spelled Fromchenko), a Russian Jew, launched a candy business after preparing confections in his home kitchen. In 1924, after the rise of Communism in the Soviet Union, he moved to Latvia and merged the company with Laima in Riga. In 1933, he sold his stakes in Laima and immigrated to Mandatory Palestine. 
1933–2004: Elite.
Fromenchenko bought property in Ramat Gan and established Elite. Production began in the spring of 1934, with the first product reaching the stores in time for Passover. The company's most popular brand was Shokolad Para, which had an image of a cow ("para") on the packaging. As the company grew, factories opened in Safed and Nazareth Illit. 
In 1958, Elite launched Israel's first coffee company. Its major competition both for chocolates and coffee was Lieber, which it bought out in March 1970. In 1982, Elite launched its popular "Pesek Zman" line of chocolate bars.
The Israeli snack-food market had been traditionally divided by Elite in the sweets market and Osem in the savoury market. In 1991, Elite decided to expand by entering the salty snack market by establishing a new factory in Sderot and specifically producing "Shush", a copy of the Bamba snack, the most popular snack in Israel made by Osem. Elite became the local licensee of Frito-Lay products, producing the best-selling brand "Tapuchips". Later, Elite started selling coffee outside of Israel, especially in Europe and South America. The initiative, "Café 3 Corações", did not reach its objectives, but it signaled Elite's start as an international company.
Elite was labeled a monopoly by the Israel Antitrust Authority, in the markets of instant coffee, black coffee and chocolate fields, and blamed for abusing its monopoly position. In 2006, Elite–Strauss paid a fine of 5 million NIS, without admission of guilt.
1936–2004: Strauss.
Richard and Hilde Strauss, German Jews from Nieder-Olm, immigrated in 1936 to Nahariya in the British Mandate of Palestine and started a dairy farm initially with two cows. Excess production that Richard could not sell was made into cheese by Hilde and soon cheese became the main focus of the business. Dessert products followed. In the 1950s, Strauss added ice-cream products, with about 50 employees in their Nahariya factory.
In 1969, after Groupe Danone purchased a part of the company's ownership, Strauss expanded from ice-cream manufacture into puddings and other individual packaged dairy desserts, most popular of which was "Dani" and, about 15 years later, "Milky". In 1975, Michael Strauss, son of the founders, became the CEO of the company.
In 1995, the company went into the prepared-salads business. The Strauss hummus brand, "Achla", became very popular in Israel. In 1997, the company purchased 50% of the ownership of the Yotvata dairy. In the same year, Strauss purchased Elite and grew to over 7,000 employees and a US$1 billion/year turnover, although the formal merger between the companies did not occur until 2004.
In 2001, Ofra Strauss, Michael's daughter, became the CEO of the company. In the same year, it acquired the Max Brenner chain of chocolate cafés with locations across Asia, Australia and the United States.
Strauss was cited by the Israel Antitrust Authority as a monopoly in 2004, a status that essentially places the company under government regulation limiting the way it can change the price of its products to protect the consumer and smaller competitors.
2004–2007: Strauss–Elite.
Strauss and Elite merged in 2004 to become Strauss–Elite, which, in 2005, acquired control of New York-based Sabra food producing company, to operate as a joint-venture with Frito-Lay, a division of PepsiCo.
In December 2005, Strauss–Elite merged its coffee activity with Santa Clara Indústria e Comércio de Alimentos Ltda in Brazil. The merged company, Santa Clara Participações, is the second largest coffee manufacturer in Brazil.
Since 2007: Strauss Group.
In 2007, the company's name reverted to Strauss with a new corporate logo. Strauss Ice Cream was removed from the Strauss Group portfolio and became private with 51% of the company owned by Unilever, and 49% owned by the Strauss family. Strauss ice creams are marketed under Unilever's Heartbrand in Israel and North America.
The Strauss Group has sold the Max Brenner brand in 2017 to some of the franchisees. In 2022, Strauss Group signed a partnership agreement with Brazil’s São Miguel company to extend their partnership for 20 more years. In 2023, Strauss Group boosted its water business in the UK through its subsidiary, Strauss Water, which has finalized a strategic collaboration with Culligan International.

Ruabon–Barmouth line

The Ruabon–Barmouth line was a standard-gauge line owned by the Great Western Railway across the north of Wales which connected Ruabon, in the east, with Barmouth on the west coast.
History.
The line opened in stages by various companies:
The Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway was absorbed by the Cambrian Railways which, with the other companies, was absorbed into the GWR.
The line was double track from Ruabon (Llangollen Junction) to Llangollen Goods Yard. From there it was single line with passing loops at the following stations: Deeside Halt, , , , , , , , , , , and .
Closure.
The whole line was listed for closure as part of the Beeching Axe. Goods services between Morfa Mawddach (formerly Barmouth Junction) and Llangollen ceased in 1964. Although the whole line was planned to close for passenger services on 18 January 1965, services were suspended on 12 December 1964 following flooding. The section between Ruabon and Llangollen was subsequently reopened on 17 December for passenger trains until 18 January after which only freight services ran until 1968 when the line was closed completely. The section between Llangollen and Bala Junction was abandoned following flooding although a substitute bus service served the stations until 18 January 1965. The section Dolgellau to Morfa Mawddach reopened on 14 December and the section between Bala, Bala Junction and Dolgellau was reopened on 17 December. The whole route closed on 18 January 1965.
Lifting of the track was completed in 1969.
Preservation.
Two stretches of the line have long been reopened as preserved railways; the narrow-gauge Bala Lake Railway in 1972; and the standard-gauge Llangollen Railway which first opened to passengers in 1981.
A section between Barmouth Junction and Dolgellau is used as the Mawddach Trail, a cycle route and bridleway, conversion of which was assisted in 1976 when heavy floods washed away most of the remaining ballast.
Several sections have been used for road improvement schemes, including a section through Dolgellau, and the station site and trackbed west of . The trackbed has also been redeveloped at the west end of Corwen and a number of houses and apartments have been built immediately east of Llangollen. Infringements occur between Llangollen and Acrefair (typically garden extensions and outbuildings) and the cutting through Cefn Mawr is partially blocked following land slips. At the end of Llanuwchllyn station, a house straddles the trackbed. In the countryside between these sites the trackbed remains disused although some sections are used for grazing cattle.
In 2020, a group was formed with the aim of reopening the section from Bala to Llandrillo as a greenway.

Longlands Fell

Longlands Fell is a small fell in the northern part of the English Lake District. It is situated in the high ground known as the Uldale Fells, 5.5 kilometres south west of the village of Caldbeck. It reaches a height of 483 m (1,585 ft) and it is (along with Binsey) the most northerly fell in the Lake District.
Topography.
Longlands Fell is characterised by grassy, smooth slopes which drop down gradually to the lowlands north of Lakeland making the ascent of the fell quite easy from that direction. The other Uldale Fells are Great Sca Fell, Great Cockup and Meal Fell and together are really just one big sheep pasture which does not draw large numbers of fell walkers or visitors, making this probably the quietest part of the national park, the border of which is only two kilometres to the north.
Mining.
Unlike the adjacent Caldbeck Fells, which were heavily mined for minerals, the Uldale Fells have only ever had one mine on them and that was on Longlands Fell. The Longlands Fell copper mine operated in the second half of the 19th century but was soon found to be uneconomical and abandoned, one of the levels is now dammed to provide water to the village of Uldale. Just to the north of Longlands Fell on the adjoining small Aughtertree Fell (300 metres) are signs of an Iron Age farming settlement first settled 3,000 years ago and probably deserted during the Dark Ages.
Ascents.
Longlands Fell is one of the easier fell walks in the Lake District, the ascent starts from the hamlet of Longlands, which is a small group of houses and takes the track north east which skirts the base of the fell, this is part of the low level alternative of the Cumbria Way, when the foot of the northern ridge is reached this is followed up easy slopes to reach the summit. Longlands Fell is often climbed in conjunction with other fells, being connected to the south east by a 2.5 kilometre ridge to Great Sca Fell which in turn gives access along its ridges to the rest of the fells in the area.
Summit.
The view from the top takes in the Solway Firth and the Galloway hills to the north. To the south are good views of Skiddaw with the fells around the Whinlatter forest well seen.

<doc id="7001991" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7001991" title="Official cash rate">
Official cash rate

The official cash rate (OCR) is the term used in Australia and New Zealand for the bank rate and is the rate of interest which the central bank charges on overnight loans between commercial banks. This allows the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to adjust the interest rates that apply in each country's economy. The OCR cannot be changed by transactions between financial institutions as this does not change the supply of money, only its location. Only transfers between the central bank and an institution can affect the OCR.
As banks settle all inter-bank transfers overnight, the central bank can regulate the rate paid for cash by the sale or buy back of bonds and other government issued securities (these are known as domestic market operations). As the sale or purchase of bonds affects the supply of money, then the interest rate will change to reflect its availability. This system indirectly influences the term structure of interest rates in the whole economy. Changes to the official cash rate generally affect the rates on housing and other loans within a matter of days or weeks. Under the Australian system the Reserve Bank of Australia issues its dealing intentions at the start of each day, and banks and other financial institutions will act prior to the actual rate being achieved.
The rate is set by the central banks regularly, usually every month in Australia and every six weeks in New Zealand and forms one of the main tools to manage monetary policy.
Australia.
In Australia, the Cash Rate Target is set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to influence the Interbank Overnight Cash Rate (Cash Rate) on unsecured loans between banks. This rate serves as a near risk-free benchmark rate (RFR) for the Australian dollar and is commonly referred to as AONIA in financial markets. 
The Cash Rate, which represents the weighted average interest rate on overnight unsecured loans in the domestic interbank market, is a key tool for the RBA's monetary policy. It is used to guide interest rates across the economy and serves as a reference rate for Australian dollar overnight indexed swaps (OIS) and the ASX 30-day interbank cash rate futures contract.
Additionally, the Reserve Bank publishes the Cash Rate Total Return Index (TRI), which acts as a public benchmark reflecting the performance of an investment earning the Cash Rate, with reinvested interest, offering a near risk-free rate of return.
RBA Board Meetings.
The RBA Board meets regularly, and following each meeting, a media release is issued at 2:30 pm Sydney Time announcing any changes to the Cash Rate Target, which take effect the next day. They meet eight time a year as of 2024 instead of 11 in prior years. Previously they would meet the first Tuesday of the month excluding January. For 2024 they will meet over two days every month excluding April, July and October. 
The former RBA Governor Philip Lowe said "The less frequent and longer meetings will provide more time for the board to examine issues in detail and to have deeper discussions on monetary policy strategy, alternative policy options and risks, as well as on communication," 
New Zealand.
In New Zealand, the official cash rate (OCR) is set by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to meet the inflation target specified in the Policy Targets Agreement. The current agreement, signed in December 2008, defines price stability as annual increases in the Consumers Price Index (CPI) of between 1–3% on average over the medium term. 
The OCR was introduced in March 1999 and was reviewed eight times a year up to 2015 by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Since 2016, the OCR is reviewed seven times a year. Monetary Policy Statements are issued with the OCR on four of those occasions. Unscheduled adjustments to the OCR may occur at other times in response to unexpected or sudden developments; to date this has occurred only twice, following the September 11 attacks and on March 16, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
What the OCR does.
The OCR influences the price of borrowing money in New Zealand and provides the Reserve Bank with a means of influencing the level of economic activity and inflation. An OCR is a fairly conventional tool by international standards. In the past, the Reserve Bank used a variety of tools to influence inflation, including influencing the supply of money and signaling desired monetary conditions to the financial markets. Such mechanisms were more indirect, more difficult to understand, and less conventional.
A decreased cash rate could mean lower home loan rates for borrowers, but can also mean lower savings and term deposit rates for savers.
How the OCR works.
Most registered banks hold settlement accounts at the Reserve Bank, which are used to settle obligations with each other at the end of the day. For example, if a customer makes out a cheque or makes an EFTPOS payment, the money is paid by their bank to the recipient's bank. Millions of such transactions are made every day. The bank pays interest on settlement account balances, and charges interest on overnight borrowing, at rates related to the OCR. These rates are reviewed from time to time, as is the OCR. The most crucial part of the system is the fact that the Reserve Bank sets no limit on the amount of cash it will borrow or lend at rates related to the OCR.
As a result, market interest rates are generally held around the Reserve Bank's OCR level. The practical result, over time, is that when market interest rates increase, people are inclined to spend less on goods and services. This is because their savings get a higher rate of interest and there is an incentive to save; and conversely, people with mortgages and other loans may experience higher interest payments.
When people save more or spend less, there is less pressure on prices to rise, and therefore inflation pressures tend to reduce. Although the OCR influences New Zealand's market interest rates, it is not the only factor doing so. Market interest rates—particularly for longer terms—are also affected by the interest rates prevailing offshore since New Zealand financial institutions are net borrowers in overseas financial markets. Movements in overseas rates can lead to changes in interest rates even if the OCR has not changed.

Frank Zappa in popular culture

As an icon of counterculture and underground rock the American rock musician and composer Frank Zappa has been featured and referenced in various different media.
Biology.
In the 1980s, biologist Ed Murdy named a genus of gobiid fishes of New Guinea "Zappa" after Zappa, stating that he liked "his music... his politics and principles" and that "the name itself is a good one for scientific nomenclature."
Biologist Ferdinando Boero named a phialellid jellyfish "Phialella zappai" in order to get the chance to meet the musician. A Zappa concert in Genoa focused largely on the jellyfish and on Dr. Boero. A small portion of this concert was released on "" as "Lonesome Cowboy Nando". Zappa stated, "There is nothing I'd like better than to have a jellyfish named after me."
Other species named after Zappa include a fossil snail named "Amaurotoma zappa" and the Cameroonese spider "Pachygnatha zappa", so named because a marking on the female's ventral surface resembles the Zappa mustache. A gene of the bacterium "Proteus mirabilis" that causes urinary tract infection is named "zapA" (others are named "zapB" through "zapE").

Bedford TJ

The Bedford TJ is a truck that was produced by Bedford and its successors from 1958 to 1998, as a replacement for the earlier Bedford A series of medium-duty trucks that were built between 1953 and 1958. The TJ was the last bonneted truck produced by the company, and the last vehicle to be produced to have a relation with Bedford.
History.
Production of the Bedford TJ began in 1958 as Bedford’s new bonneted truck model, and was a modernised version of the Bedford TD series, modelled after the Chevrolet Advance Design truck. The TJ truck was produced in many versions, ranging from light pickups to heavy-duty vehicles, with payloads up to 6-8 tons. Unfortunately, due to their relatively dated styling and presumably since bonneted trucks were falling out of favor these years, the TJ series was not very popular in the United Kingdom and did not sell in big numbers, with the exception of the AA and Post Office Telephones. In particular, Holland's Pies in Lancashire used a large fleet of TJ vans well into the 1980s, being notable for being kept in very clean condition and this resulted in the TJ being often called a 'Holland's pie van' around Lancashire.
The lightest versions (J0) shared the same petrol engine as the Vauxhall Cresta, which offered relatively good performance, although it could not cope very well with loads over 800-900 kg. It sold in relatively good numbers in Britain and export markets throughout the 1960s and 1970s, before being replaced by the Bedford KB in 1973. Heavier variants used the same engine as on the Bedford TD series. In export markets, specifically in countries such as India, Pakistan, Africa and other developing nations, the TJ sold in great numbers due to its reliability and relatively low price compared to the competition. In 1975, the TJ was withdrawn from the UK market and superseded by the Bedford CF.
After 1975, the TJ was offered only for export where it was pretty successful, however, during the 1980s, exports to countries such as Australia and New Zealand stopped since it was clear that these trucks were very outdated, and couldn't compete in the market anymore due to changing emissions and regulations. Nevertheless, it continued production for export to developing countries. In 1987, the Dunstable plant was sold to David J.B. Brown and became AWD Trucks. Production of the TJ continued under the AWD Bedford badge. After Marshall SPV purchased AWD Trucks, production of the TJ series continued, but in limited numbers. The last TJ trucks were built in 1998, when an order was placed for 100 trucks to be exported to Kenya. 
Nigeria.
The Bedford TJ was assembled in Bedford's Nigerian plant in Apapa (Tin Can Island) by UACN, a Unilever operation which was 60 percent Nigerian-owned. By the end of the 1970s, the TJ was the most sold Bedford product in Nigeria, which was Bedford's main export market outside of Europe at the time.
Pakistan.
In Pakistan, the J5/6 is very popular and dominated commercial vehicular traffic. It has a cult status among drivers and is known for its power, reliability, and durability. Over half of the trucks in Pakistan are Bedford vehicles.
India.
An Indian company, Hindustan Motors, also produced the larger versions (J5/6) of the vehicle in that country from 1968. Production lasted for three decades, but the vehicle proved to be unable to compete with Tata and Ashok Leyland vehicles and was finally discontinued in 1998.
Australia.
The TJ was widely exported. In Australia they were distributed by Holden.
Malaysia.
Bedford TJ trucks were also produced in Malaysia from knock-down kits until the early 1980s. Towards the end of this period, after Bedford vehicles had lost their market lead, the TJ shared the assembly line with competing trucks from Toyota. As the design aged, Bedford's reputation shrank, the British pound went up, while Britain itself lost much of its standing in Malaysia. GM instead chose to focus more on promoting trucks from corporate stablemate Isuzu in that market. The TJ trucks were replaced by the Isuzu TX trucks.

Jockey-Club de Paris

The Jockey Club de Paris is a traditional gentlemen's club and is regarded as the most prestigious of private clubs in Paris. It is best remembered as a gathering place of the elite of nineteenth-century French society. Today it is decidedly but not exclusively aristocratic. The club seat is at 2, rue Rabelais in Paris, near the Champs-Élysées and it hosts the International Federation of Racing Authorities.
It no longer has official links to the horse-racing industry organisations, which are separate professional bodies.
History.
The Jockey Club was originally organized as the "Society for the Encouragement of the Improvement of Horse Breeding in France", to provide a single authority for horse racing in the nation, beginning at Chantilly in 1834. It swiftly became the center for the most "sportifs" or "sportsmen" gentlemen of "le Tout-Paris." At the same time, when aristocrats and men of the "haute bourgeoisie" still formed the governing class, its Anglo-Gallic membership could not fail to give it some political colour: Napoleon III, who had passed some early exile in England, asserted that he had learned to govern an empire through "his intercourse with the calm, self-possessed men of the English turf".
Between 1833 and 1860, the Jockey Club transformed the Champ de Mars into a racecourse, which has since been transferred to Longchamp. One front of the Café de la Paix is in rue Scribe, which ends at the façade of the Opéra Garnier. On the wall is a memorial plaque on the Hotel Scribe, at number 1, which records the former premises of the Jockey Club, which occupied luxurious quarters on the first floor from 1863 to 1913.
During the Second Empire and the Third Republic, the gentlemen of the Jockey Club held numerous boxes at the Opera ("many little suspended salons" in Marcel Proust's phrase), where the required ballet expected in every opera was never in the first act, when the Jockey Club would habitually still be at dinner. One result was the famous fiasco of the "Paris "Tannhäuser"" of 1861, when Wagner insisted on inserting the requisite ballet into the first act, placing it immediately after the overture to get it out of the way. The second act, when the members of the Jockey Club arrived to view their favourites in the corps de ballet, was all but hissed off the stage. Wagner never permitted another production in Paris. Proust made his fictional character Charles Swann a member of the Jockey Club as a signal honor, given Swann's Jewish background.
On the ground floor beneath the Jockey Club was the fashionable Grand Café. There, on 28 December 1895, a stylish crowd in the "Salon Indien" attended the public début of the Lumière brothers' invention, the cinematograph.
The Jockey Club is directed by an annually-elected committee of a president, four vice-presidents and twenty-five members. New members are sponsored by two current members and must receive five-sixths of the members' votes present at the ballot. Hence 'No' votes, called black-balls require five 'Yes' votes, or white balls to be countered. Black and white balls are no more in use but for vocabulary.
Prix du Jockey Club.
Under the patronage of the Jockey Club, the "Prix du Jockey Club" (1,500,000 euros) has been run at the Chantilly Racecourse (at the foot of the Château de Chantilly) on the first Sunday in June since 1836. The race at the "Hippodrome de Chantilly" is the proving-ground of the best of the three-year-olds, the French equivalent of The Derby at Epsom Downs or the Kentucky Derby in the USA.
Until 2004, the course was 2400 meters; since then, it has been run at 2100 meters. In France, only the "Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe" has a richer purse (5,000,000 euros); that race was inaugurated by the Jockey Club in 1863 as the Grand Prix de Paris, and run at the Hippodrome de Longchamp. The racecourse was painted by Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, and Pablo Picasso, among others.

Men Like Gods

Men Like Gods (1923) is a novel, referred to by the author as a "scientific fantasy", by English writer H. G. Wells. It features a utopia located in a parallel universe.
Plot summary.
"Men Like Gods" is set in the summer of 1921. Its protagonist is Mr. Barnstaple (his first name is either Alfred or William), a journalist working in London and living in Sydenham. He has grown dispirited at a newspaper called "The Liberal" and resolves to take a holiday. Taking leave of his wife and family, his plans are disrupted when his and two other automobiles are accidentally transported with their passengers into "another world," which the "Earthlings" call Utopia.
A sort of advanced Earth, Utopia is some three thousand years ahead of humanity in its development. For the 200,000,000 Utopians who inhabit this world, the "Days of Confusion" are a distant period studied in history books, but their past resembles humanity's in its essentials, differing only in incidental details: their Christ, for example, died on the wheel, not on the cross. Utopia lacks any world government and functions as a successfully realised anarchy. "Our education is our government," a Utopian named Lion says. Sectarian religion, like politics, has died away, and advanced scientific research flourishes. Life in Utopia is governed by "the Five Principles of Liberty", which are privacy, free movement, unlimited knowledge, truthfulness, and free discussion (allowing criticism).
"Men Like Gods" is divided into three books. Details of life in Utopia are given in Books I and III. In Book II, the Earthlings are quarantined on a rocky crag after infections they have brought cause a brief epidemic in Utopia. There they begin to plot the conquest of Utopia, despite Mr. Barnstaple's protests. He betrays them when his fellows try to take two Utopians hostage, forcing Mr. Barnstaple to escape execution for treason by fleeing perilously.
In Book III, Mr. Barnstaple longs to stay, but when he asks how he can best serve Utopia, he is told that he can do this "by returning to your own world". Regretfully he accepts and ends his month-long stay in Utopia. But he brings with him back to Earth a renewed determination to contribute to the effort to make a terrestrial Utopia: "[H]e belonged now soul and body to the Revolution, to the Great Revolution that is afoot on Earth; that marches and will never desist nor rest again until old Earth is one city and Utopia set up therein. He knew clearly that this Revolution is life, and that all other living is a trafficking of life with death."
Critical response.
Contemporary reviews of the novel were largely positive, though some found the story weakly plotted. As is often the case in his later fiction, Wells's utopian enthusiasm exceeded his interest in scientific romance or fantasy (his own terms for what is now called science fiction). The novel was yet another vehicle for Wells to propagate ideas of a possible better future society, also attempted in several other works, notably in "A Modern Utopia" (1905). "Men Like Gods" and other novels like it provoked Aldous Huxley to write "Brave New World" (1932), a parody and critique of Wellsian utopian ideas.
Wells himself later commented on the novel: "It did not horrify or frighten, was not much of a success, and by that time, I had tired of talking in playful parables to a world engaged in destroying itself."
Themes.
Several characters in the novel are directly taken from the politics of the 1920s. Rupert Catskill probably represents Winston Churchill, as he was seen at that time: a reckless adventurer. Catskill is depicted as a reactionary ideologue, criticises Utopia for its apparent decadence, and leads the attempted conquest of Utopia. Wells had once been a political ally of Churchill, who admired his novels and was a social reformer earlier in his career, and had endorsed him in the 1908 Manchester North West by-election. By 1923 he had become disillusioned with him over his role in the Dardanelles Campaign and the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War.
"Men Like Gods" is notable for a number of set pieces: a description of telepathy, which has become the standard means of communication among Utopians and which enables them to communicate in the languages of the Earthlings (English and French); a meditation on mortality; a reflection on the continuing distinctions between the races in Utopia, there being little interbreeding as a matter of individual choice, although social intercourse is free; a description of how society could function without money; a denunciation of Marxism; a description of a wireless communication device; and several discussions of multiple universes.

Chris Greenacre

Christopher Mark Greenacre (born 23 December 1977) is an English football manager and former player who is the head coach of the Wellington Phoenix FC Reserves. 
Greenacre began his career with Manchester City in 1996. Whilst at Maine Road he was sent out on loan to Cardiff City, Blackpool, Scarborough, Northampton Town and Mansfield Town in order to gain first team experience. However, he failed to make the grade at Manchester City and so joined Mansfield Town on a permanent transfer. He became a prolific scorer for the "Stags" scoring 58 goals for the club in three seasons. This led to Division One side Stoke City signing him in August 2002. However, despite arriving with high expectations he struggled to cope with the higher level and managed just 9 goals in three seasons at the Britannia Stadium.
He left for Tranmere Rovers where he found his level and in four seasons at Tranmere Greenacre scored 53 goals. After his contract expired at Rovers he decided to join New Zealand based, A-League side Wellington Phoenix. He played three seasons for Wellington helping the club to three consecutive finals series places before retiring in 2012.
Club career.
Greenacre was born in Wakefield and at the age of 13 he signed schoolboy forms at Manchester City, having previously been on the books at Leeds United. He signed as an apprentice at 16, and turned professional in 1995. His senior debut came in February 1997 against Swindon Town, when he came on as a substitute, replacing Paul Dickov. He made three further substitute appearances that season, without scoring. During his time at Manchester City most of his first team football came in the form of loan spells with lower league clubs. In his first start for Manchester City in October 1997, he scored the winning goal in a 1–0 win against Crewe Alexandra. This was his only goal for the club, and he started only two further matches.
Greenacre subsequently went on to play on loan for Cardiff City, Blackpool and Scarborough before joining Mansfield Town in 2000. He became a prolific goalscorer at the Field Mill scoring nine goals in 1999–2000, 21 in 2000–01 and 28 in 2001–02. This attracted the attentions from bigger club's and in the summer of 2002 he joined Stoke City. His start at Stoke was however hampered by injury. Greenacre had a frustrating 2002–03 which saw him make 33 appearances scoring six goals which included a vital winner against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. In 2003–04 he found himself out of the team after the arrival of Ade Akinbiyi and made 16 appearances scoring twice. In 2004–05 he played in 34 matches but only scored once and was released at the end of the season.
He joined Tranmere Rovers in July 2005. Under the management of Brian Little, Tranmere finished 18th in League One in the 2005–06 season, but Greenacre himself finished top scorer with 18 goals in 49 games for the club. This included a hat-trick against Yeovil Town on 28 December and two goals against Oldham Athletic in August. In 2006–07 under Ronnie Moore when Greenacre again finished top scorer, this time with a total of 19 goals, and signed a two-year extension to his contract at Prenton Park. A further 14 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season saw him again finish the season as the club's top scorer. He scored his first goals for the 2008–09 season with a brace away at Peterborough in a 2–2 draw.
On 21 April 2009, it was announced that Greenacre had signed with Wellington-based, New Zealand A-League club Wellington Phoenix on a two-year contract. He made his league debut on 9 August 2009 scoring in a losing effort to the Newcastle Jets FC. Before a bothersome knee injury, Greenacre had scored five goals in 16 appearances for the Phoenix.
Greenacre started season 2010–11 by scoring twice in the opening game of the season against the Gold Coast United FC at Westpac Stadium.
Coaching career.
On 22 July 2011, Greenacre accepted a player/coaching role with his club Wellington Phoenix. Greenacre already holds a UEFA B coaching licence and will reportedly be coaching the forwards as well as playing when chosen. On 18 July 2012 he announced his retirement from the game and accepted a position as assistant manager at Wellington Phoenix.
In October 2012, Due to the absence of Ricki Herbert due to international duties, Greenacre was appointed as the caretaker manager of the Wellington Phoenix for their Round 2 clash with Melbourne Heart. Despite missing 7 first team players due to international duties, and despite playing an away clash, the Phoenix managed to obtain a 1–1 draw with the Heart, courtesy of a Paul Ifill penalty.
On 26 February 2013, Greenacre was appointed interim manager of Wellington Phoenix until the end of the season after Ricki Herbert resigned. He was replaced by Ernie Merrick for the 2013–14 A-League season.
Following Merrick's resignation on 5 December 2016, Greenacre was appointed as co-coach of the A-League side alongside Des Buckingham, originally as interim coaches, and in January 2017 confirmed for the roles until the end of the 2016-2017 season. Greenacre and Buckingham applied for the role on a permanent basis at the end of the season, but were passed over in favour of Darije Kalezic.

Canada Atlantic Railway

The Canada Atlantic Railway (CAR) was a North American railway located in Ontario, southwestern Quebec and northern Vermont. It connected Georgian Bay on Lake Huron with the northern end of Lake Champlain via Ottawa. It was formed in 1879 through a merger of two separate railway companies that John Rudolphus Booth had purchased, and reached its full extent in 1899 through a third company that he had created. The CAR was owned by Booth for several years after its completion until he agreed to sell it to the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) in 1904.
For a short time at the end of the 19th century the CAR handled up to 40% of the grain traffic from Lake Huron; this was due to a combination of factors including the advent of the grain boom on the Canadian Prairies and prior to the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway's transcontinental line across Ontario, as well as prior to the opening of the Fourth Welland Canal.
The CAR continued as a separate GTR-owned subsidiary from 1905 until 1914 when its operations were fully merged into the GTR. The GTR encountered financial difficulty during and after the First World War and was dissolved and its assets merged into the Canadian National Railways (CN) in 1923. Today remnants of the CAR continue as either active rail lines for CN or Via Rail. Some abandoned CAR rail lines have been converted into rail trails.
Route.
The CAR comprised the following lines, west to east:
History.
The CAR owes its existence to industrialist John Rudolphus Booth. J.R. Booth was an Ottawa-based lumber baron who in the latter half of the 19th century amassed timber rights approaching in central and northern Ontario. J.R. Booth was North America's largest timber-rights holder at the time and was also the owner of the world's largest lumbering operation, located at Chaudière Falls on the Ottawa River just upstream from Parliament Hill.
Booth's sawmill operations could never run at full capacity because the output could not be carried out of the lumber yards fast enough. As a result of the transportation problems he experienced in the Ottawa area, Booth became an important participant in the development of Canada's railway system when he purchased two railway companies in 1879, the Montreal and City of Ottawa Junction Railway (M&amp;OJ) and the Coteau and Province Line Railway and Bridge Company (C&amp;PL), merging them to create the Canada Atlantic Railway. The M&amp;OJ had received a charter to build southeast from Ottawa to Coteau, QC on the north bank of the St Lawrence River. The C&amp;PL had received a charter to build a bridge across the St Lawrence River to Valleyfield, QC and then across southwestern Quebec to Swanton, VT on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain. Due to financial difficulties, neither line had been completed and Booth worked through the early to mid 1880s on completing this route between Ottawa and Swanton.
In the late 1880s and throughout the 1890s Booth established a third company, the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway (OA&amp;PS) which received a charter to build northwest from Ottawa to the shores of Lake Huron at Depot Harbour, ON. All three lines met "end to end". The M&amp;OJ met the OA&amp;PS on Booth's sawmill property in Ottawa while the C&amp;PL met the M&amp;OJ in Coteau, using several hundred feet of trackage rights of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR). In 1899 Booth merged the OA&amp;PS into the CAR, retaining the name Canada Atlantic Railway.
Ottawa to Vermont.
In 1871 and 1872 a group headed by Donald Macdonald, the brother of Ontario's first premier, Sir John Sandfield Macdonald, created two railway companies which received charters to build tracks between Ottawa and northern Vermont. The promoters failed to lay any track, mainly due to the high cost of bridging the St. Lawrence River.
The Montreal and City of Ottawa Junction Railway (M&amp;OJ) would run south-east from Ottawa to Coteau-du-Lac, just west of Montreal. The line would connect to the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) at what became known as Coteau Junction, also known as Coteau station. Crossing the GTR main line, the Coteau and Province Line Railway and Bridge Company (C&amp;PL) ran southeast, bridging the St. Lawrence River to reach Valleyfield where it crossed the original Beauharnois Canal at a lock, thence across southwestern Quebec to Cantic and then crossing the northern end of Lake Champlain between Alburgh and Swanton where it ended at a connection with the Central Vermont Railway (CVR).
In 1879 Booth, with William Perley of Ottawa and J. Gregory Smith of St. Albans, Vermont, purchased the lines from the Macdonald group as part of an aggressive railway expansion plan. By this time Booth's mills were hampered by a lack of markets, and the lines would connect the mill with the US eastern seaboard markets, either for regional consumption or for export to Europe from year-round Atlantic coast ports. On 15 May 1879 the two lines were amalgamated into the newly chartered Canada Atlantic Railway.
Between July 1881 and September 1882 track was laid from Ottawa to Coteau and trains began to run regularly. Approval for a bridge across the St. Lawrence River was delayed, partly because of lobbying by competing railways and partly from fears of the effect a bridge would have on river traffic. Threatened with a lapsed charter in 1884, Booth instituted a train ferry for the C&amp;PL by early 1885 and completed the line through to Vermont using trackage rights on a small section of the GTR main line at Coteau, QC.
Bridging of the St. Lawrence River started in 1887. Work began in May 1888 and was completed in February 1890. The bridge consisted of three sections on 16 piers. The route included of track located on river islands, thus only of bridging was built. The northern section included a swing bridge elevated above the water for the river's navigation channel. A decade later, an additional structure was added on the north shore when the Soulanges Canal was built.
In Vermont the CAR connected with the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway, the Rutland Railroad, and the Central Vermont Railway. In 1897 a US connector section (the Province Line Railroad, later the Vermont and Province Line Railroad) made shipments into the United States even more efficient.
Ottawa to Lake Huron.
With the completion of the Ottawa to Vermont section, Booth began looking westward from Ottawa, not only to transport logs year-round to his Ottawa lumber mills, but also to take advantage of the increasing grain production on the prairies which was destined for eastern North American and European markets. By building through to an appropriate harbour on Georgian Bay for the receiving of Great Lake steamers, Booth could avoid the large expense of building a land-line through the rough and uninhabited terrain north of Lake Huron and Lake Superior.
In 1888 Booth incorporated the Ottawa, Arnprior and Renfrew Railway, and the Ottawa and Parry Sound Railway to build track from Ottawa to Lake Huron. Despite opposition from the Canadian Pacific and from Toronto business interests, despite fires at his large Ottawa saw mill and the deaths of his partners, Booth pushed forward with his rail line.
Even though from September 1892 to May 1893 only the Ottawa to Arnprior section had been built (, by December 1896 the line was complete through Algonquin Park to Depot Harbour on Georgian Bay, although another 16 months was needed to complete ancillary elements such as freight yards and port facilities. The first eastbound train, Depot Harbour to Ottawa, ran on 22 April 1898. In the process Booth had acquired (1892) the Parry Sound Colonization Railway which had started to build track westward from Scotia Junction towards Parry Sound.
The original plan for the western terminus of the CAR was in the vicinity of Parry Sound. However speculation in the late 1880s and early 1890s drove up the price of the necessary terminus and port lands. In 1885, after he had visited the Parry Sound area, Booth chose instead to locate the terminus on undeveloped land on nearby Parry Island, occupied by Parry Island Indian Reservation (No. 16). Under pressure from the federal Department of Indian Affairs, the local band that autumn surrendered the necessary for the rail access, terminus, port facilities and residences. A further were purchased in 1899.
The new port was named Depot Harbour and it proved to be one of the better natural harbours on the Great Lakes. Booth built both a town site and port, including waterfront freight sheds, a grain elevator, wharves, water towers, pumping stations, offices, a bunk house, hotel, over 100 company houses, a community centre, a school, and several churches. The 1901 census recorded 576 inhabitants in the village, plus 231 on the reservation.
The railway accessed Depot Harbour by crossing South Channel between Parry Island and Rose Point on the Wasauksing Swing Bridge.
Great Lakes shipping.
In 1898 Booth created the Canada Atlantic Transit Company to operate steamships on the Great Lakes from Depot Harbour to Fort William and in 1899 the Canada Atlantic Transit Company of the United States to operate between Depot Harbour and American ports such as Chicago and Duluth.
During their early years, the ships of both companies, as well as other vessels operating under charter, regularly carried goods between the upper Great Lakes and Depot Harbour. These shipping routes linked the railway across eastern Ontario, to Vermont with other railways in western Canada and the United States which terminated at ports in Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. Overall, east-bound tonnage far exceeded west-bound tonnage with a ratio of about 4:1. Booth was able to make a profit on the ships during the few years that he owned them, however, after the sale of the CAR and its shipping lines to the GTR, the profits turned to losses and shipping declined in importance.
Under the Grand Trunk Railway.
Throughout the 1890s, the Government of Canada promoted the creation of a second transcontinental railway line that could compete with the Canadian Pacific as well as American railroads. Federal politicians and bureaucrats believed that Booth's railways could form a strategic link in such a new system.
Booth himself was concerned with building the railways as well as marketing the service to build and maintain tonnage on the new lines. He was open to cooperation with other railways in eastern and western Canada, as well as to sale or amalgamation with a larger railway system. Only 4 years after the CAR was finally created, Booth was contemplating such a sale by 1901. Whether it was because Booth at age 74 was tired, or because he realized that competition from other transcontinental lines would soon cause serious problems for the CAR, he did everything possible in the early years of the 20th century to make every aspect of the railway profitable, and therefore attractive to potential buyers.
Prompted by the federal government, the Grand Trunk Railway began negotiating with Booth to acquire the Canada Atlantic as part of the Grand Trunk's efforts to expand into northern Ontario and eventually into Western Canada. In August 1904 the Grand Trunk agreed to purchase the Canada Atlantic system, including the Great Lakes steamship fleet and the line in Vermont which connected with its Central Vermont Railway subsidiary. The agreed-upon price for the entire system as well as the Depot Harbour and Ottawa terminals was CAD $16,000,000. The Grand Trunk took over all operations of the CAR on 1 October 1905; actual purchase was ratified by Parliament only in 1914.
After the purchase closed, the GTR appeared to be in no hurry to consolidate the CAR into the larger system, operating it instead as a stand-alone company for another nine years. While a Grand Trunk subsidiary, the Canada Atlantic purchased the Pembroke Southern Railway in 1906 and in 1907 the CAR created the Ottawa Terminals Railway Company; in 1912 the OTR built a large train station in downtown Ottawa near Parliament Hill and directly across Wellington Street from the GTR-owned Château Laurier hotel. This train station operated until the 1960s when it was converted into the Government Conference Centre.
The CAR was merged into the Grand Trunk on 27 May 1914 and the subsidiary company's name started to disappear as the Grand Trunk's timetables and equipment started to usurp those of the former subsidiary. Despite further Grand Trunk investments in the former CAR infrastructure, including new depot facilities, improved roadbeds and heavier track, the increased freight tonnage, passengers and income did not keep pace with the more rapidly increasing costs, so that net losses increased year by year. After the First World War, the bankrupt (or near-bankrupt) Grand Trunk Railway was finally taken over in 1923 and absorbed into the new government-owned Canadian National, which also took over ownership of the former Canada Atlantic properties.
Despite efforts by the Grand Trunk Railway to turn a profit, including the former CAR lines, it was fairly obvious not long after the 1905 purchase that this was not going to happen. The separate CAR accounts during the transition period (1905–1914) made that clear.
The Grand Trunk was the last significant railway in Canada to be nationalized by the federal government into the Canadian National (CN). During the run-up period to 1923, while it was well understood that the federal government would force the amalgamation of a number of money-losing railways, including the Canadian Northern and eventually the Grand Trunk, which would require extensive rationalization of trackage. The GTR was itself involved in pruning unnecessary routes and the former-CAR system was not immune. The GTR found it was particularly expensive to operate on the section over the height of land through Algonquin Park known as the Haliburton Highlands. This hilly area required that heavy or long freight trains had to be either "doubled" (separated and pulled in sections over the high point), or required helper locomotives. The GTR found that heavily loaded eastbound trains from Depot Harbour could be routed south around the Haliburton Highlands to eastern Ontario at less expense.
Under the Canadian National Railways.
The insolvent GTR was acquired by the federal government and merged into CN in 1923. That year, a section of the CAR main line between Two Rivers and Algonquin Park Station was abandoned.
The western section of the CAR was heavily used by CN until the Great Depression collapsed the grain trade on the lakes. When a bridge washed out in 1933 it was not replaced, and the line remained split inside the Algonquin Provincial Park. Service ran on either side of the split into the 1950s.
CN closed most of its operations at Depot Harbour on 30 May 1953. All the remaining inhabitants of the village moved out and the buildings were either demolished or left to disintegrate. The rail line remained in place and from 1959 to 1979 iron ore from Northern Ontario was loaded at Depot Harbour into freighters. The workers commuted from Parry Sound and other nearby communities.
The CAR steamship companies that had been sold along with the railway in 1905 to the Grand Trunk continued to operate under CN ownership until after World War II. The American company was voluntarily dissolved in 1948 and the charter for the Canadian company was allowed to lapse in 1950.
Current status.
Most of the CAR line west of Ottawa has been abandoned. East of Ottawa, the line is still mostly intact to Coteau and is used by CN freight trains and Via Rail passenger trains. The bridge over the St Lawrence is still intact as CN uses this for an industrial spur between Coteau and Valleyfield. The line has been abandoned east of Valleyfield to Cantic. The line is still intact between Cantic and Swanton, VT

Royal Palace of Naples

The Royal Palace of Naples () is a historic building located in Piazza del Plebiscito, in the historic center of Naples, Italy. Although the main entrance is located in this square, there are other accesses to the complex, which also includes the gardens and the Teatro di San Carlo, from the Piazza Trieste e Trento, Piazza del Municipio and Via Acton.
The palace was built from 1600 onwards by the architect Domenico Fontana as the residence of the Spanish viceroys, and in the mid-17th century Francesco Antonio Picchiatti made numerous improvements and interventions, such as the staircase and the chapel. Charles of Bourbon made it, from 1734, the main residence of the Bourbons of Naples for more than a hundred years, first as kings of Naples and Sicily (1734–1816) and later as kings of the Two Sicilies (1816–1861). It was also the residence of Joseph Bonaparte and Joachim Murat during French rule (1806–1815), under which extensive redecorations were carried out.
The Bourbons made important and constant modifications to the interiors of the palace, relying on great artists such as Francesco de Mura or Francesco Solimena. However, after the fire of 1837, the palace had to be almost completely rebuilt by Gaetano Genovese, who finished the unfinished wings and gave a homogeneous appearance to the entire complex.
After the Italian unification (1861) it passed into the hands of the Savoy, until Victor Emmanuel III ceded it to the state in 1919. From the late 19th century, the western half of the palace was opened to the public as a museum of the Royal Apartment, and in 1924 its eastern half became the home of the National Library, uses that continue today.
History.
Background.
At the end of the Aragonese domination, the Kingdom of Naples entered into the expansionist objectives of the French and the Spanish: both powers divided the territory with the signing of the Treaty of Granada (1500). In any case, the treaty was not respected and under the command of the Great Captain Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba the Spanish conquered the kingdom in 1503, thus beginning the Spanish viceroyalty. Although this period, which lasted more than two hundred years, has been considered a dark and devolutionary period, but in fact the city enjoyed a notable cultural ferment and a dynamic bourgeoisie, as well as a cutting-edge merchant fleet, capable of competing with those of Seville and Flanders.
Under the command of Pedro Álvarez de Toledo y Zúñiga, the construction of a viceregal palace was decided, designed by the architects Ferdinando Manlio and Giovanni Benincasa. The construction of the palace began in 1543 and was completed shortly afterwards. The new palace was born at a time when the viceroys dedicated their efforts to the urban reorganization of Italian cities: in Naples, the walls and forts were remodeled and the so-called "Quartieri Spagnoli" were built.
Construction (1600–1616).
When Fernando Ruiz de Castro, count of Lemos, arrived in the city as viceroy Together with his wife, Catalina de Zúñiga, he decided to build a new palace. The official argument to justify its construction was to honor Philip III of Spain by hosting him solemnly in view of an imminent visit by the monarch that, in the end, never took place. However, contemporary analysis indicates that the viceroy knew that Philip III had never intended to move his court to Naples and that the palace was actually built to satisfy the viceroy's own wishes.
The area chosen for the new construction was located at the western end of the city, on the hill of Pizzofalcone, in a position that allowed the port to be dominated and that would facilitate an escape route for the king in case of an enemy attack. There it would be next to the Viceregal Palace, using, in fact, part of its gardens, and next to the Castel Nuovo, the former royal residence, reinforcing the courtly character of the area. The choice of this location was also encouraged by the fact that the city was expanding towards the west: in this way, with such an important building in the vicinity, the price of land in the areas of Pizzofalcone and Chiaia would increase.
The project was entrusted to Domenico Fontana, considered at the time the most prestigious architect in the western world, who held the position of chief engineer of the kingdom. Fontana had fallen into disgrace a few years earlier, due to the death of Sixtus V in 1590, the pope who had commissioned him to carry out numerous works in Rome.
The first stone was laid in 1600, in the square that, in those years, bore the name of "Piazza San Luigi. "The final project for the palace was published by Fontana in 1604 under the title "Dichiarazione del Nuevo Regio Palagio." However, the original plans used by the architect to begin the work were lost and, in fact, Fontana himself lamented this:
In any case, a plan drawn by Giovanni Giacomo is preserved in Rome, probably before 1651, which shows how the palace was intended to have been according to the architect's first wishes. In any case, the original design does not seem to have differed too much from its final appearance, although undeniable modifications were made during its construction. In this design, both the main west and north facades were the same, while a C-shaped structure was supposed to have been built along the south side facing the sea. This design was so popular that, even though the palace was still under construction, the press of the time often depicted it as it was in the plans rather than as it was actually being built. Domenico Fontana was so enthusiastic about the project he had been commissioned to do that he had the following inscriptions inscribed on two columns of the façade:
However, only the main façade of this project was completed; while the south-east arm was not built and the south façade remained unfinished and disordered until it was completed in 1843.
The architectural style developed by the architect was late Renaissance, with a central courtyard and an interior loggia on the first floor, thus adapting the project to the demands of the time; that is, to a function of ostentation rather than a fortified residence. It also had a large square located right in front of the palace for military parades and public events. The works were carried out diligently both under the mandate of the Count of Lemos and under that of his son and successor Francisco Ruiz de Castro. Under Viceroy Juan Alonso Pimentel de Herrera, Count of Benavente, the works slowed down, probably due to the limited availability of resources after the wars and crises that hit Spain or even as a matter of honour: the Pimentels showed little interest in completing a work begun by the Ruiz de Castro.
In 1607, after the death of his father, Giulio Cesare Fontana took over the direction of the works. The construction of the palace continued rapidly, until in 1610 Pedro Fernández de Castro, also the son of Fernando Ruiz de Castro, was appointed viceroy. In 1616, the new headquarters of the university was built at the end of Via Toledo, that is, at the opposite end to the site on which the Royal Palace was being built. It was named Palazzo degli Studi and would be the future headquarters of the National Archaeological Museum of Naples. Thanks to some notes by Alessandro Beratta and the writings in a travel diary by Confalonieri, we have evidence of the state of the works in that year:
From this writing, it is clear that the work was almost finished at that time.
Shortly afterwards, although the exact date is not known, the interior decoration work began with the execution of the paintings by Giovanni Battista Caracciolo, Belisario Corenzio and Giovanni Balducci.
The Viceregal Period (1616–1734).
From the time the palace was completed, it was inhabited by 22 Spanish viceroys and 11 Austrian viceroys. Far from remaining unchanged, the Royal Palace continued to transform itself according to the tastes of each viceroy.
The Duke of Alba (1622–1629) was commissioned to finish some vaults begun by the Count of Lemos and dedicate them to the family glories. The Palatine Chapel was completed under the Duke of Medina de las Torres, from 1646 to 1648, with a large altarpiece by José de Ribera; in 1656 the stucco work on the vault of the interdeux of the windows was carried out, which had to be redone after 1688 due to an earthquake that collapsed the roof. They were not finished until 1705.
Under the government of Íñigo Vélez de Guevara el Mozo, Count of Oñate, the original two-ramp staircase of Fontana, judged undignified, was completely renovated by Francesco Antonio Picchiatti, following the wishes of the Count of Oñate, the works took place from 1651 to 1666. The two main rooms of the palace were also redecorated: the "Great Hall" and the "Hall of the Viceroys", which began to be adorned with portraits of the viceroys from 1503.
Exteriorly, between 1666 and 1671, when Pedro Antonio de Aragón was in power, the most notable addition took place with the construction of a small pavilion facing the sea, the so-called Belvedere, which would serve as a bedroom for the viceroys and later for the Bourbon sovereigns. Attached to it was a small garden terrace that grew over the decades to become the current "hanging gardens or Belvedere gardens".
From 18 April to 2 June 1702, Philip V visited Naples, being therefore the first and only Spanish sovereign to stay in a palace originally intended to receive Philip III. In 1707 the Austrians took the city in the midst of the War of the Spanish Succession, beginning the government of the Austrian viceroys that did not bring substantial changes to the palace.
The first Bourbons (1734–1806).
In May 1734 Charles of Bourbon entered Naples, the city became, once again, the capital of an autonomous kingdom and not a viceroyalty. The new king found the Royal Palace empty and dilapidated, since, since its construction, it had been normal for viceroys to move in with their furniture and, once their mandate had ended, to take it with them. This was done by the last Austrian viceroys, Giulio Visconti Borromeo Arese, in March 1734. All that remained in the palace were the magnificent painted vaults made by Neapolitan artists of the 17th century.
The renovation works were directed by the military engineer Giovanni Antonio Medrano, later architect of the Royal Palace of Portici, and initially focused on the king's apartments facing the Piazza della Repubblica. Although the works were completed in 1740, by 1738, the year of Charles's wedding with Maria Amalia of Saxony, they were almost ready. The palace was then structured around two main rooms or apartments:
In general, in this first reform, the works that evoked the history of Naples and its Spanish past were preserved as a sign of historical prestige, while those that referred to the Austrian period were destroyed. From 1735 to 1738, large celebratory frescoes were commissioned from Neapolitan late Baroque painters such as Francesco Solimena, Nicola Maria Rossi, Francesco de Mura and Domenico Vaccaro. For example, Rossi painted a fresco celebrating the taking of Gaeta in 1734 in the "Room where His Majesty dresses" (Room IX); Solimena painted another fresco of the king on horseback in the "Room of the Viceroys" (Room XXII), covering up an earlier one of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor; and de Mura painted another fresco of large proportions in the "Room of the Guard" (Room II) celebrating marital virtues following the royal wedding. Finally, the sovereign redecorated the interior of the palace with sumptuous marble and silk hangings.
During the reign of Charles of Bourbon, the Royal Palace of Naples was a meeting place for the French lifestyle, Spanish tradition and Italian artistic culture.
During the minority of Ferdinand IV, from 1759 to 1767, it is worth highlighting the progressive extension of the palace towards the east (towards the Castel Nuovo), with the construction, around 1760, of the eastern wing that ran parallel to the so-called "Steward's Apartment" facing the sea and the hanging gardens systematized around 1740. Following these extensions, two interior courtyards called "de "the Carriages" and "the Belvedere". There were also important decorative changes, such as the extension in 1763 of the Belvedere Wing facing the sea with the "daily bedroom of His Majesty", four private cabinets and the king's study; most of the rooms decorated with frescoes by Giuseppe Bonito. However, the most notable reform, coinciding with the end of the minority and the marriage of the King to the Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria in May 1768, was the transformation of the Spanish-era "Grand Hall" into a late-baroque court theatre by Ferdinando Fuga.
From 1780 onwards, the interest of Ferdinand IV and Maria Carolina turned to the Caserta Palace, where their apartments had been completed. From then on, the court would spend at least half the year outside Naples.
The Bonapartes (1806–1815).
The arrival of the French in 1806 and the beginning of the reigns of Joseph Bonaparte (1806–1808) and Joachim Murat (1808–1815) did not bring about major architectural changes to the royal palace, but it did bring about major interior and decorative transformations, most of which have now disappeared. The Napoleonic monarchs had to deal first of all with a general refurnishing of the palace, which Ferdinand IV had emptied when he went into exile in Palermo in 1798 and 1806. Although some interventions had already taken place under Joseph, from 1809 to 1810 the reforms were essentially functional, to convert the palace into a habitable residence. From 1810 to 1814 the major works took place, but were never completed.
In addition to a joint "grand apartment of ceremony", Joachim Murat and Caroline Bonaparte each had an "apartment of honour" and an "ordinary apartment", Murat's apartments were concentrated in the western core of the palace, while Caroline's were grouped in the eastern wing formerly intended for the royal princes (now the seat of the National Library of Naples). The Belvedere garden was the connection between the royal couple's private apartments and also a play area for their children. Among the transformations of the period, it is worth highlighting the new theatre by Caroline Murat in the eastern wing or the bedroom in the form of a military tent for Joachim in the Belvedere Wing.
The fall of the Bonapartes in 1815 prevented further transformations, such as the new throne room in the "Gallery of the Ambassadors" (now Room 8). However, two spaces were deeply marked by that period. On the one hand, the Royal Chapel, to which Joseph Bonaparte had already added the sumptuous altar of pietra dura from "Santa Maria degli Scalzi", was remodelled in Byzantine style and inaugurated in 1814; although it would be rebuilt after the fire of 1837 and destroyed during the Second World War. On the other hand, in the "Hall of the Viceroys" the gallery of portraits of these disappeared and it was transformed into an antiquarium, adding plaster copies of the sculptures of the royal collection; due to the Farnese Hercules the room began to be called "Hall of Hercules", the sculptures were also lost in 1837.
The Bourbon Restoration (1815–1837).
After the reconquest of Naples by the Bourbons, only cosmetic but highly symbolic modifications took place in the palace. In 1818, Ferdinand IV, now Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, undertook the complete redecoration of the Throne Room, resacralizing the space after the Napoleonic interlude. Antonio de Simone designed the ceiling stuccos with fourteen allegories representing the provinces, united around the throne, of the new Kingdom of the Two Sicilies created in 1816 by unifying those of Naples and Sicily. The entire room was also covered with a red velvet hanging with gilded Bourbon lilies.
At that time, the division of the palace into two poles devised under the Bonapartes was perpetuated. On the western side facing the Largo di Palazzo was the "Grand Apartment of the King", while on the eastern wing facing the Castel Nuovo was the "Reception Apartment" of the Duke of Calabria, who enjoyed the old little theatre of Caroline Murat, as well as his private rooms and accommodation for his children. During his brief reign, Francis I continued to inhabit these same apartments, and after his death, they were occupied by his widow, the queen mother María Isabella of Spain.
The Transformation by Ferdinand II (1837–1861).
On 6 February 1837, at 5 am, a fire broke out in the Queen mother's chambers in the eastern wing, destroying much of the eastern half of the palace. After the disaster, a new restoration of the entire complex became necessary. King Ferdinand II commissioned the renovation by the architect Gaetano Genovese, who carried out the work between 1837 and 1844, restoring the parts damaged by the fire, extending and finishing others, and redecorating the interiors. Genovese followed the neoclassical and historicist trends prevailing at the time, without abandoning the original architecture of Domenico Fontana, to give a homogeneous appearance to the whole complex.
During the course of the work, the eastern wing facing the Castel Nuovo was completely remodelled; the Belvedere wing was demolished; the unfinished south façade facing the sea was completed, uniting it with the existing Fontana-era façade and crowning the central section with a new belvedere of white marble; and the private apartments of Ferdinand II and Maria Theresa of Austria were moved to the second floor, leaving the former first-floor apartments for official receptions only. The surroundings of the palace also underwent major transformations. Between 1841 and 1843 the Viceregal palace was demolished, creating in its place the "Piazza San Ferdinando" (now Piazza Trieste e Trento), and Friedrich Dehnhardt created a new romantic rear garden by demolishing old stables and other buildings.
The Royal Palace was then made up of several apartments grouped around two cores. In the western one, which constitutes the original palace, were the King and Queen's Etiquette Apartment (now the Royal Apartment) and the King's Apartment on the ground floor used for private receptions (now closed).
In the eastern wing (now the National Library), made up of the extensions of the 18th and 19th centuries, were located the Apartment of the Festivals and the Apartment of the Duke of Calabria, on the first floor; and the Palatine Library, the King's Physics Office and the Private Apartment of the King and Queen on the second floor.
The decoration of the newly created spaces, as well as the renovations to some of the old ones, moved away from academic neoclassicism and adopted a more eclectic and historicist approach, close to the exuberance of Percier and Fontaine.
Few changes took place during the short reign of Francis II, who on 6 September 1860 had to abandon the palace and the city in the face of the threat of the Garibaldine troops. Before leaving, the sovereign packed some of his most precious possessions, which were sent to Capua and Gaeta, among which were Raphael's prized Pala Colonna, Titian's portrait of Alessandro Farnese, a marble bust of Pope Pius IX, the relics of Saint Jasonia, sixty-six reliquaries, a portrait of Louis XVIII, vases, porcelain, a nightstand with views of Paris on Sèvres plates, tablecloths, household linen, mattresses and cushions, twenty-six boxes containing silverware, seven déjeuners and one hundred and fifteen silver candlesticks. However, much of Queen Maria Sophie's wardrobe and the king's personal fortune deposited in the Banco di Napoli were left behind.
The Savoys (1861–1919).
After the fall of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1860 and the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, the palace became the residence of the House of Savoy. The new owner of the palace, Victor Emmanuel II, first visited the palace on 7 November 1860, just two months after Francis II of the Two Sicilies had left, and it does not seem that he ever stayed there again. The visits of the new dynasty to the city were generally sporadic. Only from 1868 to 1870, the palace served as a permanent residence for Prince Umberto and Princess Margherita, newly married in April 1868. It was in this palace that the future king Victor Emmanuel III was born on 11 November 1869. The couple left the city after the taking of Rome in September 1870.
After ascending to the throne in 1878, the new royal couple returned to Naples, but their stays were always bittersweet. In 1878 they were victims of the assassination attempt by Giovanni Passannante, in 1883 they returned to comfort the wounded in the earthquake at Casamicciola and in 1885 they returned to the victims of cholera. More fortunate was the visit in 1889, following the inauguration of the Corso Umberto I. The Prince of Piedmont, the future Victor Emmanuel III, also resided in Naples from 1891 to 1896. However, the royal family often preferred the Capodimonte palace, which was more isolated and had a larger garden.
The first decades after the Unification were also those of a slow process of emptying the palace's treasures: from 1862 to 1864 several modern paintings were moved to Capodimonte, in 1864 the Armory was moved and in 1873 the porcelain, both also to Capodimonte; In 1878 several tapestries were taken to the Quirinal Palace, in 1879 the instruments of the Physics Cabinet went to the University of Naples, before 1884 the royal carriages left for the Pitti Palace, the music archive was ceded to the Conservatory on an uncertain date and in 1921 it was the turn of the Archives of the Royal House, integrated into the State Archives of Naples.
However, it is also worth highlighting some specific interventions in the palace, such as the sumptuous neo-baroque furniture in the First Antechamber, carried out between 1862 and 1864; the coats of arms of the provinces of the new Kingdom of Italy painted in the Hall of Hercules around 1868 or the "marouflage" of the "Assumption" by Domenico Morelli made for the Royal Chapel in 1869. Another notable change was the replacement of the Bourbon fleur-de-lis by the Savoy cross in several places in the palace, including the main staircase, the court theatre and the throne itself. However, the most important and controversial intervention would be the installation, in 1888, in the niches of the main façade, of eight sculptures of the most important kings of Naples, including Victor Emmanuel II, despite the fact that he never held that title.
Likewise, the core of the palace was moved to the eastern wing, a process that had already begun with the reform of Ferdinand II. Umberto and Margherita were installed in the former apartment of Caroline Bonaparte, of duke of Calabria and then of Francis II. His son, Prince Victor Emmanuel (III), had it done just above, in the private apartments of Ferdinand II. The apartments were furnished with sumptuous new Neo-Baroque and Neo-Rococo furniture, as well as an extensive collection of contemporary paintings that Queen Margherita had been collecting.
In the old heart of the palace, the western wing, the so-called "Gala Apartment", was regularly open to the public.
Transfer to the State (1919–1940).
The greatest change in the history of the Royal Palace of Naples took place in 1919, when King Victor Emmanuel III transferred the palace, along with many other royal residences, to the state. Three years later, between 1922 and 1924, following the impulse of Benedetto Croce, the National Library of Naples was installed in the eastern wing of the palace, the one that had been occupied by the various sovereigns and their families since the mid-19th century. This installation entailed the transfer and storage of the furniture and the loss of part of the decoration to make way for the shelves of the library. Only on the west side was the "Gala Apartment", since then called the "Royal Apartment", open to the public.
In 1931, the last royals to live in the palace moved in: Crown Prince Umberto (II) and his wife Princess Maria Jose of Belgium. On 24 September 1934, their first-born daughter, Princess Maria Pia of Savoy, was born in the palace; from then on, the couple preferred the privacy of the Villa Maria Pia in Posillipo.
From World War II to the new century (1940-2000).
During the Second World War the palace suffered considerable damage. On 4 August 1943, during an Allied bombing raid, the roof of the court theatre, the chapel and the bridge in the hanging garden, among other areas, were destroyed. The palace was then used as a welfare club by Anglo-American troops from 1943 to 1945. During this period, numerous thefts of works of art took place and a large number of curtains and hangings from the Royal Apartment were destroyed. The furniture was not so unlucky, as it was moved to a safe place at the beginning of the conflict.
The restoration took place from 1950 to 1954: the paintings were recovered, in some cases repainted; The original furniture was reinstalled and the silk elements originally made in San Leucio were reconstructed using the ancient looms.
In 1994, the seat of the regional government, which had been located in the Royal Palace since the beginning of the 20th century, was permanently moved to another location. In the middle of the second decade of the 21st century the façade was restored and some areas of the Royal Apartment were renovated. among them the corte theater.
Exterior.
The main façade.
The main façade of the Royal Palace faces the Piazza del Plebiscito and was completed in 1616. It is one hundred and sixty-nine metres long and until 1843 was adjacent to that of the Viceregal Palace, which was demolished to make way for the Piazza Trieste e Trento. The façade is made of fired reddish clay bricks, piperno and volcanic stone from the Phlegraean Fields. The late Renaissance and Mannerist imprint can be seen in the superposition of several orders, typical of theatrical buildings of ancient Rome, such as the Coliseum or the Theatre of Marcellus; while the Mannerist can be appreciated in the modular design of the façade that could be repeated ad infinitum since it has no element that marks its beginning or its end, in the same way that, in the upper part, it does not find a conclusion due to the lack of a cornice. However, originally the cornice was crowned by obelisks, vases and three bell gables positioned vertically at each entrance. All of this was removed at the beginning of the 19th century, leaving only the central bell gable with the clock.
The architectural articulation follows the treatises of Vitruvius: the pilasters are arranged vertically and the three orders (at ground level we find the Tuscan order, followed by the Ionic and, finally, the Corinthian) are arranged horizontally. On the other hand, the two-tone use of materials stands out to highlight the architectural elements (in grey stone) on the walls (in reddish brick), a technique that would be very successful in Naples.
Originally, the lower part had porticos along its entire length, a very innovative decision for the time, designed by Fontana so that the people could walk around even in bad weather. However, after the Masaniello revolt and because of the structural problems of the pillars, which were being crushed, in 1753 the arches were walled up according to the project of Luigi Vanvitelli. Niches were opened in the new walls, but it was not until 1888 that statues of the main kings of Naples were placed in them, with the intention of showing a certain continuity between the House of Savoy and the previous dynasties of Neapolitan history. From left to right, we can recognize "Roger II of Sicily," a work by Emilio Franceschi; "Frederick II of Swabia," by Emanuele Caggiano; "Charles of Anjou," by Tommaso Solares; "Alfonso V of Aragon," by Aquiles De Osas; "Charles V of Habsburg," by Vincenzo Gemito; "Charles of Bourbon," by Raffaele Belliazzi; "Joachim Murat," by Giovanni Battista Amendola and "Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy," by Francesco Jerace.
In the centre of the main façade is the entrance portal, flanked by two coupled granite columns, and crowned with the coat of arms of Philip III of Spain, already planned by Fontana to emphasise the public function of the palace. Next to it, on each side, are two smaller coats of arms belonging to Juan Alonso Pimentel de Herrera and Pedro Fernández de Castro, viceroys of Naples when the palace was built. Below the balcony cornice is the coat of arms of the Savoy. There are also two plaques: one in commemoration of the start of the works by order of Fernando Ruiz de Castro and his wife Catalina de Zúñiga; and the other, with an inscription praising the beauty of the building. Below the plaques there were, until the beginning of the 18th century, two statues representing "Religion" and "Justice." The two sentry boxs on either side of the main entrance were made in the early years of the 18th century. Along the façade and in the courtyard of honour there is, between the ground floor and the first floor, a frieze with triglyphs and metopes in which are the emblems of the Hispanic Monarchy and its possessions in Europe, largely obtained after the 1559 Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis: the three-towered castle of Castile; the rampant lion of Léon; the snake devouring a captive, symbolizing the Duchy of Milan; the shield with the four vertical bars of Aragon; the cross with the four Moor's heads, symbol of the Kingdom of Sardinia; and the emblems of Navarre, Austria, Portugal, Granada and Jerusalem.
The other façades.
The longest of all, the one running south along Via Acton, was built in different phases: its eastern half at the beginning of the 17th century according to Fontana's designs and the eastern half, including the central belvedere, from 1837 to 1844 by Gaetano Genovese. The north façade facing Piazza Trieste e Trento was also by the same architect, completed between 1841 and 1843 after the demolition of the Viceregal Palace. While the architects Francesco Gavaudan and Pietro Gesuè were responsible for the connection to the San Carlo Theatre.
Both façades imitate the architectural articulation designed by Fontana for the main façade, and both are C-shaped and contain a garden in their centre, the south façade the so-called Hanging Gardens and the north the Italian Garden, in the centre of which is the statue of "Liberty", made by Francesco Liberti in 1861, a clear reference to the Italian unification. In addition, this north façade is partially porticoed to support a terrace. It has a glass entrance leading directly onto the grand staircase, decorated with two pairs of plaster statues from the Palazzo degli Studi and placed there during Genovese's restoration. These are copies of the "Farnese Hercules" and the "Farnesian Flora" on one side, and of the "Minerva" and of "Pyrrhus and Astyanax" on the other.
The courtyards.
According to Domenico Fontana's original project, three courtyards were to be opened in front of each entrance, which would be connected to each other by vaulted corridors. However, only the central entrance courtyard was ultimately built, the so-called Courtyard of honour ("Cortile D'Onore"), which is square in shape, with five arches on each side. The central arch on each side is a segmental arch of larger dimensions than the others. Around the courtyard, on the first floor, there is a loggia, originally open, but which was finally closed with large windows. In a niche in the eastern part of the courtyard there was originally a cistern, which was replaced during the 1940s by a fountain decorated with a statue of "Fortuna". The fountain, made in 1742 by Giuseppe Canart, was commissioned by Charles of Bourbon and was originally located near the port. Following an investigation, brick paving in the shape of a herringbone has been discovered in some places.
During the construction of the new southern arm of the palace between 1758 and 1760, two new courtyards were created: one on the same axis as the courtyard of honour, just behind it, which is called the Courtyard of the Carriages, while the other is the Courtyard of the Belvedere.
Despite having been built in different periods, the Courtyard of the Carriages ("Cortile delle Carrozze"), so called because it contained the coach houses, is architecturally close to the style that Domenico Fontana gave to the palace, although there are no lack of different elements such as the use of stucco instead of piperno and the angular pilasters. The courtyard is rectangular in shape, and has an elliptical marble cistern in the centre. It is connected to the courtyard of honour and the esplanade of the bastions by two service corridors with lowered arches. The coach house, built in 1832 by Giacinto Passaro, replaced the one existing from the previous century, the work of Ferdinando Sanfelice, mainly for aesthetic reasons, since the new one was aligned with the facade of the palace while the previous one was situated obliquely. The new coach house is a space dominated by a central line of nine columns of the Doric order, on which you can still admire red shields with the crown of Umberto I of Italy. The window layout was modified by Genovese in 1837 to adapt it to the requirements of the Belvedere Courtyard.
The Belvedere ("Cortile del Belvedere") was born as a boundary towards the sea of the first nucleus of the palace and was originally C-shaped. It was closed by a loggia, which would be modified as a consequence of the construction of the new bodies of the palace in the 18th century, with the insertion of lowered arches in the eastern part. Later, the courtyard underwent modifications between 1837 and 1840, when, for access to the courtyard, a triumphal arch with Ionic and Corinthian semi-columns of false piperno was created. Between the ground and first floors, the courtyard is decorated with a Doric band with metopes, also in false piperno, and triglyphs. From the Belvedere Courtyard, you can access different areas of the palace: on the left is the Guest Staircase, which leads to the Vestibule (room XX) of the Royal Apartment and to the small bridge, destroyed in the bombings of the Second World War and rebuilt on the same supports, which links it directly to the hanging gardens. From the courtyard, you can also access a private apartment with Pompeian-style decorations, originally reserved for official meetings of Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, which later became the seat of the superintendency; and also to a bridge that, overcoming the defensive ditch, led to the bastion of the Castel Nuovo and to a slope that led to the stables.
The Royal Apartments.
The Royal Apartments () are the part currently open to visitors and is located on the "piano nobile" of the western core of the palace. Throughout its history it has undergone several changes of use and name: from 1616 to 1734 it was used as the apartments of the Spanish and Austrian viceroys and their consorts; from 1734 to 1806 it was the public and private apartment of the king and queen of Naples; from 1806 to 1815 it served as the "honorary" and "ordinary" apartment of Joseph Bonaparte and Joachim Murat; It was later called the "Grand Apartment of His Majesty the King" and Ferdinand I and Ferdinand II were the last to inhabit it. After the 1837–1844 renovation by Gaetano Genovese, it was called the "Etiquette Apartment of the King and Queen" and was used only for receptions, as the sovereigns moved to the second floor of the eastern wing. In the travel guides of the beginning of the century it was simply called the "Gala Apartment", and could be visited from Thursday to Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. upon request for a permit.
When the palace ceased to be property of the Crown and passed to the State in 1919, the Royal Apartment became one of the "institutes of antiquities and art" (now called "[[Italian national museums"). Its present museum appearance is due to the restoration carried out between 1950 and 1954 to alleviate the damage suffered during the [[Second World War]], when several ceilings were damaged by Allied bombing and the silk hangings of twenty rooms were removed when the apartment was transformed into a "Welfare Club" (social club) for the occupying English troops.
Originally, to access the king's rooms, silver and gold keys were used, guarded by the [[gentlemen]] of the chamber, some of which are in the [[Museo Civico Filangieri]] donated by Neapolitan nobles.
The collections.
The current decoration represents the tastes of the different dynasties and historical figures who have lived there, as well as different political messages typical of a building that represented the pinnacle of power in the kingdom. The reference date is the inventory made by the Savoy family in 1874, which describes the rooms after the late Bourbon modifications (1837–1844) and some slight changes introduced after the Unification in 1860.
First of all, the frescoes stand out. These essentially cover the viceregal period with works by [[Belisario Corenzio]] of Roman Renaissance inspiration or [[Giovanni Battista Caracciolo]] in a more [[Caravaggisti|Caravagesque]] line; the Baroque period of Charles of Bourbon with large allegorical frescoes with [[trompe l'oeil]] by Solimena, Vaccaro or de Mura; and finally historicist and neo-medieval works from the mid-19th century.
The paintings in the rooms also correspond to different periods, highlighting the northern and European schools of the 16th and 17th centuries from the Farnesio collection inherited by Charles of Bourbon; Caravaggesque paintings and the Dutch portraits that Domenico Venuti bought for [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand I]] and the large court portraits of the royal family. There are also more intimate and contemporary paintings from the apartments in the east wing, such as "troubadour" paintings commissioned by the Murats from artists such as [[Louis Nicolas Philippe Auguste de Forbin]] or the chronicle paintings of the great moments of the reigns of Francis I and Ferdinand II by [[Salvatore Fergola]] and [[Frans Vervloet]]. However, due to the sending of the most important paintings to the [[National Archaeological Museum of Naples|Real Museo Borbonico]] between 1829 and 1832 and the transfer of paintings to the [[National Museum of Capodimonte|Capodimonte]] from 1862 onwards, the palace's collection of paintings today appears more scattered and impoverished than before, with its series and iconographies fragmented. In the 1874 inventory, the paintings were given special importance, together with the furniture, tapestries, flowered hangings and large neo-baroque mirrors, as creating a sumptuous atmosphere.
The furniture, in the [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]] and historicist style, was made by Neapolitan cabinetmakers between the 18th and 19th centuries or brought from [[First French Empire|France]] during Murat's stay in Naples, together with carpets and [[Tapestry|tapestries]], some of them woven in the Royal Tapestry Factory of Naples. Also of note are the French clocks, the porcelain, especially [[Sèvres porcelain|Sèvres]], Chinese and Russian; bronze and marble sculptures and works in hard stone. Many of the exhibits come from other parts of the palace, especially the eastern wing, which was completely stripped of furniture when the National Library was installed there.
In any case, the palace does not have a real collection, but rather loose pieces, since during the 19th century, on the initiative of the Bourbons and especially the Savoys, many works were transferred to other museums (see History).
Floor Plan.
The Royal Apartment is composed of a grand staircase, an ambulatory, a chapel, the hanging gardens and the Gallery and Hall of Hercules, in addition to the rooms that make up the King's apartment and the Queen's apartment.
[[File:Palazzo Reale Napoli Pianta Museo Appartamento.svg|right|400x400px|Pianta]]
Grand Staircase.
The north side of the courtyard, orthogonal to the façade, was originally occupied by a modest two-ramp staircase, the work of [[Domenico Fontana]]. However, after the [[Neapolitan Republic (1647)|anti-Spanish revolt of 1647]], the viceroy [[Íñigo Vélez de Guevara el Mozo|Iñigo Vélez de Guevara]] commissioned a new and monumental staircase from Francesco Antonio Picchiatti. The new space was built between 1650 and 1670 in Piperno, and was inspired by the immense staircase of the Real [[Alcázar of Toledo]], built by [[Alonso de Covarrubias]] and [[Juan de Herrera]] between 1550 and 1605. The new staircase, which occupied an entire side of the courtyard of honour, was built in accordance with the importance that the Austrian ceremony gave to these spaces. [[Montesquieu]] described it in 1729 as the most beautiful in Europe, however it had to be rebuilt after the fire in February 1837.
The new design in a grandiose late neoclassical style was the work of [[Gaetano Genovese]]. In 1841 the problem of the staircase's luminosity was resolved with the demolition of the viceregal palace annex, the creation of the Piazza Trieste e Trento and the opening of large iron-framed windows. However, it was not until 1858 that Francesco Gavaudan completed the decoration characterized by sumptuous marbles such as pink marble, the "porto venere", the red of [[Vitulano]], the "breccia rosata" of [[Sicily]], the marble of [[Mondragone]] and the "lumachino " of [[Trapani]]. For its part, the [[cloister vault]] that covers it is decorated with white stuccos on a gray background, representing garlands and the shields of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], of the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], of [[Basilicata]], of [[Calabria]] and, although it was added later, of the [[House of Savoy]]. Finally, the side walls are decorated with sculptures of the [[cardinal virtues]]: on one side, the "Fortitude" by [[Antonio Calì]] and the "Justice" by [[Gennaro Calì]]; on the other, the "Clemencia" by [[Tito Angelini]] and the "Prudencia" by Tommaso Scolari; and, flanking the central section, two [[bas-relief]]s in Carrara marble representing the "Victory between the Genius of Fame and Courage", by [[Salvatore Irdi]], and the "Glory between the symbols of Justice, War, Science, Art and Industry", by [[Francesco Liberti]].
Ambulatory.
[[File:Ambulacro_(Palazzo_Reale_di_Napoli)_001.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A corridor of the ambulatory.]]
The ambulatory on the first floor is made up of four corridors surrounding the courtyard of honour: originally it was an open loggia which, during the restoration in the 19th century, was closed off by means of large windows. At this time the vaults were decorated with stuccoes by Gaetano Genovese. The rooms of the royal apartment open off the ambulatory: in the first arm, which runs parallel to the façade towards the [[Piazza del Plebiscito]], are the court theatre and the audience chambers; in the second are the private rooms of the former private apartment, which overlook the hanging garden; in the third, facing east, are the Hall of Hercules and the royal chapel; and finally, the fourth arm leads to the grand staircase, from which one can see through a stained glass window the [[Piazza Trieste e Trento]], with a view, in the distance, of the [[Carthusian monastery of San Martino]]. This layout has been preserved unchanged, as it was designed by Domenico Fontana. The doors leading to the ambulatory are [[lacquered]] in white, are in a neoclassical style and were built in the 1930s.
The King's Apartment.
[[File:Teatrino_di_Corte_(Palazzo_Reale_di_Napoli)_001.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Court Theatre.]]
The Court Theatre (Room I) was originally the "Sala Regia" or "Sala Maggiore" and was the largest room according to Fontana's project. From the beginning it was used for balls, comedies and festivities, and from 1648 Picchiatti decorated its ceiling with sumptuous gilded stucco and paintings by order of the viceroy [[Íñigo Vélez de Guevara el Mozo|Count of Oñate]]. This renovation ran parallel to the creation of another large ceremonial room in the palace, the "Sala de los Virreyes" (now the Hall of Hercules). During the reign of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles of Bourbon]] it was regularly used for theatrical performances and a large stage was set up on it. Its current appearance, however, dates back to 1768, when on the occasion of the wedding of [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]] and [[Maria Carolina of Austria]] it was completely remade by [[Ferdinando Fuga]] in a classicist baroque style.
After the serious damage suffered during the Second World War, the stage and the ceiling had to be rebuilt between 1950 and 1954, with frescoes painted by [[Francesco Galante]], [[Alberto Chiancone]], [[Vincenzo Ciardo]] and [[Antonio Bresciani]]. These authors took up in their paintings the themes of the original frescoes by [[Antonio Dominici]] and [[Crescenzio La Gamba]]. In the niches there are the original cartapesta statues made by [[Angelo Viva]], representing "[[Minerva]]", "[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]", "[[Apollo]]" and the nine "[[Muses]]s".
[[File:Sala_II_(Palazzo_Reale_di_Napoli)_001.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The First Antechamber (room II).]]
[[File:Prima Anticamera Palazzo Reale Napoli, 1900, I palazzi e le ville che non sono più del re.png|thumb|250px|right|The First Antechamber with all its neo-baroque decoration before the ravages (Room II)]]
The First Antechamber (room II) served as the "Room of the Guard Corps" during the time of Charles of Bourbon, while during the time of the Savoy it was called the "Dining Room of the Diplomatic Corps". The most notable feature of the Carolingian period is the fresco, painted between 1737 and 1738, in commemoration of the wedding between the monarch and [[Maria Amalia of Saxony]]. Painted in a [[cloister vault]], it was the work of [[Francesco de Mura]], while the [[trompe l'oeil]] were by Vincenzo Re. It represents the "Royal Genius and the virtues of the King and Queen" (these are "Fortitude", "Justice", "Clemency" and "Magnimity" for the sovereign, and "Loyalty", "Prudence", "Courage" and "Beauty" for the queen). Also painted was "[[Imeneo]], goddess of weddings, crushing Evil. "On all four sides is the "Allegory of the Four Parts of the World", in monochrome, on a gold background. On an easel is displayed a fragment of the early baroque decoration of the vault, dating from 1622 to 1629 and depicting the exploits of [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba]]. The doors, painted with tempera on a gold background, are attributed to the workshop of Antonio Dominici and were made between 1774 and 1776.
The entire decoration of the room was completely redone in neo-Baroque style in 1862 by [[Pietro Cheloni]], being the first space redecorated in the Savoy period. Along with the large consoles and mirrors, two large [[Gobelin]] tapestries were also placed, a gift from the [[Apostolic Nunciature to Naples]] in 1719 and dedicated to the [[Louis XIV|Sun King]], represented through the "Allegory of the Elements." However, during the Allied occupation this room was used as a performance hall for the English troops. so several decorative elements were lost, such as the parquet, the sumptuous frames of the tapestries, the wall sconces or the rocaille overdoors with medallions. The furniture is now completed by stools dating back to 1815.
The Neoclassical Room (room III), so called because of its [[Neoclassicism|decorative style]], was designed by [[Gaetano Genovese]]. On its walls are paintings such as the "Staircase of the Royal Palace with the exit of the Bourbon princesses after the wedding", by Antonio Dominici, and the "Royal Chapel of Naples with the wedding of Maria Theresa and [[Princess Luisa of Naples and Sicily|Maria Luisa]] of Bourbon with [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II of Habsburg]] and [[Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand III of Lorraine]]", an event that took place on 12 August 1790. There are also several tempera paintings on paper, made by [[Anton Hartinger]] and [[Franz Xaver Petter]], which belonged to [[María Isabella of Spain]]. In a niche of the [[exedra]] there is a marble statue by Giovanni De Crescenzo dating from 1841 and representing a "Winged Nymph".
[[File:Napoli - Palazzo Reale2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Second Antechamber (room IV).]]
The Second Antechamber (room IV) was in the time of Charles of Bourbon the "Antechamber of the Officers". It preserves a ceiling from the viceregal period and mannerist style that represents the glorious episodes of the reign of [[Alfonso V of Aragon]],

Padrenda

Padrenda is a municipality in the province of Ourense, in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain. It belongs to the comarca of Terra de Celanova. As of 2016, the municipality has a population of 1,893; distributed in 99 different hamlets, and 7 parishes; the density is 33 inhabitants/km2.
Geography.
The territory is a very rugged relief, descending in elevation from the south to the north. Pena Rubia mountain, in the Leboreiro mountain range along the border with Portugal, reaches 1227 metres. From there to the river Miño, following the valleys of its tributary rivers Deva, Barxas, and Gorgua, the lands descend to 100 metres elevation.
The landscape is generally mountainous in the south, with river valleys in the north along Miño and its tributaries. The mountainous territory include the southern and eastern areas of the municipality, with elevations of 1227 metres, as in Pena Rubia, that has a very smooth topography, very affected by erosion. The flattening territory, in the center and east, (where the villages of Gorgua, Monterredondo, and Padrenda are located), is a parallel step next to the previous one. Here several streams meet and create the origin of two rivers, Barxas and Gorgua, which form valleys under the limit of 600 metres, which belong to the lower flattening territory (Crespos), that, together with the area of valleys (Condado, Desteriz, Padrenda), descends to 200m in Pontebarxas.

Keith O'Neill (footballer)

Keith O'Neill (born 16 February 1976) is a former professional footballer who represented the Republic of Ireland. He played as a left-sided midfielder, but could sometimes play as a striker. Despite being an exceptionally talented youngster, his career was ultimately cut short by successive injuries caused by a degenerative bone disease.
Career.
O'Neill began his playing career with Dublin side Tolka Rovers at the age of 6 before transferring to Home Farm.
As a promising youngster, O'Neill was spotted by several sides, including Norwich City, who went on to sign him when he was 18. O'Neill immediately impressed at the Norfolk club, despite being injury prone. The injury problems, some of them stemming him having suffered from spondylosis as a child, affected him virtually from the start of his career and ultimately curtailed his progress.
O'Neill went on to play for Middlesbrough and Coventry City. While at Coventry, he was diagnosed with two degenerative bone conditions in his spine, spondylolisthesis and spondylosis, which was essentially a double fracture of part of the cord that threatened to leave him disabled. These conditions eventually forced his retirement.
International career.
O'Neill made 13 appearances for his country, scoring four goals, including scoring twice against Bolivia at Giants Stadium in 1996.

Alvear, Corrientes

Alvear is a town in Corrientes Province, Argentina. It is the capital of the General Alvear Department. It is located at the mouth of the Aguapey River, along the Uruguay River, which separates it from the Brazilian city of Itaqui, with which is closely related. It is accessed via the RN 14 or the General Urquiza railway. It is located roughly 800 km north of Buenos Aires, 250 km south of Posadas and 440 km from Corrientes. According to the 2001 population census conducted by INDEC its population was 7917 inhabitants.
Etymology.
The town was officially founded in 1863, in the shadow of the "Ombú Protector", a tree that is immortalized in the community coat of arms. The name is believed to derive from General Carlos de Alvear, who was born in the province of Corrientes and was honored by the members of Congress by naming the fledgling town Alvear after him. It is also said that Don Diego de Alvear, father of Carlos María, lived some years in the Itaqui pass, and that this also contributed to the imposition of the name.
Notable institutions.
Also of note are the four schools of samba, 'Pilmayken, Yasí Berá, Halcones For Ever and Itá Berá.'

Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)

The Royal Commission on the Constitution, also referred to as the Kilbrandon Commission (initially the Crowther Commission) or Kilbrandon Report, was a long-running royal commission set up by Harold Wilson's Labour government to examine the structures of the constitution of the United Kingdom and the British Islands and the government of its constituent countries, and to consider whether any changes should be made to those structures. It was started under Lord Crowther on 15 April 1969, Lord Kilbrandon took over in 1972, and it finally reported on 31 October 1973.
Various models of devolution, federalism and confederalism were considered, as well as the prospect of the division of the UK into separate sovereign states. Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man were dealt with separately from the core issue of Scotland and Wales.
A total of 16 volumes of evidence and 10 research papers were published between 1969 and 1973. The final report was delivered to Edward Heath's Conservative Government, which had come to power at the general election in June 1970. The report rejected the options of independence or federalism, in favour of devolved, directly elected Scottish and Welsh assemblies. Two members of the commission, Lord Crowther-Hunt and Professor Alan Peacock, did not sign the report, disagreeing with the interpretation of the terms of reference and the conclusions. Their views were published in a separate Memorandum of Dissent.
Background.
The royal commission was set up in response to growing demands for home rule or full independence for Wales and Scotland, which came into public focus after the ground-breaking by-election wins of Plaid Cymru's Gwynfor Evans at the 1966 Carmarthen by-election, and the Scottish National Party's Winnie Ewing in Hamilton in 1967.
Terms of reference.
The commission's terms of reference were:
Membership.
Chairmen:
Members:
Proposals.
The commission was unable to reach unanimous agreement, with the final report including a number of options supported by different members. Two commissioners did not sign the report, producing instead a "memorandum of dissent".
Scotland.
Eight members favoured a devolved legislature for Scotland. Executive power would be exercised by ministers appointed by the Crown from members of a directly elected assembly. Areas of responsibility to be transferred to the devolved body would be some of those already under the supervision of the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Lord Advocate. These included:
Responsibility for agriculture, fisheries and food would be divided between the Assembly and the United Kingdom government, while the latter would retain control of electricity supply.
With the establishment of the devolved government, it was proposed that the number of MPs elected to Westminster from Scottish constituencies would be reduced from 71 to about 51.
The assembly was to be a single chamber body of about 100 members, elected under the single transferable vote system of proportional representation, with multi-member constituencies. The Commission did not propose to give the assembly a name, feeling this was a matter for the Scottish people, although the term "convention" had been suggested. The determination of the number of seats and boundaries was to be reserved to the United Kingdom parliament.
The new constitutional arrangements would not require the appointment of a governor, while the title "Scottish Premier" was suggested for the head of the executive.
The office of Secretary of State for Scotland would be abolished, although a cabinet minister would continue to have special responsibility in representing Scotland as well as having other duties.
Wales.
Six commissioners favoured legislative devolution for Wales. This would be similar to the scheme envisaged for Scotland, but with less responsibility in legal affairs, reflecting that Scotland had a discrete legal system separate from England and Wales.
As in Scotland, a 100-member unicameral assembly was proposed, elected by proportional representation. A title suggested to the commission for the body was "Senate". Similarly, the head of the executive might be titled "Welsh Premier", and the office of Secretary of State for Wales would be abolished. The number of Westminster MPs elected by Welsh constituencies would be reduced from 36 to about 31.
England.
The signatories to the main report were unanimous in their opposition of legislative devolution to England as a whole, or to any English region. There were however proposals for some powers being devolved to regional level:
In each case the regions to be used were to be those already established for economic planning, with boundaries adjusted to reflect the changes made by the Local Government Act 1972, although names were not suggested:
Cornwall.
The Commission recognised that "a very small minority" in Cornwall existed that claimed a separate national identity for the Cornish people, and who wished to have separate arrangements for their government. They however felt that "despite its individual character and strong sense of regional identity, there is no evidence that its people have a wish to see it separated for the purposes of government from the rest of England". However they recognised that "the people of Cornwall regard their part of the United Kingdom as not just another English county" and accordingly they recommended that the designation "Duchy of Cornwall" be used on all appropriate occasions to emphasise the "special relationship and the territorial integrity of Cornwall".
Northern Ireland.
The Commission did not make any recommendations on devolution in Northern Ireland, for which the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 had made provision. However, the report did recommend that the number of Westminster MPs from the province be increased in line with the rest of the UK, from 12 to about 17.
Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
The Commission did not propose to make any changes in the relationship between the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. They rejected a suggestion that responsibilities for external affairs be divided between the UK and island governments, but supported a Home Office proposal that a more formal process of consultation be carried out in future over the application of international agreements in the islands.
Memorandum of dissent.
Lord Crowther-Hunt and Professor Peacock did not sign the report, producing a separate series of proposals in a minority memorandum. The main differences between the document and the main report were:
Regional assemblies.
There would be seven elected regional assemblies, one for Scotland, one for Wales and five regional assemblies in England. They would have considerably greater powers than proposed in the majority report, taking over much of the machinery of central government within their area, and each having their own civil service. They would also replace ad-hoc authorities such as regional health authorities and water authorities, which were due to be introduced in reorganisation of the National Health Service and water industry. They would also have supervisory powers over gas and electricity boards. They would also be able to make policy through strategic plans for the physical, social and economic development of their regions.
A Minister for the Regions would hold a cabinet seat.
Commons reform.
The memorandum also suggested changes in the function of the House of Commons. Members of parliament were to form "functional committees" corresponding to central government departments. Each committee was to have a supporting staff and would consider the implications of both United Kingdom and European legislation, as well as having policy-making powers. To reflect their greater responsibilities, MPs would be paid full-time professional salaries.
Political reaction.
There was mixed reaction to the commission's report:
Consequences.
Following a change of government at the February 1974 election, the new Labour administration published a white paper "" based on the final report in September 1974. The white paper led directly to the unsuccessful Scotland and Wales Bill, which was withdrawn in February 1977. Two separate pieces of legislation were passed in the following year: the Scotland Act 1978 and the Wales Act 1978. The provisions of the Acts would not come into force unless approved by referendums, and accordingly Scottish and Welsh devolution referendums were held on 1 March 1979. The Welsh assembly was rejected by a majority of voters, while Scottish devolution was supported by 51.6% of those voting, or 32.9% of those on the electoral register. An amendment to the Scotland Act, introduced by government backbencher George Cunningham, had specified that it must have the support of 40% of the entire electorate, and the referendum was lost. The results of the referendums led to the repeal of the respective Acts in March 1979. A vote of no confidence was subsequently lost by the government on 28 March when the Scottish National Party voted with the Conservatives, Liberals and Ulster Unionist Party, leading to the general election of 1979 and the beginning of 18 years of Conservative rule.
Scottish and Welsh devolution was finally implemented under the next Labour government, elected in 1997, by the Scotland Act 1998 and the Government of Wales Act 1998.

Scotland national under-19 football team

The Scotland national under-19 football team is the national football team representing Scotland for players of 19 years of age or under at the start of a European Under-19 Football Championship campaign. The team, which is controlled by the Scottish Football Association, acts as a feeder team to the Scotland national football team.
History.
Until 2001, the European youth championship was competed for by under-18 teams. The best performance by a Scotland under-18 team was in 1982, when they won the tournament. Beating Czechoslovakia 3–1 in the final, the team was then managed by Andy Roxburgh and Walter Smith, who would both go on to manage the senior side. Scotland defeated rivals England in the qualifying round and finished top of Group 4, which also included the Netherlands. In the semi-finals, Scotland beat Poland 2–0. Scotland also reached the semi-finals of the 1978 tournament, where they lost on penalties to Yugoslavia. Scotland topped Group two – which included Germany and Italy – to qualify for the semi-final, having beaten Denmark in the qualifying round.
During the period of the under-19 format, Scotland qualified for the finals tournament in 2006 when, under the guidance of manager Archie Gemmill and coach Tommy Wilson, they lost 2–1 to Spain in the final. This performance guaranteed Scotland's participation at the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup (formerly the World Youth Championships), representing their first appearance for 20 years.
Since 2006, Scotland have not progressed past the elite qualification round of the European under-19 tournaments.

Medibank

Medibank is an Australian private health insurance provider headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria. It is Australia's largest private health insurance provider, covering around 4.2 million customers in 2024. Medibank initially started as an Australian Government not-for-profit insurer in 1976, before becoming for-profit in 2009 under the Rudd Government and privatised by the Abbott government in 2014. Medibank now operates as a publicly listed company on the Australian Securities Exchange.
History.
Medibank began as an Australian Government private health insurance scheme, established by the Whitlam government in 1975 through the Health Insurance Commission. In its original form, it was a universal health insurance programme funded through taxation, that also ensured free treatment at public hospitals and provided subsidies to private hospitals. The subsequent Fraser government reduced the subsidies and allowed the Health Insurance Commission (later Medibank Private) to enter the private health insurance market. Its purpose was to provide competition to private "for-profit" health funds and to put pressure on other health funds to keep premiums at a reasonable level. The original Medibank scheme became Medicare under the Hawke government, with Medibank Private continuing and now referred to as just Medibank. 
In 2006, the Howard Coalition government announced that Medibank would be sold in a public float if it won the 2007 election. However, they were defeated by the Australian Labor Party under Kevin Rudd, which had already pledged that Medibank would remain in government ownership. After 2009, although continuing in government ownership, Medibank operated as a government business enterprise, operating as a fully commercialised business, paying tax and dividends under the same regulatory regime as do other registered private health funds. Before the 2010 election, Liberal leader Tony Abbott made the same pledge to privatise Medibank if it won government, but the party was again defeated by Labor. Again, privatisation was Liberal party policy at the 2013 election, which the Coalition won.
In March 2010, Medibank withdrew benefits for restricted services on its basic First Choice Savers hospital policy. As of June 2010, benefits for procedures such as heart operations and assisted reproductive services will be available only to customers on more comprehensive policies, costing as much as 50% more. Medibank stated that the changes were intended to improve customer understanding of their products. They further stated the impact on customers will be small due to the low rate of use of the restricted services.
In late March 2016, after 14 years as CEO, George Savvides retired earlier than expected. Former NAB chief financial officer Craig Drummond was offered the role and commenced in July 2016. Following Craig Drummond’s retirement, David Koczkar was appointed CEO in May 2021.
"Not for profit" to "for profit" health fund.
Medibank was previously run as a not for profit organisation and later operated as a for-profit government business enterprise with dividends paid to the Federal Government. In May 2009, the Rudd government announced that Medibank would become a "for profit" business and would pay tax on its earnings. The process of converting the status of the business was completed on 1 October 2009 following approval from the then regulator, the Private Health Insurance Administration Council (PHIAC), an independent statutory authority which regulated the Australian private health insurance industry until 2014. Private health insurance policy is now developed by the Department of Health.
Medibank privatisation.
On 26 March 2014, Abbott government Minister for Finance Mathias Cormann announced that Medibank would be sold through an initial public offering (IPO) in the 20142015 financial year.
With the Medibank Private IPO priced at $2.15, the government exceeded the indicative range of $1.55 to $2.00 disclosed in the prospectus. However, it ensured that retail investors only pay $2.00, locking in a minimum 7% gain for them in the short-term. The sale raised $5.7 billion for the government. The sale was completed with 100% of the company sold, listing on the Australian Stock Exchange under the code MPL on 25 November 2014, with 440,000 individual owners with a market capitalisation of A$5.921 billion. Medibank held a 29% share of the private health insurance market.
2022 cyberattack.
On 12 October 2022, Medibank CEO David Koczkar reported it had detected "unusual activity consistent with the precursors to a ransomware event" in their network but initially provided reassurance that no sensitive customer data has been accessed. In response to the attack, Medibank took their AHM and international student policy management systems offline and requested a trading halt on the ASX. Medibank later announced that a group of alleged hackers have made contact with the company to "negotiate", claiming to have stolen 200 gigabytes of customer data, while providing a sample of 100 customer policies including: "names, addresses, dates of birth, Medicare numbers, phone numbers, and medical claims data including information about diagnosis, procedures and location of medical services". Other information such as credit card security data have also been claimed to have been stolen, yet this remains unverified.
On 23 October, Medibank announced that it had received a further 1,000 records from the hacker that contained policy records from the Medibank, ahm and international student databases, with Koczkar stating that they are "operating under the assumption that there is a potential that all customers could be impacted". This widened the previous assumption that only ahm and international student customers were affected, with the potential that all 3.9 million customer records were exposed.
In November 2022, the hacker group, allegedly linked with Russian ransomware group REvil, released Medibank customer data on a dark web blog, after the company reportedly refused to pay the US$9.7m ransom, with reports by 1 December suggesting that the hacker group has released all compromised files remaining in their possession.
Acquisitions and mergers.
In January 2009, Medibank acquired the Wollongong-based insurer ahm (Australian Health Management) and merged with the HSA Group in April 2009. Following these transactions, Medibank created the Health Solutions Division, which is focused on delivering occupational health services (such as employment medical examinations and injury treatment) and health coaching programs to help Australians manage health conditions (e.g. diabetes). Services are delivered under the Medibank Health Solutions brands.
In July 2010, Medibank acquired health services provider, McKesson Asia-Pacific, absorbing it into Medibank Health Solutions. The telephone and online health management programs services provided by McKesson Asia-Pacific, including "healthdirect Australia", "Nurse-on-Call", and "Healthline", will be maintained by Medibank.
Industry structure and main competitors.
Private health insurance in Australia is heavily regulated to protect consumers. Prudential supervision is undertaken by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to ensure health funds remain solvent. APRA also publishes extensive statistics on the industry and annual financial statement for individual health funds to provide full transparency for stakeholders. The pricing and features of health insurance products is regulated by the Department of Health.
To inform consumers, the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman operates a website to explain private health insurance and provide a standardised basis to compare health fund products.

Halley's Comet (video game)

Halley's Comet is an arcade video game created by Pacific Manufacturing Ltd and manufactured by its parent company Taito. Receiving a worldwide release in 1986, "Halley's Comet" is a vertically scrolling shooter where the player defends various planets around the Solar System from a direct collision with Halley's Comet and the various alien swarms which accompany it.
Gameplay.
A player who controls an armed space fighter must overcome waves of enemies, intercept a huge oncoming comet that is descending to destroy a planet in which player is assigned to protect, then infiltrate the inside of a comet to destroy it from within.
The game opens with the player above Earth with the message "Defend the Earth from comets!". The player ship must navigate two stages per planet in the solar system (including Pluto, as the game was released well before the re-classification of Pluto in 2006). As enemy waves spawn at the player, all surviving enemy ships, and in rare cases, shots, will proceed past the player down a mini-map on the right-hand side of the screen and impact the planet. Each impact causes a 1% increase to the planet's damage. If the planet hits 100%, the game is over, regardless of the remaining stock of player lives. Damages done to planets stays as they are and there is no way to reduce them; only increasing damages by survived enemies. Thus letting enemies escape is not acceptable in this game.
The first stage of each planet is divided by a mini-boss fight. This encounter is a large ship that fires large bullets in clusters at the player while standard enemy waves continue to spawn. The second half of the first stage ends with an encounter with the oncoming "comet" which will share the same colour as the planet being defended (blue for Earth, yellow for Venus, Red for Mars, and so on). The comet boss will open a small section of its exterior, revealing a small patch of circuitry from which a bullet will spawn. When the player destroys 5 such openings, the comet will explode and allow the player ship to enter the comet, starting stage two for that planet.
Stage two for each planet encounter takes place inside the comet, which areveals to be an alien ship. Enemy waves continue to spawn until the player reaches the main boss for that planet. A large computer with 10 orange targets that will alternate between covered and uncovered, fires a bullet for each active target when opened. While all these battles go on both inside and outside of a comet, the comet slowly but surely continues to descend towards a stage's planet. If left unhindered, the comet will ultimately collide with and destroy the planet, resulting game over regardless of the remaining stock of player lives. The player must hurry destroying computers hidden inside comets while negotiating waves upon waves of enemy minions.
When the player destroys each of the targets, the boss explodes, and the planet is saved. The screen then changes to a bonus point calculation where points are awarded based inversely on the amount of damage the planet has taken during the level.
Development and release.
"Halley's Comet" was designed by "Bubble Bobble" creator Fukio "MTJ" Mitsuji. The music was scored by Hisayoshi Ogura. Mitsuji recounted its development process in a 1988 interview with Japanese magazine "Beep", stating that the project originated from a conversation the staff had with the then-president of Taito about creating a title based on Halley's Comet. Mitsuji regarded the game to be important for him, as it started his development philosophy based on "thrills and pleasures". Mitsuji remarked that the PCB used for the title was underpowered and had no hardware-scrolling support, prompting the team to work with effort under severe limitations on making the background look as if it was scrolling.
"Halley's Comet" was first released by Taito in Japan in January 1986 and later by Coin-it in North America on April of the same year. The game was later ported to Japanese mobile phone platforms such as i-mode and Yahoo Mobile under the title "Halley Wars" between January 15, 2003 and January 16, 2004 respectively. Between 2007 and 2008, the title was also included as part of volume 2 in the "Taito Memories II Gekan" and "Taito Memories II: Eternal Hits" compilations for PlayStation 2. In 2021, it was re-released for PlayStation Network and Nintendo eShop by Hamster Corporation as part of their "Arcade Archives" series.
Reception.
In Japan, "Game Machine" listed "Halley's Comet" on their March 15, 1986 issue as being the second most-popular arcade game at the time. In North America, "Play Meter" listed the game to be the eight most-popular arcade game at the time, but the Japanese book "Revived 20th Century Arcade Game Encyclopedia Vol. 2" gave the title a negative review. Cave programmer Hiroyuki Uchida stated in a 1998 interview that its gameplay served as a basis for "Dangun Feveron". Likewise, former Toaplan composer Tatsuya Uemura claimed in a 2009 interview that "Twin Cobra" was influenced by "Halley's Comet", as he wanted to portray the feeling of aiming and shooting.
Legacy.
A sequel, "Halley Wars" is a vertically scrolling shooter released on the Family Computer Disk System in 1991 and later on the Game Gear.

Sitina Tunnel

The Sitina Tunnel (alternatives "Sitiny Tunnel" or "Františka Tunnel") is a motorway tunnel in Bratislava, Slovakia on the D2 motorway at the "Lamačská cesta - Staré grunty" section. The tunnel goes under the Little Carpathians forest. It is the first two-tube tunnel in Slovakia and by its opening, the entire D2 motorway in Slovakia was completed.
Preparation and facts.
The preparation works for both the tunnel and the motorway section began in the 1990s. The route had to be chosen; there were 3 variants:
After studying all the 3 variants, the variant with a shorter tunnel was selected, mainly for environmental reasons. The tunnel from that variant is 1440 m long for the western (right) tube, and 1415 m for the eastern (left) tube. The covered parts near the building of the Slovak Academy of Sciences are 206 m and 216 m long, respectively. The width of the road is 7.5 m, and features 1 m wide hard shoulders. The average gradient in the tunnel is 2.34%. The maximum allowed speed will be 80 kilometres per hour (50 mph). The tunnels were built using New Austrian Tunnelling method (NATM).
Due to construction near built-up areas, several changes had to be made:
The planned costs of the tunnel and of the entire section are 3.5 billions SKK (app. €98.75 mill.), but the final costs have risen to 4.5 billions SKK. 18% of that are paid from the state budget and the rest from a loan provided by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).
Construction.
In May 2003, construction works began at the motorway section, and in October 2003, works were launched at the tunnel itself by driving from the southeastern portal. In summer 2004, driving began from the northwestern portal as well. Driving was a bit slower than expected due to damaged geological zones, in which stronger lining had to be made. The breakthrough for the western tube was made on February 8, 2005 and for the eastern tube on May 3, 2005. The construction works were finished in December 2005 and technological works followed. The technology testing took place in the first half of year 2007. The tunnel was opened for traffic on 24 June 2007, with a ceremonial opening taking place on 23 June 2007, which included a ride through the tunnel by Formula One car, driven by David Coulthard.

Indiplon

Indiplon (INN and USAN) is a unmarketed nonbenzodiazepine, hypnotic sedative that was developed in two formulations—an immediate-release formulation for sleep onset, and a modified-release (also called controlled-release or extended-release) version for sleep maintenance.
Pharmacology.
Pharmacodynamics.
Indiplon works by enhancing the action of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, like most other nonbenzodiazepine sedatives. It primarily binds to benzodiazepine sites on α1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors in the brain.
Pharmacokinetics.
Indiplon has a short elimination half-life of 1.5 to 1.8 hours in young and elderly subjects, respectively.
Chemistry.
Indiplon is a pyrazolopyramidine related to the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic zaleplon.
History.
Indiplon was discovered at Lederle Laboratories (which was later acquired by Wyeth) in the 1980s and was called CL 285,489. In 1998 Lederle licensed it, along with other early stage drug candidates, to DOV Pharmaceutical, a startup formed by former Lederle employees, and Dov exclusively sublicensed its rights in the drug to Neurocrine Biosciences in that same year. In 2002, Neurocrine entered into an agreement with Pfizer to develop the drug.
Indiplon was originally scheduled for release in 2007, when Sanofi-Aventis' popular hypnotic zolpidem lost its patent rights in the United States and thus became available as a much less expensive generic. In 2002, Neurocrine Biosciences had entered into an agreement with Pfizer to co-market indiplon in the US, in a deal worth a potential $400mn. However, following the issuing of a non-approvable letter for the modified-release 15 mg formulation and an approvable letter with stipulations for the 5 mg and 10 mg immediate-release version by the FDA in May 2006, Pfizer ended its relationship with Neurocrine. Neurocrine's stock price dropped 60% on the news.
Following a resubmission, the FDA in December 2007 deemed Neurocrine's new drug application (NDA) 'approvable' in the 5 and 10 mg formulations, but requested new studies as a prerequisite to approval, including a clinical trial in the elderly, a safety study comparing adverse effects to those of similarly marketed drugs, and a preclinical study examining indiplon's safety in the third trimester of pregnancy. 
Following the 2007 FDA letter, Neurocrine decided to discontinue all clinical and marketing development of Indiplon in the United States.

Françoise Claustre

Françoise Claustre (8 February 1937 – 3 September 2006), was a French archaeologist.
Life and career.
Claustre was taken hostage by a group of Chadian rebels, led by Hissène Habré, on 20 April 1974, at Bardaï, in the Tibesti Mountains of northern Chad. At the same time, the rebels also seized a German doctor, Christophe Staewen, and Marc Combe, who was an assistant of Claustre's husband, Pierre.
Marc Combe managed to escape and Staewan was released on 11 June 1974, after a ransom had been paid by the West German government.
Military officer Pierre Galopin was sent to negotiate with the rebels on behalf of the French and Chadian Governments, but he was captured by them in August 1974, and executed in April 1975 after the French government refused to exchange him for arms.
Claustre's husband, a senior French development worker, was away on business when the attack on Bardaï took place. He lobbied strongly to get his wife released, and also attempted to intervene himself, but was captured by the rebels in August 1975. Habré then threatened to kill the Claustres unless a large ransom was paid. A sum of 10 million French Francs was paid by the French government, but this was insufficient to secure the release of the hostages.
France then resorted to diplomacy, seeking support from the Libyan leader, Muammar al-Gaddafi. Gaddafi's intervention led to the release of Pierre and Françoise Claustre, in Tripoli, on 1 February 1977.
After her release, Claustre returned to working as an archaeologist in France. In an interview with "Paris Match," she said that she wanted to return to anonymity. In 1990, her story was made into a film by Raymond Depardon, "La Captive du désert", starring Sandrine Bonnaire. Depardon had also visited the rebels and interviewed Claustre during her captivity. The resulting broadcast had generated considerable public interest, encouraging the subsequent action by the French government.
Claustre, who was born in Paris, died at her home in Montauriol, Pyrénées-Orientales, France, in September 2006, at the age of 69.

Embedded SQL

Embedded SQL is a method of combining the computing power of a programming language and the database manipulation capabilities of SQL. Embedded SQL statements are SQL statements written inline with the program source code, of the host language. The embedded SQL statements are parsed by an embedded SQL preprocessor and replaced by host-language calls to a code library. The output from the preprocessor is then compiled by the host compiler. This allows programmers to embed SQL statements in programs written in any number of languages such as , COBOL and Fortran. This differs from SQL-derived programming languages that don't go through discrete preprocessors, such as PL/SQL and T-SQL.
The SQL standards committee defined the embedded SQL standard in two steps: a formalism called Module Language was defined, then the embedded SQL standard was derived from Module Language. The SQL standard defines embedding of SQL as "embedded SQL" and the language in which SQL queries are embedded is referred to as the "host language". A popular host language is C. Host language C and embedded SQL, for example, is called Pro*C in Oracle and Sybase database management systems, ESQL/C in Informix, and ECPG in the PostgreSQL database management system.
SQL may also be embedded in languages like PHP etc.
The SQL standard is available through purchase and contains chapter 21 Embedded SQL and its syntax rules.
Database systems that support embedded SQL.
IBM Db2.
IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows supports embedded SQL for C, C++, Java, COBOL, FORTRAN and REXX although support for FORTRAN and REXX has been deprecated.
Mimer SQL.
Mimer SQL for Linux, macOS, OpenVMS and Windows support embedded SQL.

SAP Sybase ASE 15.7 supports embedded SQL for C and COBOL as part of the Software Developer Kit Sybase.
SAP Sybase SQL Anywhere supports embedded SQL for C and C++ as part of the SQL Anywhere database management system SQL Anywhere.
SAP Sybase IQ supports embedded SQL for C and C++ as part of the Sybase IQ database management system Sybase IQ.

Rona (1892)

Rona was a sailing yacht designed by George Lennox Watson. She was constructed in 1892 in Auckland, New Zealand, by master craftsman and designer Robert Logan Snr. for Wellington merchant and book collector Alexander Turnbull, and is the oldest continuously registered ship in New Zealand. 
The boat was sailed from Auckland to Wellington, leaving Auckland 14 February 1893 and Arrived Wellington Harbour on the 21 February 1893. An article in the "Wellington Evening Post" on the 22 February 1893 recounted its maiden voyage.
The boat is one of the finest surviving examples of a six-beam cutter (her beam fits into her length six times; i.e., she has very slim lines), she is a gaff-rigged racing cutter, and she is one of the oldest yachts still sailing in New Zealand.
"Rona" is an example of 19th-century racing yacht design and construction. The boat was originally painted black, the colour used on New Zealand's America's Cup yachts.
"Rona" was restored to original condition by her last private owner, John Palmer, which took over nine years. That "Rona" was able to be maintained as a fully operational sailing vessel for over 110 years is due to her construction in kauri pine ("Agathis australis"), a fine-grained timber of excellent quality for boatbuilding.
The Rona Preservation Trust was set up to purchase "Rona". This was accomplished in November 2006, with the assistance of grants from the Lotteries Foundation others, and the boat was made accessible to the community through sailing events, maintenance and training days and public open days.
In May 2023 the yacht was transported to Peter Brookes Yard near Waimauku, Auckland for the next chapter. Andrew Barnes, Larry Paul and Peter were instrumental in making this happen.
She needs much remedial work. Garboards need to come off, deck beams, beam shelves, deck and gunnels need replacing.
A Give-a-little page is available to help raise the funds necessary to restore her. The end goal is to get her racing in Auckland harbour alongside other contemporary gaff yachts like Gloriana and Rogue.

Jay Hughes

James H. "Jay" Hughes (January 22, 1874 – June 2, 1924) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher who played four seasons from to .
Career.
Hughes was born in Sacramento, California, in 1874. He attracted attention in 1897 when he threw a three-hit shutout during a west coast exhibition game against the famed Baltimore Orioles, a team featuring such notable baseball stars as Wilbert Robinson, John McGraw, Hughie Jennings, Willie Keeler, and Joe Kelley. Orioles manager Ned Hanlon hired him and brought him east, where he played four seasons.
Hughes started his National League (NL) career with two consecutive shutouts, a feat that would not be achieved again by an NL rookie until Al Worthington did so for the New York Giants in 1953. Hughes pitched a no-hitter on April 22, 1898 (another no-hitter, by Cincinnati's Ted Breitenstein, was thrown the same day, marking the first time that two no-hitters were thrown on the same day). Hughes was transferred to the Brooklyn Superbas in ; the Orioles and Superbas were both owned by the same group of individuals. Jennings, Keeler, and several other key Orioles were transferred, including manager Hanlon, who had an ownership stake. Hughes won a league-leading 28 games for the 1899 Superbas.
Preferring to play on the west coast, Hughes joined the Pacific Coast League in . As a Sacramento native, he disliked pitching in the east, and on several occasions refused to sign contracts with eastern clubs so he could remain on the west coast. In 1903, playing for the Seattle Rainiers, he tied Doc Newton for the lead in wins with 34, including 12 in a row from September 8 through November 4. Hughes pitched there until a back injury ended his career.
Hughes died in 1924 when he fell from a train in Sacramento, fracturing his skull. He was laid to rest at St. Joseph Cemetery in Sacramento.

Parish Church of St Helier

The Parish Church of St Helier is the parish church of the parish of Saint Helier, Jersey. It is a Church of England church, one of the twelve 'Ancient Parish Churches' of Jersey, and serves as the Island's civic church and Pro-Cathedral.
History.
Dedication.
Helier was a Belgian saint who lived as a hermit for some ten years on an islet in St Aubin's Bay, about three-quarters of a mile off the south coast of Jersey. In AD 555 he was martyred by Saxon pirates, beheaded by their leader who feared his men would be converted by Helier's preaching. In consequence Helier soon came to be venerated by the Islanders, and eventually was adopted as the Patron Saint of both Jersey and its capital.
Establishment of the parish church.
Although the church is some way inland today, this is a result of land reclamation, and it once lay on the shore – indeed, the church used to have iron rings set into the wall to tie up boats. The site of the church would have been the closest accessible location on dry land to the site of Helier's martyrdom. It is believed that a chapel was erected on the site of the present building very shortly after Helier's death, but the present church was begun in the 11th century. The earliest record is in a document regarding the payment of tithes signed by Duke William II of Normandy, which – because William signed himself Duke rather than King – is assumed to pre-date the Norman Conquest of 1066. All that is visible of the 11th century structure are the remains of window arches on either side of the Choir. The building was reconsecrated in 1341 for unknown reasons.
Development of the building.
The church building was extended to roughly its present size by the end of the 12th century, but most of that building is also lost. The sections of wall flanking the East Window, part of a pier on the north east side of the crossing, the west face of the North Door and the adjoining section to the west, and a small section of wall opposite are all that remain of the building period of roughly 1175 to 1200. The porch attached to the North Door and the greater part of the nave and crossing were built in the second quarter of the 15th century. The date of the chancel is now more or less impossible to determine, since the original walls have been obliterated by the North Chapel on the one side (built in the last quarter of the 13th century, originally the Mortuary Chapel) and the South Chapel (last quarter of the 15th century, commonly but erroneously known as the Lady Chapel) on the other. Most of the north transept dates to the second quarter of the 13th century. The present south transept, vestry, and the westwards extension to the nave (now converted into a narthex) all post-date c. 1820, and are largely Victorian. A major renovation and re-ordering of the church began in 2007, and will take several years.
Changes in the ordering of the church.
Until 1548 the interior of the building would have resembled the interior of any medieval church, with a rood screen separating the chancel from the nave (projections to support the screen can still be seen on the piers either side of the nave on the west side of the crossing). It is not known if there were ever wall paintings, but successive generations of plaster and whitewash over the last five centuries will have long concealed any which may have existed. In 1548 Edward VI ordered the destruction of all aspects of ‘Popish Superstition’ within the churches of his realm. The Jerseymen, strongly influenced by Huguenot immigrants fleeing persecution in France, carried out the King's orders with zeal, and all altars, fonts, holy water stoups and piscinas were removed, the rood screen was dismantled, the stained glass smashed and all but one bell was taken from the tower. A huge triple-decker pulpit was erected in the crossing and pews were arranged around it. Seven galleries were built, including one reserved for smokers. In spite of the return of Anglican worship in the 17th century, the church continued in this state until the 1860s, by which time it had fallen into considerable disrepair. A major project of restoration was undertaken to repair and re-order the building after the conventions of the Church of England. The pulpit was replaced by a much more modest affair at the north west corner of the crossing, the galleries were broken up, the pews were taken out and replaced by a new set facing the restored altar at the east end. The original font, left in the churchyard, was given to Grouville Parish Church and a new font installed. An extension was made to the west end of the Nave, and a new gallery was installed there and in the south transept. New choir stalls were erected in the chancel. In 1930 these were replaced by another new set as a memorial to Charles George Renouf, a Jurat of the Royal Court (the stalls they replaced were given to St Andrew's Church). At the same time the level of the Chancel floor was raised. The South Chapel was re-ordered in 1952 as a memorial to Matthew le Marinel, Rector of St Helier and Dean of Jersey during the German Occupation (1940–45), and again in 2004 to make it more ‘user-friendly’. In 1997 a glass screen was erected to separate the nave extension from the rest of the church to create a Welcome area, new glass doors were installed at the west end and the font was moved from the west end to its original position by the North Door.
The organ.
The organ, considered the finest in the Channel Islands, was built in 1926 by Jardine and Co. of Manchester, and restored and enlarged in 1962 by the John Compton Organ Co. A small ‘Positive’ section was added in 1972 by Messrs. William Hill and Son, and Norman and Beard Ltd. The organ was completely renovated in 1985. In early 2008 it was dismantled as part of the renovation of the church, and temporarily replaced by a purpose built electronic organ.
The renovation and rebuilding of the organ was entrusted to The Village Workshop Company. Because the organ chamber was identified as an ancient mortuary chapel of historic importance during the renovation, the organ was reinstated to the South Gallery in late 2013, which is thought to have been its original home, with a small choir and positive section on the north side of the Chancel. With three manuals, in total, the organ has 2,063 pipes.
The specification includes a trompette-en-chamade department, which is housed in the west gallery of the church. The trompette-en-chamade is a fanfare trumpet stop, which not only has a stunning visual impact but also supplies a highly effective solo stop which speaks with amazing clarity and prominence. 
The splendid new casework and display pipes feature stained and polished wood to enhance the woodwork within the church, whilst the display pipes and the pipes of the trompette-en-chamade have been created by Kevin Rutterford of the Village Workshop in polished zinc, and lacquered to prevent tarnishing and staining. To ensure the depth and richness of tone within the confines of the gallery, the 32’ stops use state of the art digital technology, and the console is now situated on a mobile platform, giving flexibility and providing a great visual spectacle for concerts and recitals. The latest transmission and piston systems give thirty departmental and thirty general memory levels.
The inaugural recital after the renovation was complete, was given by Ian Tracey from Liverpool Cathedral, on 26 September 2014.
Additional buildings.
A chapel, ‘’La Chapelle de la Madeleine’’, existed in the north west corner of the churchyard until the Reformation. Formerly the Rectory and church offices existed in the churchyard, also on the north side. These were replaced in 1969 by a new Church House building, a large concrete edifice of controversial design incorporating offices (most of which are rented out), a church hall, kitchens and a choir vestry, together with a flat (now used by the church verger/caretaker). The Rectory was moved to a large, purpose built Georgian house in the early 19th century.
Historical events of note.
A gun battery was erected in the churchyard in 1643 by the pro-Parliamentarian militia besieging Elizabeth Castle, and return fire from the castle struck the tower (the dents in the granite wall can still be seen); it is believed that this accounts for the lack of a steeple, which is assumed to have been destroyed by gunfire at this time. In 1646 Charles, Prince of Wales, and his brother James, Duke of York (the future Kings Charles II of England and James II of England respectively) took refuge in Jersey during the English Civil War and attended services at the church. Unusually for the time the service was conducted in English, though the (Calvinist) services usually held there were normally conducted in French. Indeed, in 1663 a French translation of the Book of Common Prayer was authorised by Charles II for use by Anglicans in the Island. In 1651, after Jersey was captured by Parliamentarian forces, the church was used initially as a barracks by the victors, and then as a garrison church. 
The parish guns for the militia were kept in a store on the site of the present Narthex, and were taken for their own use by invading French forces in 1781 during the Battle of Jersey. The two opposing commanders of the battle, Major Peirson and Baron de Rullecourt – who were both killed during the action – are buried within the boundaries of the church, Peirson under the Chancel (there is a memorial in the Crossing, and a later, rather more elaborate one in the South Chapel) and de Rullecourt in the churchyard, his grave marked by a simple stone. The precise location of Peirson's grave has been controversial, as the Victorian renovations involved the complete alteration of the supposed burial site; consequently it has long been suspected that the stone marking Peirson's grave is in the wrong place. However, in April 2008 archaeological investigations revealed a late 18th-century brick vault containing a single coffin. A flag and a victor's wreath had been placed on the lid, suggesting the burial of a military hero, proving beyond reasonable doubt that the stone did indeed mark Peirson's grave.
During the German Occupation, the occupying forces used the building as a garrison church, although they timed their services so as to allow the regular congregation to continue their normal services. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother attended a service in thanksgiving for the end of the Occupation in 1945, and presented the church with a crucifix and pair of candlesticks for the altar.
The church today.
Today the church holds two services on a Sunday, together with a short Communion service on several Tuesdays a month, which cater for a local population (largely drawn from outside the parish, since most of the residential areas of St Helier are served by several district churches), and in the summer especially numerous visitors, situated as it is within easy walking distance of several hotels. However, it is also used for various other services: in addition to weddings and funerals, its location next door to the States of Jersey building and the Royal Court makes it the scene of civic services such as that following the Assize d’Heritage, a ceremony marking the start of the legal year, and the service following the annual session of the Ecclesiastical Court in which churchwardens and other church officers are sworn in at the Royal Court. It is also the location of the services related to the swearing in of new Lieutenant Governors. As a Pro-Cathedral, it is the seat of the Bishop of Winchester in the Channel Islands, and the church possesses a crosier for his use.
In the last century, and intermittently in earlier years, the Rector of St Helier has also held the post of Dean of Jersey, head of the Anglican Church in the Island and representative for religious affairs in the States Assembly. It is also the venue for numerous concerts, both by its own choir and organist, and by visiting performers.
The ownership and maintenance of the fabric of the church is the responsibility of the municipality, and the Rector and his Churchwardens serve on various administrative committees in the municipality. The start of a major and costly programme of restoration work prompted calls at the 2006 Rates Assembly for this system to be overturned on the grounds that it was not fair that non-churchgoers should have to pay (via their parish rates) for the upkeep of the building. This plan has received little support, however, with opponents of the change – including both churchgoers and non-churchgoers – pointing out the value of the church as a historic site, its role as a community focus and venue for the Arts, and the complications that would result from a ‘user pays’ system of public service funding.
The church is one of Jersey's listed buildings.
Music.
The church has a longstanding tradition of music, and currently has two choirs: The Town Church Choir, which is a mixed robed adult choir, which sings regular weekly Parish Eucharist at the 11:00am Sunday service and one Choral Evensong service each month; and the Town Church Choristers, a robed children's choir of boys and girls aged from 7 to 18, currently around 20 strong, which sings Parish Eucharist once each month at the 11:00am Sunday service, as well as for civic and ceremonial services in the Church. There is also a worship group which sings regularly at the 9:30am contemporary Sunday service.
Rectors and Curates of St Helier.
As with all the Ancient Parish Churches, the priest with responsibility for the Parish Church of St Helier has always been a Rector. He is responsible for the conduct of services, but has no official authority in the administration of the church's affairs, these being the responsibility of the two Churchwardens, who are elected, along with other church officers, by the Parish's Ecclesiastical Assembly. In the past few years the Bishop of Winchester, intending to cut down on the number of Anglican clergy in the Island, suspended all vacant Rectories. Outgoing Rectors were replaced by a Priest in Charge, or "Ministre Desservant", who lacked the freehold of the Parish and were thus easier to remove. This suspension has now been lifted, however.

George Bodington

George Bodington (1799–1882) was a British general practitioner and pulmonary specialist.
Career.
Born in Buckinghamshire and educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, he served a surgical apprenticeship then studied at St Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1825 he was licensed by the Society of Apothecaries, and became a physician and GP in Erdington (then in Warwickshire, now West Midlands).
His great professional interest was pulmonary disease and in 1836 he acquired the asylum and sanitorium at Driffold House, Maney, Sutton Coldfield.
In 1840 he published his essay, "On the Treatment and Cure of Pulmonary Consumption", condemning contemporary treatments and advocating instead dry frosty air, gentle exercise, and a healthy diet. This was attacked by reviewers in the Lancet and he became disenheartened with his work.
He later turned to the treatment of insanity. In 1851 the local census recorded eleven "lunatics" and six staff, including the doctor and his family, at Driffold House.
At some point the asylum was moved to the White House, Maney, which was demolished in 1935 to provide a site for an Odeon cinema (now part of the Empire Cinemas group). In 1881 the Doctor was living at Manor Hill where his two daughters ran a girls boarding school. The census of that year shows nine pupils of which five were nieces.
He was also a local politician and served on the Sutton Corporation for forty years (having as usual being appointed for life).
He was the paternal grandfather of barrister Oliver Bodington and the great-grandfather of Nicholas Bodington.

Strzelecki railway line

The Strzelecki railway line was a steam-era branch railway line in Victoria, Australia. The line opened in June 1922, branching off the former "Great Southern Railway" (South Gippsland line) at Koo Wee Rup Station. The main line branched off the current Pakenham line at Dandenong, extending out into the South Gippsland region.
Construction.
The line was constructed with 'D' steel rail, using sleepers long, wide and deep, with nine sleepers being used for every , or 20 sleepers per length of rail, laid on a ballast of sand deep. Track speed for passenger and freight services was .
Opening and description.
The Strzelecki line opened on 29 June 1922, serving the farms of the Strzelecki Ranges. Sheep and/or cattle loading facilities were provided at all stations except Heath Hill, with goods loading and storage facilities at all stations except Athlone. 
Two years after the line opened, two goods sidings, situated between Koo Wee Rup and Bayles, were provided: Plowrights siding and Water Washed Sand siding. Narrow-gauge tramlines ran from both sidings to the main Koo Wee Rup drain, and were used for transporting river-washed sand to the main line. Both Plowrights and Water Washed Sand sidings closed in 1931.
Bayles was the first station on the line, situated in light scrub just south of the township. The following station was Catani, now just a mound of earth where the platform was. Yannathan platform was 11.5 km from Koo Wee Rup, and Heath Hill was a further 2.4 km along the line. Athlone Quarry Siding, 94.14 km from Melbourne, was opened with the line, but closed three years later. Athlone station was 2.4 km further along the line, followed by Topiram.
Triholm, 106.6 km from Melbourne, became the terminus of the line after the section beyond was closed on 22 November 1930. Beyond Triholm, the line featured steep grades and sharp curves.
The original terminus station at Strezlecki had a 53-foot turntable. After Strzelecki station's closure, no other station on the line was supplied with a turntable, requiring trains to run tender-first in the down direction and returning to Koo Wee Rup engine-first.
Closures.
The Strzelecki line turned out to be one of the shorter-lived lines in Victoria. The section between Triholm to Strzelecki closed due to a trestle bridge developing a large sway every time a train ran over it, with the cost of repairs deemed uneconomical in view of the light traffic. The section of track from Yannathan to Triholm was closed on 7 August 1941, after flooding of the Lang Lang River resulted in damage to one of the four trestle bridges over the river. Next to close was the section from Bayles to Yannathan, on 15 April 1950. The line to Bayles was kept open until 4 February 1959 to serve a butter factory.

<doc id="7002547" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7002547" title="War on Terror (game)">
War on Terror (game)

War on Terror, The Boardgame is a satirical, strategic board game, produced and published in 2006 by TerrorBull Games. "War on Terror" was originally conceived in 2003 by Andy Tompkins and Andrew Sheerin, two friends based in Cambridge, England. The initial inspiration for the game came from the imminent Invasion of Iraq but, as a whole, was intended as a commentary of the wider War on Terror. In 2005, Sheerin and Tompkins founded TerrorBull Games and gathered enough financial support from a mixture of friends and acquaintances to put "War on Terror" into production.
Widespread notoriety has meant the game has had a colourful and, at times, troubled history. Its initial release was met with a barrage of criticism, particularly from the tabloid press. Other businesses refused to be associated with the game and it was also banned from a number of industry fairs around the world. The British police even confiscated a single copy. More recently, however, opinion has turned around and "War on Terror" is now praised by various highly respected institutions and individuals, among them Amnesty International and John Pilger.
The gameplay has been likened to a cross between "Risk", "Diplomacy", "Monopoly" and "Settlers of Catan". Like a number of war board games, the basic goal is to dominate the entire world (or "liberate" in the parlance of the game itself). However, the scope of "War on Terror" stretches to cover all aspects of war-time politics, not just battlefield tactics. The creators of "War on Terror" have correspondingly claimed it is the most realistic war simulation board game around.
Concept.
"War on Terror, The Boardgame" can be described as a "Risk"-like war board game inspired by modern-day geopolitics. In terms of board game style, it is a mixture of both European and American approaches – utilising elements of chance and chaos as well as strategy and player interactions.
Starting with a tiny presence on the map, each player takes on the role of a budding empire, intent on "liberating" (dominating) countries and continents, controlling oil production and building cities to win the game. An empire controls a region when it has a development there: a village, a town or a city. To expand, an empire can build developments at the border of its current empire if the regions there are unoccupied. Much of the time this will involve some fighting. There are two primary ways to interfere with other empires: fighting wars against them or funding terrorist units in the hope of making them attack your opponent. The game play is essentially card-driven – including the aforementioned warring and terrorist attack. Players obtain two such cards every turn. Additional cards can also be bought using money, which is obtained from oil. Oil is randomly spread out across the map and varies from game to game. An important issue is that when terrorists are no longer dormant and leave the training camp, they act outside the control of the empire which initially funded them, and can turn on that empire if triggered by an opposing empire or the terrorist player. An in-game twist is that defeated players are not out of the game – they become the "terrorist" players, and can still influence the result and perhaps even win. It is also possible to join the terrorist side voluntarily. An important aspect of the game centres around diplomacy and off-board negotiations and dealings. A 'secret message pad' is provided to this end and sees heavy use in a typical game.
An iconic part of the game is the "Axis of Evil": a spinner in the centre of the board which determines which player is "evil" – that player must then wear the Evil balaclava and gets two terrorist cards per turn. Other empires also have a financial incentive to fight wars against the evil empire.
The "Evil Balaclava" itself has developed a life outside of and independent of the game – something the designers encourage with the Gallery of Evil.
Digital.
On 25 November 2011, despite previously claiming the task was impossible, TerrorBull Games released their first video game, an iOS version of "War on Terror" on the Apple iTunes Store. There was initial speculation that it might get banned, but as of May 2014 the game was still available. However, as of June 2020 the game is now unavailable.
Reception.
Business.
Several major game and toy fairs, as well as several retailers, refused to stock this product. The justification in all cases is some variation on the claim that the topic is highly inflammatory and may be offensive to some.
Police.
In August 2008, a copy of the game was seized by the British Kent Police because the balaclava included in the box "could be used to conceal someone's identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act".
Media.
"The IT Crowd".
"War on Terror" formed part of Roy and Moss's office set dressing since series 2 of the British sitcom "The IT Crowd" (on top of the shelves behind Moss's desk). Roy and Moss are seen playing the game briefly in series 2. The show's creator, Graham Linehan, is a keen gamer and an open supporter of "War on Terror".
"Games Britannia".
In December 2009, TerrorBull Games were featured on the BBC series "Games Britannia", presented by historian Benjamin Woolley. Woolley paid especial attention to "War on Terror", noting that while it continued a certain historical tradition – going back to ancient times – of games that attempt to interpret the world around them, "War on Terror" was different in using satire to examine its chosen themes.
Politics.
Before the game was even released, it had created enough of a stir to warrant a response from the members of the British Parliament. The Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire, Andrew Lansley, commented, "this board game is in very bad taste and it appears as though somebody has gone too far". Jim Paice, Conservative MP for South East Cambridgeshire, meanwhile claimed he "[didn't] like the sound of it".
Art.
"War on Terror" formed part of the 'Embedded Art' exhibition at the Berlin Academy of Arts in January 2009. The exhibition looked at the effects of wartime and security on art. The creators of "War on Terror" and the illustrator were invited to the gallery to take part in a live, interactive game during the gallery's annual open night.
Education.
"War on Terror" is used by some educators around the world as a tool for broaching and examining the often complex issues contained within. "War on Terror" has been used in the following disciplines: geography, geopolitics, international relations and politics.
Amnesty International has stocked "War on Terror" in their catalogue under the banner of 'educational' for two years, while publications like the "New Internationalist" and "The Guardian" have emphasised the game's educational potential.
Journalist and documentary maker John Pilger has also shown his support and enthusiasm for the game, labeling it "extraordinary".
During 2010, the publishers of "War on Terror" started speaking publicly in higher education circles about the game and the role that games have to play in politics and activism; this appears to be an area in which they are gaining increasing recognition.
In February 2011, "War on Terror" appeared on its first major syllabus. The game formed part of a core module in "Political Simulation and Gaming" run by Richard Barbrook, at the University of Westminster.
In 2020, "War on Terror" was put on display at IWM North as a part of the contemporary conflict collection.

Geno Adamia

Geno Adamia (; 8 March 1936 – 28 September 1993) was a Georgian military commander who was killed during the war in Abkhazia, Georgia.
A native of Senaki, he engaged, immediately after the outbreak of the hostilities in 1992, in the struggle with the Abkhaz separatists who fought for the secession of Georgia's autonomous republic of Abkhazia, where the Georgians constituted 45.7% of the population. Adamia organized a large volunteer detachment of the citizens of Sukhumi and was actively involved in the defence of the city against the combined Abkhaz-North Caucasian forces aided by the Russian navy and aviation. He was soon promoted to Major General and appointed the commander of the 23rd Mechanized Brigade of the Ministry of Defence of Georgia. One of the most energetic and popular Georgian commanders, he refused to surrender when Sukhumi fell on 27 September 1993. With a tiny force, he continued to fight in the vicinities of Sukhumi and trying to organize a counterattack on the seized Sukhumi, he was killed in the action at the Kelasuri Bridge on 28 September. 
Adamia's friends ransomed his body which was buried in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, in November 1993. The Georgian society, especially the IDPs from Abkhazia, marked the 70th anniversary of his birth on 8 March 2006. On 27 September 2020, he was awarded the Order of the National Hero of Georgia.

TW Telecom

TW Telecom (styled tw telecom), was a business telecommunications company headquartered in Littleton, Colorado, United States. The company provided business voice services, transport, Internet, data services and wholesale fiber capacity. It was an early leader in the deployment of Ethernet for metropolitan areas, dubbed Metro Ethernet. The company was acquired by Level 3 Communications on November 1, 2014. Exactly three years later, CenturyLink (now Lumen Technologies) acquired Level 3 Communications.
History.
Founded in 1993 as Time Warner Communications, the company was a joint venture between US West and Time Warner Cable, a division of Time Warner Entertainment, to deliver data and telecommunication services over a hybrid fiber and coaxial network. The company was successful in their efforts, but at the time the cost to build fiber directly to consumer's homes proved too expensive to be profitable. In the mid-1990s the company evolved into a "carriers carrier" selling "dark fiber" capacity to other telecom and Internet providers to supplement their networks.
The company played a role in growth of the Internet as it built and assembled a national fiber network. Management realized that to continue to grow it needed to offer communication solutions alongside its wholesale network offerings.
In July 1998, Time Warner Communications became a separate entity and was reorganized into Time Warner Telecom LLC. In May 1999, the company made an initial public offering. In 1997, the company began delivering communications services to medium and large business customers, carriers and governmental entities. In March 2003, the company introduced Metro Ethernet services, an expansion of the Ethernet model of building-wide communications networks. The metro capability basically expanded the use of Ethernet across a city or region allowing for seamless connectivity of locations that were on the network of connected Ethernet rings. This capability enabled the company to offer advanced Internet, data and voice services.
In July 2006, Time Warner Telecom acquired Xspedius Communications for $531.5 million, adding additional metropolitan markets. TW Telecom had operations in 75 markets across the U.S..
Name Change.
On July 1, 2008, the company was renamed TW Telecom. The company had used the name Time Warner Telecom under an agreement with Time Warner Inc., its former parent company. The name was changed when Time Warner Inc. declined to renew the agreement allowing the use of its name. The company had considered several names, but elected to use the initials "tw" to help maintain its brand legacy in the marketplace.
Acquisition.
On June 16, 2014, the company agreed to be acquired by Level 3 Communications Inc. for $5.7 billion in cash and stock.

Western Distributor (Sydney)

Western Distributor is a grade-separated motorway that is primarily elevated for the majority of its route on the western fringe of the Sydney central business district. It links the southern end of Bradfield Highway at the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Victoria Road in Rozelle, at its western terminus near White Bay. It is a constituent part of the A4 route.
Route.
It is an unusual motorway as, citybound, it heads east, southeast after the Anzac Bridge, east, north then northeast. The freeway distributes traffic arriving from the north (a function which gives the road its name) while collecting traffic from the CBD, distributing it through Pyrmont and Ultimo before crossing over the Anzac Bridge. In the citybound direction, traffic is collected from Victoria Road and the City West Link, as well as various on ramps in the Pyrmont and Ultimo areas. Traffic is distributed into the CBD through various off ramps in Pyrmont and the western edge of the CBD, as well as into the Cross City Tunnel. The remaining traffic is fed into Bradfield Highway, as it is not possible for northbound traffic to exit onto Cahill Expressway (traffic travelling east on Western Distributor wishing to reach the eastern edge of the CBD and beyond must either travel through the Cross City Tunnel or negotiate the packed streets of the CBD).
Construction of the Rozelle Interchange as part of Stage 3 of WestConnex is underway. With its completion in 2023, it will provide a freeway-standard route free of traffic lights from Sydney's CBD to its outer western suburbs and the Blue Mountains.
History.
Western Distributor came to be out of the realisation in the early 1960s that the existing roads that supported the Harbour Bridge would not cope with contemporary and projected traffic volumes. Due to existing infrastructure and buildings in the area, it was decided to build a viaduct to carry traffic above the city streets. Western Distributor was opened in stages starting in September 1972, with the last stage being the Anzac Bridge which was opened in December 1995. The distributor also replaces the former congested route out of the city via the Pyrmont Bridge (closed in 1981) and the Glebe Island Bridge (closed in 1995 with the opening of Anzac Bridge).
The north-eastbound viaduct ramps leading towards Bradfield Highway, designed in 1967, was widened from to accommodate a deck with a variable width from and consists of a steel structure supported on reinforced concrete corbels.
The passing of the "Main Roads Act of 1924" through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW). With the subsequent passing of the "Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929" to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, the Department of Main Roads (having succeeded the MRB in 1932) re-aligned the eastern end of Main Road 165 from its old route from Pyrmont, to the southern toll plaza of the Sydney Harbour Bridge at Millers Point to the interchange with Pyrmont Bridge Road and Bank Street in Pyrmont (and continuing west across Bank Street and Glebe Island Bridge to Rozelle and along Victoria Road to Parramatta) on 22 January 1993, later amended to use the Anzac Bridge instead on 28 February 2003. Despite its role as a grade-separated motorway, the road is not officially gazetted as one by Transport for NSW classification, and is still considered today to be a main road.
The passing of the "Roads Act of 1993" updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Western Distributor retains its declaration as part of Main Road 165.
Western Distributor was signed State Route 40 in 1981, and followed the route's re-alignment when Anzac Bridge opened in 1995. Its eastern half was also declared part of National Route 1, when it was re-aligned from its old route through the CBD along York and Clarence Streets to its new route along Western Distributor to Harris Street (and continuing south along Harris Street to meet Princes Highway at Chippendale) in 1986, and removed when the Sydney Harbour Tunnel opened in 1992. It was quickly replaced in 1993 by Metroad 2 along the same alignment (and continuing south along Harris and Wattle Streets to terminate at Ultimo) until the Lane Cove Tunnel opened in 2007 and Metroad 2 was truncated to meet Gore Hill Freeway in Lane Cove. The whole route was also designated part of Metroad 4 when its eastern end was re-aligned on the opening of City West Link in 2000. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, State Route 40 was removed and Metroad 4 was replaced by route A4.
Western end.
When it was built, it was described as the southern end of the F3 Freeway, as that was where the North West Freeway was intended to finish, however due to protests from inner city residents, this plan never came to fruition. Western Distributor ends west of the Anzac Bridge western ramp and east of the junction between Victoria Road and City West Link, with traffic fed onto either of these roads.
Abandoned section.
Under the Western Distributor viaduct ramps at its northern end, between Sussex and Kent streets, there is an abandoned carriageway underneath the main roadway. It is a short section of elevated freeway; the top tier remains in constant use but the lower is suspended in the air; having been severed at each end.
In popular culture.
The road is referenced in the song "Hay Plain" by Australian artist Julia Jacklin.

The original station, now converted into a 3 bedroom house, and miniature railway was put up for sale in late 2006. It is located near Jumbunna, Victoria.
Outtrim North.
Outtrim North was a railway station on the Outtrim railway line in South Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. The station opened with the Jumbunna to Outtrim extension on 5 February 1896, and was one of only three on the Outtrim branch. The station was closed on 4 September 1951.
Outtrim.
Outtrim was the terminus station on the Outtrim railway line in Victoria, Australia. It closed in 1951 along with Outtrim North. The first sod of soil turned in the construction of the Outtrim railway line was on 6 March 1885. The line was completed by 1896. It was located in Outtrim, Victoria.

In 1979 Juhani Wahlsten invited two coaches, Wendy King and Evelyn Watson, from Dollard-des-Ormeaux, a suburb of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to teach girls of various ages how to play ringette. The Ringette Association of Turku was established in 1981 and several Canadian coaches went there to initiate the training and help establish the sport. The ski national week then organized an annual tournament to bring together all the ringette teams.
Internationally Canada and Finland have always been the most active ambassadors in the International Ringette Federation. Canada and Finland regularly travel across various countries to demonstrate how ringette is played.

Mantinada

Mantinada (Greek: μαντινάδα), plural "mantinades" (μαντινάδες) is the art of musical declamation (recitative) in form of a narrative or dialogue, sung in the rhythm of accompanying music. It is prominent in several parts of Greece, especially on the island of Crete where mantinades are performed in accompaniment of the Cretan lyra and Cretan laouto (a stringed instrument resembling lute).
The word is derived from Venetian "matinada", meaning "morning song".
They typically consist of Cretan rhyming couplets, often improvised during dance music. The rhymed Cretan poetry of the Renaissance, especially the verse epic "Erotokritos", is reminiscent of the mantinada, and couplets from "Erotokritos" have been used as mantinades. Mantinades have either love or satire as their topics. They are invariably composed in dekapentasyllabos verse and are often antiphonal, i.e. a verse elicits a response and this leads to another response and so on.

Slander of title

In law, slander of title is normally a claim involving real estate in which one entity publishes a false statement that disparages or clouds another entity's title to property, causing a financial loss. Alternatively, it is casting aspersion on someone else's property, business or goods, e.g., claiming a house is infested with termites (when it is not), or falsely claiming ownership of another's copyright (what allegedly occurred in the "SCO v. Novell" case). Slander of title is a form of jactitation.
Slander of title is one of the "specialized" common law intentional torts. The State of California has adopted the definition of slander of title set forth in section 624 of the "Restatement of Torts" as follows:
The term "slander of title" is somewhat of a misnomer, as slander refers to that which is spoken yet the tort slander of title requires publication. A more accurate term would be "disparagement of title". 
A slander of title suit can be pursued with merit in a variety of circumstances including "the filing of an invalid lien against real property or virtually any type of recordable instrument recorded against a property by one without privilege which is untrue." It is not a requirement that it be recorded, merely published, and in the broadest sense of the word. "Published" can even refer to the placement of a lawn sign with an untrue disparaging statement in front of someone's property.

Ratnajeevan Hoole

Professor Samuel Ratnajeevan Herbert Hoole (born 15 September 1952; commonly known as Ratnajeevan Hoole) is a Sri Lankan Tamil engineer and academic. He was a member of the Election Commission of Sri Lanka.
Early life and family.
Hoole was born on 15 September 1952. He is the son of Rev. Richard Herbert Ratnathurai Hoole and Jeevamany Somasundaram. He was educated at Nallur CMS Practising School and St. John's College, Jaffna. He was offered a position to study at the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya in 1970 but as there were too many Tamil students at Peradeniya he was transferred to the Ceylon College of Technology, graduating from the University of Sri Lanka Katubedda campus in 1975 with a B.Sc degree in electrical engineering. He received a M.Sc. in electrical machines and power systems from the University of London in 1977 and a Ph.D. in electromagnetic field computation from Carnegie Mellon University in 1983. In 1993 he received a D.Sc. in computational electromagnetics from the University of London.
Hoole is married to Dushyanthi Hoole, a fellow academic from the Michigan State University. They have three daughters (Mariyahl Mahilmany, Elisapeththu Elilini and Annahl Anbini) and a son (Yovahn Yesuraiyan Ratnajeevan). He is the brother of Rajan Hoole. Hoole is a Christian and a member of the Church of Ceylon. He holds dual Sri Lankan and US citizenship.
Career.
Hoole was an instructor in electrical engineering at University of Sri Lanka Katubedda campus for a brief period in 1975 before moving to Singapore in 1976 to work as an engineer for an engineering consultancy firm. He was a lecturer in electrical engineering at The Polytechnic, Ibadan between 1977 and 1980. In 1981 he was a Westinghouse Intern and a teaching assistant at McGill University and in 1982 he was a graduate assistant at Carnegie Mellon University. Hoole worked for PA Consulting Services between 1983 and 1984 before joining Drexel University in September 1984 as an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering. He joined Harvey Mudd College in July 1987 as an associate professor before being promoted to professor in January 1992. He took sabbatical leave from 1993 to 1994 to be a senior fellow at the National University of Singapore. Hoole left Harvey Mudd College in 1997 to work as a visiting professor at the Institute of Fundamental Studies, Kandy (1997) and as UNESCO professor of information technology (1998–99).
In July 1999 Hoole returned to Sri Lanka to work as a professor of electrical and information engineering at the University of Ruhuna. He joined the University of Peradeniya in December 1999 as a professor, becoming senior professor in 2003. He served as the head of the Department of Computer Science within the Faculty of Engineering (now Computer Engineering) during 2000-2001 period. Between 2003 and 2006 he was also a member of the University Grants Commission. Hoole was involved with the Citizens' Movement for Good Governance (CIMOGG) which took legal action against unfair university appointments and cheating. This led to him being threatened with disciplinary action by the University of Peradeniya authorities.
In January 2006 the senate of the University of Jaffna elected Hoole to be one of three nominees to be the university's vice-chancellor. In March 2006 President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed Hoole as vice-chancellor. As soon as he was appointed Hoole started receiving threats from various Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) fronts including the People's Uprising Force who said he would return home "headless in a box" if he took up the position. Hoole did not assume his duties on 15 March 2006 and his predecessor S. Mohanadas was appointed acting vice-chancellor. Hoole chose instead to work from outside Jaffna, appointing a deputy vice-chancellor and a head of Vavuniya campus. As the threats continued Hoole and his family left Sri Lanka 20 April 2006.
Hoole was visiting professor at Michigan State University (2006) and Drexel University (2006-08). He was professor of engineering and science at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute between 2008 and 2010.
Hoole returned to Sri Lanka in September 2010 to co-ordinate the establishment of the University of Jaffna's new Faculty of Engineering. In December 2010 the senate of the University of Jaffna once again elected Hoole to be one of three nominees to be the university's vice-chancellor. However, this time President Rajapaksa did not appoint him vice-chancellor, choosing instead Vasanthy Arasaratnam.
During the 2011 local government elections in Sri Lanka Hoole documented and reported on violations of electoral law by the Eelam People's Democratic Party, a government backed paramilitary group led by government minister Douglas Devananda. After Devananda complained to the police about the "defamatory article", Hoole gave a statement to the police on 2 August 2011. On 4 August 2011 the police summoned him to appear at Kayts magistrates court the following day, telling him that he may be remanded. Hoole did not attend the magistrate but instead sent his lawyer N. Srikantha. The magistrate found Hoole to be in contempt for not attending in person and issued a warrant for his arrest if he did not attend the court on 15 August 2011. Fearing detention in Kayts, Hoole fled Sri Lanka for a second time.
Hoole is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and chartered engineer. In 2012, Hoole held a professor affiliation at the department of electrical engineering at Michigan State University.

1993–94 Vyshcha Liha

1993–94 Vyshcha Liha was the third season of the Vyshcha Liha.
Last season the league champions Dynamo received a fierce competition from the Pavlov led Dnipro out of Dnipropetrovsk. The third season was promising to be even more exciting. Dynamo was going through some difficult times and before the start of the season, it was sold to Hryhoriy Surkis from Viktor Bezverkhyi.
The season started on August 8 with nine games of the first round. It finally was concluded on June 19. It was anticipated that at least four clubs would be really competing for the top title. At the end, it turned out the other way around. Dnipro has remarkably given up its positions, losing almost ten games. Chornomorets also did not pose any resistance to neither Dynamo or Shakhtar. However, the biggest surprise was the relegation of Metalist Kharkiv which won only six games. Metalurh Zaporizhzhia barely escaped relegation, partially due to their excellent game in Kharkiv where they manage to thrash the local Metalist 3:0. Three rounds before the end Dynamo was recognized as the champions. There was one technical loss (-:+) that was awarded again to SC Tavriya Simferopol when it was hosting FC Volyn Lutsk in the 32nd round on June 11, 1994, for fielding a suspended player Dzyubenko.

Part Chimp

Part Chimp is an English noise rock band from Camberwell, London, that was formed by Tim Cedar, Jon Hamilton and Nick Prior in 2000. Their current line-up is Tim (vocals and guitar), Jon (drums), Joe McLaughlin (bass), Robin Freeman (bass), and Iain Hinchliffe (guitar).
They play rock music with elements of noise. Both in recordings and live performances, Part Chimp have a reputation for sounding extremely loud. Their records have been released in the UK by Rock Action Records, in Europe and Japan by Play It Again Sam, and in the US by Monitor records.
History.
Tim Cedar and Jon Hamilton had previously played together in Ligament. Nick Prior (bass), formerly of Scarfo, joined Ligament for their last tour. When Ligament split, the threesome played one show as Part Chimp in late 2000, before adding Iain Hinchliffe on guitar. Nick Prior left the band in February 2004 and was replaced by Joe McLaughlin. In 2008, Tracy Bellaries (ex-Ikara Colt) joined on bass, playing on the "Thriller" record before leaving in early 2010. After a brief band hiatus, Joe McLaughlin rejoined and played on the "Iv" lp, "Cheap Thriller" and the 2021 release "Drool" alongside touring bassist Robin Freeman.

Willie Mabon

Willie James Mabon (October 24, 1925 – April 19, 1985) was an American R&amp;B singer, songwriter, pianist, and harmonica player. He had two number one hits on the "Billboard" R&amp;B chart, "I Don't Know" in 1952 and "I'm Mad" in 1953.
Career.
Mabon was born and brought up in the Hollywood district of Memphis, Tennessee. He moved to Chicago in 1942, by which time he had become known as a singer and pianist. He formed a group, the Blues Rockers, and in 1949 began recording for Aristocrat Records and then Chess Records.
His biggest success came in 1952 when his debut solo release, "I Don't Know", written by Cripple Clarence Lofton (who received no royalties), topped the "Billboard" R&amp;B chart for eight weeks.
It was one of the most popular releases of its era and was Chess's biggest hit before the successes of Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. It was also one of the first R&amp;B hit records to be covered by a leading white artist, Tennessee Ernie Ford. Mabon's original was played on Alan Freed's early radio shows and also sold well to white audiences, crossing over markets at the start of the rock-and-roll era.
Mabon returned to the top R&amp;B slot in 1953 with "I'm Mad" and had another hit in 1954 with the Mel London song "Poison Ivy". He also was the first artist to record Willie Dixon's "The Seventh Son". However, his career failed to maintain its momentum, and record releases in the late 1950s on various labels were largely unsuccessful. Releases in the 1960s included "Got to Have Some", "Just Got Some", and "I'm the Fixer".
He moved to Paris in 1972 and toured and recorded in Europe as part of the promoter Jim Simpson's "American Blues Legends" tour, recording "The Comeback" for Simpson's Big Bear Records and an album for Ornament Records in 1977. He also performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival. He died in April 1985, after a long illness, in Paris.

Enrique Guaita

Enrique Guaita (; 11 July 1910 – 18 May 1959), also known as Enrico Guaita (), was an Italian Argentine footballer who played for both Argentina and Italy as a forward. He helped win the 1933–35 Central European International Cup &amp; the World Cup in 1934 with Italy.
He played most of his footballing career in Argentina with Estudiantes and Racing Club, but also played in Italy with Roma where he was nicknamed "Il Corsaro Nero".
Club career.
Guaita played for Estudiantes de La Plata, where he was part of the famous attack "Los Profesores". In 1934, he moved to Italy, where he probably played his best football. He played two seasons for AS Roma from 1933 to 1935. He was the top-scorer of the League in 1934–35, with 28 goals. He became known as "Il Corsaro Nero". Fearing being drafted by the Italian army, in 1936, he returned to Argentina, where he played for Racing Club de Avellaneda and, again, Estudiantes de La Plata. He retired at the end of the 1939 season.
International career.
Guaita was one of twelve Argentine players to represent both Argentina (four caps, one goal) and Italy (ten caps, five goals) at national level, before banning the simultaneous playing for more than one national team. With Argentina, he won the 1937 South American Championship, and with the Italy national team, he scored the only goal in the semi-final match of the 1934 FIFA World Cup against Austria to give Italy a 1–0 title win on home soil. He also won the 1933–35 Central European International Cup with Italy.

<doc id="7002922" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7002922" title="SS Michelangelo">
SS Michelangelo

SS "Michelangelo" was an Italian ocean liner built in 1965 for Italian Line by Ansaldo Shipyards, Genoa. She was one of the last ships to be built primarily for liner service across the North Atlantic. Her sister ship was the SS "Raffaello".
Design and construction.
The Italian Line began planning new ships in 1958. Originally, they were to be slightly larger than SS "Leonardo da Vinci", which was then being built, but jet aircraft had not yet had a notable effect on the Mediterranean area and a pair of genuine superliners seemed desirable, both from a commercial point of view and to provide jobs to sailors and shipyard workers. The new ships were to be the largest built in Italy since the SS "Rex" in 1932.
Accommodations aboard the ships were to be divided into three classes. For some reason, the three bottom-most passenger decks would not have any portholes. This was claimed to make the ship's sleek hull shape, but that seems unlikely to be true as ships of similar length/width ratio have been built with windows along the entire hull. Whatever the shortcomings in their initial design, though, the new sisters were advanced on the technological side. The most striking feature in the ships was their Turin polytechnic-designed funnels, which consisted of an intricate trellis-like pipework (instead of the traditional even surface) to allow wind to pass through the funnel, and a large smoke deflector fin on the top. Although criticised, the funnel design proved to be highly effective in keeping smoke off the rear decks. The smoke deflectors became popular in ship design during the 1970s and 1980s, whereas the idea of allowing wind to pass through the funnel was picked up again in the late 1980s and is almost the norm in modern shipbuilding.
The "Michelangelo"s interiors were designed by naval architects Nino Zoncada, Vincenzo Monaco, and Amedeo Luccichenti, who gave the ship a less adventurous, more traditional look than the designers of her sister "Raffaello".
Service.
After several delays, the "Michelangelo", under command of Senior Captain Mario Crepaz, was finally ready for service in May 1965. During the sea trials, some vibrations were detected on the stern of the ship. "Michelangelo" was drydocked in December 1965 and received new propellers and some modifications to her transmission. She clocked 31.59 knots during her post-refit trials, making her the fifth-fastest passenger ship in the world at the time.
On Tuesday morning, April 12, 1966, five days after having departed Genoa, "Michelangelo", under command of Senior Captain Giuseppe Soletti, was hit by an unusually large wave during a storm in the mid-Atlantic, which caused the forward part of her superstructure to collapse, or to be pushed backwards, and killed passengers Dr. Werner Berndt of Hamburg, Germany and John Steinbach of Chicago. One crew member, Desiderio Ferrari, died a few hours later, and over 50 people were injured. Among the 1,495 passengers on board this crossing were Admiral Ernesto Giurati, president of the Italian Line and former Chief of Naval Operation of the Italian Navy, Italian Chief of Protocol Angelo Corrias, who was heading for a vacation in the States, German novelist Günter Grass and his wife Anna, and Bob Montana with his wife and four children. When repairs were carried out after the accident, the aluminum plating in the superstructure was replaced by steel plates. Similar reconstruction was carried out on the "Raffaello" and other contemporary ships such as SS "United States" and SS "France".
In May 1972, Alfred Hitchcock took a voyage on this ship from New York to his screening of "Frenzy" at the Cannes Film Festival.
During the following years, passenger numbers in the transatlantic trade declined steadily due to competition from the air, and more and more ships were withdrawn. The "Michelangelo" spent more time cruising to warmer waters, but she made a poor cruise ship with her windowless cabins and three-class layout. She had large lido decks that were superior to even most purpose-built cruise ships of the time, but that was not enough to compensate for the ship's shortcomings, and Italian Line did not have enough funds to rebuild the ship to make her a more usable cruiser. Additionally, she was considered to be too large to be a cruise ship by that time's standards.
Italy's flagship SS "Michelangelo" made her last Atlantic crossing in July 1975, under command of Senior Captain Claudio Cosulich. Afterwards, she was laid up at La Spezia alongside her sister.
Sale.
Several buyers (including Knut Kloster of Norwegian Cruise Line) inspected the ships, but did not wish to buy them due to the costs required to modernise them to cruise-ship standard. One serious buyer, Home Lines, wished to buy the ships and keep them under Italian flag for cruising in the Caribbean. The Italian Line refused to sell the ships, reportedly because they felt keeping the Italian flag would have associated the "embarrassing money-losers" with them.
In 1976, a buyer was found who agreed to the terms sought by Italian Line. The Shah of Iran purchased the ships, to be used as floating barracks. The ships that had cost $45 million each were now sold at the price of $2 million per ship. The "Michelangelo" ended up in Bandar Abbas, where she was to spend the next 15 years.
In 1978, plans were made to reconstruct her as the luxury cruise ship "Scià Reza il Grande" (in honour of Rezā Shāh), but an expert team sent from Italy to inspect the ship came to the conclusion she was too badly deteriorated to make rebuilding a viable option. Similar plans were made again in 1983, but they, too, fell short.
Finally, in June 1991, she was scrapped in Gadani ship-breaking yard, Pakistan.

1992 Vyshcha Liha

The 1992 Vyshcha Liha () was the first football championship organized by the reformed Football Federation of Ukraine after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Football Federation of Ukraine, when organizing the competition, decided to shift its calendar to synchronize it with a common in Europe "fall-spring" and organized a short championship to secure berth spots for the 1992–93 European club competitions.
The newly formed competition involved the participation of Ukraine-based football "teams of masters" (professional teams) from the top All-Union football competitions, including the 1991 Soviet Vysshaya Liga teams.
The first two games of Round 1 took place on 6 March 1992 in Odesa, where local Chornomorets was hosting Karpaty, and Mykolaiv, where local Evis was playing against the visiting Temp.
Teams and organization.
League's formation and issues.
Composition.
The league and its calendar were adopted at the FFU Executive Committee session on 10 September 1991 with the ongoing 1991 season of the All-Soviet football competitions. It was established that the new league will consist of 20 teams divided into two groups. Six clubs (last three from each group) were set to be relegated and replaced with the two best from the First League, thus reducing the league for the next season to 16. Winners of both groups were to play against one another for the national title. The league's final was originally planned to consist of two games (home and away), but later, due to scheduling of the Ukraine national football team's games, it was changed to one on a neutral field.
To the league were included all Ukrainian clubs of the 1991 Soviet Top and First leagues (8 clubs), nine of eleven Ukrainian clubs out the 1991 Soviet Second League (all of them competed in the west zone), the two best teams of the 1991 Soviet Second (lower) League and the winner of the Ukrainian Cup. The FFU president Viktor Bannikov was against to include the Ukrainian Cup winner into the top league.
There were opponents of organization of the championship among the most notable was FC Metalurh Zaporizhya. The FC Metalist Kharkiv was against with the condition if they would be relegated from the 1991 Soviet Top League. Also against the championship was Yevhen Kucherevskyi (FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, one of few Ukrainian coaches who managed to win the Soviet Top League).
There were plenty of alternative propositions on the composition and the season's calendar, among which were from the president of Prykarpattia Anatoliy Revutskyi and the head coach of Temp Ishtvan Sekech.
Calendar.
The championship started on March 6, about a month after the qualification rounds of another national tournament, the first edition of Ukrainian Cup. The first half of the season was scheduled to finish on April 19, with the second one to resume on April 25 (6 days intermission). The last round was to be played on June 17.
Considering such a schedule and the fact that the Ukrainian Cup competition was on the way simultaneously, the Ukrainian clubs had to forfeit their scheduled games in the Soviet Cup competition. In addition to that, Dynamo Kyiv also participated in the Champions League competition, which ended for Dynamo only on April 15. Each team this season had at least two games scheduled every week on average.
Considering other official games (outside of the league), FC Torpedo Zaporizhzhia and FC Dynamo Kyiv have played a record 26 games from February 18 through June 21, the most among the other clubs in the League.

Herman Spöring Jr.

Herman Diedrich Spöring Jr. (1733–1771) was a Finnish explorer, draughtsman, botanist and a naturalist.
Early life.
Herman Spöring Jr. was born in 1733 in the town of Turku, at that time a major Finnish city and administrative center of the Swedish Empire. He was the son of an amateur naturalist and professor of Medicine at the Academy of Åbo, Herman Spöring Sr. (1701–1747), in Turku, Finland. Spöring Jr. attended the Academy as a youth, studying medicine under his father. Sometime around 1755, at his age of 22, he moved to London, where he began working at a watchmakers. During this time, he became acquainted with the Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander, who employed him as his personal clerk for a time.
In 1768, Spöring Jr. was enlisted as a clerk, assistant naturalist and personal secretary in the entourage of Joseph Banks, a wealthy young botanist who was preparing for an expedition to the Pacific Ocean, sponsored by the British Royal Society. This expedition had as one of its principal goals the observation of the transit of Venus. However, it was also intended to make scientific studies of the flora and fauna of any new lands encountered on the way of the voyage. Indeed, the confidential purpose of the voyage - from the point of view of the British Admiralty, in particular - was to seek out the hypothetical "unknown southern continent", or"Terra Australis (Incognita)".
The other noted naturalist on the voyage was Daniel Solander, Spöring's former employer who had recommended Spöring for the post when he himself signed up. Solander was a former student and protégé of the noted Swedish botanist and founder of modern taxonomy, Carl Linnaeus. Spöring was also a skilled instrument and clock maker, and in addition to his cataloging duties was assigned the maintenance and upkeep of the ship's scientific equipment during the voyage.
Voyage to the Pacific.
The expedition left England in 1768, aboard HM Bark "Endeavour" under the command of R.N. Lt. James Cook, bound for the Society Islands (present-day Tahiti). They arrived there in 1769, where the observations of Venus were taken during the transit on 3 June. Spöring had to repair the astronomical quadrant after it had become damaged when it was taken by the local Polynesian inhabitants.
Leaving the Society Islands, the expedition sailed southwards, reaching New Zealand where Spöring Jr. and the other naturalists became the first ever European to have landed there. The ensuing months were spent gathering and documenting specimens of native plant and animal life there. At a bay now known as Tolaga Bay (not far from the modern township of Gisborne), Cook bestowed the name Spöring Island to a landmark, after the botanist. Today, the island is best known by its original Māori name, "Pourewa".
The expedition continued westwards, and in 1770 the "Endeavour" encountered the southeastern coastline of the Australian continent, and became the first European vessel to have navigated the eastern side of the continent. The expedition made first landfall at a site Cook named Botany Bay, very near the site at which 18 years later the colony of Sydney would be established. Banks, Solander and Spöring collected further unique specimens from this site. This collection would be greatly augmented later when the "Endeavour" was laid up for several weeks for repairs, after having run aground on a section of the Great Barrier Reef much further to the north. The naturalists availed themselves of the opportunity whilst repairs were being made to continue their compilation of new species. 
The first meeting between the Aboriginal people and the British explorers occurred on 29 April 1770 when Lieutenant James Cook landed at Botany Bay (Kamay) and encountered the Gweagal clan. Two Gweagal men opposed the landing party and in the confrontation one of them was shot and wounded.
At some point in his life, Spöring Jr. created an art piece featuring the now rare Heva Tūpāpāʻu funeral costume from Tahiti, of which very few examples still exist.
Once the repairs were completed, the expedition continued northwards to the East Indies port of Batavia (Jakarta). Until this point in the voyage, no crewmember or passenger had been lost to disease; however, the unhealthy conditions of the port and their new provisions would soon result in quite a few deaths, including that of Spöring himself. In 1771 on the return leg, Spöring died of dysentery complications related to food poisoning. He was buried at sea on 24 January 1771. 
Achievements and commemorations.
He has a commemorative statue dedicated to him in Sydney, Australia.
In 1990, a rock taken from Pourewa (Spöring) Island was transported to Spöring's birthplace of Åbo, Finland, to be placed in a monument set up to commemorate his achievements and ties with New Zealand, as the first Finn to have landed there.
Amongst his achievements are the discovery and illustration of a number of hitherto-unknown Australian species. His colleagues and successors who studied his materials have recognised the accuracy and form of his drawings and annotations. His efforts, along with those of others on the voyage provided critical new materials for study, which allowed further advances in the historical development of the theory of evolution to be made.

Warlocks Motorcycle Club (Florida)

The Warlocks Motorcycle Club, also sometimes distinguished as the Phoenix Warlocks or the Florida Warlocks, is an international outlaw motorcycle club that was founded in 1967 in Florida, United States by ex-US naval servicemen serving on the aircraft carrier . It is a "One Percenter motorcycle club" with chapters in various parts of the United States, Canada, England, and Germany. Established by Tom "Grub" Freeland, an ex-US Navy veteran in Orlando, Florida, in 1967. The Mother Chapter is still located there. The club's founder, Tom "Grub" Freeland, died in 2019.
History.
In February of 1967, thirteen sailors aboard the U.S.S. "Shangri-La" were on an eight month deployment with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. Among them was the future club's founder, Thomas Freeland, also known as Grub. All of them, being motorcycle enthusiasts, and discussing plans on what to do after returning home, discussed forming a motorcycle club together. One suggested the name Warlocks and one designed the Phoenix logo. They then made plans, that each of the thirteen new brothers would found a chapter in his hometown after retiring from the Navy. With most of the members, the euphoria passed very quickly after their return from service. But one brother, who took this commitment seriously enough to make this dream a reality, was Grub from Lockhart, Florida. The original chapter he founded was on the outskirts of Orlando, where the club's mother chapter remains to this day.
On February 21, 1991, Raymond "Bear" Chaffin, president of the club’s Smyrna Beach, Florida chapter, was shot to death in his garage. Chaffin was in talks to merge interests with the Hells Angels down in Florida, as well as in talks with the Boozefighters about patching over into the Warlocks, which would have made them one of the largest motorcycle clubs in the world at the time. The ATF would later use his funeral as an opportunity for a raid to arrest members of the club after the end of a 13 month long sting operation led by ATF agent Stephen Martin.
Global Charters.
The Warlocks have chapters in four countries, most of which are active in the United States. There are fourteen chapters in Florida, seven in South Carolina, five in Virginia, four in West Virginia, three in Georgia, two in Ohio, three in New York, five in New Jersey, One in Connecticut, one in Indiana , two in Minnesota, one in Michigan, two in Canada (one frozen), three in England, and two in Germany and their growth continues. There are also several Nomads who live and work in states that don't have Warlocks chapters.
Insignia.
The club's insignia is a blazing Phoenix between a top and bottom rocker, their colors are crimson red, yellow and black. Mottos include "Our Business is None of Your Fucking Business" and ""Warlocks forever, forever Warlocks" ("W.F.F.W."").
Criminal allegations and incidents.
United States.
The Warlocks are considered by law enforcement to be among the many second-tier, after the "Big Four", outlaw motorcycle gangs. The Warlocks have a rivalry with the Outlaws and the Pagans.
The Warlocks were investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in 1991, after Stephen Martin, an undercover agent, infiltrated the club. Several members were subsequently arrested and released. It was made clear by all involved outside of law enforcement that none of the illegal activities would have ever transpired without being initiated by Stephen Martin. Again, in 2003 the ATF investigated the Warlocks, and convicted several members of drug and weapon charges once more.
Steven Brown known as “Steve-O” was convicted of trafficking 400 grams or more of methamphetamine by a Lexington County jury in South Carolina. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. 
Canada.
Several Warlocks bikers and associates were arrested in the small town of Drayton Valley in Alberta, Canada town in March 2014 on weapons charges.

African Union Mission to Somalia

The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) was a multinational force formed by the African Union. The operation deployed to Somalia soon after the Islamic Courts Union was deposed by troops from Ethiopia during a large scale invasion in late 2006. The missions primary objective was to maintain the regime change between the ICU and the newly installed Transitional Federal Government, implement a national security plan and train the TFG security forces. As part of its duties, AMISOM later supported the Federal Government of Somalia in its war against Al-Shabaab. AMISOM was the most deadly peacekeeping operation in the post-war era.
AMISOM was created by the African Union's Peace and Security Council on 19 January 2007 with an initial six-month mandate. On 21 February 2007 the United Nations Security Council approved the mission's mandate. Subsequent six-monthly renewals of AMISOM's mandate by the African Union Peace and Security Council have also been authorized by the United Nations Security Council.
In March 2007, the first AMISOM troops deployed to Somalia, landing in Mogadishu as fighting was raging between Islamist insurgents and Ethiopian/TFG forces. After four years of intense urban fighting against Al-Shabaab in Mogadishu, during the Battle of Mogadishu (2010–2011) the Uganda People's Defence Force (Army) and Burundian Army forced the militants to withdraw from the capital. In 2014, the Ethiopia was integrated into AMISOM. In the succeeding years 2012-2015 a number of towns in the hinterland were recaptured, though most of the rural clans remained under Al-Shabaab rule.
The duration of AMISOM's mandate had been extended in each period that it has been up for review, until it was replaced on April 1, 2022, by the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia. On 21 December 2021, the United Nations Security Council reauthorized AMISOM in Somalia for three months. The new mandate ran until 31 March 2022, ahead of a phased handover of responsibilities to Somalia's security forces in early 2023. AMISOM's mandate ended on 31 March 2022, and was replaced by the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia.
Background.
During 2005 the Transitional Federal Government was deeply divided over the issue of a possible deployment of foreign troops in Somalia. Various prominent Somali leaders and groups threatened to forcefully oppose such an intervention. The IGAD planned on deploying in March 2005 despite significant opposition, though the operation was cancelled. As early as 25 March 2005 the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), a rising Islamist group fighting warlords in Mogadishu, warned that any foreigner peacekeepers deployed to Somalia would be unwelcome and face death. Faced with the ascendancy of the ICU after taking over the capital in the Battle of Mogadishu between May and June 2006, UN-watchers were growing concerned with the level of hostility of the ICU towards the proposed foreign deployment. The African Union adopted a plan to deploy troops to Somalia on 14 September 2006. Plans for a foreign deployment continued, though the ICU was clearly opposed, as they saw IGASOM as a US/Western means to curb their growth. Until December 2006, the UN Security Council had imposed an arms embargo on the group, but the embargo was partially lifted and a mandate for foreign troops was issued on 6 December 2006 for six months.
The African Union's involvement in the war came at the insistence of both Ethiopia and the United States for the organization to take over the role of ‘regime changer’. In effect, the newly planned AU military operation in Somalia was an attempt to legitimize the Ethiopian invasion and TFG. According to Cocodia, "AMISOM was more a tool for regime change than it was a peace operation." AMISOM's deployment served as an exit strategy for Ethiopian troops, as their presence was inflaming an insurgency. On 20 February 2007, the United Nations granted authorization for the deployment of a peacekeeping mission by the African Union, known as the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). The mission's stated primary objective was to provide support for a national reconciliation congress in Somalia. From 2007 to 2009, AMISOM was predominantly composed of troops from Uganda, Burundi, and a few Kenyans. During 2007, the operation relied heavily on Ugandan Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF), as Uganda played a crucial role in offering support to the initiation of the mission. By the end of the year, Burundian troops also joined the effort. AMISOM's initial mandate did not permit the use of offensive force, resulting in limited involvement in the conflict between Ethiopian forces and the insurgency. This dynamic led to growing tensions between AMISOM and the ENDF, exacerbated by a lack of transparency from Ethiopia regarding its objectives within Somalia. The European Union was reportedly 'exceptionally unhappy' about the heavy US support for the December invasion, and held back funds for the newly created AMISOM mission for several months.
Authorization.
The African Union Peace and Security Council authorized AMISOM in January 2007, explicitly assuming that it would become a UN mission after six months. On 21 February 2007, the United Nations Security Council authorized the AU to deploy a peacekeeping mission with a mandate of six months. On 20 August 2007, the United Nations Security Council extended the African Union's authorisation to continue deploying AMISOM for a further six months and requested the Secretary-General to explore the option of replacing AMISOM with a United Nations mission to Somalia.On 31 May 2019, the Security Council unanimously approved United Nations Security Council Resolution 2472, authorising Member States of the African Union to maintain the deployment of AMISOM until 31 May 2020, with a reduction of the number of troops to 19,626 by 28 February 2020.
The Security Council decided [on 29 May] to reauthorize the deployment of African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) personnel for nine months, requiring them to support security in the lead-up to elections and to work towards the gradual hand-over of responsibility to Somali forces by 2021.
Mission planning.
Scope of the mission.
IGASOM was expected to eventually reach 8,000 troops, with an expected cost of $335 million for the first year. According to UN Security Council Resolution 1725, states bordering Somalia would not be eligible to deploy troops under IGASOM. The remaining (non-bordering) IGAD member nations include Sudan, Eritrea, and Uganda. Because of the objection of the burden falling on these three nations alone (and the rivalry between Ethiopia and Eritrea), the mission was expanded to include other member states of the African Union.
AMISOM has a different composition. As proposed, it comprised an initial three battalions, growing to a total of nine battalions of 850 troops each, which would serve for an initial stabilization period of six months. The mission was to be modelled after the African Union Mission in Burundi (AMIB).
ICU resistance.
Though IGAD and the ICU met and published a cordial and formal communique committing the ICU to the IGAD plans on 2 December, by the time United Nations Security Council Resolution 1725 was passed on 6 December, the ICU was openly and militantly opposed to peacekeepers entering Somalia, and vowed to treat any peacekeepers as hostile forces. Because of regional divisions, there were also UIC resistance to allowing Ethiopian troops be part of the mission. Ethiopia, for its part, was leery of allowing Eritrean troops to be members of the IGAD peacekeeping force.
In the face of ICU threats, Uganda, the only IGAD members who had openly offered to send forces (a battalion), withdrew in the face of concerns of the present feasibility of the mission. In Uganda's defense, the crisis does not allow for peacekeepers when there are active hostilities conducted with heavy weapons (see Battle of Baidoa).
On 1 January 2007, after the defeat of the ICU in various battles in December 2006, Uganda again renewed its pledge of a battalion of troops. Between Uganda and Nigeria (which is a Member State of the African Union, but not of Intergovernmental Authority on Development), there was a pledge of a total of 8,000 peacekeepers. Ghana, Rwanda and Tanzania were reported to be considering sending forces.
Gathering support.
Following the defeat of the Islamic Courts Union in December 2006 – January 2007 the international community began to gather both fiscal commitments as well as military forces for the mission. Nations of the African Union (AU) outside the Intergovernmental Authority on Development community were drawn on to provide support.
On 17 January 2007, the US ambassador to Kenya, Michael Ranneberger, said the US pledged $40 million to support the deployment of a peacekeeping force for Somalia. By 20 January, the European Union followed with a pledge of 15 million euros. On 19 January 2007 the mission was formally defined and approved by the African Union at the 69th meeting of the Peace and Security Council. On 22 January 2007 Malawi agreed to send a half-battalion to a battalion (ranging widely anywhere between approximately 400 to 1,200 troops) for a peacekeeping mission to Somalia. On 24 January 2007 Nigeria pledged a battalion (a force between 770 and 1,100 troops) to join the Somali peacekeeping mission.
On 1 February 2007 Burundi committed to the peacekeeping mission, pledging up to 1,000 troops. By 27 March, it was confirmed that 1700 Burundian peacekeepers would be sent to Somalia. On 2 February 2007, the United Nations Security Council welcomed the advent of the African Union and Intergovernmental Authority on Development-led peacekeeping mission. On 5 February 2007 Tanzania offered to train Somali government troops, but not to deploy peacekeepers. On 9 February 2007 a gathering of 800 Somali demonstrators in north Mogadishu, where Islamist support was strongest, burned U.S., Ethiopian, and Ugandan flags in protest of the proposed peacekeeping mission. A masked representative of the resistance group, the Popular Resistance Movement in the Land of the Two Migrations, said Ethiopian troops would be attacked in their hotels; the same group had made a video warning peacekeepers to avoid coming to Somalia. By this date, Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, Malawi and Burundi had committed to the peacekeeping mission, but the total force was about half of the proposed 8,000-strong force. Uganda had pledged 1,400 troops and some armored vehicles for a mission lasting up to 9 months, and the AU had pledged $11.6 million. On 16 February 2007 Uganda announced it would deploy 1,500 well-seasoned troops as early as Saturday, 17 February 2007 under the command of Major General Levi Karuhanga. Reportedly the troops had been training for two years in preparation for the mission.
Deployment to Somalia.
Days before AMISOM deployed in Somalia, violence in Mogadishu began rapidly escalating. On 6 March 2007, the first African Union troops landed at Mogadishu airport alongside three military vehicles.
The Burundian troops were technically ready to go in early August 2007, but equipment promised by the United States and France had not yet arrived. On 23 December 2007, an advance force of 100 Burundians was deployed and another 100 soldiers arrived on 2007-12-24. By late 2008, 1,700 Burundian soldiers were deployed to Mogadishu.
On July 28, 2009, the World Health Organization was notified that 21 AMISOM soldiers in Mogadishu had become sick, and three had died, with acute peripheral edema, difficulty in breathing, palpitations, and fever. The WHO, together with the U.S. Center for Disease Control, AMISOM, and the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi began an investigation. From April 26, 2009, to May 1, 2010, 241 AU soldiers had lower limb edema and at least one additional symptom; four patients died. At least 52 soldiers were airlifted to hospitals in Kenya and Uganda. Four of 31 hospitalized patients had right-sided heart failure with pulmonary hypertension. The illness was associated with exclusive consumption of food provided to troops (not eating locally acquired foods). Because the syndrome was clinically compatible with wet beriberi, thiamine was administered to affected soldiers, resulting in rapid and dramatic resolution.
Expanding role.
In a closed door meeting in Kampala on 22 July 2010, AU ministers agreed to expand the mission's mandate from a peacekeeping focus to a peace-enforcement focus that would engage al-Shabaab more directly. The decision came soon after deadly bomb attacks in the Ugandan capital. A few days later in response to UN pressure, the AU agreed not to expand the mandate but did allow preemptive strikes against Al-Shabaab and promised more troops from other African countries.
On 23 July 2010, Djibouti and Guinea pledged troops to AMISOM. On 17 September 2010, an AU envoy said in Nairobi that AMISOM's size had grown from 6,300 to 7,200 troops after an additional battalion from Uganda joined the force. In December 2010, the UN backed AMISOM in increasing the mission's authorized size to 12,000 – UN Security Council resolution 1964 of 22 December 2010 – and at the same time reports indicated that Uganda had promised an extra 1,800 personnel, with Burundi an extra 850.
In March 2011 Burundi sent 1,000 extra soldiers to AMISOM, bringing the total number of Burundi troops deployed to 4,400. AFP, reported in Africa Research Bulletin, said Burundian military chief General Godefroid Niyombare said on 14 March 2011 the soldiers had been deployed a week before.
In February 2012, the U.N. Security Council boosted the number of troops deployed from 12,000 to 17,731. The approval comes after a series of recent successes against al-Shabaab fighters who had previous positions throughout the central and southern areas of the country. During the same month, AU Commander Fred Mugisha suggested that Al-Shabaab was "at [its] weakest" and would likely "implode in the not so distant future" owing to successive military defeats that it suffered as well as an exodus toward the Arabian Peninsula of hundreds of the group's fighters.
Due to the successful military operations against the Islamists, the United States has also been stepping up efforts to train and equip the AMISOM troops in a bid to stamp out the Al-Shabaab insurgency and limit its influence.
In October 2011, the Kenya Defence Forces began Operation Linda Nchi, crossing the border into Somalia to attack Al-Shabaab. On 12 November, the Kenyan government agreed to rehat its forces under AMISOM command, and later announced in March 2012 that it would send 5,000 troops to join AMISOM.
The "East African" reported in March 2012 on reorganisation of AMISOM's headquarters and sector commands. Personnel (J1) would be led by the AU, with Kenya taking responsibility for intelligence (J2) and logistics (J4), Uganda operations (J3) and engineer (J8), Burundi plans (J5) and communications/IS (J6), Sierra Leone training (J7), and Djibouti CIMIC (J9). There would also be four sectors: Uganda responsible for Sector One (the Shabelles and Banadir), Sector Two (the Jubbas) run by Kenya, Sector Three Burundi covering GEdo, Bay, and BAkool, and Sector from which Ethiopia forces were withdrawing from to be directed by Djibouti.
On 9 August 2013, an Antonov An-24 operated by the Ethiopian Air Force crashed while attempting to land at Aden Abdulle International Airport in Mogadishu. There were six crew on board, of which four perished and two survived with injuries. The flight departed from Dire Dawa International Airport in Ethiopia at 06:00 local time that morning, commanded by Colonel Berhanu Geremew, a highly experienced pilot. It was carrying a cargo of weapons and ammunition.
In November 2013, the Ethiopian government announced that it would subordinate its troops in Somalia to AMISOM. The Ethiopian authorities' announcement came a month after a failed October bombing attempt by Al-Shabaab in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, and a week after Ethiopia received a renewed terrorism threat from the insurgent group.
According to Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ambassador Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM was intended to render the peacekeeping operation more secure. Analysts suggested that the move was primarily motivated by financial considerations, with the Ethiopian forces' operational costs now slated to be under AMISOM's allowance budget. It was hoped that the Ethiopian military's long experience in Somali territory, its equipment such as helicopters, and the potential for closer coordination would help AMISOM and Somali forces advance their territorial gains. On the other hand, there is a certain amount of unease following Ethiopia's entry into AMISOM given local animosity originating from Ethiopia's heavy handed intervention in 2006. There are also fears that Al Shabaab could use Somali animosity towards Ethiopia as a rallying cry and to recruit more members.
In December 2013, the U.S. government established a Military Coordination Cell in Mogadishu. The unit consists of a small team of fewer than five advisers, including planners and communicators between AMISOM and the Somali authorities. It was intended to provide consultative and planning support to allied forces in order to enhance their capacity.
From June 2021 to March 2022, the EU and its allies reimbursed Kenya nearly Sh2.54 billion, in quarterly disbursements Sh811 million, for its continued military participation in AMISOM. The funding had slowly been decreasing since it began in October 2011, with each soldier taking home only around USD $800 (Sh92,800) in this final installment.
Leadership and command.
The Head of Mission was the Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission to Somalia, or SRCC. On 7 October 2015, Francisco Caetano Jose Madeira, of Mozambique, was appointed to this position, replacing Maman Sambo Sidikou of Niger.
Force organisation.
Sectors.
On 15 October 2011 Kenyan forces crossed the border into Somalia to attack "al-Shebaab". Subsequently UN Security Council resolution 2036 of 22 February 2012 authorized an increase in AMISOM troop numbers to 17,731 to incorporate the Kenyans. This resolution took effect from mid-2012. At this time the initial Ugandan and Burundian AMISOM forces had been successful in largely clearing "al-Shebaab" militants from Mogadishu and the force was organized into new sectors.
Later, UN Security Council resolution 2124 of 12 November 2013 authorized a troop increase to 22,126 through inclusion of an Ethiopian contingent. This took effect in January 2014, when the Sector organisation was modified to:
In January 2017 Kismayo was mentioned as a separate sector – Sector 6 – under Colonel Paul Njema. On 22 November 2017 AMISOM's twitter feed announced that Colonel Fréderic Ndayisaba of Burundi was replacing Colonel Paul K Njema of the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) as Sector 6 Commander and described this command as a multinational sector composed of Burundian, Kenyan and Ethiopian troops based in Kismayo.
Contingents.
Ugandan contingents.
a. Commanders
b. Battle groups
From the first deployment of Ugandan troops during March 2007—which saw a contingent of two battalions sent to Mogadishu—the UPDF contribution to AMISOM had by 2015 expanded to three battle groups, each of two or three battalions. The following table lists what details are known of the Ugandan battle groups, or 'Ugabag', deployed under AMISOM. The information presented has been collected from Ugandan press reports (largely gleaned from the website 'Allafrica.com') and news reports on the AMISOM website.
Burundi contingents.
a. Commanders
b. Battalions
Burundi sent its first battalion to Mogadishu to join Ugandan troops in AMISOM in December 2007. It took until October 2008 to build the national contingent up to two battalions, due in part to a lack of equipment. But subsequently the Burundi contingent increased to a six battalion force. The Burundi force commitment is frequently cited as 5432 troops, which would align with a contingent of six battalions (of about 850 personnel each, the UN 'standard') together with headquarters and support elements.
40, 41 and 42 Battalions were scheduled for deployment in November 2016 but this was delayed. There was speculation this delay was a result of disappointment within Burundi over delays in EU payments in support of AMISOM and the suggestion by the EU that payments could be made directly to the Burundian troops rather than through the Burundi government; or domestic political tensions within Burundi arising from the president running for a third term of office. By January 2017 the Burundi government threatened to withdraw its forces from Somalia altogether, arguing that these were a national contingent and not mere mercenaries, as would be suggested by the troops receiving payment directly from any third party. Subsequently agreement was reached on the question of EU payments and it was announced the Burundi contingents would remain with AMISOM in Somalia.
Kenyan contingents.
Contingent/ Sector 2 Commanders
Djiboutian contingents.
a. Sector 4 Commander
b. Djibouti Contingent Commander
Sierra Leone contingent.
Later, during April 2018, a Formed Police Unit of 160 Sierra Leone Police was deployed to AMISOM under the command of Mustafa Solomon Kambeh.
Civil staff.
The civilian staff of AMISOM has been operating from Nairobi, Kenya since 2008 due to the security situation in Mogadishu. As of now, they number approximately 81 personnel.
Since the beginning of 2011 AMISOM and TFG has taken control over several strategic places in Mogadishu after several offensives against Al-Shabaab.
With the expanded control over the capital AMISOM on 16 May 2011 moved the civil staff and police officers to Mogadishu. This includes Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission for Somalia (SRCC) Ambassador Boubacar Gaoussou Diarra and deputy (SRCC) Honourable Wafula Wamunyinyi.
Much of the key logistical support for the force was provided by the United Nations Support Office for AMISOM (UNSOA), a field mission of the UN Secretariat Department of Field Support.
The Civilian component was supervised by the Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission for Somalia (SRCC) which was represented on the ground by Ambassador Mahamat Saleh Annadif. who oversees the Political, Civil, Humanitarian, Gender and Public Information departments.
Ambassador Epiphanie Kabushemeye-Ntamwana was the civilian Chief of Staff.
The Chief Administrative Officer Timothy Kiguti heads the support component of the mission which includes administration personnel, finance and budgeting, logistics and procurement among other issues.
The Police contingent, which provides capacity building, both institutional and individual in support of the Somali Police Force, was headed by the AMISOM Police Commissioner Anand Pillay.
Training for contingents.
The United States has provided extensive training for contingents headed for Somalia. In the first half of 2012, Force Recon Marines from Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force 12 (SPMAGTF-12) trained soldiers from the Uganda People's Defence Force. In the northern spring of 2012 [March–April–May], Marines from SPMAGTF-12 also trained Burundian soldiers. In April and May, members of Task Force Raptor, 3rd Squadron, 124th Cavalry Regiment of the Texas Army National Guard, took part in a separate training mission with the BNDF in Mudubugu, Burundi. SPMAGTF-12 has also sent its trainers to Djibouti, another nation involved in the Somali mission, to work with an army unit there.
At the same time, U.S. troops have assisted in training the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces in preparation for their deployment to Somalia later this year. In June 2012, U.S. Army Africa commander Major General David R. Hogg spoke encouragingly of the future of Sierra Leone's forces in conjunction with Kenya. As of June 2012, the RSLAF troops have not yet deployed; the Sierra Leonean defence minister said on 23 June 2012, that the battalion might depart for the Horn 'some time in September [2012].'
In addition, a significant amount of support to AMISOM has been provided by private companies. "Bancroft Global Development, headquartered on Washington's Embassy Row, employs about 40 South African and European trainers who work with [AMISOM's] Ugandan and Burundian troops. Bancroft director Michael Stock told "The EastAfrican" that these mentors are embedded with AMISOM units in Mogadishu and southern and central Somalia. They coach commanders on ..how to predict and defeat the tactics which foreign fighters bring from outside East Africa and teach to al-Shabaab." Bancroft "does not receive funding directly from the US government but was instead paid by AMISOM, which was then reimbursed by the State Department for these outlays." The Associated Press reports that Bancroft has been paid $12.5 million for its work in Somalia since 2008.
A security analyst in Somalia listed three primary private security companies/private military companies operating in Mogadishu. DynCorp, who provide logistical support in the Somali capital; Bancroft International, who provide training to TFG and AMISOM personnel, as well as assisting with community service delivery; and Pacific Architects &amp; Engineers.
Casualties and major incidents.
According to SIPRI, 1,039 AMISOM soldiers were killed in action between 1 January 2009, and 31 December 2013, with an additional 69 fatalities in 2014 (per AMISOM) bringing the total to 1,108 dead from 2009 through 2014.
March 2007 – February 2011.
AMISOM medical facility records showed 110 Ugandan and 95 Burundian soldiers had died between March 2007 and February 2011 in Somalia. Another 798 AMISOM soldiers were wounded. Some of the deadliest incidents were:
2014.
Sexual abuse report.
Human Rights Watch investigation uncovers evidence of sexual exploitation of women. Western-backed African Union troops in Somalia gang-raped women and girls as young as 12 and traded food aid for sex, Human Rights Watch has said. An investigation uncovered evidence of sexual exploitation of women seeking medicine for sick babies at what they assumed was the safety of AU military bases. Human Rights Watch documented cases in a 71-page report published on 8 September 2014 with recommendations to the African Union, the United Nations, the Somali government and AMISOM donors UN, EU, UK and US. The African Union dismissed the Human Rights Watch claims as isolated cases.
2020.
29 May 2020 The Security Council reauthorized the AU Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) until 28 February 2021.
2022.
The 14 year long AMISOM mission came to an end in March 2022 and it was replaced by a Somali led operation, the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS).

Gray Matters (2006 film)

Gray Matters is a 2006 American romantic comedy film directed and written by Sue Kramer, starring Heather Graham, Tom Cavanagh, and Bridget Moynahan. The film premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival on October 21, 2006. It opened in limited release in the United States on February 23, 2007.
Plot.
Gray, a family-oriented and quiet bachelorette, lives a close-knit life with her brother, Sam. Their lifestyle is generally co-dependent, involving them living together, going to dance classes together, etc. Gray and Sam's relationship has never been thought of as strange, but once a dinner party guest mistakes the siblings as a couple, Gray and Sam decide to venture outside of one another. While discussing what they can do about their single lifestyles and how they can "hook each other up" with a significant other, their conversation continues to the park, where Gray spots a possible girlfriend for Sam. Gray introduces herself to Charlie, then to Sam, and the two instantly like each other, agreeing to see each other again.
To Gray's surprise, Sam and Charlie become engaged the morning after their meeting. Charlie and Sam are so madly in love with one another that they plan to go to Las Vegas the following morning and elope there. They invite Gray along. Gray is a little hesitant, but agrees when Charlie says they can have a "mini bachelorette party". Gray agrees and the three make their way to Vegas. While in Vegas, Gray takes Charlie out for a hen night, and after many drinks, the two share a drunken but passionate kiss. The next morning, Charlie does not remember anything, but Gray has not slept the whole night, because of how she felt with Charlie. The situation makes Gray finally realize that not only is she attracted to women, but she is also falling in love with her sister-in-law.
The events in Vegas force a journey of self-discovery, testing the relationship between two very close siblings, and finding happiness in lonely Manhattan. When Gray eventually comes out to Sam as a lesbian, he tells her that he has known all along, since they were young kids.
Later, Sam accidentally discloses Gray's sexual orientation to her entire office, which, along with Sam's encouragement, gives her impetus to find her true self, pursue relationships with women, and find her own someone to love.

Water from the Moon

"Water from the Moon" is a song by Canadian singer Celine Dion, recorded for her second English-language studio album, "Celine Dion" (1992). The song was commercially released in March 1993 as the fifth single in the United States. In Canada it was a radio single only. "Water from the Moon" was written by Diane Warren and produced by Guy Roche, with additional production by Walter Afanasieff. Warren also sang the background vocals.
Background and release.
Two music videos were made for this song. The first one is entirely in black and white (contains some religious sign and scenes). Later, they modified the video to include additional footage of Dion, colored brownish-yellow.
"Water from the Moon" peaked at number seven in Canada. In the US it had moderate success on the adult contemporary format, reaching number 11 on Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks.
Critical reception.
American magazine from "Billboard" complimented the song as a "lush" and "dramatic" ballad. An editor, Larry Flick, wrote that after a brief dance flirtation, "Dion returns to her comfy ballad turf with an appropriately dramatic bit of diva dynamite. Guy Roche's grand production values are the perfect setting for Dion's large, stirring voice". Randy Clark from "Cashbox" described it as a "big, broken-hearted ballad", stating that "her voice is a natural for hit writer Diane Warren's music, and when backed with the production of Guy Roche and Walter Afanasieff, you got a winner no matter how you look at it, or how big it sells."
Dave Sholin from the "Gavin Report" commented, "In the short timespan between her debut album and this follow-up, that awesome vocal presence has only gotten stronger. Pairing this remarkable singer with the songwriting skill of Diane Warren spells slam dunk-and the result is just that". Another editor, Ron Fell, felt it's a "forlorn ballad of exquisite sentimentality". Parry Gettelman from "Orlando Sentinel" viewed it as "a real "Star Search" contestant's dream, but Dion manages to keep it from getting too out of hand." In a 2019 retrospective review, Christopher Smith from Talk About Pop Music described it as "high drama" and a "rock-ballad". He added that "it's another excuse to show off her most prized possession, those amazing lungs!"
Music video.
A music video was made to accompany the song. It begins with various people in a small town. Children are going to or from school. Older men are playing dominoes at a cafe. Women with black veils light candles in a church. A young man, working at the pier watches Dion driving in a car through town. She wears a black headscarf. Sometimes she is also seen in a telephone booth or walking on a beach. Occasionally there are close-ups of Dion singing, with dark make-up on her eyelids. Later in the video, the young man is at home. He watches Dion, who are getting out of her car outside his window. He opens the fridge and suddenly Dion appears, pushing him away. Towards the end, a teary-eyed Dion sings. The man, looking through his window, sees Dion driving away in her car. The video was later published on Dion's official YouTube channel in 2019, and had generated more than 2.7 million views as of February 2023.

Body Blows

Body Blows is a 1993 fighting game developed and published by Team17 for the Amiga. A version for MS-DOS followed the same year. The game has been compared to "Street Fighter II". It was followed by "Body Blows Galactic" and "Ultimate Body Blows".
Gameplay.
The game follows the formula of the "Street Fighter" series. The player competes against each opponent in best-of-three matches. Each fighter has their own set of standard attack moves and special moves. Due to most Amiga joysticks of the time having one single fire button, the controls for special moves are largely simplified: one special move per character is performed by keeping the fire button pressed while holding still, while others are performed by moving in one of the eight directions and pressing the fire button. There are no combos or throws. Unlike "Street Fighter" and other similar games such as "Mortal Kombat", blocking is performed by holding the fire button while moving away from the opponent.
One characteristic gameplay feature is that, when an opponent is knocked down, the fire button of the other player is locked until the opponent gets back up and moves. This mode was labelled "mercy" when it became optional in versions of the game following the original Amiga retail release.
There are three modes of play in "Body Blows". One player arcade mode allows the player selects one characters and battles all the others in sequence until the final showdown against Max. Two player mode allows two players to take control of joysticks and fight each other using a character they desire. Tournament mode lets four or eight players play a tournament against each other.
There are 11 characters in "Body Blows". In one player mode, the player can choose from the four characters to play as, namely Danny, Junior, Nik and Lo Ray. In other modes, players can select from 10 of the characters in the game.
Release.
In summer 1993, a few months after the game was released, Team17 published an updated version of the program disk for Amiga computers. The update increases in-game speed, adds shadows to the characters and makes all the non-boss characters selectable in story mode. It also includes a few gameplay tweaks, such as an option for not locking the fire button after a fighter is knocked down and allowing the time limit setting to also apply during the match against the T-17. This upgrade was only available for a fee to owners of the retail version, who were required to send the original boot disk via mail to Team17.
Amiga AGA version.
With the release of "Ultimate Body Blows" in 1994, an updated version of the first "Body Blows" was released for the Amiga with AGA chipset, such as the A1200 and A4000. This version is installable to a hard drive and includes all the updated features from "Ultimate Body Blows", such as entirely redrawn backgrounds, slight changes in the movesets and the ability to stun the opponent. Likewise, the sprites for the characters Dan and Junior were updated to the ones first used in "Body Blows Galactic".
Reception.
In the United Kingdom, it was the top-selling Amiga game in March 1993.
It received the following reviews at the time:

Joseph Decaisne

Joseph Decaisne (7 March 1807 – 8 January 1882) was a French botanist and agronomist. He became an "aide-naturaliste" to Adrien-Henri de Jussieu (1797–1853), who served as the chair of rural botany. It was during this time that he began to study plants brought back by various travelers like those of Victor Jacquemont (1801–1832) from Asia. Decaisne used applied research, most notably on the agronomy of the madder, the yam and the ramie. He was also interested in algae.
Biography.
Although born in Brussels, Belgium, he exercised his activity exclusively in Paris. He entered in 1824 as a gardener at the "Muséum national d'histoire naturelle" (French museum of natural history) and became, in 1832, head of the "carré des semis" section. He also worked at the "Jardin des Plantes" and collaborated with Asa Gray.
In 1847 he chaired Statistical Agriculture department in the College de France.
In 1850, Decaisne followed Charles-François Brisseau de Mirbel (1776–1854) as the chair of horticulture at the Museum. In 1854 he participated in the creation of the "Société botanique de France".
The genera "Decaisnea" Hook.f. &amp; Thomson (Lardizabalaceae), "Decaisnea" Brongn. syn. of "Prescottia" Lindl., "Decaisnina" Tiegh. (Loranthaceae), "Decaisnella" (genus of fungi in the family Massariaceae), and "Decaisnea" Lindl. syn. of "Tropidia" Lindl. (Orchidaceae), were named in his honour.
He died in Paris on 8 January 1882.
Contributions to plant taxonomy.
He described the following genera of flowering plants: "Capanea" (now part of "Kohleria") and "Chrysothemis" of the family Gesneriaceae; "Sautiera" (Acanthaceae); "Lepinia", "Rhazya" (Apocynaceae); "Vancouveria" (with C.Morren) (Berberidaceae); "Ostryopsis" (Betulaceae); "Dipterygium" (Capparidaceae); "Brassaiopsis", "Cuphocarpus"*, "Dendropanax"*, "Didymopanax"*, "Fatsia"*, "Oreopanax"*, "Stilbocarpa"*, (* with Planch.)

Slovenia national cricket team

The Slovenian national cricket team is the team that represents Slovenia in international cricket. The national organising body in Slovenia, the Slovenian Cricket Association, became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2005 and an associate member in 2017.
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Slovenia and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.
History.
Early days.
It is thought that cricket was introduced to Slovenia in 1974, after Borut Čegovnik, then a 13-year-old boy from the mountain town of Mežica, was introduced to the sport on an extended visit to his penpal in Birchington-on-Sea, Kent. He received extensive coaching from his host's father, and went back to his home with a selection of cricket equipment having decided that cricket was just the thing for his town. Seventeen, mainly single-wicket, tournaments were held between 1974 and 1982, with 24 local boys playing. The game was played in the village until 1982, when several of the ringleaders moved to the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana.
Modern era.
Cricket resurfaced in Slovenia in 1997 when the Ljubljana Cricket Club was formed. The first game was played between a Slovenian President's XI and a visiting club from The Hague. That game was attended by the then Slovenian president Milan Kučan. Friendly games against sides from various countries and the British Embassy continued, and Ljubljana Cricket Club began to compete in Austrian club cricket.
In 2000, the Slovenian national cricket team made its debut in the European Representative Championships. They finished fourth in the tournament, and came second in 2002. They hosted the tournament in 2004, again finishing in fourth place. This tournament was replaced in 2006 by the Division Four of the European Championship, where Slovenia finished in fourth place out of the four teams. They will retain their Division Four place in 2009.

Mario Pizziolo

Mario Pizziolo (; 8 December 1909 – 30 April 1990) was an Italian football player and manager, who played as a central or defensive midfielder.
Club career.
Pizziolo was born in Castellammare Adriatico, province of Pescara.

Donald Spore Johnson (December 7, 1911 – April 6, 2000), nicknamed "Pep", was an American Major League Baseball second baseman for the Chicago Cubs from 1943 to 1948. A native of Chicago, he attended Oregon State University before beginning his professional baseball career.
Johnson's best seasons were during World War II. In 1944, a season in which he had a career-high 71 runs batted in, he was selected for the All-Star Game. In 1945, he was an important part of the last Cubs team until 2016 to win a pennant, hitting a career-high .302 and scoring 94 runs, tenth in the league. He was also selected for the unofficial "All-Star Game" that was organized by the Associated Press after the official game was canceled.
Until Dexter Fowler led off in the 2016 World Series, Johnson was the last Cub to come to bat in a World Series game. He grounded into a force out to end the 1945 World Series defeat to the Detroit Tigers.
Career totals for 511 games include 528 hits, 8 home runs, 175 runs batted in, 219 runs scored, a .273 batting average, and an on-base percentage of .315.
His father was former major league shortstop Ernie Johnson.

Climate of Sydney

The climate of Sydney, Australia is humid subtropical (Köppen: "Cfa"), shifting from mild and cool in winter to warm and occasionally hot in the summer, with no extreme seasonal differences since the weather has some maritime influence. Contrasting temperatures are recorded in the western suburbs, as Sydney CBD is more affected by the oceanic climate drivers than the hinterland (due to moderation by the Pacific Ocean). Despite the fact that there is no distinct dry or wet season, rainfall peaks during summer and autumn months, and is at its lowest just around the middle of the year, though precipitation can be erratic throughout the year. Precipitation varies across the region, with areas adjacent to the coast being the wettest.
In the February 1938 issue of "The Home", journalist Basil Burdett wrote, "...Even Melbourne seems like some grey and stately city of Northern Europe compared with Sydney's sub-tropical splendours." In 2023, Sydney was placed at 9th place by "Stars Insider" for having the best weather in the world. Though in 1788, Lieutenant Ralph Clark, a member of the First Fleet, stated that the thunderstorms were the most terrible he has ever experienced. In 1819, Australian explorer William Wentworth described the summer heat as "sometimes excessive" and "oppressive to Europeans", although he noted that sea breezes effectively moderated temperatures. 
General climatology.
According to the Bureau of Meteorology, Sydney falls in the temperate climate zone with warm to hot summers and no dry season. Under the Holdridge Life Zones classification, coastal Sydney falls in the Subtropical Moist Forest zone and the inland, western suburbs in the Subtropical Dry Forest zone. According to Troll-Paffen climate classification, Sydney has a "warm-temperate subtropical" climate. Sydney's plant hardiness zone ranges from zone 11a in the east to 9b in the far west.
Sydney has 109.5 clear days and 127.2 cloudy days annually, though it has around 200 days of visible sunshine if partly cloudy days or sunny breaks are counted. Overall, Sydney has just about 66% of possible sun for Jun-Aug and around 54% for Dec-Feb, making winter sunnier than summer on average, in addition to the city being sunny around 65% of the time in the year with its 2,640 hours of annual sunshine. On some hot summer days, southerly busters decrease temperatures by late afternoon or early evening. In the warm season, troughs combined with a humid air mass can bring large amounts of rainfall. In late autumn to early winter, the city can be affected by east coast lows. Afternoon windspeed recorded in Sydney Airport averages at 24.3 km/h (15.0 mph) in an annual basis, making Sydney the windiest capital city in Australia.
Sydney experiences an urban heat island effect, making certain parts of the city more vulnerable to extreme heat, particularly the west. Efforts have been introduced to investigate and mitigate this heat effect, including increasing shade from tree canopies, adding rooftop gardens to high rise structures and changing pavement colour. The El Niño Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode play an important role in determining Sydney's weather patterns: drought and bushfire on the one hand, and storms and flooding on the other. Sydney is prone to heat waves and drought, which have become more common in the 21st century.
The region of Sydney, and as well as the rest of the New South Wales coastline, is warmed by the East Australian Current. In 2020, researchers at "The Australia Institute" discovered that Sydney was experiencing longer summers and shorter winters in recent decades, compared to those in the 1950s and 1960s. Since the early 1990s, Western Sydney has experienced more intense summer heatwaves than coastal Sydney, with maximum temperatures exceeding those of coastal Sydney by up to . Moreover, since the early 2020s, Sydney's summers have become more humid due to global warming, which result in sea temperatures being above normal.
Seasons.
Summer.
Summer is generally warm to hot, and often humid (particularly in late summer). The ultraviolet index rating averages at 12, but can reach 13 in the midst of the season, which may lead to skin damage among those having light skin.
Sydney can receive hot, dry northwesterly winds from the Outback that make the temperatures soar above . This happens after the northwesterlies are carried entirely over the continental landmass, not picking up additional moisture from a body of water and retaining most of their heat. On these occasions, the city can experience the fury of the desert climate, although they are often ended with a southerly buster, which is a windy, shallow cold front or a sea breeze that sweeps up from the southeast abruptly cooling the temperature. At times, it may be accompanied by a thunderstorm and drizzle, and it may keep the temperatures cool the following few days as well.
In the Sydney central business district, an average of 15 days a year have temperatures of more than and 3 days with temperatures over . In contrast, western suburbs such as Liverpool and Penrith have 41 and 67 days with temperatures above , 10 and 19 days above , and, 1 and 4 days above , respectively.
The highest recorded maximum temperature at Sydney Airport was 46.4 °C (115.5 °F), which was on 18 January 2013. The highest recorded maximum temperature at Sydney CBD was recorded on that same day with the temperature climaxing at 45.8 °C (114.4 °F). The highest recorded maximum temperature within Sydney's Metropolitan area was recorded at Penrith with a high of 48.9 °C (120 °F), a Western Sydney suburb, on 4 January 2020. At that time, Penrith was the hottest place on the planet and the hottest temperature recorded within Australia and the Southern Hemisphere for all of 2020.
Autumn.
Late summer conditions usually continue until the last week of March. Most heavy rainfall events usually occur in late summer and early autumn as the subtropical ridge of high pressure, which rotates counterclockwise, is to the south of Australia and therefore give way for moist easterlies from the Tasman Sea and as well as low pressure systems to penetrate the region.
The transition from late summer to autumn is gradual, with noticeably cooler and crisper conditions taking in effect by around mid-April. Temperatures in autumn are usually consistent and stable, lacking any extremes that tend to be experienced in spring and summer.
The lowest maximum temperature in autumn is , recorded on 24 May 1904. The highest maximum autumn temperature ever recorded at Sydney Airport was recorded on 9 March 1983, with the temperature peaking at . Though the hottest autumn day ever recorded in Sydney's metropolitan area was on 6 March 1938 when Richmond RAAF hit .
Winter.
Winter in central Sydney tends to be mild where the lows rarely drop below , mainly due to proximity to the ocean. Furthermore, Sydney CBD (Observatory Hill) has never recorded frost. In the far west (in places such as Richmond and Camden), the diurnal range can be relatively great, particularly in late winter. In the west, Liverpool and Richmond have 4 and 38 nights, respectively, where temperatures dip below . On average, only 1 night in Liverpool and 17 nights in Richmond have lows that go below . In such cold mornings, frost can form in the far western suburbs. The lowest maximum temperature in Liverpool was , recorded on 28 July 1981.
Sydney receives around 15 days of fog annually, which occurs in winter mornings; some can be thick enough to divert planes and cancel ferry services. During late winter, warm dry westerly winds which dominate may raise the maximum temperatures as high as in some instances. As the subtropical ridge is north of Sydney in mid-to-late winter, it picks up dry westerlies from the continent's interior because of its anticlockwise rotation, thus producing more sunny days in the region. 
The lowest recorded minimum at Observatory Hill was on 22 June 1932, while the coldest in the Sydney metropolitan area was , in Richmond. The lowest recorded maximum temperature at Observatory Hill was . Although not usually considered a suburb of Sydney, Picton, a town in the Macarthur Region of Sydney, recorded a low of on 16 July 1970.
Sydney's warmest winter day was recorded on 30 August 2024 at Sydney Airport when the temperature hit at 2:48 PM.
Spring.
Early spring is rapidly transitional and erratic. Cool conditions from late winter may continue in September, but due to the drastic transition, temperatures above can also be expected in that month, including the odd thunderstorm. By November, summery conditions begin, albeit with relatively low humidity. Because the subtropical ridge lies to the north of Sydney this time of the year, it will bring westerly winds from the interior that produce mostly sunny conditions, with relatively low dewpoints. Extreme, changeable and inconsistent temperatures are much more prevalent in spring than other seasons. Furthermore, the diurnal range is higher in this season than it is in autumn.
The lowest maximum temperature in spring was , recorded on 8 September 1869. 9am relative humidity is the lowest in the year during spring, ranging from 58% to 68%, with early spring receiving lower figures. The highest maximum Spring temperature ever recorded at Sydney Airport was on 25 November 1982, when the temperature eclipsed at . Sydney CBD also recorded its hottest spring day on this same day, peaking at . The highest spring temperature recorded in Sydney's Metropolitan area was registered at Richmond on 23 November 2014, peaking at .
Warm and cool periods.
The Bureau of Meteorology reported in 2011 that 2002 to 2005 had been the warmest years in Sydney since records began in 1859. 2004 saw an average daily maximum temperature of , 2005 of , 2002 of , and 2003 of . The average daily maximum between 1859 and 2004 was . Seven (of the ten) warmest years in 151 years of recordkeeping have occurred in the ten years between 2001 and 2010, with this decade being the warmest on record for minimum temperatures.
The Bureau of Meteorology reported that the summer of 2007–08 was the coolest in 11 years, the wettest in six years, the cloudiest in 16 years, and one of only three summers in recorded history to lack a maximum temperature above . The Bureau of Meteorology reported that 2009 was a warm year. The average annual daytime temperature at Observatory Hill was , which is above the historical annual average. This ranks as the seventh highest annual average maximum temperature since records commenced in 1859. 2010 was the equal fourth warmest year on record for Sydney, with an average maximum of , which was above the historical annual average.
Climate models in 2014 suggested that sea temperatures off Sydney are decades away from becoming "tropical". A scenario of increasing CO2 emissions proposed winter sea surface temperatures will consistently exceed between 2020 and 2030, and summer sea surface temperatures will consistently surpass between 2040 and 2060.
July 2017 to June 2018 in southeastern Australia proved to be the hottest financial year on record with maximum temperatures being the warmest on record and minimums above average. The warmest year on record was 2016, with a mean temperature of degrees. Sydney's 2017 mean temperature of degrees was degrees above the long term average and the second highest value in 158 years of records. The 2020-21 summer was the coolest in a decade due to La Nina's influence.
Microclimate.
The region of Sydney is subject to phenomena typical of a microclimate, namely in late spring and summer, where the western suburbs are hotter than the Sydney CBD by due to urban sprawl exacerbating the urban heat island effect and less exposure to mitigating sea breezes which cool down Sydney's eastern edge and fail to move inland. The dramatic temperature difference between coastal and inland areas is caused by a combination of desert-warmed air from central Australia reaching the west, and as well as density of housing, lack of vegetation or open spaces, and the Blue Mountains which help trap the hot air.
When it is at Bondi for instance, the temperature will be around just west of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, around near Parramatta and as much as inland. Such extreme temperature differences in the Sydney metropolitan area usually occur in late spring when the western Pacific Ocean is still quite cool and the inland air is warm. Furthermore, within the CBD, heat maps show the area around Central Station (in Haymarket) is warmer than Circular Quay and surrounds, making it the hottest place in the CBD.
According to ecologist Sebastian Pfautsch from the University of Freiburg, in Sydney's hot days there could be discrepancies of up to 22 more days above recorded in urban space compared to a weather station from the Bureau of Meteorology. Because was recorded in Penrith (on 4 January 2020), it will not be unusual to have a reading somewhere nearby, especially if it lacked green space and retained heat to intensify heatwave temperatures. 
Richmond has the second largest overall temperature range recorded in Australia, after Mitchell, Queensland; .
Urban heat island.
A study by the University of Western Australia and RMIT indicated that the western suburbs have a much stronger urban heat island effect than those east of the CBD and that hotter temperatures in the west are human contributed due to solar radiation absorbing materials in black asphalt and dark roofs, anthropogenic heat from cars and less natural environments, thereby creating a "heat dome" that blocks the cooler air from the sea. Greening Australia stated that January mean maximum temperatures in the west have risen at a pace of 0.65 °C per decade, over twice as much as eastern Sydney's 0.28 °C per decade. The OEH warned that further development could cause more exceedingly hot days in the west by 2030.
Urban heat island of the CBD has been efficaciously blocking the cooler air from reaching the inland suburbs because the CBD's "high temperature, is like a wall that stops the sea breeze in its tracks. Over Sydney’s CBD is a heat dome because of the high density of concrete and asphalt. If we want to cool western Sydney and demolish this wall, we need to cool the CBD first", Professor Mattheos Santamouris from UNSW states. He explained that cooling the CBD would reduce the temperature by 1.5 °C in the west and tree coverage could cool down suburban streets by as much as 10 °C (18 °F) in hot days since high-density housing developments and scarce trees trap heat. Waterbodies and open spaces also provide cooling benefits in urban areas.
According to climate researchers, relatively easy modifications such as constructing fountains and water playgrounds could also lower temperatures in the western suburbs. The city now has 3.6% more trees in 2016 than it did in 2009 and Penrith City Council had planned to plant 100,000 trees from August 2018, in addition to planning a large city park, creating a water-sensitive urban design, street shading, and the use of cool materials in its building developments. Furthermore, Parramatta City Council has installed 20 temperature sensors among different tree species in its suburbs to compare how different species can help reduce urban heat.
Precipitation.
Rainfall is slightly higher or dominant during the first half of the year, particularly in late summer and early autumn, when the ocean has peaked its warmth. Rainfall will tend to be lower in the second half of the year when the subtropical ridge is just to the north of the city. Most rain comes mostly from major storms, rarely drizzle, particularly from subtropical lows that bring warm, moist air onshore.
Due to the unpredictability of rain, the wettest and driest months change on a yearly basis. Rain falls on 40% of days, anytime of the year, but usually in January to June. Coastal showers, which are mostly stratiform, occur in post-frontal south-east flow, where they become volatile over the warm ocean near Sydney, thereby setting up an "ocean-effect" (where rainfall is intensified leeward of a waterbody).
Frontal lows frequently affect Sydney in winter, but they are generally dry because such lows remain farther south, and the cold front's passage is connected with a shift from warm and dry northwesterly winds to colder, damp south-westerlies, which lose much of their moisture over the Great Dividing Range. Therefore, the drier winters are due to its rain shadow position on the leeward (eastern) side of the Great Dividing Range, which shield the region from south-westerly cold fronts that arrive from the Southern Ocean.
Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies, from around at Badgerys Creek (in the west) to at Turramurra (the northeast) in the Northern Suburbs, which create an orographic rainfall. The annual evaporation rate for Sydney is , with the rate in the summer being and in winter .
Storms.
East coast lows, which strike from the southeast in the Tasman Sea, bring heavy rainfall typically in autumn to early winter. The precipitation of the low comes from a nimbostratus cloud that dumps as much as of rain for as much as two days. Annually, there are around 40 days with convective thunderstorms, which particularly occur in late spring and summer – Such storms arrive from the west, and normally involve northeasterly winds at the surface.
The western suburbs are more inclined to receive thunderstorms in summer due to the stabilizing effect of a sea breeze in the afternoon near the CBD and Eastern Suburbs. Isolated convective showers form when a cold pool arrives from the southwest, particularly on hot and sultry days. These showers usually come in heavy downpours and can include hail, squalls, and drops in temperature, but they generally pass very quickly. Black nor'easters may bring persistent rainfall for a few consecutive days in the warm months, and Australian northwest cloudbands produce light rainfall in the cool months.
The city is rarely affected by cyclones, although remnants of ex-cyclones do affect the city. The city is prone to severe hailstorms, windstorms, and flash flooding. Scientists have predicted that rainfall will become more unpredictable and temperatures will be on the rise.
In 2011, Sydney recorded its wettest July since 1950, where the CBD recorded of rain that month. 2011 was also the wettest year since records began in 1858. Parts of western Sydney were substantially flooded during the New South Wales 2021 floods, with many areas around Richmond and Windsor submerged in floodwaters. In early 2022, Sydney recorded its wettest start to a year on record with the running annual total being , topping to the same date in 1956 and in 1990, respectively (rainfall data at Sydney Observatory Hill dates back to 1858).
Snowfall.
Snow is extremely rare in Sydney, with significant snowfall being last reported in the Sydney area on 28 June 1836. On that date, it was reported that convicts and British settlers in Hyde Park woke up to snow "nearly deep", with the meteorological table in The Sydney Herald recording that on the morning of the snow the temperature dropped to . The snow event affected trading where sellers were unable to transport goods to markets in the colony. The snowfall occurred at the end of the dalton minimum, a solar cycle period representing low solar activity, where colder temperatures were recorded globally. A keeper of weather observations during that period, T. A. Browne noted:
"The Sydney Morning Herald" reported on the event, saying:
"The Sydney Monitor" reported:
Scant snowfall has been recorded in latter dates:
Drought.
Sydney's winter rainfall is predicted to decrease by 20-35% by the year 2090. The other phenomenon that arises from these long, dry and hot periods is bushfires, which occur frequently in the areas surrounding the city. Water supply is a recurring concern for the city during drought periods.
In 2005 the reservoirs reached an all-time low. Many areas of the city bordering bushland have experienced bushfires, notably in 1994 and 2001–02 — these tend to occur during the spring and summer. Heatwaves, which are regularly occurring in recent years, usually lead to water restrictions and a high risk of bushfires, which sometimes bring a smoky haze to the city. Smog is noticeable on hot days, even without bushfires. The years 2009 and 2010 had dry conditions, according to Bureau of Meteorology.
In September 2013, the combination of dry weather, warm temperatures and strong winds brought early-season bushfires. The summer of 2013-14 was the driest in 72 years. The widespread bushfires in December 2019 affected the western periphery of the city, and the Sydney metropolitan area suffered from dangerous smoky haze for several days throughout the month 2019 was one of Sydney's warmest in 161 years and the driest since 2005, which had a few days of raised dust and as well as declining dam levels.
Wind.
As a whole, the Sydney region is generally the windiest from October to January and calmest from March to June. The windier locations are those by the coast, such as the eastern suburbs. The prevailing winds are seasonal in coastal Sydney; northeasterly sea breezes arriving in the summer provide relief on hot days; in winter and early spring, generally strong and cool winds come from the west or north-west, which are related to large scale synoptic events. Summer winds from the south may be strong (i.e. southerly buster). Spring and autumn winds tend to be variable.
Northeasterlies and easterly sea breezes are dominant from early summer to early autumn, because the anticlockwise-rotating subtropical ridge is to the south of the city where it allows winds from the sea to penetrate. Westerlies are dominant in late winter to mid-spring as the subtropical ridge is just to the north of the city, picking up winds from the interior and blocking easterlies from the sea. Westerly winds in Sydney are intensified when the Roaring forties contract towards the southeastern Australia.
Southerly busters are expected from October to the end of March. They typically look like as if a sheet of cloud is rolled up like a scroll by the advancing wind. The change of wind (in the warm months) is sometimes very sudden, where it may be fresh northeasterly and in ten minutes a southerly gale. Katabatic winds are light, south-westerly drainage winds, akin to land breezes, that occur when air of higher density in the Blue Mountains descends under gravity force into the Sydney metropolitan area and the Hawkesbury Basin, usually during a winter night.
Since Sydney is located on the Great Dividing Range's eastern side, and is thus in its rain shadow, it experiences a föhn-like type of wind, particularly between late autumn and early spring, which is a dry south-westerly that raises the air temperature and provides clear to partly sunny conditions in the lee of the mountains (in this case, the Sydney Basin), after the arrival of a vigorous westerly cold front from the Southern Ocean. In the cool season, these föhn-like winds can be particularly damaging to homes and affect flights.
Air masses.
Sydney is affected by five air mass types throughout the year:
Historical descriptions.
Aboriginal seasons.
The Sydney Basin is in the traditional lands of the Dharawal people. The Dharawal describe six seasons for their country which extends from the southern shores of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) to the northern shores of the Shoalhaven River, and from the eastern shores of the Wollondilly River system to the eastern seaboard.
European settlers.
On 18 July 1791, Watkin Tench described a particularly cold morning for Sydney's standards, in the area that is now Carramar, near a waterbody that was most likely to be Prospect Creek. Tench carried a thermometer in the area to record the unusually cool temperatures, in which he stated that "a degree of cold for the latitude of the place that I think myself bound to transcribe it." Such cold mornings can be attributed to the The Little Ice Age, which extended from the 16th to the 19th centuries, and would have affected south-east Australia's climate in the late 18th century, which was at the time when Europeans first colonized Australia.
On his diary entry regarding the cold conditions, he wrote:
Notwithstanding, Tench stated that Sydney's climate at that time was still warm enough to sustain plant life all year round: "Nor will this surprise, if the genial influence of the climate be considered. Placed in a latitude where the beams of the sun in the dreariest season are sufficiently powerful for many hours of the day to dispense warmth and nutrition, the progress of vegetation never is at a stand." 
In December 1791, Lieutenant General Watkin Tench described the difference between the climate of Sydney CBD and inland areas such as Parramatta, which included the microclimate, the diurnal range, and as well as a record of snowflakes:
In 1791–92, Tench described the summers as uncomfortably hot, where settlers felt "A temporary sickness at the stomach, accompanied with lassitude and headache". The heat was reported to be "occasioned by the wind blowing over immense deserts...in a north-west direction from Port Jackson". The heat attested in that summer was so intense that it killed bats and parrots in the area. 
In 1819, British explorer William Wentworth describes Sydney's climate as being pleasant, though he focuses particularly on the summer heat:
Seasons.
Below, Wentworth describes Sydney's seasonal and annual weather patterns in analytical detail:

Liaquat National Hospital

The Liaquat National Hospital is located at Stadium Road, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.
History.
Soon after Independence the Red Cross Fete Committee, which was chaired by Syed Wajid Ali, raised about PKR 800,000 through meena bazaars organized under the guidance of Rana Liaquat Ali Khan. At a meeting chaired by Khan, the committee decided to establish a national hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Malik Ghulam Muhammad, the governor-general of Pakistan, laid the foundation stone of the hospital on 23 February 1953. After completion, president of Pakistan, Iskander Mirza, inaugurated it on 16 October 1958.
In memory of Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan, the first Prime Minister of Pakistan who was assassinated in 1951, the national hospital was renamed later as Liaquat National Hospital.
Syed Wajid Ali was selected as the president of a committee of citizens, philanthropists, technocrats and government functionaries on November 5, 1958, and remained so till his death in 2008.
In 1978, the institute entered into the field of education. Today, it plays a role as a leading postgraduate medical centre having a school of nursing, a school of physiotherapy and rehabilitation, a College of Medical Laboratory Technology, and offers technical courses in a spectrum of services.
Now, the hospital has 700 beds with 32 specialty services, providing diagnostic and therapeutic facilities. The hospital has a residency training program, representing a majority of the existing disciplines.
Recognition.
Recognised for fellowship by the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan, including disciplines which are also recognised by the Royal Colleges in the UK.
Departments.
The hospital has MRI machines, pathology laboratory facilities, additional Executive II and III Wards, CCU, MICU, dialysis machines and ventilators. An operation theatre, intensive care unit. and transplant unit complex are under construction.

The River Detectives

The River Detectives were a folk rock duo from Craigneuk in Wishaw, Scotland. The duo, formed in 1985, comprised Sam Corry (vocals, guitar, harmonica) and Dan O'Neill (vocals, guitar, drums). The River Detectives have released three albums to date and had a UK top 75 hit with their song, "Chains".
History.
The band played their first show at Jack Daniel's Pub in Motherwell on 18 August 1986. In 1988 the band toured extensively in Scotland and attracted the interest of the Warner Bros. Records label, becoming the first Scottish band to sign for them in over a decade. Shortly afterwards, the duo moved to Glasgow to pen the songs for their debut album, "Saturday Night Sunday Morning". The album spawned the UK top 75 hit "Chains".
The band recruited Van Morrison's backing group for the follow-up album, "Elvis Has Left the Building", released in 1992. The album's title is a reference to the state of music at the time of the record's release when computer technology and the rise of the DJ were rampant and conventional performers were becoming peripheral. After the album's release, the band relocated to Ireland, where they wrote and toured extensively and guested on a number of records. By 1996, after playing the Splashy Fen festival in the Natal Province, the band received further invitations to tour in the country and relocated to Durban for a year before returning to the UK in 2000 to take a break.
The duo reunited when Corry asked O'Neil for assistance in finishing lyrics to a new song, "Capetown to Glasgow". This song featured on their third release, "King of the Ghost Train Ride", which was released on Neontetra Records in 2005.
The duo played a full band set at the O2 ABC in Glasgow on 28 September 2009, which they announced during the show was their farewell gig.

Don Johnson (pitcher)

Donald Roy Johnson (November 12, 1926 – February 10, 2015) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher. The , right-hander was signed by the New York Yankees before the 1944 season and played for the Yankees (1947, 1950), St. Louis Browns (1950–51), Washington Senators (1951–52), Chicago White Sox (1954), Baltimore Orioles (1955), and San Francisco Giants (1958).
Johnson made his major league debut on April 20, 1947, starting game 2 of a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. He was the winning pitcher in the 10-inning, 3–2 Yankee victory, and went on to have a 4–3 record for the 1947 World Series Champions.
Johnson pitched both as a starter and in relief during his long, well-traveled career. His best season statistically was in 1954 with the White Sox. He won 8, lost 7, had a 3.12 earned run average, and finished in the American League Top ten in games pitched, saves, and shutouts.
Career totals include a record of 27–38 in 198 games, 70 games started, 17 complete games, 5 shutouts, 62 games finished, 12 saves, and an ERA of 4.78. He had a rather high WHIP of 1.580 in 631 innings pitched.
Johnson led the International League with 156 strikeouts and a 2.67 ERA while playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1953. He was voted the IL's most valuable pitcher in 1957.

Leslie Fry

Leslie Fry (February 16, 1882 – July 15, 1970), sometimes referred to as L. Fry, was the pen name of Paquita Louise de Shishmareff (born Louise A. Chandor). She was an American antisemitic, pro-fascist author, who is primarily known for "Waters Flowing Eastward" (1931), a book which asserts that Jews were to blame for both capitalism and Bolshevism, and that it was primarily certain Jews who started World War I. She alleged that certain Freemasons were involved as well. She postulated that the ultimate aim of these particular Jews and Freemasons was "World Domination". These conclusions were based in part on her study of the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion".
Called "the most active fascist in southern California", Fry was also a paid Nazi agent who worked to cultivate Nazism in the United States. She attempted to unify various American fascist movements.
Family background.
Louise A. Chandor was born in Paris, France, the daughter of U.S. citizens John Arthur Chandor and Elizabeth (Red) Fry Ralston.
Louise's mother, Elizabeth (Red) Fry, married William Chapman Ralston (1826–1875) on May 20, 1858, in San Francisco. Soon after their marriage, Ralston rose to become a San Francisco banking and real estate magnate. He became a living legend, acclaimed as "the man who built San Francisco." However, the marriage was unhappy, and ended in tragedy on August 27, 1875, when Ralston drowned while swimming in San Francisco Bay. After a preliminary, partial settlement of her husband's estate, Elizabeth Ralston embarked in December 1875 on a steamer to Europe, intending to settle in Paris with her children. It is reported that she first met John Arthur Chandor en route, and that he soon joined her in Paris, even though he had been recently married in New York City. It is not known if Chandor and Elizabeth Ralston married, but their friendship resulted in the birth of Louise A. Chandor (pen-name: Leslie Fry) in Paris on February 16, 1882.
Louise's paternal grandparents were Lasslo (Laslo) Philip Chandor (originally: László Fülöp Sándor) (1815/1817 – October 7, 1894) and Laura Mannabourg (September 28, 1827 – April 14, 1878). Lasslo was an Austrian-Hungarian adventurer, inventor and businessman, who had emigrated to the U.S. in the 1840s. As a founder and director of the Mineral Lighting Company in New York City, and inventor holding several patents, Lasslo had a keen interest in improving city lighting systems. In the early-to-mid 1860s he obtained four lucrative contracts to improve the public lighting of St. Petersburg, Russia. It is reported that the profits from the contracts, and the profits from his inventions used to fulfill them, made Lasslo a millionaire. Lasslo obtained the contracts by cultivating business relationships with U.S. diplomats in the administrations of Presidents James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln, and Andrew Johnson, who were involved in U.S.-Russia trade relations during this time. During the 1870s and 1880s, Lasslo was involved in the burgeoning oil and gas industries in Russia. Lasslo's son John Arthur Chandor (1850–1909), who was Louise's father, was also involved in various business activities in Russia.
Early life in Europe and Russia, 1882–1917.
Louise spent considerable time living in St. Petersburg while her grandfather and father were engaged in business activities there. On May 26, 1906 (Old Style) in St. Petersburg, Louise married Captain (later Colonel) Feodor Ivanovich Shishmarev (born August 16, 1876) (Old Style), an officer in the Russian Imperial Army. The Shishmarev family had been a Russian noble family for centuries. It is believed that Feodor was murdered in 1917 by Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution, but before his murder he had the foresight to send Louise (who was now using her married name 'Paquita Louise de Shishmareff') with their two sons (Kyrill and Misha), and the family fortune, out of the country to safety. During the Bolshevik Revolution, Paquita and her sons moved to Tiflis, in the Transcaucasian SFSR, where they lived under the protection of the American consulate.
Activities in the United States and Europe, 1917–1970.
In the mid-summer of 1917 Paquita and her sons left Tiflis and traveled to the eastern Russian port city of Vladivostok, where they boarded the steamship S. S. Goentoer bound for San Francisco, California. They arrived August 31.
According to the 1920 U. S. Federal Census records, in 1920 Paquita and her son Misha (Michael) (listed under the surname "Deshishmareft" in the records) were living in Mamaroneck (Westchester County), New York, while her son Kyril (listed as "Keera De Shismareff" in the records) was attending Mount Tamalpais Military Academy (in San Rafael, Marin County, California). It is believed that Paquita moved back to California about 1926. She was associated with fascist political circles during this period. Her wealth allowed her to financially support right-wing nationalists.[10]
Paquita met Henry Ford in or around 1920, and presented him with a copy of the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion". She conceived the "Protocols" as part of a conspiracy according to which a group led by the "cultural Zionist" Asher Ginzberg plotted world domination. However, at the time Ginzberg merely supported an international Jewish cultural and political revival, not the planning and formation of an actual Jewish state.
Antisemitic writer and Nazi ideologist Ernst Graf zu Reventlow named Fry as his source for his own view that Ginzberg was the author of the "Protocols". After Philip Graves provided evidence in "The Times" of London that the "Protocols" were in reality a composite document which, for the most part, had been constructed/plagiarised from a variety of other writings which had been published previously to the appearance of the "Protocols", Reventlow published his support for Fry's theory in the periodical "La Vieille France". Ginzberg's supporters sued Reventlow, who was forced to retract his allegations and pay damages.
Strongly opposed to Roosevelt's New Deal, Fry argued that it represented "the transformation of the Constitutional form of American government into that of the Kahal, or Jewish form of government. It has been called the New Deal and the Jew Deal. Both are correct and synonymous."
Fry was involved in various fascist organisations of the 1930s, and founded the nationalist and isolationist "Christian Free Press", "an anti-Semitic newspaper modeled after Germany's infamous Der Sturmer". She joined forces with Henry Douglas Allen (1879–1961) in a failed attempt to revitalize the Ku Klux Klan. She also made failed attempts to unify American fascist movements. Documents found by San Diego police in Allen's briefcase in 1938 implicated Fry as a paid Nazi agent, but she escaped prosecution at the time. However, she later became estranged from Allen and accused him of misappropriating money from her.
In 1940, Fry fled to fascist Italy, but returned the U.S. after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1943, she was indicted for sedition as part of the Great Sedition Trial, albeit the charges were dropped due to a lack of evidence. However, Fry, who'd been interned on Ellis Island upon her return to the United States, remained in custody until the end of the war.
Origin of the "Protocols" according to "Waters Flowing Eastward".
Fry's major work, "Waters Flowing Eastward" (1931), attempted to prove that the "Protocols" were part of a plot to destroy Christian civilization. The apparent conflict between Communism and Capitalism was a smoke-screen for Jewish domination, as outlined in the "Protocols". The claim repeated by many authors that the "Protocols" first came to light in 1884 via Justine Glinka, was originally put forth by Fry in the 1st edition (1931) of "Waters Flowing Eastward", in a chapter of the book titled "How the Protocols Came to Russia".
According to Fry's account, Justine Glinka (1836–1916), the daughter of Russian diplomat Dmitry Glinka (1808–1883), was endeavouring (in the early to mid-1880s) to serve her country (Russia) by obtaining political information in Paris, which she forwarded to General Orgevskii. In 1884 a Jewish Freemason named Joseph Schorst (alias of Théodore Joseph Schapiro) sold Justine a manuscript copy of the "Protocols" (written in French) for 2,500 francs. Fry believed that Schorst had smuggled this copy of the "Protocols" out of the archives of one of the Mizraïm Masonic Lodges in Paris. According to records in the archives of the Sûreté (French Secret Police), Schorst eventually fled to Egypt, where he was murdered. This manuscript of the "Protocols" then supposedly found its way (through a very convoluted and questionable route) into the hands of Sergei Nilus, who was the first person to publish it in its entirety (in 1905) under a single cover.
"Occult Theocrasy".
Fry and her close friend Edith Starr Miller (Lady Queenborough) (1887–1933) spent about 10 years (1922–1931) as the leaders of a secretive international research group which they named the "International League for Historical Research". The purpose of this group was to identify (and clarify the interconnections between) the most important secret societies existing at that time in Europe, the United States, and in the Middle East. They detailed their findings in "Occult Theocrasy" (2 vols.) (Chatou, France: British American Press, 1931–1933), a work whose publication was completed shortly after Edith's death. This work is now widely regarded as a "conspiracy classic." "Occult Theocrasy" summarizes what was known at that time about the organizations and secret societies which collectively form what is now referred to, variously, as the Cabal, the Illuminati, the One World Government, the Secret World Government, or the New World Order. Although "Occult Theocrasy" is not an authoritative work in the strict sense – some sections of it are vastly more informative and candid than others – nevertheless, as a whole, the work was more comprehensive, up-to-date, and revealing in its subject-matter than any other similar work available in the English language at that time. The work contains overt antisemitic elements and attributes much of world history to a conspiracy of Jews. It gives credence to the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and has two chapters that express praise for the mission of the Ku Klux Klan. To its credit, most of the source information for "Occult Theocrasy" is listed in the book's bibliography. The work also features a brief occult glossary, and a detailed index.
Politico-Occult-Judaeo-Masonry Chart.
Fry compiled an elaborate chart called the "Politico-Occult-Judaeo-Masonry Chart" (1940, by L. Fry), This presents a summary (in chart form) of all the most important information which was published in "Occult Theocrasy". This chart attempts to display the interconnections between all the organizations which Fry and Lady Queenborough claim were/are involved in the alleged Jewish masterplan for world domination. The chart consists of a sheet of paper (measuring approximately 23" X 18"), printed on both sides. On the chart Fry illustrates how the Jewish masterplan is linked to various Judaic, Masonic, Occult, and World-Political organizations, such as the Bavarian Order of the Illuminati, founded by Adam Weishaupt (1748–1830) on May 1, 1776, and the League of Nations.

Roland Camberton

Roland Camberton (1921–1965) was a British writer whose real name was Henry Cohen. He won the 1951 Somerset Maugham Award, given to authors under the age of 35, for his novel "Scamp". The book had earlier received a merciless review in the "Times Literary Supplement" upon publication in late 1950: 
The book is written from the standpoint of the "bum": that bearded and corduroyed figure who may be seen crouching over a half of bitter in the corner of a Bloomsbury "pub"; it is ostensibly concerned with the rise and fall of a short-lived literary review, but Mr. Camberton, who appears to be devoid of any narrative gift, makes this an excuse for dragging in disconnectedly and to little apparent purpose a series of thinly disguised local or literary celebrities. Πο
The following year, he published "Rain on the Pavements". A novel reflecting Jewish life in Hackney during the thirties, this book received a much more positive review (this one from Julian Symons). Camberton then vanished off the literary map. He does not appear to have published any books after 1951. Indeed, few details of his life are available, and there is no mention of him whatsoever in "The Times" archives. The writer Iain Sinclair has described him in an interview as a "Hackney writer". He did, indeed, attend Hackney Downs School (formerly The Grocers' Company's School) until 1938 and two poems by him were published in the School Magazine (The Review). He was buried under his birth name, Henry Cohen, in Rainham Jewish Cemetery in 1965.
In August 2008 Iain Sinclair wrote a long piece on Camberton for "The Guardian" in which he reveals much of his research, including the story of Cohen's early death and the existence of a daughter. Both "Scamp" and "Rain on the Pavements" were republished by New London Editions in 2010 with reproductions of the original covers by the artist John Minton.
In 2021, the 'TLS' in a retrospective said, "he vanished off the literary map and died, forgotten, in the mid-1960s, aged just forty-four. His centenary this month is a good opportunity to reassess this unfairly neglected writer."

Osama Eldawoody

Osama Eldawoody is a US citizen with a self-proclaimed nuclear engineering degree who has worked as a paid New York City Police Department informant to work undercover in Mosques in the New York metropolitan area. In 2004, his work broke up an alleged terrorist plot by Shahawar Matin Siraj and James Elshafay to blow up the 34th Street–Herald Square station of the New York City Subway, and the Macy's Herald Square Department Store, one of the largest in the world. Court documents and statements from Siraj were inconsistent with Eldawoody's testimony. However, in both instances, his methodology were reported to include entrapping the potential "terrorists" with aggressive and misleading tactics. Some have claimed he created the terrorist plots himself to entrap young and vulnerable people in order to get the FBI and NYPD payments and recognition, and that there were no credible terrorist threats to begin with.

Roger Brown (psychologist)

Roger William Brown (April 14, 1925 – December 11, 1997) was an American psychologist. He was known for his work in social psychology and in children's language development.
Brown taught at Harvard University from 1952 until 1957 and from 1962 until 1994, and at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1957 until 1962. His scholarly books include "Words and Things: An Introduction to Language" (1958), "Social Psychology" (1965), "Psycholinguistics" (1970), "A First Language: The Early Stages" (1973), and "Social Psychology: The Second Edition" (1985). He authored numerous journal articles and book chapters.
He was the doctoral adviser or a post-doctoral mentor of many researchers in child language development and psycholinguistics, including Jean Berko Gleason, Susan Ervin-Tripp, Camile Hanlon, Dan Slobin, Ursula Bellugi, Courtney Cazden, Richard F. Cromer, David McNeill, Eric Lenneberg, Colin Fraser, Eleanor Rosch (Heider), Melissa Bowerman, Steven Pinker, Kenji Hakuta, Jill de Villiers, and Peter de Villiers. A "Review of General Psychology" survey, published in 2002, ranked Brown as the 34th-most cited psychologist of the 20th century.
Education and career.
Born in Detroit, Brown earned an undergraduate psychology degree in 1948 and a Ph.D. in 1952 from the University of Michigan. He started his career in 1952 as an instructor and then assistant professor of psychology at Harvard University. In 1957 he left Harvard for an associate professorship at MIT, and became a full professor of psychology there in 1960. In 1962, he returned to Harvard as a full professor, and served as chair of the Department of Social Relations from 1967 to 1970. From 1974 until his retirement in 1994, he held the title of John Lindsley Professor of Psychology in Memory of William James.
Research and writing.
Roger Brown's research and teaching focused on social psychology, the relationship between language and thought, and the linguistic development of children. The clarity, directness, and humor of his scholarly writing are often praised; Pinker describes him as "perhaps the best writer in psychology since James himself".
Brown's book "Words and Things: An Introduction to Language" (1957) examines the mutual influence of thought and language, described as "the first book on the psychology of language coming out of the cognitive revolution". His writing in this area became an inspiration for much work in the relation between language and cognition, including Eleanor Rosch (Heider)'s work on color names and color memory and Steven Pinker's 1994 book "The Language Instinct".
Brown taught social psychology and published his first textbook, "Social Psychology", in 1965. The book was completely rewritten and published in 1986 as "Social Psychology: The Second Edition". Brown also wrote an introductory textbook on psychology, co-authored with his colleague Richard Herrnstein. Pinker noted that these two books "live in publishing infamy as a lesson of what happens to textbooks that are unconventional, sophisticated, and thought-provoking: they don't sell."
In the late 1950s, Brown and then his student Jean Berko Gleason undertook the first experimental studies on children's language development. During the late 1960s, Brown and several junior colleagues, including Ursula Bellugi, Colin Fraser, and Richard F. Cromer, undertook a landmark study of the linguistic development of children, published in "A First Language: The Early Stages". This book chronicled the language development of three English-speaking children over several years, and provided an in-depth analysis of the early stages of first language acquisition. This analysis of five stages of language development, determined by structures used and by mean length of utterance (MLU), continues to be used in the field today. The original transcriptions of the three children's conversations, along with materials from many other children speaking a wide variety of languages, is available from the Child Language Data Exchange, founded by Brian MacWhinney (Carnegie Mellon University) and Catherine Snow (Harvard).
Other important works by Brown include his 1976 paper on "Flashbulb Memories", concerning people's memories of what they were doing at the time they heard about major traumatic events such as the JFK assassination. The breadth of his interests is seen in the papers reprinted in his 1970 book "Psycholinguistics", which includes work with David McNeill on the 'tip of the tongue state', a study with Albert Gilman of the social factors involved in choosing familiar versus polite second-person pronouns ("tu, vous") in languages like French and Spanish, and a review of the novel "Lolita" by Harvard colleague Vladimir Nabokov.
Brown was known for the grace with which he treated and referred to his colleagues, whether junior or senior. An example of this is found in his brief autobiography: "Jerome Bruner, then as now, had the gift of providing intellectual stimulus, but also the rarer gift of giving his colleagues the strong sense that psychological problems of great antiquity were on the verge of solution that afternoon by the group there assembled."
Early research on children's language acquisition
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Brown and his student at the time, Jean Berko Gleason, undertook the first experimental studies on children's language development. The study published by Brown and Gleason in 1960 "Word Association and the Acquisition of Grammar" attempts to answer whether children's gradual tendency to make word associations based on parts-of-speech is evidence for the maturation of the human brain to comprehend syntax of the English language. The experiment identified that children produce heterogeneous parts-of-speech answers (words thematically related) to prompted words and adults tended to produce homogenous parts of speech answers (syntactically related) to the same prompts. In order to clarify this observation, Brown also conducted a "Usage Test" in which he used nonsense words in specific grammatical contexts and asked subjects what they understood the words to mean. Younger children answered in a similar fashion to the word association test, making thematic assumptions of the nonsense words, while adults again made grammatical assumptions to word's meaning. He concludes that based on children's increasing rate of homogeneous parts-of-speech answers with age in conjunction with the answers they give to the "Usage Test" are two ways children can be observed to develop an appreciation of English syntax. Thus, supporting a theory that language acquisition is a maturational process.
Linguistic Determinism and the Part of Speech (1957)
In 1957, Brown sought to figure out how language constitutes perception and thought of one's surroundings. Specifically, he took a critical look at how the meanings we assign to parts of speech (e.g., verbs naming actions and nouns naming substances) constitute differences in cognition among people. Brown focused on the semantic definition of a noun, which is known as a person, place or thing. The problem that he identified is that there is no definitive meaning of what a thing is, hence, Brown explained that nouns may be the key to understanding how parts of speech affect cognition. He hypothesized that nouns “tend to have” semantic characteristics contrary to verbs and that speakers pick up these semantic inconsistencies when learning English. To test the hypothesis, an evaluation of nouns and verbs used by children learning English and English speaking adults was completed to identify whether or not the nouns and verbs used had clear semantic differences. The examination showed that child use of nouns and verbs had clear semantic distinctions as opposed to adults. With this result, Brown also questioned if children were conscious of their distinct semantics. This question was answered through a test. An image association experiment performed on children showed that they use the part of speech of a word (whether a word is a noun, adjective, etc.) as a hint to the word's definition. In essence, children are in fact aware of semantic implications while engaging in parts of speech. Brown concluded that semantic distinctions of the parts of speech affect cognition and that different languages and their respective parts of speech may be determinants of varying cognitive operations for those who use said languages.
Frequency-Brevity Principle (1958)
In his “How Shall a Thing Be Called?” article, Brown wrote about how objects have many names, but often share a common name. He proposed the frequency-brevity principle, by which he theorized that children use words that are shorter in length because shorter words are more common for objects in the English language—for example, referring to a dog as "dog" and not "animal". He elaborated on the frequency-brevity principle and how it may be violated (for example, referring to a pineapple as "pineapple" and not "fruit"). He further argued that children progress from concrete naming to more abstract categorizations as they age.
The Pronouns of Power and Solidarity (1960)
In 1960, Brown and Albert Gilman conducted a questionnaire in order to gain a deeper understanding of the pronoun “you” across five languages. These five languages studied include Italian, German, Spanish, English, and French. The questionnaire presents participants with a scenario in which they must select the appropriate pronoun when speaking to others belonging to different social class, familiarities and ages. The results indicate participants shift between different pronouns in order to best compliment those they are speaking to. Brown and Gilman theorized that there are two different styles of “you,” one to indicate a power dynamic, and the other to indicate a solidarity dynamic. They termed the pronoun of solidarity “T”, and the pronoun of power “V” to make for clarity and understanding. The varied use of T and V is used to implicate different relationships between those in conversation based on factors such as age, social class, similarity, familiarity, respect, and expression of mood.
The Tip of The Tongue Phenomenon (1966)
To test the Tip of the Tongue phenomenon empirically, Brown and David McNeill conducted a study in which they asked participants to look over a list of words and definitions and then listen to the definition one of the words on the list. Those in the “tip of the tongue” state were asked to fill out a chart assessing the related words that they are able to come up with. Brown and McNeill were able to identify two types of recall: abstract and partial, that participants exhibited when attempting to remember the target words. Abstract recall relies on the number of syllables in the target word or the location of stressed syllables in the word while partial recall relies on the number of letters the target word.
Awards.
Brown was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1966–67. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1963) and the National Academy of Sciences (1972). In 1971 he received the Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award of the American Psychological Association, in 1973, the G. Stanley Hall Prize in Developmental Psychology of the American Association, and in 1984, the Fyssen International Prize in Cognitive Science. He also was awarded several honorary doctorates.
Personal life.
Roger Brown was born in Detroit, one of four brothers. His family, like many others, was hit hard by the Depression. He attended Detroit public schools, and began undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan, but World War II interrupted his education. He joined the Navy during his freshman year, and was accepted into the V-12 program, which included midshipman training at Columbia University, and served as an ensign in the U.S. Navy. During his time in the navy, he became interested in psychology. With the help of the GI BIll, he completed his university education after the war. Brown became a dedicated opera fan, with a particular admiration for Metropolitan Opera soprano Renata Scotto.
During his time at the University of Michigan, Brown met Albert Gilman (died December 22, 1989), later a Shakespeare scholar and a professor of English at Boston University. Gilman and Brown were partners for over 40 years until Gilman's death from lung cancer in 1989. Brown's sexual orientation and his relationship with Gilman were known to a few of his closest friends, and he served on the editorial board of "The Journal of Homosexuality" from 1985, but he did not come out publicly until 1989. Brown chronicled his personal life with Gilman and after Gilman's death in his memoir. Brown died in 1997, and is buried next to Gilman in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His obituary in "Cognition", written by his friend Steven Pinker, says that Brown's "final years were also marked by declining health. He was stricken with prostate cancer, epilepsy, arthritis, cellulitis, spinal stenosis (which made it hard for him to walk or stand up straight), and heart disease"; it also says that Brown "planned his suicide to avoid a life of further pain and physical decline."

William F. Woodington

William Frederick Woodington (10 February 1806 – 24 December 1893) was an English painter and sculptor.
Life.
Woodington was born in Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire (possibly at the Three
Tuns in High Street), and was articled at the age of 12 to an engraver Robert William Sievier (1794–1865). When Sievier turned his hand to sculpture four years later, Woodington followed suit.
He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1825, was appointed curator of the Academy's School of Sculpture in 1851, and was elected an Associate in 1876.
Woodington died at Brixton Hill aged 87 in 1893 and was buried at West Norwood.
His son, also called William Frederick Woodington, (1830–1922) was similarly a sculptor. They worked together on the bronze panel of Battle of the Nile and plinth of Nelson's Column. William Jr. also worked on statues for St Basil, St Gregory, St Chrysostom and St Anthanasias in the dome of St Paul's Cathedral and the memorial to Lord Napier of Magdala in the crypt.

AHDB Potatoes

AHDB Potatoes, previously known as the Potato Council, is a trade organisation focusing on the promotion of the potato industry in Great Britain. Previously an independent non-departmental public body, it has been a division of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board since 1 April 2008.
AHDB Potatoes' grower levy is £42.62 per hectare, and the purchaser levy is £0.1858 per tonne. Its main base is at Stoneleigh Park in Warwickshire, and there is a Scottish office in Newbridge in Midlothian and an experimental station (SBEU) in Sutton Bridge in Lincolnshire.
Its publication is the "Potato Weekly", which mainly lists current prices of potatoes per tonne. It visits agricultural shows.
History.
Set up to replace the Potato Marketing Board, the Potato Council was originally known as the Potato Industry Development Council and then the British Potato Council until April 2008.
Potato Marketing Board.
The organisation was originally established in 1934 as the Potato Marketing Board by the "Potato Marketing Scheme (Approval) Order (Great Britain) 1933", under powers given to potato producers under the Agricultural Marketing Acts of 1931 and 1933. The scheme was mainly set up to put an end to the unstable market conditions of the 1920s and 1930s. The board was to regulate the marketing of the industry by registering producers and prohibit sales by unregistered producers.
Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, the Ministry of Food took control of all agricultural production. With the passing of the "Potato Marketing Scheme 1933 (Modification and Suspension) Order 1939", all of the board's activities were suspended.
In 1955, the "Potato Marketing Scheme (Approval) Order 1955" repealed the previous order and created a new, similar entity. Amendments to the scheme commenced in 1962, 1971, 1976, 1985, 1987 and 1990. The board was largely producer-elected; however, it had a few ministerial appointees. Many of its powers were delegated to committees such as the Executive Committee and the Retailers' Committee. In 1958, the board bought the former RAF base, RAF Sutton Bridge in Lincolnshire, and set up an agricultural experiment station, now known as Sutton Bridge Crop Storage Research.
British Potato Council.
In 1997, under the "Potato Industry Development Council Order 1997", the name was changed to the "British Potato Council". It levied farmers under powers originally delegated from the Industrial Organisation and Development Act 1947 but now through powers granted to its parent organisation. It was also funded through the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD) and the National Assembly for Wales Agriculture Department (NAWAD).
In 2005, a report by Daniel Lewis from the Efficiency in Government Unit (jointly sponsored by the Centre for Policy Studies and the Economic Research Council), called "The Essential Guide to British Quangos", looked into the role of quangos in British politics and potential efficiency savings that could have been made. The report named the British Potato Council as one of the nine "most useless quangos". In 2008, it was merged with other similar levy-funded organisations to form the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), where it operates as a specialist division focused on the potato industry.
In 2007, the British Potato Council received £6 million in funding from British farmers. Despite this, the organization had to drop the word "British" from its name due to EU rules. This was to avoid the impression that it receives state subsidies.
Agricultural experimental station.
The agricultural experiment station is located alongside the River Nene between the Sutton Bridge Power Station and the A17 road. It occupies the former RAF Sutton Bridge airfield site that was acquired in 1958 by the Ministry of Agriculture.

Florida State Road 953

State Road 953 (SR 953), locally known as Le Jeune Road (pronounced "Luh-JOO-n"), is a long north–south street in Miami-Dade County, Florida running a few miles west of central Miami from U.S. Route 1 in Coral Gables to State Road 916 in Opa-locka. It is also known as West 42nd Avenue on the greater Miami grid plan and East 8th Avenue in the Hialeah grid plan.
Route description.
Le Jeune Road proper begins at a traffic circle with Sunset Drive and Old Cutler Road in the city of Coral Gables, but the state designation actually begins north at an intersection with U.S. Route 1 (Dixie Highway).
SR 953 heads north from US 1 as a four-lane road through residential areas, the eastern end of Coral Gables Senior High School, and the western end of the Village of Merrick Park mall. SR 953 intersects Bird Road and leaves the campus of Coral Gables High School, entering a pure residential area and remains that way until reaching University Drive. At that point, the east side of the road becomes commercial and the west side is residential until close to the intersection with Coral Way (State Road 972). A few blocks north of Coral Way, it resumes with residential housing on the west side of the road and commercial buildings to the east, still in Coral Gables.
At Zamora Avenue, Le Jeune Road divides Coral Gables to the west with unincorporated Miami-Dade County to the east, and enters unincorporated Miami-Dade County just one block north at Mendoza Avenue, becoming purely a residential street again. At Southwest 8th Street (US 41/Tamiami Trail), Le Jeune Road enters the city of Miami, and becomes a divided road, with two lanes in each direction.
Le Jeune continues north through Miami, remaining a residential street for six blocks before becoming a commercial road. It continues north through Miami as a commercial street until an interchange with the Dolphin Expressway (SR 836), where the road becomes a divider between the International Links Miami-Melreese golf course to the east and a parking lot to the west. It reenters unincorporated Miami-Dade County after crossing the Tamiami Canal just south of the entrance to Miami International Airport and its interchange with the southern terminus of the Airport Expressway (SR 112). Between SR 953's entrance of the airport and the next major interchange north, State Road 948, it creates the eastern boundary of the airport, with airport related business to the east of LeJeune Road.
Just two blocks north of SR 948, SR 953 crosses canal C-6 and crosses US 27 (Okeechobee Road), entering Hialeah as their Southeast 8th Avenue and no longer a divided road. It continues north as a residential street, crossing State Road 944, becoming East 8th Avenue, the easternmost major street in Hialeah, with some commercial business at East 9th Street, State Road 934, East 41st Street and State Road 932. North of East 57th Street, it passes by a truck distribution center to the east, and a park to the west. SR 953 then splits off to the Le Jeune/Douglas Road Expressway Connection, providing nearby access to State Road 924, followed by an intersection with East 65th Street at the south end of Amelia Earhart Park, leaving Hialeah and entering Opa-locka where it is again West 42nd Avenue. North of SR 924, Le Jeune Road is a purely commercial road, servicing truck distribution centers as SR 953 heads towards its northern terminus of State Road 916 (North 135th Street).
North of SR 916, Le Jeune Road continues for , towards a dead-end inside Opa-locka Airport. North of the airport, Northwest 42nd Avenue continues north to a dead end beyond North 204th Street.
History.
According to Joaquin Roy, a highly regarded professor from the University of Miami in his 1989 book "The Streets of Coral Gables"; Le Jeune Road was named after Charles Le Jeune (b. 1878, Belgium) who came to Florida around 1900 and acquired of coral rock land on which he used dynamite to create tillable soil, and then cultivated orange, grapefruit and lime groves. The road that was the boundary of his property became known as Le Jeune Road. In 1914, Charles Le Jeune sold his groves to (George) Merrick, developer of Coral Gables, Florida, for $1,700,000. It runs adjacent to the east side and crosses the original entrance/exit to Miami International Airport.
At one point during the 1960s, the entire route was to be upgraded to freeway status, but the plans were cancelled. Several attempts to upgrade LeJeune Road around Miami International Airport have been proposed, with all of them failing.
Prior to 1983, Le Jeune Road was signed as State Road 913 south of North 103rd Street (SR 932); a designation now being applied to the Rickenbacker Causeway approach.

Benedikt Waldeck

Benedikt Franz Leo Ignatz Waldeck (31 July 1802 – 12 May 1870) was a left-leaning deputy in the Prussian National Assembly and later in the Second Chamber of the Landtag of Prussia. He is considered one of the leading left-wing liberals in Prussia during the German revolutions of 1848–1849. In May 1849 he was arrested in Berlin for high treason, but was acquitted in December. Waldeck is an important figure in German constitutional history and in the 1860s he became one of Otto von Bismarck's most important domestic political opponents.
Life.
Family, education and career.
His father, Johann Heinrich Waldeck, was a professor of law in Münster. His mother, Gertrudis Lindenkampf, came from a Westphalian patrician family. On 1 August 1802 Benedikt Waldeck was baptised in the Roman Catholic St Lambert's Church in Münster.
Waldeck attended the Gymnasium Paulinum in Münster, finishing his schooling in 1817. Afterwards he attended philosophical lectures at the University of Münster. He then began studying law at the University of Göttingen in 1819. In 1822 he completed his studies in Göttingen with a doctorate at the age of only 19.
After that he continued his legal training in Münster. In 1828, he passed the major state examination and was appointed Assessor. He then began working as a judge in Halberstadt, Paderborn and Vlotho. During this time he married Juliana Antonetta Catharina Langen in Paderbon in 1832. With her he had nine children, four of whom died young.
From 1836 to 1844 he worked as a judge at the Oberlandesgericht in Hamm. In 1844 he was appointed to the "Preußisches Obertribunal", the Prussian Supreme Tribunal, in Berlin.
Political activity.
In the course of the German revolutions of 1848–1849, Waldeck became politically active. He was elected to the Prussian National Assembly in 1848. After the dissolution of the Prussian National Assembly in 1849, he joined the Second Chamber of the Landtag of Prussia.
In July 1848 he created a liberal constitution for the Kingdom of Prussia, the so-called "Charte Waldeck". A weakened form of this draft was signed by King Frederick William IV of Prussia in December 1848.
In May 1849 he was arrested in Berlin for high treason, but was acquitted in December. Sir John Retcliffe (real name: Hermann Goedsche) was centrally involved in a forgery scandal to discredit Waldeck and then lost his government position for his criminal participation.
Despite his acquittal, Waldeck and other democrats were unable to remain politically active after the failed revolution under the government of Otto Theodor von Manteuffel. However, he was able to retain his position as a judge at the Prussian Supreme Tribunal.
Only after the later King and Emperor William I had taken over the regency in 1858 did Waldeck stand for election again in 1861. This brought him back into the Prussian parliament, where he became one of the leaders of the German Progress Party. In political opposition, he also became one of Bismarck's most important domestic opponents in the 1860s.
Due to a stomach illness, he had to end his political and professional activities.
Death and afterlife.
His stomach ailment, which is said to have been cancerous, was the cause of his death on 12 May 1870. His funeral in May 1870 was attended by up to 400,000 people, according to some reports. This would have been half the population of Berlin at that time. He was buried at St. Hedwig's Cemetery on Liesenstraße in Berlin. In 1890 a statue was erected in Berlin-Kreuzberg in the Waldeckpark, which is named after him.

Rice huller

A rice huller or rice husker is an agricultural machine used to automate the process of removing the chaff (the outer husks) of grains of rice. Throughout history, there have been numerous techniques to hull rice. Traditionally, it would be pounded using some form of mortar and pestle. An early simple machine to do this is a rice pounder. Later even more efficient machinery was developed to hull and polish rice. These machines are most widely developed and used throughout Asia, the most popular modern type in use today is the Engelberg huller designed by German Brazilian engineer Evaristo Conrado Engelberg in Brazil and first patented in 1885.
The Engelberg huller uses steel rollers to remove the husk. Other types of huller include the disk or "cono" huller which uses an abrasive rotating disk to first remove the husk before passing the grain to conical rollers which polish it to make white rice; this is done repeatedly since other sides of circular side of rice are not husked. Rubber rollers may be used to reduce the amount of breakage of the grains, so increasing the yield of the best quality "head rice", but the rubber rollers tend to require frequent replacement, which can be a significant drawback.

Royal Life Saving Society Canada

The Royal Life Saving Society Canada, commonly known as the Lifesaving Society or LSS, is a Canadian registered charity that works to prevent water-related injuries through various programs across Canada. The Lifesaving Society is an independent organization that is composed of ten provincial/territorial branches, tens of thousands of individual members, and over 4,000 affiliated swimming pools, waterfronts, schools and clubs. The Society helps prevent drowning and aquatic injury through its training programs, public education, drowning-prevention research, safety management and overseeing the sport of lifesaving. They are one of five nationally recognized first aid training organizations in Canada, alongside the Heart and Stroke Foundation, Red Cross, St. John Ambulance, and the Canadian Ski Patrol.
History.
The Royal Life Saving Society arrived in Canada in 1894 with its Honorary Representative, Arthur Lewis Cochrane, who joined the faculty of Upper Canada College in Toronto as a "Drill Instructor". The Society became formalized with the establishment in 1908 of the Ontario Branch as the first Canadian branch of the Royal Life Saving Society UK.
The Ontario branch of the RLSS was founded on December 10, 1908, with J. Howard Crocker as a charter member. Crocker introduced RLSS to the YMCA curriculum, and served as president of the Ontario branch of the RLSS from 1934 to 1937.
Programs and certifications.
Annually, over one million Canadians take part in the Society's swimming, lifesaving, lifeguard and leadership training programs. The Lifesaving Society is incorporated in Canada under the name "The Royal Life Saving Society Canada/La Société Royale de Sauvetage Canada", and it has branches for every province and territory. The Lifesaving Society represents Canada in the International Life Saving Federation and the Royal Life Saving Society Commonwealth.
The Society sets the standards for aquatic safety in Canada and certifies Canada's National Lifeguards. The Society is the Canadian governing body for the sport of lifesaving, which is recognized by the International Olympic Committee and the Commonwealth Games Federation.
Lifesaving Society certifications include:
The Lifesaving Society also trains coaches and officials for lifesaving sport.
In 2012, the Lifesaving Society joined forces with the Canadian Red Cross and the Public Health Agency of Canada to launch the Open Water Wisdom initiative, which is a community water activity safety program dedicated to bringing awareness to recreational water safety issues nationally and in hundreds of remote communities across Canada.

<doc id="7003446" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7003446" title="Nuremberg S-Bahn">
Nuremberg S-Bahn

The Nuremberg S-Bahn () is an S-Bahn network covering the region of Nuremberg, Fürth and Erlangen which started operations in 1987 and is now integrated into the Greater Nuremberg Transport Association (Verkehrsverbund Großraum Nürnberg). The full length of the five current lines is about 277.6 kilometres.
The S-Bahn trains are operated by DB Regio Mittelfranken, a subsidiary of DB Regio Bayern. From December 2018 the service was due to be taken over by National Express Germany; however, it withdrew from the bidding process on 25 October 2016, so the lines will continue to be operated by DB Regio Mittelfranken for the foreseeable future.
The service between Fürth and Erlangen-Bruck has been marred by frequent delays and service restrictions due to the slow construction for four-track expansion. No completion date is given. The original plans for the upgrade of the Nuremberg Bamberg line to four tracks called for a new alignment of S-Bahn tracks east of the current two tracks to serve a (planned but now canceled) industrial development between Nuremberg Fürth and Erlangen. The city of Fürth sued against these plans, halting the construction and leaving sections of half built track without use. As an "interim solution" switches are planned to be installed to connect existing quadruple track sections to the legacy alignment, but a completion date is not yet known.
Current lines.
Night services.
There is also a night service every 60 minutes between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. on the lines S1, S2, S3, S4 and S6 on days before Saturday, Sunday and public holidays.
Rolling stock.
Initially the rolling stock consisted of Class 141 locomotives, later Class 143 locomotives hauling 3–4 x-Wagen coaches. Additional commuter trains were sometimes hauled by Class 111 locos.
In 2007 electric multiple units of DB Class 442 (Bombardier Talent 2) were bought to supplement and replace the loco hauled units. They were to go into service in 2010, but due to technical problems they had to be sent back to the producer. Meanwhile n-Wagen sets with rented locomotives were used instead of them. The Class 442 finally went into service in 2012.
In late 2020 a new batch of class 1440 Alstom Coradia Continental were brought into service, replacing the last x-Wagen sets. Three x-Wagen sets will, however, be kept at least until the smaller timetable change in June 2021 for replacement and additional commuter services with Class 111 locomotives. The Class 1440 were introduced primarily on S1 where they freed up the older class 442 sets to serve other routes. A few Class 1440 sets are also used on S4 and the new S5. As the line S5 uses the Nuremberg-Ingolstadt High Speed Line, the two units used on S5 had to be equipped with LZB. A large scale advertisement campaign was launched to inform the public of the new rolling stock.
Similar to the subway, for big events the S-Bahn often lent Class 423 trains from the Munich S-Bahn to support the rather small Nuremberg fleet.
Future expansion.
While there are no plans to build entirely new railway lines to add to the S-Bahn network, plans exist to upgrade and convert some existing lines to S-Bahn standards. In the past some extensions of S-Bahn service have simply been "relabeling" of an existing service such as S5 which was previously known as the "Allersberg Express". Indeed, no S-Bahn runs on an entirely new line, but in some cases the existing lines were extended, electrified or amplified for the introduction of S-Bahn service.
Towards Würzburg.
Plans include S-Bahn service along the Fürth Würzburg line which is currently one of the busiest lines in the region. In the course of Deutschlandtakt plans, a newly built high speed line is planned to enable travel times below 30 minutes between Nuremberg and Würzburg for high speed trains. This would free up capacity on the legacy alignment for more frequent service and the introduction of a "true" S-Bahn. Similar to the December 2020 switchover on "S5", there are plans to convert existing regional train service to Neustadt (Aisch) to a new "S6" with the December 2021 or the December 2022 schedule change. No changes in service pattern or additional infill stations are planned for that switchover. In late September 2021 it was announced that the new Nuremberg-Würzburg high speed line which is to include a tunnel from Nuremberg to , a neighborhood annexed to Fürth in 1972, was reclassified, together with other parts of the "Deutschlandtakt" concept into the highest priority group "vordringlicher Bedarf“. The new high speed line would free up capacity on existing infrastructure allowing S-Bahn service with better frequencies.
Towards Markt Erlbach and Cadolzburg.
The branch lines to Cadolzburg (Rangau Railway) and Markt Erlbach (Zenn Valley Railway) are currently not electrified and electrification is often seen as precondition for S-Bahn service along those lines. Other proposals call for the use of hydrogen powered trains or battery electric trains to replace existing diesel multiple units.
Towards Gräfenberg.
There are also plans to use the (largely extant but not used for passenger service) Nuremberg Ringbahn to integrate the Gräfenberg railway (which currently terminates at Nuremberg Nordost station along the Ringbahn) into the S-Bahn network. One of several proposals calls for the linking of the aforementioned lines to Cadolzburg and Markt Erlbach via the Ringbahn. However, such plans have repeatedly failed to reach the required benefit cost ratio above 1.0.
Towards Crailsheim.
In December 2020 the ministers of transportation for Baden Württemberg and Bayern announced their intention to extend the S4 from its current endpoint at Dombühl across the state line to Crailsheim with a proposed entry into service 2024. This extension opened as planned with the December 2024 schedule change.
Towards Neuhaus (Pegnitz) and Simmelsdorf-Hüttenbach.
In the course of the planned electrification of the Nuremberg Cheb railway there are also plans to establish S-Bahn service along this line. In the course of this expansion it is also planned to offer S-Bahn service along the branch line to Simmelsdorf-Hüttenbach (Schnaittach Valley Railway) In April 2021 a planning agreement between the State of Bavaria and Deutsche Bahn concerning the planning of S-Bahn service along the (to be electrified) right Pegnitz railway and the Schnaittach Valley Railway was signed. In the course of S-Bahn expansion, two new infill stations are planned: Hersbruck-East and "Eschenbach" in the borough of Pommelsbrunn of that name.
Towards Hilpoltstein.
Local politicians repeatedly demand to electrify the 11 km of the Roth Greding railway currently still in service and to extend S-Bahn service currently terminating in Roth along that line. A further precondition for S-Bahn service besides electrification is the upgrade or removal of at least some of the 22 level crossings along that line. A feasibility study ordered by the city of Hilpoltstein was released in 2020. Costs for the necessary electrification and associated upgrades to allow speeds up to 80 km/h (instead of the current 60 km/h speed limit) were given as 24 million € in 2020. In 2021 local farmers raised objections to the proposed closure of several level crossings as they were their principal users.
Infill stations.
Throughout the history of the S-Bahn, there have been a number of infill stations built along existing right of way to better serve certain areas. There are plans for a couple of infill stations, among them "Neumarkt Süd" (S3) "Bamberg Süd" (S1) and "Forchheim Nord" (S1)
Interchanges with other systems.
All S-Bahn stops are also served by buses.
U-Bahn S-Bahn interchanges.
There are multiple interchanges with the Nuremberg U-Bahn in both Nuremberg and Fürth, including at the stations Fürth Hauptbahnhof (U1/S1&amp;S6), Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof (all U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines), Fürth Klinikum / Unterfarrnbach (U1/S1), Nuremberg Rothenburger Straße (U2/U3 and S1), Nürnberg-Schweinau station (S4 / U2).
Straßenbahn Nuremberg interchanges.
There are interchanges between the S-Bahn and Straßenbahn Nürnberg at Nürnberg-Steinbühl station (S1, S2 / Tram lines 4 and 6) Nürnberg-Dürrenhof (S1, S2 / Tram line 5), Nürnberg-Ostring station (S1 / Tram line 5), Nürnberg-Mögeldorf station (S1 / Tram line 5), Nürnberg-Dutzendteich station (S2 / Tram line 6). Some extensions of the S-Bahn network would include interchanges to existing Tram services in the vicinity. The is to include an interchange at Erlangen Hauptbahnhof when built.

Lucien Petipa

Lucien Petipa (22 December 1815 – 7 July 1898) was a French ballet dancer during the Romantic period, and the elder brother to Marius Petipa, the famous ballet master of the Russian Imperial Ballet. He was born in Marseille and died in Versailles.
The son of Jean-Antoine Petipa, he was the original interpreter of many of the principal male roles during the Romantic era, working with choreographers such as Jean Coralli among others. Probably the most known role he created was Albert, Duke of Sliesa (later to be known as Count Albrecht) in the two-act ballet of "Giselle" in 1841, opposite the Italian-born ballerina Carlotta Grisi for whom the ballet was created. Between 1860 and 1868 he was "maître de ballet" at the Paris Opera and between 1872 and 1873 he ran the La Monnaie theater in Brussels.

Kentucky Foundation for Women

The Kentucky Foundation for Women promotes feminist art and social justice by awarding grants to individual artists and organizations, providing time and space for artists and activists at its retreat center, sharing information, and building alliances.
The Kentucky Foundation for Women is a 501(c)3 private, independent foundation that was established in 1985 by author Sallie Bingham of Louisville, Kentucky. At the time, Ms. Bingham's philanthropic gift of $10 million was the largest endowment to any women's fund in the United States. The mission of the Kentucky Foundation for Women is "to promote positive social change by supporting varied feminist expression in the arts."
The foundation funds two grant programs annually, they are "Artist Enrichment" and "Arts Meets Activism". Both grant programs are artist-centered, feminist in nature, and demonstrate high artistic quality. Applicants to both programs are expected to be able to express their commitment to feminism and their understanding of the relationship between art and social change.
Grant awards range from $1,000 to $7,500 per project. Social change, as defined by the foundation, includes "eliminating societal barriers to women: neutralizing discrimination against women based on age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical ability, economic condition, and geographic origin; and producing actions, conditions, policies, attitudes, and behaviors that benefit women."
Between 1985 and 2005 the Kentucky Foundation for Women awarded 1298 grants to individuals and organizations totaling $7,140,831.
Hopscotch House is a program of the Kentucky Foundation for Women; it is first and foremost an artist retreat center for feminist artists. It is also used by a variety of groups and organizations that are working to better the lives of women and girls in Kentucky.
Hopscotch House was purchased by the Kentucky Foundation for Women in 1987 and was first used by a group of women writers known as the Wolf Pen Writer's Colony. In the early 1990s Hopscotch House became available to other women artists and women's groups. Over the years, Hopscotch House has served hundreds of women including artists, activists, feminists, eco-feminists, art critique groups, drumming circles, quilting groups, social justice groups, girls' empowerment groups, arts organizations, and social service organizations.
The property is considered a "classic" Kentucky farmstead and is located 13 miles east of downtown Louisville. The house has five bedrooms, six bathrooms, a library of women's literature and reference works, a large living room/dining area, a sun room, and a deck. The large kitchen is fully furnished and well equipped so that residents can prepare their own meals. Separate studio space for artists is available upon request.
Other activities and support.
The Kentucky Foundation for Women has provided financial gifts for special projects such as the National Sculpture Conference: Works by Women held in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1987. The conference honored American women sculptors ages 67–88. The honorees were: Selma Burke, Elizabeth Catlett, Clyde Connell, Dorothy Dehner, Louise Bourgeois , Claire Falkenstein, Sue Fuller, Louise Nevelson and Claire Zeisler.
The Hot Flash Fan, purchased by the foundation, was a collaborative project completed by more than 50 artists. "The project is a fan incorporating needlework, knotting, quilting, and painting in an expression of feelings associated with menopause." Lead artists for the project were: Judy Chicago, facilitator; Ann Stewart Anderson, originator and principal coordinating artist; Ada O'Connor, principal embroidery artist/coordinator; Judith Myers, quilting coordinator. The Hot Flash Fan was on display at the Water Tower, home of the Louisville Visual Art Association, before being added to the Foundation's permanent collection.
The Kentucky Foundation for Women published 50 issues of the literary journal The American Voice, which featured international and Kentucky writers. The editor of the Pan-American journal was Frederick Smock and was published trianually from 1986 to 1999. During that time "The American Voice" published two stories that were awarded the Pushcart Prize that honors the best poetry, short fiction, and essays published in the small presses. It was a feminist publication that was known for featuring works by well-known authors such as Joyce Carol Oates, Isabel Allende, and Reynolds Price alongside Kentuckians Wendell Berry, James Still, and Sena Jeter Naslund. The journal also nurtured the work of less established, home-grown talent and published early work by the award-winning poet Aleda Shirley, novelist Barbara Kingsolver, playwright Naomi Wallace, and children's author George Ella Lyon.
Sallie Bingham Award.
The Sallie Bingham Award was established in 1996 to recognize individuals and groups who have made outstanding contributions toward changing the lives of Kentucky women through feminist expression in the arts. Recipients are given a $500 cash award, a gold-plated Ginko pin and plaque. The award is announced at KFW Day, an annual celebration held each fall at Hopscotch House.

Banham Conversions

Banham Conversions was a coachbuilder and manufacturer of kit cars from the late 1970s until 2004. The company, based in Rochester, Kent, was founded by Paul Banham and started off as a coachbuilder, converting vehicles into convertibles. The company built convertible versions of high-end vehicles such as the Ferrari 400, Aston Martin DBS and V8, and the Rolls-Royce Corniche during this time.
In the 1990s, the company moved on to selling conversion kits to the general public. These were mainly based on British cars, such as the classic Mini, Austin/Rover Metro, Jaguar models and the Austin Maestro. Non-British manufacturers used for Banham kit cars included Skoda and BMW.
Kits were sold up to the mid-2000s, when the Banham Conversions ceased production of all models, splitting the company's then-current model range between two separate buyers.
Vehicles.
Banham XJ-SS.
From 1994, Banham marketed a coach built service to rebody the Jaguar XJS into a more modern and slender shape using components from current models such as the Vauxhall Corsa and Ford Mondeo. In 1996, the company moved into offering "kits" for the first time now selling the full GRP body kit to fit and paint at home. 
Banham 130 Spyder.
The Banham 130 Spyder was based on the rear-engine Škoda Estelle and Rapid platform, and was a replica of the Porsche 550 of James Dean fame. The model proved to be one of Banham's most popular, as these two Skoda models were very cheap and easy to find at the time.
Banham 200.
After the end of Group B, Ford put the factory body panel moulds for their Ford RS200 up for sale, and they were bought by Paul Banham with the intent to produce the most accurate replica possible of the cutting-edge rally car.
Searching for a relatively cheap existing car to base this new Banham model on, he found that the Austin Maestro had the same wheelbase as the RS200, allowing for a cheap yet fast replica to be produced when an MG Maestro 2.0 or Turbo was used as the donor model. Despite the low price and high sporting potential, the Banham 200 naturally received criticism for having completely the wrong drivetrain layout. The Maestro - and by extension, the Banham product - used a front-engine, front wheel drive layout while the Ford used a mid-engine, four-wheel drive setup.
Banham X99.
The X99 was previewed to the public in March 1999 in various kit car magazines, and released shortly after to great acclaim by reviewers and journalists. Receiving particular praise were the styling, the range options and the low price of the kit - with the basic coupe package only costing £1395.
The only model available at launch was a fixed head coupe, but other models of the X99 were released by November including a full convertible and a 'Targa-style' removable roof option.
The X99 was based on the popular Austin/Rover/MG Metro, with the build process involving removing the roof and other bodywork, adding stiffeners and then fitting the replacement GRP bodyshell. Sales were excellent, with over 300 kits sold in the first six months of 1999 - but by 2000, VAG got involved and threatened legal action over the design, citing similarities to the Audi TT.
Banham X21.
The X21 was shown to the public for the first time on the Banham Conversions website on 1 January 2000, allowing the company to boast that it was "the first car of the new Millennium", beating the Rover 45's reveal by three days.
Despite the fanfare, the X21 was merely a X99 with slightly altered styling to differentiate it from the Audi TT. This proved enough to appease VAG, with the new headlights ironically coming from the VW Lupo.
In 2003, an X21 coupe was produced using the existing X99 moulds with new lights and other details, this was named the X21 GT.
Banham Superbug.
The Superbug was planned to be an entry-level kit that anyone could build, and to this end it was designed as an X21 variant with no doors, no roof, no rear window, amongst other small changes to simplify the build process. The car was originally to be named the 'SB2000', but was renamed to Superbug for production.
The company claimed that this new model was a spiritual successor to the Mini Moke, and in a similar manner to the Moke, a basic roof frame and roof with zipped sides were offered to provide weather-proofing.
The basic 'starter kit' for the Superbug started as little as £995, but for all the extras to finish the car it would cost £1495. In 2000, this was the cheapest kit car on sale and it therefore sold very well for the four years it was on sale.
The 'New Speedster'.
The company would capitalise on its earlier success with its '130 Spyder' with a new Porsche replica, this time inspired by the Porsche 356. but had slightly different styling and a shorter wheelbase to an original 356. Unlike the 130 Spyder (but like the X99/X21/Superbug range), this model was based on the Metro.
Banham Redina.
Around 2000, a prototype was built using a similar rear-engine Skoda chassis as the earlier 130 Spyder, although with a body closer to the Porsche 356. It used the headlights from the first-generation Ford Ka, but the extent of any further part sharing is unknown as both information and photos of the vehicle are hard to come by. A single Paul Banham Conversions-branded advert and several press photos are all that survive of the Redina, with the advert being the only way of knowing the vehicle's manufacturer due to the lack of physical badging on the car.
Banham Bat.
Paul Banham's final Metro kit was the Banham Bat, which was designed to look far bolder than their earlier Metro-based models. Due to both the styling and the name, the Bat has often been compared to the Batmobile - typically in a mocking way. The large, upright front grille has also provoked comparisons with the Bugatti Veyron, again often in a derogatory manner.
The Bat was launched in early 2002 with two models: buyers could either have a traditional coupe or option a removable 'Targa-style' roof panel. The model was not successful however, failing to match the sales of the more conventionally-styled X99 or X21 models on the same platform.
Banham Sprint.
By far one of the most popular kits offered by Banham was the Sprint, designed to be a close replica of the first-generation Austin-Healey Sprite. The vehicle used the chassis of the classic Mini, making it front wheel drive instead of the rear wheel drive like the original. Another difference to the Sprite - but a similarity to Banham's other models - was that the bodyshell was fibreglass.
Banham Mini Roadster.
Paul Banham's final design was also based on the classic Mini, and was far closer in spirit to the company's earliest models in that it was a convertible conversion of an existing production car. The prototype was shown to the public in 2001 and used blended GRP panels and roll over hoops for the roadster styling.
Unlike the previous Banham cars this was a coach built service, so donor vehicles would be taken to the Banham factory to be converted rather than supplied as a kit.
Banham 120.
One of the last designs advertised by Paul Banham conversions was a replica of the Jaguar XK120 convertible, and like the Banham Mini Roadster this was a not sold as a kit but instead as a coach built vehicle. It was produced using (at the time) fairly modern 1990s BMW parts, but looked like an original XK120 on the outside.
Ending of production.
By 1998 much of the kit car market had fallen. After the introduction of the SVA test, the SVA was introduced by the British Government to regulate the kit car industry and regulate the quality of kits produced for and by customers before they could take to the road, the SVA was very strict compared to previous kit cars only needing to pass a MOT and cost up to £450, without passing a SVA test you couldn't register your car to drive it legally on the road.
Banham Conversions kit car models avoided all this as the kits were considered bodyshell conversions which avoided the need for a SVA test but the DVLA caused problems as it was mentioned in a 2003 issue of "which kit? magazine" that some DVLA officers were not allowing owners of Banham kits to register their vehicles without a SVA test first, while other DVLA officers were allowing them to be registered without. This lasted until 2004 when VOSA/DVLA decided the modifications needed to create a Banham kit car was more than a bodyshell swap and needed a SVA, and all kits were discontinued after the company was sold to Rally Sport Replicas Ltd. They sought to create a new design of chassis for the previous models, but they ceased trading in early 2005 after little was achieved and no kits sold.
The New Speedster design was excluded from the sale to Rally Sport Replicas Ltd because the design and tooling were instead sold to 356 Sports during 2006. Like Rally Sport Replicas Ltd, they also ceased trading shortly after.
After the company's sale, Paul Banham would go on to produce a Jaguar XJ-S-based replica of the Jaguar XK180 concept under a separate company. He later began to restore &amp; create new classic wood rim steering wheels, offered under his Myrtle Ltd company.

Stephen Moore (rugby union)

Stephen Thomas Moore (born 20 January 1983) is an Australian former rugby union footballer, who played Super Rugby for the Brumbies and Queensland Reds and has 129 caps for Australia internationally, including 24 tests as captain.
Moore is the 14th most capped player of all time, has the third most Test appearances for Australia behind George Gregan and James Slipper and is the only Australian hooker to have played 100 Tests. He is also the second most capped Australian Super Rugby player of all time, and is one of only four players in Australian Rugby history, along with Nathan Sharpe, Michael Hooper and James Slipper to have achieved 100 Test and 150 Super Rugby appearances.
Early years.
Born in Saudi Arabia to Irish parents, his father Tommy came from Tuam, County Galway and his mother Maureen came from Killasser near Swinford, County Mayo. He and his family moved to Tuam, in the mid-eighties before they emigrated to Mount Morgan, Queensland, Australia in 1988, when he was five years old. His family later moved to Rockhampton, before finally settling in Brisbane.
Career.
Moore came up through the junior ranks in Queensland, playing schools rugby with Rockhampton Pioneers and Brisbane Grammar School prior to joining the University of Queensland Rugby Club from where he represented the Australian Under 19s. He made his Super 12 debut in 2003 for the Queensland Reds against the Bulls. He then went on to play for the under-21 Australian team at the 2003 and 2004 under-21 world championships, as well as with Australia A.
He was included in the 2005 Wallabies squad for the mid-year Tests. He debuted with Rocky Elsom against Samoa. He came off the bench in matches against Samoa, Italy and France. He was then capped three times against South Africa. In November he joined the Wallabies in France when fellow hooker Adam Freier sustained an injury. He played in the loss against France on 5 November. After the whirlwind of 2005 where Moore made his debut for the Wallabies and featured in every Queensland Reds Super 12 game, 2006 was a mixed bag which saw him finish the season on the reserves bench. However, his skills and strength as a ball runner brought an extra dimension to the Reds forwards and earned him selection on the Wallabies end of year tour to Europe.
In November 2006, Moore travelled to Europe for the Autumn Internationals series. He was used as a replacement in the Australia v Italy game (25–18) in the Stadio Flaminio, Rome. He then played for the Australia A squad that defeated Ireland A mid-week in Thomond Park, Limerick. He then came on as a replacement in the 54th minute of the Ireland vs Australia game, in which Ireland ran out easy winners 21–6, in appalling conditions at Lansdowne Road stadium, Dublin. He made his first full International appearance for Australia the following weekend against Scotland at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh, touching down a pass from Matt Giteau to score his first International try. Australia were easy victors with a scoreline of Australia 44 – Scotland 15.
In 2010, Moore appeared in all 13 matches for the Brumbies until breaking his jaw in the final round of regular season.
Since the 2011 Tri Nations Series, Moore has been named in every squad, usually as first choice hooker. He was a key player in Australia's 2011 winning Tri Nations Series, and 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign, in which Australia finished third. Since Australia's first match against France in the 2012 end-of-year rugby union tests, Moore had played every single match for the Wallabies, including starting every test in 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia. When Robbie Deans resigned following the Lions series and when Ewen McKenzie took over the reins, Moore started at Hooker for the Wallabies for the remainder of the 2013 Test schedule playing very well.
In McKenzie's second year in charge, McKenzie named Stephen Moore as captain for the 2014 three-test June series against France, with Michael Hooper and Adam Ashley-Cooper as vice captains. However, in his first Test as Wallabies captain, Moore picked up a season-ending ACL knee injury as he went down awkwardly when making a tackle in the second minute and he left the field in the 5th minutes of the game in the Wallabies' 50–23 win over France at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium.
On 6 July 2015, Moore was named as Wallabies' captain for the upcoming World Cup under new coach Michael Cheika. Moore subsequently lead the Wallabies to the final against New Zealand, with the final score 34–17 to New Zealand, the highest overall combined score in a Rugby World Cup final.
Moore broke the record for most Super Rugby tries in a single season scored by a hooker in 2016, crossing the line seven times for the Brumbies that season, including a double in the 43–24 win against his former team the Reds. Moore also announced in late 2015 that he would return to the Reds following the 2016 season.
In 2017 Moore announced that he would retire from international rugby at the end of the year and retire from Super Rugby at the end of 2018. Moore's captaincy was immediately given to Michael Hooper. He last played for Australia on 25 November 2017, in a record 53–24 defeat to Scotland.
Moore was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours in recognition of his "significant service to rugby union, and to charitable organisations".
Personal life.
Moore is married to Courtney, and has three children, Theodore, Darcy, and Lawrence.

SS Raffaello

SS "Raffaello" was an Italian ocean liner built in the early 1960s for Italian Line by the Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico, Trieste. She was one of the last ships to be built primarily for liner service across the North Atlantic. Her sister ship was .
Design and construction.
In 1958, the Italian Line began planning new ships to replace the ageing and . Competition from jet airliners had not yet had a huge impact in the Mediterranean area and jobs were needed for Italian sailors and shipyard workers, so constructing new superliners seemed like an attractive idea to Italian Line executives. Consequently, the new ships grew from the originally planned 35,000 tons to nearly 46,000 tons. They were the largest ships built in Italy since and in the 1930s.
The Italian Line planned the ships as true ocean liners, divided into three classes. Oddly even for a liner, all cabins below A-deck were windowless, but on the technical side the ships were among the most advanced of their time. They featured retractable stabiliser wings, highly modernised engineering panels, and many other advantages. The funnels, in particular, were especially designed to keep smoke and soot from the rear decks. The funnel design proved to be highly effective, and it is a testament to their design that most funnels in modern passenger ships are built along similar principles.
The new ships' interiors were in the Art Deco style so often associated with liners. "Raffaello"s interiors were designed by architects such as Michele and Giancarlo Busiri Vici, who had not worked on liner interiors before. As a result, "Raffaello" gained highly futuristic, more distinctive, but more sterile interiors than the "Michelangelo". Despite being planned as identical ships, "Raffaello" was shorter, wider, and approximately 22 tons larger than the "Michelangelo".
Service.
It took five years to finish "Raffaello", a long time even by the standards of the day. The ship was further delayed when stern vibrations were discovered during the first sea trials. The ship's propellers and transmission system were modified to eliminate the vibrations. The modifications were successful and the ship was finally ready for service in July 1965. Senior Captain Oscar Ribari commanded the ship on its maiden voyage. The passengers included the Sinovčić Royal family, His Highness the Grand Prince of Dalmatia, Ante Edo Sinovčić, and his wife, with their two children and Italian Senate-president Cesare Merzagora and his wife, the ship's godmother.
In 1966 "Raffaello" carried two Spider 1600 cars bound for an exhibition in the United States. The cars were even driven on the ship's first-class lido decks, a first for an ocean liner. 1969 saw "Raffaello" perform in the Italian film "Amore mio aiutami", made in part to promote the two ships (despite the film officially being set on board "Raffaello", it was filmed onboard both ships). In 1970 "Raffaello" became the first ship whose theatre stage was converted into a skating rink and skating shows were performed for passengers. In 1970 the ship suffered the most serious accident of its career when, under command of Senior Captain Luigi Oneto, it collided with a Norwegian oil tanker off the south coast of Spain in May 1970. There were no deaths.
Although "Raffaello" was the larger of the two ships, and its interiors more distinctive, she was always the less important ship in the eyes of Italian Line executives. As a result, when the transatlantic traffic started declining due to competition from air traffic, "Raffaello" was sent cruising in order to make more money while "Michelangelo" was used strictly for crossings. "Raffaello" was not very well suited for cruising. Although it did have a large amount of open deck space, the ship was too large, its cabins too small, and most of them too spartan for demanding cruise passengers.
Sale to Iran.
The Italian Line decided to withdraw "Raffaello" in April 1975, after the Italian Government announced that it would not further subsidize the ship (by 1975, it was paying 100 million lire per day, or about $151,500 at the then-current exchange rate, to keep it sailing). Initially laid up in Genoa and later in La Spezia near the scrapyard, "Raffaello" and "Michelangelo" were inspected by several potential buyers such as Norwegian Cruise Line, Costa Amatori, Chandris Group, and Home Lines. The last even made a serious offer to buy the ships, despite large rebuilding costs, but the Italia Line rejected the offer.
In 1976 the Shah of Iran emerged as a buyer the Italian Line could accept. The former flagships of Italy that had cost a total of $90 million in 1965, were sold for $4 million a decade later. "Raffaello" made its final journey late in the same year from La Spezia into Bushehr, where it served as a floating barracks for the next seven years.
In 1978 plans emerged to resurrect "Michelangelo" and "Raffaello" as cruise ships. "Raffaello" would have become "Ciro il Grande" (named after ancient Achaemenid ruler Cyrus the Great), a luxury cruiser accommodating 1,300 passengers. But Italian specialists sent to evaluate the ships' condition realized the ships were too decrepit to make reconstruction financially viable. As a result, "Raffaello" stayed in its moorings. The ship was heavily damaged and looted during the Iranian Islamic Revolution in 1979.
In 1983 plans were again made to bring "Raffaello" and "Michelangelo" back into service as cruise ships. But "Raffaello" had been hit by a missile during the Iran–Iraq War in 1983 and partially sank in shallow waters outside Bushehr. Sometime later the wreck was rammed by an Iranian cargo ship. Local divers further looted the hull in subsequent years.
, "Raffaello"s hull remained partially submerged, and there have been reports of plans to scrap the ship completely. These plans were refuted by the Department of Environment as the ship has become part of the ecosystem. At least one of Raffaello's propellers was removed illegally and taken to Isfahan. One source indicates that it is not visible from the surface, but its position () is marked by warning buoys.

Chain Camera is a 2001 American documentary film directed by Kirby Dick about the lives of Los Angeles high school students. It premiered at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival.
Summary.
"Chain Camera" is made up entirely of footage shot by students at John Marshall High School in Los Angeles. The filmmakers gave Hi-8 video cameras to ten students and asked them to record their lives for one week before passing the cameras on to ten new students. This process continued throughout the school year, and the filmmakers then selected 16 student video diaries for the film.
The film's subjects represent diverse backgrounds in terms of race, religion, socio-economic background, gender, and sexual orientation. Most segments feature scenes of the students interacting with friends and family members as well as personal video diaries in which the subjects analyze their lives. Dick has stated that he did not censor any of the students' footage except in situations that might violate child pornography laws, such as a scene in which a teenager performs a simulated sex act using a banana.
"Chain Camera" subjects encounter a variety of different situations and discuss how these have affected their lives. Topics include eating disorders, running away from home, suicide, backyard wrestling, racism, nationality, sexuality, family, AIDS, music, alcoholism, political activism, and graffiti art.
Reception.
Critics praised the film for its honesty and the diversity of its student subjects. Scott Tobias of "The A.V. Club" said, "By turns playful, harrowing, intensely moving, and uproariously funny, "Chain Camera" cuts away all documentary artifice and goes straight to the source, allowing these kids to reveal themselves with the utmost directness and candor." Several critics also made favorable comparisons to Michael Apted's "Up" series, which has chronicled the lives of several Britons over the course of several decades. Dick has acknowledged Apted's influence and has stated that he plans to follow the "Up" paradigm by making a sequel film that documents Chain Camera's subjects as adults.

Kings County Hospital Center

Kings County Hospital Center is a municipal hospital located in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City. It is owned and operated by NYC Health + Hospitals, a municipal agency that runs New York City's public hospitals. It has been affiliated with SUNY Downstate College of Medicine since Downstate's founding as Long Island College Hospital in 1860. Kings County is a member of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. 
Kings County was named the country's first Level 1 trauma center. It is also a Designated Stroke Center, Level III Perinatal Center, Designated AIDS Center, Parkinson's Disease Center of Excellence, Diabetes Education Center of Excellence, Behavioral Health Center (including inpatient, outpatient with dedicated emergency department) and Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner (SAFE) Program Center of Excellence.
Kings County serves the boroughs of Brooklyn and Staten Island, with over 510,000 clinic visits and 140,000 emergency department visits in 2015. The hospital provides services to more than 800,000 people in the surrounding communities, including 415,650 in the primary service area of Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brownsville, Crown Heights, Canarsie, East Flatbush, East New York, Flatbush, and Prospect Lefferts Gardens. Ethnic diversity among the mostly black and Hispanic population served (94%) by Kings County is high, with large populations from the Caribbean as well as South American and African countries. Accordingly, Kings County employees speak 39 different languages to meet this diverse population's needs.
History.
Kings County Hospital was born of necessity, dedicated to caring for the underprivileged of Brooklyn. In 1824, New York State established a law requiring several counties, including the County of Kings (Brooklyn), to purchase lands to be used exclusively to house the poor, deferring all potential real estate taxes which could be levied on the land. The law stated that taxation of the surrounding inhabitants would be used to fund these projects.
The hospital was then established in 1830 as Brooklyn County Almshouse. The first hospital building was constructed in 1837, after land was purchased from the Martense family for three thousand dollars.
In 1857, an investigation was initiated by the temporary president of the State Senate, Mark Spencer, to visit all establishments created by the 1824 law. The investigation surveyed the Brooklyn County Almshouse, finding a hospital and lunatic asylum among other buildings constructed since the creation of the law. The hospital was a four-story 48 by 254 foot building housing 430 patients and lunatic asylum “260 feet long, wings 45 feet, and the centre 80 feet wide, four stories high” built to accommodate 150 patients but housing 205. At the height of the straitjacket, the lunatic asylum did not employ the use of physical restraints for patients, allowing them to freely mingle and take exercise at their leisure – “The resident physician observed that he considers 'kindness' more potent than chains”. The hospital and asylum each employed a single physician to care for all housed patients. Famously in 1864, Walt Whitman committed his brother to the asylum.
The mid-20th century was fruitful for public health and scientific advancement at Kings County. Some of the first successful large-scale family planning services in the country were started under renowned physician Louis Hellman. It began with his fight against a ban on family planning services in New York public hospitals in 1958. In 1965, due chiefly to efforts organized by Dr. Hellman, the New York State legislature lifted the ban on the prescription of birth-control medications in public hospitals in New York State. By 1966, it was demonstrated that these efforts were highly successful in lowering abortion rates, establishing a nationwide precedent. These efforts radically changed the availability for birth control among underserved and impoverished communities.
Working with populations in which sickle cell anemia was endemic, in 1966, Drs. Margaret G. Robinson and R. Janet Watson observed a high incidence of pneumococcal meningitis in sickle cell patients – a similar rate to that of post-splenectomy patients. Upon this conclusion they developed the first explanation for such a similarity being inability of macrophage phagocytosis in these encapsulated bacteria. These results were paramount in establishing the practice of vaccinating patients with sickle-cell anemia against encapsulated bacteria.
In 1997, Kings County began a modernization program.
This work was managed by the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, with the Gilbane/TDX Joint Venture as the Construction Manager. A Behavioral Health Center was added in 2008.
In 2003, the US Army established a training program at the hospital called the Academy of Advanced Combat Medicine to train reservists in an emergency department that has received 600 cases per year of gunshot and stabbing victims.
Services.
The hospital offers a wide range of services – women's health, child &amp; teen health, ambulatory care, behavior health, diagnostic services and surgical services.
Kings County Hospital has an extensive history treating acutely injured patients and publishing in the field of trauma surgery, as early as 1906, on the subject of surgical management of epidural hematomas by C.F. Barber, a surgeon at the hospital. The hospital has claimed many other "firsts" in the field of medicine, For instance, it was the site of the first open-heart surgery performed in New York State; NYC Health+Hospitals/Kings County physicians invented the world's first hemodialysis machine, conducted the first studies of HIV infection in women and produced the first human images using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Due to Kings County Hospital's prestige, many New York City Police Department officers reportedly prefer to get sent to the hospital if they get shot.
Controversy.
Kings County Hospital has paid out more than of all medical malpractice claims against the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (over $60 million). Since there are 11 city hospitals, this indicates that the hospital has a very high rate of malpractice claims compared to other city hospitals. It has been the most-sued hospital of the city's health care system. Kings County has also been criticized as having the longest emergency room wait of all public hospitals in New York City, with an average wait of 90 minutes for non-life-threatening conditions.
On June 19, 2008, Esmin Green, a 49-year-old native of the Caribbean country of Jamaica, died in the waiting room of the hospital's G Building, a psychiatric ward, which resulted in several people being fired, as well as investigations and lawsuits. The incident came in the midst of a federal lawsuit charging neglect by the hospital.
After seven years of oversight, the United States Department of Justice declared the hospital a model program for the treatment of behavioral health conditions.

Brian J. Ford

Brian J. Ford HonFLS HonFRMS (born on May 13, 1939 in Corsham, Wiltshire) is an independent research biologist, author, and lecturer, who publishes on scientific issues for the general public. He has also been a television personality for more than 40 years. Ford is an international authority on the microscope. Throughout his career, Ford has been associated with many academic bodies. He was elected a Fellow of Cardiff University in 1986, was appointed Visiting Professor at the University of Leicester, and has been awarded Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Microscopical Society and of the Linnean Society of London. In America, he was awarded the inaugural Köhler Medal and was recently recipient of the Ernst Abbe medal awarded by the New York Microscopical Society. In 2004 he was awarded a personal fellowship from NESTA, the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts. During those three years he delivered 150 lectures in scores of countries, meeting 10,000 people in over 350 universities around the world. 
Education.
Ford attended the King's School, Peterborough, and then Cardiff University to study botany and zoology between 1959 and 1961, leaving before graduating to set up his own multi-disciplinary laboratory.
Career and positions.
Other positions.
He was the first British President of the European Union of Science Journalists' Associations, founding Chairman of the Science and Technology Authors Committee at the Society of Authors, and the president of the Cambridge Society for the Application of Research (CSAR) of Cambridge University. Ford has been a member of Mensa and was a director of British Mensa from 1993–1997, resigning a few months after being elected for a second term. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society in 1962.
2012 aquatic dinosaur hypothesis.
In the April 2012 issue of "Laboratory News", Ford put forward the idea that all large dinosaurs were aquatic, arguing that they were too large and heavy to be land animals.
Although evidence has been presented for some dinosaurs like spinosaurids being partially aquatic, reaction to Ford's theory that the majority of dinosaurs being largely aquatic have been highly, if not universally negative, with other experts in the fields of paleontology and paleobiology having continuously disproven or refuted Ford's claims, with some suggesting Ford's hypotheses could be relegated as fringe theories. Several paleontologists, such as Darren Naish, have directly countered Ford in his arguments using documented evidence of dinosaurs being terrestrial to back their rebuttals to his work.

Alexandre Villaplane

Alexandre Villaplane (24 December 1904 – 27 December 1944) was a French football player who played as a midfielder. He appeared in the France national team in the 1928 Summer Olympics and captained the national team at the 1930 FIFA World Cup. Villaplane was also a Nazi collaborator who was arrested and executed for his actions during World War II.
Football career.
In his career he appeared in Sète (1921–1924), Nîmes (1927–1929), Racing Club de France (1929–1932), Antibes (1932–1933), Nice (1933–1934), and Hispano-Bastidienne (1934–1935). He was capped 25 times for the France national team, played for the France national team at the 1928 Summer Olympics, and was the captain of the France national team at the 1930 FIFA World Cup. At the latter he earned the accolade, which was considered to him, at the time, the greatest moment of his career.
He played for Antibes in the first French professional championship in 1932–33. The League was divided into a Northern and a Southern section with each section made up of ten teams. Antibes finished top of the table in the Southern section and played Lille from the North for the Championship. Antibes won the match and the French league but were stripped of their title after being found guilty of match-fixing. The Lille manager was given a lifetime ban, but Villaplane, who was strongly suspected of fixing the matches, received only a small penalty. Villaplane then joined OGC Nice for the 1933–34 season. Having lost interest in his career and having become a regular horse race-goer, he made one last attempt to resurrect his career with the Bordeaux Second Division club Hispano-Bastidienne, but he ended the season in prison, having been sentenced for his part in a horse race-fixing scandal.
Criminal career.
At the beginning of World War II, Villaplane became involved in the Parisian black market and in racketeering the local Jewish population. He was sentenced in 1940 to two months imprisonment for possession of stolen goods. Through his criminal background, he came to the attention of the French "Carlingue", an organisation formed by the German Reich Security Main Office to conduct counter-insurgency operations against the French Resistance. The group, which was made up of collaborating criminals, was known colloquially as the French Gestapo. It was jointly run by two Parisian gangsters, Henri Lafont and Pierre Bonny. Members utilised their criminal expertise and networks for the Nazi security services in occupied France and Vichy. Villaplane specialised in racketeering gold merchants.
In 1942, he left Paris for Toulouse to escape the Germans. His former teammate Louis Cazal obtained new identity papers for him and he returned to Paris. He was arrested by the SS in 1943 for the theft of a quantity of precious stones and imprisoned at the Compiègne camp; Lafont succeeded in obtaining his release.
Villaplane then became Bonny's chauffeur and then, in 1944, head of one of the five sections of the North African Brigade, a criminal organization made up of North African immigrants who collaborated with the Nazis through anti-Resistance activities. The fierce character of his recruits earned him the unflattering nickname of "SS Mohammed". He obtained both the rank and uniform of an SS-Untersturmführer. His section was put in charge of finding Resistance members and their supporters in the region of Périgueux in the month of March 1944, and then in the region of Eymet in the following month. It was in Eymet that he negotiated for the lives of over 50 hostages for money. On 11 June 1944, the day following the massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane, his squad had 52 people executed in Mussidan, with claims that Villaplane himself was also involved with the shootings at hand.
Execution.
He was sentenced to death on 1 December 1944 for his direct involvement in at least 10 killings. He was executed by firing squad on 27 December 1944 at the Fort de Montrouge, Arcueil, three days after his 40th birthday. His execution was alongside corrupt policeman Pierre Bonny and career criminal Henri Lafont.

Polizia Penitenziaria

The Polizia Penitenziaria (English: Prison Police), formally the Corpo di Polizia Penitenziaria, is a law enforcement agency in Italy which is subordinate to the Italian Ministry of Justice and operates the Italian prison system as corrections officers. Vatican City, an independent state, does not have a prison system, so the Vatican sends convicted criminals to the Italian prison system.
According to Interpol, this force (as part of the Ministry of Justice) has a "nationwide remit for prison security, inmate safety and transportation".
Operations.
The Polizia Penitenziaria carries out the functions of the Judicial Police, Public Safety, Traffic Police, and Corrections. They support other law enforcement agencies, such as with traffic roadblocks (known as "controllo").
Weapons.
The Polizia Penitenziaria are an armed police force, like most Italian police forces, and it uses a variety of firearms and weapons for self-defence:
Uniform.
As a national, civilian police force, the uniform and insignia is similar to other Italian police forces, with historical, service, and seasonal variations, as well as rank.
Principally, there are:
Uniforms are then further split along the lines of:
The type of uniform worn depends also on the duty being carried out. E.g. office work, prison landing work, armed exterior patrols or riots all require different uniform and equipment.
Recruiting.
The Polizia Penitenziaria recruits its members through an open, public, and competitive exam which is announced by the Ministry of Justice.
The training academies for the Polizia Penitenziaria are located in Aversa, Monastir, Cairo Montenotte, Castiglione delle Stiviere, Parma, Portici, Rome, San Pietro Clarenza, Verbania, and Sulmona.
Previous requirements.
Until the approval of the ordinary law n. 225 23 August 2004, the selection was open to any Italian civil citizen who had the requisites for absolving the military service. 
Those people had the right to absolve it directly within the Polizia Penitenziaria, after having passed the public exam for the qualification as an auxiliary agent. The selection was reserved to the Italian male residents who were eligible for the military service.
From 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2016, the working positions, which had been object of public selection, were reserved to volunteers who had a conscription in the Italian Armed Forces for one year (VFP1) or for four years (VFP4). 
On 1 January 2017, the public selections were newly open to civil citizens and a share of 40% of the available working roles began to be reserved to them. 
The psycho-physical requisites were the same fixed by the Decree of Italian President of Republic n. 904, which had come into force on 23 December 1983.
As of July 2021, the winners of the public exam have to frequent and pass an additional formative course whose duration ranges from around a year for the auxiliary agents to 24 months for the police commissioners. 
The latter position is solely accessible by people who are graduated with a 5-years degree in Jurisprudence or analogue degree titles.

Murder of Janine Balding

Janine Kerrie Balding was a homicide victim who was abducted, raped and murdered by a homeless gang of five (four youths and an adult) on 8 September 1988 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Balding's murder is often compared to the 1986 murder of Sydney nurse Anita Cobby.
Early life.
Balding was born on 7 October 1967 and lived in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales before moving to Sydney and gaining employment as a teller at a branch of the then State Bank of New South Wales on George Street. She was due to marry her fiancé Steven Moran in March 1989. The couple had purchased a house in Berkeley Vale, approximately 90 kms north of Sydney, and rented out that house to help finance their wedding.
Abduction and murder.
A month before her twenty-first birthday, she was abducted from a Sutherland railway station car park by a group of homeless persons consisting of four males and one female.
These persons were Bronson Blessington, Matthew Elliott, Stephen 'Shorty' Jamieson, Wayne Wilmot and Carol Ann Arrow.
Blessington had met Jamieson and Elliott at a homeless shelter named 'The Station' in the Sydney CBD earlier that day and had proposed "Why don't we get a sheila and rape her?", a quote which became infamously known through Australian news media. The idea was agreed to. Arrow and Wilmot joined in. The victim, who was to be picked at random, became Balding.
The gang of five had earlier approached another female—Christine Moberley—at the same car park, but she became concerned and quickly locked herself in her vehicle and drove home where she told her partner that the offenders were talking with another woman near a motor vehicle there. That person was Janine Balding.
Upon being alerted to these incidents, police immediately attended the main Sutherland railway station car park, not realising that the earlier encounters had happened in an overflow dirt car park on the opposite side of the rail line. Janine Balding had been abducted from that overflow car park in the intervening period.
She was driven in her vehicle to the side of the F4 Freeway at Minchinbury in Sydney's west, and during that time was partially stripped of her clothing and raped at knifepoint by Blessington, Jamieson, and Elliott. Arrow and Wilmot were in the car but did not rape her. On arrival at Minchinbury, she was again raped. She was then dragged from her vehicle, gagged with a scarf, hog-tied, then lifted over a fence and carried into a paddock by Blessington, Jamieson, and Elliott. She was then held down and drowned in a dam on the property.
Convictions.
All five members of the group were arrested and charged with Balding's murder. After weeks of deliberations and testimonies, Elliott, Blessington and Jamieson were each given life sentences plus 25 years. Wilmot was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in jail while Arrow was released on a good behaviour bond, as the pair did not physically participate in the rape and murder.
The sentencing of Blessington and Elliot became a topic of extreme controversy, because at the time they committed the murder and were sentenced, they were aged 14 and 16, respectively—becoming the youngest killers in Australia to be convicted and given the maximum sentence for murder.
In sentencing the defendants, Justice Newman said:
This trial was the first in Australian legal history where DNA evidence was tendered - leading to convictions based in part on that evidence. DNA samples were conveyed to a laboratory in the United Kingdom, which at the time was a world leader in DNA analysis, profiling and comparison. The two scientists from that laboratory who processed the DNA samples were brought to Australia to give evidence in relation to their analyses.
Given its significance in being the first time DNA evidence was tendered in an Australian court, the presiding Judge acceded to a request from the Crown Prosecutor that Police witnesses who were involved in the prosecution case be allowed to be in court prior to giving "their" evidence, to witness this history-making production of DNA evidence. Defense counsel did not object.
In 2007, Elliott and Blessington were granted an additional appeal based on a staple missing from their files. Essentially, it was argued, because the Crown indictment was not stapled to the court file, it was not "fixed" to the court file as required by law and the judgement was therefore not technically finalised. The High Court of Australia subsequently rejected this ground of appeal.
In an article published in "The Sydney Morning Herald", the crime was classified as a thrill killing.
Imprisonment.
Stephen Jamieson is currently housed in Lithgow Correctional Centre in maximum security. Jamieson has spent time in Long Bay, Goulburn and Lithgow.
Bronson Blessington is currently housed in South Coast Correctional Centre in maximum security. Blessington had spent time in Minda Juvenile Centre prior to his 18th birthday after that he has spent time in Long Bay, Maitland, Goulburn, Kempsey and Nowra. 
Matthew Elliott is currently housed in Lithgow Correctional Centre in maximum security. Prior to his 19th birthday he had spent time at the Minda Juvenile Centre after that he has spent time in Goulburn, Special Purpose Unit (Long Bay), Cooma, Junee and Lithgow.
Wayne Wilmot is currently being held on remand after being charged on 21 June 2024 by NSW Police's Sex Crimes Squad with breaching a court order. Wilmot had previously been due for release in 2019 but the NSW Government blocked his release due to nature of his crimes outside and inside prison, failing to understand the concepts of his crimes and fears that he is too dangerous to be released. His release was rejected in 2019, 2021 and 2023. He was finally released under strict supervision in June 2024, but less than two weeks later he was re-arrested after a search of his phone found that he had been searching online for child abuse material. Wilmot has spent time in Sliverwater, Lithgow, Goulburn, Metropolitan Special Program Centre (Long Bay) and Junee.
Further developments.
In 1998, Wilmot returned to prison for seven years after an attempted abduction and rape of a young girl in Western Sydney just two years after being released for time served over the accessory to murder of Balding. Wilmot was then linked to an earlier attack on a 19-year-old woman at Leightonfield, New South Wales after undertaking a DNA testing program for prisoners.
In 2003, the NSW Innocence Project (a joint project by the NSW Police Force, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Privacy Commissioner) used the latest DNA techniques to review the DNA evidence of the crime. This was done because Jamieson denied taking part in the murder, and one of the murderers had claimed that it was 'Shorty' Wells (rather than 'Shorty' Jamieson) who had committed the murder.
In February 2025 NSW Supreme Court Justice Ian Harrison ordered that unknown DNA profiles, that began appearing on the bandana used to gag Miss Balding when she was murdered, be compared against the DNA profile of Mark 'Shorty' Wells. 
Wells had been questioned by Homicide Squad detectives in 1988 and admitted that he was with the group that abducted Miss Balding. A homeless person at that time, he was considered an unreliable witness and was never charged with any crime against Miss Balding. 
When called as a witness at the murder trials Wells denied any involvement. 
The fight to have further testing done on the bandana was instigated by lawyer and former NSW politician Peter Breen, with the Crown resisting such a move on behalf of the NSW Police Commissioner and the NSW Attorney General. 
Mr Justice Harrison rejected the Crown's arguments stating that laws governing forensic procedures did not preclude it. 
The tests will be performed by the NSW Forensic and Analytical Science Service. 
The DNA results demonstrated that Jamieson's DNA was not found in a rectal swab taken from the victim at autopsy, and neither was the DNA of Wells. Police Minister John Watkins announced that the NSW Innocence Project would be suspended. Arrow subsequently stated that Jamieson was one of the murderers.
Janine's mother Beverley co-wrote, with journalist Janette Fife-Yeomans, a book entitled "The Janine Balding Story – A Journey Through A Mother's Nightmare", in which she relates how her family coped with the loss of Janine, of the police investigations and the lengthy trials. In October 2013—shortly after what would have been Janine's 46th birthday—and after suffering from and battling two and a half years of depression, Beverley Balding died after a short stay in hospital. She is buried alongside her daughter in the Wagga Lawn Cemetery.
In late October 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Committee ruled that the sentences of Blessington (14 when the crime was committed) and Elliott (16) breached the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Committee asked the Australian Government to "review the case and remedy the human rights breach".
In February 2016, Blessington lodged an appeal to be released from prison given he was only 14 at the time he committed the murder. Blessington claimed "he found God", that he was remorseful for his actions and was a changed man. Despite these claims, Janine's family reported that nearly three decades on from the murder, it had not received any formal apology or letter from Blessington expressing such remorse and did not believe he had changed.
Media.
An episode of the documentary series "Crime Investigation Australia" was devoted to the case.

X'Trapolis 100

The X'Trapolis 100 is a class of single deck electric multiple units part of Alstom's X'Trapolis family of trains, operated in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia and Valparaíso, Chile.
Melbourne.
In service.
As a partner of the Melbourne Transport Enterprises consortium, which was the new operator of the Hillside Trains network (later Connex Melbourne), it was announced in 1999 that Alstom would supply and deliver new trains to the Hillside Trains network.
When the trains were originally introduced to the suburban network in 2002, the trains operated only on the former Hillside Trains network (consisting of the Burnley and Clifton Hill group lines), and did not run revenue services elsewhere operated by M&gt;Train on the Bayside Trains half of the system. Although the two networks merged in 2004, when Connex took over all operations, the X'trapolis units still did not operate on the Bayside system at the time.
On 22 October 2014, the operation of X'Trapolis 100 trains was expanded to include lines on the former Bayside Trains network with the Frankston line being cleared for their operation and initially running two weekday morning-peak services.
On 20 November 2016, X'Trapolis 100 trains were expanded to full-time running on the Frankston line and began operating services on the Werribee and Williamstown lines the same day.
In November 2018, X'Trapolis 100 trains’ operations were expanded to the Flemington Racecourse line.
X'Trapolis 100 trains run on the Burnley, Clifton Hill and Cross-City groups, with all services operating with 6-car trains throughout the day except the Alamein (Camberwell - Alamein) and Williamstown (Newport - Williamstown) shuttles which runs with 3-car trains during shuttle operations off-peak and on weekends. The trains also serve the Flemington Racecourse line when services operate there, operating to both Showgrounds and Flemington Racecourse stations. However, the Flemington Racecourse Line only runs on special occasions.
Although Melbourne's trains operate as either one or two three-car units, it was not until September 2007 that the X'Trapolis 100s were permitted to operate as single-units in revenue service.
The trains have power-operated doors that open when a button on the door is pressed and are closed by the driver or closed automatically after approximately thirty seconds.
The X'Trapolis 100s and the HCMT are currently the only suburban trains in Melbourne with external destination displays on the sides of the carriages with this feature also seen on the diesel powered Sprinter and VLocity rail motors.
Several trains were given names: "Croydon West" (primary school that won a naming contest), "Don Corrie" (deceased railway employee), "Flash", "Flinders Flyer", "Iramoo" (primary school that won a naming contest), "Melbourne Rocks" and "Westernport". X'Trapolis 100 863M-1632T-864M-897M-1649T-898M was the first Melbourne train to receive the new ‘Metro’ livery in November 2009, in preparation for the launch of the new suburban operator. When the Connex livery was retired in place of the current Metro design, the "Iramoo" name (shown on units 851M and 852M) was erroneously written as "Imaroo". This spelling was changed a little over a decade later.
Refurbishment.
As part of its 2009 franchise agreement, Metro Trains Melbourne was required to modify the 3+2 seating layout in all original X'Trapolis 100s to have 2+2 seating, providing efficiency in passenger flow and more standing room. Later orders of X'Trapolis 100s were delivered with this modified layout.
All cars prior to the sixth batch sets underwent an additional interior refurbishment program starting from 2017, similar to the refurbishment that the Siemens Nexas had recently completed. All X'Trapolis sets comprising the first–fifth orders had a number of seats removed at the ends of the motor cars to create dedicated spaces for passengers using wheelchairs and also provide standing room for additional passengers, thus increasing overall capacity, accessibility and passenger flow of each motor carriage. Additional handrails and emergency assistance intercoms were also installed in accordance to the same interior design of the motor cars since the sixth batch.
Mechanics.
Mechanically, these trains are very different from the previous generation Melbourne trains. The X'Trapolis 100 was the first EMU in Melbourne to have computer-controlled traction, braking and safety systems. A continuous electrical circuit runs along the length of the train, which, when energised allows the train's emergency brakes to release. The circuit will be de-energised by a number of events, such as the driver releasing a vigilance control, applying an emergency brake or passing a signal at stop. This will cause the train to apply all brakes.
Incidents.
On 9 December 2004, 882M overran the platform at Belgrave and crashed into the fence at the end of the line.
On 26 September 2009, 872M crashed into a car between Croydon and Mooroolbark, derailed on impact and destroyed an overhead power stanchion. The Ford Fairmont had crashed down the embankment onto the tracks and was abandoned prior to the train collision. Coincidentally, on 3 January 2013, a Hitachi train derailed in the same location on the city-bound line due to rails buckling in hot weather.
On 12 May 2010, an almost brand new 9M overran a siding in Ringwood, derailing and crashing into the siding fence. The train had entered service less than a month prior.
On 24 March 2011, 920M overran the dead-end platform at Macleod, crashing into the fence at the end of the platform. Prior to the accident, the platform had recently been washed and the soapy water had ended up on the tracks causing a complete loss of friction. Additionally, it was found that the end-of-line baulks (two wooden sleepers placed across the rails in lieu of a buffer stop) were also defective; the train wheels simply pushed them along the rails.
On the morning of 11 November 2015, an individual later identified as a then Metro employee gained access to the cabin of an X'Trapolis 100 six-car set stored at the depot of Hurstbridge station and drove it into a derail block, causing it to be derailed. 927M received the most damage in the incident from ploughing into an adjacent X'Trapolis set, whilst other carriages and track equipment were damaged. All carriages are expected to be back in revenue service after being repaired.
On 6 February 2016, 1305T, led by 9M, derailed just before Rushall station city-bound, where the track is on a very tight bend. The South Morang line was partially suspended while the carriage was placed back onto tracks.
On 9 November 2018, a Lilydale-bound service, led by 959M, uncoupled in running shortly after departing Croydon station, splitting into two three-car units, with the trailing unit coming to a stop under emergency braking. The subsequent investigation found that a wiring error during a modification to the train's low-note whistle on 959M, combined with a deterioration of insulation resistance in the uncouple solenoid connector of 882M (the leading carriage of the trailing unit), resulted in an error circuit forming which resulted in the unintended coupling.
On 12 August 2021, X'Trapolis set 871M-1636T-872M collided with a semi-trailer truck at the High Street Road level crossing near station before 8am, causing damage to the train only. Substantial damage was caused to the overhead structure by the truck, and the front bogie of the train derailed. After recovery efforts, the set was then taken to Epping Workshops.
On 14 July 2025, X'Trapolis carriage 1627T derailed just north of Clifton Hill station; none of the train's 55 passengers was injured, but the derailment damaged trackside infrastructure and forced a dayslong closure of the Hurstbridge and Mernda lines.
Valparaíso.
Valparaíso has had an interurban passenger train system since the 19th century, but it could not be called a metro due to an infrequent train service and other shortcomings. In 1999 construction began on the current system, tearing down the old stations and building new ones with a homologous design. In Viña del Mar, a tunnel more than five kilometres in length was constructed. The new trains, specially made for the new system, arrived in Chile on 22 February 2005 and the old system was decommissioned on 30 June 2005.
The metropolitan railway that opened in 1855 between the Barón station in Valparaíso and El Salto, near Viña del Mar, is the oldest continuously operating railway in the southern hemisphere. At the end of the 1990s, the decision was made to renew the railway equipment, equip the region with state-of-the-art trains and, at the same time, organise a new functional structure with new stations and the undergrounding of an important part of the route.
The purchase of the rolling stock was completed in November 2002, with the signing of a contract between Merval and the French company Alstom, which in addition to guaranteeing the delivery of 27 convoys of 2 cars, included signaling, control systems and electrical power, as well of various items that ensured maintenance for 30 years.
The work for the implementation of this project, called Stage IV, began in 1999, with the demolition of the solid construction stations, replacing them with bus stops, and only remodeling the Limache station for the new uses that would later be given to it, making them architectural homologation and functionally. The road was buried with the construction of a tunnel of more than 5 kilometres between the Caleta Abarca and El Salto sectors in the Viña del Mar commune, leaving 4 stations under the street line, and allowing a restructuring of the fascia urban environment via Vina Mar. The work on the tunnel suspended the service was between July and November 2005.
The first car of the new fleet arrived in Chile on 22 February 2005. On 30 June 2005, a farewell ceremony was held for the old Suburban Electric Motor Vehicles (AES), built in Argentina by Fiat Concord, which provided commercial service until July 2005. At 12:45pm a "symbolic" tour began that began in Valparaíso and concluded in Limache. Thus, stations, bus stops and the signalling system completed their last day.
The service began with a 3-day white march, operating partially outside the tunnel between 21 and 23 November 2005. On 23 November, the inauguration ceremony was held, which was attended by the then President of Chile Ricardo Lagos. The service formally began on 24 November 2005.
Merval rolling stock.
Unlike the Melbourne version, Merval trains do not have intermediate cars. They only consist of two cars with a cabin, one motor (which has the pantograph) and another trailer. They can also operate as double units, forming convoys of 4 wagons, but always smaller than the Melbourne version.
The door system is the same as in the Melbourne version. The doors are activated by pressing a button on the door and are closed by the driver or after two minutes. Each car has three passenger doors per side, which gives a total of six doors per single car and 12 per trainset.
Each car has a single pantograph that delivers energy to the motor car from the catenary available throughout the network.
Due to the lack of a catenary, the trains do not operate beyond the Limache station, although the possibility of extending Merval's service to La Calera is being analysed.
Changes in passenger seats.
Contrary to what was done in Melbourne, Merval announced a reduction in seat capacity of its trains, to be implemented between October and December 2014. This reduction seeks to increase train capacity to meet the growing demand of passengers. Although exact figures were not provided, a reduction of approximately 46 seats per train is expected, to be homologated to the 96 that the X'Trapolis Modular has, a model of which 8 units will arrive in 2015 to reinforce Merval's service.
Antimicrobial trains.
In a pilot plan between state copper company Codelco and Alstom, one car was modified to include antimicrobial copper in the handrails and contact areas. The modification, which included the removal of handles and panels, is part of the search for new uses for copper that Codelco carries out as part of its market development plan.
However, months later, the copper railings were removed and the car returned to its original condition.

Drvenik Veli

Drvenik Veli is a Croatian island in the Adriatic Sea. It is situated in the middle of the Dalmatian archipelago, northwest of Šolta, from the mainland. Its area is . The highest peak is 178 metres high. The only settlement on the island is the near-eponymous village of Drvenik Veliki () with a population of 150 (2011 census).
The island was first inhabited in the 15th or 16th century. The main industries on the island are agriculture, fishing and tourism. The coast of the island is mainly rocky, but also has a few famous sand and pebble beaches like Krknjaši and Kokošinje.
Etymology.
Since ancient times, the island has been known by its Romanized name, "Zirona". The name "Zirona" likely originated from the Illyrian root "gųer" meaning "forest", possibly because of the island's once dense woodlands. In Croatian documents from the 13th century, the island is mentioned as "Girona", "Gerona" or "Giruna". Some suggest that the name Girona might have Greek origins, derived from the noun "gyrona" meaning "rounded object", a notion supported by the island's somewhat rounded morphology. The Croatian name Drvenik ("veli" means "large" in Croatian) finds its origin in the Croatian word "drvo", meaning "wood", establishing a link either to its Illyrian roots, according to some, or to the town of Drvenik near Makarska, from which a significant portion of its population migrated in the 17th century.

O'Leary

O'Leary is an Irish surname derived from the Gaelic Ó Laoghaire, meaning "descendant of Laoghaire"—a personal name often interpreted as "keeper of the calves" or "calf herder." The name is historically associated with a prominent family lineage in County Cork, Ireland, where the O'Learys were chieftains in the ancient kingdom of Munster. Over time, individuals bearing the O'Leary surname have become notable in various fields such as politics, military service, literature, and religion, both in Ireland and abroad.
History.
Ancient.
The Uí Laoghaire clan, today associated with the Uibh Laoghaire parish in County Cork, is considered by scholars to have originated in the early Middle Ages on the south-west coast, in the area of Ros Ó gCairbre (Rosscarbery), of which the O'Leary were hereditary lords.
The Annals of Innisfallen (Dublin copy) records St. Fachtna's (Saint Fachanan) death in 600 AD as occurring in "O'Laeghaire of Ross i.e. Corca Laidhe-I-Laeghaire Ruis". The clan traces its lineage to Lugaid Mac Con, an ancient King of Tara and High King of Ireland, and descendant of Dáire Doimthech. In the 12th century the O'Leary's were recognised hereditary wardens of St Fachtna's monastery and seat of higher learning, the School of Ross. In more recent times (since 1300 AD), the clan, of the Corcu Loígde, was pushed north and settled in an area west of Macroom around Inchigeelagh called Uibh Laoghaire (or Uibh Laoire in modern Irish – the 'gh' is silent in the old Irish). Their presence in the area is marked by a four story stone tower house called Carrignacurra Castle, which was built on a rocky outcrop on the south bank of the River Lee in the late 16th century, a mile east of Inchigeelagh. 
The Corcu Loígde were the rulers of Munster, and of territories beyond the province, before the rise of the Eóganachta in the 7th century. According to historian C. Thomas Cairney, the O'Learys were one of the chiefly families of the Corca Laoghdne tribe who in turn came from the Erainn tribe who were the second wave of Celts to settle in Ireland from 500 to 100 BC. The port of Dún Laoghaire, near Dublin is not associated with the O'Leary sept(s), rather it is named for Lóegaire mac Néill, a 5th-century High King of Ireland.
The book of Lecan (A.D. 1397-A.D. 1418) details the early status of O'Leary as a Corco Laide "taisach duchusa" (hereditary chieftain) in the tuath of Ross (Ruis), with associated families:Tuath Ruis .i. Tuath in Dolaich, o Loch in Bricin co Faid Ruis -, o Thraig Long co Sid na Fear (i) Find. O Leagaire a taisach duchusa. Is iad so an oclaid duchusa .i. O Ruaidri -, O Lonan -, O Laidid -, O Torpa -, O hUrmoltaich -, O Mirin -, O Meic Dairic -, O Tuaraide -, O Trena -, O hUainidi -, O Cerdin The name also occurs in the Cineal Laoghaire branch of the Eoghanacht dynasty which later came to dominate Munster. With the unrelated Corco Laidhe and Eoghanacht branches of O'Learys settling in north-west Cork and nearby Kerry respectively, the tracing of lineage is complex.
Modern.
Although almost nothing is known of their activities for several centuries, the O'Learys reappear as a still titled family in the 16th century, and relatively wealthy, although they were subject to the MacCarthy of Muskerry dynasty, from whom they received the White Wand (a symbol of authority). They were the only other freeholders in Muskerry besides the O'Mahonys, and had built several castles in their territories, including Carraignaneelagh, Drumcarragh and Carrignacurra, of which Carrignacurra is the only one still standing. The celebrated Irish language writer Peadar Ua Laoghaire was a descendant of the Carrignacurra branch of the family.
Auliffe O'Leary joined the side of Hugh Ó Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone in the Nine Years' War, from the very inception of it, and took the field with William Bourke (Clanricarde) and others. For this the chiefs of the O'Learys were eventually attained, and their lands parceled out, but because of the remoteness of their territory it was never carried out, and they remained safe there until the Cromwellian confiscations decades later. Donough MacCarty, 1st Earl of Clancarty did however appear to do his best to allow them to stay on their lands through leasing. The family became much more scattered during the later Williamite War in Ireland.
As an example of their wealth and capacity in the mid-16th century, an early O'Leary of Carrignacurra is purported to be the fosterer of Donnel na g croiceann, or Donnel of the Hides, ancestor of the modern O'Donovans of Clan Cahaill. His daughter Ellen married Donnell. Their issue was Donnell II O'Donovan.
The last O'Leary lord of the Old Gaelic order was Donal MacArt O'Leary (1575–1657).

BlazeSports America

BlazeSports America is a national nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization based in Decatur, Georgia, that provides sport and physical activity opportunities for youth and adults with physical disabilities.
History.
BlazeSports America, Inc. was founded as the U.S. Disabled Athletes Fund, Inc. (USDAF). It was established in 1993 to become the legacy of the 1996 Paralympic Games held in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1998, a model program was rolled out in Georgia in partnership with the Georgia Recreation and Park Association to bring community-based disability sports programs to communities across the state. The BlazeSports Georgia activities were funded, in part, by a grant from the State of Georgia. In 2002, in partnership with the National Recreation and Park Association, BlazeSports launched a national program offered through BlazeSports clubs and affiliates. The organization now bears the name of the highly popular Atlanta Paralympic Games mascot, Blaze. BlazeSports America is a chapter of Disabled Sports USA.
Current programming.
BlazeSports America has a network of local programs delivered in conjunction with community agencies and organizations in Georgia. Sports camps, clinics, workshops, tournaments and competitions are offered by BlazeSports America. Additionally, BlazeSports America has organized a National Disability Sport Conference annually each spring to train coaches, officials, local service providers, and leaders in the field of Paralympic Sport.
Seven BlazeSports staffers traveled to Haiti in June 2011 to strengthen and support Haiti's programs for disabled athletes.
Mascot.
BlazeSports' most prominent symbol is its mascot Blaze. Blaze is a phoenix, a mythical bird that rises from ashes to experience a renewed life. The phoenix appears in Egyptian, Arabian, Chinese, Russian and native American lore and in all instances symbolizes strength, vision, inspiration and survival. Blaze was created by Trevor Stone Irvin of Irvin Productions in Atlanta.
The phoenix was an ideal mascot for the 1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games and later for BlazeSports America. It has long been the symbol of Atlanta’s rebirth after its devastation in the American Civil War. But most importantly, it is the personification of the will, perseverance and determination of youth and adults with physical disability to achieve full and productive lives.
Blaze, with his bright colors, height and broad wing span, reflects the traits, identified in a focus group of athletes with disability, as those they believed best represented the drive to succeed of persons with physical disability who pursue sports as recreation and as a competitive endeavor.

Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night

Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night is the second solo album by British singer-songwriter Peter Hammill. It followed in the aftermath of the breakup of Hammill's band Van der Graaf Generator, and (as with many of Hammill's solo albums from this period) other ex-members of Van der Graaf Generator perform on the album.
The album was produced by John Anthony at Rockfield Studios, Wales, for the first time using pre-recorded parts done by Peter Hammill in his home studio in Worth. For final mixing the then much better equipped Trident Studios were used. The album was released in May 1973 on Charisma Records.
Some of the songs ("German Overalls" and "In the End") relate to Van der Graaf Generator's decision to split, following an exhausting, demoralising and poverty-stricken experience of being a touring rock band. "German Overalls" name-checks bandmates Hugh Banton and David Jackson.
Hammill has continued to perform "Easy to Slip Away" in concert to the present day. The song relates to him losing touch with student housemates Mike and actress Susan Penhaligon (who were also namechecked in the Van der Graaf Generator song "Refugees").
The complex and atmospheric "(In the) Black Room/The Tower" was originally planned for inclusion on Van der Graaf Generator's album following "Pawn Hearts", an album that because of the band's split never came to be. But the song was already performed on stage by Van der Graaf Generator in 1972, and a recording of it from July 1972 rehearsals (albeit in bad audio quality) is included on the compilation "Time Vaults". The album version from "Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night" features Van der Graaf Generator's ex-members Banton, Jackson and Evans. Later, when the band reformed in 1975 and 1976, "(In the) Black Room" was again part of their live sets, and also during their 2005 reunion.
Cover.
The cover was designed by Paul Whitehead, who also was the artist for "Fool's Mate" as well as sleeves for Van der Graaf Generator ("The Least We Can Do is Wave to Each Other" and "Pawn Hearts") and Charisma labelmates Genesis ("Trespass", "Nursery Cryme" and "Foxtrot"). It shows Peter Hammill's astrological sign Scorpio twice, as a painting of a real scorpion and as part of a personal logo which Hammill introduced with this album and which would appear on the covers of many coming releases. The photo of Hammill on the front side was taken by Bettina Hohls in Hamburg.

Planet Rock (radio station)

Planet Rock is a British digital radio station and network owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK. The station broadcasts classic rock music. 
As of December 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 956,000 listeners according to RAJAR.
Overview.
The station was established in 1999, initially run by the GWR Group as part of the launch lineup of Digital One stations. Ahead of GCap's purchase by Global, the station was sold to Malcolm Bluemel's 'Rock Show' consortium in 2008, and from there was sold on to become part of Bauer Radio’s portfolio of brands in 2013.
Planet Rock is a digital-only service, transmitting on the DAB network (and through digital TV and online platforms). It is available nationally Online, and to some locations via DAB.
On 1 March 2016, Planet Rock ceased on national DAB, transferring to the part-national Sound Digital multiplex, losing transmission in Devon, Cornwall, parts of Scotland, Wales, East Anglia and other areas of the UK. Some of these areas regained access to the station with the introduction of additional transmitters to the SDL network in autumn 2018.
History.
Planet Rock was founded in 1999 as the only classic rock radio station in the UK at that time.
On 11 February 2008, the previous owner GCap Media (now Global Radio), announced that the station would close by 31 March 2008, along with sister station theJazz, unless a buyer was found. According to a statement by former presenter Fish, this was not due to the profitability of Planet Rock itself, which had been reported to be good, but rather to GCap's overall financial state. The station's relative popularity on digital radio brought controversy to the closure threat. Although theJazz ceased broadcasting on schedule, a campaign by listeners meant that a number of buyers expressed interest in Planet Rock, including a consortium publicly headed by Queen guitarist Brian May.
On 4 June 2008, the station was sold to a consortium led by Malcolm Bluemel and supported by Tony Iommi, Ian Anderson, Gary Moore, and Fish. There was no break in transmission and the programming remained unchanged.
On 25 September 2012, it was reported that Malcolm Bluemel was looking for a buyer for the station.
On 6 February 2013, the station was sold to Bauer Media for a deal worth between £1 million and £2 million.
On 23 May 2013, Bauer Media announced that the output of Planet Rock would become available on FM in the West Midlands on the frequency used by Kerrang! Radio in Birmingham from 14 June 2013. All programming now comes from London with the Birmingham studios closed and Kerrang! continuing in a different form on digital platforms.
From 8am on 7 September 2015, the 105.2 FM frequency was taken over by Absolute Radio.
From 1 March 2016, Planet Rock moved from the Digital One DAB multiplex to the Sound Digital DAB multiplex. Devon, Cornwall, parts of Scotland and Wales and some other areas could not receive Planet Rock on the new multiplex. In late 2017/early 2018, new transmitters started at Pontop Pike and Ely, which widened the listening area of stations broadcasting via the Sound Digital ensemble. On 16 October 2023, Planet Rock converted to the DAB+ format, along with several other Bauer stations on SDL; this allowed Planet Rock to broadcast in stereo on digital radio again after a decade in mono, and freed up capacity which allowed sibling stations including Absolute Classic Rock and Kerrang! Radio to join the national lineup. A mono broadcast of Planet Rock was added to local DAB in certain areas at the same time, for the benefit of users of older receivers not compatible with DAB+.
It promotes and runs its own events, notably 'Rockstock', an indoor rock festival. In 2017, Planet Rock launched its own magazine, also called "Planet Rock", as a replacement for "Kerrang!" in Bauer's portfolio of music magazines. The magazine was edited by Paul Brannigan and was published once every two months until 2020, when it was decided that a number of titles (such as "Q") would be sold on to other publishers, with "Planet Rock" magazine closing so the brand could be kept by Bauer for the radio station.
On 13 December 2023, Planet Rock was removed from Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media, along with every other radio station owned by Bauer Media on either of the three platforms, including Absolute Radio, Absolute Radio 80s, Absolute Radio 90s, Absolute Radio Classic Rock, Hits Radio, Greatest Hits Radio, Kiss, Magic and Jazz FM.
Notable presenters.
Since 2006 Planet Rock has featured a number of rock star presenters, who have either fronted limited-run series or hosted long running weekly or monthly shows.
The syndicated Alice Cooper radio show was edited in the UK for a breakfast audience as the "Breakfast With Alice Cooper" show, which ran in the 69am slot until 17 January 2011 when his show became "Nights With Alice Cooper". With the cessation of the syndicated Alice Cooper programme in September 2023, Planet Rock replaced it with UK-produced shows hosted by Ian Danter and Jen Thomas.
Presenters include Def Leppard singer Joe Elliott, who has presented a weekly Saturday evening show at 5pm since June 2010; Thunder singer Danny Bowes presents a weekly show every Sunday from 10am - 12pm; Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses and Susan Holmes McKagan, who present a weekly show on Saturdays at 7pm; and former Little Angels and current Wayward Sons frontman Toby Jepson on Sunday afternoons from 5 - 7pm.
Other presenters who have hosted shows on Planet Rock include: Rick Wakeman hosted a Saturday morning show for five years until December 2010; Gary Moore hosted the "Blues Power" series in 2008; Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi presented two series of "Black Sunday" for the station; Jethro Tull singer Ian Anderson presented a series called "Under The Influence"; Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera presented two series for the station in 2007 and 2009 which looked at influential guitar players and guitar playing styles; Former Marillion frontman Fish hosted two series of "Fish On Fridays"; Thin Lizzy guitarist Scott Gorham hosted one series which aired in 2010; Europe singer Joey Tempest hosted a series on Sunday evenings until early 2011; Francis Rossi of Status Quo hosted a thirteen-part series until June 2011; Al Murray hosted on Sunday mornings until 2015; and the Hairy Bikers' "Hairy Rock Show" ran on Sundays from 2015 - 2020.

Birla Vidya Mandir

Birla Vidya Mandir in Nainital is a residential boarding school for boys in India which was founded on 17th of July 1947 just before Indian Independence. The school is mainly the product of the vision of Govind Ballabh Pant, an Indian independence activist.
BVM houses one of the world's highest altitude school playing field and swimming pool . 
It is located on the high peaks of the main town Nainital . It is approx 2500 m above the sea level and it's also 500 m above the main town &amp; tourist destination Nainital which is itself approx 2000 m above sea level.
The yearly temperature of the school varies from approximately (-5 degree Celsius to 25 degree Celsius)
The annual fees to study in this school is approx 4,00,000 INR . 
The school also has a Boards Preparation Facility at Lucknow (Moti Mahal,Lucknow) which is functional from the End of December to Mid February for the Class 10 &amp; 12 students so that they can prepare for their upcoming board exams and pass out with flying colours .
The Current Campus of the School was built in the 1870s as Oak Openings High School and the naturalist and story teller Jim Corbett studied at it. In 1905, Oak Openings was amalgamated with the Philander Smith Institute of Mussoorie, resulting in the Philander Smith College. In the wake of the Second World War, Hallett War School was built on the same campus, established for the children of the British who were in India at that time due to the war.
Birla Vidya Mandir came into existence in 1947, when Shree G. D. Birla bought the estate.
Before India achieved its independence, Pant wanted to start a public school; a donation from Ghanshyam Das Birla, a philanthropist and industrialist, made this possible. Pant then used the estate of Philander Smith, which had housed the Hallett War School during India's war years, to create Birla Vidya Mandir.
The school takes admissions from Class 4 to Class 12 mainly via an entrance examination and a short interview . Though an English medium school, the ethos is totally Indian. Prayers in Sanskrit are held before every meal and students celebrate the festivals of India.
The school is affiliated to CBSE Delhi and is a member of Indian Public School's Conference (IPSC), National Progressive Schools' Conference(NPSC), CBSE Sahodaya School Complex and International Confederation of Principals (ICP).
The school is 330 km to the northeast of Delhi in the Central Himalayan township of Nainital. Its campus is in area set at the top of a ridge, called "Sher-Ka-Danda" overlooking the lake, above the town and above sea level. It is connected by a motorable road.
History.
The estate was first owned by J.W. Waugh, and it was close to where the GB Pant Hospital (Ramsay Hospital) now stands.
"Situated just below the summit of Sher-ka-danda, the most easterly of the peaks surrounding Nainital and just above St Asaph Road", writes Martin Booth, "it commanded a stunning panoramic view of the town, the tal and the drop to the plains of India". The much expanded Birla Vidya Mandir stands in the hoary campus of the Oak Opening High School the vestiges of which still survive in the guise of much renovated Gandhi House and in all probability the Administrative Block and Library, described by Martin Booth as “Jim's original school surviving as a house close to the main building".
Jim Corbett, the famous naturalist and story teller from Nainital, attended Oak Openings School. Some of the Jim's biographers speak of the school being operated and co-owned by a ruthless and cruel ex-Indian Army Officer who was known to his 70 pupils as 'Dead Eye Dick' "for his aim both with a rifle and a bamboo cane was exceedingly accurate". It became a favourite memory of Jim's, in his later years, to remark how Oak Openings was the site of the shooting of the last mountain quail ("Ophrysia supercilosa") in 1876, driving it into extinction.
In 1905, the Philander Smith Institute of Mussoorie, founded by Mrs. Smith, widow of Mr. Philander Smith of Illinois, was moved to Nainital and "amalgamated" with the Oak Opening Boys' High School. The result was the Philander Smith College with Rev. FS Ditto as its first principal. Describing the development and expansion of Philander Smith College, Deputy Commissioner of Nainital JM Clay wrote in his monograph ("Nainital, A Historical and Descriptive Account", 1927) that "The extensive buildings which now exist have been built gradually since then, and a large dormitory block has recently been constructed. The site is over 7,500 feet above sea-level and is the highest school site in India, probably in the world". Here the building being referred to is the imposing 'Ashok Bhavan' then called the 'Hurricane House.' Incidentally, Orde Wingate of Chindit Circus fame, who was born on 26 February 1903 in a house called Montrose in Nainital, had his early schooling in all probability at Philander Smith College. Despite their birthplace being the same, Jim never met the "sword and Bible" general Wingate. However, as a Lieutenant Colonel and senior instructor in jungle craft, he trained some of Orde Wingate's 'Chindits' at Chhindwara in the then Central Province.
An article by AG Atkins, the pastor of the Union Church for two summers at Nainital and better known for his translation of Ram Charit Manas, published in the "Hindustan Times Sunday Magazine" on 14 August 1956 says that Jim and his sister Maggie were the most awaited guests at the Philander Smith College and its sister institution the Wellesley (now the DSB College of the Kumaun University). Installing Maggie on the dais in the central hall of what now is known as Gandhi House he would lecture on his favourite subject, the Jungle Telegraph. "A tiger is coming, he would announce, and then mimic a series of bird calls: the jungle babbler, drongo, peafowl, etc. One evening after Corbett had screened his first tiger film and given his wildlife lecture at Philander Smith College, the pastor walked Corbett half way home to the lake from the college. After sometime the priest asked him what made a hunter a photographer, and the response of Jim as records Atkins was "It required much more of my skill and gives me an even greater thrill to get good pictures of my animals than when I used to hunt just to kill".

Hog's pudding

Hog's pudding is a type of sausage produced in Cornwall and Devon. Popular variants of the recipe consist of pork meat and fat, suet, bread, as well as oatmeal or pearl barley formed into a large sausage—also known as 'groats pudding' and are very similar to a white pudding, whereas other versions of the recipe contain a high percentage of offal such as lung and liver and can more accurately be described as a sort of West Country haggis. It is much spicier than white pudding as it contains black pepper, cumin, basil and garlic. The sausage is usually around two inches in diameter.

Diamond tool

A diamond tool is a cutting tool with diamond grains fixed on the functional parts of the tool via a bonding material or another method. As diamond is a superhard material, diamond tools have many advantages as compared with tools made with common abrasives such as corundum and silicon carbide.
History.
In "Natural History", Pliny wrote "When an "adamas" is successfully broken it disintegrates into splinters so small as to be scarcely visible. These are much sought after by engravers of gems and are inserted by them into iron tools because they make hollows in the hardest materials without difficulty."
Advantages.
Diamond is one of the hardest natural materials on earth; much harder than corundum and silicon carbide. Diamond also has high strength, good wear resistance, and a low friction coefficient. So when used as an abrasive, it has many obvious advantages over many other common abrasives.
Advantages of diamond grinding tools.
Diamond can be used to make grinding tools, which have the following advantages:
Categories.
There are thousands of kinds of diamond tools. They can be categorized by their manufacturing methods and their uses.
Categories by manufacturing method.
According to their manufacturing methods or bond types, diamond tools can be categorized to the following way:
Categories by use.
If categorized by use, there are diamond grinding tools, diamond cutting tools (e.g., diamond coated twist drill bits), diamond drilling tools, diamond sawing tools (e.g., diamond saw blades), diamond drawing dies, etc.
Applications.
Applicable materials.
Diamond tools are suitable to process the following materials:
As diamonds can react with Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, V under the high temperatures generated in the grinding processes, normally diamond tools are not suitable to process steels, including common steels and various tough alloy steels, while the other superhard tool, cubic boron nitride (CBN) tool, is suitable to process steels. The tools made with common abrasives (e.g. corundum and silicon carbide) can also do the task.
Applied domains.
Diamond tools are used in the following domains:
Besides what are listed above, there are also other domains where diamond tools are applied, for example, in medicine, Venezuelan scientist Humberto Fernandez Moran invented the diamond knife for use in delicate surgeries in 1955.
Apart from its use as an abrasive due to its high hardness, diamond is also used to make other products for its many other good properties such as high heat-conductivity, low friction coefficient, high chemical stability, high resistivity and high optical performances. These applications include coatings on bearings and CDs, acting as lens and thermistors, making high-voltage switches and sensors, etc.
Some examples of diamond tools.
Diamond dressing tools.
Diamond dressers consist of single-point or multipoint tools brazed to a steel shank, and used for the trueing and dressing of grinding wheels. The tools come in several types, including: grit impregnated, blade type, crown type, and disc type. The advantages of multipoint over single-point tools are:
PCD cutting tools.
Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is formed in a large High Temperature-High Pressure (HT-HP) press, as either a diamond wafer on a backing of carbide, or forming a "vein" of diamond within a carbide wafer or rod.
Most wafers are polished to a mirror finish, then cut with an electrical discharge machining (EDM) tool into smaller, workable segments that are then brazed onto the sawblade, reamer, drill, or other tool. Often they are EDM machined and/or ground an additional time to expose the vein of diamond along the cutting edge. These tools are mostly used for the machining of nonmetallic and nonferrous materials.
The grinding operation is combined with EDM for several reasons. For example, according to Modern Machine Shop, the combination allows a higher material removal rate and is therefore more cost effective. Also, the EDM process slightly affects the surface finish. Grinding is used on the affected area to provide a finer final surface. The Beijing Institute of Electro-Machining attributes a finer shaping and surface geometry to the combination of the two processes into one.
The process itself is accomplished by combining the two elements from each individual process into one grinding wheel. The diamond graphite wheel accomplishes the task of grinding, while the graphite ring around the existing wheel serves as the EDM portion. However, since diamond is not a conductive material, the bonding in the PCD work piece must be ample enough to provide the conductivity necessary for the EDG process to work.
Polycrystalline diamond tools are used extensively in automotive and aerospace industries. They are ideal for speed machining (9000 surface feet per minute or higher) in tough and abrasive aluminum alloys, and high-abrasion processes such as carbon-fiber drilling and ceramics. The diamond cutting edges make them last for extended periods before replacement is needed. High volume processes, tight tolerances, and highly abrasive processes are ideal for diamond tooling.
Polycrystalline diamond compacts.
In the late 1970s, General Electric pioneered the technology of polycrystalline diamond compacts (PDCs) as a replacement for natural diamonds in drill bits. PDCs have been used to cut through crystalline rock surfaces for extended periods of time in lab environments, and these capabilities have now been implemented in harsh environments throughout the world.
As of August 2000, the U.S. Department of Energy claimed that nearly one-third of the total footage drilled worldwide is being drilled with PDC bits, with a claimed savings of nearly $100,000 per PDC bit as compared to roller-core bits.
Diamond paste and slurry.
Diamond pastes are used for polishing materials that require a mirror finish. They are often used in metallurgical specimens, carbide dies, carbide seals, spectacle glass industry, and for polishing diamonds. Diamond paste is mainly used in industrial requirements for polishing and sharpening metal blades and other metal surfaces. The paste is not just to polish the metal blade but sharpen the cutting edge as well.
Diamond electroplated tools.
Diamond powder deposited through electroplating is used to make files (including nail files) and in small grinding applications.
Single point diamond turning tools.
Single point diamond turning (SPDT) utilizes a solid, flawless diamond as the cutting edge. The single crystalline diamond can be natural or synthetic, and is sharpened to the desired dimensions by mechanical grinding and polishing. The cutting edge of most diamond tools is sharp to tens of nanometers, making it very effective for cutting non-ferrous materials with high resolution. SPDT is a very accurate machining process, used to create finished aspherical and irregular optics without the need for further polishing after completion. The most accurate machine tool in the world, the LODTM, formerly at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, had a profile accuracy estimated at 28 nm, while most machines seek a roughness within that deviation.
SPDT is used for optics, for flat surfaces where both surface finish and unusually high dimensional accuracy are required, and when lapping would be uneconomical or impractical.
Diamond saw blades.
For high-speed gas powered cut-off saws, walk-behind saws, handheld grinders, bridge saws, table saws, tile saws, and other types of saws.
Diamond tipped grinding cups.
Typically used on hand grinders for grinding concrete or stone.
Diamond tipped core bit or holesaw.
Hollow steel tube with diamond tipped segments for drilling holes through concrete walls in the construction industry, porcelain tiles or granite worktops in the domestic industry, or also used for sample core extractions in the mining industry.
PCD tool insert.
Used in machine tools for machining ceramics and high speed aluminium.
PD tool insert.
Used in turning centers for optics and precision surfaces.
Polishing pads.
Pads with diamond crystals for polishing marble and other fine stone.
Diamond wire cutting.
Wire with diamond crystals for cutting.
Some of the features of Diamond Wire Cutting are:
Non-percussive, fumeless and quiet
Smooth cutting face
Unlimited cutting depth
Horizontal, vertical and angled cutting of circular openings up to 2500mm diameter
Plunge cutting facility which allows blind and rebated openings to be formed
Remote controlled operation for increased safety
Diamond saw chain.
For cutting stone, concrete and brick with a special chainsaw.

Johann Kremer

Johann Paul Kremer (26 December 1883 – 8 January 1965) was a German professor, physician and war criminal.
He was a professor of anatomy and human genetics at Münster University who joined the Wehrmacht on May 20, 1941. He served in the SS in the Auschwitz concentration camp as a physician from 30 August 1942 to 18 November 1942. A member of the NSDAP, he was involved in Nazi human experimentation on the prisoners of Auschwitz-Birkenau. He was sentenced to death in the Auschwitz Trial, but this sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. He was released in 1958.
Life prior to Auschwitz.
Kremer was born in Stellberg. He studied in Heidelberg, Strassburg as well as Berlin; he received his philosophy degree in 1914 and his medical degree in 1919. He also studied natural science and mathematics. He was the assistant surgeon at the surgical clinic of the University, Charité, the ward of internal diseases of the Municipal Hospital Berlin-Neukölln, the surgical clinic of the University of Cologne and prosector in the Institutes of Anatomy in Bonn and Münster. He became "Dozent" of anatomy in 1929 and was promoted there in 1936 to be professor in commission. At the same time, he was commissioned to lecture on the science of human hereditariness. He also did some writing: he mentions two articles that he wrote in the diary he kept, the first being "Inherited or Acquired? A Noteworthy Contribution to the Problem of Hereditariness of Traumatic Deformations" and the second titled "New Elements of Cell and Tissues Investigations".
Auschwitz.
Medical experiments.
The main priority of SS doctors at concentration camps throughout Nazi-occupied Europe was not to provide basic medical services to prisoners, but rather to give the appearance of competent medical care. Following the full-scale implementation of the Final Solution, much of their time was occupied with concentration camp exterminations, sorting/selection of the newly-arrived (primarily Jewish) prisoners (e.g. for work, experimentation, or immediate extermination), direct observation of executions and gassings, experimentation, and the fabrication of causes of deaths on prisoner death certificates. The experiments conducted by SS doctors were done for three main reasons: 1) to research methods to improve the health and survivability of soldiers; 2) to lay the groundwork for post-war scientific research; and 3) to carry out the dictates of the racial policies of the Nazi Party. Some experiments were also done at the behest of pharmaceutical companies and medical institutes, for the doctors' own research interests, and to benefit the doctors' personal careers.
Kremer was particularly interested in the effects of starvation on the human body, especially on the liver, and because Kremer was responsible for examining the prisoners that sought admission to the camp infirmary, he was able to personally select the prisoners that he believed would make good test subjects for his experiments. He often performed autopsies in order to extract samples from the liver, spleen and pancreas. On several occasions in his diary, he mentions the extraction of organs and tissues (which he called "living-fresh material") from living victims, such as on October 15, 1942, when he writes, "Living-fresh material of liver, spleen and pancreas taken from an abnormal individual." Kremer's diary contains descriptions of at least five more similar instances. At his hearing on July 30, 1947, Kremer stated that "I observed the prisoners in this group [to be liquidated] carefully and whenever one of them particularly interested me because of his advanced stage of starvation, I ordered the medical orderly to reserve him and to inform me when this patient would be killed by injection."
"Special actions".
All SS doctors were required to be present at what were called "special actions", which was when the mass gassings took place. The most common victims were children, the elderly, mothers with young children and any others considered unfit to work. During his trial, Kremer described how a gassing was conducted and what his role as doctor was. The gassings were conducted in cabins located on the outskirts of the camp; the victims were transported by railway, and after they arrived, prisoners "were first driven to barracks where the victims undressed and then went naked to the gas chambers. Very often no incidents occurred, as the SS men kept people quiet, maintaining that they were to bathe and be deloused. After driving all of them into the gas chamber the door was closed and an SS man in a gas mask threw the contents of a Cyclon tin through an opening in the side wall." Kremer's role was to sit in a van along with a medical orderly ready to treat any officers that might succumb to the gas.
Executions and beatings.
Throughout Kremer's diary there are multiple occasions where he mentions being in attendance at various executions and beatings. At least four instances can be found where he mentions executions either by gun, phenol injection, or an unspecified method. He mentions briefly no fewer than three instances where he oversaw the punishment of prisoners. The physicians were required to examine the victim before the punishment and to remain during the administration of punishment; in practice however, physicians rarely, if ever, examined victims and did not openly object to the punishments.
Diary.
Kremer kept a diary of his time at Auschwitz. Interspersed with entries of mundane, day-to-day events are multiple accounts of murder, depravity, gassings and "special actions".
Trial and conviction.
After the war, Kremer was arrested by British troops and sent to an internment camp in Neuengamme. He was later extradited to Poland. Kremer was tried in the Auschwitz trials at the sitting of the Supreme Court National Tribune in Kraków throughout November and December 1947. Based on the contents of his diary and his own confessions, Kremer participated in fourteen gassings as well as multiple public executions and special actions, also known as gassings. During his testimony, he described the process by which he selected his victims, the process of gaining the necessary information for his research, and he states that:
Kremer was sentenced to death. In his clemency petition, Kremer claimed that he was asking for mercy not for his own sake, but for the sake of his research results which he claimed were ready for the public. These results, Kremer claimed, included "the building of gallstones in insects, inflammations, the problem of cancer and, finally, a satisfying answer to the question of inheritance of acquired characteristics." Kremer's petition was successful and his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by President Bolesław Bierut. Kremer was released from prison on 11 January 1958. After his return to Germany, Kremer was charged with murder by West German officials. On 29 November 1960, he was found guilty of two counts of being an accessory to murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. However, the court credited Kremer for the time he had served in Poland and allowed him to walk free. He was stripped of his civil rights for five years, and was later stripped of all of his medical titles. Kremer went on to testify in the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials. He died in 1965.

Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution

Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) is a London-based mediation and alternative dispute resolution body. It was founded as a non-profit organisation in 1990, with the support of The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and a number of British businesses and law firms, to encourage the development and use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and mediation in commercial disputes. CEDR also provides independent alternative dispute resolution for consumers who have problems with traders. Professor Karl Mackie, a barrister and psychologist, became the organisation's Chief Executive and Eileen Carroll QC (hon), a Trans-Atlantic partner with a law firm (who had been involved in the initiative to form CEDR) joined to become the Deputy Chief Executive in 1996. On 12 June 2010 it was announced in the Queen's Birthday Honours that Karl Mackie was appointed a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) by the UK Government for ‘services to mediation', the first citing of this reason for the award.
Background.
Initially CEDR's focus was, by necessity, UK-focused, where in the early 1990s mediation was not well established in business disputes. Through its campaigning and training work CEDR helped influence the civil justice system. In 1996 the then Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Harry Woolf (who now retired is Chair of CEDR's International Advisory Council), published his 'Access To Civil Justice Report' which encouraged the use of ADR, followed by the Civil Procedure Rules in 1999 which enabled judges to impose cost sanctions to either party when ADR was refused or ignored. These guidelines, along with case law (for example Dunnet v Railtrack, 2002) and subsequent clarification of the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) saw the growth of the use of ADR and in particular mediation in the UK. Parallel to this was a growth in demand for CEDR's services in dispute resolution and training. From the mid-1990s onwards CEDR's focus became international, to begin with encouraging mediation in other European countries and working on international cases, to establishing the MEDAL international mediation service provider alliance (2005) and creating the first international mediation centre in China with China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
Areas of activity.
CEDR works in four main ways.
Promotion.
CEDR states that all money raised from its activities get put into the promotion of mediation and ADR, through events, schemes and running many services at cost. CEDR, a UK registered charity (no.1060369), asks global businesses to be members to support these activities. CEDR runs a number of elements under this umbrella, which include:
The Exchange Participant Network Programme – quarterly events and newsletter for mediators around the world (over 700 members).
The European Mediation Congress – a biennial conference event always held in London, last held in 2007. In 2009 this was instead a Conference on Settlement in International Arbitration.
The Excellence in ADR Awards – another biennial event - a 20th Anniversary Awards will be held in 2010.
The Mediator Audit – again biennial, previously to coincided with the Congress and gauges the quantity and quality of mediations in the UK over the previous two years. The last audit was published May 2010.
The International Mediation Institute - as a board member of IMI since 2014, CEDR participates in setting quality standards and promoting the adoption of quality mediation around the world.
Dispute resolution.
CEDR is the dispute resolution service arm of CEDR. Any business or law firm facing a dispute can call to speak to a case adviser who will provide advice and be able to recommend an accredited mediator to resolve their dispute. CEDR Solve says it has over 130 accredited mediators on its panel of experts and with 50 mediators directly (including Lord Woolf). The service says it has advised on over 16,000 disputes to date and mediates approximately 600 major cases a year.
On November 9, 2011 it was announced that, the previous day, CEDR had acquired IDRS Ltd, the dispute resolution service of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators.
In 2007 CEDR started the Commission on International Arbitration, chaired by Lord Woolf and Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, to investigate settlement in international arbitration and to make recommendations on how arbitral institutions and tribunals can give parties greater assistance. The Commission is composed of 75 figures from the field and is also consulting 45 organisations from different jurisdictions. In 2009 the Commission published its Rules &amp; Recommendations for Settlement in International Arbitration.
CEDR also provides independent alternative dispute resolution for consumers who have problems with traders.
Training.
Training mediators for over seventeen years, its Mediator Training Skills are widely thought to be the best in the world. With a faculty of 30 experienced mediators, CEDR says over 5,000 mediators from different countries had been trained by 2009. Once passed, mediators can go on to become accredited. CEDR later branched out to offer other courses, such as a Certificate in Advanced Negotiation, Advocacy Skills for lawyers and Conflict Management for managers.
Consultancy and named clients.
Increasingly CEDR says it is called into organizations and disputes at an early stage to design a resolution system or training scheme. In 2006 CEDR announced it had been appointed by the World Bank's International Finance Corporation to introduce mediation to Pakistan. In its 2005 report CEDR said it has also worked with IBM, the Court of Appeal and the National Association of Pension Funds.
Whilst no organizations were mentioned in its 2006 annual report, in 2007 CEDR said it ran projects or consulted with the IFC and World Bank, the European Patent Office, the London Olympics 2012, the Federal Government of India, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Germanischer Lloyd Wind Energy, the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development, the Chartered Institute of Public Relations, the Ministry of Justice (UK), the National Health Service (UK), the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (UK) and UNCITRAL. The report shows that in addition to its work in the UK, in 2007 CEDR also worked in South Africa, China, the Ukraine, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Vietnam, the United States, Bosnia and Croatia.
The 2008 report names law firms it worked with as Allen &amp; Overy, Ashurst, Clifford Chance, Eversheds, Herbert Smith, Lewis Silkin, Lovells, Mayer Brown, Nabarro and Norton Rose. The businesses and organizations given are Allianz, Association for Consultancy and Engineering (ACE), Barclays, Beazley, British Waterways, Court of Appeal, Deloitte, Department for Transport (UK), Home Office (UK), Hong Kong Bar Association, Howden, International Finance Corporation, International Underwriting Association, John Laing, Lloyd's Markets Association, Medical Protection Society, PricewaterhouseCoopers, QBE, Skanska, Teceris, Thames Water, UK Intellectual Property Office, University of Southampton and the World Bank.
In its 2009 annual report it says it worked with a number of banks - Barclays, Lloyds TSB, HBOS, National Westminster Bank/Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Merrill Lynch and EBRD. Other organizations included are Beazley, Home Office (UK), John Laing, BBC, Sony, Panasonic, EDF Energy, Metropolitan Police, the Arts Council, Samsung, The Tribunals Service, ACAS, BDO Stoy Hayward, British Sugar, NHS Primary Healthcare Trusts, Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb, University of Cardiff, University of Birmingham, City University, Wolverhampton University, the Medical Protection Society, Lloyds Market Association, IFC and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)

"I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)" is a single recorded by the Temptations and released on Motown Records' Gordy label during the spring of 1968. The song is the last with lyrics by Rodger Penzabene, and was the final Temptations single to feature David Ruffin as lead singer.
Both "I Could Never Love Another" and the previous Temptations release, "I Wish It Would Rain", drew from Penzabene's real-life heart break over learning that his wife had been unfaithful. Unable to handle the extreme pain and unable to leave his wife, he wrote the songs as personal statements to her, publicizing the pain she caused him. After both songs were completed and recorded, Penzabene committed suicide.
David Ruffin portrays the narrator of "I Could Never Love Another", who asks his wife why she is suddenly ending their relationship after all their years together and all her proclamations of love. He then tells her that despite her infidelity, despite all the pain she's caused him, he'll never find love with another woman. "I Could Never Love Another" proved to be Ruffin's final performance as lead singer on a Temptations single, as Ruffin was fired from the group in June 1968 for what was considered increasingly unprofessional behavior and ego clashes.
"I Could Never Love Another" was the second single from the 1968 album "The Temptations Wish It Would Rain". It peaked at number 13 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, and reached the number-one position on the Billboard R&amp;B Singles chart. Following one more single from the LP, the Eddie Kendricks-led "Please Return Your Love to Me", the Temptations forged ahead into psychedelic soul territory with their new single, "Cloud Nine", and their new lead singer, Dennis Edwards.
"Billboard" described the single as "another sure-fire winner." "Cash Box" described it as "pop-styled blues" with "outstanding lead, delightful backup vocals and a terrific orchestral impact."

Jonathan Moreira

Jonathan Cícero Moreira (born 27 February 1986), sometimes known as just Jonathan, is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a right-back.
He also holds Italian citizenship.
During his Italian career, he was ironically nicknamed "Divino Jonathan" (Italian for “Divine Jonathan”).
Club career.
Cruzeiro.
Jonathan made his professional debut in the Campeonato Brasileiro for Cruzeiro against Flamengo in a 6–2 away defeat on 19 December 2004. He scored his first goal as professionist against Corinthians in a 3–0 away win on 25 August 2007.
Santos.
In December 2010, Jonathan signed with Santos for €2 million (with Cruzeiro retained 50% registration rights). Santos paid €1.2 million to acquire 30% while Santos's investment partner Terceira Estrela Investimentos S/A (TEISA) acquired 20% for €800,000. He signed a 4-year contract with €15 million release clause. He won Campeonato Paulista and Copa Libertadores with Santos.
Inter Milan.
On 13 July 2011, it was announced that Jonathan would leave Santos to train with Serie A giants Inter Milan, pending the finalization of the transfer. Two days later, on 15 July, he officially became an Inter player, signing a four-year contract. Jonathan made his Inter debut on 11 September 2011 in week two of 2011–12 Serie A, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4–3 away loss to Palermo. Three days later Jonathan made his Champions League debut, playing the entire match on Matchday 1 against Turkish side Trabzonspor in a 0–1 loss at the San Siro.
Loan to Parma.
In January 2012, Moreira moved to Parma on loan until the end of the season where he established himself as the team's regular right wing-back. He debuted with the club on 28 January, coming on as a substitute at half time in place of Brandão in a 1–1 draw against Catania. He scored his first goal with Parma on 11 April 2012 in a 2–0 win at Stadio Ennio Tardini against newly promoted Novara. He helped Parma to finish the season in 8th place.
Return to Inter.
After playing for Parma in the final round, Moreira returned to Milan and was included in the 20-men squad to Indonesia and playing in both exhibition matches. In the playoffs for the Europa League, he played the two legs against Hajduk Split. On 17 April, Moreira scored his first goal for the Nerazzurri in the second leg of the Coppa Italia's semi-final in San Siro against Roma. The match ended 2–3 for the visitors with Jonathan scoring Inter's first goal after a back heel assist by Tommaso Rocchi. On 21 April, Jonathan assisted Tommaso Rocchi for the only goal of the match against Parma, which was scored in 82nd minute, salvaging the club's hopes for qualifying for Europe.
At the end of the season, Inter finished 2012–13 Serie A in a disappointing 9th place, which meant they failed to qualify for either UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League for the first time since 1999-2000. For this disappointing position, Stramaccioni was sacked and replaced by Walter Mazzarri, where Jonathan secured a more regular place at starting lineup.
On 18 August 2013, in the opening match of the 2013–14 season, against Cittadella in third round of Coppa Italia, Jonathan scored his first goal of the season after he beat goalkeeper Raffaele Di Gennaro with a header, following a cross from Fredy Guarín. Inter won the match 4–0. In first match of the new season in Serie A, Jonathan assisted the first goal of Yuto Nagatomo in a 2–0 win over against Genoa, helping the team to make a fine start. In second match on 1 September, Jonathan made his second assist of the season by providing the pass for Rodrigo Palacio opening goal of the 3–0 away win against Catania. On 26 September, Jonathan scored his first league goal with Inter in a 2–1 win at San Siro against Fiorentina, giving his team the advantage in the 83rd minute after a powerful shot from inside the box. One month later, Jonathan scored the opener in a 4–2 win over newly promoted Hellas Verona, that was ruled out as an own-goal. Jonathan scored for the second time in Serie A, netting the equalizer in a 1–1 away draw against Bologna on 24 November. Jonathan continued his fine form, supplying his third assist of the season in a 3–3 draw against Parma at the San Siro, assisting Rodrigo Palacio in the 44th minute of the match.
Fluminense and Athletico Paranaense.
On 14 September 2015, Jonathan returned to Brazil and signed for Fluminense until the end of the following year. On 22 December 2016, he moved to Atlético Paranaense.
International career.
Jonathan has represented Brazil at under-17 level, playing in 2003 FIFA U-17 World Championship. Brazil reached the final where Jonathan played the full 90 minutes and helped the "Seleção" beat Spain in a 1–0 win. Jonathan has never been capped at senior level for Brazil, which leaves the door open for either a Brazilian or Italian call-up.

Cadillac Man

Cadillac Man is a 1990 American black comedy film directed by Roger Donaldson, starring Robin Williams and Tim Robbins.
The plot of the film centers on car salesman Joey O'Brien (Williams), whose life is consumed by turmoil, which all comes to a head when his dealership is taken hostage by Larry (Robbins), a love-crazed motorcyclist.
The film received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $27.6 million against its $15 million budget.
Plot.
Queens car salesman Joey O'Brien must deal with the ever-increasing pressures in his life: he has an ex-wife demanding alimony, a daughter who is missing, a married mistress and a single mistress who are both desperately in love with him, and a two-day deadline to either sell twelve cars or lose his job. In addition, he has an outstanding loan from a Mafia don; a loan that he must either quickly repay or lose his life.
On the day of the big dealership car sale (and the final day of O'Brien's deadline), the car dealership is taken hostage by Larry, a motorcyclist toting an AK-47 who believes that his wife is cheating on him. Joey manages to talk Larry out of doing any harm, by claiming that he is the one who is sleeping with Larry's wife. As police surround the dealership, Joey and Larry begin to bond, and Joey convinces Larry to give himself up.
Not realizing that Larry's gun is not loaded, the police wound him after most of the hostages have already been released. Joey promises to remain with him while he recovers, and confesses that he had never actually slept with Larry's wife. The crisis resolves all of Joey's problems: his mistresses learn of each other and dump him, his daughter returns, his job is secure, the Mafia don (whose son was among the hostages) forgives his debt, and he begins to reconcile with his ex-wife.
Production.
To prepare for his role in the film, Williams spent time in car dealerships in Queens, New York.
Release.
The film opened at number 2 at the box office on May 18, 1990, behind "Bird on a Wire". Its total worldwide gross was $27,627,310.
Reception.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 62%, based on 13 reviews. Metacritic gives it a score of 50 out of 100, based on 21 critic reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a "B−" grade on scale of A+ to F.
"Chicago Sun-Times" critic, Roger Ebert, had mixed feelings about the film, giving it a two stars out of four, stating, "My problems with "Cadillac Man" were probably inspired more by false expectations than by anything on the screen, and maybe if Robbins had come crashing in through the window in the first scene I would have liked it more."
"Variety" thought that the film had "the distinction of being the loudest film of 1990 and one of the worst".

My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)

"My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)" is the solo debut single for former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin, released on Motown Records in early 1969 (see 1969 in music). The song was written by Harvey Fuqua, Johnny Bristol, Pam Sawyer, and James Roach. Fuqua and Bristol handled the recording's production.
Background.
Ruffin had been dismissed from the Temptations in June 1968 for what has been repeatedly deemed increasingly unprofessional behavior. The song was originally intended to be sung by the Temptations when Ruffin was still the group's front man. David Ruffin had always been signed as a single artist which was part of the issue with the group who had a collective contract.
Once he left, the song was given to him.
The song, with its melody and intro based upon the classical music piece "Frühlingslied" by Felix Mendelssohn, is a bittersweet ballad in the style of "Since I Lost My Baby", "All I Need", "I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)", "(Loneliness Made Me Realize) It's You That I Need", "(I Know) I'm Losing You" and "I Wish It Would Rain", Ruffin, as the narrator, sings of the extensive pain he has felt since his lover has left him. All throughout the song, Ruffin asks his lover why she left him, what he did wrong that drove her away, and professes to her that without her, his life is meaningless. Singing backup for Ruffin on the recording are The Originals, who the same year would score a hit of their own with "Baby I'm For Real". As to the distinct piccolo flute on the recording, Dayna Hartwick stated 
Chart performance.
"My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)" was the focal point of Ruffin's debut solo LP, "My Whole World Ended". It peaked at number nine on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and number two on the "Billboard" R&amp;B Singles chart. Only one more of Ruffin's solo singles, 1975's Walk Away from Love, would match its success.

Certified mortgage planner

In the United States certified mortgage planner is a designation for the purpose of establishing a new professional category in the mortgage sector: one that arose as a response to criticisms of the mortgage banking industry. The term "mortgage planner" has been adopted as a generic niche term for mortgage originators who choose to assist borrowers on a more personal level by incorporating the mortgage decision with a borrowers short and long-term financial objectives. The term "certified mortgage planner" is an effort to validate through education and subsequent certification a mortgage originator that has had specific training for the purpose of incorporating the mortgage decision with a Borrowers short and long-term financial objectives.
Origins of the term.
The terms "certified mortgage planning" and "certified mortgage planner" were first used by the NAMP ("National Association of Mortgage Professionals"). The term Mortgage Planner was first coined by Tim Hester to mark a clear distinction between the new approach to mortgage origination and the existing practices encompassed by mortgage brokering.
The effort to create a certification process around the mortgage planning concept was stemmed from those within the mortgage industry desiring to combat the negative effects of the mortgage industry having been commoditized.
Proponents of mortgage planning, such as NAMP, argue that mortgage brokers have no fiduciary obligation to the consumer and are essentially independent contractors. This is in contrast to other related occupations, such as financial advisors and real estate agents, where agency is more clearly defined.
While mortgage brokering license requirements do exist, they are maintained on a state level, and enforcement is often difficult. This factor, in conjunction with the rise in unconventional mortgage products between 1999 and 2006, has led to some brokers taking advantage of unsuspecting consumers.
Tools of the trade.
The mortgage planner uses many tools in his practice, which in conjunction with their education allow them to create a "mortgage plan" for their client. These tools often include, but are not limited to, advanced software to compare mortgage products in a side be side comparison, credit scoring services to determine the best way to help a client to qualify for a particular program, and additional financial or debt management programs which create additional options for the client and the mortgage planner to use to achieve their goals.

Birmingham Jazz

Birmingham Jazz (or BJazz) is a voluntary, non-profit organisation responsible for promoting and commissioning jazz and related contemporary music in the UK.
Organisation.
The Founder of BJazz was George West who decided a regular club venue was needed and set one up; its first base was the splendid Grand Hotel in the city centre. George was supported by a group of jazz fan volunteers including the late William Shaw (who have also started JazzCoventry the year before) &amp; Phil Rose who was destined to become the Artistic Director in 2012. For five years a regular programme was presented in the Hotel’s Grovenor Suite and Banqueting Hall. One notable landmark was an annual gig by Stan Tracey, who subsequently became the Honorary President. From the early 1980s an expanded group of enthusiasts carried BJazz forward, creating a Charity and Company status. The venue changed to the Strathallen on Hagley Road presenting the new jazz stars part of the 1980’s explosion of interest. In subsequent years the organisation become established with regular financial support from Arts Council England and Birmingham City Council venues around the city were used including the Midlands Arts Centre, Custard Factory and Birmingham Conservatoire. The programme of work expanded to include education projects and commissioning new works.

P107

The P107 was a World War II French half-track.
History.
In the 1920s and 1930s Citroën developed a long line of half-tracks based on the Kégresse patent. In 1934, the company introduced its newest and more powerful P107 model as a successor to the Citroën-Kégresse P17. But before mass production could take place, Citroën went bankrupt and its new owner, Michelin, chose to focus on the civilian markets. Unic was therefore able to acquire a license for the Kégresse patent, and took over the production of the P107. From 1937, the vehicles built by Unic received various designations, such as P 107 B, P 107 BU or P 107 U1.
The first order was made in 1935. Two main variants of the P107 were accepted in French military service: a light prime mover for the 75 mm, short 105 mm Bourges and short 105 mm Schneider guns, and a platform cargo transport for engineer units. A third version was also delivered to transmission units. 1,274 examples were delivered before the war and 1,896 more were delivered until June 1940.
Foreign use.
60 P 107s were ordered by Poland on 27 August 1939 but on 22 September they were recalled to France while en route to Poland.
During World War II, the Germans used these captured half-tracks extensively under the name "leichter Zugkraftwagen 37 U304(f)" to tow various anti-tank guns.
With German half-tracks in short supply, Major Alfred Becker of the 21. Panzerdivision (which in 1944 was stationed near Caen in Normandy) suggested converting captured French vehicles. He ordered the conversion of available Unic half-tracks into "leichter Schützenpanzerwagen" (light armoured personnel carriers).

Rajinder Singh (spiritual master)

Rajinder Singh (born 20 September 1946) is the head of the international, non-profit organization Science of Spirituality (SOS), also known in India as the Sawan Kirpal Ruhani Mission. To his disciples he is known as Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj. Singh is known for his work toward promoting inner and outer peace through spirituality and meditation on the inner Light and Sound.
Biography.
Life and career.
Singh earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) Madras, India and his master's degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT (Illinois Institute of Technology) in Chicago, Illinois. He received his spiritual education from two of India's leading spiritual Masters: Kirpal Singh (1894–1974) and Darshan Singh (1921–1989). His training in both disciplines has helped him express age-old spiritual teachings in clear, logical language. Rajinder has had a twenty-year career in science, computers, and communications.
He is the son of Darshan Singh (1921–1989) and grandson of Kirpal Singh (1894–1974).
Singh stated that, "One of the greatest benefits of meditation is that we will not only have peace in our own homes, but will contribute to the peace of the world. Throughout the world, people are praying for peace. But, as the expression goes, charity begins at home. World peace can only become a reality when each of us individually has peace in our own circles. If we bring peace into our individual spheres, the effect will be cumulative, and it will contribute to world peace. In 2000, He was part of a delegation of hundreds of world religious leaders who traveled to New York for the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, "an event unusual for its religious diversity and for its having convened at the United Nations," according to the "New York Times". Singh told the "Times", "When we sit and talk with them [leaders of other religions], we realize they are not much different".
Rajinder has written a number of books including "Inner and Outer Peace Through Meditation" which was #1 Barnes and Noble best-selling meditation book.
As founder of the Darshan Education Foundation, Singh has established Darshan Academy throughout India (schools that teach students from Pre-K—12). Integrating both meditation and a spiritual curriculum into a traditional academic environment, the foundation's goal is two-fold: first, to produce students whose spiritual potential is developed along with their intellect and physical well-being; and second, to inspire in each student a global view of the world, unobstructed by distinctions of race, nationality, religion, or economic status.
He was President of the 16th International World Human Unity Conference in 1998.
Philosophy.
Singh emphasizes the fundamental unity and harmony of all faiths. He says his aim is to "take the mystery out of mysticism, to help people put mysticism into action in their own lives. By doing so, they will help themselves as well as those around them attain bliss and universal love." He emphasizes meditation as the basis for peace. As he has said, "Within us is a divine spirit from which our intelligence and wisdom is derived. The process of accessing that inner divine spirit, intelligence, and wisdom is called meditation; if we transform knowledge to wisdom by meditating and experiencing the driving force behind all existence, then we have the key to human unity. This experience will transform our individual life and the lives of those around us. These individual transformations will ultimately bring unity and peace at the community, national, and global levels." (From a speech, "Moral Dimensions of Leadership" given to the United States Coast Guard Academy)
Meditation.
Meditation is a process by which a practitioner comes in contact with the Light and Sound of God already within themselves. The spiritual Masters of Science of Spirituality teach that (1) the divine current of Light and Sound reverberates in all creation; (2) by meditating on this current one can begin a journey into the inner spiritual regions; and (3) with the help and guidance of a spiritual Master, this journey ultimately culminates in God-realization and the merger of the soul with the Over-soul or God. In the Times of India, Singh states, "Human beings are blessed with a special faculty to gain spiritual knowledge. That opportunity is offered to every human being but few make use of it. One needs to meditate to make full use of the gift."
Science and spirituality.
The method of meditation taught by him is called a science because it can be practiced by people of all cultures. In this method, aspirants perform the experiment of meditation within their own selves. By doing so, the practitioner can have a inner experience of spiritual light and sound, affirming that there is something that lies beyond this physical world.
In his address given to students and faculty at IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) Mumbai, Singh states:
"“Science and spirituality make a great partnership. If those engaged in science spend time in the silence of their selves, inspiration will come and lead them to the answers they seek. If those interested in spirituality apply the scientific law of testing a hypothesis in the laboratories of their own bodies, they will find results. Each person is capable of success in proving spiritual truths. Such pursuits can make the world a better place as well as uncover the purpose of our lives.”"
Awards and honors.
Honorary doctorates.
Singh has received five honorary doctorates from various universities around the world in recognition of his work to introduce spirituality into science and education, and for his work toward human integration.
Speeches and activities.
Keynote addresses.
Singh has been invited to deliver keynotes and talks at various conferences through the years.
At the United Nations Headquarters, New York (May 2016), in his keynote address, he explained how meditation on the inner Light and Sound can lead to inner peace, which paves the way to building bridges of unity, love, and outer peace in the world. At the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, United Nations, New York City, New York (August 2000), in his address entitled "Nature of Forgiveness and Compassion" Singh stated: "Spirituality is the recognition that behind our outer names and labels, we are souls, a part of one Creator. . . . When we develop this vision we no longer see through the eyes of prejudice and discrimination.". He also shared a speech at the UN celebration for Secretary General Kofi Annan.
At the United States Coast Guard Academy (USCGA), New London, Connecticut (November 1999), addressing the members of the academy in his talk "Moral Leadership for the 21st Century," Singh provided a blueprint for successful leadership.
At the Sixth Assembly of the World Conference on Religion and Peace, in Riva del Garde, Italy (November 1994), in this talk "Curing the World’s Pain," he stated: "To heal the world, we must heal ourselves. To bring peace to the world, we must have peace ourselves. We can attain this through meditation."
Symposium of the World Conference on Religion and Peace in Vienna, Austria (1998). In his address, "“Building Peace in the World,”" he explored the importance of meditation as the way to connect to our soul and to the divinity that exists within us. He said: "“When we recognize that all people of the world are made of the same Light that we are made of, we will feel the pain of others. . . . Our outlook will be a global one, and we will make choices that will benefit our global brothers and sisters.”"
Veggie Fest.
He promoted the Veggie Fest, the vegetarian food and lifestyle festival in North America. Co-sponsored by the Science of Spirituality and over 30 vendors, the festival celebrates the benefits and joys of a vegetarian lifestyle. It is held in Lisle/Naperville, Illinois. In 2016, Veggie Fest celebrated its 11th year, launching its largest festival to date: Over 800 volunteers from around the world welcomed tens of thousands of visitors during its two-day program. Each year, participants attend this festival which includes: an international food court; vendor tents and food demos from noted area chefs; live music, a blood donation drive; a “Take the Vegetarian Challenge” tent, and a “Take the Meditation Challenge” tent.
Visitors can also attend the “Spirituality &amp; Health Symposium” where doctors and health practitioners speak throughout the day on different aspects of the vegetarian diet and its impact on one's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Singh delivers the Keynote on both days.
Publications.
Various children's books were also published.

Domenico Sarro

Domenico Natale Sarro, also Sarri (24 December 1679 – 25 January 1744) was an Italian composer.
Born in Trani, Apulia, he studied at the Neapolitan conservatory of S. Onofrio. He composed extensively in the early 18th century. His opera "Didone abbandonata", premiered on 1 February 1724 at the Teatro San Bartolomeo in Naples, was the first setting of a major libretto by Pietro Metastasio. He is best remembered today as the composer of "Achille in Sciro", the opera that was chosen to open the new Teatro di San Carlo in 1737.
Of his many intermezzi, 'Dorina e Nibbio' or L'impresario delle Isole Canarie (1724) has had an extensive performance history. With a libretto by Pietro Metastasio (his only comic libretto), it was performed often and imitated internationally (with versions by Albinoni, Gasparini, Leo, Martini and others). In recent years it was performed in the State Theatre of Stuttgart, the Bochum Symphony as well as the Semperoper Dresden.
In addition to his Operas and other large scale works, Sarro has written a considerable number of vocal cantatas which show great charm and inventiveness. 'Coronatemi il crin' for Alto, two violins and continuo, is perhaps his most well known cantata.
The only known depiction of Domenico Sarro is Nicolò Maria Rossi's painting of the Viceroy at the festa of the Quattro Altari in the Harrach collection, Sarro is one of the many composers depicted as part of the Neapolitan Court (La festa dei Quattro Altari, 1745)

Heavy cake

Heavy cake or Tesen Hevva cake () is a cake, made from flour, lard, butter, milk, sugar and raisins, that originated in Cornwall.
History.
Its name is derived from the pilchard (silver sardines) industry in Cornwall prior to the 20th century when a 'huer' (cliff top lookout) helped locate shoals of fish. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the huer would shout 'Hevva!, Hevva!' to alert the boats to the location of the pilchard shoals. Cornish tradition states that Hevva cake was baked by the huers on their return to their homes, the cake being ready by the time the crews returned to land. "Heva" became "hevva" and later morphed into the anglicized version "heavy". The texture of the cake itself is neither heavy nor spongy.
Flavour and appearance.
With no raising agent or egg, they are simply made from flour, lard (or more recently butter), currants, milk, salt, ginger, and cinnamon. They may also have fruit incorporated into them. The cakes have a unique texture, which some describe as a cross between a cake and a shortbread, and a distinct appearance. The bake falls somewhere between a sweet scone and a light egg-free fruit cake. The cake’s flavour is not dissimilar to the more familiar Welsh cakes (which, unlike hevva cakes, contain egg). 
The cakes are about 1/2" thick, with a criss-cross pattern scored across the top, representing the fishing nets.

Ranger Memorial

The Ranger Memorial is a tribute to the United States Army Rangers at Fort Benning), Georgia. The memorial serves as host to Ranger ceremonies such as Ranger retirement ceremonies to the graduation of the latest Rangers from the Ranger Indoctrination Program.
The original idea of the Ranger Memorial was drawn on a sketch by two Rangers in a mess hall. The idea was to form a permanent memorial to the contributions that Rangers have made to the defense of the United States and its allies throughout their long history. The construction was completed in 1994 with approximately 2,456 polished stones commemorating soldiers. In 1996, Phase II and 2,200 more memorial stones along with indirect lighting, sprinkler system, ledger stones, and a locater system for helping to find the Rangers on the walk.
The memorial is composed of a large Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife sitting between two large marble pillars as the centerpiece. This knife was issued to British Commandos and subsequently to the men of the newly formed 1st Ranger Battalion while they were training with them in Achnacarry, Scotland. This knife later became a staple of the inventory of airborne troops as well as other special operations units during WWII.
Another unique part of this monument is the walkway to the centerpiece. It is composed of “purchased” stones by former and current Rangers with their unit information. No rank is indicated on the stones of the soldiers, only the word “Ranger” as the first line.
The criteria for stone purchase are very strict and not every person can be on the “Ranger Walk”. Anyone can buy a stone on the monument, but the stone has to be for a qualified Ranger.

Myrmecophilus acervorum

Myrmecophilus acervorum is an orthopteran insect belonging to the family Myrmecophilidae (the ant-loving crickets). This continental European species is probably the most widespread and most frequently encountered member of this rather obscure family found in Europe. It is also by far the smallest orthopteran found in Western Europe, with its total adult length never exceeding .
As with other members of the family, this insect lives its whole lifecycle as an inquiline within ants' nests. "M. acervorum" lives with ants (myrmecophily) of more than 20 species. This specialized way of life has led this insect to evolve many morphological differences compared to other orthopterans, including complete absence of wings (as they never leave their host nest) and hearing organs (as they no longer use stridulation), and much reduced eyesight, as well as their very small size.
These tiny insects are dark brown with paler bands and prominent cerci, which serve as their primary sensory organs. Adults are found throughout the year, and take up to two years to reach adulthood from hatching. In this species, the females reproduce parthenogenetically.
Myrmecophily.
The species was one of the earliest myrmecophiles to be studied; its relationship with ants was first described by the Italian naturalist Paolo Savi in 1819. The species does not visually resemble an ant, but provides sufficient tactile, behavioural, and chemical cues to the ants to suppress their normal aggressive response to intruders, and to accept it in their colony.

Wake Up Little Susie

"Wake Up Little Susie" is a popular song written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and published in 1957.
The song is best known as a recording by the Everly Brothers, issued by Cadence Records as catalog number 1337. The Everly Brothers record reached No. 1 on the "Billboard" Pop chart and the "Cash Box" Best Selling Records chart, despite having been banned from Boston radio stations for lyrics that, at the time, were considered suggestive, according to a 1986 interview with Don Everly. "Wake Up Little Susie" also spent seven weeks atop the "Billboard" country chart and got to No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was ranked at No. 318 on the "Rolling Stone" magazine's list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time". In 2017, the 1957 recording by The Everly Brothers was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.
Song premise.
The song is written from the point of view of a high school boy to his girlfriend, Susie. In the song, the two go out on a date to a cinema (perhaps a drive-in), only to fall asleep during the movie. They do not wake up until 4 o'clock in the morning, well after her 10 o'clock curfew. They then contemplate the reactions of her parents and their friends. The boy fears that having stayed out so late, they've both now lost their good reputations.
Simon &amp; Garfunkel version.
Simon &amp; Garfunkel have cited the Everly Brothers as strong influences on their own music. Their live version of "Wake Up Little Susie", recorded at the duo's concert in New York's Central Park on September 19, 1981, reached #27 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 in 1982, and is the duo's last Top 40 hit.
During Simon &amp; Garfunkel's "Old Friends" tour in 2003–2004, they performed this song and others in a segment with the Everly Brothers, who toured in support.

World Professional Figure Skating Championships

The World Professional Figure Skating Championships, often referred to as Landover, was an elite made-for-TV figure skating competition. It was created by Dick Button, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, through his production company Candid Productions. It usually took place in December. For most of its existence, it was an unsanctioned professional event, meaning that skaters who participated lost their eligibility to compete in the Winter Olympic Games and other "amateur" skating events controlled by the International Skating Union.
History.
The first professional championship was held in 1973 in Tokyo, Japan (aired in 1974 on ABC Sports) . Skaters competed in three disciplines: men's singles, ladies' singles, and pair skating. However the competition was not held again until 1980, when it moved to Landover, Maryland. It was held again from 1980 to 1982 as a two-team competition. In 1983 individual competition once again resumed alongside continued team competition. 1983 also marked the first year in which ice dancing was contested. Team competition was discontinued in 1986. The last professional championship was held in 2000.
The professional championships were held in Landover, Maryland, every year until 1997, when it moved to the MCI Center in Washington, D.C. Beginning in 1990, the championship started taking the name of its sponsor. Thus the 1990 competition was called the "NutraSweet World Professional Championships". Other sponsors included Durasoft Colors, Equal, Metabolife, and Hallmark.
In 1998, the competition was sanctioned by the International Skating Union (ISU) as an "international open" or pro-am event. Because the ISU restricts the use of the title "Championships" to refer to ISU Championship events, that year the event was formally known simply as the "Equal Sweetener World Pro".
The technical content of performances was generally lower than in ISU events. Dick Button said: "In the amateur world, they count your triple jumps, and if you don't do enough they forget about your other skating. We do not make our competitors prove their merit. We let them present creative programs with as many or as few triple jumps as they wish."
In 1999, Button's Candid Productions was acquired by SFX, which was in turn acquired by Clear Channel Communications a year later. At the same time, public interest in professional skating competitions was declining, more elite skaters were choosing to retain their competition eligibility by participating only in sanctioned events, and networks were shifting towards a time-buy model which made skating events less lucrative for producers. All of these factors contributed to the competition's demise after the 2000 event.
In 2001, a successor pro competition produced by IMG under the name "Hallmark Skater's Championship" was held on the usual December date at the MCI Center. In 2002 the IMG-produced event was held again under that name, this time in Columbus, Ohio, as a sanctioned pro-am competition. This competition also ceased to be held.
In 2009 Skyeyes International Ltd purchased the rights of the World Professional Figure Skating Championships and transformed them into an international trademark with the goal to unify criteria between both events held prior.
Simultaneously the International Professional Skating Union (IPSU) under the same umbrella was being developed.
In 2016 the French company Agence Combes purchased the rights of the World Professional Figure Skating Championships.
Jaca competition.
An unrelated professional skating competition known by the same name in English was held for many years in Jaca, Spain. Its official name in Spanish was Campeonatos del Mundo de Patinaje Artístico Professional sobre Hielo. The forerunner of this event was an open professional championship for show skaters dating back to at least the 1930s that was held in England, initially under the auspices of the National Ice Skating Association of Great Britain, and later organized by the Imperial Professional Skaters Association. The event moved to Jaca with the sponsorship of the International Professional Skaters Union. During the 1980s it was a prestigious event with wide television coverage in Europe. Past winners of this event include Denise Biellmann, Robert Wagenhoffer, Gary Beacom, Scott Williams, Pierre Panayi and Lorna Brown.

First Landing (horse)

First Landing (March 7, 1956 – 1987) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse.
Background.
Sired by Turn-To, a grandson of the great Nearco, he was out of the mare Hildene, whose sire was the 1926 Kentucky Derby winner, Bubbling Over. Hildene was completely blind and died when First Landing was a yearling.
Racing career.
Nicknamed "Lazy Bones", First Landing was the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt. One of his best wins came at Saratoga in August when he took the Hopeful Stakes by five and a half lengths from First Minister.
He did not achieve the same success racing at age three. In the 1959 racing season, he finished second in the Wood Memorial Stakes. Then, after winning the Derby Trial, he was made the betting favorite for the Kentucky Derby. However, ridden by Eddie Arcaro, he finished a well-beaten third behind Sword Dancer and the winner: English-bred Tomy Lee.
Stud record.
Retired to Christopher Chenery's stud farm, First Landing sired a number of graded stakes race winners including Jim J. (1964), Balustrade (1965), Artfully (1973), Stutz Bearcat (1975), and his most important, U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Riva Ridge, who won the 1972 Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes.
Death.
First Landing died at the age of 31 in 1987.

Works of Demosthenes

Demosthenes (Greek: ; 384–322 BC) was a prominent Greek statesman and orator of ancient Athens. His orations constitute the last significant expression of Athenian intellectual prowess and provide a thorough insight into the politics and culture of ancient Greece. The "Alexandrian Canon" compiled by Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus of Samothrace recognized Demosthenes as one of the ten greatest Attic orators and logographers. Cicero acclaimed him as "the perfect orator" and the one who "has pre-eminence over all others" ("inter omnes unus excellat"), while Quintilian extolled him as "lex orandi" ("the standard of oratory").
Manuscript tradition.
Demosthenes must have written down and put into circulation most of his orations. In the next generation after his death, texts of his speeches survived in at least two places: Athens and the Library of Alexandria (early-mid third century BC). During this period, Callimachus was responsible for producing the catalogue of all the volumes contained in the Library. Demosthenes' speeches were incorporated into the body of classical Greek literature that was preserved, catalogued and studied by scholars of the Hellenistic period. From then until the fourth century AD copies of his orations multiplied at a time when Demosthenes was deemed the most important writer in the rhetorical world and every serious student of rhetoric needed access to his writings. Texts of his speeches were in a relatively good position to survive the tense period from the sixth until the ninth century AD.
Scholars have recorded 258 Byzantine manuscripts of Demosthenes' speeches and 21 of extracts. Modern editions of these speeches are based on four of these manuscripts: 
Authorship.
The authorship of many of the works attributed to Demosthenes have been disputed. Arnold Schaefer, for instance, accepted only 29 of Demosthenes' speeches as genuine. 
Some works are almost universally rejected. Most of the speeches given by Apollodoros, for instance, are widely considered to have been written by Apollodoros himself, though the first speech "Against Stephanos" has been considered authentic by many scholars.
Of these, at least two, "Against Callipus" and "Against Nicostratus", must have been composed by someone other than Demosthenes, as he would have been too young at the time they were composed. Similarly, "virtually everyone" believes that "On the Halonessus" was written and delivered by Hegesippus rather than Demosthenes.
At the other end of the spectrum, some works which have been doubted are now generally considered to be authentic. The third speech "Against Aphobos", for instance, is now generally accepted to be authentic. Still other speeches have been generally considered authentic but have had some sections considered to be later additions. The "Third Philippic", for instance, contains text which does not appear in all of the manuscript traditions; it has been suggested that this was a later addition by another writer.
Finally, one of the works which was transmitted as part of the Demosthenic corpus makes no claim to have been written by Demosthenes. This is number 12, the "Epistle of Philip", which claims to be the letter from Philip of Macedon to the people of Athens to which Demosthenes 11, the "Reply to Philip", is a response. Douglas MacDowell believes that this is authentically Philip's letter.
Prologues.
Fifty-six passages bearing the collective title "prooimia" (or "prooimia dēmēgorika") — "(demegoric) prologues" or "preambles, also Exordia" — are extant. These were openings of Demosthenes' speeches, collected by Callimachus for the Library of Alexandria, and preserved in several of the manuscripts that contain Demosthenes' speeches. The passages vary somewhat in length, though most are about one page or slightly less. The majority of the prologues bear no relation to Demosthenes' other extant speeches (only five correspond closely to the beginnings of five of Demosthenes' Assembly speeches), but we have only seventeen public orations by him. The topics that arise vary considerably, and there is no apparent order. The prologues give us insights into the Athenians' attitude to their democracy as well as to the reactions and even expectations of an audience at an Assembly. Callimachus believed that Demosthenes composed them, as also did Julius Pollux and Stobaeus. Modern scholars are divided: Some of them reject them, while others believe they were genuine.
Letters.
Six letters are written under Demosthenes' name, but their authorship has been fiercely debated. J.A. Goldstein regards Demosthenes's letters as authentic apologetic letters that were addressed to the Athenian assembly and asserts that "whether the letters had a spurious origin as propaganda or as rhetorical fictions, the aim of the author would be to present a defense of Demosthenes' career, a simulated self-defense". Ostensibly, the first four were written by Demosthenes during his exile in 323 BC, the fifth in his youth, and the sixth during the Lamian War.
